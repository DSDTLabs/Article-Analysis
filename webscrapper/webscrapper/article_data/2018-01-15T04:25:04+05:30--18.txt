HOWRAH: A 57-year-old engineer with the Public Health Engineering Department was found burnt to death inside a locked room at   in   on Sunday morning.

 The police have registered a case of unnatural death. Initial investigations could not reveal any foul play.
 
 Shantanu   (57), from  , was one of the oldest residents of the area. He grew up in the locality and stayed there till he had shifted to his New Alipore government quarter. Mukherjee had returned to his Howrah residence a few years ago to live with his mother after he started distancing himself from his wife.
 
 While Mukherjee stayed on the first floor of the house, his 79-year-old mother Bandana lived on the ground floor.
 
 On Sunday morning neighbours smelt something burning and noticed black smoke emanating from Mukherjee’s room. They immediately informed the Chatterjeehat police station.
 
 When the police broke open the door, thick smoke had enveloped the room making it difficult to step in. A stench of burning flesh was apparent. They could enter only after firemen had doused the fire.
 
 “He was severely burnt by the time we entered his room. The windows were shut, a bottle of alcohol was kept on the table and cigarette butts were strewn across the room. A mosquito repellent coil was burning in the room making it a virtual gas chamber,” a cop on the case said. 
 
 Prima facie it seems that Mukherjee died after inhaling of carbon monoxide accumulated in the room. ACP (south)   said, “It seems that he suffocated and became unconscious. Later the fire, that probably started from one of the cigarette butts, burnt him. We have sent the body for autopsy.”
