Chandrabindoo vocalist   is busy with his drawing book again. And this time, the singer is telling the story of a girl and her dog, both of whom have become social media sensations. “It was not planned, but as soon as I created these two cartoon characters, they became very popular on my social media pages. So, my paintings started chronicling the life of the two characters — Puchki, the little girl, and Cookie, her pup. Given their popularity, my friends and I are planning to publish a book and hold an exhibition with this series,” Upal told us. 
 
  
 So far, he has drawn 30 paintings in the series. While most of them show the characters going about everyday chores, some strips send social messages. One strip, for instance, shows the little girl clearing garbage in a park, while another pays tribute to the Chipko movement. “Besides, the duo also celebrates our festivals, including   and Bhai Phonta,” said the singer with a smile. 
 
 Earlier, Upal had painted another set of cartoons with similar characters. So, how is the new set different from the previous one? “I’m deeply influenced by Australian artist Shaun Tan’s style. The previous set reflected that. This time, it is an amalgamation of Tan’s simplistic style and British illustrator Quentin Blake’s oddity. Puchki is carefree and lives a life everybody wants to live. She is very much aware of her surroundings too,” said the singer, adding, “I think it is the simplicity and carefree feel that helped the strips gain popularity. There is another point. We are used to see such cartoons through boys’ perspective, like Hergé’s Tintin or   and Albert Uderzo’s   and   series. In this case, everything is taking place through a girl’s activities. I think people found this interesting too.”
