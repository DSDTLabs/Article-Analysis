 Hearing a petition of Nawab challenging the FIR lodged against him in connection with the alleged fraud, the bench directed him to appear before the investigating officer on May 5 and hand over to him all documents demanded by the IO. The court also directed Nawab that he would be available to the IO as and when required.
 
 Earlier, Nawab’s lawyer Arun Sinha pleaded that the land in question belonged to his client’s ancestors since 1920, hence if he accepted compensation, it was no offence.
