NAVI MUMBAI: A large number of people from the   who had gathered at a   were forced to attend the   inside the premises as the police had not given them permission to use loud speakers. 

 The devotees were forced to jostle for space as the church can accommodate only 600 people. Every year the church holds the mass at the spacious quadrangle of Sacred Heart School in sector 4, Vashi.
 
  The police had denied them permission citing a high court directive prohibiting use of loudspeakers in silence zones like educational institutions.
 
 “Several devotees were compelled to occupy the space on a concealed nullah outside the church and some of them even occupied the pavement,” Gracy Dsouza, a sacred heart parishioner said. 
 
 The police are denying permission because of a local activist who has complained about noise pollution due to use of loud speakers during the mass conducted at the school premises, Dsouza said. 
 
 Father Gerald Fernandes said, “We have abided by the HC order. Though it is causing inconvenience to the devotees, the Christian community has always been law abiding.” —George Mendonca
