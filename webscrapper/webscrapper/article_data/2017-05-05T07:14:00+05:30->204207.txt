Manali: The number of foreign tourists visiting Kullu-Manali has decreased by 16000 over the past five years with only a few high end foreigners showing interest in visiting the hill district.

 Kullu district saw a surge in number of foreign tourists after 2005 till 2012. Both 2011-12 witnessed highest number of foreigner tourists which were recorded to be 1.38 lakh and 1.43 lakh respectively. Since then the number of foreign tourists’ arrival has dwindled. 2013 (1.25 lakh) and 2014 (1.04 lakh) witnessed a drop in the count while 2015 and 2016 recorded 1.09 lakh and 1.22 lakh tourists respectively showing a gradual improvement.
 
 Safety and security concerns are now forcing even the high end foreign tourists to think twice before planning adventure trip to the Himalayas. Though the Chandigarh-Manali national highway is set to become four-laned, the present road is in bad condition, which is further proving as a deterrence to the tourists. Travel agents say majority of foreigners come here for adventure activities like trekking, climbing, motorbiking and other activities. Kaushal Bhardwaj from Discover Himalaya, a leading adventure tour company, said, “Unlike many developed nations, we don’t have advanced safety, rescue and medical services. They have air-ambulance services for tourists. Now high end tourists while enquiring ask about safety systems that we lack. We don’t have satellite phone facility. We don’t have dedicated tourist security system. These are some of the reasons why many of them are afraid of visiting Himalayas.”
 
 Manali has been in news abroad after incidents of gangrapes with an American and an Israeli tourist were reported in recent years. Some tourists stay put from Kullu-Manali seeing the district as a favourite amongst marijuana lovers.
 
 Contrary to foreigners, Kullu district has recorded an increase in domestic tourists’ arrival. According to data from Himachal Tourism department, 26.59 lakh domestic tourists visited tourists in 2011 and the count has reached 35.15 lakh in 2016.
