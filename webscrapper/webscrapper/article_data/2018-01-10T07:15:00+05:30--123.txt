Ludhiana: The Ludhiana municipal corporation (MC) will now handle operation and maintenance of streetlights on the Southern Bypass road.

 Earlier, the public works department (PWD) was handling the task, but MC took over the same after a request by PWD.
 
 The technical advisory committee (TAC) of the MC has given its consent to take over the task. If residents find these streetlights nonfunctional, they should contact MC officials.
 
 MC officials claimed that there are 852 streetlights on this stretch. Before taking over the lights, the civic body had asked the PWD officials to fix the same. The MC got the street lights checked twice and they found 90% of the lights functional, following which the TAC gave its nod.
 
 One of the officials claimed that residents used to call them for the repair of streetlights and this was the reason why they took over the operation and maintenance work. He said people in the past lodged several complaints about nonfunctional streetlights.
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh said they have given nod to the proposal of taking over the operation and maintenance of streetlights on Southern bypass. He said they would ensure all the lights remain functional.
