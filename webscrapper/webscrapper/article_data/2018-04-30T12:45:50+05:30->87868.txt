There were plenty of whistles, cheers and catcalls as the mega fans of Tollywood turned out in big numbers from across the Telugu states, for the pre-release event of upcoming Allu Arjun-starrer ‘Naa Peru Surya – Naa Illu India’. The film marks the directorial debut of Vakkantham Vamsi and tells the story of a soldier, who will do anything for the country. Actor   was the chief guest for the film and said he was proud of the film his brother   has chosen. 

 
  
 
  “The film is honest and inspiring to watch. It's a very proud moment for me to see my brother doing an Army-based film,” he quipped. 
 Charan, who has just delivered a massive blockbuster with ‘Rangasthalam’, said that the Telugu film industry is going through a positive phase at the moment.
 
 
  
 
  “We always look up to Tamil films as they produce sensible cinema. For some reason, Telugu films haven’t got many critically acclaimed and commercial films. However, in the last two years, critically acclaimed films also became super hits. So it’s a wonderful time to be in this industry,” he said. 
 
 
  
 
  Allu Arjun, who plays the role of a soldier in the film, says the director will deserve credit if it’s a success. “The first thank you is to the Indian Army. When this script first came to me, I felt truly proud and wanted to do this. I've always wanted to make an honest film like this and I'm grateful for Vamsi to bring this to me,” he said. 
 
 
  
 
    Naa Illu India features   as the female lead, and the actress was all praise for Bunny, who she described as a “fabulous co-star.” “One of the things that strikes me the most about Allu Arjun is that he's never satisfied. He always wants to be the best at what he does,” the actress said.
 
 
  
  True to the film’s patriotic nature, Allu Arjun requested everybody to sing the national anthem to bring proceedings to a close.
