Mangaluru: St Aloysius College management has clarified that only two or three students complained of certain symptoms for which they were treated.  He said an earlier report of 100 boys testing positive for jaundice, as reported in these columns regarding a jaundice outbreak at St Aloysius on January 18, were incorrect. Rev Dr Praveen Martis, principal of St Aloysius College, in a release, stated that there were only one or two cases of very mild infection. He alleged that a panic was created by some rumour mongers, that hundreds of students were afflicted with jaundice.
