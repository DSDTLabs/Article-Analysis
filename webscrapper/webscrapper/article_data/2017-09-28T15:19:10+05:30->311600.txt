CHENNAI:  , affectionately called 'Judy Miss' by generations of students at Don Bosco School in Chennai, had been a kindergarten teacher for 31 years. 

 She was loved by her students and colleagues for her kind and gentle nature. She passed away here on August 27, and her family has announced an annual   from 2018 onwards for the 'Kindest Teacher in Chennai' in memory of her. 
 
 At her memorial service at   on September 27, attended by Don Bosco alumni, teachers and senior government officials including DGP T K Rajendran, her son Sanjay Pinto, lawyer and former TV journalist, recalled his mother's motto of treating every child in her class like her own. 
 
 â€œIn this age of corporal punishment and child abuse, my mother's legacy of kindness must live on. In keeping with Don Bosco's credo 'not by blows but by kind words', it was remarkable that she never ever scolded a student in her three decade long stint in the school, evident from the messages I've been flooded with from her students all over the world. We usually have awards for teachers based on academic results or projects that they supervised. But one exclusively for kindness is perhaps a first of its kind," he said. 
 
 The award will carry a cash prize and a citation, based on entries from students and parents of all schools in Chennai, whether private, government, aided, unaided, matriculation, ICSE or CBSE. The winner will be chosen by a jury nominated by the Pinto family. The award will be presented on her first death anniversary (August 27, 2018).
