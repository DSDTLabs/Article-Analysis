JALANDHAR: After Punjab chief minister   claimed that violence against Sikhs in Delhi had started even before   landed in the national capital on October 31, 1984, Sikh activists and bodies have cited chronology of events to drive home the point that the first incidence of violence started after the latter reached Delhi.

 Joining issue with Amarinder, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)   and senior advocate H S Phoolka, who is counsel for the riot victims, tweeted saying that former’s statement was “factually incorrect.” He also tagged the Punjab CM. “Rajiv arrived around 4 pm in Delhi. First attack on any Sikh took place at 5.30 pm on President Zail Singh at AIIMS where   was present,”   tweeted.
 
 
 Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) and Dal Khalsa cited former President Pranab Mukherjee’s memoir “The Turbulent Years” to counter Amarinder’s claim that violence started even before Rajiv landed.
 
 “Capt Amarinder Singh is firing in the dark. He either does not want to speak the truth or he has been directed by the Gandhi family to tell a lie,” said DSGMC president Manjit Singh GK in a statement issued on Monday.
 
 “At 4.30 pm,   leader G K Moopnar had even met President Giani Zail Singh to handover the letter that Rajiv had been made leader of the Congress in the Parliament. What is Captain’s argument on the attack on Giani Zail Singh’s convoy and his bodyguard only after Gandhi had arrived in Delhi at 4 pm. President’s convoy was attacked when he went to AIIMS to see   and first stone was thrown by Congress councillor Arjan Dass,” G K said, releasing two photographs—one showing damaged wind screen of a car of the President and the other showing his injured Sikh security guard without turban.
 
 Meanwhile, Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh, while citing Mukherjee’s memoir, said it was a pity that Amarinder was siding with mass murderers thus rubbing salt on the wounds of the aggrieved community.
