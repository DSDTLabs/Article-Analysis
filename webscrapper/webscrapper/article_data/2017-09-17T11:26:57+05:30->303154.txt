JALANDHAR: Punjab BJP’s election committee has finalized a panel of two names — late MP Vinod Khanna’s wife Kavita Khanna and senior party leader   — as potential candidates of the party for the Gurdaspur   bypolls. The names have been sent to the party high command and   parliamentary board will take the final call. 

 The meeting of the state election committee was held at Jalandhar on Saturday. It was presided over by Punjab BJP president Vijay Sampla. The Union minister said that they had sent their recommendations and final decision would be taken by the central leadership of the party. Sources privy to the proceedings of the meeting revealed that even though names of BJP’s Sujanpur MLA Dinesh Singh former CPS Jagdish Sahni and former BJP state chief Ashwani Sharma were also doing round but the committee shortlisted only two names. 
 
 Salaria was contender during 2014 election also but then late Bollywood actor   managed to retain his seat. Those batting for ticket to Khanna’s widow believe that sympathy factor would be in her favour. However, Salaria has been focussing on the seat and he even advertised medical initiatives by his Chintpurni Medical College, Parthankot, for the welfare of the constituents.
 
 Those who participated in the meeting included state BJP organizing secretary Dinesh Kumar, general secretary Tarun Chugh, Rajya Sabha MP Shvet Malik, former minister Punjab Manoranjan Kalia and former state party presidents professor Rajinder Bhandari and Ashwani Sharma.
