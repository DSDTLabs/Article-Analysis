GUWAHATI: Education minister   on Tuesday said five new 'model' colleges, named after BJP ideologue  , will start functioning in the state from August. 

 He said the colleges set up at Behali, Dalgaon, Karimganj, Bongaigaon and Goalpara by the government will start a new chapter in the education history of the state. 
 
 Barring a few government colleges, most degree colleges of the state have been set up at the initiative of the public and were later recognized by the state government.
 
 Sources in the state government said as the five colleges have been completed with the Centre's fund and as the name of Deendayal Upadhyaya has been attached to them, these educational institutions are likely to propagate the ideals of the philosopher and scholar in future. 
 
 Initially, the colleges will start functioning with one stream each.
 
 "Students will get national exposure after passing out from a college named after Deendayal Upadhyaya who is one of the greatest scholars the country has ever produced," Sarma said. He added that the faculty members of the five   will receive their appointment letters on August 4. 
 
 Sarma said the construction work for seven other model colleges is on and work on three of them at Karbi Anglong, Cachar and Nagaon respectively will be over by next year. 
 
 "As per the new education policy, the government will set up the educational institutes wherever there is a demand from people and whenever the government feels the necessity," he added. 
 
 The education minister said the state government will also start 11 new polytechnic institutes in the state by September. 
 
 Sarma added that after clearing all legal hurdles, the state government has decided to appoint heads in 626 government-run schools of the state and 146 assistant headmasters on August 7.
