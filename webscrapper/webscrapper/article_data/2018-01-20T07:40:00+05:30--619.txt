Chandigarh: Municipal corporation, Chandigarh, in a survey, has registered 8,700   out of 21,622. Sources in the MC attributed this decline to the fact that only Chandigarh residents were accepted. “We have strictly registered vendors who are UT residents with Adhaar cards of the city. Since our priority is city-based vendors, we have registered them. So far as the Adhaar card holders of other states are concerned, senior officers are yet to take a decision on it,” an MC official said. The civic authorities have set up an office on the MC’s premises where the unregistered ones can register. 

 “It has also come to the notices of officials that during the survey four to five members of the same family got themselves enrolled in the survey, but since now they have to pay for each person, they are reluctant to come and thus it is also one of the reasons behind the declining the number of registered vendors”, he added.
 
 Though, the issue of outside Adhaar based vendors had come up in the last monthly house meeting, where some of the municipal councilors had asked MC officials to register those vendors too. 
 
 They claimed many people have been working in the city for the past many years, but don’t have Chandigarh’s Adhaar but are sticking to the Adhaar of their native state. On this officers advised them to ask such vendors to convert their Adhaar number to a Chandigarh number.
 
 On the other hand, the engineering department of the civic body has also kicked-off the tender process to construct the temporary vending sites for the vending zones in different municipal wards in Chandigarh. Once these temporary vending sites would be completed then the vendors of all the municipal wards would be shifted in a phased manner.
