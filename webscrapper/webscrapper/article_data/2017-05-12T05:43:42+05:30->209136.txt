INDORE: In yet another case of hospital horror in Indore, MP, a man died unattended at the gates of MY Hospital on Wednesday.

 By the time passers-by saw him and raised alarm, flesh-eating ants were crawling all over his body. He is yet to be identified and it’s not known if he came on his own or was abandoned. But no one bothered to check on him as he lay at the gates although hospital staff, doctors and attendants passed him by.
 
 “The body of a middle-aged man was lying unattended near the casualty ward. It was sent to the mortuary by the time cops from the hospital outpost were informed,” said head constable Ramgopal Verma of Sanyogitaganj police station.
 
 No one had come to claim the body, he said. “A case has been registered,” Verma said.
