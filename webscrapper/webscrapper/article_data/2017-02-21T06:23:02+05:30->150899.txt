MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday told the state government to issue a notification to the police across  , not to allow loudspeakers in silence zones.

 A bench headed by Justice   said in the absence of the apex court's stay on its judgment about not allowing use of loudspeaker in silence zones, the government could issue a notification restricting permissions in “silence zones as defined by the court“.
 
 Last August, the court passed a detailed judgment which stated that loudspeakers could not be permitted in a silence zone. The state moved the apex court, challenging a portion of this judgment to know if such a notification would be required.
 
 The state's advocate,  , said a monitoring committee will be formed at the district level to deal with noise pollution complaints. He said the composition of the panel was still to be decided. He said a common format has been laid to grant permission.
 
 Justice Oka said, “There should be a column stating whether loudspeakers would be used in a silence zone.“
 
 The bench has sought details of action taken after viola tions were recorded through newly obtained decibel meters.Told of police action in 66 noise complaints in   from June to November, it sought the state's response.“We'll take a serious view,“ said Justice Oka.
 
 The bench said it would issue notices to officers for contempt of court and recommend disciplinary action be taken against them.
