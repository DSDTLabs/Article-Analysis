It is always the villain who makes the hero more powerful, exactly the way Jennifer makes   powerful.  , who portrays the most cunning villain in the   show  , is a cute and soft-spoken lady in real life. 

 Tanvi loves to play negative roles as she feels those characters gives her more opportunities to showcase her real talent to the audience. She hates to be the 'paavam' tear clad heroine in serials and always wants to be the strong and bold villain who is more expressive.
  
  
 
 Tanvi left her dream job at Trivandrum International airport to pursue her longtime passion towards acting. She took this chance with the belief that ' one can be an Air-hostess with little experience in the field', but for an actress like her, without any acting background, is really tough to break into the small screen. She started her career as a model but later got a chance to act in a movie called Life Diary, which is presently in its post-production phase. It was while working in her first serial   that she got the offer to be Revathy in   which was the real break for Tanvi.
 
 The depth and talent of this actress were understood when she was actually slapped in public for torturing th eir favorite hero. Tanvi shares her experience when she was actually pushed and scolded in public by a grandma for her evil acts towards  , the heroine in Ratri Mazha. Even though this experience created panic for a few minutes, these reactions are her achievements and awards of her acting career. 
  
 Currently, Tanvi is in the limelight for her three-in-one villainous character in the show Parasparam in which she acts as Jennifer, Vinitha, and Merin.
 
 Just like any other actor, Tanvi also eyes to feature on the big screen but presently she is happy with the family like atmosphere she has in the television industry. Tanvi is always open to good stories and will be cautious while choosing her big-screen role when it comes her way.
