HYDERABAD: After covering about 8,000 km by walking and using various public transport, Kiran   has finally reached Hyderabad. The 33-year-old had started his mission from Srinagar's   on January 26, 2018 and has travelled 12 states in last three months. 

 Verma, a former marketing head at a Noida-based university, had set out on a mission to spread awareness among people about blood donation. "I try to encourage at least 10 people every km and explain them about the importance of blood donation. My target is to create awareness among 1.5 lakh Indians after completion of 15,000 km," he said.
 
 Verma lost his mother to cancer. "I realised the value of every drop of blood when I donated blood for the first time for one of my teachers, who was suffering from a kidney disease." The reaction of his teacher's son moved him and it was a major turning point in his life.
 
 Beside this awareness  , he continues to donate blood. He has donated blood about 40 times till date. 
 
 Verma also recalled a horrible experience when a group of people took advantage of his humanitarian move. "People in Delhi knew that I donate blood for the poor. One morning, I received a call and the caller asked me to donate blood for a poor man. After donating blood, I came to know that the person had taken 1,500," he said, explaining how illegal blood donation rackets are operating in the city. 
 
 After this incident, Verma created an app, Simply Blood, which connects a donor and a receiver for free. "Over 2,000 people from across the world have benefited through this app," Verma added.
