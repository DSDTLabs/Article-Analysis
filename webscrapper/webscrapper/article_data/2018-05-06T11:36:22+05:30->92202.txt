MUMBAI: Kolkata Knight Riders, who take on the   at the   on Sunday, are in an enviable position. The solidity of the composition of the team is such that they can't promote talented youngster   up the order, unless there is an untoward occurrence.

 
 When the in-form   was ruled out with a back injury during their match against   on Thursday, Gill was promoted up the order. The India under-19 World Cup star walked out to bat at No. 4 in the fifth over of KKR's chase with the scoreboard reading 40-2. He justified the promotion by stroking his way to a sublime unbeaten 57, as he shared an unfinished match-winning 83-run partnership with skipper   (45*) for the fifth wicket to see his side home in 17.4 overs..
 
 If ex-India star and a senior in the team,   is to be believed, Gill will have to wait a while longer for his turn to bask in glory.
 
 "Nitish (Rana) gives us the flexibility of having a leftright combination. Also, we cannot afford to send DK (Karthik) lower than the No. 5 position. So, yeah in that regard, Shubman will not regularly find a spot at the top four or five. That is the reason why Shubman found himself batting at 6 and 7. Basically we used him as a floater," Uthappa said on Saturday.
 
 The dashing opener admitted that it was a good problem to have. "It all depends on the situation. But I think it's a good problem to have," Uthappa said.
