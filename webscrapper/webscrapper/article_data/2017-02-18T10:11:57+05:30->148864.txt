NEW DELHI:   won a silver medal in   at the Common wealth Youth Games in Australia In 2004. Two years later, he won a bronze at the SAF Games held in Colombo. The former international athlete has made news, but for an entirely different reason - he was among three people arrested with a massive consignment of meow, the newest party drug in town.

 Around 25kg of the drug worth more than Rs 50 crore has been seized from the trio, police said.
 
 This, however, isn't 30year-old Singh's first brush with infamy. He was earlier suspended for testing positive for banned steroids in a national competition. The Delhi-based athlete tried to make a comeback but was forced to quit the sport after getting injured while training for the 2010 Commonwealth Games.
 
 Police said Singh dabbled in real estate for a while before entering the shady world of drug-dealing. The other arrested men are Amandeep Singh, 29, and Harnish Sarpal, 36, all from west Delhi.
 
 DCP (special cell)   said that the south-western range had received information that Amandeep was flying to Mumbai to receive the drug consignment from an international syndicate and would return early Wednesday. 
 
 “A special team led by ACP Akhilesh Yadav and inspector Tilak Chandra Bisht was formed and a trap laid at all entry and exit points of the New Delhi railway station. The informer had tipped us off that Singh and his associate had boarded a Dadar-Amritsar train and would reach Delhi with the drugs. At 6.15am, two men were spotted waiting at the State Entry Road parking gate.
 
 “At the informer's instance, sleuths approached the two. But they started running. They were nabbed after a hot chase,” Yadav said. They were identified as Hardeep and Amandeep. Hanish was later arrested on their disclosures. The cops are now hunting for gang members active in Mumbai and other parts of the country.
