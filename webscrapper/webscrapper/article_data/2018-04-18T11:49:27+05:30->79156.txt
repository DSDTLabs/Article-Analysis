 has been busy in both Mollywood and Kollywood this year. Till the start of last year, the situation was markedly different for the actor. He says he owes it all to the success of  , which released in March 2017.

 “I think Oru Mexican Aparatha last March was what made me a bankable actor. It’s also got to do with Guppy being appreciated by people, not in theatres, but when the DVD was out,” he says.
 
 The actor was also roped in for   before Oru Mexican Aparatha’s release. “Godha was announced by then and I was also part of Ezra. Prithviraj had asked the makers why cast someone who plays a leading role for a cameo. But I didn’t see any problem doing it because I think that too helped Oru Mexican Aparatha as my visibility increased due to me being part of a superstar film. I believe people start liking you when you are part of star-studded films and only after that you can shoulder your own movie,” he says.
 
  is currently awaiting the release of his Tamil debut Abhiyum Anuyum and also  , which is a political satire that has him playing a chain-smoker.
