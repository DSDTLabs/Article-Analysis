NEW DELHI: Seeking to make Delhi as clean as Washington, London and Tokyo, chief minister   called upon   to put all their energy into fighting the municipal polls and steer the party to victory.

 Kerjiwal once again reiterated the promise of bringing swaraj (self-rule) in municipal corporations and taking participatory governance to the grassroots. In an emotional appeal to volunteers — via a video message on   on Saturday evening — Kejriwal said that cleaning the city will be top priority if   wins the civic polls. He set out a roadmap for the future involving the common man in municipal projects.
 
 “The money will be spent as per the people’s wishes and people will be asked if the work in their ward has been executed according to their wishes. Only if they are satisfied will payment be made to the contractor,” Kejriwal said.
 
 Following the Punjab and Goa election results, Kejriwal and deputy CM   sought to boost the morale of the AAP volunteers through the video. 
 
 “The outcome of the Punjab results should not scare us. Our struggle is on. You are fighting against big forces and the fight is not easy,” Kejriwal said.
