Coimbatore: Farmers from Sulur on Monday petitioned the district collector seeking compensation as the corn seeds they had got from the agricultural department failed to produce yield. 

 About 100 farmers from Nadupalayam in Sulur said they had spent more than Rs 13,000 an acre for planting the seeds. 
 
 “We got the seeds six months ago and planted them two months later. The crop stopped growing midway and we could not harvest,” said Su Palanisami, president of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association. 
 
 He said in Sulur alone the crop had been planted in 200 acres. “Farmers in Jallipatti and Sultanpettai also had planted the crop. They also have said the crop had failed to grow,” Palanisami added.
 
 Palanisami said they had demanded Rs 15,000 an acre for the loss. “Several farmers have been affected heavily by the loss,” he added. He said the seeds were brought from Palladam and distributed through the seed centre in Sulur.
 
 On the other hand, an official from the agricultural department said the farmers had got the seeds last year and sowed the first foundation, the first batch of seeds, and produced yield. “This October we produced the second foundation and supplied it to farmers. They are now saying the crop has not provided yield,” the official said.
 
 The official added that department officials had interacted with the farmers. “The department would look into the issue and decide about the compensation to the farmers who had sowed the seeds,” he said. 
 
 In Coimbatore district, corn is cultivated in about 1,000 acres across Pollachi, Kenathukadavu, Annur, Sirumugai and Mettupalayam areas.
