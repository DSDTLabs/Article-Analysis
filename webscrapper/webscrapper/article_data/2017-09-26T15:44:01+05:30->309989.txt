 who hasn’t been in the news much these days after ‘Vangaveeti’, is planning on a comeback with a biopic on NTR and his widow Lakshmi Parvathi.

  has already generated for the film since he announced the project and its name ‘Lakshmi’s NTR’. He posted on social media, “After finishing my complete entire research on NTR, I judiciously realized that instead of a biopic on NTR, the same biopic on NTR from the ultra pure understanding of LAKSHMI PARVATHI is what which will actually truthfully provide much more pneumatic insights into the vagaries of those situations surrounding those tumultuous times..Am so excited to embark on this inception.” (sic)
 
 He added, “The film " " will make naked and expose all the real truths behind the true lies of those who punched in his stomach and stabbed his back .."LAKSHMI's NTR" will be the true story of the real actual total truth behind what actually really happened in NTR's life especially towards the end.” (sic)
 
 Recent reports stated that actor   who has starred in many of RGV’s films will be producing the biopic. But RGV himself took to social media and posted, “News reports circulating that JD Chakravarthy is producing Lakshmi's NTR are totally wrong.” (sic)
 
 Guess those excited about the pair coming together again will have to wait!
