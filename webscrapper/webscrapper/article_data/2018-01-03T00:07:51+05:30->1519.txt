MUMBAI: The BMC has cracked the whip on several   for illegal preparation of food in areas other than designated  . It has ordered that the illegal activity be stopped with immediate effect.

 On Tuesday, civic authorities said cooking is allowed in kitchens but not anywhere else. Civic sources said the illegality came to light during inspections in the aftermath of the tragic   blaze.
 
 Jeevak Ghedamal, assistant municipal commissioner of C-Ward, said all gymkhanas in Marine Drive—Catholic, Hindu, Islam, Parsi and Police —have been told to ensure that food is not prepared in any space apart from the designated kitchen area. “While the gymkhanas have been given permission to cook in kitchen areas, we have found that for functions like marriages, food is cooked in open spaces. This cannot be allowed. A warning has already been issued to them. If they continue, we will be forced to seize their wares,” he said.
 
 Confirming the instructions issued, gymkhana authorities said they only cook indoors for their members. “Even for the new year’s dance, we managed with our own kitchen. But what happens in case of weddings or functions held in the open grounds outside? The caterer would suffer as he is not allowed to cook anything in the open,” said  , secretary, Catholic Gymkhana.
