NAGPUR: City lad Dr Saurabh   moved to the US nearly a decade ago to study internal medicine and gastroenterology. He will be participating as a speaker in Gastrocon 2018, to be held on February 17 and 18. Mukewar, who is currently a faculty at   medical Center in Los Angeles, aims to return to India to deliver quality health care to people.

 Talking of trends in Gastroenterology, Mukewar says that in time to come, gastroenterologists will be able to tackle obesity, which is rapidly emerging as a major health problem. "When you are anywhere between obese to super obese, gastroenterologists will be able to treat you. Obesity is very prevalent in the US, and weight loss by way of Endoscopy Sleeve Gastroplasty will become an option.
 
 "Endoscopy Sleeve Gastroplasty works on the principle of fitting a suturing device in the stomach which can tighten the skin, and result in 15 to 20 per cent weight loss,‚Äù he said. He also said that liver transplants will become more common. He urged people to pledge for organ donation, and added that weight loss supplements can potentially result in death due to liver failure.
