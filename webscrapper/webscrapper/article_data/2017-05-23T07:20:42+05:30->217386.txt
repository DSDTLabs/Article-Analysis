NEW DELHI: Confusion prevails over the entry of iconic American electric carmaker   into India with company founder   that current regulations in the country may delay its debut here. In a response to a tweet regarding the brand’s entry into India this year or in 2018,   said, “Maybe I’m misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn’t yet exist in India to support that.” The tweet runs contrary to an earlier one that Musk had sent in February this year when he said that the company will enter the Indian market by summer in 2017. Industry officials expressed surprise at Musk’s tweet as there is no 30% sourcing condition in the automobile industry. Tesla had stated last year that it plans to enter India with its Model 3 in 2017 as it began the global roll-out of the vehicle.
