NASHIK: Three athletes from the city — Deepak Bhosale, Manik Nikam and  , all over 50 years old — recently participated in the   and completed it in time, proving that age is just a number.

 For 55-year-old Deepak age is not a factor as he shared his experience of completing the Triathlon with ease. The event included 5 km running, 1 km swimming and 20-km cycling that he completed in 1.5 hours.
 
 “Every day I go for swimming. Once in a week I do cycling, running and trekking. I also go to the gym for strengthening and building up stamina. I also follow a proper diet,” he said when asked about the secret behind his success.
 
 Deepak had participated in the Pune Triathlon last year as well and had stood first in the Nashik Triathlon held a few years ago.
 
 Manik participated in the Olympic Triathlon: 1,500 m swimming, 40 km cycling and 10 km running. “I am a marathoner and participate in 42 km and 21 km   regularly. I have been cycling every day for one-and-a-half year. I cycle, swim and run every day,” he said.
 
 Sunil, however, participated in the triathlon with his teenage children Sakshi and Saahil. He completed the 1 km swimming, 20-km cycling and 5-km running event in 2.1 hours.
 
 “I had earlier participated in the 6 km swimming conducted by   in Malwan. Sakshi’s highest record in swimming is 30 km. Both Sakshi and Saahil hold   and we were told by the Pune Triathlon organisers that they are in the first or second position in the event held recently. They will soon inform us about it,” he said.
