HYDERABAD: An adulterated coal making racket was busted by   police after conducting raids on two coal mixing units in   and   on Friday. 

 Eleven persons were arrested and 450 metric tonnes of coal worth Rs 23 lakh, seven trucks, a   earthmover and a tractor were seized. However, owners of both the units are on the run.
 
 During the raid at Ibrahimpatnam, cops arrested Kottapally Lakshmaiah, the supervisor of the unit, along with seven workers and a driver. Owner of the coal unit G Raju is absconding. 
 
 Raju's modus operandi was to procure 'C' grade coal from Kothagudem, Koyagudem, Illendu and Manuguru at Rs 4,000 per metric tonne and 'F' grade coal at Rs 2,300 a metric tonne. 
 
 "He would then mix the coal stocks in   unit and sell it to brick manufacturers at Rs 5,000 to Rs 5,800 per metric tonne," a police official said. 
 
 In all, 200 metric tonnes of coal worth Rs 11 lakh along with seven lorries, tractor and the JCB were seized.
 
 In the second incident, police arrested Gaddam Shiva Kumar Reddy, supervisor of the unit, at Malkapuram in Choutuppal along with a driver. Owner  , however, escaped. 
 
 Police said that Malla Reddy procured low grade coal from a company and then mixed it with black stones. He would then load them in lorries in an isolated place at Malkapuram and sell it to brick manufacturers. 
 
 Cops recovered 250 metric tonnes of coal worth Rs 12 lakh from the unit. 
 
 A manhunt has been launched by the police to nab both the owners of the illegal coal mixing units.
