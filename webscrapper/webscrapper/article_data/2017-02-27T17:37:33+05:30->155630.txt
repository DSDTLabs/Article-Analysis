MADURAI: The   bench of the Madras high court on Monday directed the   government to enact a law with prohibitory and penal clauses within two months to eradicate   trees (prosopis juliflora). It also directed the government to release perennial funds to the district collectors in the state for removing of the seemai karuvelam trees.
 
 The seemai karuvelam tree that sucks a lot of water has invaded into water bodies and dry lands of government and private people. Since such trees ultimately affect the agricultural activities, a batch of cases for their eradication was filed before the high court bench.
 
 The court, which had ordered removal of those trees in the thirteen districts that come under its jurisdiction, on February 10 directed to remove those trees in the entire state. Accordingly, the authorities concerned in the districts are taking steps in that regard.
 
 Last week, the judges of the high court inspected the task to remove the trees in the districts of Madurai and Sivaganga.
 
 The batch of cases came up for further hearing on Monday, during which the government side filed reports of the collectors with regard to removal of the trees.
 
 After scrutinising the records, the bench said effective steps needed to be taken in some places for the purpose of task. It then said, “On considering the evils of existence of seemai karuvelam trees, the state is directed to pass an Act with prohibitory and penal clauses within two months and also to release perennial funds to all districts for the purpose of removing the seemai karuvelam trees.”
  
 The bench further said it would make surprise inspection throughout the state. “If any lapse is found, the same will be viewed seriously,” the bench said and posted the case to March 20 for further hearing.
