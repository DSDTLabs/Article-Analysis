NAGPUR: Confusion prevails in  , Bahujan Samajwadi Party and Nationalist   Party over the number of distribution of Form B as the deadline for withdrawal of nominations for the February 21 Nagpur   elections ends on Tuesday.

 The NMC has received 1,810 candidatures including those from mainstream political parties, independents and rebels for the civic elections. As February 3 was the last day for filing papers, all political parties preferred to distribute Form B only on the last day to keep a check on rebels for civic polls for the 151 civic wards. Shiv Sena, NCP and BSP continued to distribute Form B to all disgruntled members of the   and Congress.
 
 In the process, all the three parties are still gathering details about the number of official candidates who have actually filed papers in each ward due to last-minute scramble for Form B and entry of rebels in the fray, admitted senior leaders from BSP and Shiv Sena while speaking to TOI.
 
 BSP claimed that the party fielded 107 candidates and yet, it is not sure how many of them managed to get Form B. NCP and its alliance party too released its lists of candidates and the figure actually is around 150. Shiv Sena, which too claims to have distributed 120 Form B, is still not clear how many of its candidates have actually filled the forms. It too claimed that its exact number of candidates in fray will be known only after withdrawal of nominations ends.
 
 “A clear picture as to how many are contesting will emerge after scrutiny, which was done on February 4 and withdrawal of candidature on Tuesday, as many from the mainstream parties and independents filed papers,” an official from NMC’s election department said.
 
 In the present House, BJP ruled the civic body for a second time by winning in 62 seats, as against 41 by Congress, 12 by BSP and six each by NCP and Shiv Sena.
 
 A clear picture about the rebel factor is expected to emerge on Tuesday — the last day for withdrawal of nominations.
