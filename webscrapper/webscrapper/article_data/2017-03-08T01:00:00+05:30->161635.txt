Gymming is not trendy or even common among women in this small locality in  . In fact, the neighbours see it as quite odd. However, for the past 10 years, Mithilesh Arora has been that kind of exception here. Every morning, she hits the gym for weight training, toning exercises, muscle training and a combination of exercises that she was once told "only men who aspired to become bouncers should follow." But she soon learnt from her bouncer husband that stamina comes from the right diet. "Jab shuru kiya tha, toh sharam bhi aati thi sab male bouncers ke beech training karne mein. Ghar par hi sochti thi kaise jaungi kaam karne, kisi ne kuch bol diya aur main kuch nahin kar payi toh? Par jab pehli baar male bouncers ke rehte bhi maine situation sambhali, uske baad confidence aaya," says Mithilesh, who works as a bouncer at various nightclubs and private events in the city. 

  
 Mehrun Nisha, a bouncer at Social in Hauz Khas Village, had always dreamt of becoming a police officer. She tells us, "My father was totally against women going out and working. Unhone meri NCC ki uniform jala daali. He told me, 'Jab maine teri maa ko aaj tak ghar se bahar nahin nikalne diya toh tujhe naukri kaise karne dunga?' My mother also failed to convince my dad, and I gave up under family pressure, but later, when my family incurred financial losses, I decided to take matters into my own hands." She adds, "After this, my father cried. I thought chalo, police officer na sahi, bouncer hi sahi, dhaakad toh dikhna hi tha â€“ that was my dream."  , who proudly boasts that she changed the way   are addressed today, says, "Humari uniform ladkon jaisi hai, mehnat bhi utni hi karte hain, duty hours bhi wahi hain, phir bhi log humein 'security guard' kehte thay. I started telling people that I was a female bouncer, not a security guard who checks bags and frisks females at entry points." She adds, "I have to look like men, mujhe gaaliyaan bhi ladkon ki tarah maarni hai, aur peetna bhi hai logon ko. I often wondered why aadmi wahi kaam kare toh usko izzat se bouncer bolte thay, hum wahi kaam karein aur kahein ki humein bouncer kaho toh hanste thay hum par."

 Vibha Shukla, a female bouncer, tells us, "Once, a guest touched me inappropriately at a club in a five-star hotel, and I pushed him aside with full force. He accused me of misbehaving. Aisa bhi hota hai jab log badtameezi karte hain humare saath, aur sochte hain ki naukri bachaane ke liye yeh chup rahengi." Mehrun Nisha adds, "Aise log sochte hain ki aurat hai toh kuch gaali ya gandi baat sun kar aage baat nahin badhaayegi, par aise logon se main unki bhaasha mein baat karti hun, ke 'samajh raha hai, mhaara khoon bhi utna hi uble hai jitna tera, cheer ke rakh dungi.'"
 
  
 Vibha tells us, "At a Gurgaon store, where I'm working currently, we caught a bunch of youngsters shoplifting. They started arguing and told me 'dekh lenge tujhe'. Yeh toh bachche thay, Gurgaon mein log pata nahin kya kya bolte hain, bahut toh personal cheezon par aa jate hain. Par hum chup rehte hain. After the recent pub brawls, we have become very cautious."
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  Himani Singh, who is just a year old in this profession, and her mother, also a female bouncer, prefers that Himani work at events that are held at malls or offices, rather than going to restaurants or clubs. She says, "Humari shifts late night tak hoti hain, aur security ka humein male bouncers se zyaada dhyaan rakhna padta hai." Jyoti Ahuja, another bouncer from Badarpur, adds, "Delhi ke nightclubs mein crowd bahut ganda ho gaya hai. I work at various clubs in Hauz Khas, aisa lagta hai zyaadatar chhichhore idhar aate hain. Log kuch bhi bol kar chale jaate hain, darr lagta hai thoda jab duty se raat ko 12-1 baje ghar jaate hain."
