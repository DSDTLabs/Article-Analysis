PATNA: One has heard of   or a parking lot, but daredevil vehicle lifters have now caused panic among four-wheeler dealers as they stole away two brand new SUVs from two showrooms in Patna since December 20 last year.

 In the latest incident, a Scorpio kept on display at the Mahindra showroom near RPS Mor was stolen around 2.30am on Wednesday.
 
 Earlier, another brand new Scorpio was stolen from the Mahindra showroom in   on December 20. Both the showrooms belong to HAV Motors.
 
 More than 100 days on, police have failed to recover the SUV stolen from Pataliputra showroom. However, the vehicle stolen from the RPS Mor showroom was recovered outside a house at Jandaha in Vaishali district on Thursday morning.
 
 Danapur police station   Sandeep Kumar Singh said three people, including two former employees of the RPS Mor showroom, were arrested in connection with the theft.
 
 According to the SHO, the arrested men are Rohit Kumar (22), Imran Ansari (23) and Dharmendra Kumar (35). Rohit and Imran earlier worked with the showroom and were removed recently. Dharmendra is a garage owner.
 
 “The two former employees have confessed to their involvement in both the thefts. They told police the SUV stolen in December was sold to a man in Sitamarhi,” the SHO said and claimed raids were conducted to arrest the buyer, but in vain.
 
 Explaining their modus operandi, police said the sacked employees had earlier stolen away one of the two keys of the SUVs from the showroom, which they used to switch on the ignition of the vehicles to drive them out of the showroom.
