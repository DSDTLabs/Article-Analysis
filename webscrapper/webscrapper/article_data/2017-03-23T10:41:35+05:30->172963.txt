KOCHI: The crime branch team probing the death of   Shaji Varghese found that Cronin Alexander, who is accused of abetting her suicide, had asked her not to talk with other male friends. Sources said that Mishel's friend Christy had given a statement that Cronin had called and threatened him twice. 

 Cronin had also sought the details of other boys known to Mishel. Sources added that the incident happened when the youth was studying at an entrance coaching centre in Kottayam with Mishel.
 
 Earlier, a friend at her hostel had given statements that Cronin used to continuously pester Mishel and one of them had seen him slapping her. Since there are no major leads, the team is on the lookout for people who might have seen her jumping off the second  .
 
 The team had quizzed  , who had seen a woman resembling Mishel's description at Goshree Bridge on the very night of the incident. But, investigators are yet to get another witness to corroborate his statement. They are yet to confirm whether the girl he saw and the one seen in   footage is Mishel. Police are now considering the possibility of tracing her location by verifying the mobile tower details.
 
 On Tuesday, the investigation team inspected a private firm where Cronin had been working. The inspection was done after he claimed that he was in Chhattisgarh on the day Mishel went missing. Officers examined the computer used by Cronin and collected details.
 
 Sources close to Mishel's family said that the storyline based on CCTV footages and the witness at the bridge does not hold water since there was no one to back Wilfred's statement. Father Eliyas, a priest close to Mishel's family, said that Wilfred was not sure whether he saw Mishel on the bridge. "I talked to him last week. He was unsure whether the apparel worn by that women resembled the one worn by Mishel. The girl he saw didn't have a bag and her hair was untied. It doesn't seem like Mishel," he said.
