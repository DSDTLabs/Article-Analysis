MEERUT: A pall of gloom has descended on Meerut’s   village. Hundreds of households here are mourning the murder of  , a 28-year-old Dalit youth whose name was first put on top of a “list of violent protesters during the Bharat Bandh” compiled allegedly by some upper caste men and then shot dead two days later.

 Nobody knows who exactly prepared that list but local Dalits said some sections “outside the SC fold” were uncomfortable with Parya’s growing clout in the region.
 
 They claimed he was killed in retaliation “because the upper caste people wanted to send out a strong message”. Other Dalit youths named in the list — which was also handed over to the local police — are on the run fearing similar attacks.
 
 The youth who haven’t fled the village said they will celebrate   on April 14 “to keep alive the spirit of resistance”.
 
 Ashok Kumar, a 41-yearold resident of Shobhapur, told TOI, “With Gopi's demise and our children in hiding, April 14 will not the same this time. But not celebrating it will be seen as another victory by upper caste in the village. We will not let that happen.”
