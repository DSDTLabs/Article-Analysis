BENGALURU: The   on Thursday remanded four accused in the murder case of   in seven-day custody of   (NIA).

 Special judge for NIA cases   allowed an application filed by NIA seeking the custody of Waseem Ahmed, Mujeeb, Sadiq and Irfan Pasha. The NIA had sought their custody citing that certain new facts need to be ascertained by way of custodial interrogation.
 
 P Prasanna Kumar, special public prosecutor for NIA, told the court that the interim order of restraint passed by the high court is only in respect of accused number 5, Asim Sharif, and not against all the accused.
 
 Meanwhile, the high court adjourned to February 23 the hearing on the petition filed by the four, challenging the case and also the suo-motu takeover of the same by the NIA.
 
 The petitionersâ€™ counsel argued that the special court did not consider the relief granted by the high court to Popular Front of India (PFI) leader Asim Sharif in the same case recently and passed an order remanding these four to NIA custody.
 
 The main contention was that the Centre has gone beyond the law, referring the matter to the NIA suo-moto without there being any cogent material as well as any request from the Karnataka government. 
 
 Rudresh was hacked to death by two men on a motorbike in broad daylight in the Shivajinagar area of Bengaluru on October 16 last year.
