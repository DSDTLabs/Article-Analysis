After discussing the murder of the saffron activist in Surathkal, they planned to eliminate a person from the minority community to avenge the murder. Sources added that the other accused, including Anup, who was released a few days earlier, had met undertrials the same evening in jail to discuss who to kill.
 
 “The gang insisted the murder should take place between Surathkal and Kottara Chowki. During the discussion they zeroed in Basheer who they knew as they often visited his eatery,” the police officer added.
