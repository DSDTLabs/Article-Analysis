JALANDHAR: After writing off some farm loans,   chief minister   would now launch a   scheme for economically weaker members of the scheduled castes and backward classes during a state-level function being held to mark the birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar on April 14.

 Giving details,   deputy commissioner   said during the function, the CM would launch the scheme to waive off loans up to Rs 50,000 each, taken from the Punjab Scheduled Castes Land Development and Finance Corporation (PSCLDFC) and Punjab Backward Classes Land Development and Finance Corporation (PBCLDFC), by handing over cheques to eligible beneficiaries. He said in the function the beneficiaries from the entire Doaba region would take part.
