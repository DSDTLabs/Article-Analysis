MUMBAI: Resident collector, Mumbai suburbs,   has recommended action against civic officials for allowing industrial land owned by L&T at Powai to be converted to residential use and an IT park. 

 In his report submitted to Nitin Kareer, principal secretary, urban development department in October last year, Mahajan stated, "For granting permission for construction without obtaining No Objection Certificate from the government, it would be appropriate to take a decision under the Maharashtra Regional Town Planning Act."
 
 While Ranjit Patil, minister of state for urban development, had assured the legislative assembly in December 2017 that an FIR would be lodged, it has not been done. Urban development department officials said the matter is now pending before the chief minister. 
  
 "The   without obtaining a prior No Objection Certificate from the collector's office (urban land ceiling department) allowed 4,30,540 square feet to be used for IT park and another 8,37,200 sq feet to be converted from industrial to residential. On this parcel of land, 16 residential buildings have been sanctioned of which eight have been constructed and, for the remaining, the industrial buildings have been demolished," states the report.
 
  Following the "violation", the ULC department had issued a stop work notice. This was lifted in June last year following a high court order. At the same time the court allowed the collector's office to take appropriate action for any irregularity. 
 
 In November, the collector's office informed the state urban development department that as per section 20 of the ULC Act and a 2007 government decision, for change to IT park and from industrial to residential, the government must recover the cost of the vacant land at 100% of the Ready Reckoner Rate.
 
  Naseem Khan, who has been following up the issue on loss of revenue to the government, said granting   for this single change of user would earn the government approximately Rs 1,000 crore.
