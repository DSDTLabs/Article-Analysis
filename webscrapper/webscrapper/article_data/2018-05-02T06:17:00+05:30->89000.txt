NOIDA: With improved pass percentages in the Class XII  ,   and   have jumped 24 and 23 spots in the state-level ranking, respectively. However, the districts have failed to produce any top 10 rank holders.

 While Ghaziabad ranks third in performance in intermediate exams, up from 26th rank last year, Gautam   ranks 6th among all the districts of the state, according to a table prepared by the UP Madhyamik Shiksha Board.
 
 Last year, Gautam Budh Nagar’s pass percentage placed it on 30th rank. While Lucknow holds first rank in the list of 75 districts, the second is held by Amroha. The districts have bucked the state-level trend of lower pass percentage which was seen as a sign of curbs on mass cheating and stricter measures like installation of CCTV cameras.
 
 At the state level, the pass percentage for classes X and XII in 2017 was 81.18 and 82.62, respectively. This year’s pass percentage for both the classes — 75.16% and 72.43%, respectively — is lower than the figures for last year which was largely seen as a result of the strict measures introduced across UP.
 
 The overall pass percentage of students from Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar in both the classes is higher than the pass percentage at the state-level. While the pass percentage for Ghaziabad UP board students in intermediate is 90.82%, that of GB Nagar students is 87.40%.
 
 Similarly, the pass percentage of students of Ghaziabad in Class X is 89.60%, while that of Gautam Budh Nagar students in Class X is 81.5%.
 
 While officials attribute this improvement in performance to hard work by students and extra classes, they say that since the districts belong to the NCR region, which has better and more number of schools as compared to the other districts in central and eastern UP, they should produce top 10 rank holders.
 
 District inspector of schools (DIOS)   told TOI that although, the results were encouraging and higher than expectations, they will analyse and notify schools which have registered lower pass percentages.
 
 “With the situation of NCR, Noida-Ghaziabad should produce toppers too but the districts have failed to produce any rank holder,” an education department official said.
 
 In Gautam Budh Nagar, as many as 16,967 students out of the total 20,741 registered for the Class X exams had appeared this year. In Class XII, 13,555 students out of a total of 16,381 registered had appeared in the exams.
 
 In Ghaziabad, 27,843 students were registered for Class X exams out of whom, 25,992 had appeared. In Class XII, 23,445 students had registered themselves out of whom, 22,242 had appeared.
