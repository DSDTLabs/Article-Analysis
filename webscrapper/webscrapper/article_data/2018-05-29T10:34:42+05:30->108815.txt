NEW DELHI: Employees of public sector banks in all over India have announced to go on a two-day strike, on May 30 and May 31, to protest against a 'meagre' 2 percent salary hike.

 The strike has been called by the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), which is a parent body of bank unions, including National Confederation of Bank Employees (NCBE), All India Bank Officers' Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers Association (AIBOA) and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI).
 
 Earlier this month, the IBA had offered a raise of 2 percent over the total wage bill of the banks as on March 31, 2017, which was rejected by the Bank Unions. It also maintained that the negotiations on officers' demands would be restricted up to Scale III officers only.
 
 Emphasising more on several other demands, the unions have opposed IBAs delay in settling a charter of demands, government’s laid-back approach to wage revision for bank employees, a meagre offer of 2 percent hike in wage revision.
 
 The bank union has demanded a quick and early wage revision, suitable increase in salary and improvement in other service conditions and wage revision settlement to include all officers up to scale VII.
 
 Some others banks, such as  ,   and   (PSB), have also said that their functioning and services are likely to be impacted if the strike takes place.
 
 In the wage negotiation meeting held on May 5, 2018, IBA had proposed to offer 2 percent hike in the wage bill cost as on March 31, 2017. It also maintained that the negotiations on officer’s demands would be restricted up to scale III officers only.
 
 In the previous wage settlement, during the period of November 1, 2012 to October 31, 2017, IBA had offered a wage hike of 15 percent.
