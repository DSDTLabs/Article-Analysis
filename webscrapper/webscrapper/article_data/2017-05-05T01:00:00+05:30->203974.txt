  Priyadarshan, who was criticised for selecting Akshay Kumar as Best Actor and ignoring performances of actors like   (Dangal) and Manoj Bajpayee (Aligarh), said, "I promise we have done our best. Appreciation of cinema is always subjective. My film may not be good for you, your film may not be good for me. But when it comes to a jury, its decision is final and it has to be appreciated. The jury has done total justice and gave importance to the films which had social issues, projected our culture and beliefs. While analyzing a film, we look at how India was projected in it."

  Talking about his daughter's achievement and the controversy around her selection, Anil told us, "I know this 'deserving' argument. There have been times when I got an award and people said that someone else deserved it and sometimes even I thought so. But that's not the case with 'Neerja'. I can show this film to any director or producer in the world and he will also have the same opinion about the film and her."
