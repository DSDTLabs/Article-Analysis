RAJKOT: Two employees of a local angadia (courier) firm were robbed of cash and valuables worth Rs 26 lakh near Limda Chowk in the heart of the city late night on Monday.

 Babuji Vaghela and Haresh Patel, working with Akshar Angadia which has its office in Sorathiyawadi, were proceeding to Surat carrying cash, diamonds and jewellery. On reaching Limda Chowk, which is the centre point for private buses, two persons snatched the bag from Vaghela’s hands and fled.
 
 Patel had gone to get the ticket at the bus operator’s office while Vaghela was waiting near the bus with a bag full of valuables. “Someone pushed me from behind and I fell down. I got injured in the eye and lost grip over the bag. Before I could understand anything, two people snatched the bag and escaped on a motorcycle,” Vaghela told police in his statement.
 
 Except for a few packets of diamond, which were kept in their pockets, everything was looted. Eyewitness told police that the robbers went to Shashtri Maidan after snatching the bag where temporary GSRTC stand is functional and escaped from the other gate.
 
 V V Odedara, A-division police inspector, said, “We have taken CCTV footage from Sorathiyawadi from where they had started with valuables to come to Limda Chowk. We have also questioned nearly 10 persons who were involved in this kind of loot in the past.” 
 
 Police are not ruling out the possibility of some insider’s role in the loot.
