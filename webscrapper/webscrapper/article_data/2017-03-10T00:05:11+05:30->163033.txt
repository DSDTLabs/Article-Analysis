MUMBAI: Several villages in drought-prone districts like Aurangabad, Sangli, Satara, Dhule and Jalna are facing severe shortage of drinking water although intense summer is yet to set in. The situation in Nagpur region is alarming in view of the drastic reduction in water levels in important dams.

 A high-ranking bureaucrat confirmed to TOI that despite a good monsoon, the state water supply department had to deploy 77 tankers to meet the demand for drinking water in 82 villages and 62 hamlets.
 
 In 2016, the situation was grim and as many as 1,606 tankers had been pressed into service to 1,755 villages across the state. “We were expecting that in view of a good monsoon, we will not face shortage of potable water. We had planned to dispatch tankers in some villages in mid-May or in the first week of June. But now, the situation appears to be alarming since we had to deploy tankers from in the first week of March. We will require more tankers in April and May,” he said. “It is a disturbing situation. On one hand, the state government is unable to halt suicides in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions due to the agrarian crisis, on the other hand now many villages are facing acute shortage of drinking water,” the bureaucrat added. On the water level in dams, the bureaucrat said, the stock is better compared to previous years, but it is less than 50%. Last year, the water stock in 3,257 dams across the state was 20.56 per cent, while on March 9, it is 45.55%. In Amravati region, it is 44.05% against 18.54% last year, 46.7% in Marathawada region (2.11% in 2016), 28.34% in Nagpur region (17.39% in 2016).
 
 “Due to good rainfall and the completion of many irrigation projects, it was expected that till the water stock would be more than 50% at least till the end of March 31. Barring the Konkan region, the water stock in all the regions is less than 50%, in the Nagpur region it is 28.34%. 
 
 “It appears that the stock is reducing due to evaporation,” the bureaucrat said.
 
 “The Jalyukta Shivar campaign launched by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will help us tackle the agrarian crisis. We have set 2019 as the target to make the entire state drought-free. In view of the deepening of water streams, digging of farm ponds and construction of small dams, we will achieve the target,” he said.
