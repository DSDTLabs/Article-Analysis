AHMEDABAD: Sabarmati riverfront is considered a model in giving facelift to an ailing river. However, if figures of the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) submitted in Lok Sabha on January 5 are considered, Sabarmati is among Gujarat’s 20 most polluted rivers. Further,   ranks fourth among top five states with highly polluted rivers. 

 The MoEF claims Gujarat has 20 polluted rivers and streams, including big rivers like Sabarmati, Narmada and Mahi. Maharashtra is worse off with 49 polluted rivers. Next is Assam with 28 polluted rivers and Madhya Pradesh with 21 such rivers.
 
 According to MoEF data, the Union government has released over Rs 200 crore to curb pollution in Sabarmati and Mindola rivers. Mindola has its origin in Songadh taluka of Tapi district in the state. 
 
  
  
 This fund is the highest amount ever spent outside the Ganga river conservation project on which Uttar Pradesh has spent Rs 917.24 crore, West Bengal Rs 411.26 crore and Bihar Rs 216.46 crore.
 
 Experts believe industrial effluents is the most common reason for pollution of Gujarat’s rivers. Vadodara-based environmental activist, Rohit Prajapati, says that industrial effluents are being released in big rivers like Sabarmati, Mahi and Narmada without being treated. 
 
 “This also includes  ,” he said.
 
 “Moreover, big dams have been built on big rivers due to which the rivers are drying up and vanishing. The condition of rivers in Gujarat is going from bad to worse each passing day,” Prajapati said.
 
 Gujarart’s environment minister Jaydrathsinh Parmar could not be contacted for his comments on the issue despite several attempts.
