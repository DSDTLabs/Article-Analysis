Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has directed the government to get instructions from the Theni superintendent of police (SP) on a plea seeking police permission and protection for holding a protest against India-based neutrino observatory in Theni district. 

 R K Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran’s supporter Thanga Tamil Selvan filed the plea. According to the petitioner, Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) had decided to hold an agitation at Pottipuram in Theni to support the public voice against the installation of the neutrino observatory.
