PANAJI: After failing to nominate   and Mandrem beaches for the Blue Flag certification, the department of science, technology and environment ( ) has now zeroed in on   beach, following the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change’s (MoEFCC) request to identify a beach for clean-up and developmental activities.

 The DSTE had earlier received a proposal from the MoEFCC to nominate and shortlist a beach for the certification, with all expenses towards the same borne by the ministry under the integrated coastal zone management plan (ICZMP) for coastal states. 
 
 
  
 
 The state government would only have to allot a location suited to undertaking the project and provide necessary permissions for the same. As per the presentation forwarded by the MoEFCC, the certification will include and mandate issues with respect to solid waste management facilities, aesthetics, cleanliness, tourism and safety, etc.
 
 Initially, following Goa tourism development corporation’s (GTDC) recommendation, the   beach was proposed to be nominated for the certification. A meeting on the issue was also held at the Velsao-Pale village panchayat, where it met with opposition from the general public and local residents. Subsequently, the DSTE received a letter from GTDC wherein they proposed to nominate Mandrem beach in North Goa for the certification instead.
 
 Sources said that so far no beach in India has been awarded the certification. Obtaining one will surely help increase tourist footfalls in the state with increasing numbers of international travellers seeking to visit destinations with Blue Flag certifications.
