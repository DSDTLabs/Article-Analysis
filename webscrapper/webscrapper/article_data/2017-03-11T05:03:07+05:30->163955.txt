NEW DELHI: In what could spell bad news for this year's  , international weather agencies have begun predicting an   event in the second half of 2017. The latest update, from US state agency   and its funded institutions this week, gives a 50-55% chance of an El Nino forming from July onwards. 

 The indication comes on the back of similar computer-model forecasts released by the   as well as weather agencies of Australia, Europe and Japan over the past month or so. 
 
 El Nino is an abnormal warming of the ocean surface in central and eastern equatorial Pacific which alters weather patterns in many parts of the globe. In India, it's usually associated with weak monsoons. The last four El Nino events - in 2015, 2009, 2004 and 2002 - had led to poor monsoons and drought in the country.
 
 "There are increasing odds for El Nino toward the second half of 2017 (50-55% chance from approximately July-December," the update from NOAA's climate prediction centre said. Similarly, the   had in a report dated February 28 upgraded its outlook to El Nino 'watch', putting the likelihood of El Nino forming in 2017 at approximately 50%.
 
 However, these are early days yet for monsoon season projections. Climate-model forecasts for El Nino, or its mirror opposite La Nina, in February-April typically suffer from what meteorologists call the 'spring predictability barrier' - a lull in forecasting accuracy during this period."Our models do show increasing odds for an El Nino but we will get a better picture by April-May," said an   scientist.
 
 IMD's El Nino-La Nina update last month had given a more than 65% probability of neutral conditions continuing in the Pacific till around July. "There is increased probability of formation of El Nino conditions in the later part of the forecast period," it had said. The outlook also mentioned an increased possibility of a negative Indian Ocean Dipole, a particular difference in temperature at the two ends of Indian Ocean.
