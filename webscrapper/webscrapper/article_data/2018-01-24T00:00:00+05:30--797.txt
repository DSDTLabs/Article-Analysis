About his role, Sudeep has said, “We do our share of films as solo heroes during our career. Sometimes, when we are called in for a cameo, there is a certain plan or reason behind why you are required for that role. Once it was decided that I would do a cameo in this film, there were chances where the director, Naresh, could have gone overboard with the lines and written out something that was as heroic as those that might belong to a solo hero character in a film. I am pleased that he did no such thing. Instead, the lines he wrote for me were grounded and very simple. This simplicity and realistic approach to life and how we understand it is what the audience relates to.”
 Additionally, Sudeep has said, “I did not sign up for this film based on the character I got to play or for the story. I signed up because of the enthusiasm shared by the team. I responded to that energy. The trailer gives you an idea about the quality of the film. It is a visually-appealing film and I am happy and thankful to the team to have given me the opportunity to be a part of their film.”
