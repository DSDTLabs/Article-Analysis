NEW DELHI: While a few ‘violator departments’ have started shelling out their pending dues, threats of cutting   supply by   have largely failed to bring the non-paying departments in line. Almost three months after Delhi Jal Board — with a nod from the DJB chairman and CM   — had sent mass notices to 12 public departments to pay back over Rs 3,000 crore worth of pending water   and penalties, only three departments — north corporation, south corporation and BSES — have made some progress in clearing their dues.

 “North corporation has paid Rs 2.5 crore, south corporation has paid Rs 6.5 crore and BSES has submitted dues worth Rs 1.5 crore. These three have been the biggest contributors so far,” a senior official in DJB said, explaining the current status of recovery.
 
 While EDMC has acknowledged and approved a bill worth Rs 4.5 crore, they have claimed they are not in a position to pay their dues due to the ongoing financial crisis. “They have assured that whenever their finances get manageable, they will pay us back,” a DJB official said. 
 
 DJB officials said that while progress in the actual recovery might not be significant, the acknowledgements and letter exchanges about the pending dues have started with departments like DUSIB, DMRC, PWD and DDA.
 
 “There are 1,100 such consumers who have huge amounts of pending dues. In case of these 12 departments, even though the overall dues are worth Rs 3,000 crore, the original principal amount is Rs 737 crore, approximately. Even if we are able to recover the principal amount, this can bolster our coffers, opening way for large number of developmental projects,” an official explained.
 
 DJB has carried out actions based on these notices and 11 water   connections belonging to Delhi Police have been chopped off for non-payment of bills.
