MUMBAI: A cashier at Maharashtra Vidhan Bhavan was convicted and sentenced to five years' simple imprisonment for siphoning off Rs 63,000 from an MLC's medical claim and misappropriating over Rs 52.3 lakh from the state government funds-collectively Rs 53 lakh -in 2005. 

  On Wednesday, the 47th metropolitan magistrate A P Kulkarni ordered that the properties the accused, Manoj Gaonkar, had bought with the scam money-a flat in Chikoowadi in Borivli then valued at Rs 13 lakh, a flat in Mira Road then valued at Rs 4 lakh and a farm house in Talegaon in Pune then valued at Rs 3 lakh-be auctioned and the money credited to the state government. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on Gaonkar. 
 
  On March 15, 2005, the pay and accounts department of Mantralaya lodged a police complaint after an audit found that Gaonkar had deposited only Rs 7,000 in the state government's account in the RBI but submitted a forged receipt showing he had deposited Rs 70,000 and even produced a cash book. Assistant commissioner of police Phoolsingh Pawar said the money belonged to MLC Anil Gote's medical entitlement, an accused in the 2005 Telgi fake stamp paper scam. After Gote's arrest in the scam, his MLC funds were to be returned to the government treasury. 
 
 "The RBI receipt was stamped, but during investigation, it transpired that Gaonkar had deposited only Rs 7,000. He later added a zero to make it Rs 70,000," said Pawar. "When he was caught, he agreed to return the balance Rs 63,000. But the Opposition created an uproar in the legislative assembly over the issue and the Speaker decided to register an offence of cheating and forgery. The case was later transferred to the economic offences wing," he added.
 
  During the same period, a departmental inquiry was initiated against Gaonkar and it was found that he had misappropriated another Rs 52.3 lakh, including Rs 10 lakh from the Rs 30 lakh that Parliament had given the state government for a conference. Gaonkar was subsequently arrested in 2005 and the 3,500-page chargesheet stated that he had bought several properties with the misappropriated funds. He was booked under   sections 408,409, 468, 471 for criminal breach of trust, forgery and using forged papers as geniune.
