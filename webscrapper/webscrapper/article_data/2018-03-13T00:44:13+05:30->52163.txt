Pune: Sunil Deodhar, who played a key role in BJP’s win in   election, on Monday said that his party unit in the state will stop recruiting workers from other parties in a bid to prevent “goondaism by workers from other parties using BJP’s banner”.

 Deodhar, who is BJP’s Tripura in-charge, condemned the demolition of Lenin’s statue. He was speaking at the meet-the-press event organised by the Pune Union of Working Journalists.
 
 “We have come to know that some Communist party workers are perpetrating violence wearing T-shirts with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s photographs. They are doing it to scare people. We want to stop political goondaism in the state so we have decided to stop recruitment of party cadres,” said Deodhar.
 
 He said that embargo on recruitment of workers from other parties in BJP’s Tripura unit will be effective for six months. 
 
 Asked about demolition of Lenin’s statue allegedly carried out by   workers, Deodhar said, “BJP is more concerned about those alive than statues and wants to promote development agenda in the state”.
 
 “We will build only one statue in Tripura and it will be of Maharaj Bir Bikram Kishore Manikya Bahadur. It will be installed at Agartala airport,” he said.
