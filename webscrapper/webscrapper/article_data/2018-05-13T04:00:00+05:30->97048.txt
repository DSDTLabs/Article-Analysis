Ahmedabad: The Admission Commission for Profession Courses has extended the last date for online registration for engineering and pharmacy courses from May 14 to May 28.

 There are 66,059 engineering and pharmacy seats at 141 colleges in the state. The ACPC has also changed the schedule and decided that the academic year for colleges will begin on July 16. 
 
 Officials said that the last date was extended as the CBSE class XII science result has not been declared and there is no clarity about when it will be declared.
 
 Officials added that the merit list, which was to be declared on May 30, will now be declared on June 7. The first round of allocation of seats will be held between June 15 and June 19. 
 
 Online registration opened on April 26 with the aim of finishing the admissions procedure on time.
 
 Officials said that while the Gujarat board results are out, only 31,000 students have registered so far. A total of 39,000 PINs, which is needed to register online registration have been distributed. 
 
 Officials said the HSC science results indicate that half the engineering colleges in the state will not find students for their Bachelor of Engineering courses. Against 66,059 seats, only 44, 545 students cleared the Gujarat board HSC science examination with mathematics among their main subjects. 
 
 How many CBSE students are eligible for admission remains to be seen.
