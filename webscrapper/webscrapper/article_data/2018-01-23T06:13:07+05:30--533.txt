THANE: The Thane district administration is planning to bring the picturesque   on the world map by constructing an 18m-long transparent walkway over the 700mdeep valley. The project can be completed within three years once it secures approvals and gets budgetary sanctions.

 The proposal, which could possibly be the first of its kind in the country, involves developing a two-storey structure on a cliff near the   at   along the  . An 18m-long U-shaped pathway with transparent flooring material will jut out of the mountain rim, giving visitors a thrilling experience akin to ‘walking in the air’ over a deep gorge. There will be ample scope for getting breathtaking views of the ravine; clicking pictures will be possible on the deck.
 
 The plan is for the national highways division of the public works department to construct the structure in two stages. The first will entail developing the skeletal structure while the next phase will include developing attractions like an art gallery, amphitheater, and musical fountains.
 
 
  
 
 The walkway was proposed by   and supported by Thane’s guardian minister  . “The proposal has been approved (by the district administration) and is likely to bring Malshej into the limelight. There is tourism potential all 12 months of the year here. This new initiative will not only add revenue to the district, but also give revelers a world-standard tourist spot,” said Kathore.
