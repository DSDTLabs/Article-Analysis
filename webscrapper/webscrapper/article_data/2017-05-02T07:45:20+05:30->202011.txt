NAINITAL: The Uttarakhand   on Monday lifted the stay on appointment on   in the high court and ordered a single judge bench to dispose of the matter at the earliest.
  
  The court had last month stayed appointments of advocates on vacant positions after a petition alleged that the posts were being filled by favouring elected candidates.
  
  Petitioner  , a practising HC lawyer, stated in the petition that legal key appointments in the high court should be done according to apex courtâ€™s guidelines, which makes it categorical that the chief justice of the high court concerned should be consulted in such matters.
  
  After the exit of the   government, a number of officials, including former advocate general V B S Negi, who were appointed by the   to the high court tendered their resignations.
  
  According to sources, almost 80 officials appointed by the Congress government would also be on their way out shortly.
