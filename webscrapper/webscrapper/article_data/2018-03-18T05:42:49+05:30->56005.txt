CHANDIGARH: In a bid to contain revolt in the party's   unit over Delhi chief minister Arvind  's controversial apology to SAD MLA  , the Aam Aadmi Party's central leadership has called Punjab leaders and MLAs for a meeting in New Delhi on Sunday. 

 However, most of the MLAs, including leader of opposition   have chosen to stay away from the meeting.
 
 "I am not going to Delhi tomorrow for the meeting. I can't say about others, but think most of them will not attend the meeting tomorrow," Khaira told TOI.
 
 However,  , the co-president of the Punjab unit who quit from his post on Friday, said, "The MLAs have received mobile SMSs regarding the Sunday meeting in New Delhi at 5 pm. I am going for the meeting." The Punjab AAP leaders are in favour of meeting Kejriwal in Chandigarh, not in New Delhi. On Friday, party MLA   had said that the Delhi leaders would have to come to Chandigarh to meet the angry Punjab leaders.
 
 Earlier in the day, two senior Punjab AAP MLAs advocated for autonomous functioning of the Punjab unit.
