Panaji: Robust infrastructure, reliable internet, consistent power and ease of doing business are key to attract and develop an information and technology industry, the Goa Technology Association said. 

 The newly formed organization plans to work with the state government to aid more technology companies to set up shop in Goa, its secretary, Jervis Pereira, said.
 
 Given that the government introduced and notified the Goa IT Investment Policy 2015, Goa Technology Association plans to work with the Manohar Parrikar-led government to help ensure that the policy is efficiently implemented and that the policy’s incentives reach beneficiaries.
 
 While the Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI), and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) already have representatives from the IT sector, Goa Technology Association is the first exclusive body formed in Goa that aims to represent firms that leverage IT, including startups.
 
 “The association has one unique advantage over older bodies; it comprises business owners exclusively. Given this approach, GTA was quickly able to assimilate the IT business community that was not part of earlier organisations,” Pereira said while explaining the rationale behind forming a new industry body.
 
 The association has already begun to coordinate with NASSCOM to try and promote the IT sector in Goa.
 
 “Goa can emerge as one of the global leaders in multiple green technology disciplines. Design, cyber security and fin-tech are just some of the areas we can become a centre of excellence in,” Pereira said.
 
 Chief executive officer and co-founder of Umang Software Technologies, Mangirish Salelkar, has been elected as the president of the association.
