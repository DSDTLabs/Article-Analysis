GURUGRAM: The road repair work in Sector 40 has done more damage than good to residents. 

 Digging up of the road began on Sunday after PWD minister   inaugurated the work. According to the residents, as a result of the digging, six sewer lines were broken on Monday. Initially, the contractor tried to fix the sewer lines, but later left it unattended. 
 
 "We welcome the corporation's move to build a cemented road here, but that shouldn't be at the cost of our health. The stench is unbearable and mosquitoes are breeding on this water," said  , ex-RWA president. 
 
 The residents, however, claimed that they approached MCG official a number of times in the past three-four days but didn't not get a fitting reply. "We called the helpline number and also spoke to the junior engineer. We also tried connecting to the joint commissioner but we nobody has paid heed to the sewage mess created by the construction work, " said  , a senior software consultant living in the area. 
 
 Several alleged that despite having cars at home they are relying on cab services as the road in front of their house has been dug up. 
 
 "No work has taken place on this stretch since last Monday. We are not against the repair but work should be done at a fast pace," said  , a doctor living in the area.
