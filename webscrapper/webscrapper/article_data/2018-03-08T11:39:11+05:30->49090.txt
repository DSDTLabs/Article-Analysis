JAIPUR: More than 200 women from the Jhunjhunu district who underwent sterilization after the birth of daughters will get a chance to meet   Narendra Modi on Thursday.

 In a district which was once known for its skewed sex ratio, this trend is a welcome and much-appreciated change. Several of these women belong to the rural areas, who claim that though slowly, the mindset is changing even in the villages.
 
 These women gathered at department of women and child development office in Jhunjhunu on Wednesday afternoon to prepare for the meeting.
 
 Twenty-five- year old Manju said, "I have two daughters and now I have opted for permanent family planning method. I do not want more children. I will give better education to my children."
 
 She was among the women, who were invited by the WCD department. She belongs to Hirwa village in   district.
 
 An ASHA worker Babita of Sangsi village of   in Jhunjhunu district becomes source of inspiration for others. She has two daughters - one is doing MBBS and other is studying in class XI. "Long time back, I opted for sterilisation after two daughters. Now, when I go to meet pregnant women for their health monitoring, I inspire them by giving my own example that girls are not less than boys in any way," she said. 
 
  same village, who is just 24, have also decided not to conceive again as she has two daughters already. "My husband and I both decided not to have more children now. We are a happy family," said Pooja. 
 
 Sunita, who has completed her MSc and BEd, also decided not to conceive again. She is resident of Bhudki of Udaipurwati. "I do not know why people want a baby boy. But, slowly mindset is changing. People are talking about equal rights to boys and girls. I think it is not wise to add more children to the family in want of a boy. In our village, you would find women who have only daughters and they are happy. The change is happening because people are not becoming more aware," she said.
