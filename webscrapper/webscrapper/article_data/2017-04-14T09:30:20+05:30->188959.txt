INDORE: Amid confusion over use of   books, district collector P Narahari has asked all   schools in the city to strictly comply with the CBSE's directive of sending indent for NCERT books. 

 The order from district collector stated that schools not complying with the board's order will have to face disciplinary action.
 
 "The schools were informed by the board to send an online indent for the requirement of NCERT books. Those schools that have not submitted the online indent are ordered to get the NCERT books from local vendors or NCERT accredited vendors," stated the order by the collector.
 
 "The schools are asked to follow the directives of the board and inform about the use and availability of NCERT books class wise in each school. School if found disobeying the orders or using books from private publishers in the curriculum will be facing strict disciplinary action," the order stated.
 
 According to the collectors order, the schools have been asked to submit the details to the block resource officers within three days.
 
 On the other hand, the   has approached the board informing the officials about the reason of not being able to make the online indent for NCERT books.
 
 The letter from the schools to the CBSE officials stated that, the state government does not allow the schools to sell the books from the school. The schools can only prescribe the books and thus they did not make the online indent.
 
 "We have written to the board and it is very clear that the schools have already started with the new academic sessions and books have been already purchased by the parents. Though I haven't seen the order from the collector but we will be informing about our situation to the education department if required," said Manoj Bajpai, chairman,   of CBSE Schools.
