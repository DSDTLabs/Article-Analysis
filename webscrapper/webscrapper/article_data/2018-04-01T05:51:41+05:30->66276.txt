We have been subsidising the autonomous colleges by using funds from non-autonomous colleges. While we collect only Rs 65 per paper for examinations, autonomous colleges collect Rs 150. UGC also gives funds to autonomous colleges for conducting examinations,” he said, justifying the levy. An MOU has been signed with   for the purpose, he added.
