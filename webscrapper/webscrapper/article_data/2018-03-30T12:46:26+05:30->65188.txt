RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh high court has upheld the permission granted by the state pollution control board to establish a common bio-medical waste treatment facility near Siltara on the outskirts of Raipur city, describing it as in accordance of law. 

 Dismissing a writ petition filed by   limited, a company which is running a bio-medical waste treatment plant at Bhilai, the bench of Justice   held that the consent granted by state pollution control board to two other firms for establishing   (CBWTF) for capacity of two ton per day at Siltara near the state capital is in accordance of law. 
 
 Challenging the consent granted for setting of CBWTF, the petitioners said they have established CBWTF for Raipur, Durg and Bhilai, making its capital investment on land allotted to the petitioner in industrial estate on payment of premium and ground rent, and pursuant to selection and allotment of CBWTF, the company was granted provisional authorisation of a specific area prescription of Raipur, Durg and Bhilai cities. 
 
 The authorisation was kept on renewing and latest authorisation is valid up to 6-4-2018 in which the petitioner has made huge capital investment as per the guidelines of   and also made huge investment for upgradation as per the directions issued from time to time. 
 
 The main ground raised in the petition is that the guidelines, issued by Central Pollution Control Board, clearly bar installation of second CBWTF in the same area until the minimum bed capacity of 10,000 is achieved as it further prescribes the area restriction for second CBWTF. The petitioners contended that thus the permission granted was in violation of mandatory norms of the Central Pollution Control Board hence illegal and without authority of law. CBWTF is a public utility and as such, a private entrepreneur cannot be granted permission by mere asking, they argued. 
 
 The High court, in its order, held that the consent to establish bio waste treatment plant at Siltara granted after following the rules and procedures and it cannot be it cannot be held that such permission could not have been granted without open and transparent selection of eligible agency.
