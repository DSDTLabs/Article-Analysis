HYDERABAD: About 82 percent polling was registered in the MLC election to the Mahbubnagar-Ranga Reddy-Hyderabad teachers constituency on Sunday. A total of 12 candidates are in the fray for the seat. Counting of votes is scheduled for March 22. 

 "We have used web casting and monitored the polling process from   indoor stadium. Two video cameramen were posted at each polling station. The polling went off smoothly, " said election observer Rajat Kumar.
 
 He visited many polling stations in the city. Ballot boxes from Mahbubnagar, Wanaparthy, Gadwal, Nagarkurnool, Rangareddy, Medchal, and Hyderabad will be shifted to   stadium under tight security.
 
 Polling was originally scheduled for March 9. But it was cancelled and a repoll was announced due to the swapping of photographs of candidates on the ballot paper. It turned out that one of the contestants found the swapped pictures of two independent candidates on the ballot paper. The error was brought to the notice of the Election Commission.
