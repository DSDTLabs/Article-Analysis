LUCKNOW:  , nephew of   minister  , joined the   on Saturday. Soon after, Pramod accused ruling BJP of having betrayed the backward communities and alleged that his uncle was also being sidelined in the government and he too might quit the BJP and join SP in the near future if this continued. 

 Pramod's association can yield dividends to the SP in the upcoming Phulpur Lok Sabha bypoll which has been necessitated after the resignation of Keshav Prasad  , who is now deputy CM. Mauryas, along with other backward castes, have a significant presence in the constituency.
 
 Welcoming him into the party, party's national president   said that it was heartening to see young people from other parties joining SP. "This is indicative of the long association that we will have in our political careers," he said. Attacking the BJP,   said the ruling party and the government have not only neglected the Maurya community and backward castes but have also taken farmers unemployed youths for a ride with false promises.
 
 Taking a dig at Centre's 'Digital India' push, Akhilesh said the   fraud has proved that all the talk of checking corruption through demonetization was baseless.
