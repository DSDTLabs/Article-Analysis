MALAPPURAM: The   in the byelection in  , who had said on Saturday that if elected, he will ensure   at clean and modernized abattoirs in the constituency, issued clarifications on Sunday as controversy erupted over his statement.

 He said his emphasis was on setting up clean abattoirs across the constituency and that he made his statement in reply to a question over the recent government action against abattoirs in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 “My point was about the necessity of establishing clean and modernized abattoirs, not about beef. Answering a question about the closure of abattoirs in UP, I replied that I will ensure the distribution of good-quality beef at clean abattoirs if I am voted to power. There was no need to create a controversy over my statement. After all, it is not the job of an MP to supply beef. The media misrepresented my words with a hidden agenda,” he said.
 
 Sreeprakash’s statement made on Saturday had sparked outrage, especially in the social media. 
 
 During the press meet on Saturday he had also said that he will take steps to make beef available at affordable price. He had said that there was a hidden agenda behind the campaign against the BJP in the name of beef ban.
 
 “The BJP is not against any particular food item. The drive against the abattoirs in Uttar Pradesh was initiated because they were functioning without licence. The government can’t turn a blind eye to the demand to shutdown illegal abattoirs,” he had said. About the ban on cow slaughter in some states, he said there was no political agenda behind it. The ban was put in place considering the fact that it was against the religious beliefs of a major section of people living in these regions, he had said.
