CHENNAI: The city corporation is mulling a proposal to construct an indoor swimming   complex in a north Chennai neighbourhood under the Smart Cities Mission, with availability of space being the only constraint to the proposal.

 
 According to   sources, the proposal for a swimming pool complex was mooted during a recent smart cities discussion meeting.
 
 “We felt that the city’s north did not have a purposebuilt facility to nurture young swimmers. In the central region, the corporation maintains a pool at   and in the southern part of the city, the sports authority maintains the aquatic complex in Velachery,” said a corporation official.
 
 Zonal officers in   (Zone IV) and Royapuram (Zone V) have been asked to identify land parcels measuring at least five acres to set up the complex.
 
 “We are looking at sites in other zones too,” a senior corporation official said.
 
 With space being a big constraint, the corporation is as yet undecided on the size of the pool. “The idea is to have a 25m long pool. It is not an Olympic size pool (which is 50m long) but it would be an ideal choice for amateur and professional swimmers to test their skills. Once we identify the land, we would be able to plan design features for the indoor facility,” the senior official added.
 
 Barring the development of small-sized parks in north Chennai, the city corporation has done little else to add recreational spaces post expansion in 2011. A recent TOI article on the state of playgrounds in north Chennai exposed how these facilities suffer due to lack of maintenance and, as a result, lose out on patronage from residents.
 
 “It is good that the corporation is planning to set up a swimming pool in north Chennai. Most residents here travel to Marina Beach during May to take a dip in the pool. This is a welcome proposal,” said C  , a resident of Tondiarpet.
