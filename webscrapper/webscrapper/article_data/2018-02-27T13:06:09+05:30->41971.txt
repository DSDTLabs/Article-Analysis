PATNA: Chief minister   on Monday advocated for saving at least 10% of traditional system of learning in the fast-changing age of information technology. 

 “Today, world has gone far ahead in the field of information technology (IT). There is no coming back to the traditional system of learning. Still, we should protect at least 10% of the traditional system of learning like books and newspapers,” Nitish said after inaugurating the new campus of National Institute of Electronics and Information Technology ( ) at Amhara near Bihta in Patna district.
 
 CM said earlier people use to get knowledge through books. “Even today, we get lots of knowledge by reading newspapers. But now, the habit of reading books and writing on copies are vanishing. Today, we can get any information through the internet. But, I strongly feel we should save ourselves from being wholly dependent on technology,” he said.
 
 Highlighting the positive aspects of IT, CM said its use in government sector has brought transparency and made people-to-people communication easy. The use of technology has reached to such a pass that more than 8.5 crore people in   use mobile phones. 
 
 Recalling his presence at the stone-laying function for the NIELIT’s campus on July 3, 2013, Nitish thanked Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and his department for completing the project. 
 
 Earlier, Nitish and Prasad jointly inaugurated the new campus. Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, Union minister of state Ram Kripal Yadav and NIELIT’s director general   and state IT department’s secretary   were also present on the occasion. 
 
 The NIELIT campus has come up on 15 acres of land. The new campus would have linkages with other institutions in the state like IIT-Patna at Bihta and NIT-Patna for conducting graduate, postgraduate and doctorate level formal courses in electronics, computer science and information technology, a NIELIT official told TOI on Monday.
