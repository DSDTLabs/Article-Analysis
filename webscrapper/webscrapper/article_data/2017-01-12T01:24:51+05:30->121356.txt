INDORE: Less than a week after TOI reported that some farmers in Madhya Pradesh’s Sheopur district had received newly printed Rs 2000   with Mahatma Gandhi’s image missing, another case of misprinted currency notes came to light in   on Wednesday. This time, some   in Khargone district gave out 500-rupee notes which were blank on one side.

 Hemant Soni, a resident of Segaon village in Khargone district, said when he withdrew Rs 1,500 from a SBI ATM, he found that two of the 500-rupee currency notes were printed only on one side. “Only the side with Mahatma Gandhi’s image was printed. The other side was blank,” Soni told reporters. He immediately reported the matter to the bank, which replaced the notes. SBI’s Khargone currency chest incharge PS Panwar told TOI: “Around four misprinted currency notes with one side blank were received and replaced. We tried to ensure that the customers didn’t face any trouble.” He added that the matter has been reported to the RBI.
 
 Another incident was reported in Khargone city when one Gajendra Singh withdrew Rs 4,500 from an ATM in New Radhavallabh Market. “One of the Rs 500 notes was misprinted,” he said.
