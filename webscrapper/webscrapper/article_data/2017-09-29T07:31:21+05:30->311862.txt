VADODARA: Three days after they committed a sensational theft of Rs20.47 lakh in Gotri, the detection of crime branch (DCB) nabbed one of the accused from Gorwa on Wednesday night. Police said the accused duo had colluded with the van’s driver Vinod Bariya who too has been arrested. 

 The cops had suspected insider involvement soon after they began investigations in the case. “We had been working on CCTV footage and our informers. We got information that a man named Ajay Parmar, a resident of Refinery Road, was involved in the crime following which we nabbed him,” the police said. When questioned, Parmar admitted to his role in the theft. Parmar and his accomplice, Saiful Rana had planned the heist. Parmar said Bariya, who used to drive the van carrying the cash, had provided them information about the cash and the van’s movement to him and Rana. On Monday, Parmar and Rana followed the van that used to collect cash from petrol pumps and deposit in banks. “Bariya was in touch with the duo over phone. It was decided that Bariya would leave the van for a while so that Parmar and Rana could commit the theft,” the police added.
 
 As per the plan, when the cash custodian Sanjay Makwana went inside the petrol pump in Gotri to collect the cash, Bariya left the van under the pretext of checking air pressure in the tyres. Parmar and Rana came on a bike, picked up the bag full of cash and fled from the spot. When the cops asked about the stolen cash, Parmar told them that Rs14.75 lakh was kept in Hathidhar village in the outskirts of the city. It has been recovered by the cops. A local court remanded Parmar and Bariya to two days in police custody on Thursday. 
 
 Probe revealed that Bariya had to pay off his debts and hence hatched the plan. They were arrested for chain snatching in the city in 2012. “We are now trying to track down Rana,” said police
