KOCHI: The   (KMB) has been characterised by the  , loss,  , said eminent poet and critic  . 

 "There is a new artistic sensibility at work here. Art is growing more conceptual, emancipating itself from the idea that it is something that is fixed on the canvas into a larger space where it is in movement and flux," he said during his visit to KMB 2016 on Tuesday.
 
 He noted that curator Sudarshan Shetty had put together an "astonishingly diverse exhibition" that offered a multi-sensual experience wholly different from previous editions. The takeaway, for Satchidandan, was of the need to transcend the "morbidity of contemporary reality" in order to recreate a world of dreams that had been lost".
 
 "The exhibition is a reminder of what has happened to human beings, to objects, to nature, and also how the world could be better, more just, more beautiful if we would think and act differently," he said. From memories of Partition to witness accounts of the devastation of war and the "Sea of pain that life forces one to wade through", he noted the sense of tragedy and longing was counterbalanced by the narrative of togetherness-as represented by the coming together of peoples, perspectives and styles - in evoking the possibility of a kinder world. "So there is an emerging new aesthetics that is no longer confined to the eye . You hear sounds, you have works that appeal to nasal and tactile senses and also your intelligence," he said.
