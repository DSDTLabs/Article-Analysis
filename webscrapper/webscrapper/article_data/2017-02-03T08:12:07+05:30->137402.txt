PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The plea to save 199 trees on the stretch between Nigdi and Dehu Road has reached the doorstep of the Prime Minister.

 Nisarg Mitra Wing, a city-based group of environment activists, has written to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) requesting his intervention in the matter that is stranded between the ministries of environment and forests, defence and surface transport. 
 
 The letter was sent on the suggestion of PMO joint secretary Shrikar Pardeshi, who has earlier held the post of the municipal commissioner of  .
 
 In their letter, the activists have urged the PMO to consider their four-pronged proposal to save the old trees situated on NH4 starting from Nigdi Octroi Post till Dehu Road Y junction, on the way to   hill. “There is no end to development and infrastructure, but at the same time we consider that protection of the environment too is equally important,” Dhananjay Shedbale, one of the activists, stated in the letter.
 
 A response from the PMO is still awaited.
 
 Sharing details of their desperate attempt to save the trees, Shedbale said, “I first wrote an e-mail to Shrikar Pardeshi, with whom I interacted while he was posted in Pimpri Chinchwad. He responded quickly, suggesting that I write to the PMO, from where the issue can be raised with the ministries concerned. I hope there would be some relief soon.” 
 
 As of now, the road widening work on the stretch continues although the trees have so far been spared, ostensibly because of the timely intervention of the activists, who have now also taken up the issue of approvals and permissions granted for the road widening. 
 
 Elaborating on their struggle, Shedbale said, “We are in touch with the  , forest department, engineering consultants of   and the local police to identify the reasons for this road to be widened.”
