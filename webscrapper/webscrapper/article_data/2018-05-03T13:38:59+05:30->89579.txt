TRICHY: Former telecom minister A   has said he would not have survived the 2G case trial if the DMK and party president   had not stood with him.

 “If I had not been taught in the Dravidian movement, I would not have been alive after such a big case. I could succeed in the case as I approached it based on Dravidian principles. The DMK president stood with me throughout the trial,” Raja said while speaking at a function here on Tuesday night to review his book ‘2G Saga Unfolds.’
 
 He said the 2G case was a foisted one. “The Supreme Court had passed the judgment based on the report of the CAG without listening to me. The court had not asked us to express our side,” he said, adding that he had written the book to bring to light the problems faced by the DMK due to the case.
 
 He said that no one had challenged the contents in his book.
