MUMBAI: State-run   Hospital’s 400-odd resident doctors, who stayed away from work for three days to protest against an assault on colleagues by irate relatives, called off their strike on Tuesday evening after receiving a positive reaction from the state government about their security concerns.

 
 The state immediately inducted 28 security personnel and promised more after a review, started work on putting up 254 buzzers at 73 spots and promised to stringently observe entry of relatives into wards.
 
 “We felt   needs 282 guards but state officials explained the practical problems and have promised new guards in a phased manner over six months,’’ said Dr   from the Maharashtra Association of Residents’ Association (MARD). 
 
 Eight new spots got extra guards on Tuesday morning. The state will conduct a review by experts before increasing guards. “We appointed a consultant to guide us about the alarm system. 
 
 We have decided to get a wired system that requires civil work which will take time,’’ said minister for medical education  . 
 
 The state has promised 254 buzzers within two months. 
 
 “We will implement the pass system more stringently to prevent crowding in wards,’’ said JJ Hospital dean Dr S Nanandkar. 
 
 Three male relatives had entered a female ward and beat up Dr   and Dr   on Saturday. 
 
 “A male pushed our female resident against the wall, beat her on her abdomen and back after she fell down. She was severely traumatized,’’ the dean added. 
 
 Both doctors were discharged on Monday. MARD had wanted the government to ensure adequate stock of life-saving medicines so that relatives don’t need to rush out to purchase them at critical moments. “We have agreed to this and have made provisions for new residents to stay,’’ added the minister. He added that all resident doctors would be trained in grief counselling and communication.
