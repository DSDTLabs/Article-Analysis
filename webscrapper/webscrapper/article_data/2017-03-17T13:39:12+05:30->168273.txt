PANAJI: The   on Thursday passed the crucial floor test by winning 22 votes against 16 in the 40-member   assembly, with lone NCP legislator from Benaulim Churchill Alemao, supporting the regime and   Valpoi MLA Vishwajit Rane, leaving the House during the trust vote.

 The floor test was taken on the directions of the Supreme Court after Congress sought a stay on chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday.

 While the CM may retain home and finance ministries, Goa Forward Party MLA Vijai Sardesai is likely to get either the town and country planning or urban development.
 
 Revenue may be headed by independent MLA Rohan Khaunte, and art and culture ministry by independent legislator, Govind Gaude. 
 
 Maharashtra Gomantak Party MLA Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar is likely to hold the PWD and transport ministries again.
 
 Speaking to reporters after winning the trust vote, Parrikar said, “We have proved to the people of India that we have support, and we have proved it on the floor of the House. Everyone voluntarily came out and voted. None was kept secluded or in a hotel room, as was the case with the opposition.”
 
 Taking a jibe at AICC general secretary and Goa in-charge Digvijaya Singh, the CM said, “From the beginning, Congress did not have the numbers and was merely creating hype because there was a demand from within the party to have Digvijaya Singh step down. This happens when you come to Goa only to enjoy and not to work.”
 
 Election for the post of Speaker will be on March 22. Governor Mridula Sinha will address the assembly on March 23, a day before the budget, and the common minimum programme, the thrust of which will be on development, Goenkarponn -- or Goan identity -- and employment generation, will be finalized by April 14, Parrikar said, adding that his deputy will be appointed after a collective decision.
