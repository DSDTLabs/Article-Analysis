Still basking in the glory of his blockbuster production,  , Charan is in a happy space. And it seems to be having a trickle down effect in the   household as well. Even as the father-son duo were busy on the set of their film, a major renovation was underway at their residence. 'We are revamping our house after 15 years. Nannagaru has been thinking about this for some time now; more so ever since   became a part of our family, says Charan, adding, 'We are ensuring that there is an Indian touch in how the house is being redesigned. It's going to be very traditional ' nothing contemporary. We want to stay true to the roots.' 
So, what about speculation that all this is being done to welcome a new member of the family some time this year? (Laughs) 'Oh, I still feel like I'm a kid! When I feel grown up and when I'm sure that I can handle myself as an adult, I will think of children then. Right now, I have no such plans.'
