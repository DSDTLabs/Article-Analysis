PATNA: East Central Railway (ECR) general manager D K Gayen on Monday claimed that two alert railway staff – Manzoor Alam and Ramesh Prajapati – averted a major train accident near   under Sonepur division of the zone on Sunday night by spotting two big stone slabs on the railway track between Sathajagat and Dalsinghsarai (Up line) in Samastipur district. The Muzaffarpur-Bhagalpur Intercity Express (13420), which was to pass through the route, was detained for about two hours.

 Gayen said the track patrolling staff detected the stone slabs around 12.20am. “When they tried to remove them and clear the tracks for traffic movement, four miscreants, who were hiding in the nearby bush, suddenly appeared and prevented the railway staff from removing the stone slabs from the tracks,” Gayen said, adding the obstacles were kept on tracks to derail a passenger train.
 
 Sensing gravity of the situation, the railway staff immediately informed Dalsinghsarai RPF post and GRP station about the incident. The railway security personnel and GRP men rushed to the site along with engineering staff and repaired the track around 1.44am. The miscreants, however, escaped seeing the police, the GM said, adding the Railways would give a cash reward to the track patrolling staff at the ECR headquarters in Hajipur on Tuesday for averting a major mishap.
 
 “Railways is according top priority to passengers’ safety and track fitness in the wake of recent derailments of Indore-Patna Express and Sealdah-Ajmer Express near Kanpur. The ECR is following winter safety measures in all its five divisions as per the directive of the Railway Board,” he said.
