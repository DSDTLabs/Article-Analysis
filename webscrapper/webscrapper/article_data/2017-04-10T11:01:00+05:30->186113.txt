He also clarified that he never has debt up to Rs 3 crore. He urged his fans to watch the new show  , which will be aired on weekends on   channel. Pratham has now decided to spend some time in his home town  , where he will electrify houses in rural areas, from the money he got from the Bigg Boss show.
