DUBAI: Frenchman  , the second seed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships, powered into the quarterfinals, playing decisive tennis on the big points against Russian Karen Khachanov. Pouille then positioned himself strategically, having a go at the International Tennis Federation’s bid to shake-up the Davis Cup, the sport’s traditional team competition, calling the proposal a ‘death sentence’ of the annual event.

 
 Typically, reactions to the change in name and format were met with mixed reactions from the player fraternity, who have long swung between staying away and committing to the cause.
 
 Spaniard Roberto  , the third seed, who also made the quarterfinals here on Wednesday, advocated the idea of change. “Every new investment in tennis is welcome for us,” he said.
 
 The ITF’s move to make the event more attractive for the players by shrinking it into a seven-day feature, where the top 18 teams face off in November (the week of the Davis Cup final), rather than in four weekends across the year, robs some of the competition’s luster. The zonal groups will continue in the shortened format.
 
 The proposal, endorsed by the   board, will be submitted at the   in Florida in August, where it will require a two-third majority to come into play, possibly in 2019. The World Cup of Tennis has been floated by the ITF in partnership with Kosmos, founded by Spanish soccer star Gerard Pique and is reportedly worth $3 billion over 25 years.
