CHANDIGARH: As desired by the ministry of new and renewal energy ( ), the   will not be able to make the city 100%   powered by the year-end.

 The ministry had set December 31 as deadline for Chandigarh to become 100% renewable energy powered city. The electricity department of the administration has expressed its inability to make the city renewable energy powered in such a short span of time. The department is of view that making city 100% renewable energy powered can be achieved only in the long term.
 
 As the electricity department does not generate power, it purchases the required power from central generating stations, which include hydro, thermal and nuclear power stations. The department has long term purchase agreements with the power stations and must pay fixed charges to each generating station in addition to actual cost of power purchased.
 
 UT superintending engineer MP Singh said they have long term agreements with the power generating stations which cannot be cancelled that easily. If the contracts are cancelled, the department will have to sell out fixed charges of Rs 60 crore to non-renewable power plants.
 
 To meet the power demand, which hovers around 400 megawatt (MW), the electricity department purchases around 202 MW from hydro station, 80 MW from thermal power plants, while 10 MW is procured from nuclear power station. The electricity department has written to the power ministry to transfer the power quota, which it gets from non-renewable power stations to renewable power stations.
 
 The ministry had also directed administration to prepare a master plan for achieving the target of 100% renewable energy powered city, including solar wind, biomass and waste to energy projects.
 
 Chandigarh electricity department caters to more than 2 lakh consumers with an annual energy consumption of around 1600 million units (MU).
