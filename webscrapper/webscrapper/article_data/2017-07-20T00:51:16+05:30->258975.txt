Trichy: The teaching faculty at   ( ) have taken strong exception to the continuation of N Rajendran as the director in-charge of   (BSM) following his retirement as professor from the university.

 BSM was launched as the 18th school on the main campus of BDU exclusively for management studies in June 2016. Rajendran was appointed as the director in-charge (additional charge) of BSM on April 11, 2016. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Rajendran said that the teachers who are raising the issue now were silent when he was appointed in July 2016. “None had any issues then and the issue is being raised all of a sudden now,” he said, adding that he was given the responsibility based on his administrative skills 
 
 Rajendran added that the majority of the constituent colleges under BDU are run with in-charge principals who have retried as teachers from colleges. 
 
 As per the government order (GO 350), re-employment of a college teacher is not allowed beyond retirement at the age of 58 and university teacher at the age of 60. Rajendran retired as the chair of school of social sciences and head of department of history at BDU in June 2016 . 
 
 Sources from BDU said that a teacher’s body in BDU has raised the complaint with the registrar seeking his removal citing government norms. 
 
 “Several eyebrows were raised when N Rajendran was appointed as the director in-charge of newly launched BSM last year in the BDU premises. A quality person is required in the post of the director to sustain the academic credibility and integrity of the state run university,” said a senior faculty from BDU. 
 
 Asked on handling a management school with no prior experience or qualification in management, Rajendran said that he has been charged with only handling the administration of the school and not taking classes.
