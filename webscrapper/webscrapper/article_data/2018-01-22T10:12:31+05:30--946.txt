HYDERABAD:   minister of state for home   on Saturday night visited   (BJP) leader Nagam Janardhan   at his residence in Gachibowli over dinner and tried to pacify him to not quit the party to join Congress. 

 The Union minister had assured Reddy that he would be given a prominent role in the party and his fight to expose the irregularities and lapses in the TRS government projects would be taken up. The assurance was given after Reddy informed the minister that he is upset by the way in which BJP is not fighting against the corruption of   (TRS) despite the fact that he gave documentary evidence. 
 
 The miffed BJP leader told the minister that his party workers are in a state of depression as there are no definite signs of party winning any seats, or its growth in Telangana. The 70-year old Janardhan Reddy, who is a five-time   from Nagarkurnool, had joined BJP in 2013 after quitting Telugu Desam Party (TDP).
 
 When asked about the outcome of the meeting, Janardhan Reddy told TOI, "I will decide about continuing in the party only after March 19, after Ugadi. The decision will be taken in consultation with party workers and according to their aspirations."
 
 Sources said that Nagam informed the minister regarding the corrupt practices of the TRS government in the implementation of several projects in the state.
 
 "Though we have got documentary evidence, the issue of corruption in projects was not raised in the Assembly by the BJP. Some of the party leaders are rubbing shoulders with TRS. There is no point in continuing in the party if TRS is spared," Nagam Janardhan Reddy has reportedly told the minister at his residence.
 
 Meanwhile, Nagam has decided to meet governor E S L Narasimhan and explain him about corruption in Kaleswaram irrigation project.
