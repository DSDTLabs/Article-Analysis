LUCKNOW: Railways have sought funds to improve second entry at   out of rail budget 2017-18. The proposal for renovation and improvement of the rearside entry at the station has been sent to the Railway Board. Lucknow division has sought Rs 16 crore to upgrade passenger amenities at the second entry of the Charbagh station.

 Though there has been talk to revive alternate entry at Charbagh since 2008-09, it's the first time a proposal has been sent for its inclusion in the railway budget. “The proposal has been sent and if it gets a political push it may come through,“ said sources. The plan and estimates have been sent and now it is up to the ministry to decide whether it will be done through public private partnership (PPP) or get funded by rail ways. The second entry lies at the back of the station and allows direct entry from the VIP road. The second entrance will cut down congestion at the main entry to the station on   road.
 
 The second entry was designed about two decades back and is primitive in design and concept. It has ticket counters and a foot-over-bridge (FoB) to connect all platforms. The entry, however, misses on passenger amenities like waiting rooms, cloak room, toilets, drinking water facility and refreshment counter.
 
 “We propose to develop cir culating area and parking at the place,“ said Northern Railway divisional railway manager A K Lahoti. Since the land belongs to railways, development of the place might not take much time provided the proposal gets approved. Railways have discussed the development of second entry with state agencies quite a few times in the past.
 
 Being a collaborative effort, railways and LDA had also worked out the revenue-sharing model. The plan, as discussed was to construct a 250metre-long building, a shopping arcade in the centre, two developed entry and exit points. The plan, however, did not take off.
