PUNE:   were found dead outside a housing society in   on Saturday. One dog’s body was missing its head while the other is believed to have been poisoned. 

 The bodies were discovered by Amit Shah of Jeev Seva Foundation, who was passing through the area. “I was on my way to Bavdhan when I saw the  ,” said Shah. “It was a horrible sight, with blood oozing out from the neck. It appeared the dog was killed only a couple of hours previously,” said Shah.
 
 The body of the second dog just 20 feet ahead, with foam on its muzzle. Animal activists suspect  , because when they returned to the spot with the police, the two bodies had disappeared. Civic workers had removed the headless body, but the body of the poisoned dog could not be accounted for. 
 
 “We asked around, but nobody could had any information about the second body. The PMC had only taken away just the decapitated body,” Shah said. 
 
 As neither body was available, they could not lodge an FIR or even do a panchanama. “We cannot be sure whether the headless dog was the victim of an accident or foul play. Also, since the PMC had already buried the body, we did not think it right to exhume it for post-mortem. But the presence of the second dead dog, and its subsequent disappearance is cause for suspicion,” Shah said.
 
 Meanwhile, a police official from Chatushrungi police station, who had visited the spot, said it looked like the dog was decapitated after its head came under the tyre of a vehicle, going by the picture. “We could not do a panchanama as the body had already been picked up,” he said.
