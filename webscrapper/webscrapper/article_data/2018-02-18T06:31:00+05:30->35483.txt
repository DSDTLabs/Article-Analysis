NAGPUR: City police top brass has   eight  , including a driver, for helping a gangster while he was in Nagpur Central Jail. The suspension order was issued by DCP, headquarters,   after an inquiry by ACP, crime, Ashwini Patil.

 The personnel suspended have been identified as ASI Dashrath Dhurve, constables Ajay Neware, Suresh Bele, Munindra Bhange, Harshad Powale, Jayant Zade, and Manoj Kodape, and driver ASI Sanjay Thakur.

The escort cell, under in-charge CM Bahadure, is entrusted with the responsibility of ferrying convicts and under trials to-and-from Nagpur Central Jail.
 
 Sources from police department claimed the escort cell personnel had managed to misuse their clout to influence the duty allotment system, to ensure they were deployed whenever gangster Raju Bhadre was to be taken to hospital or court. Bhadre, who had got admitted at hospital repeatedly on some or the other pretext, would always get these cops as guards.
 
 Sources claimed that the gangster and other prison inmates would misuse the cell phones of the constables to make calls. An unconfirmed source said   would often make issue threats and make extortion calls using the copsâ€™ cell phones. Some calls were also made to persons in Mumbai. Some of these calls were reported to the cops, who traced these numbers to the erring constables.
 
 The constables would also allow the gangsters, especially Bhadre, to meet private persons during their duty hours in violation of norms. Bhadre, now shifted to Amravati Central Jail, would also be allowed several other privileges in exchange of money whenever these constables were on duty.
 
 It is not known whether any senior official too would be pulled up for the irregularities.
