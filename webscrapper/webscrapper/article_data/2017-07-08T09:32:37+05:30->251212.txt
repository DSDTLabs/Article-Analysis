BENGALURU: Was the clash between Metro employees and   (KSISF) personnel waiting to happen? According to sources in the   (BMRC) and KSISF, differences between the two sides have always been there, which blew up on Thursday.

 “Altercation between   is routine. While at some Metro stations, understanding between the two departments has been good, but not everywhere. Even at Central College station, Metro staff had reservations with the security personnel coming late to work despite repeated requests. KSISF personnel, on the other hand, allege that Metro employees don't cooperate with them in daily security checks,“ said a BMRC employee.
 
 “The protest on Thursday and Friday could have been avoided if the BMRC and KSISF had resolved their differences earlier,“ he added.
 
 Suryanarayana Murthy, vice president, BMRC employees union, accused the Metro management of not paying heed to the problems faced by its employees, and the frustration had been building among the workforce. “During Friday's meeting with the officials, we sought a robust   and that regular meetings be held to understand the staff problem,“ he said.
 
 
 
 
 BMRC employees say they work in three shifts -5 am to 2 pm; 2 pm to 10 pm; and 10 pm to 6 am. “In other industries, employees doing night shifts are given a special allowance.Why are we denied of it?
 
 We receive lesser salaries and facilities compared to other metros in the country,“ said Murthy.
 
 
 
 
 In response to a tweet by angry commuter, BMRC spokesperson U A Vasanth Rao said, “It's a stray incident and should not be generalized. Metro staffers have always been praised by commuters.“
