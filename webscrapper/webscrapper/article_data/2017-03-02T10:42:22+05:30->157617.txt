HYDERABAD: Srinivas Kuchibhotla's wife Sunayana on Monday urged the leaders of global tech industry to keep defending human rights as they too employ a large number of immigrants.
 
 “Thanks to people such as Satya Nadella (CEO-Microsoft) and   for supporting through your tweets. It means a lot to us. My sincere request to   (Facebook), Sundar Pichai (CEO-Google), Satya Nadella, and many others to keep advocating your support for human rights,“ she said in a Facebook post.
 
 “We need to spread love and stop this hatred. Today, it's an employee of  , tomorrow it could be one of your employees and I don't want anyone to go through what my family and household went through,“ she added.
 
 She also thanked the Telangana government for extending support to bring the body of Srinivas back home from the US.
 
 She further said: “I will now ask the same question -on what basis we decide a person is good or bad, and of course, it's not based on the colour of your skin. So what decides that? Many times these issues are talked about for a few weeks and people tend to forget about them after-ward, but the fight must go on towards eradicating hatred from the minds of people. So what is the government going to do to stop hate crime?"
