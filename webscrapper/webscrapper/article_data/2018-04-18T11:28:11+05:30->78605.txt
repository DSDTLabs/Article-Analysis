MADURAI: A case has been filed before the Madras high court   bench stating that a vacant land belonging to the Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) department situated near Arulmigu Subramaniaswamy temple in  , is being used as a burial ground and as a place for anti-social activities during night. Instead, the land could be used for welfare of the devotees coming to Tiruchendur, the plea said. 

 One S P Narayanan from Thiruchendur has filed the case. He said there are 30 acres of vacant land of the HR&CE. Earlier, the land was allowed for devotees who came during festival seasons, to take rest. 
 
 Now, in the recent past a part of the land has become a burial ground. Besides, anti-social activities have been taking place during nights. The bodies of people who committed suicide are buried illegally. The HR&CE could use the land for the welfare of devotees that is for extension of bus stand and vehicle parking. 
 
 Hence, it was necessary to issue a direction to the authorities to protect the land from using it as burial ground and to use the land for the welfare of devotees. Regarding that, a representation was also sent to the Tuticorin collector and HR&CE commissioner on June 29 last year. But, there was no response on it. 
 
 When the case came up for hearing before the division bench of justices C T Selvam and A M  , the bench adjourned the case.
