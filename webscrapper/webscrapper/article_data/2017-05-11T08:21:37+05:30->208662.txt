ALAPPUZHA: The special investigation, probing the murder of DFYI member Jishnu, submitted a 265-page chargesheet before the   first class magistrate court on Tuesday. Haripad CI   submitted the chargesheet 88 days after the murder. Police have already arrested 16 of the 17 persons named in the chargesheet.

 Sudheesh (29) Karuvatta – the prime accused who planned the murder – flew to the Middle East shortly after the murder. SIT has already issued a lookout notice at all airports to nab him. Jishnu (24) – DYFI’s joint secretary in Karuvatta – was hacked to death by a 14-member team led by Sudheesh on February 10, 2017. 
 
 The chargesheet stated that the murder was the result of clashes between two quotation gangs from Ottuparambu and Karuvatta. Jishnu was the leader of the gang from Ottuparambu and Sudheesh of the other. Two years ago, Jishnu and his gang had assaulted Arun (23) and Pradeep (24), who were members of the rival gang. On January 25, 2017, the gang led by one Sandeep (25) attacked Ullas (26) who belonged to the Karuvatta gang. Ullas, a close friend of Sudheesh, died on January 31. Sudheesh, who returned from the Gulf, blamed Jishnu for the murder and decided to kill Jishnu on February 10, the main festival day of Haripad Sree Subrahmanya temple. Jishnu was returning home with his brother Vishnu on a bike, closely followed by Sudheesh and his gang. On seeing them, Jishnu hid in the room of a nearby home, but was chased down and killed. 
 
  said that the 16 accused were remanded in judicial custody. “We seized 10 weapons (seven swords, two axes and iron rod) they used to kill Jishnu. We also seized seven bikes and a car. We recorded the statement of 154 witnesses and collected 245 documents. We also handed scientific evidence in court to prove the role of the accused,” he said.
