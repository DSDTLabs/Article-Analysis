SURAT: The visit of railway minister   to the city on Sunday has turned out to be a fruitful one. Western Railway (WR), which was delaying construction of prestressed concrete (PSC) slab to stop leakage from trains at   railway underbridge, has agreed to complete the work in three months’ time. 

 Not only this, the WR authorities have also agreed to approve design of railway over bridge (ROB), which will connect Sahara Darwaja and Bombay Market, to be submitted by the contractor of   at a meeting between top officials of SMC and WR general manager G C Agarwal on Sunday. Agarwal and senior WR officials from Mumbai had accompanied the railway minister to the city. 
 
 Thousands of commuters have been facing hardships since the past many years, while crossing Sahara Darwaja railway underpass. It is here, that the commuters have to stop when the trains pass because of filthy droppings from them. Every day, traffic comes to a grinding halt on both sides of Sahara Darwaja underpass as dozens of trains pass throughout the day and night from this track.
 
 “ live in Parvat Patai, which is on the other side of Sahara Darwaja underpass. I had a bad experience while on my motorcycle. I prefer travelling in my car now just to avoid the dirt. If Indian Railways has agreed to stop the leakage in three months, I am more than happy,” said  , a diamond trader. 
 
 SMC adviser   said, “The meeting with WR GM was successful and we have agreed upon many important issues concerning the city. We have also submitted a proposal to beautify all the railway underpasses falling under SMC jurisdiction.”
 
 Sources said WR and SMC have agreed to remove around 3,000 hutments located alongside the railway tracks. The civic body will soon come out with a detailed proposal on alternative housing under the EWS scheme for these slum dwellers.
