KOCHI: The vehicle movement on   road came to a standstill on Saturday evening with people thronging to watch stage show of A R Rahman at Irumbanam. As the parking space was situated far away from the venue, people had to walk long distances resulting in traffic chaos. The heavy rains which began around 4.30 pm, worsened the situation, forcing people to return home. As the rain continued, the show was cancelled. 

 
 "There was no one to guide people in the area though there was huge presence of police personnel. We booked tickets for the show paying Rs 2,000. As large number of people were moving in and out of the venue through a narrow road, it was difficult to move with our car," said Sabitha, who came to watch the show along with her son from Kollam. 
 
 Around 450 police personnel were deployed in the area. Pradeep, who lives near   had to depend on an ambulance vehicle to reach main road from the venue. "The traffic congestion on the Kakkanad- Tripunithura stretch started by 1.30 pm as people from across the state thronged to watch the show," said Pradeep.
 
 Rain also disrupted traffic on city roads on Saturday as water clogged several roads slowing  .
