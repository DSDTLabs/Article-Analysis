KOLAR: When the sky opened up on Tuesday, it wasn't just rainwater that came pouring down in Kolar. Massive hailstones accompanied the downpour, leaving   awestruck. For a district reeling under hydrological drought for a decade, the phenomenon was rare -witnessed after 60 years -and destructive. 

 The hailstones left a trail of devastation in the vicinity of Dommalur, causing major damage to standing crops. According to  , a farmer who owns two acres of land, rain lashed the village for almost two hours on Tuesday evening and was accompanied by huge hailstones. “We have not experienced so much rain in the recent past; it has damaged the carrot crop,“ said Purshottham.
 
 Not expecting the hailstones, the farmer had put up a net to protect the carrots from extreme heat. However, even the net couldn't withstand the heavy spell. Amar Shankar, secretary , gram panchayat, said protective nets were damaged in the fields of other farmers too. Even the neighbouring village of Baragur was at the receiving end of the rain fury , he added.
 
 According to Narayanaswamy , revenue inspector for Lakkur hobli, residents tried to preserve the hailstones but due to heat during the day , the water evaporated on Wednesday morning. Similar hailstones were witnessed six decades ago, recalled K Rathnamma, a resident.
