NAGPUR: The seven-year-old Maharajbagh zoo   continued to elude the cage on the third day too. The tigress is being shifted to   for mating with a male tiger named Sahebrao.

 Despite several efforts to lure the tigress, she did not enter the cage even on Monday. The officials chose Monday to try again since the zoo is closed and there is no disturbance of visitors, but the daylong efforts proved futile.
 
 Zoo officials, including zoo in charge Dr SS Bawaskar, said, “We had kept a live chicken inside the cage but Lee did not enter it, though she drank a bowl of milk which was kept at the edge of the cage. We also modified the cage but to no avail.”
 
 The zoo staff also used water hoses to force the tigress towards the cage but it didn’t enter it. Even loud noise by staff could not help. The zoo has sought help of   divisional manager   to provide additional staff to see that the animal enters the cage.
 
 “As it is not an emergency, we will not tranquillize the tigress,” Dr Bawaskar made it clear.
 
 Now, the plan is to serve food to Lee inside the cage, where it has to be moved to be shifted to Gorewada. The zoo staff expect hunger will certainly force the tigress into the cage in a few days.
