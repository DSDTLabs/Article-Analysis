£1,000 award supported by   and publisher   goes to Auld Lang Syne, which saw off a ‘startlingly strong shortlist’ 

  Lisa Smith’s short story about an elderly man behind bars on New Year’s Eve, with a subtle take on masculinity and ageing, has emerged winner of this year’s Guardian 4th Estate  .
 
  The story “Auld Lang Syne” by Smith won the award from a shortlist of six that was “startlingly strong”, according to judge and Gurdian books site editor Sian Cain. Cain told 
 , “A perfect example of what the short story can do when the form is at its best: containing as much of an emotional blow as that of a 800-page novel, regardless of its brevity.”
 
  The story is set in a Brixton police station as Rufus, the protagonist, is questioned about the fracas. Told with wit and grace, it deals with a complex situation unfolds that touches upon shame, fear, masculinity and ageing. Cain added, “It is a very confident story, in spite of its very difficult subject matter. It made all of the judges very excited to see what Lisa will write for her undoubtedly marvellous first book.”
 
  The BAME prize was set up in 2015 in response to the Writing the Future report, which suggested that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) writers struggled to get published and also against stereotypes imposed by the UK’s shockingly white publishing industry.
 
  Smith is awarded with a sum of £1,000 and a workshop with 4th Estate editorial, publicity and marketing teams.
