Natural star   and   are a cute pair onscreen. The duo have hit it right away ever since they starred in 'Gentleman', their first film together.

 When it was announced that Nani and Nivetha will collaborate for 'Ninnu Kori', fans couldn't handle the excitement and the movie, which was released recently, it went on to prove that the duo make an adorable onscreen couple.
 
 Now, sources are suggesting that they might come together once again for Nani's 21st outing, 'Krishnarjuna Yudham', under the direction of Merlapaka Gandhi. The title and first look of the poster of 'Krishnarjuna Yudham', which hints at Nani's dual role, after 'Jenda Pai Kapiraju and Gentleman' is released on July 15. 
 
 Most probably, Nivetha might be part of the project, which is still in the pre-production phase. The film is aimed for a theatrical release early 2018.
 
 Meanwhile, Nani is already shooting for 'Middle Class Abbayi (MCA)', being helmed by Venu Sriram.
