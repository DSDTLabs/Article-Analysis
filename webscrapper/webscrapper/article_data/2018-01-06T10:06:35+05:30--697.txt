NAGPUR:   was a saint in true sense of the term as he spent his lifetime for reforming society, using his words like a whip, prodding people not to believe in superstition, slaughter animals for performing rituals, take loans for celebrating festivals and keep away from addictions. 

 Inspired by his story, Kamgar va Sindhi Meghe Vasahat, Wardha, staged ‘Andhar Pahilela Manus’ at the 65th drama competition at Kamgar Kalyan Bhavan, Raghuji Nagar, on Thursday. The presentation stood to the expectations.
 
 Debuji Janorkar, who later came to be known as Gadgebaba as he used to carry with him a broken earthen pot, faced harsh realities of life when he lost his father when he was too young. He also saw how his maternal uncle could not bear the torture of a moneylender from whom he had taken loan on mortgage for performing marriages of his near and dear one. Gadgebaba could do nothing but to watch haplessly moneylender grab the land. 
 
 Societal ills opened the eyes of Gadgebaba and he decided to dedicate himself to root out all that was wrong. The play showcased how Gadgebaba created awareness among people through his kirtans, abhorring casteism.   and sant Kabir were his ideals.
 
 Gadgebaba was the champion of cleanliness and used to sweep the areas around him daily, the practice people followed. He wanted people to maintain high morals and rush to the help of the needy. 
 
 ‘Andhar Pahilela Manus’ did not lose the grip as the actors gave powerful performances. The play, directed by  , showed Gadgebaba’s resolute approach towards eliminating social ills for which he travelled extensively.
 
 He even ignored his wife’s repeated requests to accept different rituals and practices rampant that time in the name of God. 
 
 The play also depicted Maharashtrian culture with Vasudevs performing, Gondhal dance and Potraj who worshipped ‘Kadak Lakshmi’.
