NEW DELHI: The high court has told the   that while verifying date of sale of   two-wheelers prior to registration, it should take into account the dates of online payment of   or issuance of insurance certificate.The direction comes as a relief for the dealers who had sold BS-III two-wheelers before March 31, the deadline set by the   for sale and registration of such vehicles, but were not able to get them registered as the department was not accepting documents after the date set by the apex court.

 However, the direction would be applicable to only the `non self-registering dealers', who cannot make online payment of sales tax, the high court has clarified.
 
 Several such dealers had moved HC, saying the department was not considering the documents for registration and claimed that they have made the sale before the deadline.
 
 Around 1000 BS-III fuel twowheelers and commercial vehicles were awaiting registration.
 
 Justice  , before whom the plea was listed, asked the department to register the BS-III vehicles as per the the apex court's orders provided that the dealers gave requisite proof that the sale was made before March 31.
 
 The court told the department that while verifying the factum of sale, it “may take into account the online proof of payment of insurance premium or issuance of policy prior to the date of March 31, 2017“.
 
 It also said if the above two conditions are not met, then the motor licensing officer, who would verify the date of sale, cannot merely rely on the sale invoice provided by the dealer but would have to consider the tax payment receipts issued by statutory or regulatory bodies.
 
 The court also said the petitioner-dealers be allowed to present their vehicles for physical inspection till May 15.
