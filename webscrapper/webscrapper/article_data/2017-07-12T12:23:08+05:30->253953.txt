SURAT: Dipak Patel, son-in-law of  , 63, who was shot dead in the   on Monday, said “She was not prepared to go to Amarnath. Her friend from Navsari insisted to join the pilgrimage as one seat in the bus was empty. My mother-in-law was religious and wanted to go to   pilgrimage. We were shocked to hear from the authorities on Monday night that she was among the seven killed in the terrorist attack.”

 Patel added, “I was planning to go to Amarnath next year. Now, I want the central government to eliminate the terrorists from Jammu and Kashmir to allow the pilgrims to safely do the yatra and return. The government should give a befitting reply to the terror attack on the Amarnath pilgrims.”
 
 Suresh Patel, son of Lakshmiben, who died in the terror attack, said, “The government and political leaders should take strict actions instead of making statements. Those spreading terror should be taught lesson instead of just talking about it.” Lakshmiben and Lalliben Patel, both from Dasera Tekri in Valsad, had gone to Amarnath in the bus. Lalliben returned safely to her home while Lakshmiben died in the attack.
 
 Meena Khimani, 58, sister of Prakash Vajani who has suffered a bullet injury in the terrorist attack, said, “I was supposed to go with my brother and his family, but I left for the pilgrimage on July 3. I returned on July 9 after suffering breathing problem at the height. I was under shock to hear about the terrorist attack on the bus. Enough is enough and the government should act strictly against the terrorists. We need second surgical strike of a big nature to eliminate the terror groups.”
