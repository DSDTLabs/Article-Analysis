GUWAHATI: Bringing an end to 18-year-old  's   impasse, the education department has finally agreed to provide a scribe for the visually challenged Class X student this year. 

 An order issued by   district inspector of schools, MK Nath, has instructed that an amanuensis from Class IX will write in the board exams for Rupam. 
 
 He has also been given 60 additional minutes to complete his answer script for an examination of three hours and 40 additional minutes for an examination of two hours.
 
 Rupam has been unable to pass the board exam twice after he could not get a scribe due to red-tapism. Even his 100% disability could not satisfy officials on previous occasions. The office of the inspector of schools, however, took prompt initiative this time after his plight was published in TOI recently. 
 
 Rupam is overjoyed with this response, and thanked the Lakhimpur SP office, which took up the cudgels on his behalf. "I am studying hard for the sake of my family, which went through a lot of the troubles for me. I am grateful to SP sir and the inspector of schools of Lakhimpur for allowing me to take the help of a scribe," he said.
 
 His father   is confident about his son's performance ahead of the exam, commencing in mid-February. 
 
 "It was just impossible for Rupam to pass the Class X board exam without taking the help of a scribe. He failed on the previous two occasions mainly because his writing speed is very slow. Today, I am happy to see the promptness of the education authorities," said Deepak, who works at a bicycle store near Dhakuakhana.
 
 He made an appeal to the education department to chalk out a permanent solution for hundreds of students like Rupam, whose plight goes unnoticed.
