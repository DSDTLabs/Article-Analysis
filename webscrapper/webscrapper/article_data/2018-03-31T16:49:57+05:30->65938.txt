Keeping up with the festive spirit of the month, renowned socialite from the city Sunita Maheshwari organised an ethnic theme based get together for her friends and family. Though the theme was traditional attire in either   or orange, the ladies let their hair down and thoroughly enjoyed a song and dance session.
 
  
  “We kept colour code as yellow or orange not only because they are considered auspicious, but also because it marks the colour of the   months   and  . These months are widely celebrated in every community as heralding of new year and harvest. So we indulged in the vibrancy of these colours too!” shares Sunita.
  
  
 The ladies of this group started with a   party this month, and are starting a new trend of celebrating all community festivals with a new twist. 
  
  
 “We have decided to have parties centered around festivities of the every month, including special dishes had during that festival. Like this time we had a potluck of satvik dishes like bhandare wale  , bhajiyas, samosas and other sweets” shares Malvika
