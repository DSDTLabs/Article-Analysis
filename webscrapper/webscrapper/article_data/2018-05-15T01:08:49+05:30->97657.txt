New Delhi: Shouting slogans against their  , hundreds of street vendors and hawkers gathered outside lieutenant governor   office on Monday morning and demanded immediate halt of municipal actions against them under the SC-mandated anti-encroachment drive. Vendors will now approach the Supreme Court.

  (NASVI), their apex body, said around 6,000 illegal evictions had taken place in the past 14 days. After an hour-long protest, a delegation led by NASVI’s national coordinator, Arbind Singh, met the LG. “No action should be taken against us till the town vending committees (TVCs) are formed and the LG has assured us that the process will be expedited,” Singh said.
 
 The LG will immediately convene a meeting of municipal commissioners and has asked NASVI to give corrective suggestions on TVCs that he would take up with the urban development department, the association said in a statement. The vendors later decided to give the administration two days to stop the action. “If the promise is not fulfilled, the vendors will intensify their agitation,” Singh said. 
 
 Street Vendors (Protection of Livelihood and Regulation of Street Vending) Act, 2014 makes street vending legal and arbitrary evictions cannot take place, claimed Singh. “Even the   judgement is being wrongly interpreted to target vendors.” Even vendors with tehbazari certificates are being removed, he said, adding that their properties are being destroyed and seized items are not returned.
 
 The UPA-2 government had brought in the 2014 Act but the Delhi government is yet to implement it. The final rules to form the town vending committees was cleared this January.
