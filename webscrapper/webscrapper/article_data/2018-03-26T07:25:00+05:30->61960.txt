Ludhiana: Three days after sustaining serious burns following a freak accident on Thursday, an 11-year-old boy succumbed to injuries on Saturday evening.

 The boy was injured in a blast when children playing in the area had accidently set turpentine oil on fire at Maloud area of Khanna.
 
 The deceased was identified as Gurjot Singh, a Class VI student at Maalodaud village in Maloudh.
 
 Police officials said on March 22, Gurjot Singh along with his friends was playing in the Baba Banda Singh Gurdwara in the village. The villagers had got the gurdwara painted about 15 to 20 days back and the unused turpentine oil boxes were still lying at the premises.
 
 Cops said while playing, the children accidently set the boxes on fire which resulted in the blast. They added that clothes of Gurjot Singh caught fire and his body received serious burns especially on the front side.
 
 Police officials said villagers doused off the fire by putting clothes on the burning Gurjot. They added that later boy’s family took him to a private hospital in Ludhiana where he breathed his last on Saturday.
 
 Assistant sub-inspector Nachattar Singh, acting station house officer, Maloudh police station, said they initiated inquest proceedings under Section 174 of CRPC into the matter as family didn’t blame anyone for the accident. He added the boy had received 70-80% burns.
 
 Police officer said the body was handed over to his family after the autopsy. He added that the deceased was youngest of the three sons of Beant Singh.
