HYDERABAD: For the past nine years,ever since she was born,   has been going through painful blood transfusions every 20 days. For the young thalassaemia patient, life is a series of shifts between home and hospital.

 Bhavana was diagnosed with Thalassaemia Major immediately after she was born. It is an inherited blood disorder in which the body makes an abnormal form of haemoglobin. The disease leads to poor growth, impaired physical activities, facial, other bone deformities, and enlargement of liver and spleen.
 
 “For nine years, my niece has been undergoing blood transfusions. Missing or even delaying a singletransfusion can cost her life,” said  , her uncle.
 
 But the family now has a ray of hope. According to doctors, a bone marrow transplant will save   and the family has found a donor with the help of Datri, a notfor-profit organisation that helps those suffering from life threatening blood disorders.
 
 The surgery will replace Bhavana’sdamagedbone marrow with healthy stem cells, enabling her to lead a normal life. The procedure costs nearly ?25 lakh. “Our hope lies in contributions of caring strangers,” Murthy said.
 
 “We have no means to affordthatkindof money.Therefore, we started a fund-raising campaign,” he said. He added that blood transfusions were done for free at Thalassaemia and Sickle Cell Society in Charminar, but getting medicines have not been easy .
 
 “Bone marrow transplantation offers a 90% chance of cure,” said Dr  , the haematologist who will perform the surgery.
