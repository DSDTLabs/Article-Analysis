SURAT:   (SUDA) is preparing an urban development strategy to cover 985 sq km of SUDA areas and 135 villages of Choriyasi, Palsana, Kamrej and Olpad talukas and three nagarpalikas in the district.

 Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, which has been appointed consultants for the urban development strategy, will conceive basic infrastructural facilities for the areas that will be later brought within   (SMC) limits. 
 
 “We would be giving priority to 10 km area near municipal limits to set up the infrastructure facilities,” SUDA chief executive officer   said. The state government has turned its focus on SUDA areas where many mega projects like high speed rail, dedicated freight corridor, national expressway extension from Vadodara to Surat, Surat metro rail, outer ring road, and dream city will be coming up. 
 
 “New town planning schemes would be made for Sachin, Icchapore, Haripura and others areas for regulated urban development. We envisage a tri-city of   and   in the years to come. This area could have a population of about 1.10 crore by 2035,” Nagrajan added. 
 
 At present, this area, including those of SUDA, has a population of about 50 lakh people and is already undergoing the change. Senior town planner of SUDA P N Datta said, “This strategy will help identify priority areas for development and also ensure that there is complete harmony between planning and design for massive infrastructure development in the region. Urban development strategy will also focus on proper planning of road junctions and the financial models that are required.”
 
 SUDA and SMC officials said the urban development strategy would trigger development of residential and commercial projects in the peripheral areas of the city.
