The meeting also extended full support to the decision of the committee in recommending the suspension of the 10 party legislators and "vehemently condemn the shameful act of treason and betrayal perpetrated by few ring leaders to destabilise the party-led government to fulfil their selfish ends." 

 "Express our deep resentment over the attempt to destabilise the government when the government of India was trying its best to resolve the   without delay. This latest political move will only sabotage the sincere attempts of the government to bring a lasting settlement, which is the ardent desire of the Naga people," the party office-bearers' meeting resolved. 
 
 The 65-year-old   was replaced by Liezietsu five months ago after he was forced to step down as public outcry over the government's decision to reserve seats in urban local bodies for women escalated.
 
 "The political crisis in Nagaland is solely due to chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu's undemocratic style of functioning in both the party and the government. Because of his style of functioning, the MLAs are not happy and don't feel secure under his leadership when the state is going to the polls next year. As such, a majority of them are all for a change of guard," Zeliang said before leaving a resort at the Kaziranga National Park, where he and his 34 supporters have been camping at since Friday after pulling the rug from under Liezietsu's feet.
 
 Zeliang is also likely to meet Narendra Modi and   in Delhi.
