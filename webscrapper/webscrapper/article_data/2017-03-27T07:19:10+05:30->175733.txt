MUMBAI:   will launch 30 brand new AC buses--15 multi-axle and 15 Shivneri--in the first week of April. However, the move has kicked off a controversy as those in the bus industry alleged on Sunday that the vehicles which conform to Euro-III emission norms were being `dumped' on the MSRTC. According to a source, from April 1, all bus manufacturers across the country will switch to making vehicles with Euro-IV norms.

 MSRTC managing director Ranjit Singh Deol said: “There is nothing wrong in the buses with Euro-III emission norms.Though, from April 1, bus ma nufacturers have been asked to comply with the new rules and manufacture Euro-IV buses, we can still procure vehicles with old emission norms.“
 
 Deol also pointed out that the buses were not being purchased and were only being taken on lease. Another official said that Euro-IV buses are costlier than Euro-III.
