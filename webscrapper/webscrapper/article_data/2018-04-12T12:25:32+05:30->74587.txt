PATIALA: A day after bodies of the two minors were fished out from the under-construction   at DRM Complex in  , several lapses of railway officials have come to the fore. The victims’ families, with the support of the local councillor, now demand compensation and a job from the general manager at  , who visited the accident site in Ambala.

 Chitra Sarwara, local councillor of Ward NO 16 in Ambala cantonment area said, “We thoroughly studied the entire matter and found that railway authorities are on wrong foot as they failed to take any precautions. The minors cannot be blamed. The boundary wall should have been raised and a permanent guard was supposed to keep a vigil over it till the construction was completed. We have demanded compensation for the victims’ families from the   who was here in Ambala on Wednesday.”
 
 The authorities failed to drain the stagnant water from the pool. There was no guard at the site as the boundary wall of the pool was left half broken. On Tuesday, police and railway authorities blamed the children for having crossed the boundary of the DRM complex but it was found that one side of the complex was left opened as on Tuesday the water was pumped out with the help of a tractor that entered from the opened boundary.
 
 The family has submitted a written complaint to the police against the DRM railways alleging them as the ones responsible for the death of the children. 
 
 Bhushan Dass, SHO at Pudau police station said, “The postmortem has been conducted but the cause of death is not clear yet. The family is demanding registration of a case against the officials of railways.”
 
 DRM Ambala   could not be contacted despite repeated phone calls and messages.
