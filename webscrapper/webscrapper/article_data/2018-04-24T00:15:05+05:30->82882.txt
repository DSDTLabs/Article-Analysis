Moradabad: In a major crackdown as many as 16 people were arrested for burning e-waste on the bank of Ramganga river and 22 sacks of e-waste recovered from their possession here on Sunday evening.   The crackdown — led by SP (city) Ankit Mittal — was a part of the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) order to the Uttar Pradesh government and the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) to check the burning of e-waste on the banks of Ramganga.    Police also impounded the vehicles used for transporting the e-waste to the river bank.    Speaking with TOI, Mittal said, “We had information that a huge quantity of e-waste was being transported to the city and adjoining areas from Delhi and neighbouring districts for extraction of metal by burning discarded electronic gadgets. This produces toxic fumes which is harmful to both humans and the environment.”    The accused were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sent to jail after they were produced before the magistrate.    Recently, Moradabad police and pollution control board officials raided e-waste recycling units and seized tons of material from various localities under the Kathghar police station jurisdiction.  According to police, after raids, those who extract metals shifted their operation to the interior areas.    In 2015, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) Research had revealed that the situation was alarming in Moradabad. The report warned of serious health hazards, including cancer, and pollution to the environment. The report was presented to both Union and state governments.
