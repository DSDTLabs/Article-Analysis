KOLKATA: India pacer Md Shami’s statements that his wife   Jahan kept him in dark about her earlier marriage to a Suri trader — and the subsequent separation — were on Thursday refuted by Hasin’s lawyer   who claimed Shami should back his claims with evidence. “Unfounded allegations will cut no ice. Where is the proof? All our claims have been backed with proof which has led police to drawn up criminal charges against him,”   said.

 Zakir said Shami, whom Hasin married in 2014 after meeting him for the first time in 2012, was aware of her first marriage as he was a “regular” at her Suri home. Also debunking claims by Shami that he has spent Rs 1.5 crore on Hasin in the four years after they got married in 2014, Zakir said the cricketer has only booked an apartment in Hasin’s name in Suri. “The rest of the purchases he made, including property, has either been in his name or that of his kin,” Zakir said. The lawyer during the day deliberated at length with Hasin after Shami made his claims before various media houses in UP’s Amroha.
 
 Kolkata Police are keeping a close watch on the statements. Hasin may appear before a judicial magistrate on Monday to record her in-camera testimony. According to police, if her statement bears out her primary complaints against Shami, there will remain little window for Shami to evade law.
 
 Earlier in the day, Shami told reporters that he was not even aware that Hasin had two daughters — he claimed he was first introduced to the two children as Hasin’s niece and told that they were her deceased sister’s daughters.
 
 On Wednesday, Jahan went to  , the sixth time in the last six days, from where the investigating officer took her to the Calcutta Medical College where her medical examination was conducted.
