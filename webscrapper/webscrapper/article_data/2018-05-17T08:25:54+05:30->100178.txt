 "As the case is bailable, the persons get out of jail in a few days," Mailardevpally sub-inspector   said.
 
 Before the Mailardevpally case, the police had stopped four child marriages in the city. "So far, we have stopped nine child marriages in Hyderabad district limits this year. Most victims were from poor families and were unaware of law," an official from the women and child welfare d epartment said.
 
 However, child rights activists claim they foiled 18 child marriages in the city. "We are seeking constitutional amendment to the minimum age of marriage for girls. We want the government to raise it from 18 to 21. If the minimum age of drinking is 21, child marriage is way more harmful to the girl child, both mentally and physically," Balala Hakkula Sangham president Achyuta   said.
 
 “Women can be financially independent only if they are educated. Also, girls in the 14-16 age group are not mature enough to understand the person they are marrying. Marriage at a young age not only affects the girl’s health, but also derails her education," Rao added.
