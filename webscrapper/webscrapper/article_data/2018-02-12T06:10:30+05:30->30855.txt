Bengaluru: Residents of Sanjaynagar/RMV celebrated the transformation of a smelly, black spot into a clean, freshly painted section of the street by organizing ‘Midnight Open Street’ from 9pm to 12 midnight on Saturday. About 200 people gathered to play music, dance and engage in sports. 

 Residents say that the spot, which covered an area of four plots, had become a dump yard over time making it an eyesore. Last week, residents along with   officials and Ugly Indian, the  , cleaned the place up.
 
 “We did not expect a lot of people to come (for Midnight Open Street) since it was in the night, but it was really lovely to reclaim the space,” said  , a resident who participated in the clean-up and who helped organize Open Street. “Much of the dumping would happen during the night so this was a symbolic message to warn people not to mistake this for an abandoned place anymore.”
 
 She added: “The event was a lot of fun and a lot of people made new friends. Even BBMP commissioner   came and stayed for 45 mins. He lives in the area and participated as a resident to interact with others.”
