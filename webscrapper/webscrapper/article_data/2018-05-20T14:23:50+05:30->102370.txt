 Lily Allen, 33, has detailed a secret battle with alcohol which - at its worst - saw her consume a bottle of vodka each day.

 According to a report, at one point, during her tour in 2014, she even struggled to decipher between hard liquor and still water.
 
  
  
 Her revelation comes in an interview with a magazine.
 
 She said,"I was drinking a bottle of Grey Goose (vodka) a day. Part of it was I was really heavy after I gave birth to Marnie, my youngest, and I lost a lot of weight."
 
 "I was trying to meet the beauty standards and wasn't eating and I felt very insecure about the way I looked."
 
 "I lost my house and my kids started to feel distant and I broke up with my husband."
 
 To combat this, she completed six months of sobriety. She also attended 90 dependency meetings.
