NEW DELHI: After coming under attack from the opposition for his pledge to make  , chief minister   said on Monday that he believed Delhi is unique in its own way and he only meant that if voted to power in the corporations, AAP would make Delhi as clean as European cities like London. 

 “I want to clarify that I have not said that we will turn Delhi into London. Delhi has its own culture and its heart...Delhi’s people are very good,” he said. 
 
 If AAP wins the municipal elections, it will improve the sanitation situation in a year to make Delhi clean, the chief minister said. “When we go to western countries, we see a high level of cleanliness there. Delhi will be made as clean as London, which only AAP can do,” he claimed. “It is only AAP that can clean up Delhi as people know that we have done unprecedented work in education, water, power and health.” 
 
 On Sunday, in a highly emotive and politically charged speech at a public rally at Uttam Nagar while inaugurating sewers and drains, Kerjiwal promised to give the civic management of Delhi such a makeover that it will be “comparable to London in just one year”.
 
  president   hit out at Kejriwal on Monday, saying “he should first make Delhi a better Delhi before planning to make it London”.
 
 “We want to ask Kejriwal that if he wants to make Delhi as beautiful a city as London, then what efforts PWD has made under his control for beautifying main roads and regularising unauthorised colonies,” Tiwari said.
 
 The BJP leader also sought to know what work has been undertaken by the transport department for the development of public transport. 
 
 “I also want to know what steps have been taken by your horticulture department to make Delhi a green city,” Tiwari asked.
