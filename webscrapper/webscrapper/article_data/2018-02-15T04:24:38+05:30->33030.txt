MUMBAI: Bombay   on Wednesday told the state to consider balancing   of   with rights of   and hospitals while bringing in legislation for regulating clinical establishments.

 The court heard a PIL which was converted out of petitions filed in 2014 to release patients detained by hospitals over disputed  . Subsequently, the government had said it proposed a law and submitted a draft Maharashtra Clinical Establishments (Registration & Regulation) Bill, 2014.
 
 A bench headed by Justice Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari summoned the advocate general to ask him to “consider seriously’’ issues including whether fees of doctors can be regulated by the state. The judges distinguished between a bill charged individually by a doctor and that of a hospital. They explained that even if a doctor attached to a hospital decides to waive or give a concession in his charges, it may not be reflected in the composite bill issued by the hospital which has to bear the cost of running it. They also said a patient who is fit and no longer requires treatment cannot be unlawfully confined by the hospital. “Can the state consider bringing in a law of the nature which balances their rights with patients rights?” asked the bench. 
 
 Advocate Rui Rodrigues, representing Association of Medical Consultants, of doctors and small to medium hospitals and nursing homes, said, “Our members feel patients should not be detained. But the issue of   bills needs to be sorted out.” 
 
 Advocate Rahul Gaikwad, representing Association of Hospitals, which includes Lilavati, Hinduja and Bombay hospitals, said it had written to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority whether it can float a scheme to insure persons in such situations. The judges said it will be of “great service’’ if hospitals can evolve a self-regulatory mechanism, and “state intervention should be the last resort’’.
