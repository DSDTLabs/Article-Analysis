KOLKATA: One constable for each polling booth and an armed policeman for each poll premise are the basics of the state’s security plan for the coming panchayat   after the   government turned down the opposition’s demand for central forces for a second time.

 Police patrols,   (RAF) and flying squads will remain as usual for surveillance and crisis management. “There is no such proposal for any kind of CCTV coverage, live streaming or videography,” a senior official of the state home department said, when the   mandates videography in at least 50% of booths.
 
 While opposition parties scoffed at the security plan, calling it “a recipe for absolute domination of the ruling party on polling day”, a section of   officials argued that bringing in central forces was no remedy for the continuing violence. “There were 21 deaths in the 2013 panchayat polls when the   ordered a five-phase rural poll in presence of central forces,” a state official said.
 
 The state bureaucracy is eyeing the Supreme Court’s ruling on Bengal rural polls on Monday before it goes ahead with its plan. This could be a reason why the state administration didn’t map the sensitive areas that it usually does ahead of polls.
