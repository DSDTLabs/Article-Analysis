KOLKATA: Weeks after winter retreated, the first thunderstorm of the season hit parts of Bankura, Purulia and Birbhum on Sunday evening; hailstorm hit Midnapore later at night, while parts of Howrah witnessed a spell of drizzle. With even Kolkata slated for a round of thundershowers between March 8 and 11, the Met office has predicted a drop in already-rising temperature by the weekend.

 The south-westerly and southerly winds have been blowing in moisture in abundance over the past few days, forming clouds, an official said. Another wind system from the north-west, which is cold and dry, has been invading the city and adjoining areas since Saturday, making it favourable for thunderstorms. “On one hand, we have wet and warm south and south-westerly winds bringing moisture into the land from the sea. On the other, we have this cold and dry north-westerly blowing in. The two opposing wind system will cause the rain,” said  , deputy director general at Regional Meteorological Centre, Kolkata. 
 
 The thunder-shower around this time of the year is, however, not nor’wester. Meteorologists said that the spells of rain were caused by local convective clouds. Owing to moisture incursion, the maximum temperature soared to 35.9 degrees Celsius on Friday, four degrees above the normal level. But as the cold and dry wind started entering the city, the mercury dropped by a couple of degrees by Saturday. “We are expecting rain or thundershowers from March 8 to 11. If it rains enough, it will definitely push the mercury level down,” added Bandyopadhyay.
