MOHALI: The much-awaited airport runway resurfacing project that will enable the arrival and departure of   from western countries to Chandigarh International Airport is likely to see the light of day as Indian Air force (IAF) announced the closure of the runway from February 12 to 16.

 The length of the runway will be elongated in the resurfacing during which no civil and military flight will operate from Chandigarh airport informed official spokesperson of the airport. During this period technologically advance treatment will be carried out on the surface of runway and it is mandatory to close the runway for operations.
 
 The resurfacing is being carried out to cater to wide body aircrafts which will facilitate the long haul flights to Europe, USA, Canada, UK and other countries.
 
 Suneel Dutt, CEO of   (CHIAL) said, “The upgraded runway will be a gift for the region as it will facilitate wide body aircrafts and will also be useful to commuters of surrounding states. 
 
 The countries farther than 5,000 km will attract several flagship airlines operators to operate flights from Chandigarh with the aid of open sky policies of government of India. This would have not been possible on existing runway.”
