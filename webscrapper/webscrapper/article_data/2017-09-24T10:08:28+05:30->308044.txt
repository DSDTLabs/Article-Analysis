PANCHKULA: Setting yet another benchmark, the civil hospital here has carried out a total of 27,364 MRI scans over a period of two years topping the list of carrying out the maximum scans. The count is part of the total 1.50 lakh scans carried out across   over two years.

 Panchkula civil surgeon   and principal medical officer (PMO)   elaborated upon the facilities available. Panchkula became the first civil hospital in Haryana to start the MRI and CT scan facility in public private partnership (PPP) with Haryana health department’s partner HealthMap diagnostics. The facility was initiated in September 2015. 
 
 HealthMap officials said Panchkula tops the list of civil hospitals with maximum scans. PMO Veena Singh said besides the quality reporting, the affordable rates of the scanning facility has led to the increased MRI scans. “The team here works round the clock,” she said.
 
 After Panchkula, Sonipat is the second such district where the civil hospital has reached a mark of 26,599 MRI scans.
 
 Amit Khokhar, the MRI centre head added that Gurugram, Bhiwani, Mewat, Kaithal, Jind, Yamunangar, Kurukshetra and Panipat have been added under the partnership program.
