GAYA: Poor visibility at the Gaya airport forced Buddhist spiritual leader the Dalai Lama to skip the seven seater special plane waiting at the Varanasi airport to fly to Bodh Gaya. The Nobel peace prize recipient instead took road route to reach the Tibetan monastery, his   address late on Monday evening about five hours behind his scheduled arrival in the afternoon.

 Thousands of Dalai Lama followers from different parts of the world including USA and several European countries have already arrived in Bodh Gaya to benefit from the spiritual leaderâ€™s sermons. He would be delivering sermons called teaching by his followers at the historical Kalchakra Maidan, about 200 meters to the north-west of seat of Buddha's enlightenment. 
 
 The Buddhist spiritual leader will be staying here for a month and this is going to be his longest sojourn in Bodh Gaya. The visit is likely to have a positive impact on tourist footfall in Bodh Gaya. According to Gaya airport director Dilip Kumar, other scheduled flights operated from the Gaya airport but on account of extra precaution, the spiritual leader's travel managers decided to play it safe and take the road route. On its part, the   (AAI) did not deny landing permission to the spiritual leader's aircraft, said the airport director.
 
 Elaborate security arrangements with deployment of nearly 2,500 police personnel of different ranks and establishment of a round-the-clock functional control room have been made for the all important visit of the high risk spiritual leader.
