Documentary filmmaker  , who accused   of raping her in 2016, has dropped her lawsuit against him. Jarosik filed the suit in January, seeking USD 5 million. 

  
  
  She had alleged that Simmons invited her to his home and then physically overpowered her. She also repeated the claim in an interview in which she alleged that Simmons also sexually assaulted her at his office in 2011. Her attorney said the second episode fell outside the statute of limitations. 
 
 Simmons denied the claims, and earlier this month filed an answer to the suit quoting from emails and text messages from Jarosik. 
 
  In a message a few weeks after the 2016 incident, she wrote, 'Sending love'. A few days later, she wrote 'I miss you Russell. are you ok?' In his reply to the suit, Simmons' attorney also alleged that Jarosik had been deemed an unfit parent and was found by a court to have a 'propensity to exaggerate' and 'untreated mental health issues.'
 
  "Only after hearing that women were able to recover money for real abuse by actual sexual predators, did Ms Jarosik decide to see if she could extract large amounts of money from Mr. Simmons," his attorney wrote.
