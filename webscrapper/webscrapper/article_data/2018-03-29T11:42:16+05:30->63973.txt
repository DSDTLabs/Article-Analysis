CHENNAI: T T V Dhinakaran, who recently floated the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) has said   leaders are approaching courts to restrain the   from using its party   out of fear of losing their hold over the party and power.

 “The people in Tamil Nadu are smart enough to differentiate between Anna on the AIADMK flag and Amma on our party flag,” TTV told reporters in Thanjavur on Wednesday. “The court has not stayed, but only kept in abeyance the   order. We have been given time to submit our views and we will succeed in our efforts,” he said.
 
 He was reacting to the   on Wednesday ordering a Delhi high court order – asking the   to consider allotting the ‘pressure cooker’ symbol to AMMK – to be kept in abeyance. It also asked the Delhi high court to set up a two-judge bench to decide on the main dispute between the two AIADMK factions – the ruling faction and the TTV faction.
