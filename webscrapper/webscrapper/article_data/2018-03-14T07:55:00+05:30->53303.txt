CHANDIGARH: The war of words between AAP leader   and technical education minister   continued on Tuesday over the issue of   in the state.

 Khaira said he accepted the challenge given by   to take oath at   on the issue of illegal mining. He, however, added that the condition that he (Channi) should convince chief minister   to come along and clarify why he took false oath under “Gutka Sahib”, promising to eradicate drugs within four weeks of assuming power. Reacting to this, Channi said the conditions put by   proves his allegations were false.
 
 “Again Khaira has backtracked from his allegations on illegal mining and cooked up another theory, which proves to be a sign of his mental sickness. I am ready to participate in the ardas at Darbar Sahib on the mining issue and Khaira should also come forward for this without any condition,” he said.
 
 Khaira said in fact the chief minister should get a VB probe conducted into all six mining sites that he tweeted about from his helicopter. Khaira said he demanded this as the Mandala mine had benami investment and therefore it was mandatory for the government to probe all six mines to find benami investments by more   leaders.
