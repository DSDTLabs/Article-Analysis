MARGAO: Alleging that defence minister   is lying and fooling the public by not answering as to how it is viable to have two airports in the state,   (GFDO) on Thursday questioned the validity of Parrikar’s latest assurance that ‘the   has already taken a decision to retain   once Mopa becomes a reality’.

 GFDO also drew Parrikar’s attention to the fact that the Mormugao Surface Utilization Plan, issued by the state-level committee for Regional Plan for Goa 2021, also shows Goa international airport at Dabolim as a fully defence domestic airport, with no existing transportation connectivity to civilian areas for horizon year 2021. 
 
 GFDO urged Goans, especially the tourism stakeholders like hoteliers and taxi drivers, to reject and refrain from re-electing the present Goa BJP government and those legislators supporting it. 
 
 Remarking that the Goa assembly polls is an opportunity for the electorate to teach the politicians a lesson, GFDO demanded that all political parties and independent candidates declare their stand on the present Dabolim airport and the proposed Mopa international airport. GFDO convener Fr Eremito Rebelo cautioned the electorate ‘to apply their minds and match the assurances with the reality while exercising their democratic rights’. “Or else, we may find ourselves in the unhappy position of having bartered our economy, our land, our identity and our ecology in exchange of unfulfilled promises,” said Rebelo.
