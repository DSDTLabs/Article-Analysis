NAGPUR: The by-election for seat-A in ward no. 35 is all set to be an emotional contest. BJP has denied ticket to deceased corporator Nilesh Kumbhare’s younger brother   who has now decided to contest as an independent candidate.

 The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC)   received 15 nominations for the by-election till the last date on Saturday. First-time corporator Nilesh (34) had passed away following a brief illness on April 10, two months after the election. He was activist of RPI (Athawale) group but contested from BJP ticket due to an alliance between the two parties.
 
 Ashish told TOI that BJP denied him ticket at 12 noon on Saturday. “I was in touch with BJP leaders who had assured me the ticket. The party, however, declared another name at the last moment,” he said.
 
 Ashish further said he will try his best to retain his brother’s seat. “I want to contest only to retain my brother’s seat,” he said.
 
 BJP has fielded former corporator  , who is close to Union minister Nitin Gadkari. Gavai, who is not a resident of ward 35, had lost in 2012 municipal elections against MLC Prakash Gajbhiye and was not given ticket in the last election.
 
 Congress has roped in Pankaj Thorat, who had lost to Nilesh by around 3,000 votes. NCP and Shiv Sena are not contesting the poll. BSP has fielded former corporator Nanda Zodape.
 
 City president of RPI (Athawale) Rajan Waghmare said, “We would have fielded someone from Nilesh’s family or any other as per parliamentary board decision but the BJP rejected our candidate. We will decide further course of action on Sunday,” he said.
 
 Sources told TOI that BSP and RPI factions rejected proposal by BJP’s senior corporator from ward 35 Avinash   to not field their candidates.
 
 Scrutiny of forms will be done on September 25, withdrawal on September 27, distribution of symbol on September 28 and publication of final contenders on September 28. Polling will be done on October 11 and counting on October 12.
