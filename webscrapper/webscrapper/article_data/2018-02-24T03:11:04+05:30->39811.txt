NEW DELHI: The   on Friday agreed to hear BJP leader   seeking SIT probe into mysterious death of Congress leader Shashi  's wife   and issued notice to Delhi Police, which is conducting investigation in the case. 

 While issuing the notice, a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and A M Khanwilkar said it will first examine the maintainability of Swamy's petition in which he has alleged that police were not conducting the probe in a fair manner. 
 
 After being snubbed by the Delhi HC, which had in October dismissed his PIL calling it a "textbook example of political interest litigation," Swamy approached the Supreme Court challenging the HC order.
 
 Swamy had earlier told the apex court that he had filed numerous PILs on various issues and his petition on Sunanda's death should also be heard on merit. He had said that the Delhi Police was not conducting proper investigation in the case and the FIR was filed almost one year after the incident.
 
 Swamy, in his plea before the HC, had alleged that police had "botched up" the probe and accused Tharoor of "interfering" in the investigation. The HC had chided both Swamy and advocate   - the second petitioner - for making "sweeping allegations" against Tharoor and the Delhi Police, without giving any basis for the accusations.
