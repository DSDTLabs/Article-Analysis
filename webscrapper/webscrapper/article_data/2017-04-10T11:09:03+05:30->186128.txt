MARGAO: Three opposition panch members of the seven-member Macazana village panchayat boycotted the gram sabha held on Sunday protesting the failure of sarpanch   to conduct mandatory gram sabha meetings on time.

 One of them, Francis D’Costa, told TOI that this meeting was held only after the director of panchayats issued a show cause notice to Vaz, along with her ruling group of panch members comprising deputy sarpanch Caitan Vaz, Patricino Vaz and   for not conducting mandatory gram sabha meetings since July 2016.
 
 D’Costa said, “No decision has been taken at the panchayat meetings to not conduct gram sabha meetings. Also, there has been no discussion regarding grievances being faced by villagers. On July 30, 2016, the gram sabha meeting was abandoned by her and not adjourned as she was unable to face the people. The minutes of this meeting, too, were not recorded. On December 11, 2016, both, Vaz and her deputy tried to dissuade the special temporary panchayat secretary as well as BDO observer deputed for the gram sabha meeting from attending it to avoid conducting it. 70 villagers were present. They waited for one hour, but there was no one to answer their queries.”
 
 Meanwhile, panchayat secretary   told TOI that the annual budget of Rs 37 lakhs had been approved by the gram sabha. 
 
 Deputy sarpanch Caitan said, “Cuncolim MLA  , who was present for the meeting, assured us that he would work to solve the grievances of the villagers regarding non-acceptance of water bills by banks as well as frequent power outages. The gram sabha also resolved to increase   tax as many residents have renovated their small residencies into big bungalows.”
