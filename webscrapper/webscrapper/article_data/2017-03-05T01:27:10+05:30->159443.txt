 We examined the response received from the ministry of finance and decided that we should ensure that the five poll-going states are not influenced by any component of the Budget. I think that worked well.
 
 
 
 
 The SC order stated that any mixing of religion, caste, etc, with the election campaign shall be deemed corrupt practice. Now, a corrupt practice can only be challenged in a court. So, I think the impact of the SC judgment will be realised by the candidates once the (election) process is complete and an election petition is filed.
 
  
 
 
 We received complaints against four-five major parties. A new phenomenon we noticed this time was that many of these objectionable comments were made outside the ecode of conductf area. We could not have dealt with things spoken outside the poll-going state. We also examined whether outside the pollgoing area, anything was spoken with reference to the pollgoing areas. After studying all these things in totality we issued another advisory last week, covering all aspects. I think the advisory of commission has been received well.
 
 
 
 
 EC stands for transparency in funding of political parties. In the existing law, collections by parties below Rs 20,000 remain anonymous and opaque. With this limit now proposed to be cut to Rs 2,000, it will bring transparency in a certain way.
 
 
 
 
 Once the commission receives the outline of the scheme formally, it will be evaluated from the angle of transparency vs anonymity. But, in general, any scheme that does not reduce or rather tries to increase anonymity of the donors will not be in line with the commissionfs stand. Donorsf details must be available.
 
 
 
 
 We have no formal communication from the government on holding consultations regarding simultaneous polls.
 
 EC is of the view that relevant amendments in the Constitution must be made first, and certain imponderables like no-confidence motion and imposition of Presidentfs rule, break in coalition alliance and splits, debated. Thereafter, EC can, with the availability of EVMs, finances and forces, conduct such an exercise.
 
  
 
 
 As regards making bribery a ground for countermanding election, we have taken this up with the government twice. On both occasions, the government stand was that EC could deal with bribery matters under Article 324 and so status quo should be there. The commission has now gone on record (for a third time) stating that there is a need to amend the RP Act to make bribery, based on evidence, a ground for EC to countermand elections. The commission will continue to pursue it. On totaliser machines, the GoM that evaluated the proposal did not endorse it. We have written to the government again around 10 days back, reiterating that the convenience of political parties cannot override the need to ensure secrecy and protection of voters.
 
 
 
 
 If someone wants to criticise us for doing the right thing, we leave it to him and the people at large to judge.
