GURUGRAM: Four persons fell   allegedly after eating prasad at a temple in Gurugram late on Sunday evening. They were rushed to Civil Lines hospital, where doctors suspected that they might have had laddoos laced with sedatives or narcotic substance.

 A preliminary probe revealed that Sumitra (70), Manju (45), Hitesh (38) and Rashmi (35), all of the same family from   in Hapur (UP), had gone to offer prayers on the occasion of Ram Navami and ate laddoos offered as prasad at the temple. A close family friend, who had also gone to the temple, said the four complained of sickness soon after and were rushed to the general hospital around midnight.
 
 “We kept them under observation for a few hours and then referred them to the Safdarjung hospital for toxicology tests,” said Pradeep Sharma, the principal medical officer at the general hospital.
 
 Police said the four persons were out of danger now. No FIR has been filed in the case.
