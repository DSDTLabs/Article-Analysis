INDORE:Following an enforcement drive carried last month for the first time in state by   (AERB) a large number of government and private health institutions offering   have approached the authority for  .

 Sources from AERB claimed that due to fear of strict actions against them, over 21 government and  , 16 from Bhopal and nine from Ujjain have approached the AERB to obtain the licence.
 
 “After the enforcement drive, we are continuously monitoring everything and observing growth of number of institutions,” AERB scientific officer BK Singh told TOI.
 
 The board had sealed four X-ray units and had warned 41 units of several government and private health institutions during a three-day-long enforcement drive carried out in Bhopal, Indore and Ujjain on January 18.
 
 The team had asked the institutions to meet norms and conditions, including, availability of trained operators, thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) badges, lead apron and lead lined door. They were also asked to maintain standard width of nine inches of a X-ray unit’s wall
 
 They were also told that non-compliance with regulatory and radiation safety measures at an X-ray unit that include X-ray, CT-scan and cath lab machine can be hazardous for patients as well as operators and other staff. “It increases the possibility of cancer, cataract and hair-fall. Besides, X-ray unit staff and those residing in the vicinity are exposed to serious health-related issues depending on the amount of radiation emanating” a senior AERB official mentioned.
 
 The board is likely to conduct a drive to examine and seal the health facilities violating the norms in near future.
 
 “In Madhya Pradesh, things are still disorganised. AERB does not have the data of exact number of institutions offering X-ray facilities. We are verifying the institutions and planning necessary actions accordingly. We may soon visit or revisit the places to streamline the things,” Singh said.
