SALEM: An activist has petitioned the state principal secretary of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment (HR&CE) department seeking stern action against a set of people for encroaching on   at Jagirkamanaickenpatty near Suramangalam here and constructing buildings there.

 In his petition to HR&CE state principal secretary Apurva Varma, founder president of Tiruthoundargal Sabai A Radhakrishnan said some people had encroached on about 15 acres land belonging to   temple some two decades ago. “But, HR&CE officials haven’t so far taken any action against them,” he said.
 
 According to him, encroachers have constructed houses, shops and commercial establishments on the temple land. “I had brought this issue to the notice of HR&CE officials seven years ago. But, the officials didn’t take any action,” he alleged.
 
 Radhakrishnan suggested that the HR&CE department could generate revenue by way of rent if the officials approve the land. “Instead of demolishing the buildings, the department could collect rent from the encroachers if it were to approve the land and alter the government records,” he said.
 
 Apurva Varma received the petition and directed the commissioner of HR&CE R, Jaya, and joint commissioner of   HR&CE, T Varadharajan, to look into the issue at the earliest.
