KOLKATA: Guardians of students of a central Kolkata school blocked   during morning peak hours over 100%   imposed by the school. Police promised to arrange a meeting with the school authority and persuaded them to withdraw the blockade.

 On Tuesday morning, the guardians first staged an agitation at the school gates. When the school refused to pay heed to the agitation, they squatted at the   crossing. They were angry that the school doubled the fees without any consultation with the parents. The school lacks infrastructure, there are issues with toilets and there is not enough   coverage, the guardians alleged.
 
 The principal of the school could not be contacted despite several attempts.
 
 “It was during the morning peak hours and the blockade caused massive chaos. The tail of the snarl threatened to choke AJC Bose Road flyover. We spoke with the parents but they insisted on meeting the principal. After a lot of persuasion, the principal agreed to meet the parents on Wednesday at 3pm. After we conveyed the message to the parents, they agreed to withdraw the blockade,” said a local traffic guard officer.
