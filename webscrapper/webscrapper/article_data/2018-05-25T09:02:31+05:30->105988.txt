CHANDIGARH: As you drive up to Sector 45, you surely won’t miss a huge ground with piles of   on the opposite side of the road.

 Even in the presence of a fair number of dumpsters around, the residents of Sector 45 are seen throwing away buckets full of garbage on the ground, which could well have been used for recreational purposes for children and adults alike. Given the crammed appearance of the surroundings, lack of bigger playgrounds is an important deficiency of the sector. “I have just seen this ground get more choked with garbage of different kinds a little more everyday. Now, you cannot even walk here. The smell is unbearable and the sight is appalling,” said  , a resident of the area. 
 
 The ground is entirely covered with dense undergrowth of shrubs, thick vegetation, consisting of itching grass, thorny bushes among other kinds of wild plants. Moreover, the park has thick layers of domestic waste, which is rotting along with pools of plastic bags, sheets, disposable cups, plates among others.
 
 The park also has mall mountains of construction debris, leather-wear residue, toiletries, medical waste and even discarded hardware equipment, which are dumped by the numerous shopkeepers owning booths in the Burail market located on the opposite side of the ground.
 
 “Not just the domestic waste is thrown here by residents, but a large amount of market waste is also deposited on this ground. A lot of rubber parts, pieces of tyres among others are found here. It is disgusting,” said Ramdhari, a street vendor. 
 
 Taking the condition of the surroundings seriously, several complaints have been raised by the residents of the locality with their local councillor, but no action has been taken so far. 
 
 In-charge of public health, municipal corporation, could not be contacted even after repeated attempts.
