NAGPUR: Itwari-based bookies predict an even bigger victory for the ruling   than their initial estimate of 76-80 seats in the  . The bookies are now saying that BJP will bag 82-85 seats. 

 The bookies, including a biscuit manufacturer-cum-bookmaker at Itwari, are now offering odds ‘at par or equal’ to the chances of winning seats for each party. 
 
 It was reliably learnt that the state chief minister   and Union minister Nitin Gadkari’s stepping into the campaign last week had revived the BJP wave in the city. The congress, marred by the internal rivalries aggravated by ink-throwing on their former CM  , on the other hand seemed to be losing its ground in the bookmaker’s market too. After pegging their chances to 36-40 seats last week, the Itwari-based bookies feel that their chances have further lessened to winning somewhere between 32 and 37 seats. 
 
 According to an insider, the punters too are expected to come in large numbers in the last 36 hours before polling after speculating current party strengths and positions as the campaigns draws end. Though several parties tried to leave marks, the bookies feel the BJP candidates made far more last impressions on the punters as maximum are placing bets on ruling parties. Until an unexpected run of any party, bookies are expected to make some fast moolah with BJP dominating the show. 
 
 “The maximum numbers of punters are expected to place bets on the seats from Sunday onwards and set to continue till February 23,” said an insider.
