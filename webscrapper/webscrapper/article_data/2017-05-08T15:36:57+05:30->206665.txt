 "We have to manage with the existing doctors," said a senior medical officer on condition of anonymity. Additional district medical officer (public health) R Jagadees Patnaik, however, said the situation in the diarrhoea-affected areas is under control. 
 
 "No fresh cases were reported from Polsara and Jagannath Prasad. Three new cases have been reported from Kabisurya Nagar," he said.
