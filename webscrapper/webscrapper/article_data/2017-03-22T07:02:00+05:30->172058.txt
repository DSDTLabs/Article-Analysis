 Chandigarh: A representation to restrict the use of the red beacons in Chandigarh has been submitted to the Chandigarh administration by RTI activist R K Garg, who urged UT to follow the example of the Punjab government. He also cited the example of UP and Delhi, which have restricted the use of red beacons on VIP vehicles.
 
 Requesting immediate review of the   policy in UT, the petitioner pointed out that many junior IAS, PCS, HCS and other officials of the Punjab and Haryana cadre working in the UT are using red and yellow beacons on their vehicles while their counterparts or seniors in Punjab are not allowed to such lights on their vehicles.
