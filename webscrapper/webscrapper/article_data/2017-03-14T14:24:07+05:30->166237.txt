Police discover that Gulabo has been thrown out of Mani's house. Mani asks Nidhi to leave the house as her presence might cause stress to Shagun. Nidhi tells Mani that she too wants to leave as Ishita has discovered that she is not dead. Nidhi tells him to get a fake passport made so she could leave the country. 

 Meanwhile, Ishita tells Raman about Nidhi being alive. She informs him about the records and reports of Nidhi that make it quite evident that she is not dead. Raman decides to accompany Ishita to jail. 
 
 Ishita assures Raman that all would be well and he need not take any stress. She asks him to take care of Adi as he needs his support more than anything else. She also advises him not to shout at his adult son. Raman agrees. 
 
  
  
 On seeing Mani cry, Aaliya decides to find the reason behind it. She approaches Raman and he decides to talk to Mani. 
 
 Pihu is still in touch with Gulabo and shares her whereabouts with her. Ishita rushes to meet her lawyer to discuss Nidhi's post-mortem report. Romi asks Raman to tell Ishita that he is Gulabo. Raman tells him that he would do it when the time is right. 
 
 When the dental records of Nidhi do not match, Ishita is sure of the fact that Nidhi is alive. She tells the lawyer not to approach the police, as she would like to catch Nidhi red-handed herself.
