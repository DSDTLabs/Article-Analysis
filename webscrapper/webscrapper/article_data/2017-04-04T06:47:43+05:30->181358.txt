Mumbai: A Powai businessman, Ajay Gupta, became the first person in the city to be arrested under the newly notified anti-black money Act, which stipulates up to four years’ imprisonment for possession of banned currency.

 If a person is convicted under the Specified Banknotes (Cessation and Liability) Act, 2017, then he/she will have to pay a penalty five times that of the face value of the defunct notes found in their possession. Gupta, a Kandivli resident, identified as Ajay Gupta, was arrested state Anti-Terrorism Squad and the Powai police on Sunday. He owns Universal Infotech Ventures Pvt Ltd in Powai. The police, which acted on a tip-off, found Rs 1.7 crore in demonetised notes. 
 
 Deputy police commissioner (zone X) Vinayak Deshmukh confirmed that the note ban Act is being applied for the first time in the city. “The notes were found in Gupta’s Saki Vihar office. He claimed he was trying to exchange the notes by paying a penalty, but that is not possible,” said Deshmukh. Gupta told the police that said he visited the Reserve Bank of India office to tender the old notes on March 31, but he did not manage to deposit them. 
 
 Several arrests had been made last month in connection with the possession of banned banknotes. In Kherwadi, businessman Vinod Desai and his three associates were taken into custody after they were allegedly found carrying Rs 2.01 crore in demonetised currency. On March 15, the police found the defunct banknotes stored in the boot of Bandra resident Desai’s Audi. The Kherwadi police are waiting for a report from the I-T department before invoking the   Act.
 
 On March 17, the Mulund police arrested five people, including two employees of a financial company, in connection with possession of Rs 1 crore in demonetised currency. In this case, the police haven’t invoked the new law.
