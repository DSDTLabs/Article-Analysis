Rajkot: Barely a day after a man harassed by money lenders committed suicide by consuming poison at the office of commissioner of police (CP),  ,  , an elderly couple too went there and tried to end their lives by consuming poison on Thursday afternoon. 

 However, Tulsi Sarvaiya (57) and his wife Harsha Sarvaiya (52), both residents of Navalnagar on Mavadi Road in Rajkot, were prevented from consuming poison by the timely intervention of sub-inspector K K Jadeja. In their statement to the police, Tulsi said that they were tired of mental and physical torture perpetrated by their son Nilesh (31) and his wife Nikita (27). 
 
 “In his complaint, lodged with Malaviyanagar police station, Tulsi alleged that Nilesh and Nikita wanted to usurp his house — his only property. On Thursday, Nilesh thrashed Tulsi and Harsha and hounded them out of their house, threatening to kill them if they returned. Tormented by this, the couple decided to end their lives and went to the CP office to draw the attention of the police to their plight,” said an official from Malaviyanagar police station. 
 
 Tulsi works as a peon at the office of irrigation department of the state government in the city. 
 
 The CP office has shot to the limelight for suicide cases. On Wednesday evening, Hurchand Khemani alias Haresh (25), a resident of Millpara main road, Garbi Chowk in Rajkot, consumed poison at the CP office premises. He died at Rajkot Civil Hospital. His father Jagdish Khemani (51) accused Dinesh Dangar alias Mama, his son Chirag Dangar and their associate Divyesh Kav of harassing his son for the recovery of Rs 2.8 lakh as an interest amount on Rs 11.5 lakh loan that Hurchand had taken from them. Police arrested the Dangar father-son duo for the crime on Wednesday night.
