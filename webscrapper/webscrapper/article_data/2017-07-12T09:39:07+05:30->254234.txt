COIMBATORE: The sound of wet clothes getting slapped against washing stones has gone feeble on  , one of the oldest dhobi streets in the city. Taps there first stopped giving them drinking water, but gradually went completely dry, washerwomen told TOI.

 Around 30 women, who earn a living doing laundry, under the banner the Coimbatore Edayar Street Kannada Welfare Society, petitioned the district collector on Monday demanding supply of water, even if it is salt water, to be restored to the area.
 
 “Our families, for the past four generations, have been earning a living washing and ironing clothes,” said the association president,  . “Almost 100 women were earning a living from washing clothes and supporting our families with the income,” she said.
 
 The women say they earned around Rs 200 to Rs 300 a day when business was good by charging Rs 15 for washing and ironing one set of clothes. But the amount has come down to as little as Rs 300 per week, they say. “We have now resorted to going to people’s houses, washing and ironing clothes, which allows us to earn only Rs 300 to Rs 500 per month. Our husbands also earn by ironing the clothes we wash. So, if we don’t have water to wash clothes, they do not have clothes to iron,” said another washerwoman,  
 
 The women said that around five months back, when potable water stopping flowing through the pipes, they decided not to protest because many people were struggling to even get water. “However, now with salt and drinking water not coming through our pipes, we are forced to stand in line and collect drinking water and use it to run our livelihood,” said the secretary of the society,  . “When we do that on other roads, women in the locality start fighting with us and chase us away,” said Jayalakshmi. “ We want water supply to be restored to our street,” she said.
 
 Corporation officials said the groundwater level in the   area is on the lower side compared to rest of the city.
