LUCKNOW: A Lucknow court increased the CBI remand of   (BJP)MLA   by three days on Wednesday.

 
 The remand would end on Saturday evening. Sengar is the main accused in   rape case.
 
 This was the fourth extension of Sengar’s remand by
 
 the court since his arrest by the   (CBI) on April 12.
 
 CBI sources claimed the MLA’s custody remand was extended after new revelations by two cops — former station house officer of Makhi police station   and sub-inspector Kamta Prasad Singh — in connection with the case.
 
 The arrested cops told CBI sleuths that Unnao rape survivor’s late father was framed in a case of possessing illegal firearms at Sengar’s behest.
 
 The arrested cops will be brought face-to-face with Sengar again.
