LUCKNOW: When   filed his nomination papers for the   on March 12, he was hardly accompanied by any of senior   leaders. Minutes after he completed all the formalities, BJP state president   walked into the nomination hall and announced that Agarwal would be BJP's ninth candidate. 

  But it was not a surprise as BJP, after announcing eight candidates, still had 28 votes to spare. Agarwal was thus picked up by the BJP as its ninth candidate who would take on the SP, Congress and RLD backed BSP nominee BR Ambedkar. Agarwal was quick to say that he expected support from all sides, including from the opposition parties. 
 
 A wealthy businessman and owner of a chain of professional institutes in   and Meerut, Agarwal has an RSS background and belongs to a powerful political family of the state-he is married to the granddaughter of former UP CM Babu Banarasi Das. Agarwal had contested the legislative council election from the teachers' constituency but lost with a narrow margin.
 
  His win, political experts said, could help BJP consolidate the trader community which got antagonized after Centre effected demonetisation and brought in a new GST regime. Agarwal's emergence as a BJP MP could also mark BJP strategy to consolidate its position in politically crucial west UP region as it gears to take on a joint opposition in 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
