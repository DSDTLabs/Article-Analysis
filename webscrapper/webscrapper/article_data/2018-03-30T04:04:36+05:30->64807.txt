GURUGRAM: In what will come as a relief to thousands of commuters from   and  , NHAI has provided direct access to the main carriageway of  , to those using the   underpass. 

 This was made possible when, on Thursday, developer DLF opened a right turn on the service road near   for those wishing to enter the expressway. 
 
 The new turn, which is a few hundred metres ahead of the earlier one, will also allow those on the expressway to use the service lane to go to DLF 2. Last August, NHAI had closed an entry point to the expressway from this service lane, right after the underpass, ostensibly to reduce accidents.
 
  Since then, commuters from the Udyog Vihar and neighbouring areas had been forced to drive all the way to the perpetually gridlocked Iffco Chowk to enter the expressway, where they would invariably get stuck, as there was no entry point in between. 
 
 To avoid jams at Iffco Chowk, most commuters would cross over from the service lane to the expressway by driving over the pavement in between. NHAI project director Ashok Sharma said, “NHAI had closed the right turn last year after Shankar Chowk underpass became operational, because it was an accident-prone area.” 
 
 Residents welcomed the move. Siddharth Choudhary, who works with an IT firm in Udyog Vihar 4, said, “The right turn will make commuting easier. Currently, some 500m after crossing the Shankar Chowk underpass, I drive over the footpath to my right to enter the expressway. I know it’s wrong, but that’s the easiest way to avoid traffic jams.”
 
 A DLF spokesperson said, “A right turn was earlier open for commuters who wanted to reach the expressway right after crossing the underpass, but it was closed down by NHAI. We have now cleared the way for a new turn right in front of DLF Square, for commuters to enter the expressway. This has been done with NHAI’s approval.”
