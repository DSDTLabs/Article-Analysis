Dahej: Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a jibe at the previous Congress-led UPA government and political adversaries saying that his government was successful in curbing inflation, which had spiraled out of control before he assumed power in 2014.“Recently, 4-5 states went to polls. Our opponents attacked us on various counts. But there was not a single allegation regarding inflation,” Modi said.

 “This is a big achievement considering the sheer scale of the recent elections. Not a single candidate made inflation a poll plank. This implies that we have succeeded in controlling the price rise,” he said.
