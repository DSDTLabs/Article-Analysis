NAWADA: The Nawada DM on Thursday suspended the block development officer (BDO), block agriculture officer (BAO) and ‘krishi salahkar’ of Kauakol block for their alleged involvement in corrupt practices relating to diesel subsidy and allotment of subsidised pump sets to farmers in 2013-14.

 The suspension was ordered on the basis of an inquiry report of the district agriculture officer (DAO).
 
 DAO   told this correspondent on Thursday the trio, including   and BAO  , embezzled subsidy funds allocated by the state government for distribution among farmers to purchase diesel to save their paddy seedlings from withering away due to drought. 
 
 “We are yet to calculate the exact amount... It must be in lakhs,” the DAO said.
 
 The DAO said the diesel pump set subsidy of Rs 10,000 per pump set was also misappropriated.
 
 It may be recalled that former  , who was later posted as  , was arrested by the state vigilance department sleuths while he was accepting Rs 30,000 as bribe from a Buxar fertilizer dealer in November 2015, just a month before his retirement.
