BENGALURU: With citizens replacing their   at a quicker rate than before, the amount of   India generates is increasing rapidly. To ensure the waste, which contains  , is disposed of properly,   came together earlier this month to form   (AEWRA).

 Speaking at the launch, AEWRA founding president Kaleere Gowda said, “The public must be educated about the importance of ensuring that ewaste is segregated and dismantled/ recycled by an authorised authority. While the ‘Make in India’ initiative has become a reality, it has also resulted in significant increase in electronic goods and e-waste, which is why it is important to focus on recycling.”
 
 The association aims at bringing all e-waste recyclers and dismantlers onto one platform and working with the government in enforcing rules. There are 170 authorised recyclers across the country, 75 of whom are from Bengaluru.
 
 Gowda said India generates 18 lakh metric tonnes of e-waste per year, and only a fraction of it reaches regularised recyclers who handle it in a scientific manner. The rest is processed by the unorganised sector. “Karnataka generates some 1 lakh metric tonnes of e-waste, and only 10%-20% of it is handled by us. If it is disposed of in unscientifically, it can harm the environment,”he said.
