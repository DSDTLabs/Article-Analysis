PUDUCHERRY:   while presenting a rosy picture about Puducherry, highlighting the   territory's achievements, did not shy away from sounding the warning bell on financial constraints and pointed out that the anticipated plan expenditure during the current year would be 2,334 crore, which is 11.67% higher compared to last year. 

 "This Union territory is facing financial constraints due to servicing of past debt. Now there is an urgent need to reduce our debt burden and members will certainly appreciate the need for austerity measures," she said while delivering the customary address ahead of the budget session on Monday.
 
 Her comments assumed greater significance with the ongoing tussle between the Raj Nivas and elected   government headed by   over several issues including the nomination of three BJP loyalists as members of the legislative assembly. 
 
 The MLAs were denied entry into the assembly on Monday after the speaker of the legislative assembly V Vaithilingam maintained that their nominations were not valid despite   upholding their nomination.
 
 Stating that the government spends a major portion of the financial resources on committed liabilities like salaries, pension and debt services, she lauded the government for taking timely action for rationalization of expenditure without compromising on unavoidable expenditure under social security programmes for the deserving people of the Union territory. 
 
 "This government is very keen on transparency and accountability in governance and introduced various measures in this direction. 
 
 "The GST introduced by the Union government has been implemented in the Union territory," she said.
