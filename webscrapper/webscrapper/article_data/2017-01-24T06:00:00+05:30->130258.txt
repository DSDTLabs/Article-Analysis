AHMEDABAD: In a surprising twist to the story of the learning-impaired  , cops probing the case have begun questioning the age of the victim, her version of the happenings, as well as whether any rape had taken place at all. However, they were unable to explain, when asked, how the clinical age of the survivor mattered in respect of the offence, trauma, and agony of the girl.

 Cops have now opted for   to ascertain the age of the rape survivor.
 
 A senior police official said they have also asked for MR ( ) test to be conducted as the tale of the   is not making sense to them. “She is changing her version of the incident, every time she is asked. We cannot rely on her statement due to her mental condition,” said a senior police officer.
 
 “The medical report does not confirm rape, but mentions injuries on private parts,” said an investigator adding his own take, “Such injuries could also be caused by a fall.” Meanwhile, cops have recorded statements of the girl’s parents.
