BHOPAL: Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation ( ) have taken a series of steps to keep touts at bay. The demand for railway   go up due to summer rush and getting a   ticket becomes almost impossible. When TOI tried to get to the heart of problem, it emerged touts are making a killing. Here is an example of how they subvert rules to walk away with tatkal tickets.

 It’s 8.00 am and six men, half awake and half asleep walk to their work place — an internet café— in night dresses. All of them switch on their computers and start crediting some amount to their digital wallets. The total money credited was Rs 15,000. Owner of the café started listing names of trains and persons for whom tatkal tickets were to be booked. The internet cafes, needless to say, are unauthorised.
 
 Tatkal bookings for AC coaches begin at 9.00 am. And, by this time all six are ready with their task clearly cut out. Each one of them has to obtain tickets for two clients from different PCs. They all had three different IDs. They log in and wait for IRCTC portal to open. Instructions are clear — ticket in   which is more in demand would be booked first.
 
 As soon as it was 8:59am, all six started logging into their user IDs and started filling up details and book tickets. The only sound you would hear is of hitting keyboard buttons. Ten minutes later, all tickets available were booked.Taking a sigh of relief, they outstretched their arms, giving an impression of a student, who finishes his paper in the nick of time.
