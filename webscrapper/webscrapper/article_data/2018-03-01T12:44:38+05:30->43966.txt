Raj Chakraborty's past few films failed to impress at the box office. To bring out his own magic once again the renowned director is introducing ‘Prem Amar 2’ and the shoot has already started for this romantic flick. He is not directing the venture; rather he will produce the film. And now latest Tollywood rumours suggest the maker of commercial hits like ‘Bojhena Se Bojhena’, ‘Challenge’, and ‘Chirodini Tumi Je Amar’ plans to make a sequel of his another hit ‘Katmundu’.

 Among his recent directorial, ‘Katmundu’ is the only film that scored well at the box office. So, the choice was quite obvious while looking for sequels of own creations. Things are not going well for Raj now. His dream project ‘Tong Ling’ faces a copyright issue even after the   and initial shooting began recently. If ‘Tong Ling’ is shelved for the time being then we may see the sequel ‘Katmundu 2’ sooner than expected.
