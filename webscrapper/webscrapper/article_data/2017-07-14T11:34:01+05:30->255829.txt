Megastar   called out yet another Bollywood star through his   handle for not obliging to his birthday message. This time around, it was 'Padmavati' actor   who found himself on the hot seat. 

 The 'Piku' star candidly commented on a post   shared on his wall saying, "Hey... but what about my intention... sent you sms greetings for your birthday... did not get a reply... did you see it... !??" He even ended his tweet with a kiss face smiley hinting that it was all in good humour. 
 
 Ranveer was quick to reply saying, "Except that I TOTALLY replied! I just cross checked it too! You were, in fact, one of the first to even wish!" He further went on to say how things like these make   one the all time greatest. Ranveer also gushed that he was "blessed" to know that Big B is aware of his existence.
