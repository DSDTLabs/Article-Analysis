 MP   has said that the police case against   teacher   for his remarks against the dressing of women students violated his right to freedom of expression. 

 
 
 
 
 The 'watermelon' remarks of the teacher at a function had evoked widespread protests. 
 
 Koduvalli police had recently registered a case against Jawahar Munawwir, for his sexist remarks during a speech at Narikuni. Many Muslim organizations had strongly condemned the police action.
 
 
 
 Addressing media in Malappuram on Sunday morning, Kunhalikkuty alleged that there has been an attempt to target Farooq college and the party would strongly support the college authorities and fight against the forces that were acting with hidden motive. “The allegation against the teacher is baseless. Many eminent personalities across the state had issued similar statements in the past and not a single case was registered against them for remarks,” he pointed out.
 
 
 
 
 Kunhalikutty said India was a secular country and people have freedom to express their opinion on religion. “The party will not agree with the legal action against the teacher for only expressing his views on dress code,” he opined.
