NEW DELHI: The tenth season the   has come to an end, and with that its time to sift through the numbers and pick the most valuable XI of 2017. Though four overseas players are allowed, such was the performance of some of the Indian players - capped and uncapped - in getting their respective franchises into the play-offs that a fourth foreigner was not needed. 

 
 
  (14 innings, 641 runs @ 58.27, SR 141.81, HS 126, 4x50)
 
 It was another prolific tournament for the aggressive left-hander, who with successive seasons with over 600 runs became the second player to do so in the IPL, and he also became the first overseas player to score 4,000 runs in the league. The Australian vice-captain led defending champions Sunrisers Hyderabad in the play-offs with a league-leading 604 runs from 13 matches, and in the Eliminator was cut short on 37 when he looked good for more. 
 
 Warner's best innings was 126 off 59 balls to set up a 48-run win over Kolkata Knight Riders, which demonstrated his amazing ability to offset a very fine bowling attack with repeated reverse-sweeps. Equally crucial were his restrained efforts on tough surfaces, when batting out overs was the key to victory. Sample the unbeaten 70 off 54 balls he made on a tacky Uppal surface, where his team beat KXIP by five runs, and the 69 not out from 52 deliveries in SRH's must-win final league match against Gujarat Lions. He scored the most runs in the Powerplay (295) of all batsmen; the joint most sixes (26); his strike-rate was the sixth-best for batsmen with over 350 runs; and only   hit more fifties than his four.
  
  
 
 
 
  (16 innings, 395 runs @ 24.68, SR 134.81, HS 70, 2x50)
 
 The top-scorer for the franchise that won the title, his contributions cannot be overlooked. Made just two fifties but consistently provided Mumbai Indians starts along with Jos Buttler, until the Englishman returned home and Lendl Simmons stepped in. These punchy innings helped Mumbai end the league stage at the top, and when you consider how underwhelming Rohit Sharma was, and how Nitish Rana trailed off following an amazing but brief burst, Parthiv's contributions to Mumbai's third title were critical. 
 
 His best of 70 came in the tied match against Gujarat which Mumbai won in the one-over eliminator, and his 52 was the highest score of Mumbai's 142/9 in defeat to RPS in Qualifier 1. 
  
  
 
 
 
  (15 innings, 472 runs @ 39.33, SR 121.96, HS 84*, 3x50)
 
 Captain of the team that made a stunning run into the play-offs, followed by a big win to reach the final in their second season of the IPL. In the final, his 51 off 50 balls kept Pune afloat until a stunning final over by Mitchell Johnson bowled Mumbai to a one-run win. Until then, Smith was a dependable No 3 and smart captain, making good use of his limited resources and along with MS Dhoni's inputs, marshaled the team excellently after a shaky start to the season. His runs were important, comfortably the most for Pune. Smith started and ended Pune's campaign with fifties, the second one so nearly delivering the franchise the title - he fell off the third ball of the last over with a shot that looked set to go for six.

 Before the season began, Uthappa spoke of having finally settled into the batting mode which best suits him, and that KKR's fans would see an improved batsman. Batted primary at No 3, he lost out on the advantage of batting in the Powerplay on most occasions but what was evident from the outset was Uthappa's quicker scoring rate: 26 off 16 balls, 68 off 39, 72 off 48, 87 off 47, 59 off 33 and 53 off 28 until he was sidelined by injury. After nine games, KKR topped the points table and that had a lot to do with Uthappa and Gautam Gambhir, who in successive matches put on partnerships of 100-plus versus RPS and Daredevils. Uthappa's 47-ball 87 against RPS was particularly aggressive, and showcased his range of strokes. His wicketkeeping wasn't always tidy - it is not easy keeping to Sunil Narine, Kuldeep Yadav and Piyush Chawla - but he was good enough to finish with the most dismissals (15) and in one match effected three stumpings. 
  
  
 
 
 
 (316 runs @ 31.60, SR 142.98, HS 103*, 12 wickets, Econ 7.18)
 The England allrounder, who at Rs 14.5 crore became the most expensive overseas purchase ever, averaged 31 with the bat and took 12 wickets while striking every 22 deliveries. Critically, Stokes shrugged off a poor start to the season by claiming three Man-of-the-Match awards to propel RPS into the play-offs. He first helped snap Mumbai Indian's six-game winning streak with 2/21, which featured a wicket-maiden fifth over and match-turning 19th, and then his clever variations against RCB fetched him 3/18 in four overs as RPS moved further up the table. After a brief injury lay-off, Stokes marked his return to the playing XI with a maiden T20 century, 103 not out off 63 balls to deliver a final-over win over Gujarat after RPS had slumped to 10/3. And while Jaydev Unadkat walked away with the match honours in a last-over win against SRH, Stokes' contribution was 39 off 25 balls - the highest score of Pune's innings - three wickets and two catches. His fielding too was excellent, with acrobatic leaps and smart catching eliciting praise from Smith.

 How does a batsman who hit just one fifty fit into this XI, you ask? Because, repeatedly, and from various positions, Tiwary delivered cameos that made a huge difference. Tiwary was Pune's secret weapon down the order, repeatedly striking crucial blows in hugely valuable cameos - and all at superb strike-rates. His first innings was an unbeaten 40 off 23 balls - just two dots - that helped RPS to 163/6, though it went in vain. Now sample Tiwari's contributions to victories. His 11-ball 27 (strike-rate 245.45 on a slow track) versus RCB from the No 7 spot proved the exact margin of victory, and Tiwary hitting Shane Watson for three fours and a six in the 19th over was pivotal. MS Dhoni walked away with all the plaudits after blasting RPS to a last-ball win against SRH, but subtract Tiwari's unbeaten 17 off eight balls in that nail-biter and the result may have been very different. In the three-run win over Mumbai Indians, his 22 off 13 balls was significant and on another sluggish Pune surface, his 44 not out off 35 balls helped fashion a winning total against RCB. Top-scored in RPS' last league match with 60 and then in Qualifier 1 with 58, the latter a match-winning innings. 
  
  
 
 
 
  (11 innings, 243 runs @ 34.71, SR 135.75, HS 47, 10 wkts, Econ 6.92)
 
 Despite missing three games with an injured shoulder, Krunal was a consistent performer for Mumbai Indians with 243 runs at a strike-rate of 135.75 and 10 wickets with an economy of 6.82. His two three-wicket hauls were match-winning: the wickets of Gautam Gambhir, Uthappa and Yusuf Pathan to reign in KKR and then a career-best 3/1, which encompassed a staggering 16 dot balls, against Gujarat Lions in a match that went into a one-over eliminator. His batting was crucial to Mumbai's strong lower middle order, never more so than in the final when he top-scored with 47 to drag a failing innings to 129/8. Other key contributions that helped the franchise top the league were his 37 off 20 balls against SRH, 37* off 30 versus RCB after a collapse to 7/4 and 29 off 20 against Gujarat - all in victories. 
  
  
 
 
 
 (12 matches, 16 wickets @ 12.31, SR 12, Econ 6.12)
 
 Purchased for Rs 1 crore at February's player auction (from a base price of 30 lakh), spin-bowling allrounder Negi emerged as RCB's leading bowler with 16 wickets at an average of 12.31, conceding runs at just 6.12 an over which was the lowest of the tournament. Given the ball up front, during and at the back end of innings, Negi consistently provided breakthroughs. Among his best performances were 1/21 in four overs when opening the bowling against Gujarat; 2/17 in four against Mumbai Indians; 1/12 in three versus RPS; 2/3 in the one over he bowled against Delhi in Bangalore, which was the last of the match when 18 needed to be defended; and 3/10 as RCB won their last match, also against Delhi. Negi's lower-order batting was far from spectacular, but 144 runs at a strike-rate of 129.72 were decent. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  (14 matches, 26 wickets @ 14.19, SR 12, Econ 7.05)
 
 There was really nothing more Warner could have asked from Bhuvneshwar, whose bowling was controlling and nagging. He claimed the purple cap for the second season running, grabbing it early in the competition and never letting go. As expected, Bhuvneshwar was excellent up front and at the death for SRH, taking a wicket every 12 balls and finishing with a very good economy rate. His early form put SRH at the top of the points table and his consistency helped them stay in the top four. His career-best 5/19 was one for the IPL annals. 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  (12 matches, 24 wickets @ 13.41, SR 11.4, Econ 7.02)
 
 Unadkat finished second on the IPL bowling chart with 24 wickets in 12 games for RPS, striking every 11.4 deliveries while conceding runs at 7.02 per over. The 25-year-old spearheaded Pune's bowling once Ashok Dinda was dropped early in the competition, with several key performances including two Man-of-the-Match showings - a career-best 5/30 highlighted by a hat-trick in a maiden last over versus RSH, and 2/12 to go with a direct hit run-out and fine diving catch as RPS clinched second spot and knocked out KXIP. Another significant display came against Mumbai Indians, when he defended 17 off the final over while taking two wickets. Unadkat's ability to hold his nerve and bowl accurately at the death was instrumental in Pune's surge into the play-offs. Took 1/24 in Qualifier 1 and 2/19 in the final, a fine effort that should have contributed to RPS winning the championship. 
  
  
 
 
 
  (12 matches, 18 wickets @ 20.50, SR 15.6, Econ 7.85)
 
 A late inclusion in the league after he was overlooked at February's player auction, Tahir underlined his status as the top-ranked bowler in T20Is with a very fine season for Pune - one that was cut short when he flew home to South Africa for international duty. His legspin was the shining force for the franchise while it struggled in the first few weeks, and it was no coincidence that their stunning spike in form wore Tahir's imprint. During Pune's hat-trick of wins around the half-way mark of  , Tahir claimed seven wickets at an economy rate of 6.75, of which five were proper batsmen. His rocking-baby celebrations and frenzied, uncoordinated runs around the ground after taking wickets made for fun viewing to spectators, but it was his brand of legspin which proved immensely valuable to a franchise who morphed from downbeat to genuine title contenders.
 
  
  
 
 
 
  (6 matches, 12 wickets @ 11.75, SR 10.5, Econ 6.71)
 
 A dislocated left shoulder curtailed Tye's season when it promised to delivery much more, but in his brief time in the league, the Australian pace bowler proved the biggest asset to Gujarat and was fun to watch. Made his IPL debut with a five-wicket haul which encompassed a hat-trick, then soared to second in the bowling charts in no time. Tye's second Man-of-the-Match award came in a seven-wicket win over RCB in which he had figures of 3/12 in four overs and was on a hat-trick again with the wickets of Chris Gayle and Travis Head. With a strike-rate of 10.5 and economy rate of 6.71, Tye was one of the best bowlers in the league until his injury. Gujarat sorely missed him thereafter.
