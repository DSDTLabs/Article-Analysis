GREATER NOIDA: An outfit calling itself ‘Gau Raksha Dal’ on Friday forced meat shops to shut down in Greater Noida, a day after vigilantes from fringe groups had done the same in Gurgaon.

 The Greater Noida outfit claimed it had petitioned the district administration and Badalpur police station last month to stop meat sales during   but decided to go ahead and do it itself when it received no response.
 
 Ved Nagar, who identified himself as president of the outfit, said, “The administration and police did not take any action on our complaint. So I personally led a group of members and shut down some shops in the neighbourhood. The   owners should respect religious sentiments of people.” Even fish and egg shops were forced to close. After that, fearing vandalism, many more meat and fish sellers decided to shut shop voluntarily. 
 
 Police said they will take action against the outfit. Suniti, SP (rural) Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “Any outfit can’t shut down shops arbitrarily. We have also sensitised local intelligence units to report such matters if they get information. We will take action against people creating any such issue.” SHOs have also been asked to ensure law and order is not compromised anywhere, she said.
