MAPUSA: The elections to the post of sarpanch and deputy sarpanch of Anjuna-Caisua panchayat had to be adjourned after the presiding officer had to be hospitalized following his sickness. The other two panchayats in Bardez, which were due to elect sarpanch and deputy sarpanch elected them unopposed.

 Sources said the presiding officer to conduct the elections fell sick and was hospitalized. The block development office of Bardez was informed and the new presiding officer was sent to conduct the elections. Sources said that at the panchayat, all the 11 members were present. Some of the members raised objection that it was late to conduct the elections as the time, in the notice served to them, had lapsed. There could not be a consensus among the newly-elected panchayat members and the new presiding officer took the decision to adjourn the election. Sources said that the new dates for the election will be decided by the directorate of panchayats.
 
 “The sarpanch election was deliberately stalled with the help of political influence. The presiding officer was also hands-in-glove with them. We will file a complaint against him to the appropriate authority. The new presiding officer had reached the panchayat by 10.50am. All the 11 elected members were present. I don’t understand what was the need to adjourn the elections,” panchayat member   said.
 
 Sitting deputy sarpanch   holds the edge in forming the panchayat panel. Sources said that Almeida has seven members with him to form the panchayat.
 
 In Bastora panchayat, the panel supported by MLA Glenn Ticlo elected   and   as sarpanch and deputy sarpanch unopposed. In Penha de Franca panchayat, Swapnil Chodankar and Manisha Naik were elected as sarpanch and deputy sarpanch unopposed.
