CHENNAI: When Shyam, a resident of Kasturba Nagar First Main Road, spotted numerous traffic violations in his vicinity, he approached the local police for help. But the police snubbed him. 

 “I was told to mind my business,” said Shyam, who shared his bitter experience among a group of   residents at the inaugural  .
 
 Like-minded Adyar residents fed up with inaction of Greater Chennai Corporation, Metrowater, city police and electricity board, gathered at the Youth Hostel in Indira Nagar on Sunday to discuss and find solutions to civic issues. Times Connect, an initiative by The Times of India, provided them a platform to air   directly to officials.
 
 While Adyar range deputy commissioner of police (law and order), Rohit Nathan, participated and took note of the problems, city corporation officials skipped the event.
 
 Kamakshi Subramaniyan, a nonagenarian activist from Besant Nagar, was vocal in her criticism of regional deputy commissioner (south) S Gopala Sundara Raj. “The RDC is never available over phone,” she said adding that Besant Nagar’s Second Avenue had become a haven for encroachers, but the corporation and police keep on passing the buck.
 
 Ganesan, a resident of Indira Nagar, told the Adyar   that Second Avenue Road in Indira Nagar has turned into a bus parking bay. “Buses of tech companies and colleges park for free. The police never ask questions,” he said. 
 
 The DCP replied that the issue was a grey area not covered under the law. “There is no law that explicitly prohibits parking in an unregulated zone,” Nathan said and urged residents to approach their local MLAs in order to bring about a change.
 
  “Civic issues like encroachment have been on the backburner for the corporation for a while because the local body elections have not been conducted. To achieve a sustainable solution, intervention has to happen at the higher levels,” Nathan said.
