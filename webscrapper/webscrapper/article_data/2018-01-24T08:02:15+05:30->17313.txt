CHENNAI: On the one hand, the   ( ) in Chennai is trying to increase ordinary bus services in core city areas to silence the public outrage against the steep hike in bus fares, while on the other, complaints relating to reduction of all types of services in the suburbs have been left unattended for months.

 The number of MTC buses connecting Mamallapuram and Thiruporur with core areas like Adyar, Guindy and   has almost halved. The   government too has increased bus fares of   buses plying to Chennai. Now, a one-way journey from Puducherry to Chennai via Mamallapuram costs ₹145 in ordinary buses and ₹315 in AC buses. Earlier, PRTC charged ₹100 for ordinary buses and ₹210 for super deluxe buses.
 
 “This is a double whammy for ECR residents. Unlike other interior areas where trains have come to the rescue after the bus fare hike, people residing here are left with no other option but to pay what the government buses demand,” said R Kumaresan of Nemmeli.
 
 As far as MTC services on this stretch are concerned, AC buses were introduced in 2011. However, of late, the frequency of these buses has come down by about 5%, causing inconvenience to not only residents but also tourists, he added. Thiruporur residents complained that the number of MTC buses to Koyambedu (route no. 566) was reduced from 12 to seven. Earlier, six buses were plying from here to Kundrathur on route no. 570. Now, only four buses are operating, say residents.
 
 An MTC official said the passenger traffic on these uneconomical routes was less during non-peak hours and so those buses were diverted to Tambaram, T Nagar and   railway station. Hundreds of daily wage labourers in and around these places are now dependent on private share-autos to reach the city.
