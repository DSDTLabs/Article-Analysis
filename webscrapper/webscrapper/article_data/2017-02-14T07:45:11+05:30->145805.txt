HOWRAH/KOLKATA: An accused in the Kalighat attempt to murder case -Dipak Singh -was nabbed from the New Delhi railway station by the   and later handed over to the Delhi GRP. A joint team from Kolkata and Howrah police has left for Delhi to bring him back. Police sources said Kalighat police tipped the RPF about Singh's movements. The city cops also reportedly alerted the RPF that he might be travelling in the pantry car.

 Howrah police said they prima facie suspect that Singh might have had a hand in the death of another accused  , who was found dead in a Howrah lodge on Sunday . On Saturday, he was accused of attacking Kalig hat trader Narendra Jain and his wife Sarala. Singh was reportedly present with Bordoi and attacked the Jains too.
 
 The Howrah police have decided to slap murder charges against Singh and take him in custody before   questions him. “We believe that besides poisoning Bordoi, he had even shot at him. The final post-mortem report may prove this. We are sending the viscera and hair samples and finger parts of Bordoi to FSL to ascertain the exact cause of death,“ said a senior Howrah police officer. An FSL team also inspected the hotel room in this regard.
 
 Kolkata Police said it now appears that Bordoi had lent money to his relative Narendra to place it on horse races. “Narendra had also probably borrowed from him to use the money in cricket betting.When Bordoi wanted back his money , arguments followed. Bordoi took the help of Singh and promised him money if he could loot the Jains' residence. But the duo did not expect the couple's daughter Udita would escape and inform police.As locals and cops rushed in, both Bordoi and Singh escaped,“ said police.
 
 “Later, Singh wanted his money .When Bordoi said he had no money, Singh probably murdered him,“ said police.
