SURAT: The   (URDCL), a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up for the execution of the project, has decided to borrow Rs 200 crore from open market for the construction of the 42-metre-wide road. Sale of commercial plots and floor space index (FSI) would help generate the balance amount for the Rs 5,100 crore project, expected to be fully complete in a decade. 

 Surat is estimated to have a population of 1.2 crore by 2041 and residential development on both sides of the outer ring road on the 27km stretch could release at least 2 lakh sq metre of space for development. “This space would suffice the need of the city at least till 2041,” a developer said. 
 
 “We are planning to borrow Rs 200 crore from open market to kick-start the development,” municipal commissioner   said. 
 
 “We expect town planning schemes to be completed within another two months. Thereafter, sale of commercial plot and extra saleable FSI up to 4 would become relatively easy,” a   officer said. 
 
 This outer ring road would provide a bypass to industries located at Hazira, link residential and commercial localities of Surat and   and make handling of heavy traffic of   easier.
 
 Surat-Navsari-Bardoli would be developed as multiple cities by the authorities concerned by 2041. 
 
 Major educational institutions would be located in Navsari. Thus, this infrastructure would go a long way in allowing a smoother passage between these connected cities.
