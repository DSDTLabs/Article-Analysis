MUMBAI: A   expert’s report helped the police nail businessman Rajesh Nakhua’s lie. Nakhua had allegedly forged a relative’s signature on documents to dupe her of her gold ornaments worth Rs 3 crore.

 The police said that Rajesh Nakhua alias Bhanusali (40) and two others—Mira Chandan and Deepak Bhanusali convinced the relative, Nutan Mange, to part with Rs 3 crore worth gold jewellery besides Rs 4 lakh as fees to hire a detective to keep tabs on her husband who was having an “extramarital affair”. The police said that Nakhua told Mange he had information about the income-tax department’s plan to carry out a raid and advised her to remove her jewellery from her bank locker and keep it with ‘safely’ him. 
 
 After many days, in September 2016, when there was no IT raid, Mange asked Nakhua to return the ornaments as she wanted to wear for a relative's wedding but he refused. He forged her signature on documents to show he had returned the ornaments. 
 
 Mange then lodged a complaint against him, following which he moved the court for anticipatory bail and also secured one. He also submitted a self-attested document showing Nutun’s signature stating that she has received all the ornaments from Nakhua. The letter which was handwritten in   had Nutun’s signature which she claimed was forged. 
 
 The city crime branch then sought a handwriting expert’s opinion from the forensic science laboratory. “The expert gave an opinion that Nutun’s signature was forged. We submitted the report to the Bombay high court for cancellation of Nakhua’s anticipatory bail. Following which, the bail was rejected.” said a senior police officer. The police said that Nakhua had been lying and hence, they wanted his custodial interrogation.
 
 Nakhua, who runs a detective agency and customs clearing agency, was arrested and booked for  , forgery and breach of trust. He has been sent to police custody till April 3.
