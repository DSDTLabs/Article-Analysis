PATNA: Dismissing speculations that chief minister (CM)   is shifting to national politics in Delhi, the JD (U) on Friday said the party chief would be the   candidate of   in state assembly elections slated to be held in 2020.

 “There is no vacancy for CM post in   till 2025 and speculations around allotment of a bungalow in Lutyens’ Delhi to Nitish do not hold any relevance in state politics,” JD (U) general secretary   said.
 
 The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs recently allotted a top bracket bungalow at 6, K Kamraj Lane to the JD (U) chief, who rejoined the ruling NDA at the Centre after breaking ties with the RJD and the   in July last year.
 
 “Some people are fuelling rumours that Nitish ji has been allotted the bungalow in Delhi as he will be actively involved in national politics. Let there be no doubts, Nitish ji will continue to serve the people of Bihar,”   told TOI on Friday.
 
 Asked about the allotment of bungalow to Nitish in Delhi, Jha said, “The ministry of urban affairs has its own rules for allotting bungalows to every state and parliamentarians in the national capital.”
 
 As the railway minister in the NDA-I government from 2001 to 2004, Nitish had lived in one of the biggest bungalows on Akbar Road in Delhi.
 
 Earlier, leader of opposition in state assembly   Prasad Yadav had taken a dig at Nitish for fresh allotment of a bungalow to him in the national capital. “Nitish has been given a big bungalow in Delhi so that he can spend his time in the national capital as he doesn’t care about Bihar’s development,” Tejashwi had said on Wednesday.
