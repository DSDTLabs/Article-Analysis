GHAZIABAD: After missing several deadlines, the much-awaited   which connects Raj Nagar Extension to UP Gate is finally likely to be thrown open to traffic on Friday. Local BJP functionaries said that Uttar Pradesh chief minister   would attend the inauguration ceremony in   as the chief guest. 

 The 10.3km-long elevated road has been built to allow non-stop, direct movement of vehicles - which are not meant for Ghaziabad city - to travel from UP Gate on NH-24 till Raj Nagar Extension and vice-versa. The road is the longest flyway in India to be built on single-pier pillars.
 
 On Tuesday, the local unit of BJP in Ghaziabad held a meeting to chalk out preparations ahead of Yogi Adityanath's visit. According to party functionaries, an event will be organised on the Ram Leela grounds in Kavi Nagar where the chief minister will also address a public meeting.
 
 According to them, a number of other developmental works for Ghaziabad will also be announced by the UP chief minister during his visit to the city for the elevated road inauguration event.
 
 "We have been informed through our party channels, that the CM will reach Ghaziabad on March 30. Our preparations to make the event a grand success are already underway," said BJP city president  .
 
 However, the district administration said it was yet to get a confirmation from the CM's office. 
 
 "We have informed the office of the chief minister of UP for the tentative opening of the road on March 30. But we are yet to get a confirmation from Lucknow," Ghaziabad Development Authority vice-chairperson and district magistrate   told TOI. 
 
 The elevated road has missed several deadlines in the past owing to delay in clearances from various Union government departments, including the Indian Railways, for construction-related issues. The road has been built at a cost of Rs 1,470 crore over three years.
