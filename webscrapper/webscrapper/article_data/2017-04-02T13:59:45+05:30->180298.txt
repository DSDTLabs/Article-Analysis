 is undoubtedly the most happening beauty in the Tinsel town. With flooding offers from Kollywood, Mollywood and Tollywood, Keerthy has every reason to put out her conditions to the producers and she is sure making use of the opportunity.

 Keerthy debuted alongside legendary Mohanlal with 'Geethanjali' in Mollywood and ever since has been part of several productions which had senior/aged actors playing predominant roles. She also acted opposite Dileep in 'Ring Master'. 
 
 However, Keerthy has been receiving plum projects from the Tollywood industry and her two releases- 'Nenu Sailaja' and 'Nenu local' have proved box-office successes. With her career rising high, the Malayalee beauty decided to take her call and therefore has refrained from accepting roles that require her to star alongside senior actors. 
 
 Apparently, a source close to the actress revealed that Keerthy Suresh has turned down an opportunity that was offered to her, citing the same reason. Also, when she has many offers to pick from, why would she go for the ones which are alongside aged actors?
 
 Post success of 'Nenu local', Keerthy has hiked her remuneration and is keen on confining herself to movies that have young heroes in the main lead.
 
 Anyhow, we got to know that Keerthy is sure striking the right balance and knows her game.
