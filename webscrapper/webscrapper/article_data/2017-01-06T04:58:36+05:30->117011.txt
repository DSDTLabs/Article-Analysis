CHENNAI: Sabhas going all out to attract celebrated artistes for their prime slots in the December music season are simultaneously nurturing young talent by nominating aspiring musicians to display their gifts at the Times Thyagaraja Awards. In its sixth edition this year, the run-up to the award function saw a lively audition over four days from January 2 at Rajarathinam Kalai Arangam in RA Puram.

 About 50 participants nominated by sabhas such as Sri Purandaradasar Trust, Narada Gana Sabha and   presented kritis during the four days and were judged by Aruna Ranganathan, Sub hashini   and Bhushany Kalyanaraman.On all four days, the auditions ended with star performances by Ambi Subramaniam, Trichur Brothers, Shobana Vignesh and O S Arun. About eight artists will o battle it out at the grand finale on January 21 at the Music Academy.
 
 Samavitha G Sasidharan, who presented the beautiful kriti   in  , expressed excitement at being provided a stage to perform her favourite raga. “You will not know where you stand and how much there is to learn unless you share the stage with other young musicians. This audition inspired me to keep learning and also perform to my best,“ she said.
 
 “The idea of having sixminute time slots for each participant made it like a concert in a capsule. They had to sing the raga alapana, a part of the song and the swara,“ said Parthasarathy.
 
 “Also, the fact that participants could choose the songs and ragas of their choice put them at ease and made the competition healthy. It was very unlike the stress and pressure one witnesses in such competitions on television,“ he added.
