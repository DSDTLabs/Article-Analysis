THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Not sending the list of police officers for getting the medals from the   was a   on the part of the state government, opposition leader   said on Wednesday. 

 "It is nothing but a shameful failure. The file with the list of the names was kept in the chief minister's office for two weeks," said Chennithala. He said this was the first time that the police officers from the state were not getting the opportunity to receive the much respected medals. "I believe this is due to the ongoing tiff between top   and IPS officers in the state. It has to be suspected that it was purposefully delayed so that the police officers will not get the medals," he alleged. 
 
 As per the details, it is learnt that in September the Union home ministry had asked the state government to submit the details of the police officers.
 
  Usually, the home secretary is sent to New Delhi with the list for finalising the names of the awardees. This time the Centre had asked the state government to send the list before October 6. But the list was sent only during December last week, said Ramesh. 
 
 On ensuring peace in the politically sensitive Kannur district, the   said the government has failed to ensure the service of senior police officers in the region. Even though the government had posted Rajesh Diwan as the new north zone ADGP he is not willing to take up the post since he is in the DGP rank. 
 
 Mahipal Yadav has been appointed as the Kannur range IG but he has not taken charge since he is on election duty in Punjab and will be back only by March. Hence in Kannur, a hotbed of political violence, there are no senior officials, he said.
