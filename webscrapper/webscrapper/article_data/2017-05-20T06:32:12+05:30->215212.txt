MEERUT:  , an organisation which in 2016 claimed to have had 15,000 men in its ranks to fight the  , has now claimed that Hindus in India are at risk from “ever-increasing numbers of Muslims” and that it should be controlled.
 
  “Hindus will be outnumbered by 2050 and swallowed alive,” the organization said at a pres conference here on Friday, demanding that the government announce a stringent population control policy that stipulates two children per family.
  
  "The number of Hindus is going down. We are being threatened with extinction. No government has made any policy to deal with this problem,” said Narsingh Anand, secretary, Hindu Swabhiman.
  
  As reported by TOI, the organisation had in 2016 claimed that it was raising its own militia to fight the “imminent” threat from  . It said around 15,000 men were being trained in several camps around Western UP. Hindu Swabhiman now claims that more training camps are in operation and several more men have joined their ranks.
  
  “Many more people have joined the camps, where we train them in using lathis and swords. Self-defence is necessary as we face several threats from enemies who are outside our borders and many who are within our borders. Sometimes, the police and the Army are not enough, and we have to be prepared on our own,” said Chetna Sharma, national president, Hindu Swabhiman.
  
  Sharma added, “Someone had suggested that there should be a law where families with more than two children cannot get government jobs. We need a strict law like in China, where having more than two children is punished. And this should apply to all, not just Muslims. Till such time, Hindus should have at least five children,” she said.
