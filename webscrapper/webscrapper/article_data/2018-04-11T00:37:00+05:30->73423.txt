NEW DELHI: A notorious vehicle lifter, who used to travel all the way from   and wait outside banks or markets in Delhi to identify his favourite vehicle and then steal them with a master key, was arrested from   on Tuesday.

 Mohammad Imran, who stole more than 500 vehicles from Delhi alone, was caught when he was fleeing with a stolen motorcycle. Police said that he has been evading arrest for the past nine years.
 
 Police officers said that it would take him only 20 seconds to unlock a vehicle. Imran was caught on the   by a police team that had set up a barricade to check vehicles. “Imran tried to flee after being flagged down, but was caught after a chase. He later admitted that he had stolen 12 vehicles in the past few days,” said a police officer.
 
 Imran told police that he used to steal motorcycles particularly from outside banks and commercial areas to avoid suspicion and then unlock or break the lock of the vehicle to switch on the ignition.
 
 He used to come to Delhi or   by bus from Meerut and go back on the stolen vehicle. If he managed to steal more than one vehicle any day, he would park one of them at a metro station and leave with the other. Later, he would return to take it. Next day he used to come to take the stolen bike from the parking site.
 
 Officers said that Imran managed to evade arrest for the past nine years since he did not have any accomplice who would give away his identity nor did he sell the bike to a known dealer. He usually dismantled the vehicle himself and sold them as scrap to avoid being detected.
 
 Police said that they would contact each of the police stations under whose jurisdiction vehicle thefts were reported and link them with his claims. His recievers in Meerut too, would be tracked for questioning.
