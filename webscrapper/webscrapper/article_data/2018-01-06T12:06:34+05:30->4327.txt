BHUBANESWAR: A day after schoolteacher   was found murdered in   district,   police on Friday detained two suspects for questioning. Police were yet to get any clue about the motive behind the murder. 

 Dehury's body was found in a paddy field near her school on Thursday. Her face and head were brutally smashed leading to her death, police said. "We are interrogating two persons because we suspect their complicity in the crime. As of now we are not sure about the motive of the murder," superintendent of police (Khurda)   told TOI. 
 
 Police sources said one of the suspects is a family member of Dehury's landlord, who had given her his house on rent at  . "We suspect she was killed by one of her acquaintances," another police officer said. 
 
 Dehury's family said a youth of Badapokharia had unsuccessfully wooed her for marriage recently. "We have informed police about it. She was being harassed by the youth and his friends. She recently told me that she no longer wanted to stay in the village," said Prafulla, Dehury's uncle. 
 
 Her uncle said she was also disturbed over family dispute in the house of her landlord. "Though she was staying on rent, she was very much attached to the landlord's family. She often took her food at their house. For the past few weeks, she was upset due to some problems in the family," Prafulla said. 
 
 Students of   upper primary school, where Dehury was posted for the past one year, staged a demonstration on the school premises and demanded immediate arrest of the accused. Teachers of Khurda district also took out a peaceful candlelight rally in Khurda condemning her brutal killing.
 
 "We are yet to come out of the shock of her loss. She did not have any enmity with anyone. Police should expeditiously probe the matter and arrest her killer or killers," said the school's headmaster, Bibhuti Ranjan Panigrahi.
