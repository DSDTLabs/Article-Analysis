CHENNAI: Continuing last year’s decision of not announcing ranks and toppers of board exams, Tamil Nadu’s   on Saturday reiterated that all schools must comply with the same instructions this year as well.

 
 Earlier, the government would recognise the top three ranks in the state. But last year, the government decided to do away with announcement of ranks for Class X and XII board exams and this year it will apply to Class XII board exams too. The decision had been taken to prevent unhealthy competition and promotion among schools leading to stress for students. It had also been scrapped due to the fad over producing state toppers that was leading to rote learning in certain schools.
 
 School education secretary   sent out instructions to all chief education officers across the state that all schools must follow the orders strictly. The officers have been directed to initiate action against schools which promote rank holders or advertise them using flex banners and posters outside school premises.
