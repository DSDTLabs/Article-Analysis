LUDHIANA:   Agricultural University ( ) has been granted patent on “A fermentation process for preparation of concentrated sugarcane vinegar” by the  , government of India, New Delhi. 

 The patent has been granted for a period of 20 years from the date of filing (March 16, 2011) in accordance with the provisions of the Patent’s Act, 1970, on January 22, 2018. This is the third Indian patent granted to PAU. 
 
 This patented process was invented by GS  , senior microbiologist, and his master’s student, Nishu Joshi from the department of microbiology, PAU. According to Kocher, the low acetic acid (5-6% w/v) sugarcane vinegar when transported in bulk results in high transportation cost. However, the present invention stresses optimization of a submerged fermentation-cum-freeze concentration process for producing concentrated sugarcane vinegar having an acetic acid strength of ≈16% w/v. This invention will provide concentrated sugarcane vinegar, thus, reducing its storage volume, transportation cost as well as 18% GST (which is charged on volume of export/transport). Besides, the frozen concentrated vinegar is reported to provide better sensory quality to the product than non-concentrated processes.
 
 Shammi Kapoor, head, department of microbiology, said sugarcane is an important cash crop of Punjab and the developed technology will help farmers of the state in adopting a business venture on concentrated vinegar from sugarcane.
 
 Baldev Singh Dhillon, vice-chancellor, PAU; Navtej Bains, director of research; and  , director of extension education, congratulated Kocher and his student for the achievement.
