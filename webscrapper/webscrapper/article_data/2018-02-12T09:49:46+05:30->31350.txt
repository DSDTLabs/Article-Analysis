LUCKNOW: Even though UP   core team will sit on Monday to discuss possible candidates for   and   bypolls, prominent BJP leaders have started throwing their weight behind candidates of their choice.

 Speculation is on on how much say will chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya have in the selection of candidates for the seats vacated by them. The name of some family member of deputy CM Maurya is also doing rounds for Phulpur seat.
 
 Since the constituency is dominated by OBC caste voters, primarily Patels, Mauryas and Kushwahas, BJP is most like to field some OBC leader. Deputy CM was keen to field his son but since age is not on the latter’s side, a section of leaders claimed that Maurya now wants to field his wife. However, Maurya himself denies wanting to field any of his family members.
 
 The party may choose some other candidate, since sources within said that it is very unlikely that any member of Maurya’s family would contest from Phulpur.
 
 In Gorakhpur, while Yogi supporters are of firm belief that the candidate will be of CM’s choice since he has represented the constituency for five times, party leaders claimed that the organisation would take the last call.
 
 Still, sources said that if BJP selects a candidate, it would certainly have Yogi’s assent or if Yogi chooses a candidate it would be with party’s consent. Still, several names are doing rounds in Gorakhpur.
 
 Some claim that Swami Kamalnath could be a choice, yet others say Swami Chinmayanand could be fielded. Name of businessman Arunesh Shahi is also doing rounds and last but not the least, name of Harishanker Tiwari’s nephew and former chairman of Legislative Council Ganesh Pandey is also among the probables. A senior BJP leader said that many names are under consideration and the candidate would be a party worker and added that Yogi Adityanath would back party’s choice.
