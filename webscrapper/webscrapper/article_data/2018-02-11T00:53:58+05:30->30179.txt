CHENNAI: Time is running out for   (CCFC). The V Soundararajan-coached side, which is on a seven-game winless run, is eighth on the table with 12 points from 14 matches. With four matches remaining, including two games at home, CCFC need to start winning in order to avoid relegation.

 
 No wonder then that Soundararajan said that the side will go all out for a victory when they take on   in the   at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Coimbatore on Sunday. "The aim is to win the game at any cost. We are going to go all out. The strategy is not to give Lajong an inch of space to operate. We have two home matches and we need to secure six points," Soundararajan said ahead of the match.
 
 What has hurt CCFC is their poor home record. They haven't been able to win any of their seven matches at home so far and have struggled consistently to score goals. In fact, their only two wins have come at away grounds. To add to their woes, the form of their French forward Jean Michel Joachim, who has scored five goals, had dipped drastically and others have failed to step up in the attacking third. As a result, CCFC have scored just once in their last seven games. "We have not performed poorly and have been creating chances. But the problem has been converting them. In our last match against  , we tried a combination of two strikers - Joachim and Aleksander. Still, we couldn't get a goal," Soundararajan said.
 
 CCFC will miss their goalkeeper Uros Poljanec due to a head injury. Meanwhile, Shillong Lajong, which succumbed to three consecutive losses against Mohun Bagan, Minerva Punjab and   and are fifth on the table, will also be looking to bounce back. "Playing away is always difficult. We have not been consistent so far but tomorrow is a different match at a different venue. We will go all-out for three points," said coach Alison Kharsyntiew.
