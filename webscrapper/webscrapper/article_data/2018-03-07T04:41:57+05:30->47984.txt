MUMBAI: The state government has so far disbursed loan waiver amounts to 37 lakh farmers, revenue minister   said in the legislative council on Tuesday. 

 Replying to a discussion on the Governor's address to the legislature, Patil said details were available online for every district, taluka and village. He said eight lakh farmers whose loan amount is over Rs 1.5 lakh could negotiate the amount over and above that with banks.
 
 On delay in disbursing amounts, Patil said it had taken 18 months even in 2008-09.
 
 On no public hearing being held for construction of the Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial in the Arabian Sea, Patil said the condition had been waived for public projects by the Centre and state. On investments through 'Make in  ', he said of the Rs 8 lakh cr worth MoUs signed, actual investments were Rs 4 lakh cr. Opposition leader in the council said the industry department had told him under RTI that investments worth Rs 37,000 cr had been made so far.
