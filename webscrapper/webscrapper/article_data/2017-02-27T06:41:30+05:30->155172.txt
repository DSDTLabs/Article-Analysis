MUMBAI:   resident Mohammed Hanif Nalkhande spent his life's savings to fund his five-member family's Haj last year. But the private tour operator ( ), which arranged his travel to Saudi Arabia, recently charged him Rs 14,000 per pilgrim. The tour operator said he wanted to recover the service tax the government had levied on Haj operations last year. “I am in a fix. Why should I pay the service tax for Haj which I performed in the past," says Nalkhande. Nalkhande is joining hands with several pilgrims to petition the   against the government's decision to charge 9% service tax on PTOs who arrange Haj travel. The   (AIHUTOA) is also intervening in an earlier petition by a pilgrim against the tax. Both pilgrims and the association are protesting against the tax on a pilgrimage which is purely a religious ceremony.

 They are protesting also as pilgrims who travel through the Haj panel (1.25 lakh) have been exempted from paying the tax while those choosing private operators (45,000) are being charged. “Whether one goes through the   or a tour operator, the purpose is to perform Haj. Both kinds of pilgrims perform the same rituals,“ said Ansari Mehmood Pervaiz, a retired school principal, and a petitioner.“I am utilizing my pension to fund my Haj, which was to cost around Rs 3 lakh. If I have to pay service tax, the cost will increase by Rs27,000. Where will I get this extra amount from?“ asked Pervaiz.
 
 Pune-based Dr Sarfraz Memon plans to go for Haj along with his ailing son and was shocked when his tour operator told him he may have to pay the tax too.
