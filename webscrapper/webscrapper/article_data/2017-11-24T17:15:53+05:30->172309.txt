Many schools in India start accepting kids who are as young as 2.5 years but that age bracket is no indication of your child being ready for school. 

 A lot of parents in India mull over this topic time and again - the right age to start schooling. It is because there are a lot of researches that suggest children should not start   very early. Now, a recent   reiterates the theory.
 
 A recent study conducted by Stanford University has established that parents who waited to enroll their kids in kindergarten by age 6 (and not 5) had better performing kids. The kids had better test scores and better self-control by the time they reached 7 and 11 years.
 
 Psychologists see self-control as an executive function. They feel it is in the initial years when kids start to possess this quality. Kids with a strong level of executive function are able to manage their time better and focus even with distractions. 
 
 According to a Business Insider article, in the latest study , investigators Thomas Dee and Hans Henrik Sievertsen used the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) study to collect their data. The DNBC included responses from 54,241 parents on measures of mental health when their children were 7 years old and 35,902 responses when the kids were 11.
