BENGALURU: The governor’s office has directed the   (RGUHS), which is already probing the fake marks card and  , to look into alleged fake receipts   and submit a report.

 Sources in the university said the governor’s office wrote last week asking for a report based on a complaint that at least Rs 45 lakh has been “swindled” by issuing   even when RGUHS did not receive those deposits. “It could run into crores of rupees but the complainant has attached multiple receipts totalling to over Rs 45 lakh,” a source said.
 
 A confirmation on whose names these receipts have been issued or if there was any evidence to prove insiders’ involvement was not available immediately.
 
 RGUHS vice-chancellor M K Ramesh, said: “It is an anonymous complaint. Even we had received the same complaint and I had already forwarded the same to the section concerned.” He ,however, could not confirm if the money involved was Rs 45 lakh. 
 
 Ramesh said there was no confirmation or evidence to prove the allegations so far and that a report will be submitted to the governor.
 
 “It is too premature now to make the names in the complaint public. The complaint does not name any individual official from RGUHS, even as it infers that there’s insider involvement,” sources said.
