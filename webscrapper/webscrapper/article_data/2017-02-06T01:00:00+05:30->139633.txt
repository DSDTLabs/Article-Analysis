Actor  , who made his   debut with 'Love Sex Aur Dhokha' and followed it up with films like 'Yeh Hai Bakrapur' and 'Chauranga', has now turned producer. His banner, First Ray Films, is all set to release India’s first social media-based whodunit, 'mona_darling', directed by Shashi Sudigala. 
First Ray Films is an extension of Jha’s theatre company, First Ray Theatre Group, known for the Indian Adaptation of David Gieselmann’s 'Mr Kolpert' and Girish Karnad’s 'Bali'. 
 Kailash Kulkarni, one of the partners at the production house, says, “I have followed Anshuman’s work on stage for the past decade. He doesn’t own a house in Mumbai and drives a simple car. However, he has managed to get together people to form a company and produce a multi-crore film.” 
 Anshuman’s tryst with theatre began when he was 14. A year later, he made his stage debut at Prithvi Theatre. The Delhi boy got a diploma in acting from   when he was 17 and has worked with veterans like Quasar Padamsee, Joy Fernandes and Jaimini Pathak. 
 Vashu Bhagnani, whose banner Pooja Films is presenting the thriller, says “Anshuman is one of the finest young actors we have. He has a mature understanding of scripts and cinema.” 
 Actor  , who has worked with him in 'Chauranga', says, “Producing is a huge responsibility and for him to have put this together and release it within 10 months is no mean feat.”
 The 30-year-old, who has three releases lined up in 2017 as an actor — Nandita Das’ 'Pagla Ghoda', 'Angrezi Mein Kehte Hain' with Sanjai Mishra and Academy award-nominee Ashvin Kumar’s 'Noor', says, “Theatre is my lifeline as an actor. I’m chasing a purpose, not riches. Our intent will be to back high-concept scripts and make them with the best possible crew. 'mona_darling' is the first step in that journey.”
