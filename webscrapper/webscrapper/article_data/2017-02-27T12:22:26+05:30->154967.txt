INDORE: In a first of its kind stray dogs’ adoption camp in the state, Indoreans came forward to show their love for man’s best friend. Several   turned up to adopt these dogs too.

 Even as the focus of the   was on certified breeds worth lakhs of rupees, there was a group of people who stole the show with their generous move of taking strays home.
 
 At the camp put up by an NGO, several homeless strays were adopted.
 
 “I am so happy that we have been approached by so many people who wanted to enquire about adopting  . It is very important to make people aware about it and we are working towards it,” said Rimjhim Joshi, an animal rights activist and volunteer at the NGO.
 
 On learning about the initiative put up for the adoption of orphaned dogs, many young dog lovers in the city even brought dogs that they had been taking care of around their houses with the hopes of finding permanent homes for them.
 
 This was the first time that dog show organisers maintained a special stall on the prevention of cruelty to animals while promoting adoption of desi dogs.
 
 Shobhna Pillai, another youngster from Dwarkapuri area, said, “My sister and I take care of many dogs in our locality we have adopted about five dogs, all desi breeds,” she said adding that she couldn’t take any more dogs in as she already had five at her home. An NGO with their volunteers had put up about 10 dogs for adoption. They informed visitors about the importance of sterilizing stray dogs in their localities.
 
 
 
 
 The NGO which put up a stall at the dog show claimed they had come up with radium bands for stray animals. “There have been numerous accidents where people die or get injured after their vehicles collide with stray animals on highways and roads. This is very unfortunate. Which is why, we have launched this initiative,” said Nupur Yagnik, a volunteer, adding that they have been getting orders from across the country for the radium bands.
