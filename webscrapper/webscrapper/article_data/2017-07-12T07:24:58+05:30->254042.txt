NEW DELHI: Mistaken for thieves, a 32-year-old man was allegedly   to death and his friend severely thrashed by four others in north Delhi’s Azadpur on Sunday. 

 The one who died has been identified as Deepak. Police said on July 8, the two victims, along with a third friend, were going to an eatery in Azadpur Mandi, where they worked. They were spotted by a woman who, for no valid reason, raised an alarm and called four men who thrashed two of them with rods and stones even as the third one fled. 
 
 In his statement before police, the survivor, Suresh Bohra (23), said that it was around 10pm when three of them had gone to an eatery in Netaji Subhash Place. However, they were asked by the owner to go to another dhaba owned by him in Azadpur Mandi.
 
 “When we were passing by the slums along the railway tracks, a woman came to us and started shouting ‘chor chor’. We tried to convince her that we were not thieves and instead workers at a dhaba but she refused to believe us. As she raised an alarm, four men appeared on the scene,” said Suresh.
 
 Instigated by the woman, they started thrashing the trio with stones and sticks. They kicked and punched the three men without verifying the claim of the woman.
 
 According to Suresh, both he and Deepak sustained serious injuries and were lying beside the tracks. Police later took them to   Ram Hospital. On Sunday, Suresh recorded his statement before the coos. Deepak too was initially discharged but complained of pain and had to be re-admitted to the hospital where he died during treatment.
 
 Parvez Ahmed, DCP (railways), said that a case had been registered and four accused identified. He said that teams were formed to nab the suspects.
