CHENNAI: In a reprieve to  , the   on Wednesday set aside an order of the I-T department declaring him the principal officer of SpiceJet, which made him liable for the TDS defaults by the company. 

  passed the order while allowing a plea moved by Maran challenging the I-T order dated November 3, 2010. Claiming that he was only a non-executive chairman of the company who has no say in the day-to-day affair, Maran said he had not even signed a single document on behalf of SpiceJet filed with the I-T department.
 
 Pointing out that the company had a fulltime managing director to handle the administration, he said, "The managing director himself has written to the department explaining the facts. While so, how can I be declared the principal officer and made liable for the tax dues."
 
 Opposing his contentions, the department said just because the firm had a managing director, it did not mean that the chairman/director did not take part in the management of the company.
 
 Recording the submissions, Justice   said, "Though Maran and his company were holding more than 50% shares, in the absence of any material to establish that he was in charge of the day-to-day affairs, management, and administration of the company, the I-T department should not have named him as the principal officer. The MD also said Maran was only a non-executive director based in Chennai and was not involved with the day-to-day management of the company."
 
 According to the MD, Maran has not visited the company till date as he does not draw any remuneration from the company. He attends board meetings as a non-executive director, for which, he does not get any sitting fees, the judge said.
