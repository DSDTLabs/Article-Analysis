GHAZIABAD: A 45-year-old man was found dead in his heavily damaged car near a forest area in   on Thursday. 

 The victim, identified as Rajkumar Aggarwal (45), was a resident of Nandgram and was driving from Raj Nagar Extension late at night. He used to be a manufacturer of plastic water tanks. Half of his body was found protruding from his Maruti Swift car in an open   located a few feet below the road, where it spun out of control and fell off the road. According to the police, the victim was deprived of any timely medical help as the location was very remote, leading to his death. “His shirt and the car seat were drenched in blood, but we believe that he could have been saved if he had received help on time,” said a police officer from Sihani Gate police station. 
 
 “It is really difficult to assess the real reasons behind the cause of the accident as there are no witnesses,” said Avaneesh Dixit, SHO, Sihani Gate police station. “However, after looking at the condition of the car, we can assume that the car was being driven at a high speed and it would have perpendicularly hit the ground, leading to the visible damage,” he said. “The victim was coming back after meeting his friend and was driving at a very high speed. However, he could not control the vehicle and the car broke through the iron barrier, levitated in air and fell 15-20 feet below the level of the road onto the wasteland. Those who live at a distance from the accident spot said that at 1.30 am they heard a loud collision but because it was pitch dark and the car was off the road, no one could spot the vehicle. In the morning, a man who runs a small shop near the accident spot, saw the car. When he went nearby, he saw the victim’s body half out of the window and informed us.” 
 
 “Aggarwal is survived by his wife and two children. No complaint has been registered by his wife,” the SHO said.
