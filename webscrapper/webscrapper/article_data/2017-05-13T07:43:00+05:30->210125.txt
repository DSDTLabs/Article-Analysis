BATHINDA: The   of   Municipal Council have intensified their efforts to oust the civic body’s chief. They have moved no confidence motion to remove MC president  , who owes allegiance to  

 After Bitta failed to sign the notice issued to him on May 2, the council officials on Thursday late evening pasted it outside his residence, asking him to convene a meeting within two weeks to prove his majority. Rampura council has 21 members out of which 15 have joined hands to oust Bitta from the top post.
 
 This is apparently yet another effort by the Congress to take control of civic bodies in the state after winning the assembly elections. The party has not succeeded in its endeavors so far. 
 
 In the February 2015 elections to Rampura MC, SAD had won majority and Bitta was made the president. Now most of the councillors, even those owing allegiance to SAD, have lent support to the Congress and have asked the party’s Rampura Phool MLA Gurpreet Singh Kangar to elect anyone as president after ousting Bitta, said sources.
 
 Congress MLA Kangar said 15 councillors had issued the notice of no confidence motion against the president. “We are hopeful of unseating Bitta but no pressure has been put on anyone to toe the Congress line,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Rampura Phool MC executive efficer (EO) Maninder Singh Randhawa said, “The no confidence motion notice was sent to the residence of the   Bitta, which was received by his family members. However, he had not signed it. On Thursday evening, the notice was pasted outside his house in which he has been asked to convene meeting in two weeks.”
 
 On the other hand, Bitta said the Congress was using pressure tactics to gain control of the civic administration. “I will soon convene the meeting as per rules,” he said.
