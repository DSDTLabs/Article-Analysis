Chandigarh: Traffic and parking woes have plagued the main   in   since a long time. The lack of adequate number of parking slots for the increasing number of cars is yet another issue, said the parking attendants. 

 The parking, which sprawls before a row of showrooms and shops on its left and the opposite, has been severely affected with the constant pouring in of   including both Light Motor Vehicle (LMV), three-wheelers and two-wheelers as well at almost all parts of the day, in the limited space leaving the visitors and shoppers hassled due to unavailability of any space to exit the parking due to a number of vehicles parked really close to each other. 
 
 The main market in Sector 19 is situated right next to the Palika Bazaar has become a contributing factor to the chaos, due to a stream of haphazardly parked scooters and bikes which often spill towards its left, colliding with the badly parked vehicles in the main parking thus stalling traffic.
 
 The   is insufficient is much smaller than the number of vehicles that get collected here everyday. The traffic swells up to incomparable proportions and blocks the flow of traffic on the road opposite to the market. The people are forced to end up parking their cars on the road sides which becomes highly inconvenient. “There is a traffic jam-type situation almost everyday during the rush hours as well,” said Gulshan, a nearby shopkeeper.
 
 Even though the Chandigarh Traffic Police has been imposing regular challans on the defaulters violating traffic and parking norms in the locality, the situation has hardly changed for the better.
