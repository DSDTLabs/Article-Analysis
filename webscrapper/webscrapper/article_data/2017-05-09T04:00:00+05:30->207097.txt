The total production of rough diamonds in all these mines put together will be around 106.5 million carats, which is an increase of around 13 per cent compared to 94.3 million carats in 2016.
 
 GJEPC regional chairman Dinesh Navadia told TOI, “This year, the industry closed with huge increase in both export and import of diamonds. This shows a positive trend for the overall global diamond industry. India is the biggest manufacturer of diamonds and any increase in the production is a positive sign. The trade is expecting that the prices of rough diamonds will remain under control. We have been advising diamond traders not to stockpile rough diamonds to create artificial demand.”
