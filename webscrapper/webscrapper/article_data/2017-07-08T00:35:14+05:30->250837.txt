Jaipur: With loss-making Kota unit of Instrumentation Ltd now closed, state industries minister Rajpal Singh Shekhawat on Friday said that the Centre should return the 182 acre land that housed the factory and the residential colony and the money given to the company for a revival scheme. In a meeting held on Thursday at the state secretariat, the minister said the state will also collect loans given to the company in a revival scheme. Besides land, the state government had provided about Rs 145 crore to the revival package. Out of which, the CPSE still owes Rs 136.26 crore to the state government.

 The minister said the company owes Rs 136.26 crore without the penalty interest. The Instrumentation Ltd, Kota, was also given 10.59 acre land at Sitapura in Jaipur. The minister said since the company is the owner of 0.59 acre land at Sitapura, the market rate of the land should be given to the state government. tnn
