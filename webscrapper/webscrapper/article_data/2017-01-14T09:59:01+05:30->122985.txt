BARUCH/SURAT:   of RSS, Dattatrey Hosabale has called for major reforms in country’s education system claiming that it is inspired by ‘western culture’. He also said that India’s youth has to play an important role in nation building to free the country from hunger and poverty.

 Speaking at a seminar organised by   on the occasion of 154th birth anniversary of Swami Vivekanand on Thursday, Hosabale said, “Our literature in past 60 years has been mostly inspired by western culture. Hence our minds are colonized and need to be decolonized. We have to come out of the copy-paste culture as we are losing our hard working attitude and academic vigour.” 
 
 “To become a leader at global level, each intelligentsia group and its member should be active and encourage others to join the movement to make India a true leader,” added Hosabale.
 
 He said that India’s acceptability across the globe has increasing and celebration of   across the globe an example of it. 
 
 Replying a question on   said, “Love is natural. Ancient history says that Rukmani was the first to write a love letter to lord Krishna. But love with a malafied intention or with a clear intention to misuse the relationship is not acceptable. Our youth, especially girls, should understand difference between true love and love jihad.” 
 
 Hosable favoured economic reforms. “Positive or negative impact (of economic reforms) will only be over a period of time, but what is important is to take the bold step. It is important to act and wait for its results,” he said at the conclave organised on the same day on “Role of Intelligentsia in current scenario”.
