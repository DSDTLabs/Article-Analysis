HYDERABAD: To extend financial assistance to the poor for their daughters’ marriages , the Telangana government has enhanced the monetary assistance under Kalyana Lakshmi and   schemes to ?1,00,116 from the existing?75,116.

 Chief minister   made an announcement to this effect in the assembly on Monday before leaving for Kolkata.
 
 
 The state government introduced Kalyana Lakshmi and   schemes for parents belonging to SCs and STs and minorities respectively to help them financially during their daughters’ marriages. Later, it was extended to all poor parents irrespective of their caste and religion. Since there were requests that the amount was not sufficient and expenses are on the rise, the CM decided to raise it to ?1 lakh.
 
 “Though the TRS has not made any promise in the election manifesto, while studying the effects of poverty on poor parents, the scheme was introduced to help them financially. It helped girls from below poverty line to get married and the prestige of the Telangana government also increased. Personally, Kalyana Lakshmi is the scheme very close to my heart and I was praised by the people of the state,” the CM said.
