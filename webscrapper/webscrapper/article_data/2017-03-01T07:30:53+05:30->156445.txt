MANGALURU:   on Tuesday said that CM Siddaramaiah has directed the deputy commissioners of all districts to take up a special drive to complete the process seeding Aadhaar numbers with ration cards before June 30. 

 Speaking to reporters, Khader said that the department has been asked to expedite the   process with assistance from revenue department. Karnataka has achieved 90% of the target in Aadhaar seeding process. A mass drive through fair price shops will be carried out across the state to achieve 100% of the goal, he added. 
 
 “Nearly 50 lakh individuals in the state are yet to link their Aadhaar number with their ration cards. We are in the process of identifying them. Fair price shops have the list of ration card members, who have not linked their Aadhaar card number. The department will further scrutinize by deleting the names of members who have shifted permanently from the present address and those who are dead. Considering this, approximately 25 – 30 lakh people may have to link their Aadhaar card number with ration cards in the state,” Khader said. 
 
 The state has saved around 40 lakh metric tonnes of food grains after the process of Aadhaar seeding commenced in the state. 
 
 To a query on his recent statement against those who called hartal in   district opposing Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s visit on February 25, Khader, said that his remarks were against only those who do not have respect towards Indian Constitution. In fact, Khader had compared those who called bandh against Pinarayi Vijayan’s visit to ‘chappals’ at a programme where the Kerala CM was the chief guest. 
 
 “Being a minister I should not have used such words in my speech. However, that was just an emotional outburst against those who do not have respect towards B R Ambedkar and the Constitution,” Khader said.
