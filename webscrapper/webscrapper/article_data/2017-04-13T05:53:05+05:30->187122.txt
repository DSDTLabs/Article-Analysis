LUCKNOW: Chief   Aditya Nath Yogi’s government is reviewing development projects initiated by the previous government and alleging scams and over expenses involved in projects like JPNIC, Gomti Riverfront and Old City beautification and now LDA officials have come under the scanner for exceeding budget in providing facilities at  . 

 Housing minister of state   inspected   on Wednesday and pointed a finger at LDA’s “extravagance” in features like Gondola boats, fountains, light-poles and water-bodies in the park. He said, “Both government and LDA officials are involved in corruption as they have spent Rs 9 lakh on light poles, Rs 16 lakh on boats and over Rs 2.5 crore on fountains. I have asked for original expense copy thrice but LDA has failed to provide it.”
 
 “They are not even embarrassed about cheating public in the name of national flag. LDA has shown expense of Rs 1.39 crore for one flag post which is so unbelievable. They have spent Rs 16 crore on an imported boat made of fibre. Why couldn’t the officials order boats made in India?”
