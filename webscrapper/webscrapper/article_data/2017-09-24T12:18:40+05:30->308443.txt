CHENNAI: Motorists heading towards Nandanam through the arterial   will get a breather, as a portion of the road near DMS will open for traffic after it was cordoned off for metro rail construction for close to five years. Work on the 3.3km underground line from AG-DMS to   is in the final stages. The line is expected to open in the first quarter of 2018. 

 Barricades have been removed and workers are laying a fresh layer of bitumen on a patch of lane leading to Nandanam close to the office of principal accountant general. "The road will open for traffic by next week," an official said.
 
 Opening of the portion of the road will ease traffic flow, as motorists heading from   and   towards DMS through a narrow road will have more space as they head past the AG-DMS entry point. 
 
 Changes had already been made on various parts of Anna Salai, including DMS and Nandanam junction, as the underground work along the route is nearing completion.   workers are giving finishing touches to the entry/exit points of the stations - AG-DMS, Teynampet, Nandanam and Saidapet - that lie along the 3.3km line.
 
  Once the stretch is operational, metro trains will not just connect Anna Salai to the city airport. The arterial road that runs through the heart of gthe metropolis will also be completely restored for traffic. 
 
 The four stations were earlier part of the 7.3km line from May Day Park to Saidapet, which was planned to thrown open by mid-2018. But construction was stalled for more than a year after a contractor abandoned work in May 2015 along the line. It again resumed last year.
