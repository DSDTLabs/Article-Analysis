Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has initiated action against sale of nylon (synthetic) manja in the city. The deadly kite-flying thread has been banned from use by the National Green Tribunal (NGT). However, the officials reportedly did not come across sale of nylon manja.  On Sunday, TOI had reported how despite the green court’s order, nylon manja was easily available in local markets for an extra price. Following this, the civic body swung into action and has started raiding the prominent kite markets. Municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal said that zone-wise action against the sale of nylon or ‘Chinese’ manja started from Monday. NMC officials said that markets coming under Hanuman Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Dhantoli and Dharampeth zones were raided. “Action is being taken under relevant section of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 and directives of state government’s environment department,” they said.  On Tuesday, NMC plans to conduct the raid more aggressively to seize the nylon manja stocks that are mostly kept under wraps by sellers. As reported by TOI earlier, the NGT’s ban has pushed the sale of nylon and synthetic manja underground.  Posing as customers, members of NGO Green Vigil Foundation along with TOI were able to buy nylon manja from some shops in Juni Shukrawari market and Ram Nagar. Pointing out that the manja endangers lives of humans, animals and birds, the anti-Chinese manja activists have demanded stringent action against its sale.
