VADODARA: Forest department has launched a probe after it came to its notice that injured and   birds were “dumped” at the ravines near   on the outskirts of the city on Saturday morning. 

 The birds including around ten pigeons and a kite were seemingly injured due to kite strings during the recent   festivities. 
 
 On Saturday morning, Rajesh   from the Gujarat Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) had informed the forest department about the presence of the injured and dead birds near the newly constructed bridge on Mini river.
 
 Bhavsar said that when he reached the spot, dogs were eating dead birds while there were other birds like a kite and pigeons which had injury marks on their wings. “It seems some organisation would have dumped these birds,” he said, demanding a probe. 
 
 According to forest department officials, prima facie it seems the birds were rescued during the   that was launched by Gujarat government in association with NGOs during Uttarayan festivities to save birds from killer ‘manjha’. 
 
 “While we had sent our team to rescue the birds from the spot, we are probing all possible angles,” said Kartik Maharaja, deputy conservator of forests (DCF) in Vadodara, who did not rule out malafide intentions. 
 
 “It seems that some individuals or organisation would have kept these birds under their private possession without informing the forest department. The circumstances under which the birds were found is extremely suspicious and we are not ruling out any foul play,” he said. 
 
 While the department is probing the possibility of some organisation dumping the birds, it is also probing the possibility of a foul play due to internal rivalry between different NGOs that are working in the city. 
 
 “Our personnel have already started their probe. We will also register statements of persons who contacted GSPCA for a detailed probe,” he said.
