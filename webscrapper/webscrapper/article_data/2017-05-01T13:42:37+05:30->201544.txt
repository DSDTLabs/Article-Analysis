CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh’s state-level helpline for   continues to be unpopular,   in the city have revealed. 

 Moreover, a report of the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution has claimed that Chandigarh did not use the Rs 23 lakh that had been allocated to it in the last fiscal for setting up a state consumer helpline. 
 
 However, in contrast to the report, UT food and supplies inspector   has claimed that the helpline was launched in November 2016. 
 
 According to the document for the 2017-18 fiscal, ‘Demands of grants’, Chandigarh is also among UTs in the country that have not “evenly and properly” implemented the Essential Commodities Act. 
 
 According to the document, “It is obvious from the statement of action taken by the States/UTs under the Act, that the provisions of the Act have not been evenly or properly implemented by the States/UTs. In Chandigarh, during 2016, there were no raids and arrests. But the authorities made three prosecutions and one conviction. The committee, therefore, recommend that the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, be implemented evenly and properly (SIC).” 
 
 Though the UT official said that the helpline had been set up, he admitted that there was a need to promote it and make it popular among consumers. 
 
 “The helpline was well advertised when launched. We can make further efforts to popularize it,” the food and supplies official said. 
 
 Consumers’ Association of Chandigarh organizing secretary   claimed that the number of people reaching the consumer forum were more than the number calls being made to the helpline. “Idly, the consumer forum should be the last resort for any grievance. 
 
 The administration needs to strengthen alternate redressal systems, so that every business has a fear of the law for failing to deliver,” Jhingan said.
