Coimbatore:   from Coimbatore,   and other parts of the country, who had paid lakhs of rupees to the   ( ) to buy dwelling units at   in 2013, are now asked to pay another few lakhs for car parking space. 

 The housing project, already delayed by four years, is expected to be completed this year end. The AWHO has promised the buyers to handover the dwelling units in December. 
 
 TOI visited the project site on Saturday and found it was likely to take another year to complete the project. 
 
 “The AWHO had fixed-rates for small family, modern, deluxe, super deluxe and luxury apartments, and row houses. The prices were fixed anywhere between Rs 19.67 lakh and Rs 46.55 lakh. We had paid 95% of the amount before December 2013 and we were promised the dwelling units by that year end. But so far, they haven’t completed the construction work. It will take at least one more year and the rate has been revised now. We can’t afford the revised amount,” said an ex-service man.
 
 Another retired Major told TOI that he had to sell his house to pay Rs 45 lakh to the AWHO. Since then, he, along with his family, had been staying in in his parents-in-law’s house. He also said the cost of car parking slot has been revised. The revised rate starts from Rs 3.30 lakh to Rs 6 lakh.
 
 AWHO used to construct houses for those fighting and serving in insurgency areas and inhospitable terrain. For the first time, it selected a land at Saravanampatti to construct 400 dwelling units for ex-servicemen and army men who are working in various parts of the state. The construction work was started in 2010. 
 
 When contacted, a senior AWHO officer said they were trying to complete the work in another three months. .
 
 Some buyers have filed a petition before the national consumer dispute redressal commission, which would come up for hearing on October 11. The ex-servicemen also plan to meet the defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman to discuss the issue.
