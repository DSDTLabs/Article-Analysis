MUMBAI: After his  ,   on Tuesday demanded quotas for farmers to tackle the   and halt the sudden spurt in suicides.

 Pawar had recently said in an interview in Pune that reservations should be given to financially backward sections. “Farmers belonging to Schedule Castes, Schedule Tribes will continue to get reservations in accordance with constitutional provisions. But reservations should be extended to those farmers who are socially and economically backward,” Pawar said. Pawar pointed out that his statement in Pune was wrongly interpreted. “Constitutionally guaranteed reservation will not be disturbed. However, it should be granted to socially, educationally and economically backward sections,” Pawar said.
 
 If the Centre and state government amends the reservation policy, then a maximum number of farmers will be benefited, he said. In Maharashtra, more than 82 lakh farmers have less than two hectares of land, and they continue to remain socially, economically and educationally backward.
 
 Pawar came down heavily on the RBI’s policy. “In district central cooperative banks, Rs 112 crore in the demonetised notes are gathering dust, since the RBI has refused to accept them. The banks have been asked to treat it as lost assets. I have told bankers to approach the SC,” Pawar said. He slammed the handling of the loan waiver scheme.
