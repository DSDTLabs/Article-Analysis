Pune: All the data on citizens, who apply under the Right to Services (RTS) Act, will be secure, assured Swadheen Kshatriya, the RTS chief commissioner.

 Giving a presentation on RTS, at an event organised by a citizens’ group called National Society of Clean Cities, Kshatriya said he would raise the issue of “data safety” with the principal secretary of information technology (IT).
 
 “I have taken this up as a priority. MahaOnline is the agency that will be looking into the issues and its technical team will give me all the details,” he said.
 
 When the audience wanted to know the difference between the earlier-introduced Citizen Charter (2005) the RTS Act (2015) and the new government resolution (GR) on zero pendency, Kshatriya said each of the Acts and the GR will be supplementing each other to ensure good governance.
 
 In the six revenue divisions, implementation is being checked thoroughly, the RTS chief commissioner said. While online applications, through the state government’s Aaple Sarkar portal are encouraged, the commissioner said offline applications are also being accepted.
