KOLKATA: Students taking exams at   abandoned their papers and ran out even as teachers frantically made calls to the police on Monday, when two factions of  , which ran the students' union, clashed with each other on the Lake Place Road campus. College general secretary   alleged power minister  's son Sayandeb had been gathering his supporters outside the college gate since morning.

 Around 1.30pm, those youths allegedly barged in and attacked the union room.“They misbehaved with the girl students,“ claimed Rajdeep, adding they had CCTV footages to back the charge. Sayandeb, however, denied any connection. “I never studied at that college. I am a youth leader and was merely near   at that time. I am not interested in college politics. If they can show my link, I will quit politics,“ he said. Alerted, a team from the Tollygunge police station rushed to the college to rein in the warring students. “ A few flower pots were broken and three students received minor injuries,“ said an officer. Lalbazar clarified none of the cops entered the college and legal opinion would be sought on registering an FIR. No arrests were made.
 
 “My son had gone to Lake Road to oversee the construction of a public toilet. He saw trouble brewing at the college gate and some students stopped him and told him about the incident. He neither went there with any purpose nor did he hold any official position. He had no intention to enter the campus. He is being dragged into the controversy by people with vested interests. If he is indeed involved, I will hand him over to the police,“ said Sovandeb.
