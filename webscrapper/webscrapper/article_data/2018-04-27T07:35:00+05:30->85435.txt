Ludhiana: In a shocking incident, a person allegedly killed his uncle after hitting him with an agricultural tool over a monetary dispute at Chowkiman village in Mullanpur Dakha on Thursday. The deceased was identified as Daljeet Singh (50) of Chowkiman village.

 She said that on Thursday, her husband was going to the grain market to sell off his wheat crop when Rajinder stopped him on the way and asked for money. She added that even as her husband told him he would pay the money after selling his produce, Rajinder did not listen, and that led to a heated argument between the two.

In the meantime, the accused ran away from the spot. They added that Daljit was rushed to Civil Hospital, Jagraon, where he died, after which the police was informed about the matter.
