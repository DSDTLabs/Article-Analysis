KOLKATA: Motorists plying on the main arterial road in New Town will have an alternative parallel road in the next two months to bypass the congested stretch in front of  .

 The   (Hidco) is building a 500-metre stretch at Kadampukur area that would help in connecting two existing roads. Once work on the stretch is completed, it will be a 7 km-long road that will move parallel to the main arterial road. 
 
 Presently, there is a broad arterial road starting from the eastern end of the financial hub that was to serve as a parallel traffic route to connect Akankshya More with Tata Medical Centre More. However, there was a litigation over a piece of land at Kadampukur for which a 500 m stretch could not be built. The legal issues have now been resolved.
 
 Once the road opens to traffic, commuting will be much easier for residents of Action III. They wonâ€™t have to travel through the busy Narkelbagan junction. It will also help motorists from places like Ecospace, DLF-2,   and   as well as Amity and   reach the airport.
