GAYA: Glass bottles have been prohibited at the three-day yoga camp of Baba  , which started at Gaya on Saturday morning.

 According to a press release issued by the district public relations department, camp participants are not allowed to carry drinking water in glass bottles. The ban has been imposed for security reasons, officials said.
 
 Those who attended the yoga training on Saturday included Gaya town MLA and state agriculture minister Prem Kumar.
 
 Asked about the participation of Gaya businessmen in the event, former Central Bihar Chamber of Commerce president Anup Kedia said the business body had nothing to do with the event. Chamber members are free to participate in their individual capacity, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, stalls selling Patanjali products have also been put up at Gandhi Maidan, the camp venue.
 
 Beginning the day’s schedule, Baba Ramdev told participants it was the day of ‘natak’ in Karnataka. He was apparently referring to the polling being held in the southern state on Saturday.
 
 Baba Ramdev said yoga had nothing to do with religion. “Like medicine, it heals everybody irrespective of his/her religious belief,” he said.
