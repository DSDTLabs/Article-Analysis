MARGAO: The   ( ) is in a fix over the issue of an overflowing storm water drain located barely a few metres away from the municipality. While the authorities prefer to remain oblivious of the source of the problem, sources pointed out that encroachments by shops on the cement concrete slabs over the ‘nullah’ has prevented any access to the inspection chambers which could facilitate the troubleshooting exercise.

 After the issue came to the fore at a recent meeting of the MMC, Margao MLA Digambar   alongwith the councillors and technical staff of the municipality inspected the storm water drain earlier this week.
 
 The ‘nullah’ was built during the Portuguese regime and the authorities have failed to carry out its regular maintenance. Speaking to mediapersons at the site, Kamat had said he would ask the PWD and MMC engineers to track the source of blockage and clear it.
 
 Sources pointed out that extensions to the facades of several shops have encroached upon the cement concrete slabs placed over the storm water drain. 
 
 These encroachments have also come up over the inspection chambers of the drain, thereby preventing sanitary workers to carry out maintenance or restoration works. 
 
 “The MMC is well aware of the issue, but prefers to feign ignorance. The encroachments by these big shops will have to be removed so as to open the drain to locate where the water has choked,” sources in the know said.
