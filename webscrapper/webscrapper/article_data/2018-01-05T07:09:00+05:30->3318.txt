Mohali: In a goof-up, Punjab local bodies department issued a statement suspending the first mayor of Mohali and later backtracked, saying he has been served a show-cause notice.

 The first press statement stated that mayor Kulwant Singh has been suspended along with two other MC officers for causing loss to the state exchequer. The opening para of the statement read: “The corrupt practices would not be tolerated at any cost and as part of this commitment the Mayor of Municipal Corporation, Mohali, Kulwant Singh has been suspended along with two other officers after taking strong note of the misdemeanours of these people regarding causing loss to the state exchequer (sic).”
 
 However, around two hours later the government issued another press statement, backtracking from the first. The second statement read: “The corrupt practices would not be tolerated at any cost and as part of this commitment the Mayor of Municipal Corporation, Mohali, Kulwant Singh has been given a show-cause notice for his removal from his councillorship and two other officers have been suspended after taking strong note of the misdemeanours of these people regarding causing loss to the state exchequer (sic).”
 
 Local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, while talking to the TOI over phone earlier, had confirmed that the mayor has been suspended. However, he later shifted the blame to the public relations department. “The order passed by me clearly states that a show-cause notice has been issued to Kulwant Singh. I will look into the matter how a wrong statement was issued initially,” he said. He, however, didn’t comment when asked if action would be taken against the staff of the department of public relations.
