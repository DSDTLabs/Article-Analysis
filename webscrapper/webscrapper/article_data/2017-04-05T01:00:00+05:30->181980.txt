Last Friday, seven street play societies were expected to perform at  , the annual street play festival of  . But a day before the event, the college authorities informed the members of Shunya – the   society of Ramjas – that since four plays out of the seven deal with the issue of nationalism, those four teams cannot perform.

  On the day of the festival, as the society members turned up to perform, they were informed that they would not be allowed to because of the 'content' of their play which could lead to a situation of unrest in the campus. This came in the wake of the series of protests that took place in the campus after  , who is facing sedition charges in JNU's February 9 incident, was invited to speak at a seminar in Ramjas College last month. While only three societies performed at Mukhatib, the other four societies used the time which was originally slotted to them to silently protest and not perform anything. The students also put duct tape on their mouth as a symbol of protest.

  Some of the societies which were not allowed to perform managed to talk about their plays, but some staff members closely monitored the event to prevent any unrest. While discussing their plays, most of the students asked, "What will this intrusion lead to?" "Does this mean we cannot even voice our opinion? Or will we too be beaten up if we perform?" While some of the staff members suggested that these questions not be raised either, the team members of the societies which were not allowed to perform told us that incidents like these will not demotivate them, "but if this continues, who will join theatre in the future?"
