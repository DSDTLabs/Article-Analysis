LUCKNOW: By not inviting two stalwarts of the  , former national president   and former state president of the party   at Saturday's national executive meet, party chief   has reiterated that he is no mood for patch up with estranged members of the family and party. 

 It is being said that since Mulayam and Shivpal are both not even members of the national executive, there was no question of their being invited but the counter argument is that they could have been called as special invitees. Mulayam and Shivpal were both in Lucknow and waited for the invitation from party headquarters. 
 
 The senior Yadav brothers toiled throughout their lives to make the party a formidable force in the state and outside in Delhi, yet they were not allowed to attend the executive meet, while likes of Kiranmoy Nanda, Rajendra Chaudhary, Abu Azmi and others who are in the party because of them attended it and deliberated over the party's activities. "It was expected as even the stinging defeat of the party has failed to make present top leaders realise their mistake," lamented an aide of Shivpal Yadav, while those close to Mulayam regretted his getting dumped by his son and leaders of the party he founded. The Yadav family feud that triggered in October 2016 continues and the party and is being felt by the majority within the party and outside as one of the key factors behind the party's humiliating defeat in the elections.
 
 Name plates of Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav had been removed in January soon after the emergency session of the party which had elevated Akhilesh Yadav as the national president and removed Shivpal from his post of state president.
