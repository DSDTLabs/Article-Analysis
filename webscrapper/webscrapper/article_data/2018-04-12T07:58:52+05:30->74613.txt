BAREILLY: Samajwadi   leader   triggered a political row when he said on Wednesday that the BJP government is withdrawing cases of rape, murder, loot, arson and rioting as if there is no requirement of law or court in the country.

 Reacting to the reports that state government has decided to withdraw the rape and attempt to murder case lodged against former junior Union home minister Swami Chinmayanand, Khan said, “Why only Chinmayanand? The government should withdraw rape cases lodged against Asaram and  . People should stop taking cognizance of rape cases.’’ “The BJP government is withdrawing cases of rape, murder, loot, arson and rioting as if there is no requirement of law, court and jails. BJP should take votes of all criminals and give them chance to contest elections. They can open gates of jails. Law is not required when there is no accused. The nation needs to think that country will be run by law or according to wish of political leaders. If fake cases have been lodged against me, the court will acquit me but why is the government withdrawing cases,’’ asked Khan.
