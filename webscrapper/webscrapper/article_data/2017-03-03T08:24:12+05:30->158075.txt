AMRAVATI: Eminent scientist and chairman of Rajiv Gandhi Science and Technology Commission Anil Kakodkar on Thursday made a fervent appeal to science students to use their   for building   of the country so that India can arrest its royalty outgo on imported goods and export its own products to boost its own economy.

 Kakodkar was speaking at the foundation stone laying ceremony of Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Memorial Science and Innovative Activities Centre at Shri Shivaji Science College. Shivaji Education Society president Arun Shelke was in the chair while AS Manekar, director general,  , SM Khened, director, Nehru Science Centre and Arun Sapre, secretary, RGSTC, were the guests of honour.
 
 Kakodkar called upon students to go in for research and use it for developing new technology. “Instead of importing goods from abroad, if we could develop our own technology to produce those goods in our country, we cannot only save the huge royalty outgo on imports but also earn money by exporting our own products,” Kakodkar observed.
 
 “Innovation doesn’t mean mere technology. It is the capacity to extend to people knowledge or a concept in a beneficial way,” he said, adding, “It is the physical form of a scientific concept. We should be a front-runner in the field of science and technology in the world,” Kakodkar said. He called for creating a conducive atmosphere for students in schools and colleges. “There should be right atmosphere for knowledge augmentation of students to facilitate creation of new knowledge which could be converted into technology,” he added.
