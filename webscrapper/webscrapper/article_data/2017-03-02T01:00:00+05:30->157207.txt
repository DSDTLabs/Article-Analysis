For many days, the government and some renowned scientists had spotted a spaceship flying above Varanasi and they had warned people about it landing in the city. Due to some technical glitches, they felt that the vehicle may have landed nearby. They also informed people to immediately bring any suspicious activity to their notice, if they find any.
 Meanwhile, Gaj (Vrinda Dwani) and   (Pratham Shetty), who were on their way back from school, are playing with a ball, which accidentally ends up falling into a pit. They enter the pit to fetch the ball and see a strange kid, who is glittering in a green colour. Gaj and Gillu find him funny, and bring him home. Gillu excitedly tells   (Rajendra Gupta) that he has found Jaadu, who will perform magic for them. Babuji and the entire   family are surprised. They believe that Gaj and Gillu have found the aliens and want to find the spot, from where they got the ‘alien’ kid. When they reach the spot, they are shocked to find the alien kid’s entire family there.
 Rajendra Gupta said, “It will be interesting to watch this track as it reveals something ‘alien’ for the first time in 'Chidiyaghar', which will surprise the audience. Every scene will have mysterious twists.”
