BHOPAL: More than 75,000 domestic consumers in the state capital have not paid outstanding electricity dues amounting to Rs 41 crore.

 Of these, around 9,000 consumers have to pay between Rs 10,000 and Rs 25,000, according to official records of power distribution company and there are nearly 501 consumers, who have outstanding above Rs 1 lakh. 
 
 The   officials keep track of these consumers and initiate drives to ensure recoveries, only those connections are allowed to remain active that at least make part payments. 
 
 Of these 75,000 consumers around 62,000 are those with an outstanding up to Rs 10,000. And 3,000 consumers have outstanding dues above Rs 25,000 and below Rs 50,000. 
 
 “Drives are undertaken on a regular basis against consumers with higher outstanding. Only such connections remain active, which either make payment or at least do part payment. Otherwise, connections are snapped. It is for this reason we regularly keep tabs on data of consumers, who have not made payments,”  , general manager (city circle)   (MKVVCL) told TOI. 
 
 “Majority of consumers with higher outstanding is actually high-end users. We have roughly 9,000 high-end users. And as the upper limit for domestic consumption has been recently increased from 75 KW to 112 KW, there are several consumers whose monthly bills are around Rs 1 lakh, but even these consumers are shown as one with arrears in the system despite the fact that they will pay the bill for continuing the connection within the billing cycle,” Sinha said.
