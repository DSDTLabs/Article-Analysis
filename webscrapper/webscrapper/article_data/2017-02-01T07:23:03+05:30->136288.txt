WASHINGTON: The   on Tuesday began firing dissenters in government and asked career administration officials to quit if they disagreed with the  , amid a widening cleave in US between mostly-coastal liberals and moderates and   constituency of protectionists.

 “These career bureaucrats have a problem with it? They should get with the programme or they can go,“ White Hou se spokesman Sean Spicer said after reports emerged that scores of state department officials backed a dissent cable to register their concern over Trump's refugee ban, saying it “runs counter to American values“ and could be “counter productive“. “If somebody has a problem with (president's) agenda, then that does call into question whether or not they should continue in that post or not,“ Spicer said.
 
 The response came even as Democrat-leaning California began considering a law to make the entire state a sanctuary to protect immigrants from the crackdown, potentially pitting the state against the federal government. The legislation, written by Democrat Kevin de Leon of Los Angeles, will extend the city-specific sanctuary policies that prohibit police from cooperating with immigration authorities to the entire state. There are nearly 200 sanctuary cities that ignore federal law when it comes to prosecuting illegal immigrants, essentially also pitting urban America against the rural counties that backed Trump. 
 
 The cleave is most evident in the West Coast and the East Coast where protests were held in front of the Supreme Court in the capital. President Trump took time to mock it on Twitter between signing more executive orders. “Nancy Pelosi and Fake Tears Chuck Schumer held a rally at the steps of Supreme Court and mic did not work (a mess)-just like Dem party!“ Trump supporters, meanwhile, celebrated the signing.
