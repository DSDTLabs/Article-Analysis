AHMEDABAD: It can just be the vicinity to one of the busiest roads — SG Road — or comparatively higher number of vehicles round the clock, but out of the five top spots for road traffic accidents ( ) identified by analytics of   108 ambulance services, four are located in western city parts.   is the only locality in the east making to the list. 

 In the year 2016, all five areas were located in the west, said EMRI officials. The silver lining is that the overall number of accidents has taken a dip across all segments. The only rise was reported in the RTAs with multiple victims.
 
 According to city traffic police, city roads reported 1,292 cases of accidents in 2017, a drop of about 44% compared to 1,861 cases in 2016. Fatal accidents saw a decrease of 8.77% from 310 to 285. The EMRI data further corroborates that even amid the mayhem and traffic snarls, the reported cases of RTAs has seen a dip in the city.
 
  
 “Most calls for 108 by citizens, ever since its inception a decade ago, are from RTAs. A very high chunk consists of two-wheeler drivers who sustain head and body injuries. With emphasis on initiatives such as wearing helmets, the number might have been affected but a detailed study is required to assess the impact of adherence to traffic rules on the injuries reported in RTAs,” said an EMRI official.
 
 Officials said that areas such as  , Gota and IIM crossroads see high concentration of young riders due to presence of educational institutes and technology-based ventures. 
 
 “Road safety works on the basis of three Es of Education, Engineering and Enforcement. If areas such as Bodakdev and   are consistently on the list of accident-prone zones, a detailed study needs to be devised coupled with analysis of the spots and nature of accidents reported. With better   coverage, we now have a number of recordings of accidents which can be analyzed from road safety perspective,” said a city-based road safety expert.
