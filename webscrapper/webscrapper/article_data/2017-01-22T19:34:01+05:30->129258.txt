NEW DELHI: Junior world champion   (57kg) being upstaged by rookie   was the lone surprise of the day as Haryana and   (SSCB) shared the spoils on the concluding day of the National Youth Boxing Championships here on Sunday.

 Mandeep was stunned by Sakshi 4-1 in the final as she settled for an unexpected silver medal after being unstoppable in the previous rounds.
 
 Haryana, in fact, dominated the women's event with Jyothi (48kg), Ekta (51kg) and   (54kg) also fetching gold medals.
 
 On the other hand, SSCB was the dominant force in the men's event.   (49kg), Ch   (52kg),   (52kg) and Ankit (56kg) all won gold medals for the board.
 
 Etash, who has the experience of competing in the Asian and World Championships, defeated Uttarakhand's Pawan Gurung.
 
 Akash (64kg), however, had to settle for silver after losing to the interestingly named P Brighter Singh of Manipur.
