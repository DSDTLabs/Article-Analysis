The grand convention hall at   hosted PM   and representatives from 56 African nations and experts from across the globe with the plush couches for the dignitaries. The same couches, after the event got over, became the perfect place to take the afternoon siesta for the government officials with the air-conditioning and central location.

 Meeting the old acquaintances
 
 PM Narendra Modi who was leaving the convention hall to meet African dignitaries on Tuesday morning stopped for a while when he spotted  , IIM-A alumnus and founder of G-Auto, in the crowd and called upon him to chat.
 
 Not so smart
 
 The participants at AFDB annual meetings were issued access cards with unique QR codes. The police personnel checked the details of the card and allowed the entry â€” something which the organizers had successfully done at VGGIS 2017. However, this time around, the scanners just refused to work. On Monday and Tuesday, only handful of scanners did its job whereas for others, police had to manually check the credentials.
 
 Language on their minds 
 
 Due to its linguistic diversity, all major functions at AFDB meeting had at least four booths for English, French, Arabic and Portuguese language translators at the venues who immediately translated the speech for the listeners. While events such as VGGIS also had somewhat similar arrangements, the state government officials who were part of the arrangements were amazed at the speed and efficiency of the translators who ensured that the topics are not lost in translation.
