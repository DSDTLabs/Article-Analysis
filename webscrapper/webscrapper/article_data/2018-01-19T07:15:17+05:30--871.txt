BENGALURU: Paintings etched on the walls of the Jain mutt in pilgrim town Shravanabelagola have remained an integral part of its culture, depicting the community's way of life 200 years ago. For the first time, Bengalureans will get to see their reproductions at the Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath from January 23. 

 The artworks, which are reproductions of wall paintings done in Mysuru style about 250 years ago, belong to the   Academy. "Eleven senior artists were commissioned in 1971 to reproduce these paintings. It was a meticulous project that took several months, as the artists sat in front of the actual artwork in the mutt and recreated the magic," said Prof M J  , president, Karnataka Lalithakala Academy.
 
 " The artists - Murugappa Chetti; Y Subramanya Raju; S S Kukke; M E Guru; S Kalappa; S R Swamy; V T Kale;   (cricketer Rahul Dravid's mother); Kalidas Pattar; M S   and M J Kamalakshi - have recreated paintings surrounding the events connected to the 24th Tirthankara," read the academy's special calendar, also brought out to commemorate the   of Lord Bahubali. 
 
 In all, the academy had commissioned 96 paintings in 1971 and 1978, and nearly 90 of these will be displayed at the exhibition, leaving out some repetitions. "Since the academy owns these paintings and citizens haven't really seen them on display, we thought it would be a great opportunity given that Mahamastakabhisheka is round the corner," Kamalakshi said.
