CHENNAI: A day after Tamil Nadu government and rival factions in the AIADMK spent crores of rupees to celebrate former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's  , opposition parties have questioned the propriety in government spending public money to celebrate the birth anniversary of a convict. While Sasikala and two of her relatives were convicted in the disproportionate assets case, Jayalalithaa was abated from the case (just because of her death), though found guilty of the crime. 

 However, AIADMK rebel leader   said the AIADMK cadres and people of Tamil Nadu will see to it that there is no place left without Jayalalithaa's portraits if the opposition makes an attempt to remove her pictures from the government offices and schemes. Panneerselvam said it was unfortunate that Stalin was being vindictive in his criticism against the former CM. 
 
 DMK working president M K Stalin met chief secretary   on Saturday and presented a petition asking her to remove photos of Jayalalithaa from government offices and change the names of government schemes that bear her name. Similar demands were made by the PMK and Congress. Taking a dig at the chief secretary, Stalin said, "The present chief secretary is known for her uprightness and she listened to our complaints and promised to take proper action to prevent use of Jayalalithaa's name in government schemes. But even this upright chief secretary participated in the government function organised to celebrate Jayalalithaa's birth anniversary". 
 
 PMK chief S Ramadoss, in a statement, raised similar demands - to remove pictures of Jayalalithaa and change the names of  . "People in the past have punished those in power for their autocratic behaviour. Unless those in power change their attitude, they will be punished by the people," said Ramadoss.
