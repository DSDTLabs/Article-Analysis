NEW DELHI: Singer   said yesterday his staff were mistreated and called "Indian dogs" by officials in   airport.

 
 
 Sami tweeted yesterday about the episode and tagged the Indian embassy in Kuwait in his tweet.
 
 "We came to your city with love and our Indian brethren embraced us with it. You gave no support. Kuwaiti airport immigration mistreated my staff for no reason and called them 'Indian Dogs'! When you were contacted you did nothing!! How dare d Kuwaitis behave like this with arrogance?!", said Sami in his tweet.
 
  
  
 
 
 External affairs minister   replied soon it appears - as is her wont - asking him to call her, because in a subsequent tweet, Sami thanked her.
 
 "Thank you for your ever so prompt reply. Will call you and give you details. Thank you very much," he tweeted tagging Swaraj.
 
  
  
 
 
 Union minister   also got in touch with Sami about his tweet about the alleged harassment.
 
 "Sorry to learn that @AdnanSamiLive. Our most dynamic EAM @SushmaSwaraj ji has acknowledged your matter. Please speak to her now," tweeted Rijiju to Sami.
 
 The singer was touched.
 
 "Thank you so much for your concern my dear. @SushmaSwaraj is a lady full of heart and she is in touch with me and is looking after our people. I'm so proud that she is our foreign minister and looks after us all over the world," he replied in a tweet to Rijiju.
 
 When someone commented saying Sami got prompt action from Swaraj, he replied on Twitter saying: "That's INDIA 2018 my dear- Don't mess with it. PS: That's also love!"
