AHMEDABAD:   officials are fuming with dull response from   over number of students expected to appear in final   to be held in next couple of months.

 As the final examinations are to begin in March and continue till May, GU asked 152 affiliated colleges to give number of students likely to take appear for the final exam. This was because the university could place an order for printing answer-sheets in time and avoid last minute chaos. To GU’s surprise, only 72 colleges out of 152 affiliated institutes, responded to the query. The remaining 79 colleges failed to respond. The university sent a reminder to remaining colleges, but it did not get any answer, sources said.
 
 Sources also said that this was not the first time that the university authorities are facing this problem. Earlier too, many colleges did not respond to such queries. “In this scenario, the only option available with us to go for printing on basis of number of students appeared in the previous academic year,” a GU official said.
