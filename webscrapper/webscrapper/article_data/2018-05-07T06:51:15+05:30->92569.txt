PANAJI: The Goa mineral ore exporters association (GMOEA), the main trading body of mine owners in the state, said that mining companies are likely to challenge the high court order which set aside the state government’s decision to permit transportation of royalty-paid iron ore after March 15.

 Speaking to TOI, the association’s president,  , said that affected mining companies may have no option but to go to the Supreme Court. Recently, the apex court allowed Vedanta and Fomento to transport iron ore lying at jetties. He said that members of the association are interpreting both the Supreme Court and high court judgments, and don’t want to violate either. 
 
 The state government, too, is assessing the order for necessary administrative and legal action. A senior government officer said that all the points in the order would be examined and necessary action taken. 
 
 A division bench comprising justices N M Jamdar and   on Friday directed the state government to decide within four weeks on the ownership rights as a custodian of the mineral resources. Goa Foundation, in its petition, had claimed that the state government was the owner of the iron ore excavated by companies following the Supreme Court judgment on February 7, 2018.
 
 The court also directed the government to decide on its powers to take possession, sell, and dispose of the ore in question to utilise the proceeds for public purpose.
 
 The Supreme Court had given leaseholders time till March 15 to manage their affairs and continue operations .
