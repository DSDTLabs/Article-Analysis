Chandigarh: Leader of opposition Abhay Singh Chautala raised serious doubts about the procedures followed to bestow the prestigious Bharat Ratna during a special session of the state assembly on Thursday. The matter came up when Congress MLA Geeta Bhukkal condemned ruling BJP party legislators’ snide remarks on the contribution of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to the nation when he was bestowed with the highest civilian award. 

 Chautala pointed out that he is not unaware of the way Bharat Ratna is conferred. Citing examples of former PMs Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, Chautala said both recommended their own names for the highest civilian award while they were sitting Prime Ministers. Nehru was awarded Bharat Ratna in 1955 and Indira Gandhi in 1971.
 
 There was a heated discussion in the assembly when Bhukkal requested education minister Ram Bilas Sharma to rename Gurugram University after BR Ambedkar since the assembly had passed the Gurugram University Bill, 2017. Sharma replied saying that the law university in Rajiv Gandhi Education City in Sonepat has been named after Ambedkar and his party is not in favour of naming institutions after their fathers and forefathers like the Congress. Sharma got support from members of the Treasury Bench who questioned Gandhi’s contributions to the nation that caught the ire of Bhukkal.
 
 Bhukkal also drew the attention of the House towards the financial crisis Panjab University at Chandigarh is facing. She wanted the Haryana government to stem the crisis. 
 
 Congress MLA Jai Tirath Dahiya requested the speaker to find out a way to tackle the harassment MLAs are facing at toll plazas without beacons atop their cars. The speaker assured him that it would come up for discussion soon
