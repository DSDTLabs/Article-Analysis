SURAT: If you are yet to regularize your illegal water connection, you will be asked to cough up four times the fine of water charges ranging from Rs 5,000 up to Rs 80,000, depending upon the size of the connection. 

 City’s ruling   leaders in   (SMC) have turned a red eye against residents using illegal water connections. Also, the BJP leaders have increased the water and drainage connection charges by almost 1,000 per cent in the standing committee meeting held on Wednesday. 
 
 Standing committee chairman   told TOI, “Increase in water and drainage connection charges has been revised after almost two decades. Last time the charges were revised in 1996-97.”
 
 Desai said the city has grown leaps and bounds in the last two decades. After delimitation, the city’s area has increased from 114 square kilometres in 2008-09 to 326 square kilometres having a population of over 56 lakh. 
 
 “From the last many years, the civic body is fighting against illegal water connections in the city. We have given ample time to the residents to come forward and regularize their connections. In a recent   judgment, the illegal connections are to be regularized by March 31, 2018. Thus, we have increased the fine amount for illegal charges from Rs 5,000 up to Rs 80,000 depending on the size of the connection,”   said. tnn
