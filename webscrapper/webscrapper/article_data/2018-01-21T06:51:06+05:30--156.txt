AHMEDABAD: When the body of 19-year-old Sapna   was brought home by her husband, Jaysinh, in a hearse, locals including relatives of the girl confined the husband to the van and women later thrashed him with chappals.

 Local social workers rushed in and rescued him. “We called   police and handed over Jaysinh to them. The relatives suspected that Sapna did not die of illness but was beaten to death by Jaysinh, who is her second husband,” said  , a local social worker.
 
 Sapna’s uncle,  , said Sapna had married   of   about seven months ago.
 
 “Two months into the marriage, Sapna and Nilesh’s younger brother, Jaysinh, fell in love and eloped. They returned later and lived together,” added Rajput.
 
 Rajput said that on Saturday about 3pm, Jaysinh came to their house in Amraiwadi in a private mortuary van (hearse) with Sapna’s body. He said she had died of an illness.
 
 “We soon learned that Jaysinh had beaten Sapna badly two days ago and the scars were visible on her body. Her relatives were enraged and confined Jaysinh to the van and thrashed him,” added a social worker.
 
 Amarsinh Rajput said they suspect Jaysinh had killed Sapna and hence demanded a postmortem. “The postmortem is under way at Civil Hospital. We have lodged a case against Jaysinh with Amraiwadi police,” added Rajput.
