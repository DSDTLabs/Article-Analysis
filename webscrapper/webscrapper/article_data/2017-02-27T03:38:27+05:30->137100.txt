Loved   and  's effortless chemistry in ' '? Well, then ' ' is just the kind of film you've been waiting for. The hit pair of Varun and Alia is back for the next instalment of the 'Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania' franchise. And the trailer, which dropped online sometime ago, packs quite a punch.

 
  
 The 2-minute-57-second-long trailer starts off with a rehashed version of 'Tamma Tamma' from the 1990 film 'Thanedaar' playing in the background as Varun and Alia share glances. While Varun plays a sweet-natured, hopelessly-in-love Badri, Alia acts as the perfect contrast to him ' a feisty, practical and say-it-as-it-is Vaidehi. Be it their fun banter or the romantic scenes, the lead pair serves up a good dose of easy, natural chemistry.
  
 The film seems to have moved from the urban setting of Delhi to the rural hinterlands of North India. With colourful songs, action sequences and generous dollops of emotions - the trailer promises all elements of a masala entertainer.
  
 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania' is directed by   and produced by Dharma Productions. The film will release on March 10, 2017.
