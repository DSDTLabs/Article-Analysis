TIRUVUR: Members of Tamil Nadu   Family Association have expressed grave concern at the conduct of Union minister for water resources   and Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah over the issue of constituting the Cauvery Management Board (CMB). 

 At a meeting held at Mannargudi in   on Tuesday, the members said that ignoring the Supreme Court verdict on the constitution of the board could amount to contempt of court. While the Union minister was non-committal on constituting CMB within the stipulated six weeks, the Karnataka chief minister had rejected the idea outright, they stated.
 
 The members insisted that the CMB should be constituted within six weeks and follow the scheduled release of water. They reiterated their full support to the state government if it proceeded to take any legal action in the event of the SC verdict not being implemented in its full spirit. 
 
 Convener of the Cauvery Family and president of South Asia Consortium for Inter-Disciplinary Water Resources Studies, Hyderabad, Professor  , hinted at what could be the future course of action, legal and otherwise.
 
 It was decided to wait and watch the developments in the next six weeks closely and take up an intensive campaign to educate and spread awareness among farmers in all delta villages with regard to the implications of the SC verdict. It was also decided to emphasise on the need for spreading the news "Save Delta and  " and take it up as a mass movement without attaching any political colours to it.
 
 Secretary of the Cauvery delta farmers' welfare association S Ranganathan headed the meeting.
