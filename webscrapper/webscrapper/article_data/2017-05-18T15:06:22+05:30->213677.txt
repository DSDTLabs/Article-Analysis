KOLKATA: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday directed the state pollution control board to carry out surprise checks on cruise   operating in the   to find out whether they discharge waste in the ecologically fragile zone. The   had taken up the issue of environmental degradation in the Sunderbans suo motu and appointed green activist Subhas Datta as amicus curiae in the matter. 

 One of the issues Datta brought to the court’s notice was the discharge of untreated sewage by large vessels like the luxury MV Paramahamsa that operates out of Kolkata. The pollution board also corroborated the fact but pointed that it was the inland waterways department’s responsibility to deal with this pollution. On March 22, the green bench had rejected the pollution watchdog’s submission and directed it to carry out further inspections. The bench of Justice S P Wangdi and Prof P C Mishra expressed its displeasure on not receiving any report from the board. “The pollution board should carry out checks on waste discharge while the vessels are on the move. Besides that, the level of smoke, light and sound emitted from them should also be tracked to see if they are within the prescribed limits,” Datta said.
 
 The NGT also directed the state government to complete Coastal Regulation Zone mapping of the Sunderbans by July 20, as the Centre has handed over all required data on the mangrove forests. Unless the map is prepared, it would not be possible to demarcate and manage the buffer and core areas of the Sunderbans effectively. The state tourism department has been asked to submit a list of resorts, hotels, lodges and homestays within Buxa Tiger Reserve to ascertain whether these establishments have the requisite forest clearance and consent to operate.
