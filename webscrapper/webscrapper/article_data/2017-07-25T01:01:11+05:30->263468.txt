NAVI MUMBAI: Heavy rainfall in the last six days has spread cheer in the  . 

 Barvi, the biggest of the three dams that supplies water to the city overflowed at 1.30pm on Sunday, while the two other major city dams that supply to NMMC and Cidco areas have sprinted close to the   levels.
 
 While   dam’s stock has swelled to its highest level at 68.6 meter, Morbe   was just three meter short at 85 meter and Hetawane dam level reached 83.65 meter—just 2m short of the overflow level.
 
 Hetawane dam on Bhogeshwari river in Pen, Raigad district, has got the highest rainfall of over 500mm in the last six days while Morbe dam’s catchment area in Karjat has got around 400mm of rainfall and Barvi dam over 300mm.
 
 The total rainfall in all the three catchment areas has been more compared to last year. Even the total July-end rainfall is more than last year’s. Junior engineer of Hetawane dam, Kishore Sheth, said, “With good rainfall this week too, we expect the dam to overflow soon.”
 
 Barvi dam does not release water until the end of monsoon as supply from Ulhas river helps MIDC to pump out treated drinking water to a vast swathe of MMR, comprising several municipal corporations, including the city. 
 
 The dam is the principal supplier to the long TTC industrial belt besides certain pockets of residential areas. While NMMC releases 360 MLD water, Hetawane supplies 150 MLD to Cidco.
