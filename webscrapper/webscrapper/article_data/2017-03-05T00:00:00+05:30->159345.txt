There are many myths that surround women who work out. Forget everything you think you know, and read on to get your   facts straight. 

 
  Thin women don't need to work out
 
  It’s a common misconception that thin women needn’t work out because they don’t need to lose weight. The truth is everyone needs to work out — thin or fat — to get basic strength and flexibility. In fact, weight loss is not ‘the’ goal of working out, fitness is.
 
 
  Stopping training makes me gain weight
 
 Many people stop training but don’t modify their diet to their current calorie needs. When you are training, you tend to eat more as your body demands the nutrition. So, if you cut back on the exercise rethink your diet too.
 
 
    is for women
 
 Not really. Pilates is developed by Joseph Pilates, a man, for everyone. Recently   tried it and called it brutal. On his Instagram video, the star said: “For anyone who’s never tried Pilates – the name sounds cute, but it ain’t cute.” Exercising doesn’t have a gender, it’s a choice.
 
 
 Don't exercise during your periods
 
  Some women benefit from exercising during their monthly cycle – it helps them with cramps and mood swings. Others like to pass it, lying down on their bed. Whatever your menstruation mojo, fitness experts advice you to listen to your body.
