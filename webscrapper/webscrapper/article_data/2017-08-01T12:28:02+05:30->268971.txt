RAMANATHPURAM: Officials from Defence Research and Development Organisation ( ) has issued a ban on taking photographs inside the recently inaugurated Abdul   memorial. The new restriction came in place from Monday morning in the wake of the controversy over placing Bhagavad Gita near the former president's statue. Political leaders issued statements against placing the Bhagavad Gita besides the statue. 

 The restriction is not just for visitors, but also for media personnel. The move has not gone well with the public, however, who were visibly upset after they were denied permission to click pictures and selfies with Kalam's statue.
 
 However, DRDO officials said the restriction has nothing to do with the recent controversy and that the ban was temporary, which may last for only a week.
 
  They said the ban was imposed to control visitors as well as media personnel. "Minor works are still pending and it may take another couple of weeks to complete. The situation was difficult to control, as visitors often do not pay heed to instructions and even enter some of the uncompleted chambers, driven by their eagerness to take photos," an official said.
 
 Another official said that the photographs and other memorabilia kept inside the memorial were very significant and should be protected. But reckless visitors and videographers move closer to them and even caused damage to a photograph. Visitors would be allowed only after railings are installed to keep them away.
 
 Prime minister   unveiled a wooden statue of Kalam playing 'veena' during the memorial's inauguration on Thursday. A controversy erupted soon after, when political leaders questioned the placement of Bhagavad Gita alongside Abdul Kalam's statue. Kalam's grand-nephew on Sunday placed a Bible and a Quran in order to defuse the controversy. However, both the holy books vanished soon.
