PUNE: Soon,   commuters in the city can head out of their homes with lighter wallets as the   has decided to introduce a cashless fare collection system.

 The plan, directed towards digitisation, would be implemented in a phased manner and consists of cards that could be used in many other purchases, officials said. These ‘MI cards’ would help customers also shop, buy railway tickets or pay parking fares. 
 
 “We are focused on strengthening the infrastructure and aim to roll out the cards by April,” joint managing director of  , D P More, said, adding that the project was approved in December.
 
 “The cards can be recharged from time to time. Conductors would have to swipe the cards through the ticketing machines. Though the system is still being finalised, the machines have been fed with the data of different bus routes and fares,” More added.
 
 PMPML chief executive officer   said the first trial would be run on PMPML staff.
 
 “Around 50% of the staff database has been generated. All bus depots, except the one in Swargate, have been provided electronic ticketing machines and internet connectivity. Once the entire database is ready, each employee would get cards with his/her personal details and photograph on it. In the next phase, PMC and   employees would be included in the database,” she said.
 
 Kolhe added that citizens would be able to avail the cards by March-end. “Advertisement campaigns will soon be launched to create awareness,” she added.
 
 Kolhe also said that the transport body was trying to build a secure system so that it could be integrated with other modes of public transport in the future.
