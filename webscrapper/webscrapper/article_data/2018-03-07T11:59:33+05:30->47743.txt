TRICHY: In order to execute efficient water management to overcome shortage, the agriculture department has adopted several water-saving technologies which are all adopted under   ( ) at an outlay of Rs 5.80 crore.

 Officials said that these include construction of farm ponds check dams, percolation ponds, formation and renovation of village ponds, cattle ponds, sunken ponds, construction of recharge shafts, retaining walls, rejuvenation of abandoned wells, clearance of supply channels and constructions of surplus weir at a total outlay of Rs 5.80 crore.
 
 However, water saving technologies have not been added as a component under   because all members of the farmers interest groups are small or marginal who can avail of the facilities and subsidies offered by various schemes operated by the department of agriculture at 100 per cent subsidy.
 
 In collective farming, the farmers are required to get together well before the season and plan collective purchases for all the group members. Value addition could be done by the Farmers Producers Organisation and Farmers Producers Company on a larger scale because they could avail of a loan of Rs 1 crore thereby leading to improved socioeconomic status, the officials said.
 
 MSDA ( ) is implemented targeting only farmers under rain-fed cultivation to prevent surface runoff of rainwater. A sum of Rs 500 per acre is offered as subsidy to farmers adopting summer ploughing in the dryland clusters. 
 
 In areas which have assured water supply, micro irrigation or PMKSY scheme is in operation wherein subsidies are provided for drip and sprinkler irrigation. Water-carrying conveyance pipes are provided under pulses scheme. By using this facility the water available for irrigating one acre can be used for irrigating 5 acres of crop. A sum of Rs 8.5 crore is offered as subsidy for drip, sprinkles and rain gun installation during 2017-18, they said.
