The film   has been so massive that it has left no stone unturned to sweep fans off the floor. Actress   was spellbound just like the others, and she couldn’t resist posting about the same on her social networking page. Even after watching the film for the third time, she looked as amazed as the first watch, and it looked like Amarendra Bahubali’s character was the one, which touched her the most. 

 She posted, “Amarendra Bahubali 🤗 🤗 😍 😍 Bahubali- " Bandhangalil Bahumanam endinu, Sneham Mathi"."Kaalam ella Bheerukalkkum oru avasaram kodukkum...veeran aavaanulla avasaram" 3 pravishyam kandu...kaanumthorum Amarendra Bahubaliyodu aaraadhana koodunnu 🤗 🤗

 “His stunts are not supernatural, but signs of a perfect engineer and a true warrior... ❤ ❤
