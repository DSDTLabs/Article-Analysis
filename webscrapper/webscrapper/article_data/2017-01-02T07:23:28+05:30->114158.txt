BHUBANESWAR: Three new year revellers were killed in an accident near Harishankar, a tourist spot in the   on Sunday afternoon. One of the three died on the spot, while the two others died while being taken to a nearby hospital in Khaprakhol.

 According to police, the accident occurred when the trio were returning from Harishankar. The three were travelling on one motorcycle and had covered 13 kilometres when the motorcycle hit a tree at a sharp curve. "The motorcycle was mangled beyond recognition," said Patnagarh sub-divisional police officer, Seshadeb Bariha. 
 
 The motorcyclists and pillion riders were suspected to have been drunk. "We need to get the postmortem report to be sure whether they were under influence of alcohol. Meanwhile, the deceased's relatives were informed about the tragedy," Bariha added. 
 
 The narrow and serpentine stretch of road has caused many an accident in the area.
 
 Harishankar, at a distance of about 80 kilometres from the Balangir district headquarter town, is a huge draw for tourists from all over the state, especially at this time.
