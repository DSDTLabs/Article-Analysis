CHANDIGARH: Members of Foswac (Federation of Sectors Welfare Associations of Chandigarh) want people to boycott two councillors who supported hike in parking charges. 

 Foswac members slammed both councillors for supporting the hike in parking charges in the house meeting held on Monday.   president   urged residents to socially boycott councillors who supported the companies. These councillors, he said, should not be invited to any public event as chief guests. He declared that Foswac would chalk out a plan to roll back parking fee, saying it is a burden on commuters.
 
 According to Bittu, MP  , mayor Davesh Moudgil and most councillors were against the exorbitant hike but a few councillors supported the move. Association members demanded a CBI probe to ascertain why they did so. 
 
 Foswac will also submit a memorandum to the UT administrator to roll back the   fee. In case of legal complications, the association will avail remedies in court after termination of contract, members said.
 
 Pankaj Gupta, president, residents welfare association of Sector 38 (west) said sector residents were taken aback to know that the area councillor favoured the company rather than residents on the paid parking issue.
