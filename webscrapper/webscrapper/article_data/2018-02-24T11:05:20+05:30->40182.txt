HYDERABAD: With the   on Friday clearing legal hurdles on the mega  , irrigation minister   said the state government will expose the political leaders who have been "trying to stall"   and other irrigation schemes in Telangana. He called the order a "slap on the face of conspirators". 

 The minister was present in the Supreme Court hall in New Delhi when the petition was taken up by a bench comprising Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman and Justice Navin Sinha. An elated Harish Rao apprised chief minister   over phone the decision of the court.
 
 The petitioner, who moved the   on the plea that the tunnel and pump house works of the project were carried out without environment clearance, also questioned the clearances given at a later date.
 
 "We will not spare those who are helping the petitioners to file petitions against Telangana projects. They will be named on the floor of the Assembly during the Budget session in March. People should know who is behind these petitions while the TRS government is trying its best to complete crucial irrigation projects," said Harish Rao.
 
 The minister also pointed out that due to various petitions, the work has been delayed for four months. Without these delays, the first phase works would have been completed by June. "We are now struggling to give first phase result by the end of this year," he said.
 
 The Kaleswaram project is aimed at providing irrigation facility to 18.8 lakh acres in nearly 11 districts by spending over 80,500 crore. The project will also provide water for Mission Bhagiratha and revive irrigation tanks in several districts.
