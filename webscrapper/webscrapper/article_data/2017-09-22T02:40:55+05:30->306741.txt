PATNA: Principals of more than 24 constituent colleges under different universities in the state face “premature” retirement in wake of an order issued by the state education department on Thursday. In a letter addressed to the registrars of all the universities, education department additional secretary Manoj Kumar observed that all those principals who had completed 62 years of age prior to the enactment of the Bihar State Universities Amendment Act, 2017 and the Patna University Amendment Act, 2017, declaring the principals as “teachers” on May 18, 2017, would be deemed to have retired on the date on which they attained the age of 62.   The department observed that since the university amendment acts could not be operative from retrospective effect, the principals who were earlier supposed to be in “non-teaching” cadre would have to retire as per the age of superannuation fixed for non-teaching employees of the universities. The education department has directed the universities to immediately order retirement of all such principals.    The post of principal was declared as “non-teaching” as per the provisions of Bihar State Universities Amendment Act, 2012 and Patna University Amendment Act, 2012. But, later on, when much hue and cry was raised in the academic circles over the age of retirement of principals at 62, the state government introduced new amendment bills declaring them “teachers”. But, this provision came into effect only on May 18, 2017 when the gazette notification to this effect was issued.    University sources said some prominent principals who would retire before attaining the age of 65 (the age of superannuation of teachers) include Rakesh Verma of Patna Law College (under Patna University), Babban Singh of College of Commerce, Arts and Science, Patna, Usha Singh of Sri Arvind Mahila College, Patna, Sushila Das of R P M College, Patna City (under Magadh University), R P C Verma of T N B College, Bhagalpur, Nisha Rai of Marwari College, Bhagalpur, R B Singh of B N College, Bhagalpur (under Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University), Deo Chandra Chaudhary of M L S M College, Darbhanga, Shashi Bhushan Singh of D B College, Jainagar, Jairam Das of U R College, Rosera (L N Mithila University) and S P Singh of R D S College, Muzaffarpur, N N Singh of Rameshwar Singh College, Muzaffarpur and R P Niraj of M J K College, Bettiah (under B R A Bihar University).
