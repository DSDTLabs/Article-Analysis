Vadodara: People alighting at Vadodara railway station will soon get relief from high prices charged by auto-rickshaw drivers at railway station as the railway authorities, along with traffic police have planned to start prepaid auto-rickshaw stand.

 Several meetings have been held between railway authorities, traffic police, RTO officials, railway police and auto drivers’ union to work out the technicalities to implement the concept. 
 
 If all goes well, the authorities are planning to start the prepaid auto-rickshaw booth by May 1 on the Sayajigunj side of the railway station. “There have been several complaints by citizens in the past where auto-rickshaw drivers charge money indiscriminately. Concept of prepaid auto-rickshaw will stop that as passengers will pay the fares in advance,” said assistant commissioner of police (Traffic) S D Rathod. RTO officials have already been informed by traffic police for deciding on the fares.
 
 Rathod added that airports in big cities have a concept of prepaid taxi and auto-rickshaw services. “If the concept becomes successful, we will implement it on the other side of the railway station and also at state transport depot and airport,” he said. “We will be involving all the stakeholders including the auto union, RTO and traffic police. RTO will finalise the fairs location-wise for the prepaid service which will be manned by railway, traffic police and a person from auto union,” said Amit Kumar Singh, divisional railway manager of Vadodara railway division.
 
 The auto drivers’ union too has extended support. “Since both drivers and passengers will benefit from the prepaid service, we will cooperate with the authorities,” said an office bearer of the union.
