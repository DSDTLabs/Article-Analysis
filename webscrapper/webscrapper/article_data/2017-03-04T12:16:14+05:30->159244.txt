BHUBANESWAR: The   (BMC) goes avian friendly. The BMC-run water kiosks that will start functioning from March 25 will provide water to birds too. A separate pot will be kept for the birds.   sources said all the 100 water kiosks to be managed by voluntary organisations and different private associations will provide water to the thirsty birds. The idea was mooted by the voluntary organisations and the BMC agreed to it.

 Considering that around 1.5 lakh birds are seen in the city during summer, the step will provide much relief to the avian species. Birds like bebblers, house sparrows, common crows and pigeons need water during the summer to keep hydrated. "There are other species of birds, which flock to the city from   wildlife sanctuary, on the outskirts of the city, to drink water," said NGO Wild   secretary  .
 
 She said even households should make provision for storing water on the rooftop or at a vantage location so that birds can quench their thirst. "This is for the first time, water for birds has been planned. The kiosks will be opened at selected places such as big markets, public offices, traffic intersections, near hospitals, bus stands, railway stations and Janpath. Water will be stored in clay-made containers so as to keep the water cool," said a spokesperson of the BMC. While water will be served to people by the volunteers of the private organisations, the BMC-owned tankers will supply water to the kiosks. The sanitary inspectors will supervise the kiosks.
