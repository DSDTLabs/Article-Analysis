HYDERABAD: Slamming brakes on the state government's land acquisition work for irrigation projects using a   (GO),   on Thursday restrained the state from purchasing land from farmers under this GO.

 Stressing that the state could not come up with a satisfactory rehabilitation and resettlement package for landless ryots and artisans who stand to lose livelihood on account of such purchase of land by government, the bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice   directed the state not to acquire land using GO123. However, since the  , 2013 provides for adequate safeguards even for the landless and other deprived sections, the state can go ahead and acquire land under this Act after complying with all the rehabilitation and resettlement conditions, the bench said in its interim order after hearing scores of petitions filed by landless people questioning the action of the state and its authorities who were accused of forcibly dispossessing farmers of their land under the guise of a voluntary scheme.
 
 The interim order written by Justice Ramesh Ranganathan noted that the state entering into contracts through GO 123 with willing land owners for purchasing their land for a higher price cannot be allowed to continue because it not only violates the rights of the landless under the new land acquisition Act, but goes against section 23 of the Indian Contracts Act which does not allow such contracts when they adversely affect the lives of others.
 
 Dealing with allegations that even the so-called willingness of the farmers in parting with their land is a result of invisible coercion, the bench, citing various judgements of courts, said the bargaining power of the state and the citizen are unequal. “Equity and good conscience should be at the core of all governmental functions.Every executive action which operates to the prejudice of any person must have the sanction of law. The executive cannot interfere with the rights of any person unless the legality thereof is supportable in any court of law“, the bench said. The bench, however, did not touch the land that was already purchased under the GO 123 for the present and said the validity of such deals would be decided in the final hearing.
