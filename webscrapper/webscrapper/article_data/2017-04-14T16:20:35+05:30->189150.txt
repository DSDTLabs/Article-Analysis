‘Dragon’ stars   and   recently attended the Maharashtrian of the year award ceremony. They chose to have a little fun of their own and played a game where they had to pick actors for various titles from the Indian ministries.

  stars are known to step into the world of politics after they feel that their stint in the film industry is over. So, this was the perfect opportunity for Ranbir and Alia to pick a suitable designation for our stars.
 
 While others didn’t quite have an interesting match, both the actors chose   as the head of Ministry of Women Empowerment.
 
 Kangana Ranaut has always remained strong opinionated when it came to equal distribution of rights and safety for women. If given a choice, even we would have chosen this category for the ‘Queen’ of Bollywood.
 
 Kangana is currently busy with two of her upcoming films, ‘Simran’ and ‘Manikarna-The Queen of Jhansi’. On the other hand, Ranbir and Alia will soon start shooting for Ayan Mukerji’s ‘Dragon’. The movie will supposedly go on floors after Ranbir is done with Rajkumar Hirani’s Sanjay Dutt biopic.
