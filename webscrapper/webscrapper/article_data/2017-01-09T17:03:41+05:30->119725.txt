KOZHIKODE:   continued its tirade against film director and   chairman Kamal with party state general secretary A N Radhakrishnan saying that Kamal should leave the country if he is not interested in living in India.
 
 Speaking at a press conference here on Monday, Radhakrishnan also alleged that Kamal has links with `extremist' organisations like   (SDPI).
  
 "Kamal is a person who have doubts whether one should stand up when the national anthem is being sung. People like Kamal should leave the country if they are not interested in living here," Radhakrishnan said.
  
 Radhakrishnan said that the only eligibility that the Left front government in the state found in Kamal to be appointed as chairman of Chalachitra Academy was that he had termed Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a cannibal.
  
 BJP had staged a protest outside Kamal's house at Kodungallur last month in protest against his response to the controversy over playing of national anthem before the screening of films in cinema halls. Kamal who was the festival director of the recently held International Film Festival of Kerala had criticised the police action of entering the theatres during the festival to nab those who did not stand up when the national anthem was being played.
