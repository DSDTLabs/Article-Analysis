  in Bengaluru on New Year's eve, Union minister   said such incidents should not be seen just through a law and order lens.

 On New Year's eve, many women were allegedly molested by mobs on MG Road and Brigade Road in the heart of Bengaluru. When asked about it, Karnataka home minister   responded by saying "
  ". Police, too, said women are often molested during such celebrations and no case had been registered as no complainants had come forward.
 
  "During days like New Year or Christmas Day, there are women who are harassed or treated badly. We take precautionary measures. But unfortunately, on days like New Year, a large number of youngsters gather on Brigade Road, Commercial Street and MG Road. And youngsters are almost like westerners. They try to copy the west, not only in their mindset but even in their dressing. So some disturbance, some girls are harassed, these kinds of things do happen," Parameshwara told a TV channel yesterday.
 
 
 Even so, he said 1,500 police personnel had been deployed in the area. 
 
 "There are all kinds of people from different states and different cultures. We can't say you have to only behave like this, you have to dress like Kannadigas. Night life is regulated every day but on a day like New Year's or Christmas, definitely it has to have a different approach. Now we will look into this," the state minister said.
