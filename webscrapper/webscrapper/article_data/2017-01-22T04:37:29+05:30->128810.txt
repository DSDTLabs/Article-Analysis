Hospitals and clinics that provide treatment for diabetes, problems of the eye and hair, and infertility, had the maximum number of visitors taking free medical tests and asking tips to maintain a healthy lifestyle.
 
 "I had been wanting to visit a clinic, as I have been having severe hair fall. I saw a hair fall clinic at the expo when I walked into the mall. I was advised to continue taking vitamin D tablets and was also asked to undergo a therapy for hair fall. I also took other basic tests. It was a good experience," said  , a visitor at the expo.
 
 Earlier in the day, actor   inaugurated the two-day expo.
