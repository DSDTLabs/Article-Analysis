BHOPAL: There is a dedicated   and a security guard each for every ISIS or SIMI suspect in  . 

 Last year’s jailbreak, which ended in the killing of eight SIMI undertrials, has forced the administration to take unprecedented measures to avoid a repeat. Every terror suspect is under 24x7 watch even when he is inside barracks, say sources.
 
 The jails department has installed 42 CCTV cameras for 41 such inmates, who have been identified as “dreaded” and kept in the prison’s high security zone. A dedicated team of 50 guards keeps a watch on these men. 
 
 According to jail records, the Bhopal prison has 22 alleged SIMI operatives, three suspects of the ISIS-inspired Indian group accused in the train blast in Shajapur, and 15 accused of running an ISI espionage ring in Madhya Pradesh. Confirming the creation of a high security zone for these 40 undertrials, DG-prisons Sanjay Chaudhary said, “Security has been stepped up in every aspect, be it technical, manpower or in expertise.” 
 
 Explaining the enhanced security measures, Bhopal jail superintendent Dinesh Nargawe said, “We are keeping a watch on inmates of the high security zone using technical as well as specially trained guards. We have constituted a team of 50 personnel for this. At any point of time, there are at least 14-15 personnel keeping an eye on the 40 inmates. Their duties are rotated every eight hours. There are CCTV cameras even inside the barracks and their movement is monitored round the clock.” 
 
 This is part of the revamp of jail security that was prompted by an audit after the October 2016 jailbreak. Officials say there is more to come in terms of surveillance, electronic and otherwise, which will be replicated in prisons across the state.
