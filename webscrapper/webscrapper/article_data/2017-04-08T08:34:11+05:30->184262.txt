NEW DELHI: “Your film would have run if your hero had not slept through the night. If your hero slept, why are you blaming me... why are you making me a villain?” highways minister   said on Friday, taking a swipe at Congress’s Goa in-charge (Digvijaya Singh) for the party’s failure to form government in the state after the assembly elections.

 His remarks came in Lok Sabha in response to   member K C Venugopal’s allegation of BJP’s “anti-democratic” role in Goa. Venugopal, who otherwise praised   for doing a very good job as highways minister, raised the Goa issue during a discussion on the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill, 2016.
 
 “He (Gadkari) took a villain’s role in Goa for his party,” Venugopal said referring to the minister’s role in installing a BJP government in the state despite the party winning only 13 seats in the 40-member assembly.
 
 Gadkari’s response was directed at   who was the Congress’s Goa in-charge.
