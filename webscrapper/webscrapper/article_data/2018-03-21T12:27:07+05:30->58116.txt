PATNA: A group of youths carrying a JD (U) flag allegedly thrashed constable Mila Devi while she was on duty at the police checkpost near   in the city on Tuesday.

 The constable received several blows on her face and head. The checkpost was also vandalised by the attackers. An FIR was later lodged by the constable in the   police station against unknown people.
