NEW DELHI:  's BJP chief minister   said today his administration respects the   ( ) order lifting four states' ban on   and will provide security at movie halls screening the film.

 
 This, on a day his party colleagues in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan moved the SC to modify its ban order.
 
  "We will give security to cinema halls that show movie Padmaavat. We respect the SC order," said Khattar.
 
 "If someone decides not to screen the film it will be good, but if someone screens the film, they will be provided security. It is our duty to comply with Supreme Court's order," he added.
 
 When the SC last week lifted a ban on the controversial film by the BJP-ruled Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, it said that its state administrations' job to provide security and ensure law and order, even as the sanctity and inviolability of the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression is a constitutionally guaranteed right.
 
 Earlier today, the States of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan moved the SC seeking it modify its earlier order lifting the ban on the screening of 'Padmaavat' again citing law and order issues. They said that that because maintaining law and order is their constitutional duty, prohibiting the screening of a film to prevent untoward incidents is also part of that same duty.
 
 Several fringe groups oppose 'Padmaavat' alleging it distorts history or shows the Rajput community in bad light. Despite the censor board clearing the film's release, the BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh banned its screening.
