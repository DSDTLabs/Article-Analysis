BENGALURU: The Times SPARK campaign has aroused a sense of inquisitiveness among students and largely got them interested in reading the newspaper, say principals of   who participated in the programme.

 “Children have got interested in a range of topics and they read the paper regularly. While most of them started reading because they wanted to compete in the test, for a few it has become a habit,” says  , viceprincipal at Amara Jyothi Public School.
 
 With the test done, the number of children reading the paper keenly may have gone down, but a lot of them admit that reading has helped them hone their language and writing skills. Many have realized that reading benefits them more than watching TV, she points out. The programme was a good initiative as it got students involved in a lot of current issues, she adds.
 
 T N Chandra, principal of St Mary’s Public School, says the campaign helped generate interest in reading. “Students responded well to the campaign and now I find they’ve got interested in reading, not just the newspaper but other things too. They are inquisitive and eager to learn about current issues.”
 
 Students from various schools in the city have been attempting the mock tests, and will compete in the final test scheduled on January 7. The highest number of student registrations in the city were by students from Seshadripuram High School, Mitralaya Girls High School, BGS National Public School, Alamen High School and  , among others.
 
 Sinchana N V, a class X student of VVS SPHS, Bengaluru, who is scheduled to take thetest on January 7, says the campaign has widened the range of articles she has started reading after the programme started. “I used to read the newspaper earlier too. But after the campaign started, I began reading about a wider range of topics. I used to read the Times of India online and now I’ve convinced my parents to start subscribing to TOI at home,” she adds.
