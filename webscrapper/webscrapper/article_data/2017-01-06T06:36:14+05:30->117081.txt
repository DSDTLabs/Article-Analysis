LUCKNOW: Poor public response to urban development ministry’s Swachhata App and   on sanitation service is likely to hit city’s   Survey ranking. 

 Out of 306 downloads, 75 users have registered complaint on the app, of which only 30 cases could be resolved, while others are either rejected or still pending. Also, only seven complainants gave their feedback—four showed extreme dissatisfaction, while one expressed satisfaction and two remained ‘neutral’.
 
 Last year too, Lucknow ranked 28th because of adverse feedback. This year, the   with an easy public redressal and feedback mechanism had come as a hope for  , the agency responsible for sanitation. Citizen feedback carries 600 marks, of which 100 have been earmarked for the Swacchhata App. 
 
 The agency was aiming at 24,000 downloads but with inadequate publicity and lack of awareness, only 306 individuals had downloaded it till the last date, January 3. In terms of number of downloads, Lucknow was at 121st position among 500 cities of the country competing for ranking under Swachh Bharat Mission 2017. Within UP, despite being state capital, Lucknow ranked fifth with Varanasi, Aligarh, Saharanpur and Ghaziabad taking the lead.
 
 Officials are now banking on other parameters such as door-to-door garbage collection and solid waste treatment plant to improve scores. A team of urban development ministry is on three-day visit to Lucknow to survey. LMC officials would be making the presentation before the team on Friday. 
 
 When asked about poor score, LMC environment engineer Pankaj Bhusan said, “Other cities used hoardings, banners and word of mouth publicity to draw attention of people towards the significance of using this app. But we could not do so given the short notice. But we are confident to score on other parameters of SBM 2017.”
