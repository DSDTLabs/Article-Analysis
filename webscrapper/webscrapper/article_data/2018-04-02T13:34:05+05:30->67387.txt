 The show closed with showstopper actress  , who turned up the heat, looking absolutely ravishing in her floral, summery gown. Talking about her collection, Aakriti said, “This season, our inspiration is from the beautiful clematis blooms. We have driven inspiration from its shades and it being in full bloom. So, we have incorporated the same with flowers. I think 2018 is all about being brave, forward-thinking and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone and Ultra Violet reflects and supports this zeitgeist perfectly.”
