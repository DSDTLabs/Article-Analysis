MUMBAI:   chief   on Tuesday challenged the   to hold elections through ballot papers to clear doubts over the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs). As votes for the Karnataka elections were counted and the BJP seemed set to emerge the single largest party, MNS chief   agreed with Uddhav. "This is a victory for the Electronic Voting Machine," he tweeted. 

 
 Uddhav pointed out that the BJP was losing bypolls but winning assembly elections. "If you (BJP) trust yourself, hold elections through ballot papers once," Uddhav said, reacting to the election results. Congratulating the BJP for its success in Karnataka polls, the Sena leader hoped that the people of that state would now witness 'acchhe din'.
 
 Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said the Karnataka election results had set the course for a "bigger victory" for the BJP and the NDA in the 2019 general elections. "The wave of hope created by PM   has now been transformed into a wave of faith and the people have expressed it through their mandate."
