NEW DELHI: A bunch of friends would call up random people for fun. But when they saw that some men were interested in a woman in their group, they thought of making some money out of it. Soon, they formed a gang and started  . 

 Police got wind of it when a man informed them about a group of five that had got introduced to him through a random phone call. He said he started talking to the woman frequently. 
 
 Two weeks later, they met at a bus stand in Nangloi. Two days after that, she invited him over to her house. 
 
 The man said the woman refused to meet him anywhere else. At this, he refused to meet her and asked her never to contact him again. 
 
 A day later, when he was going for work, four people accosted him. He was abducted in a car and taken to a secluded spot where he was thrashed and stripped naked. He was then filmed in the nude. The crooks then threatened to release the clip on social media if he didn’t pay them Rs 23 lakh. 
 
 The man expressed helplessness and said he couldn’t pay such a hefty sum. At this, he was given five days time to pay Rs 5 lakh. The crooks then decamped with his valuables and Rs 85,000. 
 
 The man went to the police, who laid a trap and arrested all three, including the woman. The men were identified as Sandeep Dalal and Adarsh Kumar. 
 
 A gold ring belonging to the complainant was recovered from the woman. Two others are on the run. 
 
 The trio told the police during interrogation that they were involved in several extortion cases with similar modus operandi. Police said most cases went unreported as the victims feared for their honour.
