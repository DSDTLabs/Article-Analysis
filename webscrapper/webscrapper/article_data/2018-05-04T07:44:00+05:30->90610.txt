Ludhiana: Four-and-a-half years after the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered removal of   falling within five metres of scheduled roads (state highways), the building branch of the Ludhiana municipal corporation has failed to do so.

 Since the HC orders in 2013, officials have removed only 32 such structures while more than 1,700 encroachments are still in existence.
 
 City-based RTI activist Rohit Sabharwal has now lodged a complaint with the principal secretary, director and MC commissioner over this issue.
 
 In a reply to the RTI query, the building branch officials had admitted the fact that they could remove only 32 structures and 1,732 structures are yet to be removed.
 
 In the orders passed by Punjab and Haryana high court in CWP number 4559 of 2007 dated July 9, 2013, it was clearly mentioned that, “As far as the area falling in the municipal limits is concerned, the states are directed to issue directions to the municipal councils to take action as per law.”
 
 As per PUDA Act, any kind of commercial and residential accommodation (after 1995) should be constructed at distance of five metres from the main roads and if construction has been done, then these should be dismantled. The officials had conducted demolition drives in 2013 as well after putting red marks on the structures, but they stopped removal of encroachments soon.
 
 Sabharwal said the civic officials are least bothered to fulfill directions of high court. He has requested the senior officials to make the officials act against 1,732 structures.
 
 Assistant town planner (headquarters) S S Bindra said he has already issued the directions to the officials concerned to act against encroachers and follow the directions of HC.
