PANAJI:  , the oldest in Asia offering higher education in the stream, is planning to expand the intake of its research centre. The college is in the process of recognising four more research guides, after which they will be able to double the intake of its PhD students. Goa being home to many pharmaceutical units, there is a local employment market for researchers in the line.
 
  Until 2013, pharmacy graduates had to travel outside the state to pursue a doctorate. In 2014, the research centre at Goa College of Pharmacy was established, starting with an intake of three students. The research hub has grown quickly due to demand for PhDs in pharmacy in the local job market. Currently, 10 students are pursuing research at the Goa College of Pharmacy.
  
  Presently, the college has four recognised guides—one each in the four streams of quality assurance, pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmacognosy and pharmacology, offering doctorates.
  
  “With the current number of guides, we can offer seats for doctorate research to a maximum of 12 students in the general category. If we get another three to four guides, we will be able to take a maximum of 24 students,” college principal   said.
  
  Goa College of Pharmacy offers a four-year degree after Class XII and a two-year diploma after 10+2. There are 60 seats on offer at the graduate level and an equal number for the diploma course. The institute also offers MPharm programme.
  
  The college is equipped with around 17 laboratories to fuel research activity. The research activity allows students to explore a specialised area of their choice, which enhances their value in the job market.
  
  Though Goa also has another pharmacy college at  , the state-run Goa College of Pharmacy remains the most popular one.
