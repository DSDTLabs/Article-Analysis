JODHPUR: Suspended IAS officer   was sent to judicial custody on Tuesday after her police remand was completed. Though, some officers from RAS and RMS services have remained prisoners in this jail in matters related to corruption but Meena will be the first IAS officer, who has been sent to   under judicial custody.

 DIG (ACB) Ajaypal Lamba said that during six days of interrogation, she provided many facts supporting the case against her. “Though, largely she remained non-cooperative in the interrogation but whatever she said was adequate to support our case against her,” Lamba said. He said that on the basis of her interrogation, the then deputy commissioner (Food and Supplies)  , was also interrogated for two days.
 
 “But no incriminating evidence has surfaced against him,” said Lamba adding that he would be interrogated further in relation to this case. He, however, admitted to having received demand of additional 35,000 quintals of wheat from Jodhpur. The ACB has arrested three persons including Meena in this case and the fourth accused, an LDC of the department   has been absconding.
 
 Except Meena, two other persons arrested by the ACB in this case, are a contractor Suresh Upadhyay and owner of a flour mill  , who allegedly had connived with Meena in siphoning off 35,000 quintals of wheat worth Rs 8 crores.
 
 On the other hand, the ACB has registered a case against her husband Pawan Mittal for disproportionate assets. He was earlier about to surrender with Meena on last Wednesday but he did not. The ACB has been building pressure on him also to surrender.
