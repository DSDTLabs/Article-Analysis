NAGPUR: New district collector Ashwin   has said that   would be his top priority. He listed his other focus areas during a press conference held on Wednesday

 Before the conference, the collector felicitated environmentalist Surbhi Jaiswal for being conferred Earth Day Network Rising Star award. She is the second person from India to bag the prestigious award.
 
 “There are about 17-18 villages that are doing excellent work in the field of water conservation. We will provide all possible help to them. The area irrigated by Totladoh dam is facing a mini crisis as inflow in the dam has reduced due to construction of Charai dam in Madhya Pradesh. Water conservation works will have to be undertaken on a big scale in this area,” Mudgal said.
 
 Replying to a query on Jalyukt Shivar, he said there was no shortage of funds. “Around 330 works are going on in 2,220 villages of the district. We needed Rs 95 crore for the project in the district and by March end we had received Rs 85 crore. However, it is a fact that work order of 410 tasks have not been issued. But we are confident of completing them by June end,” said Mudgal.
 
 The collector said he would create awareness about crop rotation among farmers. “We will also take steps to curb the menace of bollworm in the district,” he said. The collector said he would ensure that infrastructure projects in the district, especially those being executed by MahaMetro and National Highways Authority of India, got land as fast as possible.
