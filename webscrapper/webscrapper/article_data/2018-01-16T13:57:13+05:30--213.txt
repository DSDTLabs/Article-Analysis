BHUBANESWAR:   S C Jamir on Monday advised universities and colleges to scale down political activity on campuses. Speaking at a conference of vice-chancellors here, Jamir, who by virtue of his position is also the chancellor of universities, asked the ruling   to take the lead in curbing campus activism. 

 "Political intrusion in educational institutes disturbs the academic atmosphere and dilutes the quality of education. The ruling party should take the initiative and involve other parties in ensuring peace and stability on campuses," the governor said.
 
 The chancellor called for more focus on quality, research and excellence to meet global academic standards. "Vice-chancellors should visit affiliated colleges and take steps to improve them. Each should be made a centre of excellence.   should be given equal importance. All universities should come up with a sporting complex on their premises," he said. 
 
 Jamir also urged universities to adhere to the optimal faculty-student ratio.
