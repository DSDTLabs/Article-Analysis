As the Kannada-Telugu bilingual Rogue, produced by Tanvi Films, hits theaters today, it’s a moment of reckoning not only for director Puri Jagannadh, but also the actors he is introducing to audiences. The big-ticket launch pad for producer CR Manohar’s nephew  ,   also brings actresses   and   to Sandalwood, as well as new villain Anoop Singh Thakur. Ishan, who is looking at being simultaneously launched in two industries, tells us what makes the film a must watch. “Rogue is a complete entertainer with all the elements of a commercial flick. At its core it is a love story, but there is ample drama, comedy and action as well,” says the debutant actor. The biggest draw, he adds, is that it is a   film, which has audiences intrigued about what’s on the platter this time around. And if the trailer is any indication, there is a treat in store for movie buffs, what with the production house leaving no stone unturned to ensure that Ishan’s debut is a heady mix of glitz, glamour and high-octane action. “The story has a feel-good factor, which will stay with audiences much after they’ve left movie halls,” says Ishan, adding that the visuals and the songs by Sunil Kashyap are also major USPs.
