GHAZIABAD: Councillors of opposition parties struck work on Tuesday and sat on protest inside the office of   (GMC), demanding release of funds for undertaking civic works in their respective wards. No funds have been released for undertaking civic works in municipal wards after the urban local body elections took place last year.

 The protest was later called off after municipal commissioner assured that demands pertaining to funds will be taken up in a board meeting that is scheduled to take place on March 15.
 
 In the 100-member municipal corporation, there are 43 councillors who do not belong to ruling BJP. On February 27, these councillors said that corporation officials were meting out preferential treatment to BJP councillors for works to be undertaken in wards. However, GMC has denied this charge.
 
 “Though we called off our strike now, we’ll be back on March 16 if the board of the corporation does not release our funds. Over last three months, not a single civic work has been undertaken in wards belonging to   councillors due to lack of funds. The mayor had announced to release a sum of Rs 50 lakh for each ward, but it was a political gimmick,”   councillor,   told TOI.
 
 “A meeting of 12-member executive committee of councillors will be held on March 7 where issues pertaining to works in municipal wards will be sorted out,” said municipal commissioner, Chandra Prakash Singh.
