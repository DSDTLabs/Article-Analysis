KOCHI: The   (DMRC) principal adviser E   inspected   on Wednesday morning as part of the plan to clean and revitalize the water body. 

 "The desilting process began a week ago and currently they have reached the area near St Teresa's college hostel. Now, the water flows in the eastern direction. We are trying to deviate the flow of water towards the backwaters in the west. For this, we will have to remove some obstacles, including trees, on the banks of the canal," said Kochi corporation works standing committee chairperson P M Harris.
 
 Throwing garbage, including plastic, into the canal restrict the flow of water. 
 
 "Sreedharan guided us with his technical knowledge, and he visited the sites and gave opinion on the progress of the work," added Harris.
 
 The local body will initiate steps to remove unauthorized shops and other structures on the banks of the canal. 
 
 During heavy rains, water enters many of the shops and outlets.
