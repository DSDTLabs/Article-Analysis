 WFI's response came after Sushil responded to the federation's show-cause notice, denying his involvement in the scuffle which saw some alleged Sushil supporters thrashing Rana's elder brother Naveen following the high-tension bout between Sushil and Rana in the 74kg category. Sushil beat Rana 7-3 in the semifinal and then Jitender Kumar 4-3 in the final to qualify for the CWG.
 
 
 Rana had recently filed a written complaint with the WFI, alleging that it was Sushil who instigated his supporters and threatened to harm him and his brother for daring to take the mat against the celebrated Olympian from Baprola village in Delhi's Najafgarh. Earlier, Rana had lodged a police complaint against Sushil and his 'supporters' for their involvement in the fracas.
 
 Sushil, in his single page reply to the WFI which has been accessed by the TOI, has said that he would never do anything "intentionally or unintentionally" to bring the sport of wrestling into disrepute. 
 
 "Wrestling is my life and I am always committed to the sport of wrestling. I had no intention to demean wrestling or any of the wrestler and I will never ever do it. I myself didn’t want to disrupt the discipline of the federation and I’ll always follow it in the future. I want to assure that neither I nor any of my supporters were involved in this whole incident. I condemn the entire episode," Sushil wrote in his defence.
 
 Instead, Sushil expressed his "shock and surprise" over the allegations levelled against him by Rana. "When I had won the trial, I had no other bout to fight and I left the wrestling hall straightaway to meet the waiting media outside.
