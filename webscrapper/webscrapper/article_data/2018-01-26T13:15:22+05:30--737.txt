BAREILLY: In a bid to improve income of the poultry industry, scientists at the   (CARI) have developed a DNA-based technology for determining sex of zero-day chicks (soon as they hatch from eggs). An important part of the   is separation of one-day old chicks - to breed quality male birds for the production of meat broilers and female birds for eggs. This technique is especially helpful for farmers rearing diversified poultry species.
 
  Unlike chicken, the sex of domestic birds cannot be known for several weeks after they are born.   chicks are identified in 16 weeks, guineafowl in 12 weeks, ducks in eight to 10 weeks and quails in four weeks. “If the chicks are segregated soon after their birth, it will reduce expenses of farmers and enhance their income. A farmer has to spend Rs 3-4 per day to feed a single turkey bird. Similarly, the feeding cost per day per bird is Rs 1 to 2 for guineafowl and ducks, while it is Rs 0.50 to 1 for quails. The farmers have to also incur expenses on vaccination, medical, feed and other management costs before their sex is determined,” said  , principal scientist, CARI.
  
  Under the new technology, 100 microliter of blood sample is taken from a baby bird to determine its sex. “Any farmer or entrepreneur can purchase the equipment. It will cost around Rs 1.50 lakh. CARI will also provide free training to teach farmers about the technology,” added Kumar.
  
  CARI scientists are also planning to start a mobile van equipped with the technology and visit farms across the district to conduct tests. “We will charge a nominal price of Rs 10 per sample which is less than the current input cost of rearing both male and female species for weeks,” said Kumar.
