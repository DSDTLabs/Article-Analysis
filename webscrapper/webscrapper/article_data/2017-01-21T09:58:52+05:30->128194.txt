Skeletons, eggs and nests of dinosaurs were discovered at Raholi in Gujarat and   in Madhya Pradesh, he said. “Fishs, frogs, turtles, crocodiles, birds and mammals survived because of their omnivorous habits,” he said. 

 Dinosaurs disappeared from earth approximately 65 million years ago. Talking about the reasons behind the extinction of dinosaurs, Mugal said, “Many scientists have suggested different theories to explain why dinosaurs disappeared. Some theories say a shower comets hit the earth, others point to the Chicxulub crater while some blame it on the volcanic eruptions in Deccan Traps. But one thing is sure; all these reasons caused massive climate change which led to the extinction of dinosaurs.”
 
 “Our world is also suffering from rapid climate change and it is the biggest concern for the human race. So, as the inhabitants of earth, we all should strive to conserve our environment,” said Mugal.
