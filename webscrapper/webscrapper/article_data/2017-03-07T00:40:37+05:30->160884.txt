MUMBAI: Patients suffering from   tuberculosis may soon get access to Delamanid, one of the two new drugs to get approval for   treatment after over 40 years. 

 The   was added to the shrinking kitty of choices to treat multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR) soon after bedaquiline.
 
 The head of   (ICMR) Dr Soumya Swaminathan said that the manufacturer of the drug has submitted an application with the DCGI. “The drug is yet to be registered  . We will probably adopt the same pathway as we did for bedaquiline, which is conditional approval. It will only be allowed in programmes and may not get marketing authorization,” she said. Delamanid, known for its novel mechanism of tackling the bacteria, has shown good results in treating MDR and XDR TB.
 
 Meanwhile, the results of the first National Drug Resistance survey is expected to be made public ahead of the World TB Day on March 24. The study has looked into the resistance patters of 13 TB drugs.
