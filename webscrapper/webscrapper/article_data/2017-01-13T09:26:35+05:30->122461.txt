KOLHAPUR: The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation’s (MSRTC) next digital motive is putting   which ply on the  , to automatically deduct the toll charge.

 The e-tag will help deduct the toll charge from the account of the corporation, which plies buses on the interstate routes.
 
 Currently, there is only a smart card system for every bus to pay tolls, which has to be recharged every month.
 
 Divisional controller of MSRTC Kolhapur division, Navneet Bhanap said, “We have received a circular about installing e-tags. The e-tags will be installed in the front of the buses on the national highway routes. The buses on the state highway routes have not been included in it yet. The e-tags will be scanned at the toll points and the amount will be deducted from the account of the corporation. The bank for transactions has been selected. Currently, the Kolhapur division pays Rs 58 lakh as toll.”
 
 Bus depot officials have welcomed the digital move. Abhay Kadam, the stand in charge of Central Bus Stand (CBS) said, “My depot pays around Rs 5 lakh as toll every month at the four tolls between Pune and Kolhapur. We need to recharge the smart card every month, which is time consuming. Once the e-tags are put, it will reduce the time and there will be no need to recharge the amount every month. It will save money and the risk of handling cash.”
