Madurai: The streets in Gomathipuram Tendral Nagar have become unfit for motor vehicles as the roads here have not been repaired for years. Gomathipuram Tendral Nagar, under zone 2 in ward 30, has six main streets, 60 cross streets with 1,500 houses and 5,000 residents Among the damaged roads, the Paver block 6th main road connecting the ring road has been damaged for the last several months. Other inner roads like Kurinchi 1st street , Sevvanthi street, and Talai street also require immediate attention. “Travelling on a bike on the roads is risky. The wheels of my car often get punctured due to potholes on the road. Residents have been filling debris in the potholes for last two years. We need an immediate solution before the rainy season,” said R Sandhya, a resident of Kurinchi 1st street. “Most of the paver block roads in our area have been damaged due to the implementation of the underground drainage project works. Our area was linked with Madurai corporation in 2012. From that year onwards we have been having a tough time to get civic issues resolved. A lot of petitions have been submitted through our welfare association in the last two years,” said S G Ramanathan, secretary of Tendral Nagar Residents Association.
