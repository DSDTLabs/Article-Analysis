NAGPUR: More than 200 volunteers of   (VRAS) staged a protest against the monetary policies of the central and state governments at   on Friday. The protesters claimed that the new rules introduced by various banks had badly affected the common man.

 Speaking to TOI, Waman Chatap, chief of VRAS, said, “After demonetisation, the government had announced that no charge would be levied on ATM transactions. The situation has now changed and banks have imposed restrictions on free ATM transactions. To add to the woes, there are number of instances where ATMs regularly go dry and people have to move from one place to another to withdraw their hard-earned money.” 
 
 The central government’s move to demonetise notes of Rs1,000 and Rs500 last year to curb black money was just a gimmick to cover up its failures on various fronts, Chatap claimed.
 
 Shrinivas Khandewale, core committee member, said, “The government was going soft on big industrialists when it came to recovery of loans. However, loans of thousands of distressed farmers are not waived off. The policymakers in Delhi should work for the poor and desist from protecting the interests of the rich.” 
 
 Nanda Parate, a lawyer, said the middle class was feeling cheated as the banks have started charging heavily on ATM transactions despite the fact that they had responded positively to the government’s appeal to go cashless. 
 
 Ram Nevle, member of VRAS, criticized the state government for going back on the promise of creating a separate state of Vidarbha. A team of VRAS will meet RBI governor and discuss the new banking norms.
