HYDERABAD: A five-year-old boy was thrown into the   on Saturday. Fortunately, the boy, identified as Dhanush, was rescued by onlookers and the Lake Police. 

 "Dhanush was brought to the naala by someone he identified as his uncle. He supposedly threw him into the water and left," Ramgopalpet inspector P   said.
 
 Later in the day, police established the identity of the boy and found that he is a resident of Jagathgirigutta. Police also found out that the boy's parents -- Mahesh and Subadhra -- had lodged a missing complaint at the   station. 
 
 Mahesh and his brother had a spat over some business issues. "So, in a bid to take revenge, he tried to kill the boy by throwing him in the Hussainsagar naala," the inspector added. After the incident, the young boy was too shaken to tell police anything about himself. "Even to simple questions, he cried," he said. In the evening, the boy was sent to a local hospital for check-up and after that he managed to tell police the names of his parents. 
 
 The Lake Police summoned his parents to hand over the child.
