MARGAO: Chairperson of South Goa Planning and Development Authority ( ) Renuka D’Silva on Wednesday said that the land use map of   was done as per provisions of law and that the Outline Development Plan (ODP) will evolve in a transparent manner. 

 Addressing reporters in the presence of SGPDA member secretary K Ashok Kumar and vice-chairperson of   (MMC) Tito Cardozo, D’Silva said that the SGPDA “wouldn’t mind extending time” for receiving feedback from the public over the land use map.
 
 “The land use plan is a visual survey that maps out every existing structure in the city, while the ODP shows proposed zones,” said D’Silva. “Therefore, the land use maps may have a few flaws and thus the public needs to point those out to us. The public needs to be alert and participate in the planning process. We believe in planned development. All necessary steps will be taken to hear public suggestions. The land use map has been prepared with much effort and as per the provisions of the law. Let’s go by the spirit of the law.” 
 
 She justified the SGPDA’s move to outsource the preparation of the land use map, stating that the government was not well-equipped with the apparatus and the technology (drone technology was employed in making the land use map) for conducting the visual survey,” D’Silva said.
