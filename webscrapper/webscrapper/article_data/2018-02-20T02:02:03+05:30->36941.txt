MUMBAI:   will take out a   at CSMT on Tuesday to protest against the railway ministry's decision to set up a rail museum at the heritage building. 

 The ministry has decided to set up the museum on the ground and first floors of the Unesco-designated world heritage site building. 
 
 CRMS general secretary   said, "There is no need to set up a museum by vacating the premises. It is an expensive idea, crores will be spent in not only setting up the museum but also to build another structure, where new office space will be created to house staff."
