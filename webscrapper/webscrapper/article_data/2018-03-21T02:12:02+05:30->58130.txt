Kolkata: The Kolkata police STF, which had shared vital inputs with its Mahara-shtra anti-terror squad counterparts hoping to bust a Bangladeshi terror netwo-rk, have finally found it efforts bearing fruit.  Three suspected members of the banned Ansarullah Bangla Team — an al-Qaida front banned in Bangladesh — were arrested from Wanowrie and Akurdi in Pune. “The case is with NIA. But the probe that we carried out after arresting five top ABT operatives a few months ago established that a few Bangladeshis were arranging acc-ommodation for ABT operatives,” said an official.
