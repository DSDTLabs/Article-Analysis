AAPsaid that the EC is issuing political statement on the issue of EVM tampering instead of taking due action. AAP said “EC has completely failed in its duty to protect the EVMs...and therefore failed in fulfilling its constitutional obligation of conducting free and fair elections.” 

 AAP said that the incident shook the faith of millions of voters in the entire process of election using EVMs. 
 
 Meanwhile, the EC will replace over nine lakh EVMs with advanced M3 machines before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the government has informed Parliament. These machines will become inoperable the moment someone attempts to tamper with them. The new EVMs are likely to be introduced by the end of 2018.
