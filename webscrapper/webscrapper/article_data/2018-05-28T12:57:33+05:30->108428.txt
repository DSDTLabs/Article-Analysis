I can also take to the streets,” screams an elderly woman. Shaking with fury,   says: “One year has passed. What has happened to my  ? Have they been punished? Should I take law in my hands?”

 Her only son,   alias Babloo, was the heir of this pucca six-room house and 5-bigha farmland. He had married in 2016 and the family had everything to look forward to. Until a police bullet killed him during the farmer agitation in Pipliamandi on June 6 last year. His wife, Anita, a Class X pass, was given a compensatory job at the   collectorate and lives in a rented accommodation near her office. Durga Bai is left all alone.
 
 She does not have any grievance against Anita. “She is young and recovering from her loss. If she wishes to remarry, who am I to stop her?” she says. Asked about the Rs 1 crore that the government gave as compensation, she says: “What shall I do with money? It’s Anita’s right, anyway. The only truth is, my son is gone,” she sobs, sifting through photographs of Babloo’s marriage. “If a policeman had been killed, would they have waited a year to catch the culprit?”
 
 “I want the culprits hanged to death. Nothing short of it will do. That’s all I think, all day,” she fumes. “My life has no meaning left. I hope to see my son’s killers punished before I die.”
 
 Balaram Patidar, Babloo’s uncle, said. “Villagers call Babloo a martyr and have installed a statue at the main village square. When will we get justice?”
