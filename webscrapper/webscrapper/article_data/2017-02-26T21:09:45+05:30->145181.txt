Whether she's wearing skin baring attire or engulfed in a poufy pink gown,   always makes headlines for her Grammys red carpet looks.
 
 At the 59th Annual  , the superstar proved that point yet again when she stepped out in a custom   Priv' ensemble. The bralette top which showed off her chest tattoo was embroidered in sparkling tangerine orange crystals and the midriff tattoo grabbed eyeballs instantly. She paired the stunning piece with a voluminous deep black silk ruffled skirt. She added to the look a wide-array of jewels, including a jaw-dropping diamond cuff on her wrist.
  
  
 And no Rihanna red carpet moment is complete without a head-turning hairstyle. For this year's awards night the singer opted for long auburn-hued locks with soft waves. She kept the look minimalistic with smouldering eyes and nude lips. 
  sure knows to turn heads with her bizarre yet striking killer looks!
