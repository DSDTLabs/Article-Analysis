ROHTAK: The family members of ex-serviceman Ram Kishan Grewal of Bamla village in Bhiwani district are hopeful of receiving the Rs 1 crore compensation promised by   in Delhi by the month end, despite lieutenant governor Anil Baijal not approving it.

 Grewal, who was at the ex-servicemen’s   for implementation of one rank one pension (OROP), had committed suicide on November 1, 2016. After high political drama in the national capital and at the veteran’s native village Bamla, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced Rs 1 crore compensation to his family and termed him a “martyr”. Even   vice-president Rahul Gandhi had attended the funeral of Grewal at Bamla.
 
 Grewal’s son Jaswant Singh, who had remained sarpanch of Bamla, said, “We are a little worried with Delhi LG Baijal’s decision not to approve the compensation file sent by the AAP government. CM Kejriwal has assured that he would not back out at any cost.”
 
 Jaswant said they had approached Kejriwal again after Baijal’s disapproval of the file and were assured to “get our due possibly within this month”.
 
 The family members claimed that Union minister Ram Dass Athawale, who had announced a government job to one of them in the past, had promised to deliver on his commitment shortly.
 
 AAP Haryana convener Naveen Jaihind said the Delhi government was committed to fulfill the announcement to give Rs 1 crore compensation. “The compensation would be handed out to the family as soon as the Delhi high court allows it,” he said.
