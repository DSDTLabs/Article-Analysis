PATNA: All emergency paediatric cases at the   (PMCH) will now be handled by the emergency surgery department.

 The PMCH on Thursday issued a directive to the effect, a copy of which was also sent to the state health department. The letter says the head of paediatric department has also been directed to ensure that infants requiring ICU or paediatric care after a surgery be taken care of by the paediatric department.
 
 The PMCH move follows reports of PMCH referring an infant suffering from perforated anus to the   (IGIMS) due to non-availability of a paediatric surgeon at the PMCH at that time.
 
 The infant’s kin alleged they were made to run from one end of the PMCH to another for three hours before being advised to go to the IGIMS. 
 
 According to sources, several posts in the department are vacant, including those an associate professor, two assistant professors and a resident doctor. 
 
 PMCH principal Dr Vijay Kumar Gupta said process for appointment of doctors in the paediatric surgery department was underway.
 
 Dr Gupta also said things would immensely improve once the PMCH’s redevelopment plan was executed. According to the plan, the number of beds in PMCH has to be increased from 1,700 to 5,000. The first phase of the redevelopment plan is scheduled to be completed by 2021.
