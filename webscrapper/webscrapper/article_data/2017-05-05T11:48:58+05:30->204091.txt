PANAJI: In a bid to improve Goa’s ranking on the ease of doing business scale, the   (CII) has offered to run Ease of Doing Business (EODB) clinics across the state, in collaboration with the government. It has also proposed to help diversification into the food processing and defence manufacturing sectors.

 “Goa is a small state, so I see no reason why a rank should slip. There are certain changes that need to be made. The intention is to work with the government on each and every parameter to try and improve rankings this year,” chairman of CII, Western Region, Ninad Karpe, said.
 
 Representatives of the group called on chief minister   and discussed how CII could help Goa find new avenues for employment generation. “Goa has to find new avenues. Food processing could be one of these, with particular focus on spices and agri parks. Agriculture mapping should be done to identify what is grown in Goa and what is required. Goa needs to de-risk itself from tourism and mining,” deputy chairman of CII Western Region, Piruz Khambatta, said.
 
 CII is also keen on assisting MSMEs to prepare for the Goods and   (GST) regime. “We will try and engage with the state department of commercial tax. With GST, our aim is to spread as much knowledge as we can, particularly to MSMEs, to make them aware of how to comply with various laws in terms of process changes,” Karpe said.
 
 With regard to defence and aerospace, CII has already held meetings to see how business-to-business linkages can be set up among MSMEs, large defence companies and public sector undertakings. “We have to try and provide an opportunity to MSMEs in Goa to become suppliers and providers to this new sector. They can even become partners in this industry,” Karpe said.
