BAREILLY: The state government has chalked out a three-phase plan for all municipal bodies to make   districts encroachment free by March.
 
  According to   officials, the three-phase plan includes eviction process, seizing of belongings and spot fines, and allotment of mobile shops to local vendors.
  
    mayor   told TOI, “In the first phase, we will launch a massive eviction drive to remove encroachments from footpaths, roads and other public places. In the second phase, we will launch a drive to check reoccupation of the evacuated place by encroachers. Defaulters’ belongings will be seized, and they will be subjected to on the spot fine ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh. The process of allotment of compact portable shops to local vendors will be taken up in the final phase.”
  
  BMC officials said encroachments by roadside vendors, hawkers and eateries were a major hindrance in the development of the city and also cause traffic snarls.
  
  Municipal commissioner   said, “Although we carry out regular drives against encroachers, this will be carried on a large scale. Those who reoccupy the evicted spaces will be imposed hefty fines on the spot and their belongings will also be seized. Moreover, we have designed special compact shops that will be allotted to local vendors on a monthly rental. The shops will give an organised look to the city markets and will also ease traffic congestions.”
  
  TOI had earlier reported that the government would soon be providing special task force (STF) to all municipal bodies to remove encroachments and take prompt actions against encroachers.
