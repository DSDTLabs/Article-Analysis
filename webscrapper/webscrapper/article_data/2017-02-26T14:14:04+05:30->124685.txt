Vikram is a man on a mission in director Gautham Menon's 'Dhruva Natchathiram'. The teaser of the movie which dropped online recently might just be Tamil cinema's answer to Hollywood's Bourne series. 
 
Longer than most teaser trailers, this 2-minute 38-second clip follows the story of John played by Vikram, an undercover agent based in New York. He and his team are involved in a secret operation that is headed by a man named Mr K. John and his team spring into action when the bad guys catch hold of Mr K, leaving them in the dark. Overall, the teaser manages to impress with its Hollywood-style treatment along with catchy and bold dialogues. 
 
‘Dhruva Natchathiram’ also stars Anu Emmanuel as the female lead with music from Harris Jayaraj.
