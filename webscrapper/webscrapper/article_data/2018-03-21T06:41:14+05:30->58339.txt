NEW DELHI: A significant highlight of foreign minister Sushma Swaraj’s statement in   on Tuesday was the manner in which she attacked Harjit Masih, the man who was among the 40 kidnapped by Islamic State in June 2014 but who managed to escape. She rejected Masih’s claim as a “cock and bull story”.

 In fact, the foreign minister has never given any credence to Masih’s account of the killings. Hours after the disclosure by Indian authorities in June 2014 that the workers had been kidnapped by IS, a Bangladeshi worker who, too, had just fled Iraq said Masih had told him that all the Indians in the group had been shot dead. Masih was in the custody of Indian authorities for a while after his return to India.
 
 However, after his release, he told the media in   that all members of the group had been killed and that he alone managed to escape.   though accused Masih of concocting this story and said India had information from the owner of the firm with which the construction workers were employed that Masih had managed to flee from Mosul by claiming to be a Muslim.
 
 Apart from the Indians, a group of Bangladeshi workers, too, was in the custody of IS jihadists. According to the owner, the IS asked the caterer who provided the workers food to drive the Bangladeshis (apparently because they were Muslims) to Erbil. According to Swaraj, Masih called up the caterer and told him that his name was Ali and that as a Bangladeshi he, too, had to be freed.
 
 “He concocted the story that he and the other Indians were taken to a jungle and shot,’’ Swaraj said.
 
 Swaraj had said in her statement in Parliament last year, too, that Masih’s story was full of contradictions.
