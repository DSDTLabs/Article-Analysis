BATHINDA: A newlywed man was allegedly assaulted by a group of youths after he objected to their "shouting and creating disturbance" during Holi celebrations in Jaitu town of Faridkot district on Friday. The man sustained grievous head injuries and succumbed to them a few hours later. 

 Police have registered a case of murder against four residents of the town and six others, who are yet to be identified. The victim, identified as  , 22, was a taxi driver and got married just five months ago. 
 
 In his complaint to police, the victim's brother Bittu said Rakesh had objected to around 12 motorcycle-borne youths shouting and creating ruckus at Peerkhana Basti at Jaitu while playing Holi. He said Rakesh asked the youths, who were allegedly inebriated, not to make a noise near his home.
 
 The boys left the spot, but returned after some time carrying blunt weapons and attacked Rakesh with a baseball bat and an iron rod. Rakesh's family took him to Jaito civil hospital and from there to   in Faridkot, where he succumbed to his injuries. 
 
 "Rakesh passed away in the hospital. We want strict action against the guilty and will not cremate the body till arrests are made in the case," said Bittu, who is also a taxi driver. 
 
 Faridkot senior superintendent of police (SSP)   said four of the accused had been identified as Radhe, Naval Kishor, Ashwani Kumar and Sahil. 
 
 "We are trying to track down the accused," he said. Angry over police not making any arrests in the case, residents held a potest on   road on Saturday.
