GURUGRAM:   levels did not dip on Wednesday, despite overnight rains in parts of the city and Delhi. Officials of the Met department said skies will remain partially cloudy on Thursday, with temperatures coming down to 30-32°C, as winds from northern states would mellow the rising   trend for the next 24 hours.

 Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RWFC) officials, however, told TOI that there would be a sharp rise in mercury next week, with temperatures rising to as high as 36°C.
 
 Parts of Delhi,   and the NCR received moderate   on Tuesday night. In the evening, Gurgaon witnessed fierce thunderstorms and lightning.
 
 While light showers were reported in Gurugram as early as 7pm, residents said a longer spell of rain took place around midnight.
 
 RWFC said there would probably be more rainfall on Thursday. “The current rainfall activity is due to the active western disturbance underway. There might be further spells of light rains in Gurugram and parts of NCR, although it would not be felt significantly in Delhi. Thunderstorms are also likely on Thursday,” an RWFC official said.
 
 Officials also said mercury would come down to 30°C on Thursday, as the advent of north-westerly winds would bring down the rising heat levels. But temperatures will rise sharply after the spell ends, they said. “It will show a rising trend now. Next week will be hotter. We’re expecting mercury to hit 36°C soon,” an official said.
 
 On Wednesday, the maximum temperature recorded was 32°C while minimum temperature settled at 21°C.
