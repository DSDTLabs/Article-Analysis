PANAJI:   (CCP) on Friday wrote to the chief electoral officer seeking permission to hold its ordinary general body meeting, which the civic body has currently kept on hold, until they receive approval from the election commission. But, the commissioner and   do not appear to be on the same page about the matter, as both have written separate letters with subtle indication that they don’t agree with each other’s views.

 CCP planned to hold its ordinary council meeting on February 21, but the proposal was shot down by CCP commissioner Dipak Dessai, who stated that due to the code of conduct still prevalent in the state, no meeting could be held.
 
 Dessai had clearly stated his views in writing on February 14, when he said, “it’s not proper to have a corporation meeting till the code of conduct is lifted”. Mayor Surendra Furtado, however, went ahead and finalized the meeting, and this may have widened the rift between the commissioner and the mayor, CCP officials said.
 
 Furtado argues that since no policy decision is being taken, the corporation can go ahead with the council meeting since the polling process was completed on February 4. Both Furtado and Dessai have now written to the chief electoral officer conveying their stand on the issue and seeking explicit approval from the election commission’s office to hold the meeting.
 
 “It may be proposed to the chief electoral officer to convey the corporation meeting before March 10,” Dessai has said in a note to the director of municipal administration.
