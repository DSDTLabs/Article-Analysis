BENGALURU: Retired Chief Justice   has called upon the central government to enact the anti-sports fraud bill to take on the growing number of cheats in the fraternity.

 "The (Prevention of) Sporting Fraud Bill was given to the then government in the aftermath of the 2013 IPL spot-fixing case. Thereafter it has remained with the government. If it gets enacted, at least some part of it (the frauds) will become criminal.
 
 "Otherwise, today you have to go through section 420 which may or may not be applicable and it is debatable. We studied provisions of 22 countries relating to sporting fraud before shaping the Bill. I hope at some stage the Parliament thinks it fit to pass it. I hope it will happen," said   who was at the symposium conducted by The Sports Law and Policy Centre and Go   here on Saturday.
 
 Justice Mudgal, who was recently made the chairman of   review and governance committees, said the   reforms could be made applicable to other sports federations too. "The Lodha Committee reforms are laid down in a judgment of the Supreme Court which is the law of the country. The general principles contained there will apply to all across the board. It is only a matter of implementation. The principles laid down are generic in nature and can be applied."
 
 On activists and the public not being able to post   queries online, Mudgal felt it would help in reducing expenses. "I agree (that it is a tedious process) to file an RTI and get a reply. I think it can (making it online) be put in the rules. It doesn't even have to go to the parliament. Public movement on this front would help."
 
 Mudgal also continued his pitch for legalizing betting. "It is a little incongruous that you have betting on the skill of a horse and jockey but can't bet on the skill of a batsman or bowler," he said.
