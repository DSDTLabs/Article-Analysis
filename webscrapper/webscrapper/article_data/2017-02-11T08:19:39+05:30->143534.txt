JAIPUR: Reacting to ex-Pakistan captain and match-fixing whistleblower  's comments that cricket as a whole remains far from clean and his country should not be singled out, some former colleagues said Latif could have refrained from making such comments.

 They were very much aware that the country had been deeply embedded in match-fixing because of bookmakers' involvement who have been making huge profits routinely from international matches across the globe.
 
 Pakistan has been badly hit by match-fixing scandals with former leg-spinner   the latest to face a life-ban over a spot-fixing case during a 2009 county match between Essex and Durham.
 
 Three other top players -  ,   and   - are also serving bans in a spot-fixing case that surfaced on team's tour of England in 2010.
 
 In 2000, Pakistan banned former captain Salim Malik and paceman Ata-ur Rehman after a two-year long judicial inquiry conducted by Lahore high court judge Malik Mohammad Qayyum.
 
 Latif, however, accused the England and   ( ) of making Kaneria a scapegoat.
 
 "Right from the onset the ECB did not have a strong case against Kaneria," he claimed.
 
 Now, what would be the reaction of Latif, when the Pakistan Cricket Board provisionally suspended Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif under its Anti-Corruption Code and the pair were sent back from the Pakistan Super League. 
 According to information from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Sharjeel and Latif have been suspended and the rigorous and wide-ranging investigation by the   supported by the   will continue as part of collective efforts to protect the integrity of the sport.
 
 Does Latif have the courage to stand up and challenge the decision of PCB or claim that it's a simple ploy to tarnish their image?
