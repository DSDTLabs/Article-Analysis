HYDERABAD: In what is expected to bring about the next major revolution in brain tumour surgeries, the city-based  , on Wednesday, unveiled the country’s first tesla 3   (iMRI), which has been installed at its   branch.

 The Rs 23-crore worth MRI machine, which allows doctors to conduct real time mapping of the brain during a surgery, is expected to cut out a neuro-surgeon’s dependence on experience for precision, said experts.
 
  
 “It usually takes 1,000-2,000 surgeries for a neurosurgeon to achieve a high-level of clarity and accuracy in excision of tumours. This latest technology (which provides highest precision image) can lend the same level of accuracy to surgeons who are new,” explained Dr Anandh Balasubramaniam, senior neurosurgeon at the hospital adding that often surgeons are faced with a tough choice between the cost of safety and precision. “Surgeons tend to leave behind a part of the tumour to ensure safety and this is where technology can step in,” he added.
 
 While iMRI is the most advanced technology available for brain surgeries, prior to this, microscopes in neurosurgery and neuro-navigation made it safe to perform delicate surgeries. “However, watching under a microscope, surgeons could only visualise a part of the brain. To plan and reach deep structures was difficult and filled with risks. To have some form of intra-operative imaging can guide surgeons better and make the surgery safe and effective,” Dr Anandh said.
 
 Also, the fact that in many cases complete excision of the tumour is not possible, despite best efforts, makes the technology important. “As the iMRI is done during surgery, it can confirm, in real time, if the surgery went as planned. In case any residue is found, the patient is subjected to further surgery before completion,” added Dr G S Rao, managing director, Yashoda Hospitals.
