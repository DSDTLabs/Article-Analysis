KOCHI: Eminent Malayalam writers who recently visited the   called the art fest an avenue for expressing   and a platform for collaboration of ideas.

 Paul Zacharia,  , and Indu Menon were amongst the noted authors who visited Biennale over the past few days.
 
 "I see Biennale as a new progressive movement that allows artists from around the globe to express their fresh ideas and artistic concepts. It is similar to the time when the Malayali attained a new literary perception while reading literary classics by Tolstoy, Victor Hugo that were translated to Malayalam. The Biennale does something similar by bringing international artists to the context of Kerala and thus updating us about the emerging trends in world art," Zacharia said.
 
 Writer   she found the Biennale as a space for freedom of expression.
 
 "The Biennale has enabled art to stage a powerful comeback by giving complete freedom to artists to work beyond any external pressure," said Menon.
 Poet K Satchidanandan who visited Biennale earlier in January had stated that Biennale helps to promote alternate thought processes and perceptions.
 "Biennale has facilitated a platform for artists to recreate lost worlds through images, worlds lost due to conflicts and wars, thus warning the present about what has happened in past and what should not be repeated in the future," said Satchidanandan.
