NEW DELHI:   and a   (PAC) member   has sought to move a   against committee chairman and senior Congress leader K V Thomas, alleging that the latter used the panel to   of the PM by claiming to summon him.

 During a press conference in Kochi, Thomas had said the PAC, which is examining the NDA government’s decision to demonetise high-value currency notes, had the power to call even the PM on the issue. The Congress leader had reiterated his remark even as the PAC, in a statement on January 13, clarified that the PM would not be called. The PAC had summoned RBI governor Urjit Patel and sought the details. 
 
 “It was blatant politicisation of the working of the Public Accounts Committee, purely to gain despicable media attention and serve his (Thomas’s) ulterior motive, thereby, lowering the dignity and ethics of the committee,” Dubey said in the letter written to Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Tuesday. He urged the Speaker to refer the letter to the committee of privileges for examination so that he could raise the question under Rule 223 of Lok Sabha in the upcoming budget session from January 31. 
 
 Dubey alleged that Thomas became restive and was searching for options to politicise the demonetisation move soon after Modi announced it on November 8. “Although demonetisation was aimed at eliminating black money, destroying fake currency and narco-terrorism, Thomas started using the platform to meet his political objectives of lowering the dignity of the PM,” he said. 
 
 Nishikant Dubey said K V Thomas used PAC to ‘lower the dignity’ of the PM by claiming to summon him.
