NAGPUR:   don Arun   again moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court seeking furlough. Earlier, on October 17, he was granted parole by the court for attending to his ailing wife, who underwent surgery in Mumbai.

 A division bench on Tuesday, issued notices to the DIG (Prisons) and Central Jail superintendent in Nagpur, asking them to file a reply within two weeks.
 
 According to his counsel Mir Nagman Ali, Gawli moved an application for furlough, which is of 28 days, to DIG (Prisons), but it was rejected. Subsequently, he approached the judiciary.
 
 The gangster-turned-politician was convicted for the murder of Shiv Sena MLA Kamalakar Jamsandekar on August 3, 2012 along with 11 others and was awarded rigorous life imprisonment. The gangster was brought to Nagpur Central Jail in March last year, after being awarded lifer along with 11 others.
 
 Last year, Gawli was out on parole for 15 days to attend his son’s wedding, which was extended by a month to attend to his ailing mother. He again applied for a month’s parole in July, citing wife’s illness. 
 
 However, his application was rejected by the divisional commissioner who, while relying on the advice of Mumbai police, said that the gangster’s return might cause law and order problems in Mumbai.
