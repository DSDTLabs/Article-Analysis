Just days before an action sequence for   was to be shot, director   had a reason to worry —  , who plays a   in the film, had hurt his wrist. The professional senior actor didn’t want to interrupt the schedule, so, action choreographer   Mor made some alterations, as a result of which, the sequence turned out to be better than what was originally planned. 
Recalling the incident, Janardhan says, “There is a brief action sequence in the film, in which Avinash sir is seen thrashing two accused. But three days before the shoot, he injured his wrist and suffered a hairline fracture. Since everything was set and we had to shoot the fight sequence, Vikram altered the sequences so that Avinash sir doesn’t strain his injured hand; he did the entire sequence with only one hand. I was skeptical if the scene would turn out the way we had planned, but to my surprise, the very drawback worked in the favour of Avinash sir's character. He plays a corrupt cop in the film, but no matter how morally wrong he is, the entire aura of his power never comes down. And in the entire action sequence, the slow-mo and his effortless beating contributed to a more subtle, but stylish extension of his character.”
