NEW DELHI: In the last four days, US President   has put his money where his mouth is, which why he sent many Americans into a tizzy late last night when he threatened to "send in the feds" to Chicago if it doesn't solve its crime problem. 

 
  
  
 
 Trump was likely referring to a   report this week, but he put the word 'carnage' in quotes, which is confusing because it implies he doesn't believe the report. At the same time, though, he threatens to 'send the feds in'. Whatever be the case, the report he was referring to cites some bleak 2017 crime statistics from Chicago.
 
 There have been as many 42 homicides in Chicago so far this year. In addition, 228 people have been shot in the city so far this year, the report said. And Trump, who vowed action against gang violence in his swearing-in speech, followed up on that.

 Many tweeted wondering if this how the notoriously thin-skinned US President plans to respond to everything he dislikes or disagrees with.
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Some talked of the teetotaller President being drunk on power.
