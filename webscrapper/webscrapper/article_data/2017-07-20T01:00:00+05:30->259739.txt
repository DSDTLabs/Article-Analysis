TV actress   visited her hometown, after more than 10 months, the longest she ever stayed away from Delhi. Shivani, who now shoots for 12-14 hours a day for a daily soap, says that the one thing she misses the most in Mumbai is being with her family. "When your parents are with you, even when you return home after 18 hours of work, you don’t feel like you’ve really worked hard and you’re exhausted. I enjoy my work, but I really miss my parents," says Shivani.

  Shivani grew up in  , and whenever she gets a day off from work, she comes to Delhi to meet her family. "There is something about this city that de-stresses me. I have so many friends here and whenever I get a chance I do go to Greater Kailash I and shop. I did a commercial art course from an institute in  , so I Lajpat and GK-I have been one of my favourite places since then," says Shivani, and adds that she doesn’t mind travelling by buses and Metro while commuting in Delhi. "I used to travel in a Ladies’ Special bus when in college. Later, I tried travelling in the Metro, but I found it to be too crowded, I thought buses were better! I haven't travelled in the Metro much, as I moved to Mumbai soon after Metro started. Whenever I come to Delhi next, I'll try travelling in the Metro again," she adds.
