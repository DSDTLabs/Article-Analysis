 As per data compiled by the   here, more than 2.78 lakh passports were issued by it in 2016, just a fraction less than 2015. Of the total, almost 77,000 passports were issued to private sector employees, constituting more than 27%, while student passports made up the other biggest chunk, nearly 22%.

Three applicants in the past year applied under the category of ‘transgender’, up from two in the previous year.
 
 The visible dip in the total tally is hardly a matter of concern, said  , regional passport officer who believes 2017 will be more challenging with rules further relaxed for passport applicants by the ministry of external affairs. “2016 was a plateau year in terms of growth as we catered to peak demand in 2015. The dip in passport applicants is hardly reflective of its demand. In fact, the number of aspirants increased recently after the government relaxed application criteria. We hope our upcoming Post Office Passport Seva Kendras in   and Kolhapur and a Passport   in Solapur will help cater to the increase in applicants,” he said.
