Mysuru: After a series of protests from   of   to develop the chariot procession route near Sri  , the district administration has finally decided to concretize the road.

 A day after TOI carried a story titled, ‘Sell chariot if you cannot fix road along procession route’, deputy commissioner D Randeep directed the authorities to take up the road work on Saturday, where residents had erected a notice board near the temple asking authorities to sell the temple chariot if they were not inclined towards improving the road.
 
 The road work, which was entrusted to the public works department (PWD) commenced from Saturday. 
 
 Randeep in a press note on Saturday stated that as the famous Dodda Jatre (March 28), where five chariots are dragged through the thoroughfares of Nanjangud Town, is fast approaching, the district administration will concretize the procession route as a permanent solution.
 
 Randeep said in the first phase of the work, the 60-metre road passing through Angadi Beedhi and Patashaala Beedhi and 1.4-km (RP Road) concrete road from BN Road to RP Road will be taken up.
 
 As the road works had to be completed much before the commencement of the fair, the roads passing through Angadi Beedhi and Patashaala Beedhi from Old Taluk Office to Indian Bank Circle via SBI Circle will be closed. The roads, which witness heavy traffic movement, will be closed from January 20 to February 28 and commuters have been requested to travel on Nehru Road (Geetha Medical Circle) to the road passing near railway track and travel towards RP Road.
 
 Similarly, the busy commercial road from BN Road to RP Road will also be closed from January 20 to March 20 for road work and commuters will have to travel on an alternative road — MG Road, 18th cross, 8th Cross and road near railway tracks.
 
 Nanjangud Yuva Brigade member ‘Snake’ Basavaraju welcomed the district administration’s move and appealed that all the encroachments on the roadsides should also be removed.
