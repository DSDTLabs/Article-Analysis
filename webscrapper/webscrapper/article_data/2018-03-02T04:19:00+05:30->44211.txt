Vadodara: A resident of Dabhoi was booked under Information Technology Act for sending vulgar messages to a fashion designer who stays in the same town on Instagram.

 The complainant had given an application to register an FIR in December last year against an unidentified person who used to send these messages. On the basis of the application, police initiated a probe and zeroed down on the accused Juned Sheikh and registered an FIR against him at Dabhoi police station.
 
 Police said that Sheikh had sent vulgar messages to the 23-year-old woman on the photo sharing application Instagram on December 27 last year. The woman told her fiancé about it and the couple then tried to find out on their own who had sent them. Sheikh then changed his profile name and after sometime again changed the name to the complainant’s name.
 
 Sheikh then continued sending obscene messages to the woman who then informed her parents. Initially the woman thought that a person familiar to her was sending her such messages but when the harassment continued, she approached the police.
 
 Police investigated for two months and found out that it was Sheikh who had been sending messages to the woman. Police sources said that they are gathering evidences against Sheikh and will arrest him in next couple of days.
