LUCKNOW: A huge drop out of students in   exams has come as a shocker. Of the 10.4 lakh students who skipped UP board exams within four days, 6.2 lakh are from class X and 4.2 lakh are from class XII. Though similar trends have remained in past, this year the number of   quitting the exam is comparatively higher. 

 Sample this: The highest number of class X dropouts this year - 42,386 - has been recorded from Deoria, followed by Azamgarh where 41,141 students quit the exam. Marginally lesser than Azamgarh is Ghazipur, which recorded 41,026 absentees in class X. In class XII, Faizabad leads the pack with 29,576 candidates skipping the exam till now. This is followed by Ghazipur with 23,832 and Azamgarh with 23,636 at second and third place respectively. 
 
 Last year, 4 lakh class X and 1.3 lakh class XII candidates didn't take the examinations. "More   for class X examinations than class XII. Hence, the dropout rate in class X is more,'' said RP Mishra, state secretary, UP Secondary Teachers' Association. He added that the reason for a relatively higher dropout rate in class X this year could be CCTV cameras. 
 
 "Students in class X are innocent and immature in comparison to their counterparts in class XII. There is a psychological impact on students when they are appearing for examinations under CCTV vigil. High dropout is not something to rejoice," Mishra said. 
 
 Retired as principal from Aminabad Inter College, JP Mishra said, "Teaching has hardly happened in the schools. As a result, students are quitting the exam in mass numbers. While classes have happened just for 130-140 days, exams this year have been preponed in February. Wonder when did the students study." Teachers say weather, too, is an important factor for high dropout rate. "The winters are still on, Mornings are chilly. Girl students in remote villages skip the exam due to security and  ," said an education official.
