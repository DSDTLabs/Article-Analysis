 Sculptures and paintings of 31 different artists from across the country have also been displayed in the newly set up contemporary art gallery of the museum since March 22.
 
 According to sources, chief minister   had issued directives for expansion after inspecting the Patna Museum for over three hours on October 23 last year. He asked the officials concerned to develop a single-storey structure along the boundary wall on three sides of the museum where a majority of the artefacts would be kept.
 
 The museum has altogether 51,000 artefacts of which 923 have already been shifted to the Bihar Museum and another 39,000 are in the process of being shifted.
 
 “The artifices from 1764 onwards will be displayed in the Patna Museum and the collection before that period are to be exhibited in the Bihar Museum,” Tiwari said.
