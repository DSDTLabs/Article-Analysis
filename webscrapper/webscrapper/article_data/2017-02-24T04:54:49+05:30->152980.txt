AHMEDABAD: In a relief for state health minister  , the   on Thursday turned down the petition seeking the registration of an FIR against him for furnishing an allegedly   to the returning officer before the 2012 assembly elections.

  While rejecting the petition, Justice   observed, “I have no doubt in my mind that this writ application is nothing but an outcome of personal vendetta and actuated by political considerations. What is the writ applicant trying to prove or achieve? It is so obvious that the person against whom allegations have been levelled being an arch political rival of the writ applicant, all attempts are sought to be made to malign him.”
 
 Petitioner in this case is a social worker, Farsu Goklani, who raised the issue by pointing out that Chaudhary cleared standard XII in 2011 and then obtained the MBA degree in 2012 from a “bogus” institute.   sought direction to   police for the registration of an FIR after cops conducted a preliminary inquiry on his complaint and gave a clean chit to Chaudhary.
 
 The HC accepted the state government’s contention that the HC need not intervene in this frivolous issue and that the petitioner may file a complaint before a judicial magistrate, who will expeditiously take a decision on the complaint. Justice Pardiwala said that the HC should be circumspect in entertaining such petitions, particularly when they are actuated by bias, malice, or are politically motivated. “In a given case, having regard to the serious nature of the crime and dereliction of duty on the part of the police, the high court may be justified in issuing a writ of mandamus to register the first information report, but the case should be of such a nature and not like the one at hand,” the court said.
