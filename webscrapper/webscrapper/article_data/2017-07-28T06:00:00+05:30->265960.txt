Allu   who was supposed to fly to the US for a month-long training programme for his next film, had a change of mind. The Stylish Star has decided to fly the trainer to Hyderabad instead. Explaining the reason behind the change of plan, a source from the film’s unit said, “Bunny is playing a military man in this film and he wanted to undergo rigorous training session to get under the skin of his character. But then his co-stars in the film Action King Arjun and Sarath Kumar’s schedules were clashing,” says a source close to the actor, adding, “There are some scenes where  , Arjun and   will share the screen together. Bunny’s US tour would have affected the schedule. Hence he decided to cancel his travel plan and have the trainer fly over here instead.”
The film which marks the debut of ace writer   as director is set to hit the floors from August showcase Bunny in the role of a military man, for the first time in his career.
