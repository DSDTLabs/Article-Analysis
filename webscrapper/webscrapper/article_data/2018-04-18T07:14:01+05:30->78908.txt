NEW DELHI: Rebuffing as a “brazen lie” BJP’s allegation that   spoke about Hindu terror,   accused the ruling party of falling back on its well-worn strategy of using religion to mislead the country. 

 It said BJP was raking up the “lie” to divert attention from rising atrocities on Dalits, deteriorating women’s security and flight of scamsters like Nirav Modi. AICC spokesman   said BJP should explain finance minister Arun Jaitley’s remark that PM Modi was a “polarising person” and that religion was a “tool of opportunism” for the party. 
 
 He said these remarks were attributed to Jaitley by a US diplomat in the same Wikileaks cable BJP was using to allege that Rahul spoke about Hindu terror.
