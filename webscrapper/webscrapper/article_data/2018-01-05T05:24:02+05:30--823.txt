MUMBAI: The Sharad Pawar-led   will launch a state-wide agitation from January 16 to press for its demand for a complete loan waiver and protest against the state government's failure on all fronts. Pawar will address a farmers' rally in Aurangabad at the end of the agitation on January 31. 

 State NCP president Sunil Tatkare said despite chief minister  's announcement that loans of 89 lakh farmers will be waived before Diwali, there was no progress. "First it was Diwali, then the date was extended to November 30, and then to December 31. The government has failed to implement the scheme due to lack of commitment to tackle the agrarian crisis,'' Tatkare said.
 
 Tatkare said ever since Fadnavis took over as CM, the agriculture sector's demands have been ignored, leading to a spurt in farmers' suicides.
 
 Tatkare said Prime Minister   had assured creation of two crore jobs from the Make in India movement, but there was no progress. "While new jobs have not been created, we are told that an action plan has been drafted to cut five lakh jobs in the state government,'' he said.
 
 Meanwhile, a senior government official said it will be wrong to state that the loan waiver scheme has not been implemented. "Initially, it was slow, but now we are set to complete the entire loan waiver scheme as early as possible,'' he said. The official said it has been estimated that nearly Rs 34,000 crore of 68-70 lakh farmers will be waived. While Rs 23,000 crore has been sanctioned for 48 lakh farmers, Rs 12,000 crore has been deposited in the accounts of 30 lakh farmers. Also, seven to eight lakh farmers who will get the benefit of one-time settlement, while the amount will be Rs 6,000 crore. "One-time settlements are taking long but we will work it out as early as possible,'' he said.
