CHENNAI: The Metropolitan Transport Corporation (MTC) was able increase its operation of services on the second day of the ‘indefinite’ strike by transport corporation employees, and officials said more drivers reported for duty on Tuesday.

 According to senior MTC officials, the corporation operated 1,545 buses on Monday, and the number of services rose to nearly 1,900 on Tuesday. The corporation has a fleet strength of 3,400 buses.
 
 Incidents of stone pelting on MTC buses were reported from two areas in North Chennai – Vyasarpadi and Madhavaram. This morning miscreants threw stone on two MTC buses, while they were carrying  . Windshields of both the buses were damaged. “But for this two incidents, there is no pelting of stones on the buses in the city and its suburbs,” said the MTC sources.
 
 Transport department, coordinating with bus operators in   areas, also managed to pool in buses from districts and to bring in more than 500 buses into Chennai city by Tuesday morning. A senior transport department official said: “Most of the transport operators have sent their spare buses to the city and the vehicles have started rolling in since Monday evening. They started their operations from Tuesday morning.”
 
 The officer, who inspected the services on Rajiv Gandhi Expressway, said in bus stops did not have much crowd waiting to board buses. Another advantage with outstation buses is that they stop wherever passengers wave their hands. “It is not the bus stops alone where these vehicles are stopped. The ticket fares are in slabs of Rs 5, Rs 10 Rs 15 and Rs 20, depending on the distance. With the rounded off fares, the public are also not facing the petty change problem,” he said.
 
 The buses that came from the districts have been sent to the MTC depots, where the services are not operated by MTC crew. This has helped the waiting passengers to comfortably travel to their destinations.
