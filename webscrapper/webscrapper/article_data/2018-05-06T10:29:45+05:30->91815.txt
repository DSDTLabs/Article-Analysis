 The students have alleged that the institute has not completed the syllabus yet and about very poor food quality. “We have been raising concerns from the last twenty days over the syllabus but the director K Phani Kumar kept on saying that he will take of the issue,” P Ram said.
 
 “On Friday night the food was pathetic and so we raised the issue with Phani Kumar along with the other issue for the syllabus. But he got furious and took us to a room and thrashed us indiscriminately with a plastic pipe,” Ram said. Roopesh and Tirumala Rao who are differently abled student had to hospitalised for suffering from severe injuries.
 
 However, the institute management gave a different version to that of the students. J R Chowdary, a friend of Phani Kumar said, “The students were involved in cricket betting on   matches. Phani Kumar found about their activities and in a fit of rage beat the students,” he said. 
 
 Penamaluru police have registered a case against Phani Kumar under sections 324, 341 and 506 of the IPC and arrested him. Penamaluru inspector   said that the students were involved in betting, but amongst themselves for chocolates and biryanis and not with the bookies outside.
