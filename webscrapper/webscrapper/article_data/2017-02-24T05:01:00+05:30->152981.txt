AHMEDABAD: Water woes do not seem to end for the new west zone residents. On Thursday, TOI visited the Jodhpur and Thaltej Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) ward offices where residents had queued up to determine whether complaints they have lodged related to water supply and drainage leaks are being acted upon. 

 “Over the past two days, we have been following up with the municipal staff here to solve our water supply problems, but nothing has been done,” said a resident of Surya Puja Towers,  . Between 11 am and 2 pm, residents from 16 colonies had approached the Jodhpur ward office to register their complaints. Most of these problems were related to erratic water supply. 
 
 Ranujanagar, Riveira 30, Rathi Hospital, Surya Puja Towers, Arya Vrat Bungalows, and Jain Dharmalaya have been hit hard by these problems. “We had registered the complaint online but officials at the ward office claim that some technical work is going on because of which water supply has been affected in a few pockets,” said Preeti Nandi, a teacher. 
 
 At the Thaltej ward office, residents of Rohit Vas, Ajanta and Elora Apartments, Sudarshan Bungalows, and   had approached to register drainage and water supply complaints. “We pay taxes for these services but face AMC’s apathy,” said Pratik Vyas of Satvik Apartments.
