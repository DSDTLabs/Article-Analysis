RAJKOT: Six persons fired at least 10 rounds on the house of a local businessman Rajesh Satani on   late on Tuesday night. 

 Police have booked Ankit Shiyani, Daulatsinh Solanki, Yogi, Mahesh Shiyani,   and Chetan Solanki for the crime after Satani lodged a complaint against them with the Bhaktinagar police station. 
 
 Police said that financial dispute was the reason behind the firing. Satani had borrowed Rs 2 lakh from Mahesh Shiyani as the latter’s cousin was his friend. He had returned Rs 1.4 lakh and had to repay Rs 60,000. Rajesh had also lent Rs 90,000 to Gaurav. 
 
 On April 2, Satani and the five accused had gathered at a farmhouse on   for dinner. After the party, Ankit inquired about the remaining money with Satani. 
 
 They called up Mahesh, who had not come for dinner and he told Satani that he had to repay Rs 2.68 lakh along with compound interest. After some argument of repaying the money, the five persons kidnapped Satani in their car and took him to a farmhouse in Bhavnagar district where they thrashed him with pipes. They kept him confined for nearly three hours and then dropped him near Hudco Quarters in the city with a warning that he repay the amount on April 3.
 
 However, Satani failed to repay. On Tuesday night, the six persons reached Satani’s house at around 12:45am and started firing indiscriminately at his house and fled. Police found six empty cartridges from the spot. 
 
 They were booked for attempt to murder, kidnapping and extortion. V K Gadhvi, police inspector, Bhaktinagar, is investigating the case. 
 
 Satani has a unit named Ashwin Industries in Atika.
