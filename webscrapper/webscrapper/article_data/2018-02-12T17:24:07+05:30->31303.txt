NEW DELHI: One CRPF personnel was martyred in an ongoing gun battle with terrorists in Srinagar's Karan Nagar area after a bid to storm CRPF headquarters earlier today was successfully thwarted by security forces.

 
 "Two militants tried to barge into CRPF headquarters in the morning. They couldn't enter the headquarters but sneaked in a building close to the HQ. Five families have been evacuated. Operation is on," said IG CRPF Ravideep Sahai.
 
  
  
 The jawan, belonging to 49 Battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), suffered injuries in the gunfight and died hours later, officials said.
 
 Earlier today, an attack on CRPF headquarters was foiled after a CRPF personnel spotted two terrorists, carrying bags and AK47 rifles, approaching the camp. The terrorists managed to flee the scene after the personnel opened fire on them.
 
 "The sentry at the camp noticed two suspicious persons at around 4.30 am, carrying back packs and weapons. He challenged them and opened fire as well," a spokesman of the CRPF said.
 
 The camp is located very close to SMHS Hospital from where Lashkar- e-Taiba militant Naveed Jutt alias Abu Hanzala was freed from police custody by terrorists on February 6.
 
 A search operation was launched in the area and a contact was established with the terrorists during the search operation.
 
 Later, intermittent exchange of fire was reported from the area, following which, the CRPF moved in more troops to ensure that the militants do not escape.
 
 A gunfight ensued after personnel of CRPF Valley QAT and 23 Bn CRPF managed to corner the two terrorists who had taken shelter in a house.
