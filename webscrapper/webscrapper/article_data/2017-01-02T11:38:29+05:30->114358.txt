 In 2016, numerous protests were organised by private colleges demanding release of pending dues to the tune of Rs2,100 crore. Now, while dozens of colleges eye the government's proposal to establish private universities as an opportunity, educationalists are of the view that it will only lead to reduction in the budget allocated for fee reimbursement, which largely benefits those who cannot afford higher education by themselves.
 
 "Entry of private universities will further deteriorate education and widen the gap between public and private institutions. Regulation and curtailment of private institutions is required. The KG to PG scheme will never be implemented if the government encourages private universities," says  , an educationalist and convenor of  .
 
 Others are of the opinion that the government's move will also lead to drop in number of rural students pursuing higher education. "Education in private varsities can only be afforded by those who belong to affluent families. The government must instead strengthen the existing government-run institutions and not encourage private players in the market," said K Laxminarayana, organising secretary of Save Education Committee, which has planned programmes to protest the government's move across the state from January.
 
 A section of students from Osmania University is also opposing the Private University Bill which is expected to be cleared by the cabinet next year. Student organisations such as Telangana Vidhyarthi Vedika, Progressive Democratic Students' Union (PDSU), Students Federation of India (SFI), and All India Student Federation, are among those who have strongly objected to the proposal.
