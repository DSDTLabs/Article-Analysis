TRICHY: Activist Traffic   sat on a day’s hunger strike in   on Saturday in protest against the Union government’s failure to constitute the   and ensure   got its due share of the Cauvery. A crusader known for his battles against road safety violations, he also demanded that the Members of   representing the state resign in protest against the step-motherly treatment meted out by the Union government.

 Launching his token hunger strike protest near Amma mandapam, Traffic Ramaswamy said that the state government had failed to protect the interests of the farming community in the delta districts. “State government deserves to be dissolved as it has miserably failed to voice the decades-old demands of farmers depending on Cauvery as their lifeline. With the crops withering each day, MPs representing the state should resign immediately,” Traffic Ramaswamy told TOI. 
 
 He urged the youths to raise their voice for the agrarian community and undertake a massive voluntary protest across the state as they did against the ban on jallikattu. The social activist said that the active involvement of students may pile pressure on the authorities to constitute CMB. “Going by the claims of the state government, if cordial relationship exists between the state and central governments, why should the Centre file a clarification petition in the apex court instead of constituting the management board?” Ramaswamy asked. Ending his token strike in the evening, the activist said that he might continue to protest if no decision was taken by the state government. tnn
