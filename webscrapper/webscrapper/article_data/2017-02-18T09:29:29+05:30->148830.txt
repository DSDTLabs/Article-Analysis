KOLHAPUR: With merely 45 days to conclude the current academic session,  , Kolhapur (SUK) is yet to start its PhD and MPhil admission process for the next session.

 Board of Colleges and   director D R More said, “Due to various technical problems in the system, we could not start the admission process. The draft of the admission advertisement is ready and will be published in a few days.” In the academic year 2015-16, the SUK started its admission process for the PhD and MPhil students in August. It had received around 4,000 applications. 
 
 More said, “A committee was assigned to look after the admission process. They have not yet finished their work, which is the main reason for   in admission process. They were assigned the work of the prospectus. The advertisement draft is ready and we are waiting for the prospectus now.”
 
 An SUK official said, “Last year, the university had asked for data of guides in respective courses who are supervising the PhD students. We had asked the supervisors to inform us the number of research scholars they are supervising. We did not receive any response from most of the supervisors. Therefore, we had to keep extending the date. As of now, the university has the data which is yet to be compiled.”
 
 In July last year, the   ( ) had tweaked its guidelines for allowing professors from under-graduate (UG) colleges to offer guidance to the MPhil and PhD students. However, if the guidelines are changed, it will help the university to allow increased number of seats in the upcoming admission process. 
 
 In 2015, the UGC had issued guidelines, which restricted external supervisors from offering guidance to university students. It had asked for guides from affiliated PG institutes only and even the qualified guides from UG colleges were not allowed to guide the research scholars. This guideline had resulted in 90% decline in PhD seats in SUK.
