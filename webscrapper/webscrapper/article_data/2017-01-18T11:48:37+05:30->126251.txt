 The process will continue till Thursday and party big-wigs such as city   had a busy day conducting prabhag-wise interviews of over 200 candidates on Tuesday. In the next two days, another 600 odd aspirants will appear before them.
 
 “We are conducting interviews for all 122 seats. The response is overwhelming. For each seat, we have at least five aspirants. The interview is being held in a friendly atmosphere. Our focus in on the candidates’ people connect and their winnability,” said Sanap.
 
 Among the aspirants were siblings, cousins, close relatives, and long-time party cadre. Many women candidates also expressed interest to contest from non-reserved seats across the city — a trend that was taken positively by the panel conducting the interview.
 
 “We asked common questions to know the preparation-level of the ticket aspirants. Most of them gave satisfactory answers,” party MLA Devayani Farande said.
 
 On an interesting note, a woman aspirant failed to identify the photographs of Dindayal Upadhyay and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, while a youth said he can spend Rs 50 lakh to win the elections and a candidate failed to name the three Union ministers from Maharashtra. Most candidates were, however, happy after the interview.
 
 “It was a friendly affair. We had a nice discussion on my views about my ward and how the party will win in the civic polls. I told the panelists taking the interview that I will work for the party even if they deny me the ticket,” said  , who wants to contest the election from ward No 3 (A).
