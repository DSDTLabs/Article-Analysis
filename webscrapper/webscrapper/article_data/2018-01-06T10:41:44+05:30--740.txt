CHANDIGARH: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will hold a protest in Mansa when chief minister   launches the farm debt waiver scheme on January 7.

 AAP leader   said the party workers will show black flags to reflect resentment among the small and marginal farmers of Punjab who feel deceived and cheated by the Congress government on the so-called debt waiver scheme.
 
 “Amarinder’s false promise of waiving of debt took its first toll yesterday when a 2-acre owning farmer Sikander Singh of Sangrur, not finding his name in the list, committed suicide. My office is maintaining a list of farmers who committed suicide since Amarinder took over as the CM on March 16, 2017. Farmers have lost complete faith in the Congress government,” he said.
 
 The AAP says it has been receiving many complaints from small and marginal farmers that their names are being excluded from the debt waiver list because of political reasons as well as officials demanding bribe from them.
