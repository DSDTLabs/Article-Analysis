 "The suspects had stored photographs of their passports in their cell phones, but told the police that they had thrown away their passports. We decided to break the security codes of the phones for information about the duo," assistant inspector   said.
 
 The two suspects,   (39) and Shahzir Mamluk (52), were arrested on Monday from Goa for allegedly stealing diamond-studded   bangles, worth Rs 4.50 lakh from a jewellery store in Camp.
 
 The two were produced before the Cantonment court on Tuesday, which remanded them to one-day police custody.

 Salunkhe said even Delhi and Gurgaon police had planned to deport them. "But before they could be deported, they came out of the prison and committed another offence to avert deportation," he said.
 
 The duo has committed thefts in Gurgaon, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Mangalore in the last 10 years and had been arrested by the police units concerned, Salunkhe said.
