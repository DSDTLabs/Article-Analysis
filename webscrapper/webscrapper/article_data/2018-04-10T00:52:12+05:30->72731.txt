NEW DELHI: The Jawaharlal Nehru University Student’s Union ( ) called off its lockdown of five school and centre buildings after over 23 days on Sunday night. 

 While the union has pointed out that protests against compulsory attendance will continue in a ‘centralised manner’, the teacher’s union has started constructing outdoor class spaces for those still unwilling to enter the building.
 
 The union resolution stated that in the council meeting on Sunday, it was unanimously decided academic activities should continue, as the student community across centres were deeply concerned regarding their scholarships, the upcoming end semester examinations, and submission of thesis and dissertations.
 
  A research student had filed a petition in the   alleging that he was unable to attend classes since February and his studies were getting affected.
 
 In the meanwhile, the high court termed as “unfortunate and sad” that classes in   are being held on staircases due to an ongoing agitation. Justice   rued the joint stir by students and teachers and said the manner in which the students are being stopped is “very unfortunate.”
 
 The court was hearing a plea by five professors of JNU challenging the December 12, 2017 decision of the varsity's Academic Council making 75% attendance mandatory for students.
