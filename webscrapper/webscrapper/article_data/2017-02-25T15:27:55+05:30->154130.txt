Veteran actress   says while essaying the titular role in ' ' she almost died filming the iconic umbrella scene. 

 The Oscar-winning star made the confession on TV, saying that the stunts from the classic 1964 Disney movie were quite dangerous. 
 
  
  
 "These were all practical effects, you were on wires and stuff. Yes, there was a very dangerous day right at the end of filming when I was in this excruciatingly painful harness. I was hanging around up there for the longest time with the umbrella. I thought I felt the wire leave and drop about six inches. I was nervous and very tired. So I called down and I said, 'Excuse me, when you do let me down, could you let me down really gently, because I felt myself slip and I just don't feel too safe up here.'"   said. 
 
 The veteran   actress, who won an Academy Award for her role in the film, joked that they filmed the stunts at the end, just in case she was involved in a tragic accident.
