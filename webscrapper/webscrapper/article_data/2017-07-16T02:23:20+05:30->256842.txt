NEW DEHI: A   has asked a doctor to pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation to a woman he was treating for  ,   and  .

 The woman, a city-based lawyer, remained bedridden for two years because of several complications in the treatment of her back. “She suffered mentally, physically and financially...” observed a bench comprising forum president   and member  .
 
 On March 29, 2007, the woman had complained of severe back pain and was treated by the doctor. She was put under traction when the pain did not subside. When it became unbearable, she had to go to another hospital, where the MRI results showed that she had bone tuberculosis. The woman was bedridden for two years and claimed that it was a result of wrong diagnosis by the doctor.
 
 The doctor, however, said the allegations were baseless. An expert opinion was sought from RML Hospital. It said, “A radiological examination could have been done if the patient didn’t get relief in a month”. The forum concluded “... An MRI test was required. Therefore, the doctor has committed medical negligence”.
