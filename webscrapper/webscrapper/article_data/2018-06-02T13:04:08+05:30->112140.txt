 and Amyra Dastur’s ' ' is about a kleptomaniac and his love for a woman. The jukebox of the film has five songs composed by  , with the first of it being Rabbaru Buggala sung by Hema Chandra and penned by  . The massy number has quirky lyrics and vocals. The tune and music however fail to elevate this number which lacks the energy the lyrics demand.
Sai Charan’s Arere Arere with Ramajogayya Sastry’s lyrics picks up the pace a bit. The music of this number is what makes this number a fun one, apart from Sai Charan’s vocals. The lyrics and tune however fail to make a mark. Rendu Kalla Ninda, featuring Sri Krishna and Ramya Behara’s vocals and Bhaskarabhatla’s lyrics is a romantic number with good lyrics and vocals. The music and tune however seem to offer nothing new, seeming right out of the 90s.
 Devatalara by Sai Charan and Harini Ivaturi, featuring Ramajogayya Sastry’s lyrics just about manages to get the job done. The wedding song has music, tune, lyrics and vocals that offer nothing new yet make for a fun listen just by the energy injected in the song. Last on the album is Sarasaku Raa featuring Saketh Komanduri and Mohana Bhogaraju’s vocals and Ramajogayya Sastry’s lyrics. Another romantic number that fails to offer anything new, Sarasaku Raa still manages to be better than the rest of the songs on this album.
 The album of Rajugadu is a huge let-down, failing to inject energy or fun into its numbers. It’s hard to believe this album came from someone like Gopi Sundar who did a fabulous job with Ninnu Kori. The drab album is good enough for a one-time listen if you’re a Raj Tarun or   fan. If not, give this album a cold hard miss.
