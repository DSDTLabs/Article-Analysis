On the occasion of World Health Day, yesterday, various groups of people from Mumbai, participated in a rather unique initiative titled #JumpForHealth. This was organised by an insurance company. 

 Across the city  , transgender individuals and commuters on the Mumbai metro jumped for this very special occasion. Because, for every 10,000 jumps that the people undertook and posted them on social media, the insurance company donated one prosthetic leg to those in need.
  
 Even people on social media could jump as much as they would want and post the video online on Facebook/ Instagram/ Twitter with the hashtags #JumpForHealth and #ABCHealthInsurance with the count of jumps. People were also advised to nominate at least 3 people to take part in the initiative and spread the word.
 
 
  
 
 Last year on Word Health Day this movement started with a simple insight from an   that ‘jumping’ is one form of exercise that can be done just about anywhere and at any time and when done regularly has the power to strengthen your bones. 
 
  
  
 
 To this insight a social cause was attached, wherein for every 10,000 jumps collected, and the insurance company decided to donate one prosthetic leg to the under-privileged. The initiative witnessed participation from people across the globe and all walks of life achieving two million jumps, making a contribution of 200 prosthetic legs.
