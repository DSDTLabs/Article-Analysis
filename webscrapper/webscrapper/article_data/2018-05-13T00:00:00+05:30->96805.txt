When music composer   was approached to work on  , a film that would make a hero of Sharan, who was one of Kannada cinema’s popular character artistes, until then, he looked at it as a golden opportunity. The film, Arjun thought, would give him the freedom to experiment, given that the actor did not have a set image to conform to. “When   called me for Rambo, we were acquainted, but had not worked together. Right from day one, though, there was an easygoing camaraderie between us, which was only amplified by his implicit trust in me and my ability to deliver for his film. That love, friendship and trust has carried forward over the years, and barring maybe one or two of Sharan’s films, I have composed for all his projects and today, we are as closely-knit as family,” says Arjun, adding that their comfort level is such that he knows exactly what is needed for a Sharan film without sounding repetitive.
Their latest film is Raambo 2, on which Arjun also fills in as co-producer. And with just days to go for the film’s release, the music director is excited about his work and is grateful and happy at having forged meaningful friendships with the entire team, especially actor-filmmaker Tharun Sudhir, who has been a driving force behind all their collaborations, right from Rambo. “Tharun told me that Sharan and a few other technicians were looking at co-producing   and that he wanted me to chip in as well. I said OK then and there even without knowing what the film was about. Tharun insisted that I hear the story and then decide and when I did, I was blown away,” says Arjun.
 Like their earlier films, the music of Raambo 2 also has been making the right noise, with   being a crowd favourite. “My personal favourite, though, is Bit Hogbeda, which has been presented beautifully by  ,” says Arjun.
