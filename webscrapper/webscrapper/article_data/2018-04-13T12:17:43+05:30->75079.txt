VADODARA: A class III clerk of   taluka panchayat’s education branch was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and slapped with a fine of Rs one lakh in a seven-year-old graft case.

 The convict   had demanded a bribe of Rs 30,000 from Parsinh  , a teacher in government primary school, for clearing his medical bill of Rs three lakh. Tadvi’s wife Savita, who is also a government teacher, had undergone treatment for kidney ailment in Nadiad between 2008 and 2009.
 
 After the treatment, Tadvi presented bills amounting to Rs three lakh to claim the amount from the taluka panchayat. 
 
 However, Soni asked for a bribe of Rs 30,000 from Tadvi to clear them after which the latter approached the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) in Godhra in June 2011. The ACB sleuths laid a trap and nabbed Soni for accepting the bribe red-handed.
