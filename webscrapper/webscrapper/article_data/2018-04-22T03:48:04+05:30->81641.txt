NEW DELHI: A group of 637 academics from India and abroad have come out in solidarity with the 49 retired civil servants who recently expressed their outrage at the Kathua and Unnao rape incidents blaming Prime Minister   for belatedly speaking up on the issue and claiming his dispensation wasn’t doing enough to stop the “pattern of repeated targeted attacks on minority religious communities, Dalits, tribals and women”.

 
 In an open letter to Modi, academics like   and writers like  , said they were expressing their “deep anger and anguish” over the events in Kathua and Unnao and the aftermath of these events including the PM’s “own prolonged (and by now familiar) silence that was broken only recently with wholly inadequate, platitudinous, and non-specific assurances of justice for the victims.”
 
 Last week, PM Modi had condemned the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Kathua and the alleged rape of a teenager by a   in Unnao, and said the culprits will be brought to justice. Thereafter, during his recent visit to London, he insisted that rapes should not be politicised.
 
 Citing several examples of mob attacks and lynchings, the letter said, “Many of these events have occurred in states with   governments, and all of them after the BJP assumed power at the Centre. This is not to associate violence exclusively with your party and with state governments presided over by your party. But there is an undeniable association with the ruling dispensation”.
 
 It ends by saying, “We send you this letter because it is our duty; so that we are not guilty of silence; and so that callousness and cowardice might draw the line at the broken body of a little girl and the rape of a young woman.”
