Mangaluru: 

 The BJP on Thursday shot off a 10-point questionnaire to AICC President  , demanding that he answer them during his ongoing tour of Karnataka.
 
 Aimed at countering Rahul on his assertion that he is not being allowed to speak in Parliament over contentious issues even for 15 minutes, BJP national spokesperson   released answering the questions will not take as much time as that is all the time the Congress chief had the capacity to speak solo.
 
 Asserting that elections is all about giving account to the electorate, Patra told reporters that while PM Narendra Modi has already offered to give his ‘hisaab’ before the general elections in 2019 and demanded the same from Rahul on his party’s governance in Karnataka. 
 
 “Jahan Jahan tum (Rahul) jaaoge (in Karnataka), hum (BJP) peecha nahin chodenge,” Patra said.
 
 The questions ranged from spiralling farmers’ suicides in Karnataka to atrocities to abject neglect of development needs of Bengaluru to drop in the state capital’s Swachh Bharat rankings.
 
 “Rahul, who is harping on RTI Act as Congress’ gift to India, should answer why his government in Karnataka weakened the Sakala Act introduced by the previous BJP government,” Patra demanded. Rahul, who is ridiculing Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao campaign of NDA government, should answer for the 800 plus   of   in Karnataka, 7,523 murders of women in the state and 3857 instances of sexual assault on them in last 5 years, he said.
 
 Drastic fall in health and education indices in Karnataka also hold a mirror to mis-governance of Siddaramaiah, he said. 
 
 Patra wondered if the AICC chief who has no belief in Constitutional bodies and authorities including the President at least believed his own CM? “Is this why Siddaramaiah is contesting from two seats as he isn’t sure of his own governance compared to one of BJP state chief B S Yeddyruappa,” he noted.
