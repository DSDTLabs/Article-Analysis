NEW DELHI: Amid signs of a rift between   and the   government in   led by P Narayansamy, the home ministry doesn’t seem to be in full agreement with the Lt Governor who claimed that she could choose to ignore the state legislature if she wanted and that she would like to have a say in the budget. 

 TOI spoke to some officials of MHA who said the Centre would go by the rule book and the laws governing Puducherry.
 
 Officials said Puducherry is a Union territory and the rules of business make the   the ‘administrator’ but the chief minister and legislative House also have powers.
 
 “Administrator has to be consulted in all important decisions irrespective of if he/she agrees or not and then the matter has to be reported to the home ministry,” said an official. Bedi had claimed in an interview on Tuesday that having the power of an administrator “she may or may not consult with the Legislature, depending on how compelling are the circumstances.” She also said she is going to make changes in the new budget for the UT. However, Bedi could not be reached for her comments.
