BHAGALPUR: High security alert has been sounded in Bhagalpur and Banka as well as adjoining districts in view of the huge gathering of Lord Shiva devotees at Sultanganj (Bhagalpur) and on the ‘kanwaria’ trek routes (mostly in Banka district) for the monthlong Shrawani fair that began on July 8.

 The alert followed the terror attack in which seven Amarnath Yatra pilgrims, including five women, were killed and many others injured in Jammu & kashmir on Monday night.
 
 Lakhs of pilgrims from across the country as well as neighbouring Nepal and Bhutan travel to this region to pay obeisance to Lord Shiva at the Baidyanath Temple at Deoghar in Jharkhand in the holy month of Shrawan.
 
 They gather at Sirghat in Sultanganj on the first leg of their journey to collect holy water from the Ganga. They then trek barefoot for nearly 105km with ‘kanwars’ and holy water on their shoulder. A major part of the trek route falls under Bhagalpur and Banka districts even though the temple is located in Deoghar.
 
 At the temple in Deoghar, the devotees pour the holy water on the Shivalinga, a ritual that is believe to bring blessing from Lord Shiva.
 
 According to Bhagalpur police range DIG Vikas Vaibhav, high security alert has been sounded in the Banka, Naugachhia (police district) and Bhagalpur districts in the backdrop of the terror attack in J&K. The SPs of the three districts have been asked to keep vigil on antisocial and antinational elements.
 
 “Orders have been given to increase the deployment of security personnel... Intelligence sleuths in the civvies have been assigned round-the-clock duty at Sultanganj and the ‘kanwaria’ routes,” the DIG told TOI on Tuedsay, adding CCTV cameras have also been installed at strategic points to monitor the movement of people.
 
 Public address systems and banners are being used at Sultanganj and on the ‘kanwaria’ routes to caution the pilgrims against suspicious objects and humans. “We are on high alert,” the DIG said.
