Rajkot: Two families from Lathi village in Amreli taluka have been sitting on fast in front of the mamlatdar’s office since one week to protest against the work of deepening of a village pond initiated by Surat-based diamond baron Savji Dholakia. 

 They allege that the mud from the pond is being dumped in and around their farms as a result of which they have been unable to cultivate on the land. They further claim that because of the dumping of mud, water does not flow out of their land naturally and gets stagnated in their farms. 
 
 Ramesh Raghavji Gohil and Jenti Lakhman Maru are fasting since last Monday over work on the Harekrishna pond. 
 
 Gohil said, “The mud is being dumped in the periphery of our agriculture land. As a result, there are mounds of 8-10 feet tall surrounding our farms. The water from rains and canals get stagnated in my land as there is no outlet for it. We have been not able to cultivate crop since past one year.”
 
 The family claims that nearly 15 bigha land has been rendered useless and they are left with no income source. 
 
 Lathi mamlatdar R K Manat said, “We will construct a canal so that water flows easily from the farm.” However, agitating farmers said that the solution suggested by the mamlatdar was not a workable solution. 
 
 Diamond baron Savji Dholakia could not be contacted for comment.
