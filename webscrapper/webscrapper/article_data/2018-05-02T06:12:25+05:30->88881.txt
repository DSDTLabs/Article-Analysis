PANAJI: The   together with the   is considering providing solar lamps to families living in remote forest areas who still don’t have access to power.

 Despite the government stating that the country has achieved 100% electrification, over 80 families, spread out across forest areas in north and south Goa, are yet to receive electricity connections. These houses are scattered across Sanguem, Sanvordem, Cotigao and Molem in South Goa and Valpoi in North Goa. Only around nine of these houses are situated in Valpoi, with most located in south Goa.
 
 With permission from the forest department, a requirement in wildlife protected areas, solar lamps will be provided to interested households. 
 
 Chief electrical engineer N N   said taking connections to the houses, which are scattered, will not only involve huge investment, but is not feasible. “The same lines provided to other areas in the village will have to be extended to these households and in case a tree falls in the forest, it could affect supply to the entire area,” he said, adding that solar power is the best solution for these households.
 
 “We will start with solar lamps and, in future, we can consider solar panels too,” Reddy said. Some of the houses are not used throughout the year with families staying there only for a few months in the year during the cashew season.
 
 Around two years ago, 19 homes in   were electrified. The electricity department had to take precautions not to disturb the wildlife in the area. They laid underground cables instead of overhead cables and weren’t permitted to fix streetlights.
