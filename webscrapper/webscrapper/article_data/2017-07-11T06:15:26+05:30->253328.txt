HYDERABAD: In a setback for   (TechM), Justice M S   of the   on Monday issued notices to the state of  , its labour department officials as well as TechM, directing them to respond to the allegations of unlawful retrenchments of software engineers and other professionals.

 The judge gave them three weeks to file their replies to the contentions raised in a writ petition filed by   and three other retrenched employees of TechM, who brought to the notice of the court the issue of lay-offs of IT employees prevailing in the software sector.
 
 The counsel for the retrenched employees informed the court that the TechM management was resorting to large scale, illegal retrenchment of its employees in Hyderabad.
 
 He also told the court that the human resources (HR) department of the company was pressurising employees to tender their resignations in a manner that made it it look like they quit voluntarily.
 
 The petitioners had earlier approached the joint commissioner of labour,  , under whose jurisdiction the company falls, complaining against the high handed and illegal methods being adopted by the company to get rid of its employees.
 
 But even as the conciliation process was set in motion by the labour department, the company went ahead and terminated the employees without waiting for the outcome of the conciliation process, showing scant regard for the law and the government, the counsel for the techies told the court.
 
 The counsel for the laid-off te chies also informed the court that this action of the company ran contrary to Section 47(2) of the Telangana Shops and Establishments Act, 1988.
 
 Since the exemption from this provision of the Act to IT companies, given by the state government vide GO MS No 22, has been stayed by the High Court itself in another petition, the counsel sought a direction to the labour department and TechM to forthwith reinstate the retrenched employees pending the conciliation proceedings.
