TRICHY: With the first batch of students set to graduate from   National Law School (TNNLS) this year, the four-year-old institution at Srirangam has planned to introduce postgraduate programmes.

 Apart from offering specialization in intellectual property rights, corporate and securities law, the one-year LLM programme will offer specialization in natural resources law. TNNLS will be the only second university in the whole country to offer a course in natural resources after   (TERI) New Delhi.
 
 “LLM would deal with every natural resource, like water, land and nuclear energy separately and the focus would be to understand and get more sustainable use of natural resources which are essential for livelihood,” said   Patta Joshi, assistant professor at TNNLS who was part of the curriculum framing.
 
 She said that they are attempting to introduce a course that might not be offered elsewhere but remains relevant in the present context. “The University of Petroleum and Energy Studies (UPES) at Dehradun offers LLM in energy law but it was only a part of the natural resources law. However, we have taken a very comprehensive setup,” she said.
 
 “PhD courses would commence from this year,” vice-chancellor   told TOI. She said that admissions for the UG and PG courses would purely be based on the Common Law Entrance Test ( ) scheduled for March this year. This is unlike in the government law colleges in the state where higher secondary marks are counted for admissions.
 
 As 50 percent of the seats were reserved for students from Tamil Nadu, the college expected a sizeable number of students from the rural parts of the state, she said.
