NEW DELHI:   on Monday approached the   (SAT) against a  , which had banned the Mukesh Ambani-led firm from equity derivative trading for one year and had asked it to disgorge nearly Rs 1,000 crore in an alleged fraudulent trading case.

 The tribunal is likely to hear RIL's appeal on May 3 to decide on admission and further hearing, sources said. In a nearly 10-year-old case, capital markets regulator Sebi on March 24 had banned   and 12 others from equity derivatives trading for one year, while accusing the company of making "unlawful gains".
 
 Besides, RIL was asked to disgorge Rs 447 crore, along with an annual interest of 12% since November 29, 2007, which itself would be over Rs 500 crore, taking the total disgorgement amount to nearly Rs 1,000 crore. 
 
 The case relates to alleged fraudulent trading in the F&O space in the securities of RIL's erstwhile listed subsidiary Reliance Petroleum (RPL). Soon after Sebi's order, RIL had termed the regulator's directions as "unjustifiable sanctions" and had said it would challenge the directive. The company felt the trades were examined by Sebi were genuine and bonafide transactions and were carried out keeping the best interest of the company and its shareholders in view.
