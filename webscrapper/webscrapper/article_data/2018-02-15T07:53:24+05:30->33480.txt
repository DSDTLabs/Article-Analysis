BHOPAL: Celebratory firing turned a wedding into tragedy in Gwalior as a   a little after midnight on Tuesday.

 Gunshots were fired at a wedding organised by a Bhadoria family at Soda Ka Kuwan area of Gwalior. The victim, seven-year-old Saijal, was attending the party with her parents. She was shot in the abdomen and collapsed, bleeding heavily. She was taken to a private hospital, where doctors referred her to a government hospital. The child died after an hour.
 
 A pall of gloom descended at the wedding venue. Police have questioned many families about the firing, but are yet to identify the shooter. Investigators suspect the shot was fired from a licensed revolver in the air. The bullet hit a high tension wire and ricocheted.
 
 They are examining video footage of the ceremony to identify the shooter. A case of murder has been lodged against ‘unidentified’ person. They are looking for people who left the venue right after the shooting.
 
 The Gwalior-Chambal region has witnessed several such deaths in recent years — Bhind district recorded a dozen in 2015 — despite a ban on celebratory firing. There is an old saying in Chambal that “from a person’s birth till death, gunshots mark every important event of life... Even when a person dies and cremated, guns are fired to awaken the spirit of death”. With such a gun culture, the administration has not been able to check the use of weapons in this region. 
 
 In 2011, the Madhya Pradesh government banned celebratory firing in Chambal and warned that offenders will be exiled, charged under National Security Act (NSA) and lose their gun licence, but to no avail. Since most of the shootings happen at weddings and family events, the victims and shooters are related and they strike a compromise. In Shivpuri last year, a police officer was accidentally shot in the head and killed in celebratory firing on Holi.
