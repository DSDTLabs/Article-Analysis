NOIDA: Nearly 72 real estate companies together owe the   a whopping Rs 9,993 crore as on March 31, 2017 against land allotted to them in various housing projects in the city. 

 Among the top three   are Unitech (Rs 4,800 crore), Amrapali (Rs 1076.81 crore) and Aims Max Gardenia Developers Pvt Ltd (Rs 1055.63 crore). This information was uploaded on Noida Authority’s website www.noidaauthorityonline.com on Friday.
 
 “We have uploaded the complete details of all 91 builders,” Amit Mohan Prasad, Noida Authority CEO, told TOI. “This will not only ensure the welfare of the homebuyers but also protect the interests of prospective buyers. The new buyers will get know that will not issue completion and occupancy certificates to defaulters,” he explained. “Making the list public will also put moral pressure on the builders to complete projects and pay their outstanding dues to us,” he added.
 
 “Lack of funds is causing a huge lull in development projects. We cannot afford to disregard this issue any more. Besides, thousands of homebuyers are running from pillar-to-post to obtain possession of their homes. In an attempt to streamline things and a first step towards transparency, we have uploaded these details,” he said.
 
 Unitech has already applied for surrendering part of its Rs 2,500 crore group housing land deals in three projects in Noida. The realtor has applied to surrender 219 acres of the 466 acres of three group housing plots allotted to it in 2007 in sectors 96, 97, 98, 112 and 117. 
 
 Asked if this would close their dues with the Authority, Unitech executive vice-president (real estate development) Rana Rajesh Kumar confirmed, “Once processed, this will make Unitech debt-free when it comes to the Noida Authority.” 
 
 On a positive note, the list also displays 19 up-to-date projects that are on schedule. These include Prateek Realtors in Sector 120, Logix Infrastructure in Sector 137, ATS Township in Sector 104, Gulshan Homez in Sector 137, JM Housing in Sector 76, Supertech in Sector 137, Purvanchal in Sector 137, Panscheel in Sector 137, Orion Infrabuild in Sector 78, Mahagun in Sector 78, Ajnara in Sector 74 and Three C Estate in Sector 143. 
 
 According to officials, the Authority is chasing an outstanding amount of nearly Rs 16,000 crore. Defaulters include commercial, institutional and industrial allottees.
