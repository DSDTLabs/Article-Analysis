’s latest film ‘Raees’ has been raking in the moolah since its worldwide release on January 25, 2017. While the film is said to have zoomed past the 100-crore mark in the domestic 
 , it has also set cash registers ringing in other corners of the globe. According to latest reports, the film has officially been crowned as the highest earning 
  weekend grosser in Singapore, with its weekend collections pegged at an estimated USD 226,000 (Rs 1.52 crore).

 
 
 Last year, Shah Rukh’s action-romance film ‘Dilwale’ had reportedly become the highest grossing and the only Bollywood film to cross $ 1 million mark at the box-office in Singapore.
 
  
  
 ‘Raees’ raked in an estimated total of USD 6.7 million (Rs 45.56 crore) at the overseas box-office over the first four days of its release. 
 
 
  
 Meanwhile, back on home soil, ‘Raees’ went on to record the highest ever weekend collection in January besides witnessing the highest ever day collection with two or more releases.
 
 
 The Rahul Dholakia-directed movie has been doing brisk business since day one of its release. Critics are crediting the film’s power-packed performances, hard-hitting dialogues and the foot tapping music for the feat. ‘Raees’ is also being applauded for Shah Rukh’s return to celluloid as the angry young man after more than two decades.
