TANDA (HOSHIARPUR): A man set his neighbour’s house on fire in Tanda on Sunday morning, killing an 11-month-old boy and mother. The child’s grandmother  , brother   (11), and sister   (8) suffered 80% burns in the blaze. Their condition was said to be critical at the time the story was filed.

 The accused, Joginder Singh Jinda, is on the run. According to police, he set the house on fire as he had a grudge with his neighbour   and his father, Lachhman Singh. The father-son duo were out of town when Jinda set the house ablaze. 
 
 A day before he set house on fire, Jinda had gotten into an argument with Lachhman over his bringing women to his house. Before the fire brigade could arrive on the scene, neighbours took out the family. While the baby died on the spot, grandmother Gurdev Kaur breathed her last in his hospital. 
 
 The police are yet to ascertain how the accused set the house on fire. They suspect he entered the house around 6am. Hoshiarpur   J Elanchezian said they had formed teams to trace the accused. The SSP added that preliminary questioning of the victim’s family revealed thay they were objecting to Jinda bringing different women to his house frequently and that was why he nursed a grudge against them.
