HYDERABAD:   are no longer just a procedure, but an experience. The concept is fast becoming popular among mothers-to-be in the city, courtesy corporate hospitals that throw in add-ons to give normal deliveries a swish makeover.

 From curating a candlelight dinner for the expectant parents on the eve of the delivery to decorating the   room depending on the gender of the child post-delivery, hospitals are going all out to woo patients. The primary objective, many say, is to encourage women to opt for normal deliveries instead of C-section.
 
 
  
 
 "There are a number of hospitals offering such facilities, be it freedom of choosing the birthing position and birthing companion or letting the couple play their favourite music in the delivery room. The point is to make the expectant mother feel good about the whole experience," said Dr  , senior consultant obstetrician, Fernandez Hospitals. The 'positive birthing experience' can go a long way in building the mother-child bond as well, she added.
 
 Options like under-water birth and epidural injections for normal deliveries are also picking up. Also, unlike the traditional way of treating pregnancy as a disease that mandates complete rest, many centres are stressing on treating it as an active phase of life. They now insist that women do light exercises and pre-natal yoga right up to a few hours before birth to ease the process. 
 
 Of course, none of this comes cheap. While the cost of delivery packages have seen a sharp rise over the last few years, these fresh experience add-ons have only pushed rates further northwards. For instance, the underwater birth costs between 1 lakh and 2 lakh in different hospitals. And the other frills add to the costs by thousands.
