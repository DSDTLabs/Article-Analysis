  Bareilly: In a state-wide crackdown, police have booked 676 persons in 93 different cases for anti-liquor protests across UP. Agitators, mostly women, have been hitting the streets in aggressive mobs, attacking, burning and ransacking liquor outlets.      According to police, Bareilly region reported the maximum cases of anti-liquor uprising in the state. As many as 22 incidents were reported from the four districts - Shahjahanpur, Pilibhit, Badaun and Bareilly. A total of 122 people were booked and 11 arrested.      In Bareilly, Shahjahanpur and Moradabad, protestors, mainly women, not only ransacked but also torched several liquor outlets. Agitators said numerous complaints were made to local police in the past about nuisance due to the presence of liquor shops but little came help their way. Two BJP municipal councillors, one each in Bareilly and Moradabad, were also booked for inciting violence.      Meanwhile, the police administration has been on its toes with director general of police (DGP), Lucknow, Javeed Ahmed, leading the crackdown against violators. The protests have gained momentum in the past three-four days with mobs vandalising even authorised liquor shops in several districts of the state. Outlets trying to relocate to residential areas also faced violence at the hands of locals.      The Supreme Courtâ€™s order restricting sale of liquor within 500 metres from state and national highways has badly hit the liquor industry. While the state government is exploring ways to mitigate the effect, industry experts believe the cumulative revenue losses would run into hundreds of crores. According to data released by the excise department, Bareilly zone is likely to lose Rs 222 crore in revenue following the ban.
