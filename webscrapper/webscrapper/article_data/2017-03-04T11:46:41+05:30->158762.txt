KOLHAPUR: Eminent Ambedkarite writer and thinker   (61) was stabbed to death at his residence in Arihant Colony here on Friday afternoon following an argument over payment for furniture at his house.

 The police said Kirawale was stabbed three or four times by Pritam Patil (37), who runs a furniture shop with his father. Patil is on the run. Kirawale retired last year as head of the Marathi department of Shivaji University here. He wrote extensively on Babasaheb Ambedkar and on the plight of the dalit community.
 
 He was also the head of the university’s Babasaheb Ambedkar Study Centre.
 
 Kirawale had extensively researched rural life and had compiled a dictionary of words used in rural areas. Deputy superintendent of police Harsh Poddar said Kirawale’s wife, Kalpana, witnessed the murder. “As per primary investigations, Patil killed Kirawale in a fit of rage. Patil was demanding dues for the furniture work he had done at Kirawale’s house.”
 
 Kalpana told the police Patil came to their house around 3.30 pm and picked up a quarrel over the dues. While fleeing after stabbing Kirawale, he met one of his acquaintances, Vijaysinha Mohansinha Rajput, and told him of the stabbing. Rajput immediately called up the police. Patil lives near Kirawale’s house and the families know each other.
 
 As news of the murder spread, several workers of the Ambedkarite movement gathered outside his residence. Special inspector general of police (  range) Vishwas Nangare-Patil assured the crowd a speedy investigation would be conducted. Kirawale’s supporters, however, threw stones, damaged cars and broke the windows panes of Patil’s house.
