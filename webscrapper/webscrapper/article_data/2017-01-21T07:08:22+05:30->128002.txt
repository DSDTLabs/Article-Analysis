 Started on a modest note 32 years ago, the Patna Book Fair has become very popular among the publishers as well as people of the state. Earlier, this book fair used to be held in the month of November-December, but the dates this year had to be deferred due to the 350th Prakashotsava celebrations of Guru   at Gandhi Maidan.
