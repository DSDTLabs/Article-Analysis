  Deven says though there were discussions to turn the show into a film, they had to shelve the idea since nothing came out of it.
  
  
 
  
  "We had a couple of discussions with our writer and producer regarding this, contemplating whether we can try to make a film out of it. But then it didn't work out the way we wanted to so we thought to do something else with it," Deven told PTI.
  
  The show revolved around the life of an upper class Sarabhai family, consisting of Indravadan(Shah) and his wife Maya (Pathak), who live in an apartment with their younger son Rosesh ( ).
  
  It also featured Sahil (Raghavan) as their older son and his wife Monisha, played by Rupali Ganguly. The show became extremely popular for its wit and running gags about its characters, from Rosesh's poetry to Maya's sophistication.
  
  
 
  
  "Sarabhai vs Sarabhai" is now set to return as a web series and Deven says some new characters will be added.
  
  "We are still in the process, it is too soon to talk about it but may be we will take a time leap and carry on. We will retain a few qualities and of course all the successful characters. We add a couple of more new characters. It is going to come out very soon," he said.
  
  Deven, meanwhile, is all geared up for the release of his feature film directorial debut, "Commando 2". The action-drama is a complete switch from comedy, which is what the he is usually known for.
