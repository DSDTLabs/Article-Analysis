LUCKNOW: An investigation by   that surfaced on Monday puts   across the state in the dock over use 102 and 108  .

 In a random check of data related to the ambulances, the   office found   in 30 districts have been verifying trips made by the vehicles without a reality check. The NHM, which randomly monitors the movement of 108 and 102 ambulances found the number of trips by an ambulance in test districts had increased drastically.
 
 On an average, an ambulance makes 12-15 trips per day and 20 trips in a day are rare. In April 2016, the number of ambulances that made 20 trips or more per day was 100. When the exercise was conducted once again in March this year, authorities found number of such ambulances had increased to 2,000. As per rule, at least 10% of ambulance movement activity is to be monitored by CMO in each district. Finding the rise in number unusual, NHM officials picked up vehicles whose trips were verified by the CMOs and came across discrepancies hinting at foul play. 
 
 As per the report, (a copy of which is with TOI), four kind of problems have been noticed. The same ambulance has been seen at two places, GPS locations and data don’t match, there is unusually long distance between pickup and drop points and points of pickup and drop do not match. Also, names of beneficiaries are common in many cases.
 
 Confirming the details, Mission Director, NHM UP, Alok Kumar said, “The matter has been brought to the notice of the director general who has been asked to ask the CMOs to explain why such discrepancies existed. Their failure to justify the extra trips would invite penal action.”
