AMRITSAR: Demonetization has taken a toll on an old election tradition in Amritsar that involves weighing a candidate with coins and donating the same amount as  .

 Amritsar-based currency exchanger Vijay Kumar said it was because of this traditions that there was an “immense demand“ for coins in the previous elections.
 
 “But, this year, we don't have coins and currency notes, and even demand from supporters is less,“ Vijay said. A BJP worker, Naresh Gupta, said a candidate would collect Rs 1 lakh in a day from the funds received with the tradition alone.
 
 “It used to be fun watching a thin candidate losing out to a heavier one in terms of money collected. Apart from demonetisation, fears of action by the   have made candidates play it safe this time,“ said Gupta.
 
 Not all seems to have been lost though. This time, however, the tradition is still on at some localities.However, instead of coins, supporters are using sweets to weigh candidates.
 
 A Congress supporter, Shiv Bansal, said an average-built candidate normally weighed around 17,000 coins of Re 1. “It was more of a tradition, which has now taken out the charm of election-time euphoria. This act is visible, but several other practices are still continuing,“ he said.
