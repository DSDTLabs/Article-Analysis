HYDERABAD: A 70-year-old farmer K Anantaiah was bludgeoned to death by his son on their farm in   under   limits of Cyberabad commissionerate on Friday. At 7am, Anantaiah's relative Sattayya saw him lying dead in a pool of blood and alerted family members. 

 Anantaiah and Sattaiah had been herding sheep on the former's agricultural fields for a week. On Thursday night, Anantaiah had dinner at home and carried food for Sattayya who was watching over the herd. "They slept close to the sheep enclosure. Sattayya woke up in the morning and found Anantaiah dead," Shabad SI M Ravi Kumar told TOI. 
 
 During preliminary probe, police found that Anantaiah's elder son Subhanaiah had come to his father's fields early Friday and killed him after hitting him on the head with a stick. "Though Sattayya has claimed that he was in deep sleep and did not hear anything, we suspect he is lying out of fear," the police said.
 
 Anantaiah's wife Anantamma and his younger son Sreenu told police that Subhanaiah had been eyeing the two-acre land owned by his father. Police booked a murder case under section 302 of the   and took Subhanaiah into custody.
