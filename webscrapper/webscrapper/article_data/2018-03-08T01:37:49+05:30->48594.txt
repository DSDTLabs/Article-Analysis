NEW DELHI: The highways ministry has planned a mega event to mark the inauguration of   stretch of NH-24 and Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE). Highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said that there would be a major road show by the Prime Minister riding an open vehicle on a stretch of the highway.

 “These two projects will be big gifts to Delhi. They will reduce the traffic burden. We are planning a major road show. We will request the PM to take a ride on both the highway stretches. We have sought time from him to inaugurate these two stretches and lay the foundation stone for  ,” Gadkari told reporters.
 
 Sources said that completion of these two major road projects gains significance considering that   had laid the foundation stone after coming to power. Widening of the 8km stretch of NH-24 between Nizamuddin bridge and UP border to 14 lanes is getting completed one year before the official deadline. Secondly, even the construction of the 135-km EPE is set for completion in record time despite several protests by farmers against land acquisition.
 
 Though EPE was planned in 2006, the work was awarded after the NDA government came to power. NHAI awarded the work under the government funding mode for faster completion. “Had farmers not protested, we would have completed the entire stretch within 500 days. We will make this access controlled expressway a model for the country since it will be the first such stretch to be built by the Centre,” said an official.
 
 This will also be the first toll road in the country where commuters will pay for the stretch they travel.
