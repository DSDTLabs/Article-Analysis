PANAJI:   and   are likely to miss out on a place in the expanded Indian Super League ( ) after failing to submit the bid documents before the deadline on Thursday.

 Six organizations, including Mohun Bagan and East Bengal, had picked up the invitation to bid (ITB) papers, but only Bengaluru FC and the Tata Group are understood to have submitted the necessary papers, making their intention to play in the ISL clear.
 
 The two Kolkata giants had sought more time to submit the documents, pending clarity from the organizers on franchise fee and continuing to play in Kolkata, which is already home to Atletico de Kolkata. But, if a brief statement from the organizers is any indication, no exception is being made for the legacy clubs.
 
 "The invitation to bid tender process for inclusion of new teams in the Football   Development Limited (FSDL) organised Indian Super League comes to a close with the submission timeline ending at 5pm, today," the organizers said in a statement on Thursday.
 
 FSDL have appointed external validator Ernst & Young to go through the bids evaluation procedurals over the coming week and seek more documents from the interested parties, if deemed necessary.
