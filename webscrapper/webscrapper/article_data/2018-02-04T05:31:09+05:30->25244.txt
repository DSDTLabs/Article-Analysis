MUMBAI: Andhra Pradesh CM and TDP chief  , who has expressed his disgruntlement with the Union budget, called up   president Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday.

 Leaders of the two NDA allies exchanged views on the BJP’s stance towards partners, said Sena sources. Bengal CM Mamata Bannerjee too has been dialling Matoshree and vice versa over the last few months, the sources added. TNN
 
 
 
 Naidu called up Thackeray and said that the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) was sore over the “stepmotherly” treatment meted out by the   (BJP) to its regional friends.
 
 The Naidu-Thackeray phone talk comes close on the heels of Naidu’s statement on Friday, after Union finance minister   presented the budget in the Lok Sabha, that the Centre had given “shoddy treatment” to Andhra while earmarking allocations in the budget.
 
 Naidu told Thackeray that the general mood in the TDP is to sever ties with the BJP and contest the 2019 Lok Sabha and the state assembly polls on its own strength, sources in the Sena said.
 
 At a Sena conclave held in Mumbai last month, Thackeray had announced that his party would go solo for the 2019 parliamentary and assembly elections. The Sena has for the last two years been lambasting the BJP on a slew of issues, including farmers’ woes, demonetization, GST, price rise and the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train.
 
 The Shiv Sena had contested the 2014 assembly polls and the 2017   polls on its own. Shiv Sena joined the BJP-led state government after the assembly polls and has not withdrawn as a partner from the Centre or state. The death of Dharma Patil, a Dhule farmer, last week over meagre payment of land compensation has sparked a fresh row between the BJP and the Sena.
