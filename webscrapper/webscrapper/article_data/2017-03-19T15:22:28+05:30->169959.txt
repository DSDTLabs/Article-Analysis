Singer-turned-designer   is adamant there will never be another full   reunion, insisting it's time they all moved on. 

 Fans of the 'Wannabe' hitmakers have been hoping for another get-together ever since the '90s pop stars regrouped for the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics, but initial plans for a comeback to mark the band's 20th anniversary last year never materialised. 
 
 Discussions stalled after Victoria, who has since established herself as a top fashion designer, and Melanie Chisholm both declined to return to the line-up, leaving Geri Horner,  , and Emma Bunton to pursue a future as a trio, renaming themselves GEM. 
 
 However, their efforts to return to the stage also hit a stumbling block, after Geri became a mother for a second time in January. 
 
 Now Victoria has made it absolutely clear the time for a   Girls comeback has passed, and she is perfectly happy with their legacy as it stands. 
 
  
  
 "There won't be a reunion because I think that when we performed at the Olympics, it was so great, and that was us celebrating everything that we'd achieved," she explained to US breakfast show 'Today.' 
 
 "I still talk to all the other girls, we're still very close, but I think you need to know when it's time to actually say, 'That was great, we achieved a lot,' and everybody moves on." 
 
 Asked if that means her Posh Spice persona is gone for good, she smiled, "I'll always be Posh!"
