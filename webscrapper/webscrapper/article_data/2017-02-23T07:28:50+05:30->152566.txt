LUCKNOW: On the  ,   and politicians were out in strength making their last pitch for votes in a constituency that will test the  . Flags, banners, riders with bandanas on motorbikes and atop SUVs were finally out, crowding streets.

 Tuesday's din and confusion added a dash of polltime colour to the dusty Bundelkhand landscape.
 
 Otherwise, canvassing here has been dull, courtesy the EC's myriad prohibitions. Banda town, one of the district headquarters in this backward region, votes Thursday . This district, which includes three other seats -Tindwari, Baberu and Naraini -is the single largest known for farmer suicides in UP. Bikers drive around with mostly SP flags, distributing leaflets with Akhilesh-Rahul snaps and their poll promises.
 
 But it's not difficult to spot   colours. Flags spot Congress colours. Flags of both parties flutter together atop SUVs leading the procession. Vivek Singh of Congress is the alliance nominee from Banda, but those spreading his message are mostly SP workers. Banda will test the SP-Congress alliance.
 
 Singh has an edge in the close fight against BSP's Madhusudan Kushwaha. He represents Mayawati aide Naseemuddin Siddiqui, who belongs here. If Muslim votes split between the alliance and BSP, BJP's Prakash Dwivedi stands to gain. But if they consolidate, it's advantage alliance. With backward communities in good numbers, the SP-Congress rival is BSP.
 
 It's not without reason that a local businessman jokes: “We (Muslims) decide who wins here,“ as he chats with a friend keen on a BJP victory . Congress rides on SP's strength. While workers of both parties don't mind accepting the decision of their leaders to work together, supporters have accepted the alliance. “It's (the tie-up) a good thing that's happened,“ says Mahendra Gupta in Naraini constituency of Banda.
