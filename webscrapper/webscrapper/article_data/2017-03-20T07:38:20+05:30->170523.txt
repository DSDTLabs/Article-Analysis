MEERUT: The Akhil Bharatiya Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti’s (ABJASS) planned agitation in Delhi on Monday has been postponed by a fortnight, after a meeting with Haryana Chief Minister,  , where an agreement was reached. According to community leaders, 10,000 western UP Jats were prepared to go to Delhi in buses, trucks and tractors to support the agitation of Jats from Haryana.

 Now with Monday’s mega protest being called off, the regional leaders are saying that their support will continue. “We are totally ready for the next phase. We were ready today also. Around 5,000 people from   alone were prepared to join the agitation in Delhi. This number will only grow. We will watch closely if the promises made today are kept. Otherwise, the protest will again pick up speed and will be more powerful than ever before,” said Satendra Chikara, Shamli district president, ABJASS.
 
 The Jat leaders, following the meeting with CM Khattar, said that for now they were satisfied, but the movement will intensify if there is any delay in meeting the demands. “Our demands were agreed on by the CM. That is a positive sign. He has assured that he will do what he can to ensure that the court case is speeded up. Also, he has promised that employment will be provided very soon to youth from our community. But, our sit-in protest is going to continue. That has not been called off. We will hold a meeting on March 26 to decide the future course of action. And the UP Jats will stand by our Haryana brothers with all our strength. We had already mobilised more than 10,000 people for the agitation. We will involve more people now and our strength is only going to grow,” said  , UP state president of ABJASS.
