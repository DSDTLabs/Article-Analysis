CHANDIGARH: A good rainfall on Saturday raised the level of the   lake. From 1,161 feet before the downpour, the water reached 1,161.75 feet by 5pm on Saturday.

 The level is expected to rise further, as the weather department has predicted more   in the coming days. In the past six years, the city has received below-normal rainfall. This year,   had dropped below 1,151 feet. Last year, the highest level was 1,158 feet. The highest in 10 years was 1,163.95 feet in 2008.
 
 When created, the lake had storage capacity of 10.47 million cubic metres (mcm) and covered between 1.52 and 2.28 square kilometres. Between 1958 and 1962, the lake lost more than 20% of its capacity because of heavy silting. The drying up of manmade Sukhna has become a summer ritual. In 2009, the Punjab and   high court took first notice of the depletion and has since been monitoring the case.
