MANALI: Roads in   Pradesh with 682 black spots are turning fatal. At an average of 27 per day, majority of the accidents happen on Sunday, according to figures provided by 108 National Ambulance Service (NAS). 

 Out of the 682 accident prone black spots, 239 are vulnerable to repeated accidents. The 108 NAS, that received 8,67,763 emergency cases including 49,430 road accidents since 2011, had conducted a survey and discovered that most of the road accidents were reported on Sunday followed by Saturday and Monday with an average count of 25. The study points out excessive partying during weekends are behind these road rages. With 9,205 reported road accidents since 2011,   tops the list followed by   (6,823), Una (6,781) and Shimla (5,645). Lahaul-Spiti (214) and Kinnaur (281). The reason behind Kangra being extremely vulnerable to accidents is traffic congestion and density of population. Irresponsible driving is another factor that makes it an accident prone region despite the roads being in good condition. On the contrary, Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur witness lesser accidents because the places are sparsely populated. Though the roads are in pathetic shape, drivers exercise more caution behind the wheels on these roads. 
 
 The figures show that 40,091 men and 9,339 women have been victims of road accidents. In 2011, the total number was 5,963 and it climbed to 6,715 in 2012 and 6,650 in 2013. The year 2014 witnessed a sudden increase to 8,858 and it was 8,875 in 2015 and 9,542 in 2016. In 2017, the number is 2,811 till April 30.
 
 Mehul Sukumaran, state head of 108 NAS, being run by the government and   (EMRI), said, "We have saved 70,862 precious lives during emergencies in Himachal since 2011. Our responding time is just 9 minutes and 40 seconds in urban areas and 20 minutes and 35 seconds in rural areas. We request the people to call and wait for 108 ambulance in case of emergency instead of transporting victims in other vehicles which cannot provide pre-hospital care to patients." 
 
 EMRI experts suggest accidents in Himachal can be controlled by making the black spots safer. Mehul adds, "Warning signage and speed breakers can be set up at such spots. The condition of roads needs a make over especially the edges that need protection of railing and parapets. Avoiding drunken driving can avoid accidents."
