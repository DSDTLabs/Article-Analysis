LUDHIANA: Two miscreants beat to death a 55-year-old man in Daba on Friday afternoon over a monetary dispute. Son of the victim had borrowed Rs 1 lakh from the accused, which he claimed to have returned, but was still being harassed.

 It was alleged that the accused had earlier taken away a car and a cellphone from deceased Balbir Singh and his injured son  , residents of Satguru Nagar, Daba, saying some amount was outstanding.
 
 On Friday, the accused -- Raja and Sunny of the same locality -- went to Jagdeepâ€™s house in an SUV and started asking for money. When   said he had cleared the payment, they tried to snatch keys of his motorcycle. As he resisted, the two started thrashing him. Balbir came to his rescue, but the accused thrashed him, too, and pushed him to a wall. He suffered head injuries.
 
 On hearing their cries, neighbours reached the spot. A friend of Jagdeep, Harpreet Singh, stopped the accused from fleeing. Harpreet said the accused then agreed to take Balbir to hospital in their SUV, but dropped him outside a private hospital and fled. Doctors declared Balbir brought dead.
 
 Jagdeep had borrowed Rs 1 lakh from Sunny a few months ago to invest in his furniture business.   said Jagdeep had already repaid the debt, but Sunny was harassing him.
 
 The police have registered a case under charges of murder and thrashing against Raja and Sunny.
 
 The SHO said a manhunt has been launched to arrest the two.
