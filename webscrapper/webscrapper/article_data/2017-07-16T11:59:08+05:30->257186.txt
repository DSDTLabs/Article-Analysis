THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Forest minister K   ruled out any new encroachment of forest land in   forest range.

 The minister said here on Saturday that the government was closely monitoring the reports regarding forest land encroachment at   area in Thenmala forest range. “The government would not ignore any sort of encroachment into forest land. But as of now, there is no fresh instance of encroachments in the area,“ he said.
 
 “Six cases were pending in connection with encroachment of forest land in the area. There were people who had been living in the forest area prior to 111977 and others who encroached upon the land thereafter. As per the   rules and the orders of Union government, land can be assigned to those who had been occupying the same prior to 1977. This can be done after carrying out a joint inspection by revenue-forest departments. However, since the land at Urukunnu was on the banks of a river, the same was not included in the joint inspection. Some of these cases were compounded after levying fine as per the Forest Rights Act. Some other cases are pending. The government would soon take steps to carry out joint inspections at the earliest and find a final solution,“ Raju said.
