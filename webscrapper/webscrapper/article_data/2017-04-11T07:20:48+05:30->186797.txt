HYDERABAD: Road transport authorities are planning to shoot notices to motorists who pay for   (HSRPs) but do not return to get them fitted.

 Every month, an estimated 10% vehicles owners never come back to get the plates fixed, say authorities. Among new vehicles since the roll out of mandatory   in 2014, about 20% do not have HSRPs, admit  .
 
 Owners, say insiders, might be going for the easily available fake ones for just `400`500 for two-wheelers and `1,200 for four-wheelers.`1,000-` The primary aim of the pro ject was to have uniform numbers that could be easily read along with high security features, including special code embossed on the rear and front plates as well as on the sides.The idea was to automatically identify and trace vehicles in volved in any crimes or traffic violations, through the HSRPs.
 
 “We are looking at ways to send an SMS alert once the plates are ready and send notices to offenders. The option of sending   stickers to owners is also being studied. The only way to ensure that HSRPs do not become a cosmetic adornment is by enforcement,“ said J Pandurang Naik, joint transport commissioner, Hyderabad. “We need to catch people intentionally not fixing number plates, even as these are being made available,“ he said.
 
 Improper following up of the project has prevented the next leg of the intelligent traffic management system from being implemented. “Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras require a standard format of numbers but in the absence of the proper implementation of the HSRP project, we are now trying to procure ANPR cameras which can read other fonts too,“ said AV Ranganath, DCP traffic, Hyderabad.
