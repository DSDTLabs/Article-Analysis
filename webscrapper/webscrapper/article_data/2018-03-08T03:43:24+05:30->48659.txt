MUMBAI: Around 15 parents of   across the state staged a protest outside   on Wednesday to oppose an alleged   imposed by the management. They were detained by   since they did not have permission to protest. The parents alleged they were dragged by police into the van, injuring one of them.

 Gunjan Mehta, a Pune resident, was rushed to GT Hospital, alleged another protesting parent. A doctor at GT Hospital, however, said there were no visible injuries on Mehta.
 
 Manoj Kumar Sharma, zonal DCP, said no protestor was beaten. “The women had come to the assembly over school fee issue. We asked them to go to Azad Maidan. Later we took them to Marine Drive police station,” he said. Azad Maidan is a designated area for protest, so those protesting elsewhere are detained.
 
 Leader of the opposition in the assembly   said it is unfortunate that when Women's Day was being celebrated in Mantralaya, protesting parents, mostly women, were beaten up by police. "All they wanted is to speak to the education minister," he said demanding action against the cops.
 
 Junior minister of home Ranjeet Patil, however, said the parents were not beaten up and the woman who is in hospital felt dizzy in the police station. Seven women and four men were detained for protesting. "The report received from the hospital shows no evidence of any injury," said Patil. tnn
