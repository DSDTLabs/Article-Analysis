BHOPAL: Most of around 3,000 inmates and   staffers were eagerly waiting to catch a glimpse of film stars   and  , on Wednesday. But after waiting for a couple of hours, they were disheartened to learn that two Bollywood celebs did not come. 

 As per schedule, Anushka and Ranbir were to go there for shooting a biopic on Sanjay Dutt, but were in for disappointment when they came to know only few actors, dressed as inmates, were present.
 
 The film crew reached Central Jail in afternoon and shot several scenes till 2.45 pm, said sources. 
 
 Majority of staffers and inmates were excited about the presence of Anushka Sharma and Ranbir Kapoor. But their hopes were dashed, sources said. 
 
 Only around 8 actors, who were dressed like inmates, shot few scenes in the kitchen of the central jail before leaving,sources said. 
 
 The film crew is in the City of Lakes till March 12 to shoot most of the scenes in abandoned ‘old jail’. It was only for March 8, the state government had given Rajkumar Hirani permission to film on the central jail premises where convicts are imprisoned. As per schedule actors Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma were to come to the jail for shooting, sources said. 
 
 TOI had recently reported Ranbir is going an extra mile for the biopic. He has copied Dutt’s unique strut for the film by watching almost 200 hours of footage, transformed himself physically and is even sporting a wig to resemble the actor’s iconic mane in 90s.
 
 Actor   will play Sanjay Dutt’s mother Nargis in the film. In a recent interview, the director said since Manisha is a cancer survivor and had lived through the trying times and she would be able to identify with Nargis’ fight. The actress was also treated at the same cancer facility in New York, where Nargis had undergone treatment.
 
 Bhopal Central Jail houses around 3,500 inmates, including some ‘highly dangerous’ SIMI activists.
