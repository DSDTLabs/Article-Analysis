Kannada hudugi   loves her traditions and   tops the list of her favourite festivals for many reasons. “When one mentions Ugadi, I am excited because of a lot of things. First, it heralds the mango season, my favourite fruit. Next, it is a time for the entire family to come together under one roof,” she says. The first day is a potluck lunch gathering with each house’s signature dishes. These range from special Obbattus to   to Vangi Bath. Then continues to a sleepover with cousins. The next day, we feast on non-vegetarian specialities, play cricket and card games, like how Ugadi is celebrated on the second day. This year, since the weekend is so close by, we plan on extending the celebrations till the weekend,” says Sonu.
About the Ugadi day itself,   says that she loves the fact that the New Year is welcomed in the most balanced way in  . “Everyone eats the mixtures of jaggery, raw mango and neem leaves. These signify both the bitter and sweet things that the year will give us and indicates that we should have a balanced approach at accepting all that comes our way,” she signs off.
