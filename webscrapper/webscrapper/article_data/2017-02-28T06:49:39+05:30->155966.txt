GANDHINAGAR: After the Gujarat government was arm-twisted by the real estate lobby ahead of the 8th Vibrant summit in January — which threatened to boycott the summit chaired by PM   over   by government agencies in giving land and construction-related clearances — the state government has decided to move consideration and approval of all such clearances online.

 The state urban development department (UDD) was also given a target under PM Modi’s Ease of Doing Business programme, to smoothen the cumbersome processes affecting the real estate industry. Building construction clearances are considered a grey area prone to corruption, which leads to haphazard development of cities and burdens the exchequer.
 
 The government has started developing a comprehensive development permission system with (1) An automated building permission system (2) Geographic information system (GIS) based master plan for urban local bodies (3) Town planning data on GIS for municipal corporations (4) Integration for these services as a part of E-Nagar Extention (5) Internet services for all urban local bodies. The recent state budget allocated Rs 35 crore for this.
 
 Deputy chief minister and urban development minister   said: “The government has decided to deploy advanced technology in urban development. GIS-based urban development planning and GIS-based online approvals and clearance will start soon. We expect to start taking construction-related permissions online and minimize human intervention. All clearances will be have to be decided on in a stipulated time frame, which will not only help developers get clearances quickly but will bring transparency.”
