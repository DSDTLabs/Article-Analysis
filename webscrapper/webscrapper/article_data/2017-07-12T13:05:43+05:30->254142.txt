PATIALA: Arrest of a   of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT),  , by the   has put Patiala cops on their toes after it came to light that he had stayed in the district. An official letter sent by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) had alerted the Patiala police today morning.

 IB asked the cops to dig out details about Sandeep’s stay in Patiala. It also suggested that information about all those who have had any association with Sandeep be gathered and cross-checked.
 
 Confirming the development, Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) S Bhupati said the concerned station house officer (SHO) was working on the case and trying to ascertain credentials of the militant operative. He said so far it was not known if Sandeep had been involved in any crime in Patiala.
 
 “We are trying to extract more information about him,” the SSP said. Sandeep (26), who hails from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, shifted his base to Patiala in 2011 and had started working as a welder. It is claimed that he came in contact with a group of Kashmiri boys, who arrive in Patiala every October and work as waiters till April before returning to their native places.
 
 Kashmir police have put on record that Sandeep accompanied one Shahid Ahmed of Kulgam to the Valley and worked as a welder during summers. The two got into criminal activities and robbed ATMs and banks. Later, they came in contact with LeT terrorist Shakoor Ahmed from Sopore in north Kashmir. Shakoor, in turn, introduced them to LeT commander Bashir Lashkari. Lashkari had been gunned down in an encounter in Anantnag on July 1. Sandeep was arrested from the same house where the encounter had taken place. Sandeep's aide, Muneeb Shah from Kulgam was also arrested. 
 
 SSP Bhupati said after collecting relevant information about Sandeep, they would be sharing it with the IB and other security agencies that are engaged in counter terrorist activities in the Valley.
