VARANASI: Prime Minister Narendra performed puja at famous Durga Temple in Durgakund area here on Friday evening. He also went to   in the neighbourhood to release a set of postal stamps on Ramayana. In his brief address at Tulsi Manas Madir, he said that it is for the first time that such a set of postal stamps highlighting different aspects of Bhagwan Ram's life is being released. “The life of Bhagwan Ram has been source of inspiration for people and Mahatma Gandhi had taken it as a mantra in his life,“ the PM said. The Manas Temple is the best pla ce for releasing this stamp, he added.

 “I could have released this at Vigyan Bhawan or PM's residence in Delhi. But a thought came to my mind that no other place is better than Tulsi Manas Mandir for releasing   during Navratra. Navratra and Vijaya Dashmi holds special place in Bhagwan Ram's life,“ he said. The postal stamps depict the history of a nation and also exhibit the changes in the country.The postal department has been contributing to it, he said. The PM performed aarti and paid obeisance to Goddess Durga. He was accompanied by chief minister   and Governor Ram Naik.
 
 It was PM's first visit to both the temples. He had offered prayers at Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Kal Bhairo temple in his earlier visits. Modi had also visited Sankat Mochan Temple before the 2014 parliamentary elections.
