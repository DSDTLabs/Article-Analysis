PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa has issued notices to the two accused in the case of the death of British teenager  , after the   (CBI) filed for condonation of delay in challenging the acquittal order. Keeling was found dead on Anjuna beach in February 2008. The children’s court acquitted both, Samson D’Souza and  , On September 23 last year.

 “As there was delay of around 40 days in challenging the children court’s order, we have filed an application for condonation of delay, and notices have been issued to the accused,” a CBI officer said.
 
 Charges were framed against D’Souza and Carvalho in March 2010 and the CBI filed chargesheets against the duo under Indian Penal Code (IPC) Sections 304 (II) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 354 (assault or use of criminal force on a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 328 (administrating stupefying drug with an intent to cause hurt).
 
 After the Goa police faced a barrage of criticism for its failure to properly investigate the case, the government had handed it over to the CBI. 
 
 On September 30, 2016, Keeling’s mother, Fiona MacKeown, had petitioned Prime Minister  , seeking his intervention to ensure that the people responsible for her daughter’s death were identified and prosecuted, including those “who destroyed the evidence related to the crime” and those who “shielded the criminals by providing them ample time to destroy the evidence related to the crime”.
