HYDERABAD: Former minister and former   president   on Monday called K   an "accidental chief minister" who is now working "covertly" for the BJP and Narendra Modi. 

 "KCR became CM in unexpected circumstances. Unlike the people of Telangana who trusted him and gave their votes, leaders of various political parties in the country are not trusting him. JMM leader Hemant Soren, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, West Bengal CM   and DMK working president MK Stalin have directly or indirectly said no to KCR for another political front without the inclusion of the Congress at the national level," Lakshmaiah told reporters in New Delhi. He said the real intention of the proposed Federal Front is to divide the anti-Modi vote bank so that Congress loses at the national level.
 
 Meanwhile, TPCC chief spokesperson   said CM KCR and several TRS leaders were suffering from schizophrenia. Referring to KCR's speech during TRS plenary, Sravan said if KCR was not suffering from schizophrenia, he would not have challenged Congress leaders for a debate on 2BHK houses.
 
 TRS government has failed to fulfil its promises. "Have all eligible homeless poor families been given the 2bhk houses? How many Dalit families got three acres of land? Is the 12% reservation for Muslims and STs being implemented?" he asked.
 
 Referring to energy minister Jagadish Reddy's statement that TPCC chief  , while serving as IAF pilot, did nothing except take a salary, Sravan said, "Jagadish Reddy, in his attempt to project Uttam in a poor light, crossed all limits by criticising all soldiers."
