BENGALURU: With all   reaching  , the   has ruled out   this summer.

 Water resources minister M B Patil told reporters on Monday that they would urge farmers to cooperate and not use their pump sets to draw water from canals and reservoirs for agricultural activities. “The water which is available in reservoirs will suffice for exactly 60 days for the entire state," he added.
 
 While the main agricultural season is over, water will not be released for growing a second crop, or for sowing. “In parts of north Karnataka, after heavy rainfall in 2016, we supplied water from Narayanpura and Almatti dams for two crops. If there is a demand for more water in those areas, then it amounts to being greedy,'' Patil said. With regard to inter-state drawing of water, Patil said the government is urging Maharashtra to re lease 2tmcft of water to the Krishna basin, without any pre-conditions. “There was a demand from Maharashtra last year that the state must supply an additional 1.2tmcft of water to Solapur through canals from the Krishna river. We will be informing Maharashtra that the state will supply this water in May, and ask them to release 2tmcft immediately,“ said the minister. Patil said chief minister Siddaramaiah will also be speaking to his counterpart Devendra Fadnavis in this regard. He said a team of the water resources department will be talking to Maharashtra government officials for the same purpose.
 
 The government also got approval from Andhra Pradesh to get 0.5tmcft of water for the Krishna basin.
