DEHRADUN: In some good news for cancer patients in the state, the   (GDMC) will start an oncology unit for better treatment of the disease. The hospital will also hire experts to provide chemotherapy.
 
  Dr  , medical superintendent of the hospital, said, “To start with, we have hired an oncology surgeon and soon experts will be hired for the chemotherapy unit. We will try to provide better facilities for treatment of cancer patients as the disease has become a threat to the hill state due to excess tobacco consumption in the hills.”
  
  Tamta said that the oncologist would not only perform regular outpatient duty but will also be involved in gathering data related to cancer patients. TOI had earlier reported that the health department has not yet asked private hospitals to notify it as and when cancer cases are identified.
  
  With the start of the oncology unit, GDMC will become the first government hospital in the state to provide tumour surgery and chemotherapy.

  Cancer patients and their kin have welcomed the move to start the oncology unit in the hospital. “This is heart warming news. Cancer cases are on the rise and the health department needs to have a strategy to fight the disease,” said  , a teacher from   whose husband is suffering from cancer and is currently undergoing treatment in Chandigarh.
