 “Neither will we allow the government too loot the industry nor would we allow this government to thrash the farmers and laborers in the name of law and order situation,” said the ex-CM while addressing a gathering of farmers, laborers and industrialists at ‘Kisan Majdoor Mahapanchyat’ in the Yamunangar grain market on Sunday.
 
 Hooda accused the government of sitting on the implementation of Swaminathan report recommendations. Besides forcing the farmers, especially the poplar growers into the bankruptcy, the government and its ministers have disturbed the ecological balance of the area by encouraging illegal mining, he said, adding that the excessive mining was affecting the fertility of land.
 
 “If the Congress government of Punjab can do then what stops CM Haryana in following the suit. It is unfortunate that the Congress governments are waiving the loans while the Haryana government is facilitating the companies involved in crop insurance,” said Hooda.

He flayed the BJP government over “its failure in protecting the interests of Dalits in Haryana”. “Dalits are subjected to atrocities and no action is being taken against the culprits,” he said.
