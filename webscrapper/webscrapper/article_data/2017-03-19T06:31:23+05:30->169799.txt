CHANDIGARH: In his first cabinet meeting,   chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Saturday approved 33% reservation for women in all state jobs, including contractual and permanent appointments. With this move, Punjab has also joined Bihar which too has 35% of reservation for women.

 The government also separately announced that reservation for women in jobs would also be increased to 50% in panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies. Amarinder has already inducted two out of his three women MLAs in his first eight-member council of ministers.
 
 He also disclosed that free power will continue to farmers to ensure heavy debt doesnâ€™t lead to suicides. The cabinet decided to provide one house to every freedom fighter at the village or town, besides allocation of 300 units of free electricity every month.
 
 Finance minister   disclosed that Amarinder would soon meet the Prime Minister   over ways to waive off farmer debt as well as solve the SYL canal legal dispute. The government also said that no toll tax would be paid by freedom-fighters and journalists in Punjab.
