MOTIHARI/PATNA: Hours after a Delhi-bound bus fell into a roadside ditch on National Highway-28 and caught fire near   in Bihar’s   district on Thursday afternoon, the administration denied reports of massive casualties in the accident.

 “The ill-fated bus has been pulled out. It has been gutted, but we found no skeletons inside it,” Muzaffarpur police zone IG   told this newspaper over the phone.
 
 “We will send the ashes to the forensic science laboratory, and wait for its report to know if anyone died in the accident,” IG Sunil Kumar said late in the evening.
 
 The accident took place 30km away from East Champaran district HQ town Motihari and 120km from   when the bus driver attempted to save a two-wheeler around 3pm. The NH-28 connects UP’s Lucknow to Bihar’s Muzaffarpur from where the bus had originated. The ill-fated bus with a capacity to seat 70 passengers was being operated by Sahil Raj Bus Service.
 
 Unconfirmed reports earlier said there were more than 30 passengers inside the bus. “Now that it has been pulled out of the ditch, the bus is in front of you. You and I can see there is not even a single charred body inside it,” East Champaran DM Raman Kumar told newsmen at the spot.
 
 Kotwa circle officer Sanjay Kumar Rajnish said eight rescued passengers were admitted to the sadar hospital for treatment. “They are giving different statements on the number of passengers inside the bus at the time of the accident,” Rajnish said.
 
 Earlier amid reports of several deaths in the accident, governor Satya Pal Malik and CM Nitish Kumar had expressed grief over the tragedy. The CM had even observed a one-minute silence for the departed souls in the middle of an official event in Patna.
