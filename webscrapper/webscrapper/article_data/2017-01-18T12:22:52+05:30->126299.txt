ROORKEE: The   has taken a chance in   by giving six of the   in the   to be  .
 
  Though the party did not give a ticket to its one of its sitting MLAs, it accommodated two Congress rebel MLAs. Most of them who have been denied a ticket had made preparations for contesting the polls in their respective constituencies, but were sidelined. They are reportedly unhappy with the list of candidates.
  
  The BJP’s move has left all those candidates, who had contested the last assembly polls in 2012, in lurch, but the party defended the decision, saying it was solely based on a survey conducted by the party for candidates’ selection. “Allocation of tickets in Haridwar district has been done after a secrete survey conducted by the party,” said Sanjay Kumar, BJP state general secretary.
  
  Among the new faces are Jai Bhagwan Saini, a low-profile local leader, has been given the Piran Kaliyar seat instead of Shyambeer Singh Saini, who had lost the previous election from there. The Roorkee seat went to Pradeep Batra, instead of Suresh Chand Jain, who was defeated by Batra with a slender margin of 801 votes. “My claim for a party ticket was genuine. But, the party has allocated ticket to him (Batra), who had damaged the BJP in the previous elections. I am very unhappy with the party’s style, which doesn’t have respect for loyal workers,” said Jain.
  
  Similarly, Subodh Rakesh, Rishipal Baliyaan, Deshraj Karanwal and Kunwar Pranav Singh Champion are among new contestants from Bhagwanpur (SC), Manglaur, Jhabreda (SC) and Khanpur constituencies, respectively. Champion like Batra had contested on the Congress ticket from Khanpur seat in the previous elections.
  
  Interestingly, party did not give a chance to its own sitting MLA Chandra Shekhar Battewale from Jwalapur (SC) seat. He was replaced by one Suresh Rathore, who had contested the last time on party’s symbol from Bhagwanpur (SC) seat.
