GHAZIABAD: The   of a BJP   has been arrested for allegedly leasing out a house from where an   betting syndicate would operate.

 
 Tisu Tyagi (46), the husband of Ruby Tyagi, the   of ward 31 of Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation, was picked up along with nine others during a raid on the house in Nandgram on Sunday. Police sources said an undercover team had recovered from the house a revolver, a laptop, seven mobile phones and Rs 1.6 lakh in cash.
 
 “As of now, the primary involvement of the councillor’s husband seems to be his role in renting out the house where the betting syndicate operated. We are checking his links and trying to find out if he had ties with any of the other councillors,” said Akash Tomar, SP (city) Ghaziabad.
 
 The councillor did not respond to repeated calls and text messages from TOI.
 
 Police said they had raided the house following a tip-off that a betting syndicate was operating there. The arrested men are believed to have confirmed their role in betting during matches following sustained questioning through the night.
 
 A series of three FIRs has been registered against the accused under relevant sections of the Information Technology Act, 2008, IPC section 420 (fraud) and provisions of the Arms Act. Five of the accused — Ankit, Anuj, Rajdeep, Rahul, Dharmendra — had apparently obtained SIM cards on the basis of fake documents. The remaining five have been named as Sanjay, Vivek, Tisu, Vipin and Ravi. Police said Anuj was an MBA and worked as a sales executive in a watch store.
 
 “We have information about IPL betting syndicates operating in other parts of the city. We are trying to ascertain the veracity of this information,” said Tomar.
