MUMBAI: CM   said in Davos that there was no threat to the state government. "Let them (Sena) say what they feel like saying. I will not comment on that. But I can say with a measure of certainty that my government will finish its five-year term," he said. Fadnavis is in Davos to attend the World Economic Forum. 

  spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said there was nothing new in Uddhav's speech. "The Sena has been spewing venom on the BJP. The BJP is certainly not alarmed by what Uddhav Thackeray has said. This is not new to us," he said.
