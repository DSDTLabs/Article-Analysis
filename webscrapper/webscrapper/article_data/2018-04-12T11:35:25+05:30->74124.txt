PANAJI: Days after the   ( ) ordered the canteen at the   to suspend activities following an inspection which revealed unhygienic conditions in the kitchen, the institute has swung into action to remedy the faults. However, owing to the suspension of the activities the canteen management is throwing away nearly 50kg fresh vegetables.

 “Fixing up the place up to FDA standards may take a week or so. Until then, there is no food being prepared by us so the vegetables will likely get spoiled. We don’t have refrigeration for such a huge quantity and are forced to throw them away,” said one of the management staff on condition of anonymity.
 
 The canteen management is currently watching over the repair works which have been under way since Tuesday and visitors are being turned away. 
 
 “I usually come here for refreshments while my daughter finishes her dance class. I wasn’t aware that the canteen was not supplying food. I now have to wait until she gets done so both of us can eat a snack somewhere else,” said a parent.
 
 One of the organisers of an event at the premises who usually orders refreshments for attenddes from the canteen was left red-faced on learning that there wouldn’t be any tea for her guests. 
 
 Perspiring from the summer heat, many visitors who came seeking a bottle of water were also turned away from the canteen. “We can’t even sell water until we have everything in place,” a staff member said.
 
 Kala Academy chairman   had said on Tuesday that the institute won’t cancel the contract of the person operating the canteen as there have been no complaints over the food quality. TOI had reported the same on Wednesday.
 
 The FDA’s inspection on Monday revealed dirty kitchen flooring, a non-functional exhaust fan and a greasy gas stove and working platform. Loose wiring and broken switches in the kitchen were soiled, and utensils were broken. Water leakage was also observed during the inspection.
