 Sonu Sood, who is distributing the film in India under his banner,  , in association with Lawrence Paul, says, “Jackie Chan is hugely popular in India and he loved the warmth and affection he received during his recent visit to Mumbai. He’s excited about the film’s release here. While it feels great to be a part of this Indo-Chinese collaboration, I also feel proud to present 'Kung Fu Yoga' in India and we’ve pulled all stops to make it Jackie’s biggest release here.” 
 'Kung Fu Yoga' releases February 3. 
 
 
 “Making 'Kung Fu Yoga' was challenging because justice had to be done to India and China’s history and culture that date back to thousands of years. Our cultures have a lot in common. What makes this film interesting is that it’s akin to a big event, offering cinegoers a visual treat enjoyable at several levels.”
