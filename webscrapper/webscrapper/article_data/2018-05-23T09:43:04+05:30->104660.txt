GUWAHATI: Kaziranga-based environment activist   has filed an FIR with police on having to face "tremendous pressure" from a section of people who are opposed to the ban on mining in Karbi Anglong hills on the southern fringe of   National Park. Following a complaint lodged by Choudhury with the ministry of environment, forest and climate change against rampant stone extraction and quarrying activities in Karbi Anglong last year, the ministry had directed the state government on April 20 to take "immediate action" to stop mining in these areas. 

 In the FIR lodged at the   police station in   district on Sunday, Choudhury stated, "I have come to know from various sources that rich and powerful persons involved in illegal mining around Kaziranga may try to cause physically harm me and my family members."
 
 "A sense of fear is being created in the area by powerful vested interests involved in illegal mining to pressurize me to withdraw my ongoing cases pending before the Central Empowered Committee of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India and Hon'ble National Green Tribunal, New Delhi, which are related to the conservation & protection of Kaziranga National Park & Tiger Reserve," Choudhury said in the FIR.
 
 "I am not going to budge because of pressure, because if we don't stop mining and stone quarrying in Karbi Anglong, Kaziranga will be destroyed forever. All of us in   take so much pride in Kaziranga. It is also our duty to save this biodiversity landscape from being destroyed," Choudhury told TOI.
