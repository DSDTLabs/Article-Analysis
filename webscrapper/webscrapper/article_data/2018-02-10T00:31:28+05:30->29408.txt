THANE: With   just around the corner, youngsters in Thane are busy browsing online portals, youtube tutorials and mobile applications to craft the perfect gift for their loved ones. Forgetting the clichéd chocolate hampers, soft toys and a bouquet of red roses, these young couples are brainstorming beyond the commonly sought-after presents, coming up with innovative ideas to express their love.

 From composing a poem, organizing a scrapbook filled with pictures, letters and illustrations to creating a video montage, the gen X it seems is following the ‘Do-it-yourself’ trend this Valentine season. Prajakta Chitnis (21), a resident of Majiwada, said “For the past three years, I have been personally making the valentine gifts, as I believe there is a sense of personal attachment associated with it. First, I think about all that he wants to achieve in his life. Then based on whatever goals he wants to accomplish in the near future, I draw multiple illustrations of him gearing up to achieve those goals. On a tiny card I also write a few words of encouragement just to give him the final push he requires and add in a quote too.”
 
 While some might opt for the store-bought gift at the very last minute, others are going out of their way to plan their gifts in advance. 
 
 Similarly, 22-year-old Shraddha Vedak, a resident of Vartak Nagar said, “Last year, I had decided to bake cupcakes as well as chocolates. I had also written a couple of letters and stuck pictures of the two of us. In a decorative box, I had kept all the items together. This year, too, I am planning something special.” — Aavni Ghangurde
