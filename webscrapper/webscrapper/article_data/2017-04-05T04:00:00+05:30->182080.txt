Ahmedabad: The Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM), an outfit affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayam Sevak Sangh (RSS), courted controversy on Tuesday when it opened its headquarters in the city.

 The signboard put up on MRM headquarters on the Relief Road depicts India’s map on the top left corner without a large section of Jammu & Kashmir. The northern part of J&K is not shown in the map. This is the area which is beyond the Line of Control.
 
 When TOI called the office-bearers whose mobile numbers are prominently displayed on the signboard, they did not respond to the query about the wrong depiction of the country’s map about which rightwing organizations are normally very sensitive. 
 
 The signboard contains pictures of RSS leaders like Indresh Kumar and local Muslim leaders who are connected with the BJP. Former IPS officer and chairman of Gujarat Wakf Board, A I Saiyed, is one of them. 
 
 When contacted, Saiyed expressed ignorance about the matter. “I don’t know where the office has been inaugurated. I will have to inquire about this,” Saiyed said.
 
 Zahir Qureshi, who looks after the outfit in Gujarat and has been assigned the task of cow protection, also said that he had no idea about who runs this headquarters in Ahmedabad. 
 
 “The headquarters was recently started but I don’t know who manages it. The signboard wasn’t put up on the instructions of the Manch,” Qureshi told TOI.
 
 The NDA government has proposed a law — the Geospatial Information Regulation Bill 2016 — in which wrong depiction of the map of India can land violators in jail for a maximum of seven years. They can also be fined up to Rs100 crore.
