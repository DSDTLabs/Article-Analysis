MANGALURU: The first PU examination results will be announced across   district from 8am onwards on March 19. This time there is a change - instead of manual method, the results will be made available online so that students may access them at the comfort of their homes.

  is a result of the initiative taken by the Dakshina Kannada Pre University College Principal’s Association. They have introduced a software called ‘SUvidya’ – an online result-processing system for all 199 PUC Colleges in the district.
 
 Giving details about the same,  , deputy director, pre-university education (DDPU) on Saturday, said this is one experiment among many done by association. The new exam result announcement aims to increase clarity and transparency in results through a centralised system. “This system was appreciated by higher officials of DPUE and they want to implement it across state. We believe that this system is more student friendly and cuts down confusion,” he told reporters.
 
 The software was designed by Aculogics, a Shivamogga-based company.
 
 Explaining about hurdles faced earlier, S M   principal K K Upadhya said, “All had to collate results in ‘A3’ size papers, which a normal printer cannot print. So after the results were collated, one had to go to cyber cafés to take printouts and there were chances of the café owners taking a soft copy of the results and give them it students before the date of the results. This destroyed the sacredness of examination.”
 
 “Online results will also put a break on results of some students being withheld citing non-payment of fee and other reasons. Once the result of a candidate is entered after all checks, it cannot be changed,” he added. According to officials, there is no room for any manipulation.
 
 This academic year, 38,306 students appeared for first PU examinations across DK.
