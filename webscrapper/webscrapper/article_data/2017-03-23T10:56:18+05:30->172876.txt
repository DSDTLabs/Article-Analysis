KOLLAM: Two days after launching a scathing attack on AICC vice-president  ,   (YC) state vice-president   resigned from his post besides relinquishing his party membership on Wednesday.

 Mahesh, in a Facebook post on Monday, had come down heavily on the AICC vice-president for his “inefficiency in leading the party.”
 
 The YC leader, the first Congress worker from the state to openly criticize Gandhi, told reporters here that he had sent his resignation letter to the organization’s national president.
 
 “I am also quitting the party,” the ‘I’ group leader said.
 
 Mahesh’s bitter post stirred a hornet’s nest, with several Congress leaders, including Ramesh Chennithala and P C Vishnunath, criticizing the YC leader. The state committee even suspended Mahesh, who had contested to the assembly from Karunagappally.
 
 He was the lone UDF candidate who gave a tough fight in the assembly polls in the district, where the LDF had made a clean sweep.
 
 In his Facebook post, Mahesh asked Gandhi to resign “if he has no interest in leading the party from the front. The Congress leadership, which is taking lightly the downfall of a great political party at both the national and state levels reminds me of Emperor Nero, who played fiddle while Rome burned. The leaders, who are supposed to be leading the war against anti-people policies of the government, are remaining perplexed,” he said.
 
 Mahesh also criticized senior leader   for his ‘silence’ when “those without any political intelligence were turning the Youth Congress and the KSU into laboratories for strengthening groupism.”
 
 “The KPCC is remaining without a head for the past two weeks. The party which has to lead the people’s agitation against the failure of the CPM and the BJP governments, is remaining silent without a leader.” he said.
