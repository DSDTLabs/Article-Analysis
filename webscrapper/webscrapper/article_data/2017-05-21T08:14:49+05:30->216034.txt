PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Trees are in a bad state at the   in Akurdi Pradhikaran due to lack of water.

 Considered to be the second-largest garden in the Pradhikaran area of Pimpri Chinchwad, Dnyaneshwar Udhyan is spread over nine acres of land. The absence of proper maintenance has resulted in plants drying up. Consequently, the soil has also cracked.
 
 Dry hibiscus and jackfruit trees are a common sight as one enters the garden. The caretaker claimed that the water pump operates only two to three days in a month due to which the plants cannot be watered in the heat.
 
 Several trees in the Gajanan Maharaj garden located near the Sindhunagar post office in   have also met a similar fate. The trees planted on the divider from Sambhaji Chowk to   in Akurdi have also died.
 
 Vijay Patil, president of the Pradhikaran Nagari Suraksha Samiti, said, “The water is brought through pipelines from Ganesh lake to the storage tanks in the gardens, which is further connected to a network of pipelines. The foot valves of the pumps are of inferior quality and break down frequently. So the trees and plants are not watered regularly. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation must resolve the problem at the earliest.”
 
 Samiti secretary Vijay Munot, said, “I come daily in the morning and evening for jogging. It’s sad that many trees and plants are dying without water. If the PCMC cannot operationalize the pumps then it must use water tankers to water the trees and plants.”
 
 Resident Archana Ghali hundreds of people from surrounding areas visit the garden daily and the facility has trees not commonly found elsewhere.
 
 Suresh Salunke, chief garden superintendent of the PCMC, claimed that civic electric department had been informed about the problem of motor pumps.
