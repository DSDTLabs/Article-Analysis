YAVATMAL: Contaminated water supply to scarcity-hit villages has started taking its toll as over 71 villagers from Watkhed in   tehsil were on Thursday admitted to   due to  .

 Hospital sources said that all the patients are out of danger. The village was being supplied water through tankers for the last several days. Sources claimed that water supplied through the tankers is not tested for any contamination.
 
 “The entire district is reeling under severe water scarcity and several villages are being supplied water through tankers. As the authorities do not test water for its safety, unscrupulous tanker operators fill and supply water from any source they find. This will make more villagers susceptible to waterborne diseases,” sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, MP of Washim-Yavatmal Bhavana Gawali visited Watkhed on Friday and took stock of the situation. She instructed health department officers to ensure villagers get proper medical care at the earliest. Gawali also visited the GMCH and met the patients.
