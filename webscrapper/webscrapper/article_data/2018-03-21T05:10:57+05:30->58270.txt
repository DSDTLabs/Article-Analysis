MUMBAI:   companies say that they might need to go to the regulator and seek higher premiums if inclusion of   increases their claims outgo. On Monday, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) directed insurers not to reject any health insurance claim based on exclusions related to ‘genetic disorder’. 

 The regulator also asked insurers not to list ‘genetic disorders’ as one of the exclusions in new health insurance policies. The circular is in line with a Delhi high court order that held that exclusionary clause of ‘genetic disorders’ in insurance policies as too broad, ambiguous and discriminatory, and in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution dealing with right to equality. 
 
 “If eventually the experience requires price correction, we will go to the regulator to seek a price revision,” said G Srinivasan, chairman, New India Assurance. He said that insurance companies, who do medical underwriting while accepting a policy, would need to look at all aspects to prevent losses to the industry.  , head of underwriting and claims,  , said, “Long term, there is always the possibility that you may reprice. 
 
 In the short term, it will prevent rejections of claims where the policyholder was not aware of an ailment that was not detected. Because insurers are not rejecting the claims, it will come back to their portfolio and require repricing.”
