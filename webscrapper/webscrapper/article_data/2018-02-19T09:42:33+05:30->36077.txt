THANE: The   ( ) has ordered a Rs 1.4 crore   to a 38-year-old  , who was maimed for life in a road mishap involving a container truck. The money will have to be paid jointly by the insurance company, New India, and UP-based truck owner,   Freight Carriers. This is perhaps a record compensation awarded for   in the recent past, according to the legal fraternity here.

 Kiran aka Kirron H Patil, a resident of Kaneri in Bhiwandi, had pleaded for compensation as the accident had rendered him completely disabled. The legal team representing Patil stated that when he was riding a bike from Thane towards Bhiwandi city, the container rammed his vehicle from the rear and its wheel seriously injured his leg, thigh and waist near Highway Diva petrol pump at 6.30pm on September 2, 2015.
 
 Patil told the tribunal that he had to spend Rs 40 lakh and undergo several surgeries, and was left with cent percent disability. He pointed out that he was a BE (civil), and was a liaison officer with a builder, with a salary of Rs 33,333 pm. The accident injuries rendered him a permanent disability, which affected his working capacity 100%, so he has been unable to work, and hence sought Rs 1.5 crore.
 
 A doctor who treated Patil deposed that there were serious injuries to his legs, and his left leg was amputated below the knee. The doctor added that due to serious urological and orthopaedic injuries too, the working capacity of Patil was totally affected, and he cannot stand, walk and travel independently. The accident had also led to a “loss of sexual capacity permanently”, so his marriage prospects were badly affected. 
 
 Judge K D Vadane, member of MACT, noted, “On perusing photographs, it reveals that the injuries are very serious, and he is unable to stand, walk or sit due to loss of power of both legs. Moreover, when Kiran Patil was brought here on a stretcher, by ambulance, he was unable to stand, walk or sit and give evidence. Therefore, a court commissioner was appointed for recording his evidence. All this show that due to loss of power of his legs, he is unable to stand, sit or walk, and his condition was very doleful, and affected his working capacity 100%.”
 
 The tribunal ordered the compensation which included Rs 25 lakh for OPD and other charges, and medicines, and Rs 73 lakh for future loss of income.
 
 As the container owner did not appear before the tribunal, the case was decided ex parte, and he and New India Assurance Co Ltd, have to make the payment along with 8% interest from the date of filing of the claim, in December 2015.
