 who was reportedly initially planning to helm the Sapna Didi biopic with   and Irrfan Khan in the lead will now be concentrating on another project, after his rumoured indifference with Vishal Bhardwaj. The reports further stated that he is planning to rope in   for his debut film as a director.

 
 For the uninitiated, Honey Trehan is Vishal Bhardwaj’s protégé and has assisted the filmmaker in numerous films like ‘Kaminey’, ‘Omkara’, ‘Maqbool’ and ‘7 Khoon Maaf’. Sources close to the development revealed that the film in question featuring Nawaz is a crime thriller. Reportedly set in the interiors of India, this untitled project is yet to find its leading lady.
 
 
 Sources also said that though Nawaz has liked the script, but is yet to give a final nod and sign on the dotted lines of the project. Expected to go on floors by early next year, Honey has reportedly began the pre-production work for the movie. The details of Nawaz’s character in the film is said to be kept under wraps. Nawazuddin, reportedly, may begin prep for the said film, right before its shooting.
 
 
 Nawazuddin is currently busy shooting for his upcoming film ‘Thackeray’ where he portrays the character of the iconic political leader Balasaheb Thackeray. It is also being said that Nawazuddin will feature opposite   in the Ritesh Batra film ‘Photograph’.
