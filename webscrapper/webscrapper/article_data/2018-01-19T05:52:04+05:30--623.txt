TRICHY: Five days after demonetised currency notes valued at 1 crore was seized from four people here, the income tax (I-T) department is maintaining silence on the action taken in the issue.

 The seizure of 1,000 and 500 denomination notes for 77.5 lakh and 22.5 lakh respectively by the police from   of Erode, Vijayan of Paramathi Vellore in Namakkal, Veluchamy of Salem and Chinnathambi of Thiruchengodu in Namakkal district near   on the outskirts of Trichy on January 13 took everyone by surprise as such a huge volume was still available even 14 months after they became invalid. 
 
 It is learnt that I-T officials from Trichy had made inquiries with the four to find out their source of income. “The officials required the information about the source of income and whether the tax for the income was paid. 
 
 The four reportedly told the officials that it was their own money. The investigation is proceeding in that angle only. They did not take the possession of the seized currencies,” said a police officer. 
 
 In this case, police had taken possession of the currency notes only but had not registered a case as there was no complaint against the four. 
 
 A senior police official in Trichy on condition of anonymity said that the currency was of no value. The conversion period given to exchange the old notes for new currency had also lapsed. Hence, the possession of the invalid currency notes won’t be taken seriously either by the police or by the I-T department. 
 
 The four were caught when they were returning to Salem from Thuraiyur after a deal with   of   in Thuraiyur who promised to exchange the currencies for new ones failed. 
 
 When contacted, a senior official in the investigation wing of the I-T department refused to comment on the matter saying that he was not authorised to speak to the media.
