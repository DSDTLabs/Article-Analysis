NOIDA: Family members of a woman, who was allegedly burnt alive a week ago by her in-laws in   village in Dadri, protested at the SSP’s office in Surajpur against “police inaction” in the case on Tuesday morning.

 The almost fully burnt body of the woman, Nisha Bhati, who had been married to Kapil from Anandpur village since 2011, was found in her room, which was had smoke and prints of burnt hands on the walls, as seen in a video of the house. 
 
 Kapil works as a labour contractor in the village.
 
 According to the family, the police has failed to arrest any of the four accused. They met SSP Dharmendra Singh and the SP (Rural) Sujata Singh who promised arrests in the case.
 
 “On the morning of April 4, I got a call from a resident of Anandpur village who said my sister was dead. When I reached the village along with a few elders from our home in Dabra, I saw Nisha’s burnt body,” said Rahul Bhati, Nisha’s brother.
 
 Based on a complaint filed by the victim’s father Balraj Bhati, an FIR was lodged under sections 498A, 304B and 3 and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 against Kapil, his brother Mohit, father Jagpal and mother Mukesh used to beat Nisha and demand dowry from them.
 
 The victim’s family alleged that Kapil’s family had demanded a Scorpio from them, said the police.
 
 “We kept quiet for a long time as it was a family matter. They used to call us for the money,” Rahul said, adding that filing the FIR had been delayed for some time because the villagers pressurised them to reach a compromise.
 
 Ram Sen Singh, Jarcha SHO, told TOI the postmortem had been done. 
 
 “We met the SSP and SP (rural area) and sought arrest of the accused in the case as nothing has happened even after eight days of my sister’s death,” he said.
 
 Piyush Singh, circle officer, Dadri, who is investigating the matter, said the police will soon arrest the accused.
