 Initially, he sought treatment from neighbourhood doctors. However when his condition worsened, he was referred to Ruby Hall Clinic in Pune where he was admitted on December 31. He was given supportive respiratory care at the hospital after he developed severe breathlessness. When he didnâ€™t show any improvement, he was put on the ventilator.
 
 During treatment, the man suffered kidney failure and died of swine flu-induced viral pneumonia with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and kidney injury around 5.30am on Sunday.
 
 The man was diagnosed with diabetes six months ago and was on anti-diabetic medications, said a civic health official.
 
 Last year, swine flu had infected 29 patients and claimed 10 lives at different hospitals in the city. Among the dead, four were local residents while the rest were referred to hospitals here from adjoining areas.
