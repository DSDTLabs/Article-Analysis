After waiting for three days to meet Prime Minister  , the AIADMK members of Parliament led by   deputy speaker M Thambidurai on Saturday met President Pranab Mukherjee over the jallikattu row.

 The Union government on Friday cleared the   government's draft ordinance lifting the ban on jallikattu. The AIADMK members called on the President who returned to New Delhi after a foreign visit the same night.
 
 “We have sought time multiple times to speak to the Prime Minister on the issues surrounding Cauvery ,  , fishermen, Sri Lankan Tamils and Katchatheevu. While we have got opportunities on the earlier occasions, there has been no such instance in the last one year.We have not been able to meet the Prime Minister at all,“ the MP told reporters after meeting Mukherjee in New Delhi.
 
 Citing the ongoing agitation in Tamil Nadu to lift the ban on jallikattu, the AIADMK leader said there would be dangerous implications if the Centre continued to ignore the regional aspirations and interests of the people of Tamil Nadu. “They say one tax, one nation (Goods and Services Tax), but the concept of one language, one culture is not good for federalism,“ he said.“What you are seeing in Tamil Nadu is the result of the failure of the Centre,“ he said.
 
 The AIADMK leader said it was the responsibility of the Prime Minister to meet the elected representatives. “We are leaving with heavy hearts,“ Thambidurai said.
 
 Besides the President, the MPs had an audience with home minister   and presented him a memorandum seeking his intervention on the jallikattu ordinance.
 
 Thambidurai said the party was thankful to Modi and his cabinet colleagues for enabling Tamil Nadu to hold jallikattu this year. “I also request him to help us whenever we approach him on this issue,“ he added.
