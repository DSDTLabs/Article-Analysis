According to the note, ‘Based on past experience for the funding of Dilshad Garden-New Bus Stand metro line we saw that many agencies were unable to contribute their share either fully or wholly’. The slump in real estate sector and other reasons for were blamed for the delay in payment.
 
 The note also said that as   is a part of NCR, it would be befitting if the Centre bears a major portion of the cost.

The GDA, GMC, UP housing board and UPSIDC will pay 5%, 2%, 2% and 1% respectively. The GDA will have to pay Rs 202.4 crore, the GMC and housing board Rs 80.96 crore each and the UPSIDC Rs 40.48 crore.
