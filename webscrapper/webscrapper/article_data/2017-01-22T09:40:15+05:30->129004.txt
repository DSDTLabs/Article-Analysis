CHENNAI: Hosts   put in a valiant display, but the brilliance of   proved to be too good as   made it four wins out of four here on Saturday.

 The winger could have easily been the villain of the piece after his penalty miss in the first half, but he more than made up for it later on. In the 77th minute, Norde came up with a clinical finish to give his side a hardearned 2-1win after Jeje had collected the ball from midfield and played him in.
 
 Norde had played a critical role in Bagan's equaliser too. After CCFC had surprisingly taken the lead in the 52nd minute, Norde made a dazzling run down the left flank before finding striker Darryl Duffy with his cross. Duffy's shot was subsequently blocked by the Chennai defence, but Jeje volleyed in the rebound to make it 1-1.
