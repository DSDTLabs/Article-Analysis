  Besides Maiga, the group included Beausson-Diagne, Mata Gabin, Maimouna Gueye, Eye Haidara,  ,  , Marie-Philomene Nga, Sabine Pakora, Firmine Richard, Sonia Rolland, Magaajyia Silberfeld, Shirley Souagnon, Assa Sylla, Karidja Toure, and  .
 
  Maiga stressed the importance of using the Cannes platform to "change structures in society" and the French movie industry, calling for funding mechanisms that will promote diversity in film so "that we start to see the real France on the screen."
