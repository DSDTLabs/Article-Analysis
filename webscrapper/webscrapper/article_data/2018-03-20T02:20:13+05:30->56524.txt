NEW DELHI: From this summer, city students will be able to use their bus   to travel in air-conditioned   buses.

 Currently, students can get a concessional monthly bus pass for Rs100, which are only valid for non-air-conditioned DTC buses and those under the cluster scheme run by DIMTS. The general monthly bus passes issued by DTC, however, cost Rs800 for travelling in non-air-conditioned buses and Rs1,000 for air-conditioned buses.
 
 The government, however, has decided to allow students with concessional bus passes to travel in   too. The monthly student bus pass will be issued for Rs200. Students will be able to use this pass to travel in the 1,275 AC DTC buses.
 
 “We are working out financial implication and making necessary budgetary provisions,” Delhi’s transport minister Kailash Gahlot told TOI, while confirming that concessional passes would be allowed.
 
 According to sources, the proposal has already been cleared by the DTC board and is now awaiting government’s approval. The move is expected to benefit nearly five lakh students in the city.
