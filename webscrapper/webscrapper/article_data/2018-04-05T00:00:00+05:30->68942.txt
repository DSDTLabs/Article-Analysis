Model-actress   revealed to   that this was not the first time that her actor boyfriend   has physically assaulted her. 

 “Kiran had hit me when we were in the first year of our relationship (she says that they have been together for five years). I broke up with him after that. Then, after some months, Kiran got back in touch with me and we started seeing each other again. He would verbally abuse me, but he never physically assaulted me after that, till March 29. We got married in a temple in Manali several years ago. Kiran and I used to visit his parents in  , and I have spent over a week with them each time, sharing a room with Kiran. Our parents knew about our relationship. Every time I asked Kiran about making our wedding official, he would seek more time, saying that he was concentrating on his career. I understood and didn’t force him. But after five years of being together, I told him that he had to take a stand. Around three months ago, I started asking him constantly about our wedding and that resulted in the assault. After his arrest, I spoke to Kiran at the police station, but he did not apologise for what he did; he showed no remorse,” she says.
