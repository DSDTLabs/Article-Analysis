AHMEDABAD: The   (GU) authorities on Wednesday decided that   conducted by the varsity will be declared within 45 days of the exam. If an   fails to declare the result in the stipulated time, then actions will be initiated against the concerned officer, said GU officials.

 Himanshu Pandya, in-charge vice-chancellor of GU, said that they introduced various reforms in examination procedure to ensure speedy deceleration of results in the varsity-run colleges.
 
 Earlier, if a student applied for reassessment of his marks, then it was evaluated by two teachers and the marks will be increased if the difference was of 15% from the marks given by the first teacher. Now, the student will get all the marks if there has been any increase in those marks after the reassessment, said Pandya, adding that this will help in improving the results of students.
 
 Pandya also said that the question papers setter will not be made the   coordinators in the exam in order to avoid extra burden on them.
 
 Besides, if result of any subject comes below 50% then the issue will be taken before the exam reform committee, said Pandya.
 
 He said that a question bank comprising subjective and objective questions will be put in the GU website so that students can prepare for the exams with ease. The GU authorities have decided that marks of the top five students of the varsity will be evaluated by the examination reform committee to ensure no such irregularity will take place.
