MYSURU: Demanding that China come clean on the whereabouts of the  , members of the Tibetan Youth Congress and Regional Tibetan Women’s Association of Bylakuppe, Hunsur and Kollegal said that the Chinese authorities had abducted Gedhun Choekyi Nyima when he was just six years old, as he was declared the 11th Panchen Lama. 

 “It has been 23 years since his abduction but China has kept us all in the dark about his whereabouts,” they said.
 
 On the anniversary of the Lama’s abduction,   of the organization said, “The 11th Panchen Lama is the youngest political prisoner. May 17 being the anniversary of his abduction, we demand that China release him and show us proof that he is alive.”
 
 Stating that China has kept the whole world in the dark about the condition of the Lama, he said, “Today, the 11th Panchen Lama is 29 years old and has become the longest held prisoner for 23 years. Nobody knows about his wellbeing or if he has received any education. We do not believe China. We need to see some photographs or video evidence which indicates that the Panchen Lama is alive.”
 
 Accusing China of violating human rights, he said, “China should reveal details about the Lama and his family’s whereabouts. Though many human rights organizations have taken up the issue with China, nothing has come out of it as China has been non-cooperative and doesn’t utter a word about the issue.”
 
 Demanding the release of Tibetan language activist Tashi Wangchuk, he said, “Since 2016, Tashi   has been held as prisoner by China due to his attempts to popularize and propagate the Tibetan language.”
 
 China should accept the middle path approach mooted by the Dalai Lama to solve the Tibetan issue, suggested Dorjee.
