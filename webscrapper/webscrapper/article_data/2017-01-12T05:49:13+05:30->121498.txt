AJMER: A two-year-old girl was branded with hot iron rods in   in Bhilwara district, under the belief that it would cure her of respiratory problems. The child is in a critical condition at the hospital.

 Lodging an FIR against the atrocity , the girl's father Jamnalal Bairva told police, “My daughter had developed respiratory problems two days ago. Advised by fellow villagers, we took her to Bada Mahuva village, where a person guaranteed her cure.“ The man branded hot iron rods on the child's stomach, leaving her seriously injured. She was rushed to a hospital as her condition deteriorated, said police.
 
 Senior physician O P Aagal said, “Though there are primary health centres in villages, many take sick kids to self-proclaimed `healers'.“ He said in the last six months, three cases were reported in which kids were branded with hot iron as a `cure'.
