KOCHI: Residential localities in Irumbanam, Kandanad, Valiyakulam and Thiruvangulam will get water supply only once in nine days, the   ( ) officials have informed. 

 Despite heavy rainfall the suburban areas in the city, these localities have been reeling under severe water scarcity. Shortage of water at Ramamangalam river, lack of bunds in the water bodies and inadequate rain water harvesting techniques are the primary reasons which led to the water scarcity.
 
 People living in these areas will be at the receiving end in the coming days since the water authority officials have informed them that due to water shortage at Ramamangalam river, the Choondi water plant has not been able to supply adequate freshwater.
 
 Water is pumped from the Ramamangalam river to the KWA'S Choondi water plant and then to Karingachira pump house. 
 
 "As a result water would be supplied only once in nine days in Thiruvankulam, Chitranjali, Eruveli, Udayakavala, Ambadimala, Kurikaadu, Kandanadu, Valiyakulam," said  , assistant executive engineer, KWA.
 
 Moreover, the water supply would remain disrupted for few more days if sufficient water is not available at Choondi pump house or if there is power disruption. So at this juncture, we are requesting the resident of these areas to co-operate with us in this regard, he said.
 
 As part of the renovation work on Choondi water project, laying of pipes between Ramamangalam and Choondi water was planned last year. But due to some disputes between LSGD authorities regarding digging up of the then relayed road stretch between Ramamangalam and Choondi water plant, the pipes were laid only in certain areas, said KWA assistant executive engineer.
 
 "The KWA has been planning to replace a 30-year-old pipeline with a 900mm ductile iron pipe to carry more water along the 5.5km stretch,'' a KWA official said.
