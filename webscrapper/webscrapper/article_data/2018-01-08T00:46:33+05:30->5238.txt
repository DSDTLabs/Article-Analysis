Chennai: The K4   bagged the fifth place in the ministry of home affairs’ list of best police stations in the country, in the category of smart police stations. Two months ago, a committee visited the station for assessment and checked parameters such as rate of recovery of property and disposal of cases and other infrastructural facilities.

 The station, which was renovated two months ago at a cost of Rs 7 lakh, has an exclusive room for visitors, a waiting hall, investigation room, a receptionist cabin and drinking water.
 
 The team which inspected the station took the response of at least 100 people including the owners of commercial establishments and took note of how police interacted with them.
 
 The station even designated specific timings so the public could meet the inspectors after city police commissioner   made it mandatory for inspectors to be present at the station.
 
 “With a specific schedule in place, the public need not have to visit the station frequently and waste their time,” said   M Saravanan of Anna Nagar police station. “When it comes to emergency calls to the police control room, we always ensure that the response time is five minutes.”
 
 Police also formed WhatsApp groups with residents so they could air their grievances.
 
 “Now, our aim to bring the area under CCTV surveillance which is possible only with the cooperation of residents,” reiterates Saravanan.
