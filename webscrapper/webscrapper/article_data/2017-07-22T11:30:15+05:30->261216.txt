LUCKNOW: Cabinet   for excise   has lodged a complaint with the state government about the poor power scenario in his home district  . 

 In his complaint dated July 19 addressed to energy minister Srikant Sharma, Singh said both rural and urban areas were reeling under prolonged electricity outages. 
 
 “There is gross resentment among people in the district,”’ he said in the complaint, requesting scheduled   in Siddharthnagar.
 
 Singh’s letter describing the situation in his home town is in sharp contrast to UP government’s claims of providing adequate power to all districts. 
 
 The state government has been facing flak from a belligerent Opposition questioning the veracity of the claim that it is providing 18 hours of power supply to rural and 24 hours to urban areas.
 
 The issue of poor power supply has been coming up in UP Assembly as well as in the council. Led by the Samajwadi Party, the Opposition has been taking on the BJP government vis-a-vis power supply. 
 
 UP has been facing a power shortage after some central hydro-electric plants stopped functioning because of silt. According to UPPCL officials, the state is facing a shortage of around 2,000 MW. The situation in Siddharthnagar was only compounded by ongoing work on an under-constructed sub-station and transmission lines.
