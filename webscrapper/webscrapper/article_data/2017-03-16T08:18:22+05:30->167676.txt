LUCKNOW: With the change of government in UP, the future of the much-hyped   launched by   to check rampant impersonation and copying in examinations lies in the lurch. 

 Education officials in Lucknow have no information on the use of the app launched by   (UPMSP) in the   beginning on Thursday. 
 
 As many as 1.02 lakh class X and XII students will appear in the examination at 149 centres in the state capital. Of this, 57,907 studetnsare registered in class X and 44,754 in class XII. The board has identified 11 centres as highly sensitive and 28 as sensitive. Copying at these centres has been rampant in the past. 
 
 In a set of instructions issued by the district inspector of schools (DIOS) on the eve of the examinations, there is no mention of the attendance app used on smartphones to record student attendance. 
 
 “We have received no directives from the board on the app. Last year, the app wasn’t a success due to connectivity issues, particularly in rural centres,” said DIOS Umesh Tripathi.
 
 “We have been asked to record attendance of the students manually by taking their signature against their name on the nominal roll,” said a centre superintendent of a government-aided college. 
 
 Top officials in the board, however, said the revamped app will be used at exam centres. 
 
 “An improved version of the app is already out,” said a board official.
 
 Meanwhile, board officials have appealed to the teachers to not skip invigilation duty. The board has appointed around 4,800 invigilators for smooth conduct of examinations at 149 centres—19 government schools, 80 government-aided and 50 self-finance schools in Lucknow. There are 789 recognised UP Board schools in the city. Of this, 51 are government-run, 101 government-aided while 637 are private schools.
 
 The DIOS has instructed the centre superintendents to ensure CCTV cameras are functional at the exam centre. However, CCTV cameras missing at most exam centres, posing a challenge for the board.
