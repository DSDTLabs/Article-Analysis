LUCKNOW: Despite the euphoric response to the SP-Congress alliance in UP, the two parties are yet to resolve their differences over seat-sharing in the Gandhi family pocket boroughs of Amethi and Rae Bareli.

 Even though the   has pushed for total control in the twin districts comprising 10 assembly seats, SP chief   has only agreed, so far, to part with five of the 10 seats. 
 
 When TOI asked Rahul why the seat-sharing negotiations in the VIP districts were still stuck, he said: “These are internal discussions. There are a couple of small outstanding issues which are not very fundamental issues. We will take care of those issues.” He later added that these were only “peripheral” to the discussions with the SP leadership and that there was a broad understanding that the SP and Congress “are going to fight unitedly and defeat the BJP.” 
 
 The sticking point in the talks are believed to be Amethi and Gauriganj seats, from where the SP has repeated its incumbent MLA  , and  , respectively. Congress’s campaign committee chairman and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Sinh’s wife Amita, a former MLA, is keen to contest the polls on the Amethi seat, where she will be pitted against BJP’s Rani Garima Sinh, Sanjay Sinh’ first wife.
