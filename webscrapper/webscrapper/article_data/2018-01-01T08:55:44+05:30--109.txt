CHENNAI: The  , Chennai, booked a deputy director of the Employees State Insurance Corporation ( ) in   for allegedly giving monetary benefit to a yarn manufacturing company which was involved in a dispute over remittance of ESI for one decade.

 The CBI said that the company Ramalinga Mills in Aruppukottai was charged with not paying the ESI contribution of Rs 5.2 lakh and Rs 20.8 lakh during 2003-2006. Two claims were raised against the company and notices were issued, but it had filed appeals with the ESI court in 2007, which were pending.
 
 The accused ESIC DD  , who took charge in 2016, got the matter transferred from the court and back to him so he could register a favourable order for the company, the CBI alleged. 
 
 On June 30, the ESI court in Madurai set aside earlier orders and remitted the matter back to the DD to conduct a fresh enquiry.
 
 The CBI said that during the enquiry, Thineshkumar aided Ramalinga Mills by reducing the amounts, altering facts, earlier admitted by the company and giving it undue monetary benefits. He passed orders on October 6 which caused wrongful loss to ESIC, the CBI said.
 
 Thineshkumar also allegedly approached the company and negotiated an illegal gratification of Rs 3 lakh for giving them a favourable order, investigators said. This happened through an advocate M Elanchezian, who has been named in the FIR along with the company.
 
 A case of criminal conspiracy, cheating and criminal misconduct by a public servant has been filed by the CBI.
