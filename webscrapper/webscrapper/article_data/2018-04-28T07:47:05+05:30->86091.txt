KOCHI: With only three days left for meeting the deadline set by the government to pay   of Puducherry-registered vehicles running in Kerala, the Perumbavoor joint RTO office on Friday received the highest tax amount collected so far under special amnesty scheme, from Sayed Muhammed Nazeer of Perumbavoor.

 The owner of   Continental GT, worth Rs 3 crore, paid tax amount of Rs 60 lakh at the joint RTO office. The high-end car was registered in Puducherry. The vehicle is owned by Nazeer’s wife  , whose family runs business in the Middle East. 
 
 “They bought the vehicle one year ago and registered it in Puducherry for a meagre amount. But we collected tax amount of 20% of the total cost of the car. A total of six vehicles, registered in Puducherry, have paid actual registration fee in our office so far and collected a total of Rs 2 crore. We will give registration number to vehicles when they produce no-objection certificate from Puducherry office,” said Perumbavoor joint RTO N C  .
 
 “This must be the highest amount collected as tax from a vehicle registered in Puducherry,” said V  , joint commissioner (enforcement). As per the amnesty scheme announced in the budget, owners who registered their vehicles in Puducherry, could avert legal proceedings against them if they remitted the actual registration tax in the state before April 30.
 
 Meanwhile, more people come to pay registration tax for Puducherry vehicles in Ernakulam as the deadline is on Monday. About 34 vehicles have paid tax so far in Ernakulam RTO office, which garnered Rs 2.81 crore.
 
 “We expect more people to come forward to pay in the next two working days. There are 50 more vehicles which need to pay tax in Ernakulam RTO office. But owners of some of the vehicles have approached high court,” said K L Franklin, Ernakulam joint RTO.
 
 At the same time, 338 vehicle owners paid tax in Kerala till last Saturday and a total of Rs 27.79 crore was collected.
