Indore: Regional Transport Office (RTO) authorities of Indore seem to have geared up to meet their annual revenue target. This year, transport department has set a target of Rs 360 crore for Indore RTO. In the previous fiscal, the department had fixed a target of earning revenue of Rs 423 crore, but after the local RTO failed to collect more than Rs 300 crore till February, 2016, the target was reduced to around Rs 350cr. The RTO till December has been able to achieve 73.10 % of Rs 360cr. So far they have collected just over Rs.263cr. Collecting another Rs 97 crore in less than three months seems unlikely. However, officials are optimistic and said that the ongoing check against commercial vehicles is expected to help them meet the target. They said that they are seizing at least 10 vehicles every day and would manage to meet the target before the fiscal ends. “Instructions have been issued to speed up efforts to meet the revenue target,” said regional transport officer MP Singh. RTO had started a drive early this month in which they have managed to seize more than 150 vehicles and collect around Rs.16 lakh from them in fines. Most of the amount has come from vehicles whose owners have defaulted on payment of road tax. Besides this, a total amount of Rs.2.8 lakh has also been collected by imposed fine on vehicles that were running without permit. Some vehicles were also found violating fitness and pollution control norms, using pressure horns, overloading, unauthorized use of beacon and documents of drivers and conductors including licence and verification.
