NEW DELHI: The bill seeking to criminalise instant triple talaq will remain a political faultline dividing the government and the opposition, with the   leadership deciding against sending the legislation to a parliamentary committee despite being outnumbered in  . 

 Despite the opposition, including  , Left and regional parties; ally TDP, and friendly party AIADMK opposing the bill, the government decided to let the Muslim   (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2017 remain in limbo as the winter session drew to a close on Friday.
 
 Though the Centre had at one point considered acceding the demand, it decided that this might give opponents an easy way out. Keeping the bill pending will be a pressure point on the opposition, more particularly Congress which has reservations over matching the aggressive pro-minority positions of regional outfits like SP and Trinamool. 
 
 The decision to bring the bill to the House again when it meets for the Budget session allows the government, BJP members feel, to argue that its bid to provide relief to Muslim women from the arbitrariness of instant divorce is being thwarted due to considerations of vote-bank politics. 
 
 The issue is seen to play out to BJP’s support base too as it is seen as the party’s preparedness to take on rivals in reforming personal laws that are seen to be a nogo area for “secular” parties. 
 
 Congress, in turn, accused the Modi government of holding back the bill in Rajya Sabha, saying that the opposition’s just demand for scrutiny of some provisions had fallen prey to the saffron “abhorrence” for parliamentary procedures. Congress claimed it was in favour of the bill. Leader of opposition in RS   said, “ BJP is squarely responsible for this impasse in RS. For the first time, Union ministers and ruling party MPs were seen standing in Rajya Sabha and stalling Parliament... BJP wants to turn Parliament into a rubber stamp.”
