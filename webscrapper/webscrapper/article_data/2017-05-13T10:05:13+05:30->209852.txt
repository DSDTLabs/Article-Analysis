LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister   is against teachers’ involvement in duties other than teaching. Issuing instructions to principal secretary, secondary education, Sharma on Friday said teachers will only be involved in duties related to census, elections and occurence of a natural disaster. He asked the officials to prepare a proposal stating that teachers should not be allowed to work extra in various other works besides teaching. 

 However, teachers said that with election related activity round the year, they should not be involved at all. “There are   elections, assembly elections and municipal corporation elections. Teachers are taken for granted and asked to make voters lists. Teachers should be kept as the last option in carrying out all this work,’’ said   spokesperson RP Mishra. 
 
 Often, teachers spend a lot of time in getting mid-day meal cooked. If they are supposed to do all this, when will they teach, asked Mishra.
