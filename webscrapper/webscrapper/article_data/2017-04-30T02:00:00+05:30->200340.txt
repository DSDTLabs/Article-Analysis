PATNA: Mokama MLA   on Saturday walked out of Beur central jail after almost 22 months. He was granted bail by a special court in Gaya on Friday in a case lodged against him by former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s nephew Upendra Manjhi on February 16, 2015. Manjhi had accused Anant of using derogatory remarks against the former CM.

 Anant’s release from jail became possible only after the Supreme Court on April 12 set aside the Crime Control Act (CCA) invoked against him by the Patna district administration on September 5 last year. 
 
 The independent MLA moved away from the jail gate in a SUV with his supporters without any fanfare. He also refused to comment on his release or the CCA.
 
 Sources said Anant’s supporters welcomed him on his arrival at his native village Ladma in Mokama.
 
 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said police would remain extra vigilant in the Mokama area after the MLA’s release. It was on Manu’s proposal that Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal had recommended CCA against Singh.
