HYDERABAD: Though the state government is all set to launch its ‘Jalam-Jeevam’ initiative, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply & Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) officials are yet to decide on the fate of the existing rainwater harvesting structures that have been dug up on the   premises. The unified Andhra Pradesh government had undertaken a campaign to construct rainwater harvesting pits and had dug up around 25 pits across the Secretariat premisestodivert rooftop water.

 Butthese pitsspread over the 20-acre Secretariat Complex seem to have vanished, leaving behind just signboards marking the spot where they once stood.
 
 In one instance, a huge rainwater harvesting pit dug in front of the Secretariat branch of   has now become a garbage dump with a two-feet layer of mud covering it and unwanted flora growing over it.
 
 Sources in the Secratariat told 
  that nearly a decade back, the united AP government had spent nearly ₹50 lakh on the construction of rainwater harvesting pits but due to lack of proper maintenance by the Roads & Buildings (R&B) department, all these pits have turned into garbage dumps.
 
 The Telangana government now has to take up repairs and remove the mud   to give them a fresh lease of life under the  , said a n employee at the Secretariat.
 
 The government will have to dig up at least half a dozen of the existing pits to improve the groundwater levels of the Secretariat, he added.
 
 However, after the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, there seems to be no   on the premises as even parking spaces are hard to come across, making the construction of new harvesting pits a tough task.
 
 The Jalam-Jeevam programme aims to construct over 1,000 rainwater harvesting structures across the city to improve the city’s groundwater table. Currently, the water supplied by the HMWS&SB is being utilised for multiple purposes like drinking, cleaning, washroom maintenance and even gardening.
