MUMBAI: An online rental company is in a fix as a sessions court on Thursday rejected the bail plea of   arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of emcee  . The firm can neither recover the Rs 12,000 dues from Hazra nor take back its rented   as its officials cannot enter his Malad flat without his permission or that of his landlord’s.

 On December 11, 2017, Tiwari’s partially dressed body was found in the duct on the second floor of Manavsthal society, where Hazra lives on the 15th floor. Between May and August 2017, Hazra ordered four wardrobes, a study table, a large shoe rack and an office chair from the online rental company for nearly Rs 30,000. Each furniture was rented for a different time period, ranging from three months to two years. “As the dues started stacking up, I approached Hazra but he would avoid me. He owes us Rs 12,223, minus the deposit,” said Aamir Shaikh, senior executive with the firm’s recovery department. 
 
 “Malwani senior police inspector told us we need an NOC from Hazra and show it to his landlord, only then would police give us permission to enter his flat,” said Shaikh. “But Thane prison officials did not let my colleague meet Hazra; they said only his family members and lawyer can meet him in jail.” The firm is struggling to trace Hazra’s family. “Also, we don’t have the number of Hazra’s roommate Sarwan Singh, who had taken the delivery of furniture when he wasn’t at home.” —Nitasha Natu
