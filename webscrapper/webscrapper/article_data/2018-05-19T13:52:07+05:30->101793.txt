KOCHI: The high court on Friday said a comprehensive probe is required in the case where a minor girl alleged that she was sexually abused by reputed personalities while studying at a private school near  .

 
 A division bench of the court also directed that the woman and three minor children, aged 15, 12, and 6, be shifted to a hostel in the city.
 
 The court is considering a habeas corpus petition filed by the woman’s husband alleging that his family was illegally detained at a retreat centre named Unniesobhavan at   in Coimbatore, where ‘black mass’ is practised, after they went there to attend prayers.
 
 When produced before the court, the 15-year-old had told police that she was given sweets containing drugs and taken to religious institutions and abused between 2012 and January last year. When the case came up for hearing during the forenoon session on Friday, senior public prosecutor   submitted that the retreat centre is run by a priest and a woman, who were ousted by the church in   and that they and others helping them are running a parallel church there.
 
 The senior prosecutor also told the court that it is learned from the psychological counselling, as directed by the court, that the children were subjected to ‘brainwashing’ and that their statements differ. In such circumstances, a detailed police probe is required, the court was informed.
 
 When the case was heard again in the afternoon session, the court said a comprehensive probe is required and asked prosecution as to how many families are staying at the retreat centre. The senior prosecutor submitted that around 25 families are present there.
 
 He also pointed out that the woman with whom the family in the present case is staying also belongs to the group involved in running the retreat centre. Following this, the court interacted with the woman and children in chambers and directed to send them to a hostel in the city. The case will be heard by the court again on Monday.
