BENGALURU: French liquor company   Ricard said its sales in India rose 14% for the first nine months (July 2017-March 2018) of its fiscal compared with just 1% in the year-earlier period, which suffered from dwindling sales due to the impact of demonetisation.

 The company, the world’s second-biggest spirits maker behind Britain’s Diageo, said global sales rose 6.3% organically to about 7 billion euros, helped by higher revenue from Asia that rose 10%. The company attributed the Asia growth to the early onset of the Chinese new year and “strong growth” in India. Asia contributes 42% to the top line.
 
 With the “highway ban now fully implemented, no further disruption (is) expected. We are awaiting clarification from the GST council as to the scope of tax application,” the company said in an investor presentation on Thursday. This statement is in reference to the Supreme Court’s move to ban liquor outlets within a distance of 500 metres from highways.
 
 GST doesn’t include the alcoholic beverage industry. But raw materials used fall under its ambit thereby pushing up input costs for the industry. Pernod, maker of   whisky, has strategic international brands which include   and Chivas Regal Scotch. It sells wines under labels such as Jacob’s Creek, and   in the country.
