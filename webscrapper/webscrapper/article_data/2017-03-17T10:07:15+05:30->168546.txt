PUNE: After making a splash at the Kirloskar Vasundhara International Film Festival in the city earlier this year, filmmaker and   officer   is going global. His film ‘Chronicles of a Wildlifer’ will be screened at a film festival in New York.

 Talking to TOI, he said, “It is the only Indian film to be shortlisted for the Wildlife Conservation Film Festival (WCFF) in New York in October. It is a big achievement as among others showcasing their films at WCFF is broadcasting giant BBC.” 
 
 “The organisers of the festival were quite surprised to learn that the film was a one-person effort,” he added. Goswamy is also hopeful of recognition at the festival’s award ceremony, slated for September.
 
 The assistant commandant in BSF had won third prize at KVIFF. He also won a prize at the Calcutta Cult International Film Festival. Born into a family of defence officers, it was but natural that Goswamy would join the forces. However, along the way he picked up a passion for wildlife.
