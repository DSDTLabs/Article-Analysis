HYDERABAD: A woman rights activist branded her nine-year old son's private parts with a red-hot steel ladle for pestering her to return to his estranged father.

 The accused Anusha, 33, a rights activist from Shapur Nagar, Jeedimetla married  , an auto driver, in 2005. The couple had two sons. Anusha deserted him five months ago and moved to Bachupally with her children. “She applied for divorce. In Bachupally, she has been living with a financier,  ,“ said Jeedimetla sub-inspector,  .
 
 In past few months,  , who studies in class 4, began pressurising her mother to let him go and stay with his father in Sanga Reddy. “Anusha was not happy with her son's demand. To teach him a lesson, she branded him,“ the SI said.
 
 Anusha would often beat her son and make him do household chores, police said. Unable to put up with the torture, Harshavardhan took some money and left the house on Wednesday afternoon when his mother was away. “Harshavardhan met his father Murali and showed him the burns,“ the SI said. A case was registered against Anusha under Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt with dangerous weapons or means) of IPC and section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act.
