PANAJI: The  , forest and climate change ( ) has sought comments from a number of state and   over increasing the iron ore output cap in Goa.

 Around 10 central and state government departments have been asked for their views on the report prepared by the six-member expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court, which had recommended an extraction limit of 37 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of iron ore in the state.
 
 The panel, in its report, had suggested that the earlier assessed extraction rate of 20 MTPA be enhanced to 30 MTPA. It had further stated that the limit could be further increased to 37 MTPA “as the upper limit predicted by our sustainability model”, subject to the state’s review of the macro environment impact assessment ( ) of the enhanced extraction rate. 
 
 The committee has also underscored that the extraction rate needed to adhere to its probable EIA and other scientific, logistical and social implications.
 
 “A higher ore extraction rate (37 MTPA) can be sustained over a longer time horizon. Such an increase should be gradual and should take into account the impact of enhanced mining and creation of modern mining and other infrastructure,” the panel had opined.
