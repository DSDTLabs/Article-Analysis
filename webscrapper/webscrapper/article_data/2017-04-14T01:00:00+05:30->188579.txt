Actor  , who debuted on TV with the show Aur Pyaar Ho  , is back after two years in the second season of the show   Aur Baati Hum. Rajeev replaced  , and will play  , the second son of Bhabho who has issues with his wife. In the past two years, Rajeev decided to take a break and move to his hometown Jaipur where he pursued his other interests in life. He says, “I started a restaurant, got into construction and also travelled on my bike across India. Acting is my passion, but it’s nice to be involved in other things as well.”
Rajeev who has modelled abroad has done a few Bollywood films as well. During his modelling days, he travelled to 18 nations around the world and lived in eight countries. Having lived abroad, we ask him what he thinks of American television and films. “From the time I lived abroad to now, I have noticed that American television is more superior to American films. If you observe TV shows in other countries, an actor gets to play his age and establish his character on the show,” says Rajeev, who played father to a grown-up girl in his previous show. Ask him why he chose to play a much older character and he says, “Unfortunately, in Indian televison largely we are stuck with stereotypical characters. Most lead roles go to actors who look like college guys. I took up that role because it was interesting and I liked the mature character that I had to portray.”
 Meanwhile, he is glad to be a part of Diya Aur Baati Hum 2. About stepping into Karan’s shows, he says, “I’m not stepping into anyone’s shoes. I am only doing my best to justify the character that I’m playing. I can’t do what the past guy has done, so establishing my chemistry with Kanika Maheshwari in the show will be a challenge.”
