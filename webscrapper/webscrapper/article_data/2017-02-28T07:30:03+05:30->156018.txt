NASHIK: Industrialists from Nashik are planning to meet chief minister   and urge him to start   at the earliest and ensure new  . 

 The CM had pledged to adopt Nashik if the party comes to power in the civic body. As the BJP emerged the single largest party with a majority after the Nashik civic polls, a delegation of industries will meet CM to remind him his promise. 
 
 A meeting of all industrial associations, along with Confederation of Real Estate Developers' Association of India (Credai) Nashik, and  , was held here on Monday to discuss the issue. The meeting decided to meet the CM and raise the two issues. 
 
 A Nima office-bearer said, "We want air connectivity of Nashik and new industrial projects in Nashik. These will be the two main demands during our meeting with the CM."
 
 He added, "We have an international-standard airport at Ozar, but the air service is yet to take off from here. It is not possible without the government support. The city already has air service potentials. As per the present survey, around 50,000 people from Nashik fly to various destinations via Mumbai, Pune and other airports. Nevertheless, we still don't have flight operational from Nashik." 
 
 No large industrial project has come to the city during the past 10 years. This has affected the industrial growth of Nashik. MoUs worth Rs 7.95 lakh crore for Maharashtra were signed during the Make in India event in Mumbai. "But Nashik got investment less than 0.25% of the total MoUs," the Nima office-bearer said.
