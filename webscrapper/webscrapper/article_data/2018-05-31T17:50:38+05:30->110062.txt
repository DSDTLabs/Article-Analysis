Anushka Panda, a 15-year-old Gurgaon girl, had a bigger mountain to scale than most others who were appearing for the Class X   exams this year. The Suncity School, Gurgaon student has a genetic disorder that affects her spinal cord, restricting her to a wheelchair. Despite that, Anushka scored 97.8% marks in her boards, jointly topping the country among differently-abled students. Anushka was born with a genetic disorder known as   (SMA), which takes away the person’s ability to walk, eat, or even breathe without assistance. She admits that that does make studying a bit   for her, but she has learnt to adjust to it. “The disorder has always been there and it will always remain. But I have to study anyway and do all the other things as well. I thought I can’t let this get in my way.”

 Both of Anushka’s parents were at work when she saw her result. Anushka recounts, “I was really scared about my result. I was expecting something like 90% but never this. So, when I saw it, I screamed my lungs out. I just thanked God and called my parents because I wanted to share it with them immediately.” The Sector 67 resident says consistency was the key to her success in the board exams. “I started preparing since day one. I would study a bit every single day without creating too much pressure for myself,” she says.
 Anushka says that any disability or challenge cannot stop one from achieving what they want to if they follow their heart. She explains, “My message to any person, who faces any challenge in his/her life, is to follow the heart because when a person does that, no challenge or roadblock can stop him/ her. One should never think about obstacles.” She also has a tip for students who might aspire to follow in her footsteps. “I never wanted to be a topper. I just wanted to do well. Being the   should never be the aim,” sums up Anushka.
