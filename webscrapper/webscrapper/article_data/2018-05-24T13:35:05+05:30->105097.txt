VADODARA: Ever imagined a bike which can be rode not only by a four-foot tall person but also by somebody who is seven-foot tall?

 Well, three mechanical engineering students have designed a low-cost bike where the rider can increase or decrease its height according to his or her height. The bike not only has a feature where its height can be increased or decreased, but also has mono-shock air suspension due to which the rider will not feel any jerks.
 
 “It is actually the suspension which has a dual function of adjusting the height and shock absorption. Such suspensions are used in buses manufactured by   and high-end models of cars manufactured by Mercedes,” said Darshan Patel, who designed the bike with his friends Karan Joshi and Miten Soni as a part of their final year project. The project cost them Rs 1.5 lakh including the cost of the bike at resale rate.
 
 Patel said that they were inspired to design the bike on learning the applications of mono-shock air suspensions in the luxury bus and car. When the students researched further, they found that many biking enthusiasts have customized their high-end   bikes by installing such suspensions. “So far, these suspensions had been used in costly vehicles. Therefore, we decided to experiment with a low-cost bike,” said Patel, who recently finished his bachelor of engineering from Waghodiya-based ITM Universe. The students have modified a Pulsar 220cc bike to install these suspensions.
 
 A switch has been attached with the bike, on pressing, which, the height of the bike can be adjusted by one foot within three minutes. Patel added that since the suspensions have shock-absorbing technology, a rider will not get tired during cross-country and long distance tours.
 
 The three students are working on a research paper of their model following which they are going to apply for a patent of their design.
