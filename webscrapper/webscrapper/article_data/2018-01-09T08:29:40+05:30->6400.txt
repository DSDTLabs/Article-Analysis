I am really excited about the Pro   League starting in New Delhi on Tuesday, as I am participating in it for the first time.

 I watched a number of bouts very closely during the first two seasons. And I must say that a number of them are still very fresh in my mind; some of them I can perhaps never forget. On a personal note, I must say that I am looking forward to it for another reason. For the first time, my two children will be seeing me wrestle in a top-level event in the country. We celebrated both their birthdays just a few days ago; and I promised them a unique gift, that is to let them see me in action. I will be a little tense for sure but I will be keener to put up a good show for my kids.
 
 The interesting bit about wrestling as a sport is that it is almost impossible to predict which way it will go. Over the years, I have seen many of my friends and foes turning a lost cause into victory at virtually the last moment. Similarly, I have seen a few formidable names dominating the bout for the most part but somehow capitulating at the very end.
 
 I am happy to see the rising growth and popularity of the Pro Wrestling League. The organisers have done a wonderful job of bringing the worldâ€™s best wrestlers to the country and I urge fans not to miss the action at any cost. I do hope that we will have a cracking season which will grip the entire nation.
 
 I have a riveting opening contest against Virdev Giulya of the Mumbai Maharathi team in the 74-kg category. Giulya is a highly talented youngster, with immense potential.
