AHMEDABAD: Postgraduate medical admissions on the basis of NEET score across the country had come to a grinding halt on Tuesday after the Madras high court ordered the   (DGHS) to not allot seats to students both under the all-India quota and   state quota until further orders. 

 In Gujarat, too the court order has put everyone in a fix, as admissions to the   quota seats must end on April 26 as per MCI guidelines. There are a total of 1,308 PG seats that have be filled under the state quota based on NEET scores. Of these, 252 medical seats are those where applicants are yet to pay their fees or confirm their seats. 
 
 In the dental category there are 50 seats where students are yet to confirm their admissions. In all senior officials of the state health department claim, a total of 2,400 students had applied for PG seats. The officials add that one can go ahead with counselling, but may not be able to allot seats till further court orders. “After April 26 the whole process may turn out to be invalid,” said the health official.
