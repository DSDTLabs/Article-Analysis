MUMBAI: Even as the agriculture sector shows signs of recovery from the severe 2015  , the   industry is yet to get over it.

 The crushing season for 2016-17 has officially come to an end and it has recorded the lowest sugarcane crushing and production of sugar in the last 10 years. A total of 371.4 lakh metric tonnes of sugarcane was crushed in 147 mills across the state producing 417 lakh quintal of sugar. These figures are even lower than in 2008, when another severe drought had hit  .
 
 Officials say the price of sugar is expected to rise owing to the shortfall in production. Maharashtra is one of the largest producers of sugar in the country.
 
 “This has been an exceptionally difficult year with the losses mounting. This is bound to have a cascading effect next year,” said a senior official from the state sugar mills association. Sugar retail prices are hovering around Rs 38-40 as against the normal prices of Rs 32-34.
 
 The worse-hit at the moment are the sugarcane farmers, who have lost income to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore due to low production. The area under sugarcane cultivation shrank to 6.3 lakh hectares in 2015-16 due to the drought from 10.3 lakh hectares the year before. Thus the total sugarcane production in 2016 was 4.5 lakh metric tonnes against a total harvest of 7.3 lakh metric ton in 2015.
 
 The dip in sugarcane production is due to the  . Sugarcane is an 18-month crop and the cane sown in 2015 was harvested in the end of 2016.
 
 With one tonne sugarcane said to be fetching a minimum of Rs 2,000 for the farmers, even by conservative estimates they have made losses worth Rs 6,000 crore, say industry experts.
 
 They add that the total agriculture loss due to the severe drought in 2015 cannot be accounted for, but losses will continue to impact the farmers indirectly. Last year, a total of 178 sugar factories were operational; this year 31 didn’t even start operations due to lack of raw material. And 120 of the 147 that were working shut in January.
 
 Most of the mills are situated in the sugarcane belt of western Maharashtra and Marathwada. The industry has accrued cumulative losses of Rs 2,500 crore over the past few years and has asked the central government to restructure term loans worth Rs 6,500 crore for 10 years, including a moratorium of three years and seven years for repayment.
