NAGPUR: Divisional commissioner Anoop Kumar has ordered repolling for one booth of Nagpur division teachers’ constituency MLC elections, as the standard procedure was not followed by the booth staff.

 Now, counting for MLC election will be held on February 7 instead of February 6.
 
 Polling was held at this centre on Friday. The presiding officer and two junior clerks have been suspended for their callous behaviour. A complaint in this regard was lodged by Dilip Tadas, a voter.
 
 Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Kumar, who is the returning officer for the elections, said that repolling would be held on Monday for centre no. 25 located in Marathi Primary School, Nandanvan. “There are 570 voters in this booth. We will personally call each of them on their mobile phones and inform them about this decision,” he said.
 
 Presiding officer   and two junior clerks   and PT Lanjewar had conducted the election in extremely callous way. They had applied normal ink on the fingers of voters instead of indelible ink. Moreover, the voters were not provided purple sketch pen as mandated by the   (ECI). They were either given normal ballpoint pens or asked to use their own.
 
 “The three staffers have behaved most irresponsibly and, hence, they have been punished in an exemplary manner. We don’t want repeat of such incidents at any cost,” Kumar added.
 
 Some 468 of the total 570 voters had exercised their franchise from this booth, which translates into voting percentage of 82.71.
