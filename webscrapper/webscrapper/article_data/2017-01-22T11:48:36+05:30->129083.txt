BATHINDA: Murder-accused liquor baron   is still in the fray for the assembly election from Abohar seat, even though his family members had announced on Friday that Doda would support the BJP candidate from the constituency, Arun Narang, and withdraw from the poll contest.

 Doda’s nomination withdrawal form was rejected by the returning officer for the constituency on Saturday, citing that the document had not been signed by Doda, who is lodged in   at present.
 
 Doda and his nephew Amit are lodged in prison in connection with the December 11, 2015, murder of 25-year-old Dalit youth Bhim Tank. Though Amit had filed his papers as the covering candidate for his uncle, his withdrawal form was also rejected on the same grounds as that of the liquor baron on Saturday. While Shiv Lal has been allotted a bucket as the election symbol, Amit has got the air conditioner.
 
 Doda’s brother Avinash said even though the withdrawal forms had been rejected, they would “wholeheartedly support” the BJP candidate. “We submitted request forms for withdrawal of nominations of both within time on Saturday. We don’t have any official information about whether their request for withdrawal has been rejected or accepted,” he said.
 
 Abohar assembly returning officer Jaspreet Singh told TOI that the forms for withdrawal of candidatures were not signed by the nominees. “The requests were rejected on technical grounds. Both will remain in fray. Symbols have been allotted to them,” he said.
 
 However, Avinash said they would clarify their family’s supporters to vote for the BJP candidate. “We will join the BJP campaign and will ask our supporters to vote for the BJP, not us,” he added.
 
 Shiv Lal and Amit had filed nomination papers on January 13 after the court of Fazilka additional sessions judge Lachhman Singh had granted them interim bail to file nomination papers.
