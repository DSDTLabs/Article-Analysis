NEW DELHI: South Africaâ€™s squad for the upcoming  , scheduled across England from June 1-18, carries with it a familiar and unwanted question: can this be the team that finally shakes the 'chokers' tag and wins the silverware? 

 No South African cricket team has lifted any ICC tournament since the 1998 ICC Knockout. Since then, they have always found a way to exit in heartbreak. AB de Villiers will captain top-ranked   as they seek a first limited-overs title in 19 years.
