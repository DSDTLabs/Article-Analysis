AMRITSAR: Burnt bodies of a woman and her daughter were found inside their home in Amritrsar on Tuesday. While the woman's body was burnt beyond recognition, her daughter's body was found tied in semi-clad condition, making police believe that both of them were murdered in cold blood. 

 Amritsar additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP)   told TOI that the mother, aged 40, worked as a clerical staff in a government senior secondary school at Jandiala while her 19-year-old daughter was pursuing BCom. Police are, however, withholding their names.
 
 Walia said that the woman's son had gone abroad a few months ago. The mother-daughter duo lived in the house in   alone. The ADCP said that police were investigating the case from various angles. There was a possibility that knowing that two ladies were living alone some goons must have struck at their home at night or there could be some known person behind the incident, police said.
 
 Shubeg Singh, a neighbor of the victims, said at around 1.30am he had heard voices coming from outside and when he went out, he saw flames raging from the nearby house. Shubeg said he immediately informed the police and the fire brigade. "But when flames were doused, I came to know that both mother and daughter were charred to death," he said.
 
  said that police had registered a case against unidentified persons and begun investigations in the incident.
