NAVI MUMBAI: It’s a   of abundance for those who love the  . For, the supply of   to the city has more than doubled compared to last year. And thanks to this, prices have dipped to the lowest in five years. 

 Sources said around 1.2 lakh boxes (each containing four to six dozens) of mangoes reach the city every day from Devgad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and Raigad besides Karnataka and Kerala. As a result, mangoes are being sold at Rs 150-400 per dozen at Vashi   and Rs 200-600 in retail as against Rs 250-600 (wholesale) and Rs 300-800 (retail) during the same period last year.
 
 The   caters to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region besides Vapi, Surat, Silvasa, Daman and Diu. 
 
 This season, there’s been bumper production in the mango-growing areas of the Konkan belt and the coastal stretches in neighbouring Karnataka. “Prices were high in the last few years as crops were damaged due to unseasonal rains and unfavourable climatic conditions,” said Sanjay Pansare, a wholesale shop owner.
 
 While this year’s prices have brought cheer to consumers, they have left traders and growers unhappy. 
 
 “The glut in the market leads to around 30% damage during the sorting process. Karnataka mangoes are a bit cheaper. So consumers have a wide range of choice now,” added Pansare. 
 
 Some say consumers should exploit the present price situation as it will not dip further. “Many are waiting for prices to fall further. But they should understand the mango season has reached its peak,” said Anand More, a retailer.
