KOLKATA: At least two groups of youths on Friday held separate   outside Metro stations in different parts of the city, continuing their dissent against Monday night’s incident in which a   thrashed a young couple at the   station.

 
 Around 3.30pm, a group of students gathered outside the   station holding placards against moral policing and advocating for people’s right to privacy. Some even offered free hugs to random passengers.
 
 “We will continue this movement of spreading love. The city needs to change its mindset and if we can make people understand that hugging is as normal an act as shaking hands, they will stop reacting the way they do now when they see two persons of opposite sex holding hands or embracing each other in a public transport,” said Arnab Jana, a first year computer science student and a resident of Behala.
 
 The group even entered the Metro station and travelled in trains advocating against moral policing and distributing free hugs. Many youngsters who were passing by or travelling in the Metro also joined them randomly. “I was headed to Esplanade for shopping with some friends. When I saw the youths protesting against the incident, I accepted free hugs and even joined them for sometime. I believe everyone in the city should be part of such a positive movement,” said Gurpreet Kaur, a final year student of accountancy at Syamaprasad College.
 
 Around 5.30pm, there was another agitation outside the Dum Dum Metro station. “We voiced for immediate arrest of those who assaulted the duo and the man who molested the protesters on Thursday. We will continue this movement till the authorities are forced to take action,” said Anurag Moitreyee, one of the agitators.
