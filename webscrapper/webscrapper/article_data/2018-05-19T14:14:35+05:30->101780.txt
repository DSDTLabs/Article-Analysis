 By tradition, male members of the royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex has always been regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, The Telegraph reported.
 
 It would mean that Markle will be the first woman entitled to use the title 'Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex', the report said.
 
 The only previous Duke of Sussex was married twice, but neither of his marriages was approved by his father, George III, meaning they were considered unlawful.
