AMBALA: The district child welfare committee ( ) has recommended the chief medical officer ( ) to find out if it is possible to abort the foetus of the 13-year-old rape survivor, who is 22-week pregnant. The girl had got   after being raped by a 36-year-old married man in Ambala. The accused is husband of her mother’s sister.

 As of now, efforts of the police and DCWC to contact the rape survivor’s family in West Bengal have proved futile. After taking the consent of the minor rape survivor, the DCWC members have written to the doctors at the Ambala civil hospital to go ahead with medical termination of pregnancy, if possible.
 
 DCWC member Dr   said consent of the rape survivor was taken as her parents could not be approached or contacted after which they have used their discretionary powers and wrote to the Ambala CMO to go ahead with the   if possible.
 
 After the recommendation, CMO Dr   has constituted a board of doctors comprising three gynaecologists, including one senior medical officer (SMO) Dr   and medical officers Dr Rajni and Dr Apoorva, to give their opinion.
 
 The doctors have admitted the girl to first treat her for anaemia. She would be kept under observation for at least two days. “Her haemoglobin level is very low and the need to give her blood is being felt. Besides this, some injections of iron and sucrose will also be given to the patient. We are trying our best to treat her in as little time as possible because she is already 22 weeks pregnant and the risk to her life would only increase with the time,” Dr Gupta said.
 
 Gupta added that when pregnancy crosses 20 weeks, the doctors cannot perform abortion legally. “Abortion in such cases is supposed to be performed at higher medical institutes,” he said.
 
 “Now after the DCWC members have requested, we have constituted a board of three members. If the board gives a positive opinion on abortion, we will probably refer the girl to a higher institute,” added the CMO.
