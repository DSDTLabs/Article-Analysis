NEW DELHI: Without mentioning it, Union minister   managed a well-aimed swipe at Pakistan while "deploring"  's recent missile tests.

 At a trilateral meeting with the US and Japan, the external affairs minister made it a point to say that North Korea's "proliferation linkages must be explored". 
 
 It has long been suspected - and some say proven - that Pakistan is the mother lode of North Korea's nuclear programme.
 
 "The external affairs minister deplored North Korea's recent actions and stated its proliferation linkages must be explored and those involved must be held accountable," said external affair spokesman Raveesh Kumar, reported ANI
 
 Successive US administrations have known of the 
  via   inputs. In fact, Abdul Qadeer Khan, the "father" of Pakistan's atomic bomb, confessed in 2004 to selling nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya. 
 
  
  
 
 Earlier this month, Pakistani nuclear physicist,  , told Germany's Deutsche Welle media outlet that there was "complicity at a very high level", indicating that AQ Khan didn't act alone. Hoodbhoy said "it is very hard to believe that AQ Khan single-handedly transferred" all this technology from Pakistan to North Korea.
 
 "...it was a high-security installation in Pakistan and guarded with very fearsome amount of policing and military intelligence surrounding it. Moreover, the centrifuge weighs half a ton each and it is not possible that these could have been smuggled out in a match box, so certainly there was complicity at a very high level," said Hoodbhoy to Deutsche Welle.
 
 Last week, India and Japan also made a veiled reference to Pakistan in a 
  they release after talks between Prime Minister   and his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe. 
 
 The joint statement condemned North Korea's nuclear programme as a grave threat to global peace and stressed on holding accountable all parties supporting the nation's nuclear ambitions.
