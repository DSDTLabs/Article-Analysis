CHENNAI: Hyderabad may be the best   to select for Chennaiites as fares and   for   are cheaper than in Bengaluru, for advance booking for a weekend travel. Travel and tour operators say that as more and more domestic travellers prefer to go on holiday during weekends, Hyderabad may come cheaper for a quick two-day holiday this month. 

 When compared to Bengaluru, which is preferred by young executives because of its cosmopolitan character, Hyderabad has better connectivity by air as there are 16 flights a day while there are only the seven to eight flights a day to Bengaluru. 
 
 Consequently, Chennai-Hyderabad one-way fare for two weeks advance booking is in the range of 2,000 to 4,000 when booked two weeks in advance, while on Chennai-Bengaluru route a one-way flight ticket costs upwards of 3,400. 
 
 Basheer Ahmed of   says that weather was the only negative point that dissuades domestic tourists from heading to Hyderabad. 
 
 "There are a lot of tourist spots, including   film city and many other attractions in the 200km radius of the capital of Telegana state. There is a good demand during peak tourist season in April and May, because families and business travellers shuttle between Chennai and Hyderabad," he added.
 
 An airline official said that fares were higher on Bengaluru route because demand remained the same throughout, while it fluctuated on the Hyderabad sector. More airlines, including regional airlines, fly between Chennai and Hyderabad because of the demand from business travellers and traders.
