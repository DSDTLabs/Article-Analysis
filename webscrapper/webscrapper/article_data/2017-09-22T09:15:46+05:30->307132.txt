BENGALURU: As residents continue to negotiate the  , which only increases every time it rains, the government says extensive testing has found it is not being generated by toxins. 

 Additional chief secretary Mahendra Jain told TOI that analysis of water samples by the   (KSPCB) revealed it didn't contain any   that can cause foaming. "The methane in the surface air was 0.2%, whereas it has to be a minimum of 5% to catch fire," the examination found. 
 
  "It's (foam) largely due to the presence of phosphorus in detergents we all use, which finds its way into the sewage - treated or untreated. We have requested the Cen tre to ban phosphorus, which may address the problem to a significant extent," he said. 
 
  He pointed out that the frothing doesn't happen in the lake. It occurs where the water overflows and falls into the channel downstream. "We tried gentle ramps to reduce the velocity and impact, besides using a siphoning system to release overflowing water through pipes, coir mats to absorb the impact and sprinklers to reduce the foam, but all these techniques fetched limited results. Till we treat all the sewage, which may take three or four years, a permanent solution will be evasive," he said. 
 
  Not just Bellandur Lake, the whole city needs 100% treatment of sewage. With no river or ocean to flow into, all wastewater flows through a series of interconnected tanks, polluting even the groundwater. In  , wastewater is diverted from the side and led into the downstream channel, but in case of  , it is not diverted but flows over the waste weir into the downstream channels, and the agitation causes phosphorus to lead to foam formation.
