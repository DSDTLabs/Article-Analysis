HYDERABAD: To ease the city traffic flow, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation will roll out a new parking policy. In a meeting organised for hoteliers, shopping mall owners and marriage hall owners on Friday at Lower Tank Bund, Hyderabad Mayor   said the new parking policy will be announced soon. "I request the mall owners, hoteliers and function halls to provide adequate parking place," said the mayor. 

  Special parking complexes will come up in open lands to ease traffic, and multi-level parking will be implemented under PPP mode."We have identified some lands, and are identifying more open lands to construct multi-level parking," said a top   official.
 
 The policy will be initially implemented in GHMC limits, and will later spread to other municipal corporations also.
 
 Parking has been classified into different categories like street parking, open-space parking, short-stay parking, residential parking, parking in MMTS stations and metro stations. Open-space parking will be used primarily for heavy vehicles. Street parking will be implemented on roads wider than 12 metres. Minister for   T   also announced benefits such as additional built-up space for buildings, providing additional parking floors and property tax exemption.
