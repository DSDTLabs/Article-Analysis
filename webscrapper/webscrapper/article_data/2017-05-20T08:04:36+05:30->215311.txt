NEW DELHI: A   out to replenish an   was looted by   on a bike on Friday afternoon. 

 Around 2pm, the van with three occupants apart from the driver, parked outside a   in  . Two cash custodians and the guard had only stepped out of the van when two men   came out of nowhere and accosted the men. “The assailants had come prepared. They first took out a pepper spray can and sprayed it on the eyes of the custodians. Temporarily blinded and writhing in pain, the men couldn’t do anything. One of the robbers held the trio at gunpoint while the other started taking out the cash,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 Then one of the custodians named Naveen tried to resist. They shot him in the face. A profusely bleeding Naveen collapsed to the ground even as the duo fled. The van’s guard then fired twice at the fleeing men but missed. 
 
 Police were called and Naveen was rushed to a hospital where he was admitted to the ICU. “The injured man is not in a position to give his statement. We have approached the bank to know exactly how much cash has been looted,” the officer said. A rough estimate pegged it at Rs 19 lakh. 
 
 “Six special teams have been formed to probe the case,” said DCP Rishi Pal. 
 
 Police have also been trying to find out if an insider had tipped off the criminals. The robbers were probably tailing the cash van. 
 
 Police are also surprised as to who the guard, who had been hired only four days earlier, fired twice and missed on both counts.
