LUCKNOW:   MP  , who had earlier accused the central and state BJP governments of being anti-Dalit, demanded martyr status for all those who died in violence during Bharat Bandh on April 2 and a compensation of Rs 50 lakh each for their families. The MP, who had significantly toned down her angst against the government, said that she was not opposing her party or government but only making certain demands from them to improve the condition of Dalits and backwards.

 Phule addressed a press conference here on Wednesday even as BJP chief Amit   was meeting chief minister   in Lucknow. The MP said that she “would see” whether she would meet Shah in during his visit to the state capital. On March 28, Phule had spoken out against the possibility of ending reservations for Dalits and backward classes and held a rally on April 1 in Lucknow against the “anti-SC/ST policies of the government”. During the rally, she had said that she would seek an appointment with the PM or Shah to discuss the worrying trend of increasing harassment against Dalits.
 
 “Dalits are already quite suppressed and cannot afford to indulge in a bloody revolution. Their protest on April 2 was overtaken by some antisocial elements while videos have also emerged of police indulging in vandalism. I demand that none of these people should be spared. There are a number of cases of caste violence being reported from across the country and no effort is being made to curb these atrocities,” she said, saying that she would fight for Dalit rights whether or not she remained an MP.
 
 The MP has asked for a caste census, declaration of April 2 as Bahujan Swabhiman Day, reservation for Dalits in promotions, reservations for Dalits in defence and legal services, reservations in the private sector.
