Panaji: The Council for Social Justice and Peace (CSJP) has maintained that the anonymous video clips circulating on social media are “devious and feeble attempts by vested interests to target the Church in order to deviate public attention from pressing and contentious issues and policies which have unified people across Goa in expressing their legitimate concerns”. The video clips are the work of elements who are “frustrated and upset” over “CSJP’s support to the people across Goa who have been voicing their legitimate concerns about the planning and development authorities (PDAs), outline development plans (ODPs) and the regional plan,” executive secretary Fr Savio Fernandes stated in a pressnote.  Responding to allegations in one video that the Church has struck a secret deal with a political party, the CSJP, the social work wing of the Archdiocese of Goa and Daman, has said that although the Church is “inherently apolitical in nature and does not support or reject any particular party”. It further stated that “the CSJP does and should exercise its right and responsibility to question the policies of the government which go counter to the genuine interests of the people”. The timing of the release and circulation of the video clips, just ahead of the public meeting at Lohia Maidan, Margao, on Friday has been a “deliberate and devious attempt to confuse and mislead the people, cast aspersions on the Church and its policies, resort to allegations and to take instances and events out of context,” it further stated. The CSJP said it is in the process of ascertaining the allegations levelled against the Church in the video clips and says it will probe the matter in its proper context.
