CHANDIGARH: With the ongoing tussle between BJP municipal councillor   and medical officer of health PS   far from being over, Kalia will soon meet adviser to the Chandigarh administrator   along with party's Chandigarh unit president   on the issue. Kalia told TOI that he had been taking all steps to send Bhatti back. "If the officers will not co-operate, then I will be left with no option, but to sit on a dharna," he said. 

 Kalia has been pressurizing all senior officials concerned of the municipal corporation to repatriate Bhatti to his parent state, as he had allegedly misbehaved with him and had also been constantly removing employees from the sanitation department.
 
 "Both myself and Sanjay Tandon, will meet the adviser to the UT administrator and apprise him of the situation. We will also request him to repatriate the medical officer of health. I have been taking the right path to send him back and if my plea is not be attended, then I will decided my next course of action and sit on a dharna," Kalia told TOI.
 
 The BJP municiapl councillor sat on dharna in the well of the general house during its meeting on Monday, demanding immediate repatriation of Bhatti. He was later pacified by his fellow colleagues, who took him back to his seat, but Kalia kept asking the officials concerned of sending Bhatti back to his parent state.
 
 While replying on the issue, municipal commissioner   told Kalia that any issue related to repatriation related to the Chandigarh administration and the municipal corporation had nothing to do with it.
