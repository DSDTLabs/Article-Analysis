NEW DELHI:   president  , who was away abroad for a "health check-up" since early March, returned to a politically much-changed India today. 
 
 Sonia was accompanied by her son Rahul, who flew out of India March 16 to escort her back. The party didn't officially say where Sonia went for her check up, but some sources told TOI she went to the US.
 
 The ailing Congress chief didn't campaign in the February-March Assembly elections in five states. Nor was she here on vote-counting day.
 
 The Congress president was therefore away when the   came back to power in  , in a thundering landslide victory, also winning Uttarakhand and managing to cobble together coalitions headed by it in Goa and in Manipur.
 
 To be sure, Sonia's also back to see the Congress back in power in Punjab where it won a convincing victory.
 
 Sonia has been out of action for much of the time since she took ill during a roadshow in Varanasi last August. At the time, she was flown in to Delhi and admitted to the Army's Research and Referral Hospital before being moved to Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. Gandhi was again admitted to Sir Ganga Ram in November for viral fever and then discharged a few days later.
