BANTWAL: The   ran into a major controversy on Friday after its leaders directed a performer to finish singing ' ' "in just one line" as   president   was allegedly running out of time at the meeting in Bantwal.

 
 "Vande mataram vande mataram, sujalam suphalam malayaja sheetalam, sasyashyamalam maataram, vande mataram," was all the singer could sing. The crowd was left looking at each other, wondering what had transpired. It later emerged that party leaders had directed the singer to finish the song in one line.
 
 A TV channel aired a video of Rahul showing his watch to K C Venugopal, AICC general secretary and   in-charge, apparently to suggest that they are running out of time. With the singer having arrived on the dais, Venugopal immediately directs her to finish the song in one line. Others on the stage, too, are seen and heard telling her to cut short the song. The video grab went viral on social media.
 
 The BJP spared no time to air its reaction. "Rahul Gandhi directs to cut Vande Mataram to a single line during a public rally in Karnataka. Now this is why we call Him "Sahzada". His sense of entitlement is appalling..thinks this country is family property..can at his wish amend the National Song?" tweeted BJP national spokesperson Sambit Patra.
 
 "If Rahul doesn't have time to respect this song, he should quit politics to uphold the sacrifice of our freedom fighters," said BJP national president Amit Shah.
