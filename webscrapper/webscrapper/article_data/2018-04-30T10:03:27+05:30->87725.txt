PUNE: The summer scorcher has triggered a rush to cooler climes. And no, it is not Europe or Switzerland that’s high on the popularity stakes but exotic island getaways of Mauritius, Reunion Islands and Seychelles.

 If you are wondering why, here is the reason: In a few days from now while Puneites will be sweating out in the blistering heat, there will be winter in Mauritius and Reunion Islands. Seychelles too experiences pleasant weather as cool southeast trade winds blow from May onwards.
 
  
  
 
 Apart from the weather, better air connectivity and ease in visa process have also tilted the scales in favour of these destinations.
 
 “April, being the transition month, is also considered the best time to visit the archipelago. Reunion Islands, located on the east of Madagaskar, has emerged as a popular destination. Winters begin in May here and the temperature in April and May varies between 24-22°C. In Seychelles, cool southeast trade winds blow from May to November. Also, May marks a relatively dry period with mostly clear skies and very little drizzle,” said Karan Anand, head, relationships, Cox & Kings.
 
 He said that though Europe remains a popular destination in summer, lately island getaways such as Mauritius, Reunion Island and Seychelles have caught the attention of summer travellers.
 
 Varun Chadha, chief operating officer, Tirun, the India representative for Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd, said that since it gets warm here, most like to head to popular destinations like Mediterranean to get the best of weather. “Asia, in particular Singapore, continues to be the most popular summer destination due to shorter duration cruises,” he said.
 
 For inbound tourists, Leh, Kashmir, and the northeast are popular destinations. “Pune accounts for 8% of the total international travel from across India while Mumbai accounts for 9.7%,” said Manheer Singh Sethi, co-founder, Travkart, a travel service portal.
