When PM Narendra   called it “a homage in silence, expressed in action,“ many young Malay Indians, listening raptly to PM's community reception speech in Kuala Lumpur in 2015, had no idea of Mahatma Gandhi's rich legacy lying somewhere obscure in their own country,  . 

 PM was referring to a multi-purpose hall for Indians, with Gandhi at the centre of its identity. Around 60 years later, now worn down, this place is in the process of getting a facelift, with a 7.3mx2.4m 3D image of Mahatma Gandhi being embossed at the exterior.
 
 In the 1950s, the small, sleepy town of Sungai Petani in Kedah district of Malaysia, with its sizeable population of workers of Indian origin had come together to set up a   for Gandhi after his death in 1948. Though Indian migrants' strong emotional linkages with the cause of India's Independence is recorded history, a mention of the memorial by the Indian PM surprised many in the audience. He had said, “you had not met him, Gandhiji did not manage to visit Malaysia, but he touched your hearts.“
 
 Hearts he had touched, for, otherwise how can one explain the enthusiasm of thousands of rubber plantation workers coming forward to donate 3 days' wages to the Committee formed for setting up the memorial? Balan Nair, the current chairman of the management committee of the Gandhi Memorial Hall, reminiscing about the workers' contribution, said, “They were drawn to Gandhi's advocacy of `unity, equality and brotherhood of man,' familiar as they were with economic and social challenges in their own surrounding. They also idolised him for his indomitable spirit and patriotism for their home country .“
