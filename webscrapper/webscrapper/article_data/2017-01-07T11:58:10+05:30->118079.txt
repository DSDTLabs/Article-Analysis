CHENNAI: Congress leader   on Friday lodged a complaint with the director general of police, demanding action against BJP workers who posted obscene messages against her on social media for speaking out against the demonetisation policy. 

 Addressing the media outside the DGP's office, Jothimani said she had initially ignored the abusive posts. "But it got worse and I even received a couple of threatening calls. I have now approached DGP T K Rajendran."
 
 The Congress leader said she submitted along with her complaint the mobile phone numbers of 22 people who trolled her, along with a 70-page document containing screenshots of the messages sent to her. "These messages are not something I can reproduce or announce. It's a shame."
 
 Pointing out that she suspected the state BJP leader was behind the threat calls to sher, she said, "I can recognise the voice."
 
 The police chief had promised to take action, she added.
 
 On December 31, Jothimani had put up a Facebook post with screenshots of a 'WhatsApp' group whose members had been making sexual remarks against her, in response to earlier posts asking if Prime Minister   would resign after the 50-day post-demonetisation period had passed.
 
 In a series of tweets, Jothimani condemned the virtual sexual assault along with screenshots of the abusive messages. With minutes her supporters began trending with #standwithjothimani. Senior journalists, women's activists and politicians raised their voices. "She is a mid-level leader. If this can happen to her it can happen to many other women," said a senior advocate.
 
 For nearly two days, her posts went viral, even as the trolls continued. "They will not be able to so openly attack me without some kind of political backing," she said.
