 needs no introduction and her popularity on both-small screen and silver screen is increasing rapidly.

 The mother of two children was always in news with her racy outfits and decent sex appeal, which has garnered her fame at the first place. 
 
 The anchor has turned down several opportunities that came her way to star in films until Akkineni Nagarjuna's 'Soggade Chinni Nayana' was offered. The anchor turned dancer in the film and shook a leg with the actor. 
 
 Industry insiders now suggest that the anchor was roped in for the upcoming film of Ram Charan with Sukumar, which is shooting at the picturesque locales of Rajahmundry. If rumours are to be believed, we get to see Anasuya in yet another role with substance in the big ticket film. 
 
 Anasuya had impressed audience with her acting in Adivi Sesh's 'Kshanam' and sizzled in a special song titled 'Suya Suya', written after her name in mega hero Sai Dharam Tej's 'Winner' which had hit the screens recently.
 
 Let us hope to see Anasuya in another substance oriented character in this film which has Samantha Ruth Prabhu as the female lead. Jagapathi Babu plays another important role in the movie which is bankrolled by Mythri Movie Makers.
