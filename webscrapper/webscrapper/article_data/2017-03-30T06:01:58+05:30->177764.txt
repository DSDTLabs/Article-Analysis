AHMEDABAD: The much awaited   Self-Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Bill, 2017, is all set to be discussed. The bill aims to prevent self-financed schools in the state from charging exorbitant fees. The government plans to put in place stringent provisions — such as the cancellation the registration of schools — for charging fees not approved by the fee-regulating committee headed by a retired high court judge.

  The new bill, which is likely to be tabled in the state assembly on Thursday, proposes a Rs 5 lakh penalty on schools for the first offence of overcharging. For the second offence, the fine would be between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh. If a school violates the norms for the third time, its registration may be cancelled or its no-objection certificate withdrawn.
 
 The NOC of the state government is required for an affiliation to the   or the   among others bodies. “While moving the bill, the education minister is likely to declare a ceiling for the year 2017-18,” an official said. “And schools wanting to charge more fees than stipulated will have to approach the fee-regulation committee.” The government has made it clear a member of the committee can’t be older than 65 at the time of appointment. The bill may make private schools affiliated to the state board,  , and ICSE among others cut fees by almost 50%. Currently, private schools charge between Rs 30,000 and Rs 2.70 lakh per annum. Sources say the move will benefit parents of nearly 15 lakh students in Gujarat. The bill states that the apart from fees fixed by the committee, schools will not be able to charge any other fee, including for library, laboratory, examination, admission, or physical education. The bill states that the term fee — which is charged twice a year — and the admission fee cannot be higher than a month’s tuition fee. To charge higher fees, schools will have to submit their book of accounts to the committee for consideration.
