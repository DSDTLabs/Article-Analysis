VADODARA: Is   (VMC) eyeing to construct a   on a plot of land owned by   (MSU)? That seems to be a distinct possibility if a proposal put before the   is anything to go by.

 A row has been sparked regarding the proposed housing project at Karelibaug. The VMC had prepared a proposal in 2014 to construct a   (MIG) housing scheme there. The proposal was never taken up by the standing committee of the civic body. It has now been taken on agenda for the committee’s meeting on Saturday.
 
 The civic body has planned a scheme of 372 apartments at the site. The scheme has been proposed under Mukhyamantri Gruh Yojana (MGY). Earlier, a lower income group (LIG) scheme was planned at the site but was done away with and the MIG scheme was planned.
 
 It has come to light that the plot was owned by MSU and was handed over to it by VMC itself. A parcel of 4,678.40 square metre land belongs to MSU since 1993 when the university had received the land in lieu of the expansion of roads undertaken by VMC in Fatehgunj and Pratapgunj areas. 
 
 “We have written to VMC protesting against the move. The civic body should not have done this without our knowledge and consent of the university’s syndicate body,” said MSU engineer N K Ojha. 
 
 Earlier, too MSU had objected when the corporation had given permission to host garba on the land without its knowledge. A letter from the deputy commissioner of VMC some time back had confirmed that the university had irrevocable rights over the piece of land. The letter had mentioned that henceforth the civic body will not allocate the land to any private party for any purpose. 
 
 VMC executive engineer Shailesh Mistry said the proposal was old. “I have been told about the issue of the ownership of land. The standing committee may not necessarily clear the project in its present form,” said Mistry.
