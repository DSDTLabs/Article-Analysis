KOLKATA: Unidentified persons barged into  's   unit under   police station at  , around 36km from Darjeeling, on Thursday night and looted a stockpile of 480 gelatin sticks - enough to blow up a three-storey building. 

 Police said the gelatin sticks, an explosive material consisting of collodion cotton dissolved in either nitroglycerine or nitroglycol and mixed with wood pulp and saltpeter, is one of the cheapest forms of explosives that burns slowly and cannot be set off without a detonator. 
 
 Cops said the robbers had their faces covered and carried fire torches as they looted the stockpile. A complaint was registered on Friday.
