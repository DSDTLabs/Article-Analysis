BHOPAL/JABALPUR: Shah Rukh Khan starrer ‘Raees’ faced protest on the day of its release in Jabalpur town where members of a right wing group tried to stop screening of the movie. 

 A group of around 100 people, led by an outfit,  , took to the streets burning posters of the lead actor on Wednesday. Police had to use mild force to disperse the mob.
 
 Additional force was deployed outside Samdaria and South Avenue Mall, where protesters attempted to barge into the mall. At least 50 demonstrators were arrested.
 
 The demonstrators were against giving a lead role to Pakistani actress  , one of the many Pakistani artistes, who have been banned by the   (IMPPA) from working in India till relations between the governments of neighbouring countries improve. The ban was made in the aftermath of the Uri attacks.
 
 “Pakistan is spreading terror in India and their people are earning from here,” said one of the demonstrators. While many Pakistani actors had chosen to keep mum during this tense period, Mahira expressed her views by sharing a post of fellow Pak artiste Alizay Jaffer. She had posted, “It's strange, this affinity with India. I find myself getting increasingly upset at the abuse and hatred tossed from one border to another with little rationale apart from the 69-year-old chips on our shoulders. These chips have, over time, turned into boulders, and who doesn't crumble under the weight of those?” 
 
 Another reason for the agitation, they said, was the movie was focused on life of Abdul Latif, the liquor mafia from Gujarat who died in a police encounter on November 29, 1997.
 
 “Latif is an accused of 1993 bomb blasts in Mumbai. Why should a traitor be portrayed as a hero?,” said another youth, who was part of the team which demonstrated against the movie.
