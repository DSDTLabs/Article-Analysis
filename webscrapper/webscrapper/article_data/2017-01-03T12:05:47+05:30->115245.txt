AMARAVATI: In a major move boosting the employment opportunities for the jobless youth in the state, chief minister   on Monday declared the capital city Amaravati a 'free zone'. 

 He said keeping the capital city free from zonal regulations would help youth from all the regions of the state get an opportunity to work in Amaravati and prosper. Addressing a public meeting after dedicating the Muchumarri lift irrigation scheme in Kurnool district, the chief minister said Amaravati would be made a free zone soon.
 
  The CM chose to announce the key decision of making the capital city a free zone from a Rayalaseema district, Kurnool, to win over the youth. The state government received inputs from intelligence agencies that youth, particularly from north coastal and Rayalaseema districts, are shifting loyalties to the main opposition after a series of public meetings held by   chief   targeting the state government for unable to secure the special category status (SCS) from the Centre. 
 
  In this context, the decision to make the capital city a free zone is likely to help the ruling TDP to attract youth into its fold, a senior political analyst averred. The move is aimed at putting an end to the growing disenchantment among the youth who feel that the state government is focussed only on the capital city and ignoring the development of backward regions of north-coastal and Rayalaseema. 
 
 All the 13 districts in the state have been divided into four zones for recruitment to government services and promotion purposes.
 
 While Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam are part of Zone-I, East Godavari, West Godavari and Krishna district are in Zone-II. Guntur, Prakasam and Nellore district are zone-III and four Rayalaseema districts - Kurnool, Kadapa, Anantapur and Chittoor are in Zone-IV. While district is being treated as zone for filling up and promotions of all the Group-IV and below rank posts, Group-III and Group-II posts are zonal level posts.
