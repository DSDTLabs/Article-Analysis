JAIPUR: The state Congress on Tuesday organised a rally in the city to protest against hike in petrol and diesel prices under the BJP government. 

 Congressmen rode on bullock-carts, camel-carts, horses and cycle-rickshaw, while many walked from the Youth Congress office near Collectorate to the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) headquarters near Chandpole.
 
 PCC chief  , who led the protest, demanded that fuel prices should be reduced as international crude oil prices have dropped. Pilot accused BJP of going back on its “written promise” to reduce the petrol-diesel prices.
 
 The Congressmen at the rally highlighted how BJP leaders used to protest against any rise in fuel prices under the previous UPA governments at the Centre but were now justifying the ‘unreasonable and frequent’ increases in petrol-diesel prices. 
 
 The Congress claimed cooking gas price has doubled in past three years under the BJP government.
 
 Congress spokesperson   said the party would now hold a statewide protest against hiked fuel prices on September 28. Khachariyawas said fuel prices in India were high even though international crude oil prices were presently around $ 50 per barrel. 
 
 Under the UPA governments, the international oil prices were around $ 120 per barrel, still fuel prices here were very low as compared the petrol-diesel prices now under the BJP government,” said Khachariyawas.
