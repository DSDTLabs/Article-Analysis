PANAJI: Stating that their strategy is to defeat BJP in the coming state assembly elections, senior   leader   on Tuesday clarified that the party is going to fight the polls on its own, with a ‘seat sharing agreement’ in a few constituencies.

 “This BJP government has taken U-turns on every poll promise. Our strategy is to inform people door-to-door about these U turns. We are in no formal alliance with anyone and have a strategic seat-sharing agreement which is subject to discussion with state leaders,” Singh said, adding that the party will release its manifesto on January 23. 
 
 “The   (RSS) is the core of the BJP. They do all their ground work. The choice of words that Velingkar has used for the BJP tells me that they will have a problem this time. This election is an individual test for  , who has been taking U-turns,” he said. 
 
 Singh defended the party’s decision to not form an alliance with  , stating that they were nowhere to be seen during the last four and a half years. “NCP gets active when elections are near. They were nowhere when Congress was fighting the BJP government,” Singh said.
