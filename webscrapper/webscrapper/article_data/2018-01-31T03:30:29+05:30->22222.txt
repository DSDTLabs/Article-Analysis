NEW DELHI: A fortnight after the stunning press conference by four senior-most Supreme Court judges that laid bare the rift between CJI Dipak Misra and them, two of the four judges shook hands with the CJI in public for the first time after the event.

 The launch of Supreme Court Bar Association’s (SCBA) in-house journal ‘SCBA Times’ brought the CJI and two of the senior judges — Justices   and   — along with other SC judges on a common platform and the CJI exchanged greetings with them and shook hands. 
 
 However, Justices   and  , the two other judges who had revolted against the CJI, were not present at the launch.
 
 The CJI launched the journal in the presence of law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in the Supreme Court premises. The CJI and Prasad hailed it as a historic moment and said the journal would go a long way in allowing those from the legal fraternity to express their views on issues of national importance.
 
 The minister said the journal would be meaningful even in the present era of “online explosion” of news. He added that the platform should be used to discuss national issues and matters like holding simultaneous elections.
 
 SCBA president and senior advocate Vikas Singh said a permanent editorial board would be set up to publish the journal and the board would be kept insulated from SCBA office-bearers. The journal will be distributed free among the 16,000-odd members of the SCBA.
