LUCKNOW: Even as it gears up to woo investors in the state, mounting dues towards thermal power plants, including private ones, have come to stare in the face of UP government. 

  owes around Rs 3,500 crore to some of the major power plants such as  , NHPC, Lalitpur power plant and   power plant. The situation could turn serious as Lalitpur Power Generation Company has issued a letter to   saying it does not have enough funds to buy coal and keep its units functioning. In a letter dated January 12, the company said that outstanding dues by December-end had crossed Rs 1,200 crore. Of these, over Rs 830 crore had been pending for 60 days. 
 
 The company said the situation was "worsening" day by day. Its spokesperson, however, refused to comment. According to UP State Load Dispatch Centre, the 1,980-MW Lalitpur power plant has already shut one of its super-critical units of 660 MW citing "shortage of coal". The situation is equally bad for NTPC. Records show that UPPCL is yet to pay over Rs 1,400 crore to the company which supplies 3,182 MW of power per day to the state.
 
 Same is the case with NHPC, to which UPPCL is defaulting on a payment of Rs 345 crore. UPPCL also owes Rs 144 crore to Rosa thermal power plant. UP energy minister   said the corporation was suffering from a critical financial problem.
