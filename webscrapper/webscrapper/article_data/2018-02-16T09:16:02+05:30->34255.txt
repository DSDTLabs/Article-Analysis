KOCHI: With fiscal deficit of   increasing over the years, the state government has devised a plan for raising more revenue. The KWA has given its employees a mandate to increase the revenue from each division by 200% in the next one year.

 The KWA authorities have also given instructions to reduce water loss by keeping it to the minimum. “We have asked the employees to ensure generation of revenue which is twice that of the current figure. We have also asked them to collect the arrears on a war-footing,” said A Shainamol, managing director, KWA.
 
 Officials with the KWA are in favour of hiking water charges to increase the revenue. “In 1999, the government had decided that the water charges would be hiked every year. Still, it took nine more years to effect the next hike and that too a nominal one. It was in 2014 that the government effected the latest hike,” said a KWA official. “When compared to hike in charges of other services like electricity, bus etc, the overall increase in the water bills in the past two decades is nominal. So, there should be a judicious hike in the water charges,” he said.
 
 At the same time, water resources minister Mathew T Thomas made it clear that the government would not be hiking water bills.
 
 “It is against the promises in the   manifesto. We would be increasing the revenue by plugging water leak and checking water theft,” the minister said.
 
 “The revenue from each division should be increased by 200%t by collecting the arrears as well as the water bills of the current fiscal properly,” he said.
 
 Minister also said that the KWA would augment its infrastructure for enhancing the capacity.
 
 “The KWA has availed maximum funds from Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board. We got Rs 1,257 crore from  . Of the 23 projects designed using the funds, work on 22 have begun,” he said.
