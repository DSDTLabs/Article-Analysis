 As per Kavita, following are the guidelines for the new mothers practising prenatal yoga:
 
 
 1. During early period of pregnancy upto around 13th week, pregnant women should take it easy as they adjust to changing hormones and energy during an often intense and delicate period of transformation. 
 
 2. This is time for getting more grounded, slowing down a bit, focussing more on the inside and creating a favourable environment for the ovum to grow into a healthy fetus. 
 
 3. Do not jolt, do more of pelvic awareness exercises and add variety of shoulder strengtheners and openers. The fetus is small during first trimester and is well protected inside the pelvis so till first trimester students can lie on their belly.
 
 
 
 1. In the second trimester, with the placenta fully functional, hormone levels balance out and the pregnancy is generally established. This is the perfect time to focus on cultivating strength and stamina, to refine awareness of the pelvis and spine and to build more internal support. 
 
 2. Size of the belly start varying in the second trimester. The pelvis no longer protects the uterus so this is the time to adapt asanas accordingly. 
 
 3. Avoid jarring movements, intense abdominal work like Navasana or Kapalbhati pranayama. 
 
 4. Avoid pressure on the abdomen. It is important to develop a supple belly. 
 
 5. Use pelvic neutrality exercises like Tadasana and Urdhva hastasana to cultivate alignment of spine. 
 
 6. Practice standing asanas to develop and maintain leg strength and open hips and pelvis. 
 
 7. Can explore a variety of hip openers.
 
 
 
 1. Reaching third trimester, continue working on postural alignment to give support to the spine. 
 
 2. Use props like chairs and wall to support your asanas. 
 
 3. Become aware of the numbness or tingling sensation when lying on your back as this may be an indication of excessive pressure on the vena cava. 
 
 4. After 34th week no inversions to be tried at all. 
 
 5. Begin doing birthing visualization and other abducted hip opening positions. 
 
 And moreover rest, eat healthy, be around loved one's, listen to music, read, paint, laugh, pray, love and stay happy!
