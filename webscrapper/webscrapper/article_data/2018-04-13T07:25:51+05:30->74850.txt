 According to the sources, Jaipur airport had 36.3 lakh passengers during 2015-16. Out of the 25% growth there is growth of 15% in the international travellers. 
 
 With the increased passenger load the airport authorities are on the job of making efforts to de-congest the airport especially the boarding gates and arrivals.

 Balhara further said that things like expansion of the terminal 1 will de-congest the airport in the future. “Whenever there is a rush we also open the second boarding gate,” he added. 
 
 Presently 61 flights are operated from Jaipur airport to various destinations. However, the growth in the number of passengers has also gone a bit against the airlines and officials of the airport authorities of India. “In terms of services and other things the ranking of Jaipur airport has gone down. Expectations of people are soaring high. In a scenario where rush is increasing the facilities are certainly shrinking,” said a senior officer.
