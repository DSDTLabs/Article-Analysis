HYDERABAD: A group of 15 Kathmandu-bound passengers from Hyderabad ran into trouble at Delhi’s   early on Saturday morning after the ground staff declared their   as invalid identity proof.

 K Srinivas, along with family members and close friends, boarded an   flight to Kathmandu via Delhi from the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, Shamshabad, late on Friday night. As per schedule, they were supposed to board the connecting flight (AI 213) from the national capital at around 7.40am on Saturday. But Srinivas said the airline operator refused to issue them their boarding passes. 
 
 “They told us that the   card is not a valid ID and that we must either produce a voter card or PAN card to continue our onward journey,” he said. Three of the 15 passengers — one among them an aged traveller — did not have any document other than Aadhaar, he added.
 
 “We were left stumped because we knew otherwise. When the ground staff did not relent, we appealed to them to at least allow the 12 passengers who had other ID proofs, but they did not oblige,” Srinivas said over telephone from Delhi airport.
 
 When TOI enquired with AI officials, it was revealed that even some among them didn’t know what the rulebook said. They put the onus on the immigration officials at Delhi airport for not allowing the passengers to board the flight. “AI staffers did not stop them. It was the immigration desk that had an issue,” said an AI official. Later in the day, the AI official returned with another defence that ‘the Aadhaar is indeed not a valid ID’.
 
 “According to our Hyderabad team, the passengers were warned against travelling with invalid documents. But because they created a ruckus, the AI staffers issued them boarding passes up to Delhi,” the official said. The passengers, predictably, rejected this version.
 
 It was after much drama that AI eventually accommodated the passengers on a Kathmandu flight scheduled for departure from Delhi on April 9.
