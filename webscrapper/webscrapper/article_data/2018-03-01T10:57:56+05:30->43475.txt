MARGAO: With the Curchorem police failing to arrest   even six days after he was booked for the murder Suryakant Dessai, 42, at Xelvon, villagers of Xelvon along with the deceased’s family, laid siege to the Curchorem police station on Wednesday morning demanding for the immediate arrest of Hemant. 
 
 Suryakants’s murder was the fallout of a family feud over the construction of a compound wall. While the deceased’s sister-in-law, Shevanti, was arrested by the police the same day, her son, Hemant, has been on the run ever since. 
  
 The local court will pronounce its order on the anticipatory bail moved by Dessai, on Thursday. 
  
 Curchorem MLA  , who also visited the police station on Wednesday, expressed his solidarity with the deceased’s family. 
  
 He said he would join the villagers in their agitation if the police failed to nab Hemant by Thursday. 
  
 Meanwhile, Shevanti, on being produced before the judicial magistrate first class, Quepem, after her five-day police custody ended on Wednesday, was further remanded to 14-day police custody.
