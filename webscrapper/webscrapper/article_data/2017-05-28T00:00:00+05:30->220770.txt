 shares his morning mantra with us...

 I don’t wake up with negative thoughts. My morning begins with positive self-talk, and thinking about God – makes my belief and faith stronger. Then I think about the things I can improve in my self, my life and my game. Whatever I do, I have to improve 5 per cent every day. That’s my goal. At the end of the year, these would amount to big changes. These small changes, improvements, become new benchmarks of personal growth. 
 
  As my morning ritual, I do some breathing excercies for 5-10 minutes, which calms me and keeps me focused. I live in the now. I don’t focus on yesterday or the past. I believe my today is better than yesterday and more positive. I believe in the power of miracles. I have a book of positive thoughts with me, and I keep writing and making notes. My ground rule is: Believe in yourself. 
 
  Cricket has taught me art of survival. It has shown me how to rise after falling, how to make a comeback, and be a fighter. It has taught me that the beauty of struggle lies in patience. It’s at the daily morning practice, that you learn the most profound lessons. When you play meditatively, it changes your inner core and life too!
