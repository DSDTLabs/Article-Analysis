MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday granted no relief to   in a petition where it claimed rights over a plot adjoining its hospital in Navi Mumbai. It had also challenged a show cause notice from   (NMMC) to vacate two floors that the hospital occupied.

 A bench of Justices Abhay Oka and  , dictating the order in an open court, said petitioner Hiranandani Healthcare “has no semblance of rights over the adjacent plot“. The HC said, “The petitioners cannot claim better rights than the rights conferred by NNMC on the basis of a September 1997 agreement -by which two floors were given to the company to run a superspeciality hospital.“
 
 A plot number 28 was given by CIDCO to NNMC under a 1997 agreement for a hospital. The corporation constructed a five-storied build ing but used only three floors to run a civil hospital on `no loss no profit' basis. It then invited tenders for running a super speciality hospital. Hiranandani Healthcare bid for it and won it. The superspeciality Hiranandani hospital came up there. There was a plot adjacent to Cidco, half of which NMMC agreed to give the company, without permission from Cidco. RTI activist   had filed a PIL in 2005 challenging a lease deed executed between the NNMC and Hiranandani Healthcare for the two floors. The PIL was disposed of last year after the state had last September directed the NMMC to take steps to terminate the January 2006 agreement with the company. Hiranandani challenged the state's order. It also said it was “lawfully put in possession of the adjoining plot in 2006“.
 
 The court also granted liberty to NMMC to take a decision on the show cause notice.
