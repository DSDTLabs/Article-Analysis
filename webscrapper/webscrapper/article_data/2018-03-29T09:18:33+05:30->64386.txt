HYDERABAD: The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader and former chief minister of Jharkhand Hemant Soren on Wednesday said a viable alternative to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) would emerge in the country in time for the 2019 elections. “The BJP is playing dirty politics. It is showing its aggression. This sort of behaviour is intolerable,” he said in an interview with TOI.

 Soren, who is on a visit to Hyderabad, met chief minister   at   along with his family. The Chief Minister's Office said both the leaders “had lunch together and discussed national politics”. Soren arrived in the city on March 26 and will be here till March 30. With his family, he visited Ramoji Film City and also met media baron  . The family also visited Golconda Fort and Salar Jung Museum.
 
 Asked how the federal front idea that KCR proposed would be taken forward, Soren told TOI there is a lot of discontent in the country against the BJP. “There is a need in the country for a coalition against the BJP and it is taking place,” he said in reference to West Bengal chief minister   also talking to various political parties. On the sudden activity that is being seen with leaders of various parties talking about an alternative to the BJP, Soren said it could not be described as ‘sudden’. "The process has been on for sometime," he said.
 
 "There are many political developments taking place in the country today, all of which are bringing different political parties onto a single platform against the BJP," he said.
 
 Soren recalled that KCR was a good friend of his father Shibhu Soren and they shared a strong bond. Asked about the prospects of JMM in 2019 polls, Soren said he was optimistic the results would be in favour of JMM. In 2014 polls, the BJP had wrested power. On   elections due in May, Soren said he was observing developments. Asked if he thought BJP would unseat the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government, he said this was most likely.
