LUCKNOW: The panel of doctors who conducted   examination stated that   died of  , though they could not specify how exactly   stopped all of a sudden in his body. Choking, strangulation, smothering, hanging, seizure, drug overdose, poisoning are some common causes of asphyxia. 

 The collective decision of five doctors, including additional CMO and head of forensic medicine of KGMU to not specify the reason of death has added to mystery surrounding the high profile case as 18-hour long probe failed to conclude whether Tewari's death was natural or unnatural. Forensic experts will be roped in for further direction in the case now.
 
 As all body organs including stomach, mucosa, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, kidney, lungs, heart and brain were found congested, experts said thorough probe is required now to find out whether Tewari died of external or internal poisoning. "It appears Tewari was feeling uneasy in his room and rushed out for fresh air. He was not feeling okay and it needs to be checked if he was on medication and some drug caused a reaction or he died of external poisoning or if somebody visited him in the guest house," said head of forensic medicine department at a private university Dr Abhas Kumar Singh.
 
 There were six injuries noted, including on Tewari's lower lip, two lacerated wounds on chin, contusion on left wrist, injury on right knee and bruise near left side of the mouth. None of the injuries was fatal, said the panel of doctors.
 
 Not taking any chances, doctors have preserved Tewari's heart for histopathology examination. Forensic experts will study the changes caused in the heart to deduce what led to asphyxia. Other body organs too have been preserved. SSP Deepak Kumar said Tewari's belongings will be checked. "We will see if he was on any drugs and we will also check if apart from LDA vice chairman P N Singh, anybody else visited the room," said Kumar.
