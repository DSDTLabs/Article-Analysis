Erode: Villagers of Gobipalayam and Bodichinnampalayam staged a road blockade on Monday, demanding regular supply of potable water. The protesters, who squatted on Erode-Mysuru National Highway near Gobipalayam, alleged that they hadn’t received potable water supply for the past six months.

 Traffic on the stretch was disrupted for two hours due to the road blockade.
 
 “We have been struggling without drinking water,” said M Amutha, a villager. According to her, the villagers had to travel at least 5km to fetch potable water.
 
 The villagers said most of them had to take leave from work to go outside to fetch water.
 
 The protesters also wanted Alukkuli panchayat officials to set up at least 10 borewells in the two villages to end the water crisis. Presently, there are a few borewells, but they are in a pathetic condition. They may go dry at any time,” one of the protesters said.
 
 As the traffic came to a halt, Gobichettipalayam police and Alukkuli panchayat officials rushed to the spot and held peace talks with the protesters. The officials assured the villagers that they would take necessary steps to find a solution to the issue at the earliest. Following this, the protestors dispersed.
