NEW DELHI: Two days after filing a corruption case against   CEO  , the   summoned him to India and asked him to appear before it on June 6.

 
 Top sources told TOI that a notice for appearance had been sent to Fernandes in   via email.
 
 Fernandes, sources said, needed to be questioned regarding the   (FIPB) approval taken by the company for investing in India and his alleged efforts to get the ‘5/20’ rule of civil aviation policy changed so that AirAsia could start international operations. He is also accused of pressurising former AirAsia India CEO Mittu Chandilya to pursue changes in regulatory policies for international aviation in India suitable to the company.
 
 Officials refused to say whether Fernandes had replied to the CBI’s summons yet. The agency is also likely to soon issue summons to Malaysia-based deputy group CEO of AirAsia Bo Lingam and AirAsia India director Venkatramanan Ramchandran. FIPB and civil aviation ministry officials, who handled the AirAsia file in 2013-14, will also be called to CBI headquarters for questioning.
 
 The agency has alleged that AirAsia used lobbyists, such as  , to get the ‘5/20’ rule removed or amended before the 2014 general elections. Under the ‘5/20’ scheme, a domestic airline was allowed to fly overseas only after completing five years of domestic operations with a fleet of at least 20 aircraft. “Tony Fernandes wanted the airline to be able to fly internationally and its local Indian partner — Tata Sons through their nominee R Venkatramanan — would lobby to get all government approvals including the then FIPB clearance and amendment/removal of ‘5/20’ rule of Indian international civil aviation,” the CBI said.
