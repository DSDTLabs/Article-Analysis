VASCO: BJP   Milind Naik’s victory was overshadowed by the sudden death of his younger brother Sagun Naik, 47, due to cardiac arrest, on Saturday.

 Sagun complained of chest pain during the victory rally taken out by the Mormugao MLA’s supporters. He was rushed to a private hospital in an unconscious state, where he breathed his last while undergoing treatment.
 
 The body was taken to the Naik’s ancestral home at Sada. The last rites were conducted at 8pm.
 
 The constituency, which should have been celebrating its MLA’s third win, was shrouded in silence.
