CHANDIGARH: Silver worth Rs 3 lakh was stolen from a temple in Sector 24 here on Sunday night.

 Police suspect the theft, which took place between 12.30am and 1.45am, to be an inside job and have started investigations. The stolen valuables include a silver sheet weighing 6kg, three silver crowns (each weighing 1.5kg), and idols made of brass.
 
 According to the president of Shiv Temple’s trust,  , the theft came to light around 2.30am, when a devotee reached the temple to pay obeisance and found locks of three rooms broken. The SHO of Sector 11 police station,  , who inspected the crime scene along with DSP (central)  , said an examination of the footage of the 16 CCTV cameras installed at the temple showed that five men entered the temple at 12.30am and left around 1.45am. “We suspect it to be an inside job because the cash box had been emptied two days ago. The thieves probably did not touch it because they knew it would have nothing,” said the SHO.
 
 For now, police have registered a case of theft and trespass against unknown persons. At the time of the theft, two helpers were sleeping on the premises of the temple, but they did not hear anything.
 
 Hari said the thieves broke the locks of eight rooms of the temple. A forensics team and a dog squad were also called in to collect evidence from the crime scene, said the SHO.
