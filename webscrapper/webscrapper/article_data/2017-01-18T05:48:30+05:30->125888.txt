New Delhi: Following a circular by   to private schools in the city to not follow the   circular on appointment of principals, the examination body has clarified that it had held the said circular in abeyance a few days ago. 

 In December, CBSE had notified private schools affiliated to it that they will not be able to appoint principals on their own as the board has empowered itself to monitor such appointments in schools that fall under its ambit. However, the education department, in a circular dated January 13, told schools that the CBSE notification cannot be followed because the new clauses are contrary to the provisions of   Rules.
 
 The board has now clarified that there is no contradiction between their decisions.
