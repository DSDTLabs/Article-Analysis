HYDERABAD: When party-addict Tarun was called for questioning by the   (SIT) in connection with the drugs case, not many eyebrows were raised. The actor with a 'lover boy' image had made no bones of his love for partying and had even opened a pub in 2009. That is not to conclude his involvement in the drugs case, but sitting in front of a team of investigating officials to be grilled was not something his family had imagined.

 When he was only eight years old, Tarun got into films. As a child actor, for his performance in the film 'Anjali' directed by Mani Ratnam, he got the National Best Child Actor award, with two other child artistes.
 
 Getting into films was a natural choice for Tarun as his mother   too had faced the camera for the first time when she was only five years old. She acted in no less than 300 films in Telugu, Tamil,   and Kannada. Tarun's fat her Chakrapani too was an Oriya actor and on Saturday accompanied his son to the SIT office at Nampally, where the actor was questioned.
 
 A fine cricketer, Tarun metamorphosed from a child artiste into a big league actor. The film 'Nuvve Kavali' directed by   with   in the lead sent a signal to the industry: a loverboy had arrived. sBut this image haunted him as it was believed that he was involved in an affair with an actress who is no more.
 
 Later, Tarun faced the dead end. In fact, after 2014, he has not had a release so far. His next film is supposed to be ready, but has not hit the theatres yet.
 
 With a number of newcomers making their way into the film industry, especially those from established film families, there have been fewer film offers coming his way.
 
 When his name cropped up in connection with the drugs case, Tarun had issued a statement making it clear that he was not involved in it but would appear before SIT for questioning.
