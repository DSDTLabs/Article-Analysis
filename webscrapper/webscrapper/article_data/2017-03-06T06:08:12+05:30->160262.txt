AHMEDABAD: It was both an occasion to cry and laugh for hundreds of   fans when their friends and family met at   on Sunday morning to pay   who passed away on March 1. Termed ‘Hasyanjali’ where white clothes were not required and nobody was allowed to keep a straight face, was attended by people from across Gujarat.

  In his remembrance the family had decided to put the signature hat and ‘ooltah chashma’ of the author near his photograph.
 
 A simlar homage has been planned on Monday at Mumbai where members of Gujarati community and the TV fraternity are expected to join.
 
  
  
 Eshani Shah, Mehta’s daughter, said that she perhaps didn’t realize how popular her father was while in the US. “For past few days, we have been getting constant flow of condolences and glowing tributes for him - which was made possible only because of the readers’ love for past five decades. He was a man with golden heart who laughed off difficulties and always gave humour in return,” she said.
 
 A few of the actors appearing in ‘Tarak Mehta ka Ooltah Chashmah’ participated in the event along with producer Asit Modi. Shyam Pathak, who plays character of Popatlal in the long-running serial, said that he considered himself lucky to be associated with his works. “However, as many messages on social media lamented, he passed away without seeing Popatlal’s wife,” said Pathak.
 
 The speakers also remembered Mehta’s layered universe of characters in Mumbai which entertained the readers every week for over 45 years. A number of old staffers or the magazine where Mehta’s work used to get published also shared their experiences, throwing light on different facets of his life and times.
