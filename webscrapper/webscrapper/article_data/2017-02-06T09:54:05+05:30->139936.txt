KOHIMA: The state-wide bandh was fully relaxed by protesters on Sunday in Christian-majority Nagaland. All churches held special prayer meetings for the return of normalcy to the state. A partial bandh will, however, resume on Monday, the   (NTAC) said. 

 The NTAC issued a warning against opening government offices and vehicles plying the roads, seeking support from government servants and the people to extend their "cooperation" to the ongoing "people's movement".
 
 The   (AYO), too, said the partial bandh will continue in Kohima and Dimapur. The Eastern Nagaland Peoples' Organization (ENPO) said it has decided to "restrict opening of government offices and movement of government vehicles" till the demands of the NTAC and the   (JCC) are met. It has also said it will "extend support to and is in total solidarity with" the resolutions adopted by the NTAC and JCC.
 
 The state continues to be cut off, with mobile, internet and SMS services disrupted since January 30, when the state government said it did so to avoid rumour-mongering in view of the protests against the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) election in the state.
 
 In view of the prevailing tension, Kohima DC and district magistrate   has imposed Section 144 Cr PC in four colonies - Old Ministers' Hill, Jail Colony, Police Headquarters Junction and Raj Bhavan - starting 9.30pm on February 2 till further notice.
 
 Security has been tightened in and around the Nagaland Civil Secretariat, DC office Kohima and Nagaland Commissioner, with armed personnel from Nagaland Police, IRBn and Assam Rifles standing guard and barbed wire already put on the road that lead to the offices.
