NEW DELHI: Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president  , in a   on Wednesday, claimed that it was a   to   the   appointed by the   to Delhi government.

 Maken stated that “AAP was hand-in-glove with the BJP government at the Centre” to remove the advisers in a “pick-and-choose manner”.
 
 “The Shunglu Committee, in its report submitted to the LG on November 28, found grave irregularities in the appointment of 71 AAP members in Delhi government. AAP wants to gain sympathy votes as some of the advisers who have been removed, like Raghav Chadha and Atishi Marlena, were reportedly being considered for the next general elections,” Maken said.
 
 Slamming the Centre, Maken said that even though the Shunglu panel report was submitted to the LG last year, it took five months for the Union home ministry to act on it. 
 
 Maken stated that Marlena was   as adviser to the deputy CM for a token salary of Re 1 per month, while the case of Raghav Chadha, adviser to minister (finance), was termed as a “closed chapter” by the Shunglu Committee report as he was in the position for only two and a half months.
 
 “Health minister Satyendar Jain’s daughter Soumya Jain was appointed as adviser to mission director, Delhi State Health Mission, even though she is an architect by profession. The Shunglu Committee report had found irregularities in her appointment, but she has not been removed by the Centre,” added Maken.
