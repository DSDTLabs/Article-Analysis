The movie   was quite a hit. Now there is also a serial, in the same name. But the story has got nothing to do with the movie. The serial, launching on May 29, revolves around two characters —  , a kind-hearted and a soft-spoken maid, and  , the son of a rich family, where   works. 

 A source tells us, “The plot focuses on the love story between Karthi and Chemba, who get married to each other under certain circumstances. Their relationship goes through several ups and downs. How Chemba overcomes the hurdles (like trying to establish herself as a suitable daughter-in-law of the house) in her life is the story.”
 
 “The serial has several sub-plots, which involve the sons and daughters of the house trying to break the family. How the lead pair offer resistance and bind the family together is also another aspect of the story,” adds the source. 
 
 The lead role is played by   of   100o fame and the female lead is played by actress   of Julieum 4 Perum fame. The serial is directed by Praveen Bennet, who also directed the popular Saravanan Meenatchi.
