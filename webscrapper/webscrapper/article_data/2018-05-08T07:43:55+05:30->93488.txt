CHANDIGARH: A day after all-India National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test ( ), the entrance test for admission to MBBS and BDS courses, was conducted, experts on Monday pointed out eight ambiguous questions from physics, chemistry and biology sections that they said seemed to be erroneous.

 
 
  
 
 While some questions had two correct answers, there was not even a single correct answer out of the four options in a few cases. Experts said there were three such questions in chemistry, three in biology and two in physics. The experts, who have been training students for more than a decade, have also written to the   for clarification.
 
 Ananya Ganguly, a chemistry expert, said, “If not corrected or cancelled, these questions will have an impact on the result. It is quite disappointing that errors are found even when the CBSE gets a full year to prepare the paper.”
 
 Dr Arvind Goyal, a biology trainer, said, “The CBSE should take these erroneous questions seriously as even a single question is important in a competitive examination of this level. With nearly 13 lakh candidates who registered for NEET the competition is expected to be very tough. Taking corrective steps at this stage will prevent any unjustified loss of marks to the deserving candidates.”
 
 Kunal Singh, a physics expert, said, “One question is ambiguous. A thermodynamics question is invalid with the given data. Four other questions are there where CBSE must have written to find approximate answer because assumptions were not given. If you look at JEE advanced paper, IITs always mentions the necessary assumption to be taken because values of some quantities vary from place to place.
