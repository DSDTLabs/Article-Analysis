Ahmedabad: The installation of CCTV cameras at Bedia village in Gir-Somnath district has brought about a big change in the perception that the presence of the lion is harmful for cattle. A study for two years, aided by the CCTV cameras, revealed that 70% of the kill in the area was by wild boar and neelgai.

 “To clear the misconception among the villagers, we decided to show them the CCTV footage which established that the lion came to the village for domestic cattle, only when there was no wild boar or neelgai near the fields,” said Dr Jalapan Rupapara. Rupapara said that this has brought about a change in the perception of the people and now they allow the lion to make a kill which is once in a week. Rupapara said that with the installation of the CCTV cameras, incidents of theft in the village too have gone down. “We were also able to make the villagers believe that the presence of the lion was beneficial for the villagers as it would keep wild boars and other wild animals away from the field,” he said.
