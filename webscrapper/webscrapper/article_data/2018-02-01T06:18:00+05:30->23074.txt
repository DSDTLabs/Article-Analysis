Though the scientist community is mostly content with funding from the central government, it is hoping that the Union Budget on Thursday brings in more cheers to the research and development field.

 Amit Majumdar, former regional director of Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research, said, “The government’s focus is very clear and our mandate is pretty much chalked out. I am confident that the budget will reflect this government’s commitment to the scientific community.” 
 
 He added that the steady funding has ensured that India is on its way to securing almost 400 years of nuclear energy resources. “Our nuclear power project is unique in the world because we are using thorium. The government is well aware that we are now on the threshold of surging ahead in technology and ultimately starting commercial use of nuclear energy. Once we achieve that, it will mean centuries of secured power for our country and this is something this government will definitely consider in its budgetary allocation,” said Majumdar.
 
 JS Pandey, chief scientist and science secretary at Neeri, said, “I think the government will continue its focus on science and its benefits to society at large. There is an overall view in the government that research and development must have societal benefits. Whatever technology you are inventing or researching must have social applications. I am sure the budget will be oriented in such a way that ultimate benefits of all scientific allocation reach the common man.” 
 
 Arun Chaturvedi, former director of National Bureau of Soil Survey, agreed that the focus should be to push agriculture extensions. “What's missing is the impact of what we in the scientific community call ‘lab to land’ initiatives. I believe this has to be emphasized much more now through new scheme announcements. Because we have limited land and the land quality is also not the best always, so focus has to be on diversification. It's like you give land to tribals for rehabilitation but we have to also see that what quality of land we are giving them,” said Chaturvedi.
 
 Experts like PD Majumdar, former adviser to ISRO and DST, believe the space research segment is still placed comfortably in the budgetary priority. “Generally the funding from central government has been good and I can say that even for the various fields in the scientific community. ISRO has been very well supported by the government and as a result you see that we are making various forays into space research and technology. We are helping foreign countries send their satellites into orbit.” 
 
 Majumdar advised caution while funding certain projects. “The government must be careful when deciding on funding to certain projects or initiatives because there have been cases of a few of them being stopped midway. Even for established institutes, certain laboratories are closing down so funding for them should also be done after due diligence,” said Majumdar. 
 
 EXPECTATIONS
 
 * Budget should be focused on scientific initiatives that have societal benefits
 
 * Diversification within any field of research should be encouraged
 
 * Nuclear power research funding should be steady to help our energy needs
 
 * Fund allocation for certain faltering initiatives must be reviewed
