PATNA: The city is going to lose a major landmark as the   is being razed for the purpose of construction of the   flyover.

 A big statue of Veer Kunwar Singh at the roundabout will, however, be salvaged and is proposed to be raised to the level of the flyover circle at the same spot. The statue was unveiled by the governor of Bihar in 1983. 
 
 The R-Bolck flyover connects Mithapur ROB to Bhikhari Thakur ROB (near Vidhan Sabha) over Hardinge Road via   roundabout. One flank of the flyover lands on Beer Chand Patel Marg. The deadline for completion of works on the flyover is November next year.
 
 “We are razing the R-Block roundabout for construction of the flyover, but the statue of Veer Kunwar Singh will be saved. We will cover the statue as of now and a request has been made to the state government to raise it up to the level of the circle of the flyover,” said a Bihar   engineer deputed on the site.
 
 He added around 60% of the foundation level work had already been completed. “Of the 67 pillars, work is underway on 30 pillars. Work will soon start on construction of spans of the flyover,” the engineer said.
 
 The flyover is being constructed using cast-in- situ technology in which the entire construction is done on the site. A couple of flyovers in the city, including Jagdeopath-Sheikhpura Mor and Exhibition Road flyovers, on the other hand, have been developed using pre-cast technology under which the slabs are constructed at another place and affixed on the pillars later on.
 
 Since pre-cast technology is not being used in the construction of this flyover, there is no provision of underground parking, considering the paucity of space underneath the flyover.
 
 “Either there could have been service lane or parking space as there is very little space left on the ground after the construction of the flyover. Hence, there is no provision of underground parking as of now,” said the engineer.
