 Already handicapped by the absence of the dazzling South African duo of Quinton de Kock and JP Duminy, Delhi are also set to lose another couple of Proteas stars in Kagiso Rabada and Chris Morris as well as England wicketkeeper-batsman Sam Billings to international duty in the latter stages of the season. Sri Lankan allrounder Angelo Mathews, currently nursing a hamstring injury, is another big name who could miss the start. On the bright side, Indian pacer Mohammed Shami has fully recovered from the knee injury.
 
 
 A good T20 side can never be complete without the presence of allrounders and this is one department where Delhi aren't lacking in numbers. The acquisitions of Corey Anderson and Angelo Mathews should in some way compensate for the loss of Duminy at least, while powerful West Indian Carlos Brathwaite's exploits are well known. Expect Pat Cummins and Kagiso Rabada to rattle opposition batsmen with raw pace.
 
 
 Like Mumbai, Delhi too have struggled to start well, especially in recent seasons. Unlike Mumbai, though, they have lacked the ability to bounce back.
