 School students from Gurgaon and Delhi come here on weekends to paint the walls of the park with some butterfly-themed artwork. 
  morning, two students – Varini from DPS, Sector 45 and Shubhi from   – reached the park to paint a section of the wall. “We are painting a giant butterfly in the cubism style, using warm colours for the butterfly and cool colours for the exterior,” said Varini. The two friends said they heard about the park from acquaintances and got to know they were encouraging residents to get involved, which is how they decided to volunteer at the park. “We just want to do our bit and make the park more beautiful,” Shubhi added. Over the last few weeks, several school groups and even residents from the city have come and painted over half a dozen paintings on the walls of the park. The park administration is also running other resident engagement activities at the park currently. “We encourage people to come to the park on their birthdays and plant a sapling in their name. Your name would be visible on a plaque next to the plant. It is basically a way to get residents involved with the park and make them feel some ownership,” says Sanjay Kaushik.
