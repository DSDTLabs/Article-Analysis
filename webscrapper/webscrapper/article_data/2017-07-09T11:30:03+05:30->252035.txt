Actor and director   has just completed shooting for the film titled  . Ask him about the significance of the title, he says, “It's the birthday of   Rajinikanth. I am a big fan of Rajini sir and the movie, too, is about four Rajini fans. For a Rajini fan, every day is Superstar's birthday .“

 Emphasising that the movie has nothing to do with any autobiographical elements, Selvaah, says, “It's a comedy entertainer, starring  , Thambi Ramaiah, Yogi Babu, MS Bhaskar and John Vijay among others. The film is 72% comedy and 28% GST,“ he says, adding, “GST stands for gangster, stunt and thriller.“
 
 He adds, “The movie is a salute to Superstar. Four hardcore Rajini fans get into certain situations and how they come out of it makes the plot.“
 
 Though Selvaah has been acting in films, it has been two decades since he directed a film and with this movie, he is wielding the megaphone again.“My last release was Atharvaa-starrer Eetti. In 12-12-1950, I play a kung fu master and my character name is Kabali Selva. I have also decided to change my name to Kabalai Selva henceforth, since I think that's the best character Rajini sir has ever played so far.“
 
 While actor Thambi Ramaiah will be seen in nine looks in the film, the four-member Rajini fans in the movie have names -Muthu, Baasha, Billa and Ejamaan -referring to the Superstar's movie titles. “The storythread has been in my mind for the past 10 to 12 years. But I decided to make it into a film last year. I met Rajini sir on March 3 and took his blessings. We started the shooting in March itself and completed the movie in a single schedule,“ he says.
 
 So, does the movie throw light on Rajini's political entry or will it talk about his fans' aspirations? “No, Rajini sir met his fans only in May and by that time, the film was almost ready . However, there will be a single line mention about his proposed political entry and I want the audience to listen to it only in theatres,“ he says.
