PATNA: Amid reports of continuing turbulence in Bihar’s ruling coalition, alliance partner   has now sought party vice-president Rahul Gandhi’s ‘margdarshan’ on how to handle the situation.

 Congress MLA Shakeel Ahmad Khan, who is also the AICC secretary, wrote a letter to Rahul in this regard on Thursday. “I have sought his ‘margdarshan’ on what is our stand in today’s situation? We should be in position to answer this question with proper substance,” Shakeel told TOI.
 
 He has also urged Rahul to convene a meeting of the party’s legislators and discuss with them the state’s political situation before the assembly’s monsoon session begins.
 
 “We know our party’s stand on issues like corruption, economic situation, job crisis, lynching and violence. However, we are not clear on what we have to say about the ongoing crisis in GA,” he told this reporter.
 
 Referring to the 2019 general election, Shakeel said the Congress would need both RJD boss Lalu Prasad and CM Nitish Kumar to take on the BJP effectively. “Hamein Nitish bhi chahiye aur Lalu bhi. The three parties should sit together and sort out our internal issues,” he added.
