AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad   of police   has begun the process to sack a   from service after he was arrested on   a 13-year-old girl.

 The 45-year-old accused raped the girl, his neighbour, on Wednesday and was arrested on late Thursday. He was produced before the court on Friday that remanded him in police custody till Monday.
 
 The accused has been slapped with stringent sections of Protection of Children from Sexual offences Act, apart from Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Primary investigation into the case has found that the accused, in an attempt to gain proximity to her, had even gifted a mobile phone to the victim.
 
 Taking cognizance of the incident, Singh has initiated the process of removing the accused from the service. Singh told TOI, “Considering the gravity of the issue, we have been compelled to take action under Section 311 (2) B of the Indian constitution, where authority is empowered to dismiss or remove a person from service.”
 
 The officer said though the process has been initiated, some technical glitches are causing the delay for sanctioning the orders. On Wednesday, the accused had reached out to the minor’s father and asked him to go to the highway passing and look for a vehicle with a particular number.
 
 After sending the victim’s father, the accused took the girl to a deserted place where he raped her and threatened her with dire consequences. 
 
 After waiting for the vehicle, which never arrived, victim’s father returned from the highway after a couple of hours, following which the minor girl narrated her ordeal.
