AMRITSAR: A woman professor of Guru   (GNDU) has approached the  , seeking religious action against   vice-chancellor Jaspal Singh Sandhu. 

 Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Prof Gurpreet Kaur of the GNDU music department alleged that Sandhu had been intimidating her after she refused to bow to his dictates or take his unwarranted orders. Gurpreet had joined GNDU on July 2011 and besides being professor, she had held several other posts, including that of dean, chairperson, member of senate and syndicate. 
 
 "I had dared to complain against Sandhu earlier and as a result I was stripped off all my posts," she alleged.
 
 Levelling serious charges of harassment against the VC in a complaint submitted to jathedar of Akal Takht, she said that she wanted Sikh clerics to take action against Sandhu as they had taken in case of controversial former SAD minister Sucha Singh Langah and ex-president of CKD Charanjit Singh Chadha.
 
 Sandhu, who is former chairman of the  , said that, "The matter is sub-judice, I don't want to give any comment."
