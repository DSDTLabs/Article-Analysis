It's just been a few days since the romantic song from   - Namitha Pramod starrer ' ,' 'Njano raavo irulu neendi vannu' got released on social media platforms. 

  The song had gone viral in no time, but it also looks like it is also garnering some negative attention, of late.
 
 Netizens point out that the song, sung by Divya S Menon and Haricharan and penned by Rafeeq Ahamed, is strikingly similar to the song 'Sairat Salaji' from the hit Marathi movie 'Sairat,' which had won critical acclaim at the national level, winning many awards. The film's music was by Ajay - Atul, who has won the Best Music Direction award too in the 2008 National Film Awards for the Marathi film 'Jogwa.'
 
 Meanwhile, we reached out to Gopi Sunder and he says, "This is an accusation that I am used to now and I don't give it undue importance. While checking out any piece of creation, if you want to, you can find similarities with another. I have been working in this industry for the past 23 years and so I am aware of all such turn of events. As you say in Malayalam, 'Maanga Ulla Maavile Kalleriyu (It's only the fruitful mango tree that gets pelted with stones).' It's when one of my songs become a hit that now people feel the need to go after anything that has a similarity to it, and come up with such comments. I look at it all positively." The State Award winner music director adds that the song is not a raga-based composition, and he has given prominence to the particular emotion that laces the scenes, to direct its music. 
 
 'Kammara Sambhavam' directed by Rathish Ambat will be in theaters on April 14
