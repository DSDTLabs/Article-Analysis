KOLKATA: Solar power will soon light up  , the Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation’s headquarters in  . It will help the civic body to save several lakhs annually in the form of electricity bills.

 “It will be calculated how much electricity the solar panels would need to generate to light up the entire G+6 building,” said corporation mayor Sabyasachi Dutta.
 
  
 According to Salt Lake civic officials, the building has a large open space on the roof, which is ideal for installation of solar panels. Besides, there is space around the main building where the panels could be installed. The decision on where the panels will be set up is yet to be taken.
 
 The initiative to turn Poura Bhavan green is a part of the larger plan to shift all streetlights in Salt Lake from sodium vapour to LED lights. According to figures, there are about 24,000 streetlight posts across Salt Lake and adjacent places.
 
 Rough estimates show the civic authorities pay a montly electricity bill of around Rs 1.5 crore. Once all the sodium vapour lamps are replaced with LED lights, about 60% of the current bills will be reduced.
 
 A total of 351 old sodium vapour lamps were recently removed from the stretches of Broadway and Metro corridor near   and the civic authorities have decided that these old lamps will be equally distributed from ward 1 to ward 27 as a temporary arrangement.
 
 A control room will be set up at Poura Bhavan and each LED lighting installation will have a sensor chip device, along with a timer fixed with it. The civic body will be able to keep track of all the lights through the sensor-based chip that will send out a signal to the control room in case of a technical glitch.
