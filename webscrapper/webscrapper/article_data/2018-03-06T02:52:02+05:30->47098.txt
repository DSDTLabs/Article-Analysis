MUMBAI: Hoardings can be permitted as long as they do not pose a threat to the public, the Bombay high court ruled, while ordering the removal of hoardings put up outside   beach without the permission of the  . 

 A division bench of justices   and Bharati Dangre gave the advertiser seven days to remove the hoardings that had come up on land belonging to the Airport Authority of India.
 
 "Hoardings which may distract and pose a danger to free flow of traffic need to be regulated...since the safety of public at large should be the primary goal," said the judges.
 
 The court said the claims of an authority about entering into a commercial venture cannot override public interest. "Erection of hoardings can be permitted subject to regulation as long as they do not endanger public safety," the bench said.
 
 The court was hearing a public interest litigation filed by local residents as well as a plea filed by a five-star hotel which had claimed hoardings were obstructing free flow of light and air into its premises. The PILs claimed the hoardings were a traffic hazard and also obstructed the view of Juhu beach for the public.
 
 The advertiser claimed the 11 hoardings were put up pursuant to a tender by the AAI. Since the hoardings were on AAI land, BMC approvals were not needed. The court did not agree and cited the corporation's policy for regulating hoardings. The court also took into account the fact that permission of the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority was needed since the plot was in Coastal Regulation Zone II. The court asked the authorities to consider whether the hoardings also fell foul of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act in view of allegations that they were obstructing the view of the statues of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Mahatma Gandhi near the beach.
