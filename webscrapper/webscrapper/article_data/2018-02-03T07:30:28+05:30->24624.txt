AHMEDABAD: A   — Mukesh Patel, eminent tax guru; Bakul Dholakia, former director of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A); and Jay Narayan Vyas, economist and former minister in Gujarat government — hailed the focus of   2018 on   and senior citizens at a panel discussion organized at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) on Friday.

  
  Terming the budget as one of the ‘outstanding budgets’ for senior citizens, Patel said, “It has proposed higher deductions for medical insurance/treatment and bank deposit interest. The basic income tax exemption limit fora senior citizen is Rs 3 lakh plus Rs. 1.50 lakh deduction under section 80C. They are also allowed deduction of Rs 40,000 from their pension income. Now, the deduction limits increased to Rs 50,000 each for health insurance premium and interest income from bank deposits, senior citizens can effectively plan income of Rs 5.90 lakh with zero income tax.”
 
 He also said that the government should have provided tangible and meaningful relief to salaried taxpayers. “They (salaried taxpayers) contribute three times the tax paid by individual business taxpayers deriving income from business and industry. Moreover, 60% of personal income tax collection comes from the salaried class and therefore, they should have been given something tangible,” he added.
 
 Bakul Dholakia appreciated the government’s focus on healthcare but was critical of the lack of focus on exports. “Currently, India’s export growth is at 12% while imports are growing at 21%. This is will widen the trade deficit,” he said. 
 
 “One must understand that if the personal disposable income of farmers and those in agriculture and rural arenas increases, industries will indirectly benefit,” Jay Narayan Vyas said.
