CHENNAI: If the   of   is to be believed, collecting data through Right to Information (RTI) Act petitions is the purview of the police department.

 This was part of a half-page essay received by RTI applicant Balaji Premkumar in December. Balaji had filed an RTI to access copies of temporary, permanent and contracted staff, doctors and their roles and responsibilities at the Stanley Medical College.
 
 RTI activists say this is yet another instance of government departments denying information under RTI. “On other occasions, RTI petitioners have been asked to come in person or been demanded identity cards just to intimidate them. Saying that staff data can be accessed only by police is a new reply,” said  , co-covenor of transparency NGO Arapor Iyakkam, which uses RTI to highlight civic issues in Chennai.
 
 Sources in the government establishment said replies to RTI were being used by activists as evidence in litigation and embarrassing the government, which is why officials are reluctant to share information.
 
 For instance, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (CMWSSB) provided data on the quantity of debris dumped into the Villivakkam lake to the same RTI applicant Balaji. However, on the data, they had affixed a seal stating that the data was ‘not valid for legal purpose’.
 
 Former chief information commissioner   said affixing such a seal was absurd. “The RTI document is a government record. It is an evidence, whether courts use it or not is up to them,” he said.
