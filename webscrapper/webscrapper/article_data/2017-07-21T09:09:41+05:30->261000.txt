 Growing up in Moga (Punjab), Harmanpreet had no option but to play with the boys in her neighbourhood as not many girls took up to sports. This was a blessing in disguise since she became a lot tougher than what she was earlier. Her father -   - is a lawyer's clerk in the district court. He feels that his daughter is better than most boys. "We have seen many hardships. I wanted her to be a sportsperson but could not because of financial constraints. My daughter is fulfilling my dreams now," a proud Bhullar told TOI.
 
 "She has brought our small city (Moga) on the national map with her outstanding performances. I hope she continues her good showing in the future too. She is better than any boy," he added.
 
 Knowing the ins and outs of Harmanpreet's game is her coach  , who believes that in due course of time she will earn more laurels for the country.
