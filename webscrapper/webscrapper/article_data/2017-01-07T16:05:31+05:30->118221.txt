DHANBAD: The   (DTO) in the   finally went   after it received five point of sale (PoS) machines on Friday. DC A Dodde, who inaugurated the cashless transactions, said this is the first step to make the district administration cash free. 

 More PoS machines are expected to arrive to help all the departments go cashless. However, Dodde said, cashless doesn't mean that cash will not be accepted but cash exchange will be discouraged and payments through alternative channels will be encouraged.
 
 Dodde said to turn all the blocks in the district cashless is the topmost priority of the administration. However, disbursal of PoS machines from banks is being done at a very slow pace. 
 
 In the first phase, two panchayats of Dhanbad block will also be made cashless once the PoS machines are provided, he added.
 
 Over a thousand applications for PoS machines have been submitted to different public sectors and private banks in the last one month and due to this sudden surge in demand, banks are facing difficulty in meeting it. 
 
 Dhanbad rail division is also waiting for at least 19 PoS machines. Dhanbad Chamber of Commerce has also applied for 550 PoS machines with different banks and are waiting for their disbursal.
