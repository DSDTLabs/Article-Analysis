Krishnagiri: Three persons, one of them a four-month-old baby girl, were killed and two others critically injured after the car they were travelling in crashed into a truck parked on roadside near Hosur here on the early hours of Wednesday.

 The deceased were identified as K Srinivasan, 58, of Kalpakkam near Chennai and his newborn granddaughter S Yashasvi and car driver V Sureshkumar, 50, of Kalpakkam. Srinivasan’s wife Lalitha, 50, and daughter Swathisri, 24, were injured in the accident.
 
 Srinivasan, police said, was employed with the nuclear power plant at Kalpakkam. According to an investigation officer, Swathisri, a software engineer with a private company in Bengaluru, had come to her parents’ house at Kalpakkam for delivery and she given birth to a baby girl four months ago.
 
 Swathisri, the officer said, was married to S Srinivasan, 28, of Bengaluru. On Wednesday, Swathisri, her newborn child and parents left for Bengaluru in a car with Sureshkumar at the wheel.
 
 When they neared Sipcot near Hosur, the driver lost control over the vehicle, which crashed into a parked truck from behind. Sureshkumar and Srinivasan died on the spot, while Lalitha, Swathisri and the baby girl sustained critical injuries.
 
 Passersby immediately alerted the Sipcot police, who sent the injured to the Hosur government hospital. “But the baby girl succumbed to her injuries on the way to the hospital,” the officer said.
 
 Lalitha and Swathisri were later shifted to a private hospital in Bengaluru, where their condition is said to be stable.
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that the car driver did not notice the truck that was parked on the roadside on Bengaluru-Chennai National Highway.
 
 The Sipcot police have registered a case and further investigation is on.
