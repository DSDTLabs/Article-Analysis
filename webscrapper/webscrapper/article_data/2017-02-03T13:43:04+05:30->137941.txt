 is one of the most anticipated movies in Mollywood and the team has now wrapped up the shooting. The film's protagonists -   and   - both commented on what a memorable experience it has shooting for the movie.

 Prithviraj has posted on his social networking page, "As I walk away from the sets of #TIYAAN for one last time..I wonder if it'll be me saying bye to the sets..or   bidding adieu to me. Few characters can stake claim to influencing the actor at a level that is deeper than the self, inner than the conscience. Aslan will have taught me a lot..lessons that I'm sure are left to be discovered in my life henceforth. It has been a privilege to lend form to what I believe is one of the most complex characters ever written for me, in what is undoubtedly one of Malayalam's biggest ever productions."
 
 Meanwhile, Indrajith wrote, "Prithvi and me have combined ourselves together in so many movies, but trust me.. there was something really really special about this one, thanks to our characters n the way they have been penned! And for all those of you, who have showered me with constant love n support all thru these yrs, watch out for ' ', my toughest assignment till date."
