The film weaves together three stories set in a Mumbai chawl.While the first narrative involves a businessman looking for accommodation in Mumbai who eventually zeroes in on a house that’s overpriced, the second one revolves around a wife dealing with an abusive and alcoholic husband.The third story narrates the tale of forbidden love --- where a Hindu girl and a Muslim boy fall for each other.    Debutant director Arjun Mukerjee’s 3 Storeys attempts to shatter the perception that the inhabitants of a regular Mumbai chawl live seemingly staid lives. Each story ends with a delicious twist, throwing light on human frailties and also lays bare the circumstances, which often go against human wishes and desires. In fact, the screenplay doesn’t shy away from making the point that life can’t be viewed through rose-tinted glasses and reality is often a bitter pill to swallow.   Renuka Shahane as an elderly Christian lady living alone and quoting an exorbitant price for her house manages to slip into her character with ease. Her unassuming demeanor acts as the perfect foil for what follows in the story.Pulkit Samrat as a businessman who comes to purchase her house is competent. Meanwhile, Masumeh Makhija as a housewife who faces abuse at the hands of her husband and also nurses a broken heart for her ex-lover, uses her eyes to convey her feelings. Sharman Joshi delivers a measured performance as a man who is overwhelmed with mixed feelings when he faces his ex-lover. Debutants Aisha Ahmed and Ankit Rathi are well cast as young lovers who believe that they can overcome the odds stacked against them. Richa Chadha, despite limited screen time, leaves a mark as a seductress who is also the film’s sutradhar.   3 Storeys cleverly demonstrates the art of skillfully telling a story wherein all the loose ends of a plot are tied together into a neat whole. Watch it because fact is stranger than fiction, but fiction when narrated well, can make movie watching an immersive experience.
