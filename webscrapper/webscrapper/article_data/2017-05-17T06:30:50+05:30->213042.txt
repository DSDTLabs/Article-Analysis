NAINITAL: A Haldwani-based businessman has applied for entry into the   for making deposits and withdrawals in odd sums like Rs 11, 33, 99, 111 and so forth for 2,610 times. Earlier, a MP-based man held this record of making such deposits and withdrawals for 2,426 times.
 
    who opened a bank account in December 2016 said, “I have applied for inclusion of my name in the Limca Book of Records with all the necessary documents. The agency has accepted the documents and is processing my request.”
  
  Kumar, who goes by the nickname of ‘Goldie’, told TOI that the idea of making such transactions came accidentally to him while he was depositing a cheque with an odd amount which the bank refused to accept. He filed an   application to find out if any such rule exits which prohibits banks from accepting such denominations. 
  
  “In my application I wanted to know if banks are barred from accepting deposits in denominations like Rs 1,111 and Rs 2,222 as some of the banks refused to accept to take such deposits. Quite often I receive cheques with such figures as payments. The RBI in its reply clearly said that there is no such guideline which says that one cannot make deposits in odd numbers,”   added.
  
  So far, he has made a total transaction of Rs 30 lakh in withdrawals and deposits from his account in sums of Rs 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999, 1,111, 2,222, 3,333, 4,444, 5,555, 6,666, 7,777, 8,888, 9,999, 11,111, 22,222, 33,333, 44,444, 55,555, 66,666, 77,777, 88,888 and Rs 99,999.
  
  Kumar is also a collector of old currency notes or the past 40 years and has a collection of over eight lakh rare and old currency notes. He has also applied for entry in the Limca Book for his unique collection. A doctorate in economics, Kumar has notes with ending numbers like 101, 786, 420, 100, 2016 and 9,999 among many other combinations.
