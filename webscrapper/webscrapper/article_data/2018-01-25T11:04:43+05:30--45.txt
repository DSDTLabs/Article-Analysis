NEW DELHI: The Centre today sanctioned the setting up of a second Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) in Karnataka at Raichur and it was likely to become operational in the current academic year. 

 Human Resource Development Minister  , who is also the BJP's election in-charge for Karnataka Assembly polls due in March- April, said the necessary budget allocation will be provided for the new institute in the Budget 2018. 
 
 It will be the second such institute in Karnataka, after the one in Dharwad. 
 
 The state has been asked to provide alternative infrastructure to commence the 2018-19 academic year till it identifies the land for the construction of the proposed IIIT. 
 
 "Karnataka is one state where there is demand for good and quality education. Many MPs had made this demand. We have decided to give one IIIT to Raichur," Javadekar told reporters here. 
 
 The proposed IIIT will be set up on a public-private partnership mode with land to be provided by the state, he said, as he gave the sanction letter to his cabinet colleague Ananth Kumar. 
 
 Stating that the proposed IIIT-Raichur will bridge the gap in access to quality education in northern Karnataka, Kumar said this was because many of the top institutes like Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Management, National Institute of Fashion Technology, National Law School of India University and   and Neuro-Sciences are set up in Bengaluru. 
 
 "North Karnataka is not having these institutes...there is a divide in science, technology and specialisation education between Bengaluru and northern Karnataka. This is major step to bridge the gap," he said. 
 
 Kumar, who holds two porfolios at the Centre and is a senior BJP leader from the state, urged the Congress-ruled Karnataka government to provide alternative infrastructure for the IIIT to start operations in the current academic year.
