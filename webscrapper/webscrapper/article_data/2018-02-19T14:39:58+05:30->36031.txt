UDHAGAMANDALAM: Activists are up in arms over the police department’s decision to fell at least 487 trees, most of which are more than 50-year-old eucalyptus and cypress, spread across 10 acres at Church Hill area on Havelock Road here to set up a full-fledged parade ground for training police personnel.

 “It has always been a wooded area and a habitat for many birds, leopards and bears. It is not fair to destroy the forest,”  , a resident of Have Road told TOI. 
 
 “The trees are being felled in a hurried manner. Why can’t officials make use of the area housing dilapidated police quarters? After all, it is located near the forest patch where they are cutting down the trees,” advocate Reinia Santy, another resident of the area, said. 
 
 When contacted, a senior police official told TOI that the wooded area belonged to the police department. “We don’t have a full-fledged parade ground in Nilgiris for training police personnel. It is a long-pending demand and now we have commenced the work to set up one on Havelock Road,” the official said.
 
 The procedure, the official said, started two years ago and all the formalities have been followed to obtain permission from the concerned authorities to fell the trees there.
 
 According to Nilgiris SP Murali Rambha, an auction was conducted at the district police headquarters on January 31 and one   was allotted the tender for Rs 18.93 lakh. Kemparaj was given six months’ time to clear the area by felling 487 trees. 
 
 “The value of trees will surely be more than Rs 1 crore. And the bidding was finalised for just Rs 18.93 lakh,” Siddharth, also a faculty member of   in Ecology and the Environment, said. District forest officer (north) S Kalanidhi said the forest department had granted the police department permission to fell the trees at Church Hill area a few months ago. “It was cleared by the district level committee too,” the officer told TOI.
