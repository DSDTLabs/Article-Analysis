LUCKNOW: This   will see well-off Assamese families reach out to the poor in the community by inviting them to be part of celebrations. Though the festival is on Friday, members of   will organize a function at Dilkusha Gardens on Sunday. 

 “Every year, the Assamese community celebrates Rongali Bihu or the Assamese   which marks the end of   season, with songs, dance and a feast. This year, we are taking an initiative to invite the poor Assamese who have migrated in large numbers and are living in the slums, to be part of our celebrations on Sunday,” said Col RD Talukdar, a senior member of the association. 
 
 “There is a tradition of consuming 100 herbs during Bihu, but only two-three are available in Lucknow. We will try to follow as many rituals as possible,” said Anita Talukdar, who has been in Lucknow for eight years.
 
 “We make ‘Ghila Pitha’ or ladoos of rice flour and jaggery to offer it to cattle on ‘Goru Bihu’, the first day of Rongali Bihu. It is a ritual traditionally performed by farmers after bathing their livestock,” said Satvik.
 
 Taranjay, a chef, has taken a day off to celebrate Manush Bihu, the second day of the weeklong festival. He plans to celebrate the day with delicacies like Sunga, Tekeli Pithas, Laroos and Monda. 
 
 “The day is an opportunity to put behind old grudges and pray for each other’s well-being,” said, Hansla Kakoti, Taranjay’s wife.
