Pimpri Chinchwad: As many as 40   of the PCMC-run Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital in Pimpri also went on a   on Thursday, joining their peers in protest against the recent attacks on medicos at various hospitals across the state. 

 The health department said the move increased the work load on other doctors. “However, the services were not affected,” it added.
 
 Maruti Latkar, a resident doctor from the hospital, told TOI that 40 of them have gone on mass leave to protest against the recent attacks on doctors across the state. “The civic administration must take review of available manpower at hospitals. Also, steps must be taken to increase the manpower to reduce the load on doctors,” Latkar said.
 
 He said a pass system must be introduced to allow just one relative to accompany the patient at the hospital. Civic security guards must be trained in mob control to ensure the safety of doctors.
