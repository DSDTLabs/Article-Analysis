NEW DELHI:   state chief Manoj   on Tuesday   DDA for   the   to   of Delhi 2021 and said that this step will provide much-needed relief to traders from the sealing being conducted on orders of the SC-appointed monitoring committee.

 “We will take up the issue of roads that are yet to be notified by Delhi government and also other areas that are not protected under the amendment to ensure that the sealing drive is stopped,” said Tiwari.
 
 Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Maken demanded 100% ground coverage for shopping-cum-residence complexes and said that no penal charges should be levied. “A minimum FAR of 250 was available to local shopping centres and shop-cum-residences way back in MPD 1962. Therefore, no charges could be taken from LSCs for additional FAR or conversion,” he added.
 
 Maken said that apart from Delhi government,   should also be authorised to notify 351 streets for mixed land use as well as other issues on the recommendation of local bodies. 
 
 BJP MLA and leader of opposition in Delhi assembly, Vijender Gupta, said that the AAP government has failed to notify the 351 roads during its three-year term.
 
 Meanwhile, AAP said that the amended master plan will not bring any immediate relief from sealing to traders and they will continue to face problems till Supreme Court accepts the changes, which will take considerable time. The party said that the only solution is for the Centre to bring an ordinance to stop sealing.
 
 “Shops sealed during this drive can’t be opened. The proposal is confusing and will end up promoting corruption. The proposal on restaurants will also add to corruption and render thousands unemployed,” an AAP statement said.
