Chennai: With economic recovery not picking pace, India Inc hasn’t been tapping the markets in a big way for raising money in the current financial year. The total resources mobilised by corporates declined 14.3% year-on-year to around Rs 4.99 lakh crore in the first eight months of 2016-17.

 The total funds raised by companies under the equities route has fallen drastically. Firms have mobilised Rs 55,748 crore through equity issues between April and November 2016, a 38.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) fall. 
 
 Though the money raised through public and rights issues dropped only marginally, there was a steep decrease in mobilisation under the private placements route. Corporates managed to mop up only Rs 31,319 crore through private placement of equity between April and November, a 51.9% y-o-y fall, data with markets regulator Sebi showed. Private placement of corporate debt too declined 8.4% y-o-y to about Rs 4.19 lakh crore. Funds mobilised by companies listed on the BSE and NSE through QIPs (qualified institutional placements) was only Rs 4,318 crore in the first eight months of 2016-17, which is only about a third of the money they got under the route in the same period the previous year.
 
 “The confidence (about the economy) is not back yet,” said Pranav Haldea, MD, PRIME Database, which compiles data on the primary capital markets. “There is not too much fresh capital being deployed for capacity expansion,” he said. “Most corporates are not comfortable about raising debt at high cost,” said Deven R Choksey, MD, KR Choksey Shares and Securities. The only silver lining has been the primary markets with a marked increase in both debt and equity issuances so far in the current financial year. The mobilisation through the primary market jumped more than two-fold to Rs 48,324 crore during the period. Funds raised from initial public offers (IPOs jumped 2.4 times to Rs 23,124 crore. Sebi data showed. On an overall basis, equity issues got 33.8% more money through the primary markets between April and November 2016.
 
 Preferential allotment shares however saw a decline during the period. Firms managed to get Rs 27,001 crore from 279 issues, a 46.5% y-o-y fall in value terms. Capital raised by listed companies from primary markets through QIPs plunged 70.4% to Rs 4,318 crore, Sebi data showed.
