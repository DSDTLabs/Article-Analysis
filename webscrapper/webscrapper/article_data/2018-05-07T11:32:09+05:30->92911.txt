 and Pallavi’s   on  , ‘Maate Mantramu’, is all set to premiere at 8:30 PM tonight. 

  The channel has been busy promoting the show on their social media, posting pictures and promos for the same. “Simplicity & values - #Vasundhara, Rich and spoilt - #Vamsi!! Watch as two different sides fall into a twisted tale of love .. on #MaateMantramu starting tomorrow at 8.30 PM only on #ZeeTelugu,” (sic) reads a promo posted yesterday. 
 
  Fans too have been busy promoting the show, posting it onto fan club groups, urging people to give the show a chance. Another promo reads, “Two individuals with opposite personalities coming together... #MaateMantramu starting 7th May at 8.30 pm only on #ZeeTelugu #ZeeTeluguHD Ali Reza #Pallavi” (sic) 
 
  The promo which sees the protagonists at a temple has received more than 685 likes, 19 shares, 47k views and numerous comments. Comments predict as to how huge a hit the new   will be, some others ask of the ‘Evare Mohini’ show will come to an end to make place for this one. 
 
  When announcing the show, the channel called the show ‘a breathe of fresh air’ on their social media. Filmmaker K Raghavendra Rao was the chief guest for the launch of the show’s shoot on April 5. The first promo saw a woman can be seen praying at the temple, while a man walks in with his family. He raises eyebrows when he refuses to touch the feet of the temple priest, with his grandmother offering support even as a relative chides him. The grandmother declares that he is the dharma karta of the temple and he needn’t bow in front of anyone. The women who was praying earlier comes in and offers the family some prasadam, with the man seemingly falling for her, much to his grandmother’s chagrin.
 
  Looks like the show will be a face-off, charting the love-hate relationship a rich and conceited Vamsi and down-to-earth Vasundhara share.
