THANE: The municipal corporation is working towards developing the city's first dedicated hostel for ladies at   that will provide a safe and economical option for single women who have migrated to Thane for work.

 The approximately seven-storied building will have staying facilities for nearly 155 women in the form of rooms and dormitories spread over 2,000sqm area in the plush   area. The idea, inform officials from the Thane corporation, is to provide a cheap and safer alternative for the women who have come to Thane for work as finding an accomodation in the lake city can otherwise be a costly proportion.
 
 The facility will be developed on an amenity plot by a private developer at a cost of Rs 6.75cr. As the hostel will be built under consctruction TDR, the corporation will not be spending anything from its pockets. The hostel will have 33 triple and seven twin sharing rooms along with seven dormitories. The entire premise will be under CCTv surveillance and will have facilities for recreation and a cafeteria also. 
 
 The accomodation facility at the premise will be available for long term basis and not for those coming on short trips, informed an official. The entire structure will be built within two years following which the rentals and a policy governing it's operations and maintenance will be formulated simultaneously. 
 
 “Many single women from other parts of the state come to Thane for earning a livelihood and finding a safe and economical accomodation here often proves to be a daunting task for them. The corporation will be developing the facility and we expect the same to be operational within two years,” said a senior municipal officer.
 
 The foundation laying ceremony of this ambitious project will be done on Saturday.
