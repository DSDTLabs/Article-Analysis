 has carved a niche for herself in the film industry today. This year, not only was she cast as Mani Ratnam's leading lady in 'Kaatru Veliyidai' but she also plays the protagonist in  's ' ' which marks  's comeback. That's not all, the actress will be seen in a cameo in  's 'Padmavati'. In a no-holds barred conversation, Aditi speaks about combating sexism in the industry and raises some pertinent questions. She says, "I have faced sexism when I lost out on a film because the hero didn’t want me in it. I don’t want to pander to the hero. I am an actress; I am not the hero’s play toy. I am not a two-in-one. Also, why are item numbers not called dance numbers? Does it imply that a woman is an item?" 

 Ask her if voices of actresses who speak up are muzzled and she says, "In my industry, I don’t think people want you to shut up, but they will slut-shame you. But, ultimately, if the person believes in herself and her family stands by her, the slut-shaming won’t have any effect. Then, the ones indulging in it look like idiots and not the person who is standing up for herself.A lot of actresses have spoken out against a lot of these issues, but I guess some people don’t want to address it. I don’t judge them at all. They are working with certain people and they don’t want to bite the hand that feeds them. On one hand, they say that I am talented and on the other, they want me to be their play toy. I have actually been even told that I am talented, but I probably won’t get too many films because I don’t spend time with them. So, I didn’t get those films, but I did other films. Ultimately, you have to be comfortable with yourself and I guess it comes from my upbringing. Having said that, I am not sitting on a high horse and judging anybody."
