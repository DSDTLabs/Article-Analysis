AHMEDABAD: Drawing upon the experiences of building its own campus,   (IIT-Gn) has started a five-day course called “Seismic Analysis and Design of Confined Masonry Building”. 

 The thirty-six buildings at the new IIT-Gn campus in Palaj constitute the largest engineered application of confined masonry construction in the public sector in India.
 
 “The course, which began on May 15, is being taken by more than 25 postgraduate engineering students from IIT-Gn, along with those from several Ahmedabad-based institutions such as CEPT, LD College of Engineering, Nirma University, and   from Jammu and Kashmir,” said a statement from IIT-Gn. Confined masonry is a composite masonry and reinforced concrete construction technology, where masonry walls are constructed first and reinforced concrete elements are cast afterwards. 
 
 IIT-Gn director, professor Sudhir K Jain, who is also the president of International Association for Earthquake Engineering (IAEE), said, “We need building typologies that are suitable for our requirements.”
