PANAJI: Union minister for   on Saturday said the Goa government is open for talks with   over the   water dispute. Naik, whose statement comes days after Prime Minister   and BJP national president promised farmers of Karnataka during an election rally to resolve the issue, with Shah setting a six-month deadline to find a solution, said, “Neither Shah nor PM Narendra Modi have made such a promise.”

 “The matter is sub-judice. On humanitarian grounds, if something is possible, we can do. The matter will be discussed (with Karnataka) and brought to an amicable conclusion. We don’t want any conflict; we want to settle the issue nicely. We are always open to discussion,” Naik said.
 
 In December, chief minister Manohar Parrikar wrote to BJP’s Karnataka state unit president B S Yeddyurappa stating “in principle Goa would not oppose reasonable and justified quantum” of drinking water to Karnataka from the Mhadei river on “humanitarian grounds”. Karnataka CM inister Siddaramaiah dubbed the move as a “political gimmick”. 
 
 Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra are currently contesting parties before the Mhadei Inter-state Water Disputes Tribunal over the controversial Kalsa-Bhandura dam project across the Mhadei river, through which Karnataka aims to divert water from the Mhadei basin to the nearby basin on the Malaprabha river. This is not acceptable to Goa where the river is considered as a lifeline.
 
 Naik reprimanded Karnataka for resuming work on diversion of Kalsa nullah into Malaprabha basin in defiance of the Supreme Court order not to recommence the project while it is pending before the tribunal. “They played a little bit of mischief by having some illegal construction near the river. We don’t support the illegal construction, which Karnataka has done,” he said.
 
 Karnataka had raised mud embankments on the Mhadei tributary drastically reducing water levels in the Barazan and Ladkecho waterfalls in Surla village.
