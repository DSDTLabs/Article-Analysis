MUMBAI: Air-conditioned (AC) rakes on the suburban system will become a norm as the railways has decided to manufacture all coaches under the   ( ) with this feature.

 A senior railway official said, “Railway board chairman A K Mittal has cleared the file for procurement of 47 rakes under MUTP-III with AC features. A formal letter will soon be issued to the   ( ).”
 
 The railway had proposed non-AC rakes with automatic doors but many officials raised doubts over its feasibility for the suburban network. They pointed out that due to over-crowding in trains, carbon dioxide levels can stay quite high in coaches once doors are closed. This was conveyed to railway board officials in January 2016. Western and   officials backed this assertion.
 
 Once the specifications are finalised by Research Design & Standards Organisation (RDSO), tenders can be floated. Sources said tenders are expected to be floated by July. Unlike BHEL rakes manufactured at ICF, Chennai, the railways may opt for Metro-type rakes where the AC system will be fitted in the coach’s under-frame. The cost will be higher at Rs 7-8 crore per coach, compared to Rs 4.5 crore if the AC is fitted atop the coach. MRVC will have to order 546 coaches under MUTP-III and it will take at least three-and-a-half years to get rakes in the system from then.
 
 Global tenders will have to placed as MUTP is financed by World Bank. A similar process for followed before finalising orders for rakes under MUTP-I and MUTP-II.
