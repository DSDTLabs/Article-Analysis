 In the foreign exchange market, the   scaled a fresh 16-month high at 65.41 per  , compared to its Tuesday close at 65.81, but after intervention by the central bank closed at 65.69. Expectations of increased buying by foreign funds in India is leading to the appreciation of the rupee, market players said.
 
 Government bonds also rallied on Wednesday with the benchmark yield on the 10-year gilts closing at 6.83%, compared to 6.9% on Tuesday. Dealers said absence of any government borrowings and a better-than-expected core   figure at 4.9% for February helped buying.
