CHANDIGARH: A day after former   leader   announced the formation of   (HSP), Kurukshetra MP   on Saturday denied having any link with the new political outfit. “I don’t have link with any party other than BJP. I am not linked to any party, especially the one floated by Arya,” he said.

 Arya, who is Saini’s associate in agitations against Jats, announced to launch a new party on Friday and that the post of the party’s president had been left vacant for Saini.
 
 Referring to   stir, Saini asked   (AIJASS) president Yashpal Malik to furnish an affidavit of the withdrawal of their agitation. He asked Malik to contest any election against him from any part of Haryana. “Let Malik give an affidavit that he and his community will not continue the agitation. Let him ask his community members to withdraw the ongoing stir. Following that let him choose the constituency and I am ready to contest against him from any place in Haryana,” said Saini at Kurukshetra.
 
 Malik had challenged Saini on Friday to contest elections against him from any parliamentary or assembly constituency in Haryana.
