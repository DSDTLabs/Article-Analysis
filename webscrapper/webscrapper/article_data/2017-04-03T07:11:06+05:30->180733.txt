Gurgaon/Delhi: Like UP,   will now have to shell out   every time they enter  . 

 This is not the result of Haryana adding a new tax but streamlining its collection system and letting the transport department collect the levy. 
 
 So far, no taxes were collected at the Haryana border because the motor tax for goods and passenger vehicles was to be paid to the excise department while a road tax of Rs 950 for three months was paid to the regional transport authority. Now, these charges have been consolidated into a Motor Vehicle Tax that will be collected at the borders by the state transport department. 
 
 The move, however, has not gone down well with Delhi-based cabbies, who have threatened to protest if the Motor Vehicle (MV) tax is not rolled back. 
 
 While taxis headed towards Ghaziabad and Noida in UP pay Rs 100 as tax, no such tariff was collected at the Haryana border, not because the tax did not exist but that many got away by not paying it. Officials said a majority of cabbies entering Haryana from Delhi never paid the tax, leading to revenue losses.
 
 Virender Lather, additional transport commissioner, Haryana, said, “The Haryana Motor Vehicles   Rules, 2016, has been notified. Both motor and road taxes have been consolidated into a single Motor Vehicle Tax from April 1. Owners and drivers of goods and passenger vehicles have been told to collect the clearance certificate of tax paid up to March 31 from the excise and taxation department.” 
 
 Delhi-based cabbies have decided to protest outside Haryana Bhavan in the capital and go on an indefinite strike. Sanjay Samrat, president of  , said, “The association is meeting on Monday. We will plan a ‘chakka jam’ across Delhi.”
