AHMEDNAGAR: A group of farmers from   in Karjat taluka of   district has claimed that the firm owned by fugitive businessman   had acquired 235 acre of their land at throwaway prices.

 
 Around 200 protesting farmers, including women, arrived in bullock carts at the land in Khandala village on Saturday and ploughed a part of it using tractors as a symbolic move to ‘reclaim’ the land.
 
 The farmers, who carried the national flags besides photographs of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr BR Ambedkar, raised slogans against Nirav Modi, who faces allegations of defrauding the state-run   to the tune of over Rs 13,000 crore. The said land is among the properties attached by the Enforcement Directorate as a part of its probe against Modi, who has fled the country. The Ahmednagar district administration was, however, not aware of the protest. District collector Abhay Mahajan told TOI that the farmers have not yet officially made any such demand.
 
 “There was no law and order problem. It (protest) was organised quietly, so we got no reports. I have asked the sub-divisional officer (SDO) of Karjat to submit a report. The land has been taken over by the banks and we do not have any right on it. Details have been sought from the officer regarding the protest,’’ added Mahajan.
 
 The sloganeering protesters carried the banner of a local farmers’ organisation, ‘Kaali Aai Mukti Sangram’.
 
 According to the farmers’ body, the land was acquired by Nirav Modi’s company in 2011 and the farmers were paid between Rs10,000 and Rs15,000 per acre, although the prevailing market rate at that time was Rs 2 lakh per acre. The protesters also alleged that while farmers were always at the receiving end to get loans, people like Nirav Modi got it easily.
