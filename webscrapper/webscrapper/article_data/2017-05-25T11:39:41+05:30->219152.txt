PANAJI: The Asian   Confederation ( ) has delayed its decision on the status of the   (ISL) till next month.

 AFC general secretary Dato Windsor John held extensive talks with All India Football Federation ( ) president   and general secretary   in the Capital on Wednesday. But an expected an announcement was put off till another meeting in Kuala Lumpur on June 7.
 
 The meeting, which will be chaired by Windsor, will be attended by various AFC directors. Invitations will also be extended to senior representatives from Fifa's competition department, senior representatives from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, I-League and ISL Clubs, AIFF's commercial partner and the Football Players' Association of India.
 
 The decision to hold another round of talks, and that by involving several stakeholders has caught many by surprise. One plausible reason is the involvement of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee who has thrown her weight behind the Kolkata's big clubs,   and East Bengal, both of whom are likely to lose out if the two leagues ­ ISL and I-League ­ are played simultaneously over five months.
 
 "The AIFF is simply buying time," said a source who is closely tracking the development.
 
 The AIFF has told the AFC that they want to accord official status to the ISL and run both leagues simultaneously. According to the AIFF proposal, the AFC Champions League playoff slot will be reserved for ILeague champions while ISL champions will qualify directly for the AFC Cup, Asian football's second-tier club competition.
 
 An earlier proposal for one additional slot has been rejected by the AFC, while plans to give a continental slot for the Super Cup champions have been kept on hold. The Super Cup, a contest between the top four teams from the I-League and ISL, will be played towards the end of season and will replace the existing Federation Cup, reserved for the eight best teams in the country.
