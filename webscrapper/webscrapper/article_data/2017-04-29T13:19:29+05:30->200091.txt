SURAT: A 40-year-old woman attempted suicide by consuming kerosene on Friday in Limbayat following harassment by private financiers, who had forcefully taken possession of her house to recover money. The woman alleged that she had already paid Rs 10 lakh as interest against loan of Rs one lakh in 2014, but there was no end to loan sharks’ demands.

 Sahida Ansari, a resident of economic weaker section housing colony in Dumbhal, was shifted to hospital where her health was said to be stable. In a suicide note, Ansari named some individuals who were allegedly pressurising her to recover the money she had borrowed. Earlier, she had lodged a complaint in Limbayat police station against private financiers over harassment. Some of them were arrested by police.
 
 She alleged that she had borrowed Rs 1 lakh from private moneylenders for treatment of her six-year-old son. She later paid around Rs 10 lakh as interest over three years but the loan shark demanded more money. She also alleged that the moneylender’s men forcefully threw her out of her house and took possession of it. She was forced to live on terrace with her family, she alleged.
 
 Ansari alleged that she went to make representation at Limbayat police station on Friday to get back possession of her house, police did not listen to her and forced her to leave. She later consumed kerosene to end life. Her husband   works at a mobile phone repair shop.
 
 Sources in police informed that the woman had mortgaged her house to other moneylender and borrowed money. City police commissioner   had recently issued orders to register complaint against private financiers harassing people.
 
 “Police had earlier arrested a few accused on a complaint by the woman. If she asks for police support to get possession, we may help her within limits of law,” said R P  , deputy commissioner of police, zone I.
