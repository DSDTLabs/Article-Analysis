Rajkot:  ,  

 Acting on complaint of Rubina Afzal Lakhani, a resident of Chamaliyapara on Morbi Road, police booked her husband Afzal Hussain, mother-in-law Rashida, father-in-law Hussain Jamal, sister-in-law Suhana Akram Khorani and Rashida’s father Karim Osman for mental and physical harassment, beating and under other sections of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 In her complaint, Rubina has alleged that ever since her marriage to Afzal five years ago, she has been facing harassment at the hand of her husband and in-laws. About 18 months ago, she had an argument with her husband and in-laws over household work. She alleged that Afzal thrashed her following which she fell unconscious. And while she was unconscious, Afzal gave her triple talaq. When she came to her senses, Afzal’s mother told her that her son had divorced her and now she will have to leave the house.
 
 Rubina went to her father’s place with her son and has been living there since then. Meanwhile, some community leaders and family members tried to resolve the dispute between the husband and wife, but all efforts failed. So Rubina lodged a complaint against Afzal and his family members with the Rajkot mahila police. Police inspector B T Vadhiya is investigating the case.
