  Phillauri is Anushka Sharma's second production venture after her stellar hit NH10. In this movie, she will be seen playing the role of a spirit known as Shashi who gets trapped in the human realm after Kanan marries a tree to cleanse his bad luck and how Kanan (Suraj Sharma), a man born under an unlucky star, helps her return to her own realm where she used lived in the tree. Directed by Anshai Lal, the movie also star Diljit Dosanjh who plays the role of Anushka's onscreen love interest. It is all set to release in theatres on March 24. 
 
 
 The actors sweep in and carry the film, though. With his body language and voice modulation, Suraj Sharma nails the confused-aimless millennial and lightens the mood. Mehreen Pirzada’s helpless and hopelessly-in-love Anu is endearing. Diljit Dosanjh brings his trademark goodness to a rather bland role. And as the translucent ghost (kudos to the VFX team), Anushka delivers a solid performance with a weird mix of sadness and humour. 
 
 
 
  Phillauri grossed 3.50-3.75 crore nett apprx on its opening day according to reports on boxofficeindia.com. According to the figures quoted by the producers, 'Phillauri' earned Rs 4.02 crores on day one.
