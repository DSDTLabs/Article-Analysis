KOLHAPUR: The district has been facing rotational forced load shedding owing to failure of a 500 MVA transformer at the power supplying sub-station in   taluka on April 26.

 According to chief engineer of Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Company Limited (MSETCL)   and chief engineer of Kolhapur zone of Maharashtra state   (MSEDCL) MG Shinde, the repair work will take another three days.
 
 “Kolhapur receives electricity form the 400 VC High Tension (HT) station. The daily demand of the district is around 1,100 megawatt and the company has installed three power transformers capacity of 500 MVA and two 315 MVAs. But the 500 MVA transformer went dysfunctional on April 26. The repairing work will take another three days,” said Patil.
 
 Public relation officer of   zone   said, “Despite the rise in demand we have sufficient electricity to cater to the needs of Kolhapur. But due to failure of power transformer, an emergency like situation has been created. We didn’t have any option but to start rotational forced load shedding.”
 
 Giving further details, Shinde said, “We have received assistance of additional units from MSETCL to repair the transformer. Hence, it would require less time. We have taken care of agricultural consumers. There are no changes in the night slots for irrigation. But we have reduced their day slots by three hours. We are trying to avoid losses of the farmers.”
 
 Kolhapur president of Maharashtra irrigation federation Vikram Patil said, “The MSEDCL officials have given us an assurance to resolve the issue in three days. We have demanded compensatory hours of electricity after power supply resumes.”
