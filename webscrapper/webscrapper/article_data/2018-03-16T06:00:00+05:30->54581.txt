Kolkata: China and India should negotiate and sign an FTA (free trade agreement), a treaty of good neighbourly friendship, combining the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by Beijing and the development strategy proposed by New Delhi, said the Chinese consul general in Kolkata.  Ma Zhanwu was speaking at the International Buddhism Symposium being held here on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Hsuan Tsang Monastery on Thursday.  Both countries will become more influential in the world through a sound and steady relationship based on enhanced people-to-people exchanges, friendship and mutual trust, he observed. The two nations, Ma added, can make better use of personalities such as Hsuan Tsang and Rabindranath Tagore to enhance their relations. The Chinese consulate, on its part, will establish a Hsuan Tsang Award and confer it on those who have made outstanding contributions to bilateral ties. It also plans to work with local partners to launch the Hsuan Tsang Cup Chinese language competition. The international symposium, on ‘Buddhist Exchanges between China and India: Past and Future’, was jointly held by the Chinese consulate general in Kolkata, the Lingyin Temple in Zhejiang province of China, the Hsuan Tsang Monastery and Cheena Bhavana of Visva-Bharati University.  Master Huirong from Hsuan Tsang Monastery, Master Guangquan from Lingyin Temple and Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Prof Sabujkoli Sen, along with over a dozen scholars from both countries, deliberated on ‘Buddhism and China in India’ and ‘Impact of China India Buddhist Exchanges’. Ma aptly summed up the day’s proceedings, stressing that both nations have learnt from each other and so claims that exchanges have been only one way are not true.
