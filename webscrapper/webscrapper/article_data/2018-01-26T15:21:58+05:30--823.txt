GURUGRAM: A team of   members and   catchers hired by the   caught and rehabilitated more than 50   since Sunday. The operations were conducted in sectors 53, 55 and 56, which are located close to the Aravalis and have been troubled by simian menace.

 Similar   will be carried out in other areas, where people have been complaining about the monkey problem. 
 
 “We have caught more than 50 monkeys in the past few days and released them in the wild. We will carry out such operations in other areas too. Residents facing monkey menace in their areas can contact us through the helpline,” said an MCG official. 
 
 The MCG had recently hired an agency to help bring down the monkey menace in the city. Monkey catchers have been called in from Mathura. The whole process of catching and rehabilitating monkeys will be videographed to ensure that no cruel method is exercised in the process, said the MCG official. “A health check-up will be done on the monkeys after they are caught and then will be released into the forests in the presence of officials from MCG,” said another MCG official. 
 
 In April last year, a city-based NGO had filed a police complaint against the MCG-appointed agency for sedating monkeys with drugged bananas. However earlier as well, the corporation has tied up with agencies and NGOs for monkey catching, but it has not helped in containing the monkey menace in the city.
