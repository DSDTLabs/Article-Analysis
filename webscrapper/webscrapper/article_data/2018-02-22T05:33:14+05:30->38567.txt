THANE: The citizens’ community rallied in support of municipal commissioner  , who on Tuesday publicly declared he had been targeted by a section of corporators for cracking down on encroachers and urged them to move a no-confidence motion against him.

 A local residents’ association started a signature campaign demanding Jaiswal be retained, while several others spoke of online drives in support of the bureaucrat. On Tuesday, Jaiswal had appealed before the 131-member-strong   general body to pass a vote of no-confidence against him saying it would force the state government to transfer him from the city.
 
 The bureaucrat said he was distressed by the growing bitterness with a few corporators and said the animosity was getting personal and affecting his family too.
 
 Meanwhile, activists backed him, saying he had helped launch several new initiatives that would otherwise never have been possible.
 
 “The city has benefited a lot during the tenure of Sanjeev Jaiswal. It would definitely help if the bureaucrat stays back so that other infrastructure projects undertaken by him can see the light of day,” said T N Raghunatha, a citizen activist.
 
 The   is planning a rally this week. “It’s time to act right for the future of our families and the city we call our home. We are reaching out to maximum residents and seeking support for extension of the commissioner’s tenure,” said  , another activist.
 
 The online world was also abuzz with support for the bureaucrat.
