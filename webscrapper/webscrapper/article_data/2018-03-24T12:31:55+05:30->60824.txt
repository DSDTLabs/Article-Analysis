PATNA: The Centre for Health Policy (CHP) at Asian Development Research Institute ( ) organised a roundtable discussion on ‘Gender disparities in infant mortality rate (IMR) in Bihar’ here on Friday. The main focus of the discussion was on settling the contradiction among different data sources on gender disparities in IMR.

 Dr   from   (PHFI) presented her analysis on triangulation of all data sources. She emphasized that the decline in IMR is smooth over the period and there should not be any real gender gap in IMR as per statistical reasoning.
 
 Dr Saswata Ghosh from CHP, ADRI argued that there is huge inconsistency between reported IMR and estimates of probability of deaths obtained by using life tables.
 
 Dr   from CARE India, Patna, presented his analysis from their household survey data. He highlighted the apparent gender disparity in treatment-seeking behaviour among infants.
 
 Principal secretary of state health department   highlighted different initiatives being taken by the state government to reduce gender gap in treatment- seeking and to improve health outcomes, especially among under-five girls in the state. He said the state government would take concrete steps to reduce gender disparity in child healthcare.
 
 Dr Yamini Atmavilas from Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation moderated the entire discussion. Dr Shaibal Gupta, member-secretary, ADRI, emphasized that the message from such high level technical discussions should reach lawmakers and larger audience through media and other sources. He suggested that the legislators should be informed about key outcomes of such discussions for further deliberation and decision at appropriate forum.
