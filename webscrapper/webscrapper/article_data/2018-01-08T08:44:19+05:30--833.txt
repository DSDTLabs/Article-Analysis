PATIALA: Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF) chief and a   Harinder Singh   has reportedly gone on hunger strike inside   alleging that the jail staff was demanding Rs 2 lakh gratification from him to move him to a bigger cell. 

 The matter came to light during Mintoo’s appearance in a Ludhiana court on Saturday through video conferencing, during which he told the court that he had gone on a hunger strike as the jail staff was keeping him in an isolated and dark cell.
 
 Mintoo’s lawyer Jaspal Singh   in a statement issued to the press stated that Mintoo was also facing a life threat inside the jail premises and he had informed the judge about the same. 
 
 However, the jail officials have denied the allegations, including hunger strike by Mintoo. 
 
 Jail superintendent   said Mintoo was a dreaded terrorist and had been kept in a separate cell due to security reasons. He also denied the reports that Mintoo had gone on a hunger strike and said he had met the accused in the morning when Mintoo had reportedly told him that his lawyers might have misinterpreted his statement given in the court. 
 
 Meanwhile, Manjhpur said it was a case of human rights violation of a prisoner and he would take up the matter at an appropriate level.
