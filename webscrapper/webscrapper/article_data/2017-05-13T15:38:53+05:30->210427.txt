MANGALURU:   (VBRA) has come out strongly against a proposed move by the   to change the bank’s logo and  . 

 Terming it a waste of precious money of the bank, the association noted that the present logo registered in 1965 – a humble man, full of courtesy and friendly appearance – is one of the most eye-catching and attractive logo. It is very popular and well-known amongst the customers.
 
 A B Shetty, chairman of VBRA said likewise the tagline of the bank – a friend you can bank upon – is a time tested one. Change of logo and tagline involves a huge expenditure. The bank has more than 4,000 outlets, comprising 2013 branches and 2001 ATMs. In addition, there is a head office, various department head offices and regional offices. The bank has its hoardings across various locations including railway stations, airports, bus stations and so on, he said.
 
 If either the logo or the tagline is changed, the bank’s boards in all these locations, ATMs in different locations must be changed. Normally, in the name of uniformity, such contracts are awarded to a single contractor and the contractor must erect the new boards at all these places, Shetty said. The bank’s logo, if changed, must be changed in stationery and forms such as cheque books, DD books, deposit receipts and a host of other such forms, he noted.
 All this will result in wasteful expenditure that could run in to crores of rupees, he said. This move is also against a directive from the union government to all public-sector banks against huge and wasteful expenditure. 
 
 “For a bank like ours, which is a household name for good customer service, this is an unwarranted expenditure,” he said, adding that the bank’s employees – serving and retired – as well as customers are opposed to the same and demanded that the move be dropped.
