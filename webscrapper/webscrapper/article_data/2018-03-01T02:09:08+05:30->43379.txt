Udhagamandalam: A group of women on Wednesday brought smiles on the faces of nearly 125 students from various government middle and elementary schools in and around Ooty as they organised an English teaching programme for the latter involving games, quiz, singing and model telephone conversations. 
 
 The one-day programme was organised at Sullivan Court, a three star hotel by 10 women attached to the NGO Siragugal. 
  
 “We roped in students from 10 government middle schools for the programme. We wanted to give them an entirely different experience in a new environment and hence brought them to a star hotel. The foremost focus of Siragugal is underprivileged children. And our programmes cover fields of art, craft and sports in an effort to get them better exposure,” said Kalyani Chidambaram, president, Siragugal. 
  
 And the students really had a thrilling experience. “This kind of programme is very new to our students as it is activity based. It certainly gives more scope to our students to learn new words in English,” Lynthy Janet, a teacher from Municipal Middle School at Thalaiyattimund in Ooty told TOI. 
  
 According to her, students were so enthusiastic and expressed eagerness to learn at the event. 
  
 Malathi, Class VIII student of a middle school in Odaikadu in Kulicholai said she really enjoyed the programme. “This is the first time i am attending this kind of English programme. It is fun learning things through activity-based programmes.” 
  
 Siragugal has sponsored an English teacher and a computer teacher to the middle school in Thalaiyattimund in Ooty, besides donating two computers. “We conduct English teaching programmes once in a week in government schools. This kind of big event is held only once in a while as it involves huge funds,” Kalyani said.
