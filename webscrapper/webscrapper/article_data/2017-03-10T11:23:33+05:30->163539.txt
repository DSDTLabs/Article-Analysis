SHILLONG:   chief minister   on Thursday told the assembly that the   (MHIS) has been lauded by the Union health ministry, which has asked other states to replicate it. 

 The Union health ministry had asked the Meghalaya government to make a presentation on the scheme, the chief minister said.
 
 "The   said it is a very innovative scheme," the chief minister said. He added that while the health scheme of the Centre pertained to BPL families only, the state health insurance scheme has been extended to all people on the lines of universal health insurance, said Mukul.
 
 "Patients of all categories are getting benefits of the scheme," he said. He added that providing quality healthcare to all was one of the biggest challenges faced by the government. 
 
 "The MHIS will pave the way for private investments in the state's health sector," said Mukul. He added that the programme should be given a thrust. 
 
 Earlier, during question hour, state health minister Roshan Warjri said Phase-II of the scheme concluded on October 31 last year and that it is again expected to resume next month. 
 
 Answering to a query by leader of the opposition,  , she said the reason for the delay in implementation of the next phase of the scheme was 'repeated tendering process'.
 
  Informing that the tendering process has now been completed, she said the state government was awaiting approval from the Centre, which bears 90% of the cost of the state health scheme.
 
 Observing that the state's scheme was one of the important programmes of the government, speaker Abu Taher Mondal requested the government to expedite implementation of the next phase of the scheme.
