LUDHIANA: The police have booked a 28-year-old labourer for kidnapping and raping a minor.

 In his police complaint, father of the 17-year-old girl said his daughter had gone to buy milk from the market at 9pm on May 12 and didn’t return. “We searched for her everywhere, but could not find her. The next morning when she returned, she broke down and told about the incident,” the street vendor added.
 
 The girl said when she had gone to the market, the accused -- Dev  , a resident of Jujhar Nagar -- was standing on the road and forced her onto his bike. He took her to his house from Teda Road and raped her through the night. The accused then left her near a light-point, from where she reached home, she added.
 
 The complainant then informed the police, who, on Monday, booked Kumar under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC and sections 4 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 
 Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector   said a manhunt has been launched to arrest the accused. “The medical examination of the girl was conducted at civil hospital and the report is awaited,” he added.
 
 Police officials said according to the survivor, the accused raped her in his room when his parents were at home.
 
 Cops said the girl has studied up to third standard and had left studies about eight years ago.
