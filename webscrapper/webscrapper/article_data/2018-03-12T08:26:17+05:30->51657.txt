LUDHIANA: Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal — Punjab’s eco baba — known for cleaning polluted rivers in the state, has urged the city’s businessmen to launch an initiative to clean up Buddah Nallah, which runs through quite a significant part of Ludhiana’s old areas.

 Baba was in the city recently to attend a conclave on green plastic, organized by the Income Tax department. Speaking on the issue, Seechewal said: “Buddha Nallah is a blot on such a big city like Ludhiana, and it is the result of our negligence and habit of running away from responsibility. There was a time people used to take bath in the waters of Buddah Nallah, and today it is among the most polluted water bodies, not only in Ludhiana, but the entire country.”
 
 He added: “It is really strange that in an industrial city like Ludhiana, where such big business houses are based, no one has come forward to take up the challenge of cleaning the Buddah Nallah, while everyone is waiting for governments to clean it up. It’s high time Ludhiana’s businessmen realize their responsibility and step forward to form a common platform, which should include environmentalists, social workers, and other stakeholders. I am ready to extend any kind of help for this noble cause, and contribute in every possible way for cleaning up the Nallah to make it Ludhiana’s lifeline once again.”
 
 After Seechewal’s address to the audience, some businessmen expressed their desire to be a part of the clean-up initiative, and requested Seechewal to revisit Ludhiana to provide them guidance on how they can proceed towards cleaning up the depleted water body at the earliest.
