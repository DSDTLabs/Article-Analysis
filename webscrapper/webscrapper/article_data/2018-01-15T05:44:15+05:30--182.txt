NEW DELHI: Eight key states logged a massive increase in demand for work under the job guarantee scheme   this fiscal, an increase that is seen as astronomical in the history of the programme.

 Three other states saw high demand during the earlier part of the year but have registered a sharp fall in later months. Still, the annual demand for work under MGNREGA is projected to stay below or, at best, touch the levels of 2016-17.
 
 Curious is the story of MGNREGA in 2017-18 when the scheme swung from being reviled by the ruling BJP as a "shame" to having to tap extra funding to tide over demand of the last four months. The rural development ministry this month pumped in Rs 7,000 crore more, securing Rs 3,500 crore from the finance ministry and mopping up the rest from savings in its other schemes.
 
 What makes for interesting reading is MGNREGA notching lakhs of extra 'persondays' of work across Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.
 
 As the high demand for distress labour across poor and rich states lends itself to comments about rural stagnation, the rural development ministry attributes it to work being done under the rural  .
 
 Secretary, rural development, Amarjeet Sinha, said 54 lakh houses were in different stages of construction under PM Awas Yojana where each house was being supplied with 90 days of labour from the job scheme. Also, a quarter of the expenditure under the PM's rural road scheme came from MGNREGA, he added.
 
 Despite the spike, according to the ministry, the demand for work is projected to touch 225 crore 'persondays' in 2017-18, as against 235.75 crore 'persondays' in 2016-17.
 
 Chhattisgarh registered a sharp rise in demand, monthon-month, over 2016-17 â€” 1.18 lakh in August, 2.58 lakh in September, 4.27 lakh in October, 6.57 lakh in November and 7.86 lakh in December.
 
 In Gujarat, the last five months saw an extra demand of 72800, 76825, 43239, 84842 and 46574 'persondays'.
 
 The increase in 'persondays' in Jharkhand in the last five months was 2.9 lakh, 3.9 lakh, 4.12 lakh, 3.5 lakh and 1.2 lakh. The same trend of jump in demand was noticed in MP (39.5 lakh persondays), Maharashtra (11.35 lakh) and Rajasthan (10.66 lakh).
