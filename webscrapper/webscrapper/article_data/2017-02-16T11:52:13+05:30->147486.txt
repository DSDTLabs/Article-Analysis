Kareena stops Soumya midway and asks for her vote. She pretends to forgive Soumya for her misdeeds. Soumya thanks her but tells her that she considers Mallika as her mother. Hence, she will elect her for the post. 

 Surbhi gets tensed due to Soumya's absence in the house. Preeto tells her that she has gone with Harak Singh to the temple to pray for Harman and her. Surbhi is not convinced. 
 
 Soumya ends up voting for Kareena to be the next Guru Maa, which shocks everyone including Mallika. Meanwhile, Harman and Surbhi get worries as Soumya is nowhere to be found. When they quiz Preeto about the same, she tells them that she'd be back soon.
 
 
  
 Doubting her intentions, Harman leaves the house to go the temple to find Harak Singh and Soumya. 
 
 Malika's supporters are disheartened with Soumya's decision but Mallika stands tall against them. She continues to support Soumya and tells her that her vote would have helped her look after her. Soumya thinks of telling the truth to Mallika.
 
 After gaining Soumya's vote, Kareena begins to execute her plan against her.
