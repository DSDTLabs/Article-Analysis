CHANDIGARH: Almost a month after the first report of pilferage of   from the PGI, it remains easy to sneak into the storage area. On Saturday, TOI’s reality-check team encountered no guard or security camera. 

 Chandigarh Pollution Control Board director Santosh Kumar found it “strange” that the elite medical institute that had begged for more time to conduct an inquiry into the theft had still not deployed a guard in the biomedical-waste area. The coming week, the board plans a surprise check.
 
 The rules of managing biomedical waste require colour-coded segregation at the source and collection points. However, the TOI team found that the red bags (containing plastic waste such as syringe, dextrose bottle, intravenous set, and urinary catheter) and the yellow bags (for soiled infected waste such as dressing material and blood-stained cotton swabs) were not segregated at the collection point.
 
 On August 22, TOI had exposed scrap dealers who sold biomedical waste outside the college. The inquiry committee that the institute had formed after this report had suggested preventive measures such as installing   (closed-circuit television) cameras and raising the height of the boundary wall along the collection point.
 
 The PGI, which has 1,740 sanctioned and 208 observation beds, generates 1,412 kilograms of biomedical waste every day. It includes both toxic and hazardous material, which rag-pickers lift easily from the unguarded collection point and carry through the forest behind this dumping ground. Behind the PGI’s boundary wall, their helpers are ready with carts or tempos to carry the waste to the point of sale.
 
 Sources in the PGI said the security team had come to know of minor thefts by Class-IV employees. A notice from the pollution control board had forced the PGI to institute an internal inquiry. On Friday, it sought 15 more days to complete the investigation.
