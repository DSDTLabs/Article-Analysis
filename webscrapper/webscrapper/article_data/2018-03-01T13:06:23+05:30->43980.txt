DIMAPUR: In a state where cash takes centrestage in election and 59% of the candidates are crorepatis, Akavi N Zhimomi flaunts a near empty wallet. He declared in his poll affidavit that he had just Rs 8,000 in his account. His is the story of how a poll campaign turned into a social campaign creating waves in   with people from across the country pitching in over one slogan - corruption-free society. 

 The 27-year-old became the toast of the social media and youths from Kohima and as far as away as Bangalore and Delhi added sheen to the campaign in Ghaspani-I constituency in Dimapur. "I just got an Aam Aadmi Party ticket and some caps. Central AAP leaders were clear they were neither going to campaign for me nor provide me with any funds," said Zhimomi on Wednesday, a day after votes were cast. "I had just Rs 70 with me when I filed my nomination," he said.
 
 He, however, got 'angel funding' of a different kind. Absolute strangers helped him with poll material and cash. "My posters were printed by a press for free. Then someone donated bottles of water. And as word of my campaign spread, two people came forward and lent us their cars till the day of results," said Zhimomi, surrounded by volunteers at his father's house that had become an election office of sorts. "There were seven others sleeping with me in one room," he said with a laugh.
