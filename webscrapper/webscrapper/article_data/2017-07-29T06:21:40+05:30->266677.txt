KOLKATA: Cathay   on Friday became the first international airline to introduce self-printing web-generated boarding cards at Kolkata airport. This will considerably reduce check-in time and lead to shorter queues at the check in counters. Other airlines are expected to roll out the facility soon.

 The feature allows passengers to check-in and print their boarding cards 48 hours to one hour prior to their flight. International passengers with web generated boarding cards will be required to report to the   counters for check-in of baggage and verification of travel documents only.
 
 Kolkata airport director Atul   said printer terminals has been provided at all three portals at the international terminal.
 
 There are already five check-in kiosks at the domestic terminal. “We intend to increase the number to 10 this year,“ Dikshit added.
