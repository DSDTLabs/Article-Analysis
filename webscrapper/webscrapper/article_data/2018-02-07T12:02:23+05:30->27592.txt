JAIPUR: Prompt action by a 27-year-old police constable foiled the biggest-ever robbery attempt in the country. Had he not opened fire, robbers would have looted Rs 925 crore from a city-based bank branch on Monday night. 

 About 13 armed, masked robbers reached the branch in C-Scheme area around 2.30am, overpowered the private guard and tried to open the shutter gate. Alarmed at the commotion, constable   - who was on duty inside the bank - opened fire, forcing the gang to flee.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 "While the gang was trying to break open the shutter, Sitaram first saw them from inside. Without wasting a second, he opened fire," said ACP (crime) Prafful Kumar. The constable immediately raised an alarm and within minutes, a large number of cops rushed to the spot. The police control room and wireless office were also intimated, following which barricading was done, said the ACP, adding that cops are examining   footages to identify the robbers.
 
 "It is a centralised chest branch where the money is collected and later sent to various branches of the bank across the state. This seems to be a pre-planned act since the robbers were aware of the amount of cash available in the branch on Mondays," Kumar said.
 
 Police claimed that the bank branch wasn't following security and safety guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India. "Preliminary reports suggest that the branch had no 'time lock', which is a must at chest branches. Also, shuttering wasn't properly done and cash meant to be inside the strong room was kept outside," said a senior police officer. 
 
  With such a robbery bid taking place at a centralized bank branch - situated only three kilometres from the state's secretariat - the lofty claims of   about their proactive night patrolling are raising questions.
