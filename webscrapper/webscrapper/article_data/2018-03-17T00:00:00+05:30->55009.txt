A musical event was organised by folk singer   paying a tribute to her mentor late Girija Devi. Malini shared that she chose the title ‘Pranami’ for the tribute as her guru who never took any fee from any of her students but always asked for ‘Pranam’, which was in the form of a musical offering. Malini started the event by singing Hey Mahadev Maheshwar and later sang several other songs.
