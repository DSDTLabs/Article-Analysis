NOIDA: Industrialists in the city, in their wish list to Union finance minister  , have sought a  .

 In a written list of demands sent ahead of the   2017, the Noida Entrepreneurs Association (NEA), the umbrella body of Noida’s medium- and small-scale enterprises (MSMEs) has stressed the need for intra-state connectivity via the arterial railways system of Uttar Pradesh, as well as with the rest of the country.
 
 The entrepreneurs said a railway station connecting the twin cities to the rest of the state would help speed up mobility of the workforce from the villages to the manufacturing hubs of Noida and Greater Noida. It would also help in efficient cargo transfer.
 
 Vipin Kumar Malhan, NEA president, said that Noida was essentially an industrial city and it was surprising that for the 40 years of Noida’s existence there has been no effort to build a railway station here. “A railway station is needed here for sourcing manpower from the rural areas as well as to help in movement of cargo as most goods transfer now takes place via the road network,” Malhan said.
 
 The wish list also stresses the need for a lower rate of interest for financing MSMEs. “The MSMEs should be granted loans at between 5-6%. Most of the industries here are export-based and in order to keep our supplies price competitive with China, Bangladesh and Korea, we need to lower or price bracket. That is only possible by lowering the interest rates,” Harish Joneja, convener, Central Excise and Electricity, NEA, said.
 
 Noida and Greater Noida together have over 9000 manufacturing units, which employs over 7 lakh people.
