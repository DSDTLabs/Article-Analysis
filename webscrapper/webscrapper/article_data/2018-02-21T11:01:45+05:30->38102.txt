BENGALURU: The   has upheld the conviction of life term awarded to a   for strangling his wife to death, barely 10 months after their love marriage. 

 The prosecution has established the chain of circumstances leading up to his death. The oral and documentary evidence is against the accused. There's no error or perversity committed by the trial court in appreciating the evidence on record, a division bench of Justices Ravi Malimath and K Somashekar observed. It upheld the sentence awarded to   of Hebbakka village in Tumakuru district.
 
  A Tumakuru court had on August 13, 2012 convicted Lakshmipathi for the murder of  . It awarded him life term for the murder and three years imprisonment under   section 498A (cruelty to wife). He was fined Rs 10,000 for the first offence and Rs 5,000 for the other. Lakshmipathi had initially been booked for cruelty to wife and abetment to suicide but was later charged for murder on the basis of the postmortem report and probe. 
 
 The prosecution had argued that Latha was repeatedly subjected to mental as well as physical harassment by Lakshmipathi during their 10-month marriage. They married at the sub-registrar's office after both their families consented to their wedding. However, he began ill-treating her later and on October 22, 2010, strangled her to death with his hands.
 
 Lakshmipathi moved the HC, arguing that since it was a love marriage, there was no question of him ill-treating his wife. His counsel also contended that he was not present in the house when Latha died.
 
 However, the public prosecutor cited evidence before the trial court, pointing out that Lakshmipathi had called Latha's mother   over phone between 4.30pm and 5pm to inform her about the death in his house. Latha's relatives said he was an alcoholic and addicted to playing cards. He tortured and tormented his wife, saying she is not of fair complexion and if she dies, it would help him remarry.
