PANAJI: Attorney   has called the officials of directorate of mines and geology to Delhi to seek some clarification in the   issue before taking a final decision on the review plea. 

 The state government had forwarded to him three legal opinions, including the one from senior counsel Harish  .
 
 Speaking to TOI, a senior government officer at the Secretariat said the meeting is likely to take place sometime next week. 
 
 On February 7, 2018, Supreme Court had quashed the second renewal of 88 leases and directed the state to stop mining operations from March 15. 
 
 This was the second time mining activities came to a halt in state, the earlier being in September 2012.
 
 Chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who is undergoing treatment in the  , has given his consent to file a review petition.
 
 Senior counsel Salve in his opinion had said the state stands â€˜no chance' of obtaining a favourable verdict in case of a review. 
 
 The other two opinions were from the   (GMOEA) and the mining workers union, which backed the review plea.
 
 Union minister Nitin Gadkari had recently said the Centre would obtain opinion of ministries concerned, besides stakeholders, and forward it to the Attorney General.
 
 After SC verdict, the state government had sent a draft to Salve, seeking his opinion. It included the history of Goa's mining industry, various court decisions, details about how economic activities will be affected and other pertinent information.
