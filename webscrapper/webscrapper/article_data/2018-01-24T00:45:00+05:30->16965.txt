Trichy: Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (Credai), an apex body of private real estate developers associations, will organise a three-day exhibition showcasing real estate projects across the city from Friday at Hotel Sangam here. Titled Fairpo 2018, the exhibiton will see about 20 builders putting on display over 30 projects, including flats and individual houses, priced between Rs 20 lakh to Rs 1 crore in two dozen stalls. The event will exhibit miniature models of upcoming and completed projects, said officials. The programme is expected to create a platform for Credai builders to market their projects and set a stage for customers to meet multiple builders across the state to analyse the available real estate project works. “Properties worth over Rs 225 crore, including twin bungalows, individual flats, and independent houses in the city and suburbs will be showcased in the Fairpro 2018 expo. Officials from six banks will set up stalls offering home loans on concessions,” said Credai chairman S Anand, Trichy. Organisers said that all projects to be displayed in the exhibition have been given approval by banks and finance institutes, making it easy for the investors to get their loans sanctioned. “Real estate prices have bottomed out and the interest rates are at an all-time low. This is the best time for buyers to buy constructed and in-progress properties at affordable price,” said Credai Trichy chapter president P Ravichandran. A subsidy of Rs 2.5 lakh for eligible home buyers will be available for the costumers attending the exhibition under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY), a credit linked subsidy scheme.
