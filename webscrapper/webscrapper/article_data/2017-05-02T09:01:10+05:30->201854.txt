MUMBAI: Over the last five years   have recorded the highest   ( ) of over 16% and now account for over 12% of all  . Overall credit to industry during the same period has slowed to single digits at 6.7% after a negative growth this year. Though the share of loans to industry in March 2017 were still hight at 37.5%.

 According to data on sector credit released by the RBI, bank credit to industry as on March 31, 2017 stood at Rs 26.77 lakh crore which is 2% lower than outstanding bank credit of Rs 27.30 lakh crore as on end-March 2016. This has resulted in the slowest growth in bank credit in decades.
 
 The main driver of bank credit in 2016-17 has been home loans which stood at Rs 8.60 lakh crore, 15% higher than Rs 7.46 lakh crore as on end-March 2016. The share of housing which was 9.26% on March 2012 has been rising over the years. The last time bank credit to housing was in double digits was in 2009, when the government introduced special schemes to boost demand in the wake of the global financial crisis. “Between FY12-FY16 bank credit registered double digit growth, barring in FY15 when credit grew by 9%. However, growth in bank credit slowed to 5% in FY17. The slowdown has mainly been on account of banks stressed with bad loans, stagnant corporate investment environment and some migration to the debt market,” said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist,  . 
 
 The slowdown in lending to industry is largely because of PSBs which have reduced their exposure to corporates. After home loans,   outstandings are the fastest growing segment which have grown at a CAGR of 20% over the last five years. However, they account for less than 1% of bank credit and are one of the smallest components of lending to the personal segment — smaller than education and auto loans. Bankers say that this is despite a large base of credit card users as Indians prefer to settle their bills at the end of the month. Credit card outstandings have more than doubled from Rs 20,400 crore as on March 2012 to Rs 52,100 crore as on March 2017.
 
 In the services sector, it is loans to professional services, trade and to   that have been driving credit growth. “The performance in FY18 will depend on how the manufacturing sector fares as this is required for revival in growth in bank credit. It is the driving force. With the increase in commodity prices, the absolute demand for loans could come up. With overall   growth expected to be only moderately better in FY18, the pick up in credit would more likely be only gradual in nature,” said Sabnavis. He adds that CARE has forecast a 7-8% growth in bank credit this year.
