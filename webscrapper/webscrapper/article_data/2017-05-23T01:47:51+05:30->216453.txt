NEW DELHI: Traders of Asia’s largest spare parts market Kasmiri Gate on Monday protested against the 28%   on car spare parts, tractor parts and car accessories. They said the hike was exorbitant and likely to affect the growth of their business. 

 Traders from Mori Gate who are engaged in tractor parts’ business also participated in the protest and marched through the market. “Only 12% VAT is charged on auto parts and car accessories, which has been increased to 28%,” said Vishnu Bhargava, general secretary of Automotive Parts Merchants’ Associations.
 
 The traders said they were not against GST but the rate should be less. “From 28% the rate of GST should be decreased to 18% for auto parts and car accessories and 12% for tractor parts,” said Brijesh Goyal, convener of AAP’s Delhi trade wing. The traders will put this up before deputy CM  , who will raise this issue in the GST council meeting.
