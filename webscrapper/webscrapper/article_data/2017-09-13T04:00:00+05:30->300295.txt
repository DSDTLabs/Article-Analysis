Ahmedabad: The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence’s Ahmedabad zonal unit has arrested the kingpin of a gang allegedly involved in the smuggling of 16 metric tonnes (MTs) of red sanders, valued at Rs 8 crore in the local market and Rs 16 crore in the international market.

 The stock was seized near Vasad in March this year. The accused, identified as Vijay Subbanna Poojary, was detained under the COFEPOSA (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act), 1972, and was lodged at the Nashik Central Jail. The officers of the DRI brought Poojary to Ahmedabad under a transfer warrant on Sunday. He was then formally arrested and produced before the additional chief metropolitan magistrate’s court which remanded him to the DRI custody for two days that ended on Tuesday.
 
 DRI officials said that it was revealed during the inquiry that a syndicate which included Poojary and his accomplices — Fakhre Alam Shaikh, Wasim Hajwani, and Touqeer Alam — had hatched a criminal conspiracy to smuggle the red sanders, an endangered species, out of India through a port in Gujarat. The stock was being transported in a container on a truck. The drivers were Abdul Hamid Shaikh and Ajay Sadanand Rane. They were accompanied by Hukumadin Shaikh and Raees Dastagir Shaikh. The consignment was being taken to Rajkot from where it was to be transported to Pipavav port in Mundra for illicit export out of India. It has also emerged that this syndicate had also smuggled red sanders out of India on a number of occasions in the past.
