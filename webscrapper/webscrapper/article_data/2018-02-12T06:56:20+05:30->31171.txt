HYDERABAD:   in   is now passé. The chicken   and other parts of the country is fed with a medicine that doctors around the world prescribe when most drugs fail to cure a person. The drug Colistin might be a ‘last frontier’ for humans but it also works as a growth promoter for poultry and can increase the weight of the birds at a faster rate.

 A study conducted in Hyderabad (Rangareddy district) and other parts of India by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ), United Kingdom, reveals that Colistin is mixed with feed and given to poultry in farms. The investigative reportmakes a mention particularly of poultry farms surrounding Hyderabad. It also states that poultry feed containing Colistin is proudly marketed with pictures of ‘healthy and happier’ chicken.
 
  
  
 Since the poultry industry in India is mired in heavy losses and is mostly managed by illiterate farmers, the problem of antimicrobial resistance thrown in by unscrupulous use of Colistin often goes unnoticed. People, who eat chicken fed on Colistin, develop resistance to this drug over a period of time and when they actually become ill, they do not respond to it. Already a few superbugs have developed resistance to Colistin, though the drug continues to be the ‘last hope’ of doctors.
 
 The   revealed that as much as 150 tonnes of Colistin is imported every year for poultry use. This is a huge quantity, given the fact that Colistin is used in very minute doses for treatment of ill people. “At least five animal pharmaceutical companies in India are openly advertising products containing Colistin as  ,” the report said.
