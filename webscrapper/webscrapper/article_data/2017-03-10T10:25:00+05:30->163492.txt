CHENNAI: Unit 2 of   reached its full capacity of 1,000MW at 6am on Thursday, becoming the   in the country to generate 1,000MW. Unit 1 which was re-started after maintenance also touched 800MW at the same time. 

 Plant sources told TOI that both the units will generate more than 1,800MW till mid-April when Unit 1 will be shut down for re-fuelling though Unit 2 will continue power generation. Tamil Nadu will get around 1,000MW from both the units. 
 
 “We have a achieved a milestone with Unit 2 early morning today as it touched 1,000MW. Since August last year, the unit has been   at various capacities and after reaching near full capacity, tests were undertaken and the reactor was re-started. Since then it has been generating power,” site director Hari Narayan Sahu told TOI.
 
 The unit will undergo further tests but will keep generating power. “There will be uninterrupted power generation from Unit 2 except for a short shutdown later this month. During the next few months when the demand is likely to increase, the unit will generate power continuously without any break. We are monitoring the grid and will operate the unit as per requirement,” said Sahu.
 
 Meanwhile, Unit 1 will reach the maximum capacity of 1,000MW and continue till mid April. “We will have to shut down the unit next month to refuel. The entire process will take at least 10 days or a little more,” said Sahu.
 
 “We are keeping our fingers crossed with regard to   reactors. We hope at least one reactor generates power to the maximum capacity during summer months as there is drought and it is difficult to get water for thermal plants,” said a senior Tangedco official.
