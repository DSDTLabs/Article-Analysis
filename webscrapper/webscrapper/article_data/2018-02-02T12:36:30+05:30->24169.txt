 When the CBI special judge, J Nazar, considered their petitions on Thursday, the counsels of the accused sought one more week to present the arguments. 
 
 The judge also gave a warning to the defence counsels that the court would look at the petition for three consecutive days and if the accused were still not ready to present their contentions, the court would give appropriate orders on the petitions. The judge also held that it was not ready to grant more time for the accused.
 
 The court will consider the petitions again on Friday.
