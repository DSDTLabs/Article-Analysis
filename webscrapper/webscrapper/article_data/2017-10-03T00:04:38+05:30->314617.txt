Thiruvananthapuram: Ever since National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) took up works to widen the Kazhakkoottam-Mukkola road, the approach road to airport remained a stumbling block. Later,   decided to retain the   by redesigning it. However, the design is yet to get final approval. Now, the issue has started affecting the road widening works on Chackai-Enchakkal stretch.

 More than six months have passed since the regional office of NHAI sent the proposal to NHAI Delhi office for in-principle approval. However, the project is yet to receive approval. 
 
 Though NHAI has achieved physical progress of around 70%, it could not do any work along the 2km stretch from   due to delay in permission. Also, the approach road on Chackai side of railway overbridge too is getting delayed due to this. 
 
 As per the proposal, around Rs 142 crore will be needed for construction of the flyover. This is in addition to the total cost of the work.
 
 While NHAI decided to take up construction of flyover at Kazhakkoottam as a standalone project, it decided to allot work to construct flyover at Chackai to KNR Construction, which is undertaking the NH widening works. The decision not to take up it as a standalone project was taken up to avoid delay.
 
 As per the proposal, the flyover will start from Chackai overbridge and will end around 400 metres ahead of Enchakkal junction. It will have ramps on either side at Chackai junction to facilitate movement of vehicles to Sanghumukham side and Palayam side.
 
 Vehicles moving towards airport can take the existing route - those vehicles should not enter the new flyover and take the existing route after getting out of Chackai ROB, and then take a U-turn to enter the ramp to airport. The ramp and proposed flyovers will have a 15m difference in levels. The proposed flyover will have a length of around 1.6km and width of 19.6m. tnn
