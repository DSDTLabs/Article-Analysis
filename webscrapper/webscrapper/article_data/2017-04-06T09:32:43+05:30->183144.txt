RANCHI:  ,  ,  , on Wednesday reiterated the Supreme Court (SC) order that the government cannot make   mandatory for extending benefits of its  . 

 Activists of right to food campaign in the state met the food minister and sought his intervention in the matter following the chief secretary’s announcement of invalidating ration cards not linked to Aadhaar by April 5. Assuring the activists of taking proper measures in the case, Rai issued directives to the departmental secretary to ensure that the apex court’s order is not violated under any circumstances. 
 
 “The state cannot go beyond the ruling of the apex court, so the secretary has been asked to clarify the status of the decision immediately,” Rai said. He added that he has forwarded copies of the SC’s order and representation of the campaign activists, which stated that in case the government has decided to mandate Aadhaar cards, it should immediately be revoked to avoid violation of court orders.
 
 Asharfi Nand Prasad, state convener, right to food campaign, said the recent order of the state government to make Aadhaar mandatory for availing ration under the public distribution system (PDS) was tantamount to depriving many people from the benefits of the right. “SC in its repeated orders said Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for the extension of benefits of welfare schemes of the government, yet the chief secretary on March 27 announced that all ration cards without Aadhaar linkage would be invalid from April 5,” Prasad said, describing the order as an open violation of SC’s order.
