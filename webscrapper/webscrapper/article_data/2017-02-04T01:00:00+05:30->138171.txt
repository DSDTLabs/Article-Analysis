 is facing a ‘heavy’ issue these days. The actress, currently seen in ' ?', has put on seven kilos in three months and is struggling to shed it. 
She says, “I am struggling with my weight. The camera makes it look even more drastic and many people following the show have brought it to my notice. Being a fitness-conscious person, it’s quite worrisome for me. What has added to my woes is the fact that I play a modern character and wear Western clothes, so there is no way I can hide the flab.”
 Though her dietician put her on a strict diet, it didn’t help. “When everything failed, I underwent a series of tests and was diagnosed with hormonal imbalance, which is caused by stress. We pay a lot of attention to our diet, but never to our mental health. I have started medication, and it will take me time to lose those extra kilos healthily. I need to be extremely patient,” she says. 
 The stress, Neha says, was caused by a break-up that happened a year-and-a-half ago. “I immersed myself in work to distract my mind from the personal crisis. But that was a wrong decision — it’s always better to address the issue rather than fake a calm demeanour. It was a beautiful relationship, but it was not meant to be. Everything was fine and I was even willing to move to the US post marriage since he is an NRI, but he developed cold feet at the last minute. He assumed that being an actress, I would be too career-oriented to become a homemaker. He is married now and I wish him all the best.”
 So, what does she think of love and marriage now? “It’s good as long as you don’t have unrealistic expectations from each other. I will not go out of my way to accommodate a man in my life. You have to complete each other. I definitely want marriage as I am total gharelu. More than love, I want the man to understand me,” she says.
