This week’s release,  , is about four young men vying for one girl. The characters of the young men are from different strata of society, so when it came to composing songs for each of them, music director   had to keep in mind the particular class of society, to ensure that each song is authentic in its mood and strikes a chord with the target audience.

 “The main brief that I received for the film was that the music had to be youthful. All the characters have different lifestyles, so while   is a high-energy number,   is melodic. The way their general lifestyle is, mechanics and auto drivers may not like very melodious songs. After a hard day at work, they want something that can pep them up. Moreover, the lyrics of Mechanic Nee Titanic have a very day-to-day feel. Nakshatra, on the other hand, is aimed at a more classy audience, who go on romantic long drives,” says Manikanth. Speaking about   — which is the most popular song from the film online — Manikanth adds, “That song features all the lead actors, so it has a general youth feel to it. That song is not targeted at any one particular audience; everyone can relate to it.”
