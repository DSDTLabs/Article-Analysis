PANAJI: Goa Forward Party candidate Jayesh Salgaonkar is leading against   and current tourism minister Dilip Parulekar in Saligao in the 2017 state assembly elections for Goa. Salgaonkar is likely to benefit from the entry of Aam Aadmi Party and the   in the seat which is seen to be loyal to Parulekar. Salgaonkar is currently leading with 3070 votes with Parulekar coming close behind with 2379 votes. With just a gap of 691 votes, the possibility of Parulekar edging out Salgaonkar is not ruled out.

 In the 2012 state assembly elections, Parulekar polled 10084 votes to independent candidate Tulio D’Souza’s 4276 votes. Parulekar had won by a massive 5808 votes in 2012. AAP’s Dattatraya Vittal Padgaonkar is a distant third with 518 votes but long time Congress leader   appears to be facing the biggest disappointment with 443 votes.
