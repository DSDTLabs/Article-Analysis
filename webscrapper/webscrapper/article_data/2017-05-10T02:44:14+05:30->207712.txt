NEW DELHI: At a time when it is using its consistent opposition to triple talaq to woo Muslim women,   has reached out to OBCs in the minority community saying the   government’s “pro-poor” policies will help them and cautioning them against parties who treat them as mere “vote banks”.

 Building upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s pitch to ‘Pasmanda’ or the socially backward among Muslims, the party on Tuesday held a convention of OBC Muslims to claim that the government’s policies have been inclusive and beneficial for all communities.
 
 “The poor Muslims have been unable to take advantage of the welfare schemes for minorities but Prime Minister Modi’s ‘pro-poor’ policies will uplift them,” minority affairs minister   told a rally attended mostly by backward Muslims from Uttar Pradesh,  , Jharkhand and Delhi.
 
 Hailing the PM for the constitutional status to National Commission for Backward Classes, the minister said parties Congress, TMC and JD(U) came to power with the support of Muslims but blocked the bill, which would have benefited the backward members of the community.
 
 “Patrons of secularism like Congress, RJD and others did nothing for them while getting their votes all these years. But Modiji says nobody should be poor and his welfare schemes will help backward Muslims,” said Sabir Ali, former MP and BJP national executive member, who organised the event.
 
 Pasmanda, a numerically dominant segment in the community, have been a decisive factor in elections. Bihar CM   had managed to get their votes even when he had contested the state polls in alliance with BJP in the past.
