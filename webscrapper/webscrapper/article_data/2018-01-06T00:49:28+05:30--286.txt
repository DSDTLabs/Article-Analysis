 Haryana police had arrested the 42-year-old bus conductor in the case but after the CBI officials took over the case, they arrested a Class XI student of the same school. Kumar was granted bail and released from jail on November 22. He has alleged that the police had tortured him to make him confess to the crime.
 
 “I was at home on Wednesday morning when two men walked in and enquired for me. I used to be scared when Haryana cops would question me as they never said anything without beating me up, but CBI officials were nice. They only asked how I was and what was I going to do next,” said Kumar. He added that he was confident when he spoke with the CBI officials.
