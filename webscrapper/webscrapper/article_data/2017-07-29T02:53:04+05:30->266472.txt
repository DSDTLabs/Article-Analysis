NEW DELHI: A doctor accused of raping a woman was   by a city court after the woman said she had consensual   with him. 

 On being questioned by additional sessions judge   on why she had filed the complaint against the doctor when the physical relations were consensual, the woman said that the man had proposed marriage to her but later started avoiding her, after which she approached the police.
 
 The court observed, “On scrutinising the woman’s testimony...no incriminating evidence has come on record to proceed further. In these circumstances, further trial would not serve any purpose”. 
 
 The case was lodged in July 2016. The woman alleged that the man got in touch with her through a matrimonial site. He was posted in a hospital in Jodhpur and had proposed marriage to the woman, asking her to meet him in Delhi. The woman in her complaint said that in June the same year, he met her and took her to a hotel in central Delhi where after drinking he forced himself on her. 
 
 The woman had also claimed that the man refused to marry her, after which she lodged a complaint against him. However, the woman changed her stand in the court. She also said that the man had neither threatened her nor took her obscene videos or photographs. “Since no incriminating evidence has come on record, the accused is acquitted from the charge...,” the court held.
