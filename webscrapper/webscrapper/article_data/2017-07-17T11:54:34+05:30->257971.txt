KOCHI:   has approached the   seeking bail in   on a   in a moving car. He was arrested recently in connection with the case. 

 On Saturday, a lower court had turned down his plea. Dileep's lawyers had hinted that they would be approaching the high court, instead of approaching a sessions court as is the normal procedure. 
 
 In his bail plea, Dileep has alleged that police arrested him based on a statement given by Sunil Kumar alias 'Pulsar' Suni, who is the first accused in the case. No probe or inquiry was conducted by police to verify the veracity of the statement given by 'Pulsar'Suni, Dileep alleged. 
 
 Dileep has also questioned the lack of clarity on the part of police regarding his role in the case. There is no mention of his role in the Remand Report filed by police, he points out. 
 
 He was arrested by police after he filed a police complaint in which he accused 'Pulsar' Suni of blackmailing him. Of the 19 pieces of evidence cited by police, 8 are against his staff members and not against him, Dileep has contended. The court is scheduled to consider the bail plea in the afternoon session.
