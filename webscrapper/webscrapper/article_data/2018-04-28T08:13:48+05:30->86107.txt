AMRITSAR: The newly-inducted cabinet minister for school education O P   released 'Realities and the Reforms', his vision for his department in 2018, here on Friday. Later talking to media, Soni said he had been contemplating a strategy for the betterment of education system which could act as a spinal cord for the state and the nation. 

 He was also accorded a guard of honour by the police personnel. Soni said his biggest challenge in Punjab was to develop the elementary, high and secondary education infrastructure especially in the border and rural areas. Filling the vacant posts, balancing of the staff, providing nutrition, books and instruction to students and filling the teachers with the spirit to educate would begin with the first stage, he said.
 
 He said modernization in education and instruction system would fall after the state had upgraded its infrastructure at par with the model   of Chandigarh.
