VIJAYAWADA: The Special Category Status Sadhana   on Thursday called for an ‘Andhra Pradesh bandh’ on April 16 to protest against the   government ‘not allowing’ the noconfidence motion to be tabled in Parliament. However, emergency services will be excluded from the bandh. The Opposition YSR Congress, Congress, CPI and CPM have announced their support for the bandh. A number of peoples’ organisations, employees’ unions and trade unions also extended their support to the bandh call.

 Samiti president   announced the state bandh during a protest he and leaders of YSR Congress and Left parties held at the Lenin Centre here on Thursday to counter the fast being observed by PM Narendra Modi in Delhi against the washout of the budget session of Parliament caused by the opposition parties.
 
 “There is a need to tell the nation that what Modi did by observing the fast on Thursday was wrong. The PM failed to protect the democracy in the country by not taking up the no-confidence motion in Parliament. It is for the first time that a government ran away from the no-confidence motion,” Srinivas said and added that Modi’s protest was ‘misleading’.
 
 Srinivas said   MPs have served notices of no-confidence only to expose the ‘failure’ of the Prime Minister and the government in implementing the promises made to the state, including granting special category status. “The PM should have faced the motion and replied in the   rather than sitting on a fast,” he said.
 
 Extending his party’s support, YSR CP leader KP Saradhi reiterated that they have been fighting for SCS right from the beginning and charged the TDP with misleading people. CPM state secretariat member Ch Babu Rao also extended support and said both the   and TDP need to be exposed for denying SCS to AP.
