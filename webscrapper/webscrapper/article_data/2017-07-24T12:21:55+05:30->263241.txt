BENGALURU:   MP Jairam Ramesh on Sunday said he is for abolishing Bharat Ratna and  . 

 His remarks came in response to the objection from the audience at the Dr Ambedkar International Conference that the Congress opposed Ambedkar all along and the party did not confer Bharat Ratna on the maker of the Constitution when it was in power. 
 
 Taking part in a key-note session, Ramesh said: “When Bharat Ratna was instituted, it was decided that it should never be given away posthumously. And that’s the reason why the Centre did not confer it on Ambedkar. But the policy was revised subsequently and the government started conferring the award posthumously.” 
 
 Dr B R Ambedkar was given the award in 1990 when V P Singh was the prime minister.
 
 Commenting on political influences in awarding these recognitions, Ramesh said the awards had lost their sanctity and he would abolish them within 24 hours if he is made the prime minister. He also blamed the   and RSS for trying to “appropriate Ambedkar and his legacy.” 
 
 
 
 
 The MP came down heavily on the NDA government for adopting “anti-democratic policies and suppressing the voice of the opposition in Parliament.”
 
 Ramesh described Modi as the ‘murderer of democracy in India’. “The word Modi stands for Murderer Of Democracy in India as the prime minister is presiding over the anti-democratic regime in the country,” Ramesh told reporters.
 
 His comments came in the wake of BSP leader Mayawati’s resignation from Rajya Sabha recently, complaining that she was not being allowed speak on the floor of the House. “The government is not encouraging debate in the house. Most of the bills the government is bringing in are in the form of money bill and the intention is to avoid discussion,” he alleged.
