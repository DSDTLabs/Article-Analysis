HYDERABAD: Former Indian captain Mohammed Azharuddin on Thursday approached the Hyderabad high court urging it to set aside the election conducted to the executive committee of the   (HCA) and also sought the clubbing of all the cases that challenged this poll for a comprehensive hearing. Justice A V Sesha Sai, who heard the plea, posted the case to Monday. 

 Election to the   was held on January 17 and, in tune with an earlier  , the results of the election have been kept in abeyance. Azhar's counsel Ramakanth Reddy told the court that one T Seshanarayana and few others approached a civil court in Ranga Reddy district with misleading contentions and obtained an order directing the HCA to hold elections.
 
 Since this was an order that was obtained by playing fraud on the court, it needs to be set aside and that would automatically nullify the hurried election conducted contravening every direction given by the Supreme Court and Justice Lodha Committee, he said. 
 
 In the case of members, a list of members has to be published, that was not done by the people who organised themselves as an adhoc committee to conduct elections. Even the appointment of the returning officer was not done as was mandated by Justice Lodha who said that retired election commissioners of the state or the neighbouring states should be taken as returning officers.
 
 Azharuddin lamented that when the apex court was trying to cleanse the cricket of unwanted elements from the country's cricket, certain unwanted elements have now started subverting the spirit of this order.
