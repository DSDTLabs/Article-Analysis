The group surrounded them and were about to thrash them when a passenger intervened and saved them. “They initially tried to evade the man’s questions, but later told him that they are from Gokulpuri. The man had a relative there and told him about the kids, following which they were traced,” an officer said.
 
 The local police were alerted and the kids were finally reunited with their families.
