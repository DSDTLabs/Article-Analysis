  Vinod, a stall owner at the festival, said, "We always put up our stall at the festival. Every year, the festival receives a good response. This year, however, because of the heat, thereâ€™s a drop in the footfall." However, the heat didn't bother some of the visitors. Sunaina said, "I always attend the festivals organised at Dilli Haat. The sun doesn't bother me."
