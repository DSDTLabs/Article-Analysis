Jaipur: As   table in the city is depleting every year, the state government has decided to supply treated water in Vidhan Sabha building and SMS stadium. For the same, a pipeline will be laid to connect these two buildings with sewerage treatment plant (STP) at Sahkar Marg. A senior JDA official said, “The construction of a storage tank has begun. At both these places 10 lakh litres treated water will be supplied every day. Both the outer pipelines will be constructed by the JDA. The treated water was earlier released in drains after 1MLD, sewerage treatment plant (STP) was released.”

 At present, water from the ground is extracted at SMS Stadium and Vidhan Sabha. “Stadium and the state assembly administration has given consent to supply treated water. This is for the first time that STP water will be supplied through water pipelines.”
 
 The three big parks in the city — Central Park, Ramniwas Bagh and Jawahar Circle have STP plants. However, water treated is being utilised by these garden and is not sufficient to supply to other buildings. “The new STP would increase the water table in the area as a large amount of groundwater is extracted to fulfil the needs.”
 
 There are many areas in the city, where water table has depleted due to non-availability of surface water. As new residential complexes that are coming up like Mahal Yojana in Jagatpura depend on surface water, decline in water table by 2.25 meters has been witnessed. A senior official of UDH department said, “Private borewells are a serious threat to groundwater table. The PHED department will have to take the responsibility of providing water to the high-rise apartments in the city.”
