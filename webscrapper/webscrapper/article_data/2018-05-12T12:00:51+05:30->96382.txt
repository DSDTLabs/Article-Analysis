VADODARA: The   was the brainchild of Jagannath Sadashiva Hate. The hunt for a source that could supply water to the city so that it could overcome frequent cholera outbreaks had begun around 1870 during the reign of Khanderao Gaekwad. But it took around 20 years for the dream to materialize. 

 Schemes of getting water from river   and Mahi as well as from atop Pavagadh hill were considered. Plans were made to get water even from   river and tanks at Savli and a large well was sunk near  , but had to be abandoned. 
 
 Eventually, Hate came up with the plan for   and work began on it in January 1885. The earthen dam was 3.5 mile long and 15 feet wide. Its height at the highest point was 56 feet. It was built on Surya rivulet and Vaghali nullah. When constructed it had a water spread of around 5.5 square miles. Water was drawn using a 30 inch main line to Nimeta where it was filtered and then sent to the city in a 30 inch main line with gravity force. 
 
 The reservoir was made at a cost of Rs34 lakh and was named after Sayajirao III at the insistence of the people. The reservoir was ready in 1890 and tapped water supply to the city was inaugurated by Sayajirao III in March 1892. The citizens had popularly called it ‘Nalganga’ at that time.
