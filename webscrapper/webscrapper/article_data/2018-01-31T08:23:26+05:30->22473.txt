AMRITSAR: To sink their differences, newly elected mayor of Amritsar   called on local body minister   on Tuesday and drove him to the office of Amritsar Municipal Corporation (AMC).

 Rintu arrived at Sidhu’s home at around 10.30am, exchanged pleasantries with him, took his blessings, and took him to his office.
 
 Expressing his resentment with the state Congress for not taking him into confidence while picking the mayoral candidates, Sidhu had boycotted AMC's general house meeting, which was held on January 23 to elect its eighth mayor. Fifteen municipal councillors, all Sidhu loyalists, had also boycotted the meeting and didn’t take the oath.
 
 In return of Rintu’s gesture, a "generous" Sidhu not only assured his support to Rintu for the development of Amritsar, but also sanctioned Rs 9 crore for the cleanliness drive in the city.
 
 “Every member of the Municipal Corporation, mayor and commissioner are like my family members and we all will work together for the development of the city,” Sidhu told TOI. He said he would himself kick-start the cleanliness drive in the city on Wednesday from the houses of Safaisewaks, adding that it would be regularly monitored and he would ensure that there was no dearth of funds for the purpose.
 
 Meanwhile, the fifteen Congress party MCs who had boycotted the mayoral election but later rushed to   to take oath in the office of divisional commissioner on January 25 had submitted their replies to District Congress Committee resident Jugal Kishore Sharma who had issued them a show-cause notice and had warned of disciplinary action.
 
 Sharma said that he had received the written replies of MCs which had been forwarded to Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president   who would take the final call.
 
 Sources said that the 15 MCs have regretted boycotting the mayoral election due to some "misunderstanding" and have pledged to tow the Congress parties policies.
