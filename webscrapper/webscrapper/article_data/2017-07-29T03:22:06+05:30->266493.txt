MUMBAI: Three days before senior state police service officer M B Chenigund’s  , the   on Friday slammed the   over its failure to initiate action against him in an alleged recruitment scam case. 

 A division bench of Justice Rajendra Savant and Justice Sadhana Jadhav directed the state to initiate appropriate criminal proceedings, including under the Prevention of Corruption Act, against the officer.
 
 The allegations against Chenigund, who is currently   ( )  , relate to accepting bribes to recruit employees when he was principal of the State Reserve Police Force training school. 
 
 “Prima facie we are not satisfied with the manner in which action is being taken against a senior officer who has been indicted (in an internal inquiry report),” said the judges. “Having regard to the seriousness of the allegations we expect the state to take stronger action.”
 
 The court was hearing a petition by Sangita Patil, widow of a deceased police officer Dyaneshwar Patil, who was deputed to the SRPF training school and had lodged a complaint with his seniors.
 
  In 2013, the then director general of police Sanjeev Dayal had ordered an internal inquiry, which concluded that bribes of Rs 1 lakh were collected from officers to select them in the recruitment drive. Advocates Vivek Salunke and Rupesh Zade, counsel for the petitioner, claimed no action was initiated against the indicted officers.
 
 The court said despite its January 2017 orders to the state to spell out what action it proposes to take against Chenigund, it was informed that a departmental chargesheet was issued to the officer on July 25, days before he was to retire. “The chargesheet is a damp squib and done just to satisfy the court. The departmental inquiry is an eyewash,” the judges observed. “If senior police officers resort to corruption what sort of message is being sent to junior officers. There has to be some deterrence.”
