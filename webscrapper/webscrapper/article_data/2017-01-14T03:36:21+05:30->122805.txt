THANE: A one-and-a-half-year-old   suffering from a condition called  , was assisted by a veterinarian to lay an egg that had been formed.

 “If the bird is unable to descend the egg from its abdomen into the   and lay it then the egg breaks in the abdomen and gets rotten. If this happens then the bird is in danger and has to go undergo surgery to remove the egg. Also, if the egg breaks, the uterus ruptures,” said Dr  , avian specialist.
 
 Egg binding is said to occur when a bird suffers from lack of calcium. 
 
 “Calcium injection was given so that the pulse contracts and helps the bird to descend the egg and lay it. The African love bird was given medication for four days and when the egg was slightly seen, I removed it manually,” added Dev.
 
 Experts said that when a bird has an egg in the abdomen, it is kept under observation for four to five days and if she is straining, showing discomfort then the egg is removed. “Usually the bird owners do not realise that the bird has an egg in the abdomen as it bulges, they mistake it for a tumour or a swelling,” claimed Dev.
