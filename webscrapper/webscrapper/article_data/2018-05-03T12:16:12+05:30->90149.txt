BHANGAR: Residents of   village near Rajarhat don’t have free access to the adjoining Haroa Road — used by those who go to schools, colleges and offices — since April 4. Trees have been felled to block a road near Taoban, forcing villagers to take a 6km detour every day to access Haroa Road.

 
 No one dares to remove the barricade after those who tried were “thrashed and fined” by   men. Villagers bear the brunt for contesting the rural polls as independents, against Trinamool. Calcutta High Court’s recognizing all nine online nominations, including three others earlier, has left the Arabul brigade fuming.
 
 “We have written to the DM, lodged complaint with SP and intimated the Eastern Frontier Rifles camp near Power Grid. They haven’t responded yet,” said Save Land, Livelihood, Home & Environment Committee secretary Mirza Hasan.
 
 The barricade was lifted for a few hours on Wednesday morning to let some vehicles head to a local wedding. “It was relaxed as the family satisfied the local Trinamool toughs,” a local said. But the barricade won’t shift to make way for   student Tuhina Parveen. “I don’t want to antagonize them and just take a few extra kilometres,” she said.
 
 However, taking the detour isn’t possible for vegetable vendors or petty traders carrying items to Notun Hat. The biweekly market there has taken a hit with a slump in trade.
 
 Trinamool leader   denied the charge. “I don’t know who put up this barricade. My men don’t have a hand in it,” said Arabul.
