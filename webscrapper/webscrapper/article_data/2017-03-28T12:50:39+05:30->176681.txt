NEW DELHI: Five people were arrested today in connection with the assault on four   yesterday, Noida police said, according to ANI.

 "Police have arrested 5 persons. FIR registered, action will be taken accordingly,"said Daljeet Chaudhary, assistant director general (law and order), to ANI.
 
 One of the assaulted students spoke to the media today.
 
 "We asked people around for help, but not one called the police. Even our college did not help,"the student said.
 
 Uttar Pradesh's chief minister   this morning promised a "fair investigation" of the incident.
 
 "Attack on Nigerian students (is) a serious issue. Proper probe will be done. Report will be provided to centre at earliest," said UP minister S Nath.
 
 It all began when a Class 12 student died, allegedly of a drug overdose. The neighbourhood the students live in has many African students residing there as well, as there are many educational institutions in the Noida and   regions. 
 
 In keeping with the stereotype that "Nigerians sell drugs", locals immediately began suspecting that some of the "Nigerian" sold the drugs to the Class 12 student who dies. Later, police even arrested five Nigerian students but then released them for lack of evidence. 
 
 After they were released, the residents, beat up four of them. They also demanded all Africans living in residential colonies in Greater Noida be asked to vacate their rented houses.
