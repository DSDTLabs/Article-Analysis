 Along with attending the grand ceremony, the two have also scheduled meetings with international filmmakers for prospective projects. Speaking of the Oscars, Ali’s historical drama, 'Victoria & Abdul', has bagged two nominations (Makeup-Hairstyling and Costume Design) this year, so the day will be special for the actor, who will reunite with co-star Judi Dench at the ceremony.
