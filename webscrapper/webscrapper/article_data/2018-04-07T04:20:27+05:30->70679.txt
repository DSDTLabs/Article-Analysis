MUMBAI: Four men were   on Wednesday for allegedly cloning debit/ credit cards by installing a skimmer at ATMs in   in Lower Parel. 

 The police said that while many employees from corporate offices had become victims, a senior official of a multi national bank had lodged a complaint that led to the gang being busted.
 
 The arrested   (20), Mohammed Gazarwale (30),   (31) and NisarShaikh (28)-have been booked for cheating, said an official from NM Joshi Marg police station. "We suspect the involvement of some foreigners," said the official. 
 
 The police said that the gang members used to to stick skimmers on ATMs which would retrieve the magnetic data of the card and the password. Using that data, they would then make duplicate cards with which they would siphon off money.
 
 The police said that four other people had been cheated of Rs1, 24,000. "As the number of people who were cheated grew, we realised that almost all clients were from corporate offices at Kamala Mills campus. We got images from   footage which helped us nab one of the gang members. This one led us to the others," said the officer. 
 
 Another police officer said, "It appears the four were guided well on how to skim and clone cards. We suspect some well-informed people were backing up. these men." - S Ahmed Ali
