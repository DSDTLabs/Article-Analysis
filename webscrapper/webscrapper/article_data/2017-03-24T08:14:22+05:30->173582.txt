Punjab government had agreed that the airport will be named after  , (but) the Haryana government, the Haryana chief minister said 'no'. They want to name the airport after Mangal Sein," he said, adding that there were agitations on Wednesday for naming the airport after Bhagat Singh. 

 Joining the issue,   MP Partap Singh Bajwa said on one side there was demand to name the airport after the great freedom fighter but on the other hand,   wanted to name it after the party's ex-chief minister. Bajwa also demand that two-minute silence be observed on every March 23 before starting the business of the House.
 
 As several opposition MPs were up on their feet and created an uproar, junior parliamentary affairs'minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi countered the allegations and said, "We have never said it and nobody has said it. It's not proper to make such sweeping statements".
 
 The minister said Bhagat Singh was a martyr and was respected by everyone. Not convinced with the response, leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad asked the Centre whether or not it has decided to name the airport after Bhagat Singh.
