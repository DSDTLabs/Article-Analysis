Thane: The anti-extortion cell has arrested a mason for possessing counterfeit notes of Rs 2 lakh face value.

 The accused, Prakash Mahato (42), was trapped by a team led by inspector Rajkumar Kothmire near Dnyansadhna College late on Tuesday evening. Kothmire said that they had received a tip-off that Mahato was planning to pump fake currency. Cops used a decoy to catch Mahato red-handed. 
 
 “Mahato hails from Hazaribagh in Jharkhand and was residing in Wagle Estate locality,” added sub-inspector Hemant Dhole.
 
 During the course of interrogation, the police found that Mahato had been earlier arrested by Barkatha police station, Hazaribagh in 2013 with Rs 37,000 in counterfeit currency. After securing bail, “Mahato took up work in Wagle Estate, and during his visits to Hazaribagh, he would contact one Hemlal Pandit who would give him the consignment. Mahato was promised a commission if he managed to distribute the fake currency,” said sub-inspector Sandesh Gawand. “The notes seem to be of good quality. We will seek assistance from various agencies to ascertain the source,” said Kothmire
