GAYA: Pensioners have outnumbered regular employees in Magadh University ( ). According to official figures, whereas the number of regular employees, teaching as well as non-teaching is 3,729, the number of pensioners is 4,103. Of the 3,279 regular employees, 1,412 are teachers, while the number of working non-teaching employees is 2,317.

 As per available estimates, in the next five years, more than 70% of working employees will join the rank of pensioners thereby tilting the scale heavily in favour of the pensioners. As, except for nearly 200 recently appointed assistant professors and the 128 lecturers appointed in 2003, all appointments to the teaching posts were made more than 25 years back and all these employees now fast approach the age of superannuation. The average age of MU teachers is estimated to be more than 55 years.
 
 The 128 teachers conditionally appointed in 2003 continue to be haunted by vigilance probe as the ongoing inquiry into alleged bungling in appointments has not yet been completed. The then VC Abhimaniyu Singh was reluctant to make the controversial appointments. He is believed to have been pressurised into making the appointments and in order to protect himself, Abhimaniyu Singh subjected the appointments to the final outcome of the vigilance inquiry.
 
 A sizeable number of recently appointed NET qualified assistant professors, according to Federation of University Teachers Association Bihar (FUTAB) president Kanhaiya Bahadur Sinha, are looking for jobs outside the state on account of irregular and somewhat uncertain salary payment.
 
 The last pay packet received by MU employees was for September 2017. Most the new appointees are from outside the state and the Biharis who managed to get teaching jobs in MU have got higher education outside the state. The number of products of state universities clearing NET is said to be minuscule, more so in subjects like physics, chemistry, mathematics, botany and zoology.
