NAGPUR: Supreme Court’s bench comprising Justices   and RF Nariman on Friday issued notices to the respondents in all seven cases of Dabba scam in the special leave petition (SLP) filed by Nagpur police’s Economic offence wing challenging the high court order. The notices are returnable in two weeks. 

 The notices were issued to accused   and others after the SLP was admitted in the apex court. The Maharastra state, represented by Attorney general of India Mukul Rohatgi, had argued for a stay on the   order questioning the power of the police to register a FIR in the Dabba scam case or even to make arrest without being a legal complainant or competent authority to do so in the matters under Securities contract regulation Act. The apex court learnt to have turned down the argument of the state to allow stay on the order granting anticipatory bail. The SC was in the opinion to to consider the matter further on the point of law.
