TRICHY:   following an announcement from the state government, but only less than half the students could attend classes. While many wanted to express solidarity with the student  , others could not make it to the colleges from far-off places as the announcement on reopening came late in the evening.

 “We had announced closure of hostels from Friday which made students go back to their native districts. Since the bus and rail services were affected, the students could not get back as the announcement came late on Sunday. Only 60 per cent of the students could make it to the college on Monday,” said Principal of St Joseph’s College S Andrew. Principal of Periyar EVR College J Manjula said that the student strength indeed was poor. “Uncertainty also prevailed on the direction in which the protest was heading,” she said. 
 
 While a section of students believe that uncertainly still prevails, they do not see a permanent solution in the emergency ordinance brought by the state government. Amendment to the PCA Act can be the only way out, believes A Kodainila, a PG student of history at  . “Our academic performance would certainly get affected if we don’t go to college but we couldn’t leave Tamil cause either,” she says. 
 
 Led by youth, especially college students, the pro-jallikattu protest gained shape on Wednesday when classes were barely attended by students who started gathering at the protest venue. While there was an overwhelming increase in the numbers the next day, the colleges announced closure on Friday. The state government on Sunday evening ordered re-opening of the colleges following the emergency ordinance.
 
 K Pandian, former president of   (AUT), said the violence would have shocked the students. “They wouldn’t have thought that the protest that was led by them in a peaceful manner would witness violence. The way the protest was being led by the young minds drew people from all walks of life but later it shifted from its core objective,”he said.
