AGRA: Barely hours after   (HYV) issued a 48-hour ultimatum to Aligarh Muslim University Students’ Union (AMUSU) to remove a portrait of Pakistan founder   from the students’ hall, right wing activists clashed with university students while attempting to force their way into the campus to remove the portrait on Wednesday. 

 
 Police later carried out lathicharge and fired tear gas shells at the protesting students. Slogan-shouting members of Hindu Jagran Manch, HYV and   (ABVP) were challenged by AMU students when the former tried to make their way into the campus to forcibly remove the portrait. AMU students armed with sticks reached the gate and confronted the activists. 
 
 Shortly afterwards, police resorted to lathicharge and fired tear gas shells to disperse nearly 1,000 AMU students marching to the police station. They were demanding cases against the activists, as well as BJP MP Satish Gautam who had raised the issue in the first place. UP DGP OP Singh said, “The situation is under control but moderate force had to be used to disperse the students as the situation could have worsened.” 
 
 Meanwhile, asserting that   is not a role model for Indian Muslims, minority affairs minister   on Wednesday said he was confident that the “patriotic” AMU administration and the students would resolve the row with a “sensitive approach”, PTI reported. Naqvi also said things have “changed” in India after 1938, when Jinnah was accorded life membership of the AMU students' union.
