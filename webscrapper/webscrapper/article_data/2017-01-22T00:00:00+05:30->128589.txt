In a show of solidarity with our neighbouring state, Bengalureans gathered in large numbers in areas across the city such as Town Hall, Electronic City and Ulsoor to raise their voices against the ban on jallikattu. This coincided with the stir in  , where protests have been going on for nearly a week. 

 The people of   put aside their differences with Tamil Nadu (in lieu of the decades-long Cauvery water sharing issue) and thronged city streets, holding posters that read “we want jallikattu”, “support jallikattu” and “save our culture”. Around 1,000 people assembled in front of Town Hall itself on Thursday, where the crowd largely consisted of techies and students.
 
 
 
 
 An offshoot of Friday’s protest was that many Bengalureans, who wanted to either come back to the city from Tamil Nadu or those who planned on going there, had to change their travel plans in the last minute. There were also those, like danseuse  , who left Chennai to come to Bengaluru by the Double Decker Express at 7.30 am on Friday, but could not make it to the city that day. “The train left from   on time and the expected time of arrival at   was 12.30 pm. At 8.15 am, the train suddenly came to a halt just after the Putlur station. We were stranded in the middle of nowhere and there was a line of trains in front of and behind us. We were there till around 4 pm, after which the train moved a little and reached Thiruvallur station. In the evening, we were told that our train would take us till  , where a   was waiting to take us to Bengaluru. But, at 7.45 pm, we got a message from IRCTC, informing us that our train had been cancelled and that we should make alternate arrangements. By then, the local trains had begun to ply, so all of us — young and old — made our way to Chennai Central. Many people took the night bus back to Bengaluru, but my family was worried that there could be some unrest, so I booked a flight for Bengaluru for Saturday evening,” she says.
