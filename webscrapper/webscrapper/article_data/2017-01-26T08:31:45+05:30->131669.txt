GANDHINAGAR: To reach out to rural voters in the crucial election year, chief minister Vijay Rupani-led government is banking on former CM Anandiben Patel’s forgotten flagship project Mukhyamantri Gram Sadak Yojna (MGSY). To woo voters during panchayat elections, Anandiben had announced the launch of MGSY. However, after her exit the scheme was put on the back-burner by the new administration. But the December   have made the state government aggressively push for new road networks. Originally, Rs 2,500 crore was allocated for the project. But the government has now approved Rs 4,272.41 crore and plans have already been cleared for 14,486 km of road work. 

  A key official aware of the development said that of the total 4,741 road work tenders, around 3,000 have already been approved and work orders have been issued. Technical clearance for almost all the work has been given and the remaining tenders will be finalized within a month. Though little progress had been made on the ground since the announcement of the scheme earlier, major work is likely to start in a few days across the state. 
 
 “All these roads are expected to be completed within the next few months,” the official said.
