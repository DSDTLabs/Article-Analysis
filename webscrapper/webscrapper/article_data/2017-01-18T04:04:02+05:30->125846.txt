Ghaziabad: A 27-year-old female instructor employed at a gym in   has alleged that she was being harassed by two people, including a   inspector, for many months.

 The complainant approached   on Tuesday to file a second FIR against her alleged tormentors. Her earlier FIR was filed on November 5 but she alleged that she was forced to approach the police yet again as there was an ‘inexplicable’ delay on the part of the police to act while her alleged tormentors continued to harass her.
 
 The police, on their part, said since the case entailed sending of an objectionable remark to the woman’s   account it has been referred to the cyber crime cell, which is investigating the matter.
 
 The two accused have been identified as Rinku Yadav and Vijaypal, who is an inspector with CRPF, and have been named in the November 5 FIR. 
 
 Vijaypal told TOI that he and Rinku were being framed by gym owner Vinod, who happens to be Vijaypal’s cousin. Vijaypal alleged that the woman was acting at the behest of Vinod, who wants to settle family scores with him.
 
 The woman said Rinku had started stalking her eight months ago when she joined the gym as an instructor. “His overtures worsened with time,” the woman said. 
 
 “The November 5 FIR proved counterproductive as I started getting overt threats from them and on one occasion Rinku barged into my gym with his uncle, Vijaypal, and threatened me,” she said, adding that Vijaypal posted objectionable post on her FB account.
