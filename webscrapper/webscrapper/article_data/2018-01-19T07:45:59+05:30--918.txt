BAMBOLIM:   minister for commerce and Industry   on Thursday said that recycling of metals for further reuse in the industrial sector was vital for the country’s sustainable economic growth. Prabhu, speaking through video, assured the metal recycling industry that his ministry was ready to provide the necessary support.

Modi also stressed on the need to “build a common platform for getter cooperation and synergy of the stakeholders” of the recycling industry.
 
  Union minister for steel   said that the recycling industry should be considered as separate industry.
