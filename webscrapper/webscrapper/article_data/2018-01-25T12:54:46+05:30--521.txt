PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The standing committee has approved a resolution to give free drinking water up to 6,000 litres per connection from April 1, 2018, chairperson   said. 

 The civic administration drew up a proposal to increase the water tax rates and put it up for the the standing committeeâ€™s approval on Wednesday. It had proposed to increase charges to Rs 4 per 1,000 litres from the prevailing rates of Rs 2.5 per 1,000 litres for 6,000 litres per month. 
 
 Savale and other committee members said the hike proposed by the civic administration is too high. Civic officials said the expenditure on water supply is huge as compared to the income through water tax.
 
 The annual expenditure on water supply is Rs 109 crore for lifting raw water from   bund on   river, purification, supplying it to consumers, preparing bills as per water meter readings and distribution of bills. The civic administration expects to earn Rs 34 crore annually from water tax but only receives around Rs 25 to 26 crore. As a result, the civic body suffers an annual loss of around Rs 80 to 85 crore.
 
 The committee approved a resolution for charging Rs 8 per 1,000 litres for monthly water consumption from 6,001 to 15,000 litres; Rs 12.5 per 1,000 litres for monthly water consumption from 15,001 to 22,500 litres; Rs 20 per 1,000 litres for monthly water consumption from 22,501 to 30,000 litres.
 
 The civic administration had proposed charges of Rs 50 per 1,000 litres for hotel, restaurant and shops; Rs 15 per 1,000 litres for private educational organisations, government and semi-government offices, railway stations, hospitals and hostels; Rs 10 per 1,000 litres for religious places, orphanages, old age homes, mandals operating on no loss no profit basis and authorized by charity commissioner while Rs 20 per 1,000 litres for stadiums.
