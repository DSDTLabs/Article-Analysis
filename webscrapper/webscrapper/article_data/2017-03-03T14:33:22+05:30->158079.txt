CALANGUTE: Calangute BJP MLA   said the issue of the proposed national   was never discussed in the assembly nor in the cabinet.

 He said, on Thursday, that though the   of road transport and highways had sent a proposal to declare certain major district roads (MDRs) as highways so as to allocate funds for their upgradation, the Goa government would never agree to the proposal.
 
 “This was never discussed in the assembly nor the cabinet. The PWD might have written to the Centre for funds to upgrade the road network, and the Centre has agreed to sanction funds if the roads are declared as highways as, then, they would come under the  , which falls within the purview of the ministry,” he said.
 
 Lobo pointed out that none of the MLAs supports the proposal. “In fact, in Calangute, we have changed the MDR that runs from Sinquerim to Arpora, to a village road in the draft outline development plan (ODP) for Calangute, and a final notification will be issued by the new government. So there is no question of any highway in Calangute. It is impractical to change the MDRs into highways in Goa as there are a large number of old houses and shops which would have to be demolished, and this will never be done,” Lobo, who was formerly chairman of the   (NGPDA), said.
 
 “Take the new Zuari bridge; we are building the bridge from the Holy Cross at Bambolim right up to Verna, so that none of the houses along the way have to be demolished. This government will never go against the wishes of the people of Goa,” he said.
