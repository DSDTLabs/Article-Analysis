CHANDIGARH: Heated exchanges between the treasury benches and Opposition marked the second day of the Punjab budget session. Congress Gidderbaha MLA   Raja Warring and Leader of Opposition   indulged in a war of words with the former raising the issue of apology by AAP supremo  . Earlier, SAD's Bikram Majithia slugged it out with Congress' Sukhjinder   and welfare minister   on alleged non-disbursal of funds under the shagun scheme. 

 Interestingly, Sunam AAP MLA Aman Arora reminded Warring of an apology by chief minister Amarinder Singh to Himachal BJP leader Prem Kumar Dhumal in 2013. Warring said that, "Their (AAP's) Delhi leader kept looking for the right words for tendering an apology for the past one year. Don't show double standards." Referring to Khaira, he said, "Your leader is apologizing but you are not putting in your papers because you know that it will be accepted by your party leadership."
 
 "Someone who has been summoned by a court has been asking those facing allegations on sand mines to resign. You resign from your post and face the trial," said Warring. Khaira retorted, "Are you not aware of the law? The summons has been stayed and the matter is subjudice. I am willing to face a probe by the CBI or any other agency," he said. Warring added that before the probe you must resign.
 
 Warring said, "Former irrigation minister Rana Gurjit had resigned merely on the basis of allegations. AAP seeks resignation on any issue," he said .
 
 During question hour, Majithia was not satisfied by welfare minister Sadhu Singh Dharamsot's reply on funds distributed under the shagun scheme. He wanted to know the number of beneficiaries between March, 2017, and December, 2017.
