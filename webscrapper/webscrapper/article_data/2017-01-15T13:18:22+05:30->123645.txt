PANAJI:   have started the hunt for a new coach after ending their three-year association with Zico.

 The club said in a press release on Saturday: “FC Goa and its head coach for the past three seasons, Mr   (Zico), have mutually decided against exercising the option of extending the contract. Keeping the logistical challenges of the upcoming season in mind, the two parties amicably came to this decision.
 
 The former Japan and Iran coach had a successful stint in the Indian Super League with FC Goa, taking the Goan side to the semifinals in the inaugural edition and a final appearance at home the next year where they lost to   conceding two goals in the last 3 minutes.
 
 Last season was a disaster for FC Goa after they only finished at the bottom of the pool, leaving the club with no choice but part ways with the much-respected Brazilian legend.
 
 “The FC Goa management has nothing but immense respect and gratitude towards Zico and his dedicated support staff for their role in helping the club establish its foundation. Zico will always retain a special place in the club’s history,” the release added.
 
 The release revealed that the club is in the process of appointing a technical director with relevant coaching experience and scouting knowledge within the country’s footballing ecosystem. 
 
 “FC Goa strongly feels that this would be an important step in laying the foundations for the long term, and help achieve sustainable growth of the club and Indian players. Over time, the club is keen to ensure that the dependency on foreign players is limited and this in turn will give Indian players the platform to make the biggest impact. 
 
 “FC Goa has always strived to be a club belonging to every Goan, and will continue the legacy of binding Goa through the realms of the beautiful game,” the statement concluded.
