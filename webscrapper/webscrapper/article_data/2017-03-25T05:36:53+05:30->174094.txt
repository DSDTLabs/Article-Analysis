AHMEDABAD: A 26-year-old   ( ) jawan with Isanpur   and his friend were beaten black and blue when he went to   late on Thursday night. Riverfront (W) police nabbed all five accused in the case on Friday.

    Prashant Lakhan was off duty on Thursday and went with his friends to Riverfront Park that evening. When he checked his trousers after dinner for his wallet, he realized it was not there. He decided to check near the public toilet at the riverfront.
 
 “He and his friend Govind Prajapati went to the spot at 11.30 pm where Gopal Vaghela and four other security guards were there. He was stopped by Vaghela. Lakhan identified himself as a policeman. This angered Vaghela and the altercation resulted in fisticuffs. The four others also started beating Lakhan and Prajapati with batons,” said an investigator.
 
 The duo had to flee, leaving Lakhan’s mobile phone behind. J A Bhagora, inspector of Riverfront (W) police station, said Lakhan’s complaint was taken at VS Hospital.
