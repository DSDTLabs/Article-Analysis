BIJNOR: Sharpening his attack on the ruling party, RLD vice-president   on Sunday said that if the BJP wins, it will be a defeat for the entire farming community. Chaudhary was addressing a rally at poll-bound Noorpur constituency in Bijnor.
 
  “Prime Minister   has deceived the farmers by making false promises. Ahead of 2017 assembly elections,   had asked for votes in the name of former PM   and promised all round development to the people of Bijnor. But nothing has been done on the ground. This time around, we should be careful and unite to stop the BJP,” the RLD leader said.
  
  Lashing out at the state government, he said, “The BJP-led state government had promised to farmers that it would get their sugarcane dues cleared within 14 day of purchasing of crop. However, the government has failed to do so. Over Rs12,000 crore are currently pending and the farmers are having a tough time in running their households. How will they cultivate their crop if they do not have enough to feed their children or send them to school? Farmers are reeling under debt. The government has increased the electricity bills for tubewells. It is time for farmers to hit back.”
  
  Urging the local voters, Chaudhary said, “If we want to save democracy, we will have to unite to give a befitting reply to the BJP government.” Former UP minister  , state general secretary of RLD, Rahul Singh and SP MLA Manoj Paras were present at the rally.
