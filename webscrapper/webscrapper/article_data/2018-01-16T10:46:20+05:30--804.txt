SURAT: Varachha police on Monday arrested a 24-year-old man for allegedly raping a four-year-old girl at his house. The accused Krishna Sanjay Paswan allegedly raped the girl when she had gone to his room to watch TV on Sunday. 

 Paswan works as a labourer in a textile shop and lives in Varachha. The rape survivor’s mother first noticed that the girl was injured when she returned. She even countered Paswan but he attacked her too. On noticing the ruckus, other residents rushed to their house and thrashed Paswan on getting to know about the sexual assault. They also called police which arrested Paswan. The girl was sent to hospital for medical examination. 
 
 “We are investigating the case. If required, we will seek his custody when we produce him in court on Tuesday,” said police.
