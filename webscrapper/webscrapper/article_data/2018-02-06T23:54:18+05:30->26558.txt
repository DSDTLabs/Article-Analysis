Hyderabad: Power transmission infrastructure developer   on Tuesday said it has commissioned two transmission lines in Telangana — the 400KV D/C Nizamabad-Shankarapally and 400KV Maheshwaram-Mahbubnagar lines — well ahead of schedule. 

 Maheshwaram Transmission Ltd will build, own, operate and maintain the two lines with a total line length of 236 km for 35 years. “The project allows a 1000MW incremental capacity of power offtake and these lines are an integral part of the Telangana government’s plans to ensure adequacy of the system to provide reliable and quality power to the consumers in the state,” Sterlite Power said in a statement.
 
 Commenting on the development, Ved Tiwari, CEO, global infrastructure BU, Sterlite Power, said, “Telangana has embarked on a timely journey to upgrade its transmission system towards meeting the projected peak load of over 21,000 MW up to FY 2018-19 and RE power of about 6,016 MW. These lines augment the power offtake capacity by almost 1000 MW and should help in addressing the increase of household consumption to 3.56 units/ day in FY 2018-19.” 
 
 Sterlite Power has 13 projects of nearly 8000 circuit kms spanning India and Brazil.
