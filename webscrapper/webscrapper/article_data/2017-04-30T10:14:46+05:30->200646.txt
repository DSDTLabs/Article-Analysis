CHENNAI: It was a day of indecision for the AIADMK faction led by   on Saturday. Having decided to make an important announcement (calling off the merger talks) late on Friday, the group called for a press meet at 11.30 am on Saturday. 

 But senior leaders, who went into a huddle around 11am, chose to put off the media briefing to 2 pm. Finally, it was cancelled as a few leaders prevailed upon OPS to get more feedback from cadres before taking any such decision. 
 
 "We wanted to speak to the media in the afternoon, but before that we wanted to know what cadres feel about the proposed merger talks. So we decided to buy more time," said a leader at the meeting.
 
 "As of now, only Mettur MLA   has met the cadres. At a meeting he convened in Salem on Friday, party cadres urged the OPS camp to call off merger talks as they felt any truck with the ruling faction will be a burden for OPS," said a leader. "We cannot take a stand based on what cadres in Salem say. We need to hear from cadres in other regions as well," said former minister  
 
 "Most of the leaders who took part in the meeting were not interested in holding talks unless the government announced CBI probe into Jayalalithaa's death and the   expelled V K Sasikala and T T V Dhinakaran," said the leader. OPS should be made CM, said another. The meeting also discussed plans to celebrate MGR's centenary. The first function will be held at R K Nagar on May 1.
 
 Rajya Sabha member   said the Edappadi camp had a tacit understanding with Sasikala and Dhinakaran and pointed to the additional affidavits submitted before the EC as proof. In the affidavits, Sasikala is referred to as general secretary and Dhinakaran as her deputy.
 
 "We only want the expulsion of Sasikala and her family. We never asked for general secretary post or any other post ," said Ponnaiyan.
