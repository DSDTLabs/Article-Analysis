MOHALI: Ten drug examiners of Kharar’s Punjab State Chemical Laboratory are guilty of   samples to help many peddlers get away during the trial stage in October 2013.

 The facility operates from the premises of the state  , food and chemical testing laboratory. While these men will get their quantum of sentence on March 21, their lawyer, B S Sohal, said here on Thursday that “another six were acquitted for want of evidence”.
 
  
  
 
 Those guilty are assistant chemical examiner Rajinder Singh, computer operator Parveen Arora, former technician Gurjant Singh, assistant laboratory attendant  , former helper Darshan Singh, laboratory technician Lekh Raj, former assistant chemical examiner  , and Punjab Police constables Ashwani Kumar, Rakesh Kumar, and Hardev Singh. Those acquitted are Karu Lal, Vinay Kumar, Sandeep Singh, advocate Harish Ahuja, Charanjit Singh, and Rajesh Mishra. 
 
 Punjab Vigilance Bureau had registered a case against these chemical examiners, analysts, and cops for irregularities in the testing of samples to hamper proceedings of trial courts. In one case, police had seized 98 liquor bottles of 8 costly brands at Mohali and sent these over to the laboratory for analysis. Without any sampling or analysis, the experts returned a negative report and misappropriated the bottles.
 
 Some of the viscera samples sent to the laboratory in 2015 were still pending for analysis. It is not possible to provide accurate reports about these old samples after two years. In another case, the laboratory assistants had destroyed a case property from   without examination. Because of experts’ widespread criminal misconduct in analyzing drug samples, many drug convictions have been dismissed. The investigators contaminated drug samples, falsified results, and mishandled evidence.
