PUNE: The   on Monday reclaimed 107 hectares of prime forest land at   from the revenue authorities, in   for almost 115 years.

 The reclaimed land is a part of the 35,182 hectare reserved land that the forest department had given to the revenue authorities way back in 1902 for management till 2008. Once this this period was over, the government had issued orders for the forest department to reclaim the land. Of this, 20,890 hectare forest land was reclaimed over the last nine years and the remaining was to be handed over by December 2016.
 
 The process to recover 14,292 hectare was proving to be tedious since the revenue department had distributed 11,349 hectare among private parties before 1980 when the Forest Conservation Act came into force. This Act prevents transfer of forest land for any other purpose. Now, the remaining land is being reclaimed by the forest department.
 
 “There are issues of encroachment. So it is not very easy for the district administration to hand over the land immediately. We reclaimed 107 hectares of land amid police protection as there was severe opposition from parties using it for stone quarrying. Now that the land belongs to us, we will start the afforestation activity soon,” forest officials said.
 
 The state has set afforestation target at 33% by 2019 under the Union government’s social forestry programme. Presently, the state has 20% and Pune has only 14% forest cover, the officials said, adding that the objective of reclaiming the land was to increase afforestation activity. 
 
 Statistics indicate that 61.35 lakh hectares of the total 307 lakh hectares in the state have forest cover. Around 400 crore trees will have to be planted to meet the 2019 target.
 
 The forest department is yet to recover 2.5 hectare which has been encroached upon. “We had to take back land minus the encroachment,” a district forest official said. 
 
 The forest department also expected to get back 2,944 hectares of reserved forest land from  , the officials said.
