Her screen persona could make her look cute and petite, but   says that she is not as fragile as she comes across. In fact, the ' ' actress asserts that she can pounce on anyone who rubs her the wrong way. And, she is always eager to contribute towards women’s empowerment. 

 With eve-teasing on the rise, Nushrat recently met a group of 50 young girls from Mumbai’s slums, to make them aware of self-defence and safety. During the meeting, which was also attended by martial arts experts, she too learnt a few techniques that could be used to tackle eve-teasers.
 
 Nushrat says, “I explained to the girls how self-defence is the need of the hour. Also, it’s not just about physical prowess. As women, we need to know that we can overpower anyone with our mental strength. One should be alert and know how to defend oneself in case something untoward happens.”
 
 Talking about herself, Nushrat recalls, “Since childhood, I was always told that I am petite and can get hurt easily. And I always felt the need to become physically strong, just to prove people wrong. I briefly studied martial arts in college and realised that I might not be a great fighter physically, but it gave me mental strength and boosted my confidence.” Nushrat feels the experience also made her stronger and independent, while also helping her approach tough characters with ease and comfort. “It helps me bring my A-game to the table while people try to instill doubts in my mind about my talent,” she says.
