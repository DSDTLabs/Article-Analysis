KOCHI: Aluva MLA Anwar   on Friday said he has not entered into any financial or land dealings with actor  , who has been arrested on conspiracy charges in the actor rape case.

 The MLA admitted that Dileep was a good friend and that he had called him several times after the incident occurred.
 
 When asked about the unusual number of calls on the days following the crime, the MLA said he had called him in the morning on the day the incident took place and doesn't remember whether Dileep called back or not. “I was trying to call Dileep during the days before the incident as well. I wanted to request for his presence at a school inauguration of a friend of mine and was trying to reach him on the phone but his phone was switched off. I had contacted him the morning on the day the incident occurred and he answered the call. I told him about the inauguration and later discussed the incident as it was on the news. He told me he also came to know about it,“ said Sadath at a press conference here.
 
 He said the police could have called him anytime to enquire about his connection with Dileep. “I am ready to cooperate with any kind of investigation. If my friend Dileep is guilty, he should be given apt punishment,“ said Sadath.
 
 The politician maintained that he had called Dileep multiple times while the probe was going on and he repeated that he does not have any kind of involvement in the incident. “I had called him even when that `selfie' was doing the rounds and he told me that he has never met `Pulsar' Suni and that he doesn't even know him. When I last talked to him before going abroad, he told me pointing at the Shiva temple that he is innocent,“ said the MLA.
 
 When asked whether the probe was going on in the right direction, he said everyone seems to think so. “Everyone seems to think that the probe is going on in the right direction and I don't have a different opinion,“ said the MLA.
