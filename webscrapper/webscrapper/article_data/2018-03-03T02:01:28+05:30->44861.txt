MUMBAI: A 35-year-old Jodhpur resident was arrested on Thursday for making   to the chairman of a group of companies, residing in Bandra (W). A police team who posed as villagers and stayed in Rajasthan traced Ramyal Rathod, who threatened to bump off   Products Ltd’s Prafulla Bhat if he did not pay Rs 2 crore. 

 Police said Rathod, through an accomplice, handed over a letter to Bhat that he was not afraid of killing him as he had killed two others in the past few years in Rajasthan. 
 
 Bhat paid Rs 7 lakh but the gang kept demanding more. The victim received at least three dozen calls on his mobile since September 2017.
 
 Bandra police in February arrested Rathod’s accomplices Yusuf Khan (35) and   (26), who collected Rs 5 lakh ransom on behalf of Rathod, after threatening to get Bhat trapped in illegal cases after publishing a false story on their news portal www.thetrap24x7.com. Bhat’s company deals with electronics, renewable energy and textiles and is exploring services in Europe.
 
 Senior inspector Pandit Thakare said they were collecting information on who provided Rathod with Bhat’s profile details.
 
 A non-cognizable offence was registered at   police on October 11 after Bhat’s employee received a threat at the Lower Parel office. Bhat was called to a Kalbadevi hotel on January 10, where he was told to hand Rs 2 lakh to a courier boy. This helped police find out that the money was handed over to Rathod at Rajasthan.
 
 Rathod is in police custody till March 5.
