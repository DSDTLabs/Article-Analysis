MYSURU/HUBBALLI: Chief minister   on Saturday said he has to first explore the legal and constitutional options before taking any decision on granting independent religion status to the   community. While political circles described his stand as a 'go-slow approach' being adopted in the backdrop of allegations that the   was attempting to divide the community for political reasons, a section of the community chose to intensify its demand for a separate religious tag. 

  Several   scholars, leaders and politicians attended a meeting convened in Hubballi by JD(S) legislator and former minister Basavaraj Horatti and passed a resolution demanding separate religious status for Lingayats. They decided to submit a representation to the CM and also hold a massive rally in Hubballi to demand a separate religion. 
 
  Lingayat scholar N G   said: "The Veerashaiva religion has no founder but Lingayats have   as the founder. Vachana is literature of Lingayat religion but there is no mention of the word 'Veerashaiva' in it. Basavanna critized yajnas as they are performed only by Brahmins and he tried to provide right to worship to everyone, irrespective of caste and creed. Veerashaiva belief promotes caste-based hierarchy and discriminates work. Lingayats cannot be part of such Veerashaiva or Vedic religion," he said. 
 
 Though JD(S) has been neutral on the issue, Horatti said he intervened as Lingayats had been at the receiving end.
