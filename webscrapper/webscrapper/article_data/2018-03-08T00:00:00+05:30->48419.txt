After tying the knot,   Verma and Rani threw a lavish reception for their friends and family. Jatin’s parents,   and his wife Usha, looked elated to have a new member in the family. The couple was also spotted looking after the arrangements and greeting the guests at the entrance. Jatin’s sister Neetu looked pretty in a traditional blue coloured attire and also received many compliments for her look. 
Several party regulars also marked their presence to bless the newlyweds. 
 The highlight of the reception was a qawwali performance by   and Sad Warsi, who came from Hyderabad. The duo also sang Bollywood numbers like Dulhe Ka Sehra, Mere Rashq-e-Qamar, Mubarak Ho Tumko, etc.
