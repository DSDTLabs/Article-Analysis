GURUGRAM: The state government will soon bring in a new education act that will focus on safety, infrastructure, curriculum, etc in schools. The draft act is being formulated in collaboration with FICCI and a Karnataka-based firm.

 Officials said the act prescribes multiple deterrents and penalties for schools that violate safety norms. The government has already issued instructions to schools across the state for the safety of children, following the murder of seven-year-old Pradhyumn Thakur at Ryan International School in Bhondsi.
 
 According to additional chief secretary of the school education department, KK Khandelwal, the new act being framed for the safety of children will cover all government, private, aided and unaided schools in Haryana.
 
 “The act will be a sort of an examining body to set standards for all schools. In fact, various stakeholders such as government and private schools, educationists, social activists, apart from the Karnataka-based firm and FICCI, are involved in the preparation of the draft act,” he told TOI.
 
 The new education bill will be introduced in the next monsoon session of the Haryana assembly, officials said.
 
 “The existing act has only some strict provisions like de-recognition of a school etc. However, the new version of the act will have deterrents too such as suspending the powers of a school principal, reducing school fees if facilities are not provided etc,” said Khandelwal.
 
 Officials said a separate wing will also be established in the education department by the state government to deal will all private school-related issues. 
 
 Under the new act, a three-level safety committee at district, sub division and school will be formed and headed by the deputy commissioner, sub-divisional magistrate and school head, respectively. The new rules will also introduce third party inspections in schools, with the sub-divisional magistrate as the nodal officer for the same, officials
