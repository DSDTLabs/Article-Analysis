The gorgeous sari can never go out of fashion. The traditional weave and style of the sari still remains classic, while many designers have offered a whole new way to wear a sari. Even the leading ladies of Bollywood can't seem to get over this trend. From Rekha's breathtaking saris to Kangana's casual saris, the B-town divas keeps inspiring us to wear saris in classic style and also refreshing new ways.

 
 
 The one sari look that recently caught our attention was of Deepika Padukone. She was seen wearing a georgette sari featuring bold white and red stripes. She paired the striped sari with a black blouse, which also had embroidered metallic details on the hem. The designer behind this gorgeous sari is none other than, Sabyasachi Mukherjee, who has been designing breathtaking saris for Deepika over and over again.

 This sari is a sneak peek from the label's Spring Summer 2018 collection. Looking at this sari, we're already considering saris for summer. We also loved the white belt detail, which gave the sari drape a chic look. For this look, Deepika went for a bold red lip colour and her usual, slicked-back bun. What do you think about this particular look? Let us know in the comments section below:
