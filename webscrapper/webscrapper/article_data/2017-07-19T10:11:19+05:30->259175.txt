Mumbai: With the reconstitution of the overseeing committee for debt resolution by the  , industry players expect speedy settlement of the   (NPAs) of defaulters from the expanded list. This list includes 488 companies, other than the 12 largest ones that were recommended by the central bank’s panel.

 Earlier this year, the RBI’s internal advisory committee ( ) had prepared a list of 500 companies of which 12 cases were to be sent directly to the National Company Law Tribunal ( ). In the remaining 488 cases, banks were to finalise a resolution plan within six months. 
 
 “As regards the other (488) non-performing accounts, the IAC recommended that banks should finalise a resolution plan within six months. In cases where a viable resolution plan is not agreed upon within six months, banks should be required to file for insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 ( ),” the central bank had said on June 13. The RBI had also asked banks to move expeditiously on the 12 large   accounts.
 
 On June 22, the RBI had expanded the overseeing committee to five members from two and also brought the panel under its aegis. “The overseeing committee will, for the present, have five members, including a chairman, and will work through multiple benches as may be necessary and constituted by the chairman to opine on the cases referred to it by the banks,” the RBI had said in a release.
 
 “The reconstituted panel will work with an expanded mandate to review, in addition to cases being restructured under the Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets ( ), resolution of other cases where the aggregate exposure of the banking sector to the borrowing entity is greater than Rs 500 crore,” the central bank said. 
 
 Earlier, only cases referred under S4A were to be brought under the overseeing committee but after banks made representations to the central bank, its scope was expanded.
