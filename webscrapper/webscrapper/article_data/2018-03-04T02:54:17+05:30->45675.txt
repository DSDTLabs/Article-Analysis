NEW DELHI: Three men were   on Saturday for   a man and injuring his father when the duo tried to stop them from stealing a car accessory in Jaitpur on February 24.

 The accused hit 28-year-old Vishal and his father Mohan (50) with iron rods when they tried to stop them from stealing a car stereo. Vishal’s brother Rohit told police that the accused dragged Vishal along with their car and hit him against a pole. Later, during postmortem doctors found a bullet wound on his chest, which caused his death, police said.
 
 The arrested men told officers that they went to steal the stereo of a car parked outside Vishal’s house, but when the duo tried to stop them from doing so the accused decided to eliminate them. DCP (south-east)   said two of the accused, Shehnawaz and Mohammad Yaseer, were caught from Saurabh Vihar in southeast Delhi. They told police about their other associate Ankur Dubey alias Max, who apparently shot at Vishal. Dubey was arrested from northeast Delhi.
 
 Dubey said he met Shehnawaj in Jaitpur, where Dubey used to go to visit a friend. He met Yaseer at Okhla Mandi where he worked as a vegetable vendor. Yaseer was not able to meet his daily expenses with the money he earned and Dubey was needed money to pay for medical expenses of his ailing father. They then decided to steal car stereos and truck batteries and sell them to junk dealers to earn quick money.
 
 On February 4, they booked a cab — Wagon R — from Kashmere Gate to Noida. After reaching sector 39 in Noida, the men overpowered the cab driver and robbed the car.
 
 Police recovered the stolen car and the pistol used for shooting Vishal.
