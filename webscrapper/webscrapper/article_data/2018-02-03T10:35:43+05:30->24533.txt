CHANDIGARH:  's agriculture and panchayat minister  , who created a controversy during the 2014 state assembly poll campaign by promising to provide brides from   for bachelors in his state, on Friday again raised the issue of the state's unmarried men, mostly in rural areas. 

 After being trolled for his so-called promise, especially by former Bihar CM Lalu Yadav, Dhankar had withdrawn his campaign promise. Sex ratio in Haryana is the lowest in country forcing a large number men to remain unmarried. According to the 2011 census, there are only 879 women in Haryana for every 1,000 men.
 
 Dhankar, in an attempt to motivate male villagers, said their prospects of getting married would improve sharply if they managed to get high ratings for their villages. The village rating system of seven stars will be launched by his panchayat department from April 1.
 
 
 
 Last month, Dhankar had announced the ratings scheme for all Haryana villages, which would either get a threestar rating, a five-star rating or a seven-star rating.
 
 Addressing a district-level function of panchayat chiefs and members in Jhajjar on Friday, Dhankar said, “More than development of the villages, the star ratings will also help bachelors to get good matrimonial matches. Parents of marriageable girls will check the star ratings of the village. The girl will ask about the cleanliness, education level and other activities of the village before deciding whether to marry a prospective groom. Hence, all the bachelors too should start working for the star ratings of their villages.”
 
 Unmarried Haryanvi men mostly living in rural areas use marriage dealers who get them brides from other states.
