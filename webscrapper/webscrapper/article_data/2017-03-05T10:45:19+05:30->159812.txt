BHOPAL: Proposed   (MSW) and slaughterhouse at   will have an adverse impact on environment, claimed   on Saturday.

 The green activist visited the site after TOI on February 28 reported resentment among   to projects spread over 53 acre on government land. “MSW plant is proposed near an eco-sensitive zone. Besides prima facie, there seems to be less than expected space for a 500 metre buffer zone to encircle the MSW plant,” he said.
 
 Local activists also met Pandey, who was on a fact-finding mission to location, some 16 km from Bhopal. “A situation is developing where there is resentment against establishment of slaughterhouse in the same area. A MSW plant has also been proposed. The government should take stock of the environmental impact, too,” he said.
 
 After Pandey’s visit, Grameen Sangrash Morcha spokesperson Brijesh Jain said around 1,000 locals are planning a protest outside the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on March 9 to express their reservations about proposed slaughterhouse in their village.
 
 Given the situation, there is uncertainty over Rs 400 crore MSW plant to generate electricity from the waste. Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also announced city’s abattoir facility would be set up near the same location along Raisen Road.
 
 There are around 25 villages that could be adversely affected by proposed construction. Environmentalists warn of adverse effects on groundwater and soil in highly fertile area.
