CHENNAI: A day after a 33-year-old   admitted her two young children with suspected food poisoning to Apollo Hospital on   where she works, she attempted to kill herself on Tuesday with an overdose of pills.

 Doctors at the hospital, who would not state what medicines  , a resident of   in Ayanavaram, took in the attempted suicide, later referred her to Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital.
 
 “Gloria is unconscious but her condition is stable,” a police officer quoted a doctor treating her as saying. He said the circumstances did not allow the Ayanavaram police to obtain a statement from her on the suicide bid.
 
 Sources said but officials refused to confirm that Gloria, a staff nurse at Apollo Hospital for a couple of years, was part of a team that attended to former chief minister J Jayalalithaa from when she was admitted there last September till her death 75 days later on December 5.
 
 Gloria lives with her children  , 7, and Sujith, 6. Incidentally, her husband Vijayakumar, who owned a stationery shop, died of cardiac arrest four months ago.
 
 Praveen Kumar and Sujith collapsed at a tuition centre near their house on Sunday. They received treatment at Sundaram Medical Foundation in Anna Nagar before doctors referred them to Apollo Hospital. Doctors have sent blood and other samples from them to a forensic lab for analysis.
