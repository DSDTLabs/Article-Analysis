PÃ‰RIGUEUX: A cyclist was caught using a motorised bicycle during an amateur race in France on Sunday, the local public prosecutor revealed.

 The tampered bicycle was discovered following a race in southwest France, with the rider, who's name and age were not published, "admitting to using this system".
 
 "We were alerted by an employee of the French anti-doping agency of suspected cheating by the use of an electronic system, seemingly a little motor," the public prosecutor for   in the   commune   told AFP.
 
 It was found following a joint operation conducted by the anti-doping agency, the French cycling federation ( ) and the local public prosecutor's office.
 
 The rider was interviewed by police in a bid to find out how much he had gained in prize money from using the motorised bike, known as technological fraud in cycling.
 
 The FFC said it was the first such case in France.
 
 In January 2016, Femke   became the first competitive cyclist to be found using a motorised bike at the junior world cyclo-cross championships, an offence which saw the Belgian cop a six-year ban from the International Cycling Union.
