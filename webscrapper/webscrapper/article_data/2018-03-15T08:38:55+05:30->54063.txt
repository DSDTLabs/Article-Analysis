HYDERABAD: Telangana chief minister   on Wednesday spoke of a conspiracy hatched in Delhi to dethrone the TRS government and made it clear his role in national politics was to unite people and not float a new political front. In a marathon address to the Telangana assembly, he also said BJP president   sought TRS support for passage of the  .

 “A conspiracy was hatched in Delhi to dethrone our government. I had to use strategize to nip the plot in the bud. I will reveal more details at the appropriate time,” the CM said. On his foray into national politics, KCR said: “I have no intention of playing ‘chillar’ (cheap) politics of trying to bring together small parties. It is also not the Third Front as described by some. I will be uniting the masses of India. I have a big plan,” he said.
 
 Chandrasekhar Rao spoke about his national politics plan when he answered issues raised by opposition parties on his reply to motion of thanks on the governor’s address in the current budget session. The CM said some people were scoffing at his idea of getting into national politics. “People laughed when I started a movement for a separate Telangana state and I did achieve it,” he said.
 
 KCR’s clarification on national politics plan comes close on heels of a dinner hosted by Sonia Gandhi in Delhi which was attended by several regional parties. TRS had not been invited and neither did the party show interest.
 
 Earlier, the chief minister informed the house that BJP president Amit Shah had called him on Tuesday. “He sought cooperation of the TRS in ensuring smooth passage of the budget in parliament,” he said.
 
 While replying to issues raised by BJP floor leader G Kishan Reddy, and BJP MLA K Laxman,   at on more than one occasion said BJP legislators should try to get hitches cleared at the Centre on SC categorisation.
