BENGALURU: For Hindu nationalists and right wing activists, the green bus rolling down  , was as good as blasphemy. The bus was pasted with a portrait of Mohammed Ali  , the father of Pakistan, on its rear window, and was ironically named 'Democracy Travels'.

 No sooner was the picture of the bus clicked, than it went viral from the account of a self-proclaimed “Hindu nationalist“,  . The activist HR professional who worked with the NaMo brigade in 2014, posted the photograph on his Twitter feed. "Bus With   Jinnah's Photo In Bengaluru @CPBlr @narendramodi @HMOIndia @CMofKarnataka @KirenRijiju," read the tweet. Right-wing activists, including RSS functionaries, started circulating the picture on social media website and groups.
 
 As social media spilled over with the seething anger of right-wingers and nationalists, and allegations of the bus belonging to a Pakistani, and anyway , what could you expect from a Congress government in  , and so on, an anti-climax was brewing at the other end. A few media outlets and commoners replied to the angry posts, saying the bus was being used as a prop for a   movie being shot in the city. This helped calm the right voices. Meanwhile, it appeared that Kamath pursued the matter and spoke to the director of the Malayalam movie, and apparently asked him to remove Jinnah's picture.
 
 While the director stood his ground and claimed creative discretion, the owner of the bus, fearing a public backlash, reportedly removed the picture. “The Owner Has Apologised & Removed The Photo & Confirmed By Sending This,“ read a right winger's tweet.
