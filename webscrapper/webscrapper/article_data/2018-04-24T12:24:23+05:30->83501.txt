 * Ali Fazal: 
 by Daniel Quinn. The book is a conversation between a gorilla and a man. And it has to be read to be comprehended. It made me realise how unimportant the human species is. It talks about everything and yet nothing at all. Nothingness and fullness and their co- existence. 
 
 
  
 
 *  : The book that influenced me the most is 
  by Shrilal Shukla. The side of my personality that is satirical and humorous grew in leaps and bounds after reading this book. There are so many other books as well. That is the beauty of a book, every single one of them teaches you something or the other. 
 
  
  
 * Richa Chadha: I read 
 at a delicate time in my life. My father introduced me to it. I read a chapter on faith and something shifted in me. It was the first thick non-fiction book I completed after starting. I ended up gifting lots of copies to friends. I refer to it many times in a year. 
 
 
  
 * Arunoday Singh: The book that changed my perspective on life was introduced to me by my middle school World Religion and Ethics teacher,  . It was a collection of poems by   translated by  . I had always loved reading since I was a boy, and I had read widely and voraciously. But it wasn't until that book, that I ever became aware of their ability to heal and comfort all the formless aches in our soul. It was until that book that I believed words could weave magic spells too.
 
 
  
 * Sumeet Vyas: 
  by   changed the way I see the world and What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Haruki Murakami shaped the way I narrate a story.
