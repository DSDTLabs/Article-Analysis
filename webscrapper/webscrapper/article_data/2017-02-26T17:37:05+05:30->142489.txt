Jiyen Krishnakumar's multi-starrer film Tiyaan, which has been widely shot in locations across North India, also has quite a few non-Malayali actresses as part of its cast. 

 Actress  , who has starred in popular Hindi serials like Balika Vadhu, Sunaina and Kya Masti Kya Dhoom, plays Prithviraj's wife in the movie.
 An excited Mrudula says, 'Though I have done ads in the South, it's my first experience in a movie and it felt truly great. I play Prithviraj's wife's role in the film, and together we also have a little girl to take care of.'
 
 The actress confesses she can't reveal much about her character at this point, but says she has a Maharashtrian look in the movie. 'I am a Maharashtrian in real life and so, it was great that I got to play a role from my region in my debut movie. Most of my lines are in Hindi, but Prithviraj and the rest used to help me understand what exactly was going on, as they delivered their Malayalam lines, so it was a lot of learning and fun.' The actress has completed the shoot of her project.
