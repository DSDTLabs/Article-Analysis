Trichy: Makkal Adhikaram, a Tamil outfit has demanded the release of its 13 members, including women jailed for damaging the properties of Dakshina Bharata Hindi Prachar Sabha in Trichy.  Folk singer S Kovan and state treasurer of the outfit, Kaliappan submitted a petition to the Trichy district collector K Rajamani on Monday insisting on letting off all the arrested members of the outfit from Trichy Central Prison. The petition termed the case as a fabricated one to take revenge on them for their protest against the police in the death of R Usha, 30. Usha was the victim of the alleged police brutality in Trichy on March 7. “Our members registered their protest by defacing the name board of Hindi Prachar Sabha on April 7. Since our outfit had agitated for the police brutality against Usha, they avenged it by arresting our members now. It shows the oppression of the EPS government against the people protesting to retrieve the rights of Tamil Nadu in Cauvery issue,” said Kaliappan.  The Thillai Nagar police had registered cases against 11 men and two women of Makkal Adhikaram and lodged them in prison on Saturday. In fact, police arrested 65 protesters, including 17 women but remanded only 13 of them, while releasing the rest.  The outfit also condemned the arrest of their 26 protesters for trying to lay siege in front of the post office in Tiruvarur.  Makkal Adhikaram termed the oppression against the Cauvery protesters a triangle betrayal. “BJP-led Modi government is refusing to obey the Supreme Court order even after four decades of dragging. The Supreme Court is also helping the betrayal of the Modi government. EPS-led Tamil Nadu government mortgaged the self-respect and the state welfare. Tamil people jumped into protest against the triangle betrayal,” Kaliappan said.
