There are times when you are just trying to dig into your handbag, trying to find that perfect make-up product for yourself. The zillion   are bound to confuse you, so if you want to ease the process, here’s why you must invest in multi-purpose cosmetics. And what more? They are extremely travel-friendly, and multi-functional. 

 Make-up professional Meghna Butani says, “All-in-one cosmetics are budget-friendly too. Instead of buying a separate foundation and a compact, a multi-functional product serves the purpose which a single product has been doing up until now.”
 
 
 
 
 A lip and cheek stain is a double duty product that helps you get a natural looking just-blushed glow on your cheek along with strawberry lips. 
 
 
 Beautician Nishi Mulchandani says, “While being easy on your pocket, this super-saver cosmetic relieves you of the stress of carrying a separate eye liner and mascara in your vanity pouch everywhere.” You can also alternate this as an eye-liner. However, you must read up on the product to understand whether this cosmetic serves more than one purpose. 
 
 
  A foundation, compact and a concealer in just one neat compact. Use this product dry for a light matte finish or wet for high coverage and you are good to go.
