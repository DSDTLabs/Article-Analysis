Actor   has said that she 'sobbed hysterically' after watching her film   for the first time. "I watched the film for the first time with my best friend in October. We had a couple of glasses of white wine before we went in because I was so nervous, but we had our arms wrapped around each other," Ronan said 

  
  
 "Even though I knew what was going to happen in the film, I was laughing one moment and sobbing hysterically the next. It's about the beautiful struggle of being a teenager, growing and changing and getting to know yourself, and having the realisation that relationships change," she added. 
 
 The 23-year-old actor was in conversation with her director   for the newspaper. Ronan also said that she identified a lot with her character in the film. "I identify with a lot in 'Lady Bird'. The great thing about how you've written the character is that she doesn't know how great or special she is. And there's a huge sense of the importance of belonging, belonging to a place, a time in your life," Ronan told Gerwig. 
 
 'Lady Bird' has been nominated for five Oscars, including Best Actress for Ronan and, Best   and Best Original Screenplay for Gerwig. Gerwig is the fifth female director to be nominated in the history of the Academy Awards. The movie has already won two  .
