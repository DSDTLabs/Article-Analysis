NEW DELHI: Temperatures crossed the 40-degree Celsius mark in the capital for the first time this year on Friday as heat pumped up across the region and the Met office warned of heat wave conditions in Delhi-NCR for the next six days or so.

 Delhi’s main weather station, Safdarjung, recorded a maximum of 40.6 degrees C, five notches above normal, making it the first 40-degree-plus day in the city this season. Temperatures had been inching up to the mark for the past three days, ending a week or so of pleasant weather in the city.
 
 IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC) warned of a heat wave in Delhi from Saturday onwards, with peak temperatures likely to be in the 41-43 degrees C range.
 
 “High maximum temperature conditions are likely to last till April 19. The heat wave is likely to abate from April 20, with the advent of a fresh western disturbance over western Himalayan region from April 21, which is likely to bring rain and thunderstorm over the region,” an RWFC official said.
 
 Heat has been building up due to a wind flow pattern, called an anti-cyclone, over central Pakistan and west Rajasthan that’s likely to persist till April 19, Met officials said. An anti-cyclone reverses the normal wind flow and leads to downward motion of air, which increases heat over land. 
 
 Several stations in the capital registered higher temperatures than Safdarjung, with Palam recording 42.4 degrees C, Ayanagar 41.4 degrees and Delhi ridge 40.8 degrees.
 
 The met office said maximum temperatures on Saturday could hover around the 41-degree mark while minimum will be around 20 degrees C.
 
 According to India Meteorological Department’s parameters, a heat wave is declared in a city when the maximum temperature is at least 40 degrees C over two days and it’s five or more degrees higher than normal. Currently, heat wave conditions prevail at most places over west Rajasthan, Saurashtra and Kutch.
