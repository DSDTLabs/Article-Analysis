NEW DELHI: The Madurai bench of the   on Thursday dismissed two PILs against supply of Thamirabarani water to co-packers of Pepsi and Coca Cola.

 The court had in November last year granted an interim injunction, restraining multinational beverage companies   and Pepsi from taking water from Thamirabarani river.
 
 The Tirunelveli District Consumer Protection Association secretary DA Prabakar had filed a petition demanding a ban on supply of water from Thamirabarani river to the companies. 
 
 The petitioner had stated that there were about 20 integrated drinking water projects in Tuticorin, Tirunelveli, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar districts which depend on the Thamirabarani river.
 
 At a hearing in February this year, the petitioner's counsel had said agriculture is the main source of income to the Tirunelveli people and due to supply of water to the companies, the agricultural activity and livelihood of the people was getting affected. Besides, as per the Supreme Court order, water should not be taken for commercial purposes.
 
 However, Coca Cola and Pepsi said there were many companies that drew water from the river, but the petitioner had filed a case against the two companies only.
 
 The government submitted counter affidavits by the public works department and the Tirunelveli collector asserting there was sufficient water in the river and only the surplus of water is channeled to companies.
 
 Meanwhile, shopkeepers in   began removing Pepsi and Coke from their shelves on Wednesday after a call by the state's Traders Federation to boycott the soft drink giants.
 
 A ban was proposed on sale of these brands at the height of pro-jallikattu protests in the state in January, after it was claimed that the US-based NGO People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) was responsible for the Supreme Court ban on the bull-taming sport.
