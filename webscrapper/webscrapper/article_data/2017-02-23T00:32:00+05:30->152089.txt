JAIPUR: The Tiger Conservation Plan (TCP) of 16 reserves including   and   in the state are yet to be submitted by various states to   (NTCA).

 In reply to an RTI application, NTCA has stated that out of the total 50 tiger reserves in country, TCP of 34 tiger reserves has been approved while rest of the states including Assam, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu are yet to submit final TCPs.
 
 “So far, TCP for Ranthambore and Mukundhara Hills reserves is yet to be approved. We have submitted documents to NTCA and are hopeful to get the approval in coming months,” state chief wildlife warden, G V Reddy said.
 
 Like a working plan for territorial areas and management plan for national parks and sanctuaries, a TCP is needed under provisions (Section 38V) of NTCA for proper management of a tiger reserve, which includes staff development and deployment plan, said wildlife activist   who had filed the RTI application.
 
 Dubey said after constitution of NTCA in 2006, all states were asked to submit TCP of tiger reserves coming under their ambit.
 
 However, even after the   directives to comply with the guidelines, states have failed to submit TCPs.
 
 In its objectives, NTCA had defined that TCP aims at ecologically compatible land uses in tiger reserves and areas linking it to another for addressing the livelihood concerns of locals, so as to provide dispersal habitats and corridors for spillover population of wild animals from designated core areas.
