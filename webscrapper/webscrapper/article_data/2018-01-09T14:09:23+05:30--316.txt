 A special team was formed by Naubatpur police to investigate the two cases. “During the interrogation, it was revealed that Anjay’s brother   had a rivalry with one Shailesh over land dispute during the election for ward councillor last year. To eliminate Vijay, Shailesh hired contract killer Gulab for Rs50,000. When the contract killers failed to track down Vijay, they planned to kill his brother Anjay,” the SSP said.
 
 “Paras was killed by Gulab as he had refused to pay extortion money. Paras was indulged in illegal timber business. All the accused will be produced in court and sent to jail,” he said.
