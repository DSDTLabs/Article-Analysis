Mandya: In a disturbing incident at Madarahalli, Bharathinagar in the district, a few miscreants have injured a painted spark  , which veterinarians now say can never fly again.

 The incident, which was reported on Saturday, appears to be one in a spate of recent attacks on birds in the past few months.
 
 Doctors at the Kokkarebellur Bird Sanctuary, who treated the injured pelican, said that the bird would not be able to fly again.
 
 Dr Satish, a veterinarian from Kolagere, said that the injury to the pelican’s right wing was very severe. “The pelican was found unconscious in the backwaters of Sulekere in Bharathinagar. It will no longer be able to fly,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, the villagers want police and forest department to launch an investigation into the incident. President of the Madarahalli Hejjarle Association Lingegowda said that miscreants had maimed the pelican with stones. “We want a team dedicated to curb this practice of pelican hunting,” he added.
 
 The villagers alleged that several bird hunters were on the prowl in the surrounding villages, making pelicans vulnerable.
