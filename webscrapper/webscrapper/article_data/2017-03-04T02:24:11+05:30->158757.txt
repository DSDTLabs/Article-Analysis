NEW DELHI: Hoping for big gains in the sixth phase of voting in UP, the   has unleashed its full strength in the region where 49 seats vote on Saturday. The party sees a possibility of maximising gains here, in comparison to the stiff contest it expects in the 40 seats voting in the last phase on March 8.

 Targeting 25 to 30 of the 49 seats in this backward region, BJP is wooing non-Jatav Dalit and non-Yadav OBC votes across Maharjaganj, Kushi Nagar, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Azamgarh, Mau and Ballia – beyond its traditional Brahmin and Thakur votes.
 
 Dalits constitute Mayawati’s support base and Jatavs among Dalits considered her core voters. The BJP strategy is to wean away a chunk of the Dalit vote that’s traditionally BSP’s. It’s also to be seen if the non-Yadav OBCs — Kurmi and Santhwar— shift loyalty from   to BJP.
 
 Since this region has the maximum concentration of upper caste voters that’s typically voted BJP, the party hopes that it will as always rally in its favour. But in this backward rural area, where agriculture suffers, social indices are poor, and caste rivalries common, whether Brahmins and Thakurs come together for BJP is the big question. With Yogi Adityanath leading the BJP charge in this belt, Brahmins will need to back him for his campaign to bear fruit. This region will also test the   government’s pro-poor policies, including demonetisation.
 
 The region is best suited for BJP’s Hindutva brand of politics. Polarisation of voters works best in these regions dominated by the upper castes and a substantive Muslim population.
