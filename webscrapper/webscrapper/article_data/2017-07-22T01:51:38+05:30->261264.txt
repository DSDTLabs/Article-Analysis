NEW DELHI:   Delhi Municipal   has decided to replace its conventional   with LED ones. 

 The project was first taken up by South Delhi Municipal Corporation. The North corporation has implemented it in two of its wards.
 
 Under the project, semi-high mast lights, high mast lights in parks and all streetlights will be changed. North corporation commissioner PK Gupta said there are 2.05 lakh streetlights under their jurisdiction. “In the first phase, about 1.25 lakh streetlights will be converted and the remaining will be done in the second phase. The contract has been awarded for the Rohini and Narela zones and we have finalised the tender for the remaining four zones,” said Gupta. He emphasised that the project will be completed in a time-bound manner and about 20,000 lights will be converted every week.
 
 “We have signed an agreement with TPDDL and Havells. Havells will provide LED lights and TPDDL will have the charge for maintenance. The manufacturer specially designed the product to meet our specifications that includes minimum 7 years life span of light. The manufacturer took almost 2.5 months to develop the product,” said Gupta.
 
 Gupta further said that this will help the north corporation to save 64% of energy. “Every year we spent about Rs 125 crore on streetlights. The project will help us to save about Rs 50 crore annually. North Corporation will also get a share of 21% of revenue annually,” said Gupta. 
 
 He added that to ensure that the streetlights function perfectly, Central Control Monitoring systems would be installed zone-wise.
 
 South Corporation had replaced about 1.9 lakh streetlights in a period of one year. Gupta said north civic body will finish the project within six months.
