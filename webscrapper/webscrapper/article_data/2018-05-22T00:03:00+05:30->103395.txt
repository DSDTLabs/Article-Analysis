Pune: The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd, in a statement released on Monday, has stated that the fire which broke out at a sandwich stall near the Zensar IT Park in Kharadi on May 11, was not due to a transformer blast or oil seeping out of it. 

 The power utility has cited an investigation report submitted by the electrical inspector of Public Works Department in this regard. The inspector is an independent authority who investigates accidents that are suspected to have been caused by electric installations, it said.
 
 The statement states that the stall located near the transformer caught fire first and the 200 KVA transformer mounted on a cement platform with an iron mesh compound was intact. 
 
 The transformer caught fire after the branches of a mango tree behind the stall caught fire and fell on the transformer and its supply lines. The company disconnected power supply to prevent any untoward incident. MSEDCL suffered a loss of Rs 2 lakh in the fire and a criminal case was filed against the sandwich stall owner with the Chandannagar police.
