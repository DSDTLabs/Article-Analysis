NAGPUR: Continuing her fine form,   stormed into the final of the   World Tour Super 500 Badminton tournament in Jakarta on Saturday. In a thrilling women's singles semifinal, Saina stunned fourth seed   21-19, 21-19. 

 However, it was curtains for the men's doubles pair of   and Chirag Shetty. Marcus Fernaldi Gideon and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo of Indonesia, the top seeds and number one pair in the world, halted their run with a 21-14, 21-11 win in 30 minutes.
 
 It was the third successive win for the Indonesians against the young Indian duo, ranked 32nd in the world. Satwik-Chirag had knocked out the fourth and eighth seeds en route to the last four.
 
 Going into the match, history and form were with world No. 12 Saina. With a 8-5 head-to-head record against the Thai world No. 4, Saina dished out champion stuff to overcome the stiff challenge.
 
 Although, Saina registered a straight-game win in 49 minutes, the match was intensely fought. Intanon took a slender 3-1 lead initially which was pulled back by Saina to level the score at 5-5. However, the 22-year-old former world champion took the upper hand to go up 13-11. But Saina kept her cool in the closing stages to narrowly clinch the first game.
 
 Saina dominated the second game from the beginning to take a handy six-point (17-11) lead. But Intanon clawed her way back to level things at 18-18. Just like the previous game, the 27-year-old Indian kept her composure in pressure situations to register a sensational victory.
 
 Saina will now clash with world No. 1 Tai  . The in-form   player leads the head-to-head record 8-5, with the Hyderabadi having lost the last six matches against her. The last time Saina had beaten her nemesis was in the 2013 Swiss Open quarterfinal.
 
 "It was one more tough round against Ratchanok Intanon. It was nice to be on the winning side in semifinals here in Jakarta. Against Sindhu too yesterday, it was a really tough match," said Saina.
