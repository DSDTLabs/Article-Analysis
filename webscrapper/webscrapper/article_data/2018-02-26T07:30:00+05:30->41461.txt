Chandigarh: The Central Administrative Tribunal ( ) issued a contempt notice to B S Chavan, director-principal, Government Medical College and Hospital ( ), Sector 32, for disobeying its orders of not promoting an officiating nursing superintendent.

 Kiran Bala had demanded Chavan should be directed to consider her for promotion to the post of nursing superintendent from the date she became eligible.
 
 Bala was initially appointed as staff nurse on July 12, 1996. She was kept on two-year probation, which she completed on April 24, 1999. Bala was appointed as nursing sister on April 25, 1997. She was promoted to assistant nursing superintendent on March 3, 2005. Her petition said, “Nursing superintendent is made amongst matrons (assistant nursing superintendent) or sister tutors by direct appointment. The post of nursing superintendent was lying vacant since August 31, 2008, and since the UT administration is having no specific rules applicable to the petitioner, the rules of Punjab would be followed,” the petitioner said.
 
 The petitioner said since she was fully eligible for the post of nursing superintendent, she was given additional charge of the post on April 10, 2012, with the assurance that she would be promoted shortly.
 
 She submitted her representation to the authorities on June 26, 2013, to promote her but to no avail. On March 2, 2016, instead of promoting her on regular basis, she was given officiating charge. She pointed out that she would retire on February 2018. She moved the tribunal and ordered on January 11 and directed the authorities to complete requisite proceedings for conveying the departmental promotion committee for promotion of petitioner to the post of nursing superintendent within a month.
 
 But even after the tribunal orders, the respondent did not comply with the order and the petitioner again moved contempt petition.
