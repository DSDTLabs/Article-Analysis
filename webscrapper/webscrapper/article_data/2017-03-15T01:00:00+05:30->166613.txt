 is back to entertain his fans in his next, ' ', which releases on March 17. The actor, who has produced the film under his banner Mangal Tara TV & Films, says, “It feels like I am starting over once again. I’ve worked on this film for more than two years, so it’s very special. It was tougher this time around as coming back as a hero after a long gap is difficult. I’ve never worked so hard in my life, as I have for this film. Being just the hero is far easier than being a hero and a producer.” The actor promises that this full-fledged comeback venture is sure to please his diehard fans. “This is an out-an-out masala entertainer with a message. 

 It shows how we all may start as zero, but the right choices can turn us into heroes. The film will appeal to the masses who have always loved me as well as those who expect me to do something new. Nobody thought I could act and do a film like Hatya back then, but I took my chances and that’s what I am doing now,” he explains. When asked what took him so long to return as a solo hero, Govinda candidly admits, “I wasn’t getting the roles I wanted and I wasn’t keen on playing the roles that were offered to me. So, I chose to make this film as I wanted to do something for myself. Also, the positive reaction to my work in ' ' and 'Happy Ending' made me realise that people still love me.”
 
 Reminiscing about his career, he sums up, “It has been 20 years since ' ' released and I have seen a lot of ups and downs since then. Today, I feel content with the way 'Aa Gaya Hero' has shaped up.”
