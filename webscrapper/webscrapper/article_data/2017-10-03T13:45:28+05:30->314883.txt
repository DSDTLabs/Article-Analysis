NAGPUR: We should adapt to ‘economy of permanence’ and try to bring about a long lasting change for the betterment of our country. It was Mahatma Gandhi’s dream that our farmers be liberated. It is sad that we focused more on cities and left our villages to fend for themselves, said  , retired officer of Gramin Gram Udyog Commission at Kasturba Bhavan, Bajaj Nagar, on Monday.

 He was giving a lecture on ‘Mahatma Gandhijinchya Swapnatil Bharat’ during a 7- day Mahatma Gandhi Festival held by  .
 
 His lecture began with a video clip on Khadi Gram Udyog Commission and Jawanjal spoke about poverty prevailing in India. Referring to a term from 'Economy of Permanence’ written by noted economist JC Kumarappa, Jawanjal said, “Economy of parasite — dependency on the others — is also one of the reasons why we are still a developing nation.” 
 
 Terming quality education as key to nation’s development, Jawanjal said “Education should not only make us wise but also build leadership qualities in us.” 
 
 Focusing on the saying ‘man needs to change in order to bring about a change’, Jawanjal said, “Youths should be allowed to explore and must be supported in order to become self-reliant.”
 
 Along with Jawanjal, Ravindra Deoghare (Shalab) from   and other dignitaries were present at the event. Akash Waghmare compèred the show and proposed vote of thanks too.
