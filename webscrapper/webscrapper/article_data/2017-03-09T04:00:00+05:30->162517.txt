Vadodara: Mimansha Walia, a student of MET International School, emerged winner of Classmate Spell Bee Season 9’s online semi finals conducted for Vadodara. Walia will now be in the contention to compete the national finals of the competition.

 In the initial phase, an on-ground exercise was conducted across 25 schools in Vadodara where children were given spelling tests. Top 15 scorers from each school then competed in the city finals round. The top performers from the finals then competed in the semi final stage of the competition. The competition this year is powered by The Times of India and Times NIE is the education partner.
 
 A city winner does not automatically qualify for the national finals. Only 16 students with the top 16 scores across India will qualify purely on the score merit.
 
 The culmination of Classmate Spell Bee Season 9 will see a gruelling competition between the top 16 scorers of India to win the title of Classmate Spell Bee Season 9’s national champion. Rajkot is one of the 30 cities in which such semi finals were conducted.
 
 The national champion will win a prize of Rs two lakh besides an opportunity to witness the prestigious Scripps National Spelling Bee with a parent in Washington DC U.S.A. in an all expenses paid trip. 
 
 The four semi finalists will win a cash prize of Rs. 50,000 each.
