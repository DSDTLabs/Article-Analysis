PIMPRI CHINCHWAD:   and   are in the lead in Pimpri Chinchwad to be named the model area for development under the Smart Cities Mission.

 Earlier this month, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation had initiated a process wherein the citizens would cast votes to pick the model area for the project. The civic body has also been gathering views on different aspects and features of the project.
 
 The administration will declare the results in a week’s time. While the population of Pimpri Chinchwad is around 20 lakh, a sample of 2 lakh citizens is being considered for this survey.
 
 Many IT professionals reside in housing societies in Pimple Saudagar and Wakad, which have received over 50,000 votes. Sangvi and Nigdi-Pradhikaran are second in the race with 35,000 votes. 
 
 Traffic congestion was on top of the people’s minds, with most calling for improved traffic management across the city. This problem took precedence over even pollution monitoring, and the ease of access to municipal services.
 
 Among the other model areas are Moshi, Spine Road, Pimpri-Chinchwad station area, Bhosari and Chikhli. The development projects implemented in the model area, would then be replicated across the twin township. 
 
 Pune is also a part of the Smart Cities Mission, and chose Aundh-Baner-Balewadi as its model area two years back. Over a period of five years, both the state and Centre will grant PCMC funding to the tune of Rs1,000 crore. Among the projects planned are expansion of BRTS corridors, Wi-Fi hotspots, 24X7 water supply, and e-learning in municipal schools. 
 
 A special purpose vehicle will be formed for implementation of the projects
 
 Last week, suggestions had been sought from key government departments in this regard. They included the  , transport utility PMPML, and the Pimpri Chinchwad New Township Development Authority. 
 
 Municipal commissioner  , who chaired the meeting, said the suggestions will included in the smart city proposal.
