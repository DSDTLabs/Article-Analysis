Aurangabad: The   bench of Bombay high court has disposed the suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) that it had initiated for release of two female elephants housed at a city-based zoo.

 B   — curator of   in   — was personally present before the court during the latest hearing to submit that both the elephants were safely transported from Aurangabad.
 
 He also informed the court that both elephants are in good condition at the Visakhapatanam park. In the light of submissions made by different parties, the court observed that the purpose of filing the PIL was served and therefore disposed it off.
 
 The PIL was initiated by the court by taking note of TOI’s report that highlighted how mother elephant and her adult calf were housed in the zoo in violation of the set rules.
 
 While the news report was published on August 25 last year, the court had initiated the PIL four days i.e. on August 29, 2017. After couple of hearings in the case, the elephants were shifted on December 10 last year.
 
 Central  , Chief Wild Life Wardens of governments of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, Aurangabad Municipal Corporation, and Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Visakapatanam) were made party in the case by then two-member bench of judges Shantanu Kemkar and Nitin Sambre.
