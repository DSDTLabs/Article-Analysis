MUMBAI: Admissions under the Right to Education Act quota are expected to recommence at city schools this week after being stalled for more than a month. The admissions had been put on hold with the state government incorporating changes to include students from backward classes and those living with HIV. The parents are expected to get nearly a week to make fresh applications. The second lottery for admissions is scheduled to be held between June 1 and 3. 

 BMC officials said they have received instructions from the state education department to proceed with the second round of admissions. "We will tally vacancies available after the first round of and then give parents time to make fresh applications. Those who had not filled up forms in the first round too can apply," said  , education officer, BMC. 
 
 Recently, the school education department included children belonging to socially backward categories like de-notified tribes, nomadic tribes, special backward classes and those living with HIV irrespective of the income of their parents were included under the 25% quota admissions. The Bombay high court had stayed the admission process for seven days to allow inclusion of the changes.
 
 Activist groups helping parents with admissions are unhappy with the delay as admissions will go on after the academic year has begun. "In non-state board schools, the year has begun and students are missing out. The state was to finish four rounds of admission by April 30. Also, there is no clarity on what parents need to do, leaving many confused," said   of NGO Anudanit Shiksha Bachao Samiti.
