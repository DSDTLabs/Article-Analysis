BHOPAL: After a notice was served by district administration to city’s   to file their audited accounts of the last three years till April 7, only 48 schools have submitted the report so far. The   private school fee regulation act, which came into force on February 7, mandates that private schools must submit their audited accounts of the last three years and include a proposal of the increment to state government within 90 days of session commencement.

 “We received report of fee from 48   schools so far while other schools have asked for few more days to complete their report. We will analyse the record after which fee regulation committee would decide the quantum of fee hike for current academic session,” said additional collector Disha Nagvanshi. She said all private schools affiliated to MP board and CBSE will have to submit their record. Nagvanshi added that the district committee which will look into regulation of school fee and related issues, would then inspect the accounts of those private schools whose annual receipts compared to expenditure is less than 10%. “As soon as we go through their reports, we will be able to know which school will be allowed a 10% fee hike for the new academic year,” she said.
 
 The fee regulation act requires private schools to submit the proposed fee structure for the ensuing academic year and necessitates district committee to examine the documents and accounts presented before it. It also states that the school education department must appoint a chartered accountant to examine the records and submit the report to the state government.
 
 Meanwhile, a delegation of parents reached district collector’s office on Tuesday to register a complaint against one of the city schools which has allegedly asked around 35 students to sign discharge forms after they failed to submit school fee.
 
 District collector Sudam Khade has directed officials to look into the matter as soon as possible.
