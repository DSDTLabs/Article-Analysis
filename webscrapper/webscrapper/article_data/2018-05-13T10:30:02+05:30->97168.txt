AMBALA: A   co-manager has been accused of withdrawing Rs 2.5 crore from accounts of dozens of customers after faking their signatures in a   that has forced the authorities to suspend him.

 Superintendent of police (SP) Abhishek Jorwal has ordered registration of a case against Sachin Gondi posted at the Naraingarh branch of HDFC Bank after some of the victims met him on Saturday.
 
  
 
 Ram Avtar, one of the complainants, alleged Gondi had demanded his cheque book to keep his children’s accounts active. Later, Avtar found out that Gondi had faked his signatures and withdrawn Rs 19 lakh from the accounts. He said Gondi had cheated others too in a similar manner. 
 
 The customers first approached the police after Gondi’s parents on May 2 alleged he had gone missing. However a day later, they claimed Sachin has returned. When the customers tried to visit him, his parents refused them entry.
 
 The victims alleged Gondi had threatened to commit suicide and implicate them. “Whenever we try to talk about our money with him, he threatens to write our names in his suicide note,” said Ram Avtar.
 
 Naraingarh police station in-charge sub-inspector Suresh Kumar said a complaint had been registered and customers were guided to approach the SP office.
 
 Rajeev Banerjee, vice-president, HDFC Bank, Mumbai, “We have suspended the employee till investigation is under way. We will fully cooperate with the authorities from our end. If the employee has carried out the fraud, he will not be spared.”
