Fatehgarh Sahib: A sewadar of Gurdwara Bibangarh Sahib in Fatehgarh Sahib district beheaded the shrine incharge, Baba Pyara Singh, on Thursday. Cops said the accused was under the influence of some intoxicant when he committed the crime. However, sources claimed there was an old rivalry between the two groups of nihangs to which the accused and the victim belonged.

 The incident took place late in the evening, when Baba Pyara Singh (45) was coming out of the main hall of the gurdwara and was attacked by Charanjit Singh (40). 
 
 The sewadar stabbed him multiple times with a knife, before taking out his sword and severing his head with a single blow.
