HYDERABAD: Cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday said Punjab chief minister   should answer on the government's move to ask Supreme Court to uphold the conviction against him in a road-rage case 30 years ago. 

 "Why are you asking me that question about why the government took the stand? Ask the chief minister. As for now, I have respect for the judiciary," Sidhu told TOI in an interview in Hyderabad. The Punjab minister was in Hyderabad to study the mining policy of Telangana for replication in his state. Sidhu is chairman of a Punjab government committee mandated to make recommendations on mining policy. 
 
 Asked if he dreaded the prospect of being sent to jail, Sidhu said: "I'm not someone to get scared. I have a strong will and I am a balanced person." 
 
 Sidhu was embroiled in a road rage case in Patiala in which one person died. The lower court had acquitted him, but the HC reversed the order and gave him three years imprisonment. Sidhu got bail in the case and appealed in SC. Last week, the Punjab government informed the SC it should uphold the conviction for Sidhu.
 
 Sidhu is a minister in the Amrinder Singh-led   government in Punjab and the fact that the government pressed for his conviction has raised eyebrows. Sidhu himself is obviously unhappy, but does not want to speak out.
 
 At a news conference, when Sidhu, who is known to be articulate, was asked why he shying away from making a public statement, he said: "Can I be forced to speak on what I do not want to? I will submit myself to the majesty of the law," he said and questioned if it was mandatory for him to speak on the issue when all he wanted to say was 'no reaction'.
 
 Speaking on mining policy, Sidhu said Punjab was considering Telangana as an example and wants to come up with a sand mining policy to ensure more money goes into government coffers.
