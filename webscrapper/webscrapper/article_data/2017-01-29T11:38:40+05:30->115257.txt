The feud between   and   goes back a long way when Yash Raj Films' ' ' starring Sushant in the lead, was shelved by the production house. Reportedly, Sushant lost out on a number of major films which were offered to him because of 'Paani.' There were also reports about Sushant being offered ' ' which ultimately went to  , ruining the relationship between the two. However, Sushant has not only made it clear that he was never considered for 'Befikre' but also said that even if he were, he wouldn't have taken it up.

  
  
 Sushant issued a statement to the media, that said, 'Let me clear it once and for all, I was never offered 'Befikre.' But had I been offered, I wouldn't have done it. I know it's easier to decide after the results are out but I have a reason. If the same production is offering me niche films like 'Byomkesh Bakshy,' I would do it. And I would also do a 'Paani' where Shekhar Kapur will be a raising a very important, immediate issue.'
 
 Further speaking about 'Befikre,' Sushant said, 'If 'Befikre' was representing the new-age youth of India and romance as what it was claiming, it would have been great irrespective of the box-office numbers. But unfortunately, it didn't do that and hence I would not be interested. I am not suggesting that films should only reflect reality (like 'Pink,' 'Neerja' or Dhoni biopic.) They could also be fanciful films like 'The Jungle Book', which was also very popular. But it's extremely important to know and then claim what you have made.'
 
 Wonder what Aditya Chopra and Ranveer Singh have to say to that?
