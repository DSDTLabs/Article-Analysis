 JAIPUR: Delay in   for quantity of spirit to be produced per quintal grain led excise department in a   of Rs 180.80 crore. Several other irregularities emerged in performance audit on ‘functioning of distilleries, breweries and   engaged in production of beer and liquor under excise act’. Report was placed before the assembly on Tuesday. 
 
 “There was a delay of 10 years in fixing norms for production of spirit from grain. The   of spirit during 2010-15 in case of six distilleries, when compared to norms fixed in 2015, was 93.35 lakh bull litre (BL) spirit. The revenue forgone was Rs 180.80 cr in form of excise duty,” noted the CAG. 
 
 It was also observed in audit that distilleries and bottling plants produced spirit,   (IMFL) and country liquor (CL) more than the quantity prescribed in the consent to operate. No permission to regularize excess daily production was taken by the units from Rajasthan state pollution control board or the department. The department too failed to monitor production of alcohol over and above daily/annual prescribed capacity.
