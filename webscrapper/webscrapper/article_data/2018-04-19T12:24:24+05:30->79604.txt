LUDHIANA: The residents of E Block of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar are still waiting for the construction of roads near 40 square yards of land, which was vacated of illegal shanties by the   (LIT) officials last year. Residents rued that before MC polls,   leaders made promises to get the   constructed as soon as possible, and they also inaugurated the work, but even two months after MC elections, the road work did not start.

 Residents rued illegal shanties on this land had become a blot for the area, and after several requests and complaints to the officials concerned, these encroachments were removed. However, the officials had also thrown material for road construction on the site, but work could not start till date. Residents claimed there were 122 plots adjoining this land, and people who owned these plots would be constructing their houses. This road would link the area directly to a 100-feet road, which will further get connected with other areas of the city, so commuters need not get stuck in the traffic jams on Pakhowal Road. 
 
 Residents also claimed they highlighted the matter with officials several times, but did not get any satisfactory reply from them. Rather, the officials were taking the contractorâ€™s side by saying he was busy with some other construction work, and when he got free, the work would be done. Residents blamed the officials for not taking any action against the contractor, but instead pushing back the deadlines for completion of the work. 
 
 However, LIT executive engineer   said there was leakage in the water supply lines, due to which the contractor could not start the work, but now the sewerage board had fixed the problem, and very shortly, the road construction work would also begin.
