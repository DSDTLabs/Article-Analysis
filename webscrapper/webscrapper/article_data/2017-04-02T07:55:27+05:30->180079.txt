 To quench the thirst of backyard birds and keep them cool during summer, the college has placed water pots at several places across the campus. The initiative started by the students of department of social works of the college is attracting birds in the campus. 
 
 Head of the department of social work Loveena Lobo told STOI that students of the community development, human resource development and medical and psychiatry forums are maintaining these water pots on the campus. “It is a part of our concern towards birds and environment. As an extra activity, the students fill all the pots regularly and ensure that birds in the campus do not suffer from heatstroke or dehydration. In fact, the students had started this initiative during last summer and the college is committed to continue it in future too,” Loveena said.
 
 The post graduate department of social work has 110 students in its first and second year batches. In addition to three forums, the Centre for Social Concern of the department has also been joining ands for all such activities.
