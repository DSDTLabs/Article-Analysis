AHMEDABAD: In an innovative solution to prevent oneself from the ill-effects of air pollution, Ahmedabad Textile Industry’s Research Association (ATIRA) has developed a specialized mask made of nano-fibre that helps one breathe fresh air, while filtering pollutants in the air. While the technology was developed by  , the mask was designed by students and experts at   (NID), Ahmedabad.

 “The nano web-based technology used to make the mask will help filter bacteria and virus. Since traffic police personnel are constantly exposed to harsh outdoor environments, this mask will help them breathe fresh air,” said C R Prayag, deputy director, ATIRA.
 
 The mask has a high filtration efficiency. “The nano-fibre technology helps filter germs including bacteria and viruses in addition to particulate matter (PM) of 2.5 microns,” he added. PM 2.5 particles in the air raise serious concerns over the city’s air quality.
 
 In the first phase, some 5,000 masks have been distributed to the traffic police department for use. Appreciating the initiative, A K Singh, commissioner of police, Ahmedabad, said, “Traffic police personnel are usually at the mercy of harsh environmental conditions on which they have no control. We will conduct dense trials of this product across as many junctions as possible and note the feedback and pass it on. Such technology can benefit us to a great extent.”
 
 Director of NID, Ahmedabad, Pradyumna Vyas, said the institute will seek feedback from the traffic cops and make necessary amends in the design.
 
 Going forward, ATIRA will be providing necessary support for undertaking commercial production of the mask. “Industries that are interested in marketing this product will need to approach ATIRA. We will handhold them and help with the technology implementation and take it to a commercial level,” said Prayag.
