New Delhi: Delhi chief minister   on Saturday sought to take credit for the Punjab government's move to ban beacons on government vehicles and said the decision was taken due to AAP's new form of politics.

 “AAP has definitely changed politics. Captain Amarinder has denied red beacons and wants Lokpal now. We started this, we are glad that they are doing this. Had they brought Lokpal before, we would not have been in politics now,” Kejriwal said in an interaction with volunteers where he gave a pep talk to boost their morale after the party's poor showing in Punjab.
 
 The party won 20 seats in the state, much below its expectations, and drew a blank in Goa. The new Congress government in Punjab under Chief Minister   today announced a series of decisions including a ban on use of beacons on government vehicles, foreign travel of ministers for two years and organising of banquets on state expense, in a bid to end VIP culture in Punjab.
 
 In his message to volunteers, Kejriwal also said they should assist Punjab leaders in playing the role of an effective Opposition and ensure that the Congress fulfils its promises made during polls.
