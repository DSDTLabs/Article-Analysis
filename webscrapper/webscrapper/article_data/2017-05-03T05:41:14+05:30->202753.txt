MUMBAI: The   will desilt  ,459 dams across the state. A proposal to remove the silt and distribute it free to farmers, who can use it as manure, was approved by the state cabinet on Tuesday. 

 The project, at a cost of Rs 6,236 crore, will be done in phases over four years. It is estimated that there are 5.18 lakh cubic metres of silt in the dams. The government will issue contracts to remove the silt. The dams have a water storage capacity of 43 lakh cubic metres and irrigate 8.68 lakh hectares.
 
 The silt will be provided free to local farmers but they will have to transport it to their farms. The government will pay for machinery and fuel to remove the silt; it will also permit funds from Corporate Social Responsibility to be used.
 
 The dams identified cater to less than 2,500 hectares and are over five years old. "This will increase the water-holding capacity of dams and will provide rich silt to farms," the government said.
 
 Farmers will have to apply to the local sarpanch for permission to take the silt. Committees will be set up at the state, district and taluka levels to implement the scheme. 
 
 BMC had mooted a proposal to desilt Tansa lake at a cost of Rs 200 crore in 2011 but the plan was dropped when it received good rainfall.
 
 "The quality of silt from dams is very good and will nourish our farms," said Vishwas Gangadhare, a farmer and activist from Nashik.
