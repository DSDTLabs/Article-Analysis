NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will observe a day-long fast on Thursday along with all party MPs in protest against the washout of the recent Parliament session. Party sources said Modi will stick to his schedule and work from his residence at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg despite the fast.

 He will proceed to Tamil Nadu later in the day to inaugurate the defence expo in Kanchipuram near Chennai. BJP chief Amit Shah will join the protest in Hubli, Karnataka. Union minister JP Nadda will be in the PM’s constituency Varanasi for the fast as Modi will be busy with official engagements. 
 
 
 
 
 
 “To expose the Congress for its undemocratic style of functioning, and pursuing divisive politics and anti-development agenda, PM Modi will observe day-long fast on April 12... He will be joined by BJP MPs who will also observe a day-long fast and hold ‘dharnas’ across India,” a party statement said. “All MPs must observe one-day fast before the collector at their respective district headquarters and should clearly place facts before the public and media that the Congress has murdered democracy by stalling Parliament,” a party advisory sent to all MPs said. 
 
 On Wednesday, Modi will chair a Cabinet meeting to review the status of schemes dedicated to Bhimrao Ambedkar. The ruling dispensation has planned country-wide celebrations on the Dalit icon’s birth anniversary on April 14. 
 
 “The cabinet meeting is themed around Ambedkar as the PM will take stock of work done in projects for welfare of the poor and underprivileged,” a source said. Modi will address BJP lawmakers through hotline on Wednesday as most MPs will be stationed in their constituencies observing ‘Social Harmony Day’ on the occasion of another Dalit icon Jyotiba Phule’s birth anniversary. 
 
 On April 14, Modi will unveil several monuments dedicated to Ambedkar, including the place where he breathed his last in the capital.
