ERODE: The   government is far better than DMK in taking care of government employees, said state school   minister K A Sengottaiyan.

 Addressing at an event to celebrate late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s birth anniversary at   here on Sunday, he said the recent strike by transport unions was instigated for political reasons. “There are few people who want to keep the trade unions alive by instigating protests,’’ he alleged. Still AIADMK government fulfilled all the demands placed by the striking trade union workers of the transport department, he said. The welfare of workers was being taken care in spite of the fact that transport corporations were being operated at loss, he said.
 
 On the other hand, the DMK had least regard for welfare of transport corporation workers. “It was DMK that allowed a number of private buses,” he said.
