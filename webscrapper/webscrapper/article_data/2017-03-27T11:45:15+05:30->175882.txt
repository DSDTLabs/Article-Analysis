State BJP president Jitu Vaghani on Sunday held a meeting with BJP MLAs, civic body chiefs and district representatives of Saurashtra in Rajkot and deliberated on how the party can gain seats in the all-important region. It is noteworthy that Vaghani belongs to Bhavnagar and CM Rupani hails from Rajkot. Improving the party’s tally in the forthcoming elections will be an acid test for the two top leaders of the BJP in Gujarat. Saurashtra and Kutch account for 53 Assembly seats out which BJP has its MLAs on 35 seats. BJP has set a target of winning 40-plus seats in the region, said a party source who attended the Sunday meet.

 The source said besides   and Amit Shah, UP CM   will be the star campaigners for the party, which has set a target of winning 150 seats in the forthcoming elections. Jitu Vaghani’s meeting with top party functionaries of the region holds significance in light of the fact that BJP national President Amit Shah will be in Ahmedabad on a two-day trip beginning March 29. Shah’s likely to take stock of the preparations in various regions of the state.
 
 Interacting with media persons post the meeting, Jitu Vaghani said: “After gathering more than 300 seats in Uttar Pradesh elections, BJP has set a target of 150 seats in Gujarat. An initial list of BJP campaigners has been drawn and the newly elected CM of UP Yogi Adityanath will be one of the star campaigners.”
 
 On likelihood of early elections, he commented elections will be held at proper time and BJP is not planning for an early election. Reacting to state Congress chief Bharatsinh Solanki’s claim that 8 BJP MLAs were in touch with the party to switch over, Vaghani said: BJP’s core strength is its unity and I challenge Solanki to announce the names of these MLAs. Fact is, Congress is known for misleading people.”
