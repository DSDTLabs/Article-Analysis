CHANDIGARH: More than a week ahead of its scheduled nationwide release, the Haryana government on Tuesday announced a ban screening of the controversial Sanjay Leela Bhansali film Padmaavat in the state. The BJP governments in Rajasthan, Gujarat and   have already banned the screening of the film.

 On Tuesday, the Haryana Cabinet headed by chief minister   formally approved of proposals made by two ministers Anil Vij and Vipul Goel to ban the controversial film in the state.
 
 “Film Padmavati/Padmavat banned in Haryana,” state’s health minister tweeted on Tuesday.
 
 The film had faced stiff opposition from some BJP leaders in Haryana. The two ministers had urged Smriti Irani, the minister of information and broadcasting, in November to ban the film.
 
 Controversial Haryana BJP leader Suraj Pal Amu, who had quit as party’s chief media coordinator in November, had led protests against the film and had even offered Rs 10-crore “reward” to “behead”   and Sanjay Leela Bhansali. He had, at the time, called the Haryana CM “so arrogant” for “humiliating” the Rajput community.
 
 Amu as well as Karni Sena were putting pressure on the Khattar government to ban the film. Amu had organised meetings on the issue in Panchkula, Bhiwani and other districts of Haryana and was very critical of the Haryana government. Other Rajput leaders like Deva Thakur too had announced they would launch a strike against the film.
 
 Thanking the chief minister, Amu said he wanted the film to be banned in other states and Union Territories as well. “CM Khattar toh mere chacha hain, unko main mana loonga. Thank you, Haryana government and CM Khattar. But, we shall continue our fight as this film has to be banned in the Union Territories as well as other states. We have already requested the Delhi CM   as well as lieutenant-governor to ban the film,” said Amu on Tuesday.
