NOIDA: The   buses will soon be given permit to ply on Yamuna expressway, minister of state (independent charge), transport,   said on Sunday.

Alternative routes can be allotted for the private buses.”
 
 Singh added the state government will also identify remote villages that will be identified and linked to cities through the Lohia gramin bus service run by  . Lohia gramin bus service project was one of the ambitious projects of the Akhilesh Yadav government. 
 
 “We will analyse the number of buses running under the Lohia gramin bus service and others running without a permit. Subsequently, new buses will be purchased for such villages,” Singh told the reporters at the residence of a BJP worker in Sector 35.
