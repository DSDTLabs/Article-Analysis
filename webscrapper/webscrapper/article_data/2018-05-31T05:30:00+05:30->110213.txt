Mysuru: In a bid to raise awareness about the need to save   River, considered the lifeline of South Karnataka, Cauvery Nadi Swachhta Andolana has organised an 18-kilometre walkathon from Mysuru to   on   (June 5).

 Lamenting the polluted condition of the river, state convener of the forum MN Chandramohan said, “Water from the river cannot be consumed directly. In order to highlight the gravity of this problem, we have organised a walkathon from Kote Anjaneya temple in Mysuru to Srirangapatna.”
 
 Chandramohan added that they would hold a cleanliness drive at Srirangapatna, and plant saplings to ensure that the ecological balance was preserved in the area. “We had undertaken a similar exercise last year. A walkathon was organised from Madikeri to Kushalnagar, which saw participation of the public in large numbers. We also planted saplings in large numbers,” he added.
 
 Chandramohan said that the district administration had extended its support to the walkathon. “The 18-kilometre walkathon will see at least 150 volunteers,” he said, adding that there was a need to start a Clean Cauvery campaign, along the lines of the Clean Ganga initiative advocated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
 
 Chandramohan said that they would start a postcard campaign, and one lakh letters would be sent to the PM to draw his attention to the problems faced by Cauvery. Urging the JD(S)-Congress government to establish a separate ministry to rejuvenate rivers, he said, “Only if a separate ministry to revive and save rivers is established, will our rivers be saved from going dry.”
