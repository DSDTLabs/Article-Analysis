New Delhi: The   on Tuesday gave a day’s time to the   to produce any rule or circular that “comes in the way” of implementing an agreement between Japanese major   and  .

 Justice S Muralidhar said, “in every private award, RBI cannot step in”, while asking the central bank to show the rule, regulation or circular which comes in the way of implementation of the award.
 
 The HC’s direction came after the RBI told HC it wants to have a fresh look into the $1.17-billion arbitral award granted in favour of DoCoMo.
 
 Senior advocate Soli Sorabjee, appearing for the RBI, told the court that the bank would not press its application to intervene in the matter if it can take a fresh look into the award granted in favour of DoCoMo.
 
 But the HC noted that “there is no point in going over it, all over again, when RBI has already undertaken the exercise (of looking into the award) twice over. It might be better to tell the court, whether there is any statutory provision or regulation barring transfer of money overseas under the award”.
 
 The RBI’s stand was also opposed by senior lawyers Kapil Sibal and Darius Khambata, appearing for   and Tata Son respectively and they submitted that last week the HC had asked the RBI to make its stand clear by showing the rule, regulation or circular under which the bank’s permission is required before transfer of money overseas under the award. The lawyers said the RBI cannot keep it open-ended by looking into afresh and an end to proceedings is required.
 
 The RBI on its part has opposed consent terms between   and DoCoMo on enforceability of the award granted in favour of the Japanese telecom major by the   ( ) in June 2016.
 
 The RBI has also contended that the shareholding agreement between the two companies, permitting transfer of funds abroad, was illegal as it violated the   ( ) Regulations.
