Panaji: While the BJP has already announced its candidate for the Rajya Sabha elections, the   is still holding its cards close to its chest. 

 Several names have been doing the rounds, but the crucial state election committee meeting is yet to be convened to decide on the candidate even as the deadline for filing nomination papers nears.
 
 With Goa Pradesh Congress Committee chief Luizinho Faleiro resigning, the focus has shifted on his probable successor. This has only served as a distraction in the party’s endeavour to find the right candidate to defend its Rajya Sabha seat.
 
 Party insiders indicate that for the Congress to retain Goa’s lone presence in the house of elders, its candidate has to be a loyal worker while simultaneously being able to curry favour among the ruling dispensation and its allies. “We are in consultation with all the other parties to find a suitable candidate,” said AICC’s Goa desk in-charge, A Chellakumar.
 
 “A proposal of two or three names was given for the post of Rajya Sabha, but if you see the numbers, we are not in a position to win,” a senior Congressman said.
 
 In the 40-member House, the current strength of MLAs stands at 38. The Congress, with 16 MLAs, needs the support of four more in the assembly if its candidate is to win the Rajya Sabha polls.
 
 However, some Congressmen are banking on cross-voting to help the Congress candidate sail through.
 
  “The BJP candidate will not get more than 10 votes. Whatever the circumstances, the candidate will be from the Congress itself. The name will be finalized in a day or two,” AICC secretary Girish Chodankar said.
