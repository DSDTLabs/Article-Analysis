Darshan Singh, brother of Aikom, said, “Tul Bahadur is being asked not to depose.”
 
 Mohali SSP Kuldeep Singh Chahal said, “The complaint has been marked to DSP Alam Vijay Singh. He will submit a report within two days, after which further course of action will be decided.”
 
 Tul Bahadur, named as one of the key witnesses by the police, is likely to depose in the court on the next date of hearing. In the initial statement to the police, he alleged that he was called by Seerat to help her load the suitcase in the BMW car. When he noticed blood coming out of it, he informed the police.
