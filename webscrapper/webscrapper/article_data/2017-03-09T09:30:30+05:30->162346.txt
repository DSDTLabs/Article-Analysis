JAIPUR: With an aim to revamp the organisational structure of state discoms, the government has proposed to open a new sub-division and circle offices in the next financial year.

 “For a long time, no new offices of state discoms have been opened. We will restructure the organisation and open new offices,’’ announced chief minister Vasundhara Raje, while presenting the Budget at Rajasthan assembly on Wednesday.
 
 She said that in the last three years, the power generation capacity in Rajasthan has increased by 5,086 MW. The department had issued 1.27 lakh new agriculture connections and 17.87 lakh new domestic connections. “This has been done despite the fact that the total debt on power companies in the state was Rs 72,724 crore in March 2014,” she said.
 
 She said that the department will establish two grid sub-stations (GSS) of 400 KV, six GSS of 220 KV, 15 GSS of 132 KV and 200 GSS of 33 KV in the next financial year. “The government will also allot 1 lakh new agriculture connections,” said the chief minister.
 
 Mentioning the state government’s recent decision to withdraw the hike in power tariff for agriculture connections, she said that this would mean an additional burden of Rs 1,000 crore on the exchequer.
 
 “The government was bearing a burden of Rs 7,500 crore to compensate the subsidy which will now rise to Rs 8,500 crore. The decision was done keeping in mind the interests of the farmers. However, I request them to help the state government in reducing distribution and transmission losses,” she added.
 
 Raje said that there is a growing demand for connections for drip irrigation, sprinkler and ‘diggi-based agriculture’ to be converted into regular agriculture connections.
