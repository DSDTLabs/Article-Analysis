KOLKATA: Hours after the Bengal Imam’s Association distanced itself from   Masjid Imam Noor-ur Rehman Barkati’s “unconstitutional” comments and his “arguing for other Muslim states,” the ruling Trinamool fielded two Cabinet ministers —   and Siddiqullah Chowdhury — as part of a damage control exercise.

 While Hakim rushed to Barkati’s house after he was asked to remove the “red beacon” from his car, the other minister and leader of West Bengal Jamiat-Ulema Hind held a press meet along with other Imams to say that Barkati was only adding fuel to the RSS-BJP game plan. “What the Tipu Sultan Masjid imam has said is his personal opinion and it is not the general feeling of the Muslims. We are Indian and we live in a secular country and we cherish the secular values,” Chowdhury said. The minister held that Barkati’s comments was actually helping the pro-Hindu parties to evoke sentiments against the minorities.
 
 Chowdhury echoed what Bengal Imam Association chairman   said on Barkati. “The Muslims of India are law abiding citizens. It is very unfortunate that a dignified man like Barkati has made such unconstitutional comments. We never demanded for a Muslim state or will never allow a Hindu rashtra. We have received several calls from the imams across Bengal condemning Barkati’s remarks,” the chairman said.   — who leads the Id prayer on Red Road — and Sahid Alam, trustee member of Tipu Sultan mosque Sahid Alam were also present at the press meet. “We will remove him (Barkati) very soon,” Alam said. 
 
 Replying to a question on why he was using the beacon light atop his SUV, the minister said, “I am a minister of this government and we believe that   government has taken a unilateral decision on this issue. We have written to the centre on this. If our chief minister or the government instructs me, I shall remove the light”.
