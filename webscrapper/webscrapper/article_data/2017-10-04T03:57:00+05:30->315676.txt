Colva: After authorities, upon the instructions of town and country planning minister Vijay Sardesai, prevented migrants from carrying out their trade of selling   at retail prices at the wholesale market at Margao, allegations began flying thick as fast that the minister was harassing and targeting the migrant community.

 While the minister was still on his rounds, he received a call from fisheries minister Vinod Palyekar informing him that the national president of the Federation of Lamanis complained to him about the harassment meted out to Lamanis in Goa who are carrying out their trade.
 
 “Let me reiterate that I am not against any community. I’m not a racist. I’m a proud Goenkar. I’m basically trying to prevent retail sale of fish in the wholesale market. We are basically trying to adhere to the law so that no one starts targeting any particular community,” Sardesai said.
