BHOPAL: The   has issued dress code for government teachers — maroon jacket for women and navy blue for men.

 Besides, they will have to put a name tab on their jacket with the legend ‘Rashtra Nirmata’ (maker of the nation), says a recent notification by the department. Signed by deputy secretary, school education,  , the notice says that teachers play an important role in shaping the future of the country, and how they dress is significant. 
 
 “For this, dress plays an important role. Dress not only brings uniformity but also ends personality differences,” says Dwivedi in the letter to commissioner, directorate public instructions. Citing the   conduct rules 2008, Dwivedi makes a case for the dress code.
 
 This will send 2.5 lakh government schoolteachers scrambling for blue and maroon jackets. Sources said National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) has designed the jacket and its colours. 
 
 School education minister Kunwar Vijay   had last year directed officials to complete all official formalities in this regard after a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shah had claimed that Madhya Pradesh will be the first state in the country to have dress code as “identity for teachers”. Its aim is to give teachers the identity as Rashtra Nirmata’, he said. After getting the directives, the education department started working on the code.
 
 According to Shah, the logic behind this decision was that teachers “should feel they are doing a great job” and that they can be identified from afar as government teachers.
