LUCKNOW: More than 120 small-scale industries in   and a few bordering   are left in the lurch as the lease of the land on which they had been operating for 90 years will not get renewed by its parent department  .

 
 LDA has decided to stop renewal of all plot leases. These industries would either have to look for industrial land elsewhere or buy the same land in an auction from LDA, which would cost a bomb.
 
 
  
 These plots have been under lease since 1921. Those which got land on lease in 1928 are due for renewal in 2018. The lease of many plots had already expired long ago. LDA has decided not to renew them but take custody of these plots for building housing and commercial projects.
 
 LDA vice chairman Prabhu N Singh said, “We cannot give land on lease now as per policy. Those who want to stay have to buy it in auction from us at the current DM circle rate. Since we need a big chunk of land to build affordable housing under the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY), we have decided not to renew the expired lease but build flats instead. I have asked the tehsildar to settle all such plots case by case.”
 
 LDA estimates that more than 3,000 flats under PMAY can be built in this area. The land is over 50 acres and there are around 571plots. Of these, 190 are industrial while the rest comprise residential areas. A few have got free-hold from LDA but a large part is surviving on leased land.
 
 Tehsildar Rajesh said, “We will first look for plots whose lease has already expired and take its right. Then we will take up cases of industries whose lease is about expire.”
