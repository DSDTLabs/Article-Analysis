PANAJI: The process to apply for a   passport has been simplified. Applicants no longer have to submit a   from designated authorities. The verification certificate that the public had difficulties obtaining, has now been dispensed with and replaced by a   certificate prescribed in annexure of the   Rules, 1980.

 Applicants above the age of 18 applying for a passport under the Tatkaal scheme, besides submitting their Aadhaar card have to submit any two out of 12 documents which include EPIC, state/central/ public sector undertaking/local bodies of public limited companies service photo identity card, SC/ST/OBC certificate, arms licence, pension document including ex-servicemen’s pension book/ pension payment order/ex-servicemen’s widow/dependent certificate/old age pension order, self-passport (unrevoked and undamaged), PAN card, bank/Kisan/post office passbook, student photo identity card issued by an educational institution, driving licence valid within the jurisdiction of the state of submission of applicant, birth certificate issued under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, ration card.
 
 For a child (under the age of 18) applying for a tatkaal passport, he/she besides submitting the Aadhaar card details must submit any one of the three documents including student photo identify card issued by an educational institution, birth certificate issued under Registration of Births and Deaths Act and ration card.
 
 For those applying under the tatkaal scheme, no proof of urgency is required, post police verification will be carried out in all cases, and passport authority will preferably issue the passport within a period of three working days from the date of submission of application.
 
 For those applying for a passport under the normal scheme without paying any additional tatkaal fee (on fast track basis), those above 18 will also have to submit a self-declaration and documents stated above. The new rules have come into immediate effect.
