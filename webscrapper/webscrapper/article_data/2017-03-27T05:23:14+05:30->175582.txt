NASHIK: The   police had effected 27   points to avert snarls in various narrow lanes across the city. But blatant flouting of the norms continues throughout the day without much visible police action. 

 For instance, on March 24, the traffic police found only 18 motorists who had flouted the no entry or one-way rule.
 
 In 2016, the police issued challans to 6,084 motorists for flouting the one-way norm. These motorists were among the total 2,03,439 booked for flouting the no entry norms. 
 
 Police said they booked erring motorists whenever they found them violating the norm. But the motorists should also voluntarily adhere to traffic   than waiting for the police to book them, they said.
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (traffic)   said, “We keep on taking action against the erring motorists. But it is difficult for the police to be present at every point and ensure all traffic rules are followed. Wherever possible, we have put up no-entry or one-way boards on various roads.” 
 
 He added, “At the same time, we come out with notifications from time to time if new roads are converted into one-ways for people’s information. The aim is to acquaint motorists with the new rules. But the rules are not followed by motorists in the absence of traffic police.”
 
 Other senior officials of the traffic police said there were one-way lanes, mainly in the old city area, where the streets are narrow and two-way traffic cause problem. The officials added that the motorists should adhere to the traffic norms for their own convenience. 
 
 The traffic police said they had a strength of around 200 personnel who had to manage vehicular flows in different parts of the city and also book those found violating rules. “Deploying a personnel to monitor every violation of the traffic norm was impossible,” an official said, adding that the department conducts specific drives frequently to focus on various norms violations.
