MUMBAI: In a relief for   Dargah Trust, Justice PD Naik of Bombay high court on Wednesday ordered status quo on a Rs 1.9 crore demand by city collector for cellular towers on its leased land. The HC restrained the state from initiating recovery proceedings till June 15. 

 Counsel Dipan Merchant appearing for the trust challenging the demand argued that a 2005 state decision to share 50% earned income was only for housing societies, but state's counsel   said it applied even to non-governmental and charitable institutions. 
 
 Merchant feared that recovery proceedings would affect the landmark shrine. The state lawyer submitted that the trust must not renew the few agreements with mobile companies, which are ending this month.
