LUDHIANA: Like every year, the district health department and municipal corporation officials have started making arrangements to prevent dengue from spreading in the city. 

 While health officials are conducting regular awareness drives, the MC has started fogging in high-risk areas once a day. On Wednesday, the health department is going to observe National Dengue Day to raise awareness about dengue among the masses and to appeal to them to curb the mosquito-borne virus at their homes and other places. 
 
 The health department claimed that one case of dengue was reported from Hargobind Nagar in April this year, so they had started checking water coolers, tyres and other places where there was problem of water stagnation. Though monsoon and the months after it are usually considered dengue season,officials are adopting preventive measures at this time as it has rained in recent past.
 
 Sources in MC said a large number of people caught dengue every year, but the health department could only count patients who got their blood sample tested at civil hospital. Private doctors hardly share information with health officials. The MC too believes that the actual number of cases are much higher than cases reported to them. 
 
 District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Kumar said were regularly checking places where there are chances of mosquitoes breeding and they found and destroyed larvae at 10 places. He said they would organize an awareness rally on Wednesday and it would be flagged off by deputy commissioner Pardeep Agrawal and civil surgeon Parwinderpal Singh Sidhu. He said people should not let fresh water accumulate anywhere in their house. 
 
 MC medical officer health Dr   said they were carrying out fogging in some high-risk areas with the help of big machines. “When dengue season will arrive, we will start intense fogging. We are also challaning people in whose houses larvae are found. So far, five challans have been issued,” he said.
