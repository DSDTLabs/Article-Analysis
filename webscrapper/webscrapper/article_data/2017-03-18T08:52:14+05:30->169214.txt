GUWAHATI: Assam Police have deployed two armed personal security guards for teenage singer Nahid Afrin because she faces a 'threat perception' after 46 Muslim clerics jointly described a musical night in her name in Hojai district as anti-Sharia. 

 Police have planned a security arrangement at the venue of the 'Nahid Afrin Musical Night' on March 25. Chief minister   tweeted 'directed DGP to conduct a thorough probe into the incident and provide adequate security to the singer.'
 
 In another tweet, the CM said, 'also directed Superintendent of Police of Hojai district to put effective mechanism in place to smoothly hold Nahid's programme on March 25' after Union minister for women and child development   wrote to Sonowal 'to ensure adequate protection to her so that she can pursue her talent.' Gandhi has also tweeted, "We have spoken to her father assuring Ms Afrin & her family that I am available for any help.'
 
 Sonowal, in his reply to Gandhi, tweeted, 'thank you@Manekagandhibjp ji for your concern & support. I have personally spoken to @NahidAfrin1 and assured full support from the state govt.'
 
  (Special Branch)   said, "There is a threat perception against Nahid. Based on the threat perception, we have put two security personnel with her and they will remain as long as the threat perception remains. Her function will be held." 
 
 The additional DG said Hojai district police is investigating the incident.
