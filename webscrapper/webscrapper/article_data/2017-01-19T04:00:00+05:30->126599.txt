Vadodara: The organizers of the 6th Solar Cookers International World Conference that concluded here on Wednesday will strive to include solar cooking in the sustainable development goals of the United Nations (UN).

 Co-chair of the conference Julie Greene said, “The conference was not merely for academic discussions but to plan and commit. Therefore we have decided to make representations to the UN for inclusion of solar cooking in sustainable development goals.” “Nations will realize the benefits when families who are away from energy sources will become energy independent,” added Greene.
 
 “Agencies that fund energy projects don’t know the technicalities and we are ready to offer our expertise to them,” said Greene “We are also going to write the Government of India to subsidize solar cookers in the country and expand its manufacturing facilities at the local level so that employment can also be generated,” said Dr Janak Palta, secretary of the conference..
