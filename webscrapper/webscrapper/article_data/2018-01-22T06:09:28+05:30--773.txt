MANALI: Contrary to the expectations of hoteliers and traders here, Kullu-Manali recorded a sharp decrease in tourist arrival in 2017, breaking the upward trend the region had seen over past few years. 

 As many as 36.37 lakh tourists, including 1.22 lakh foreigners, visited the district in 2016, creating a record as this was the highest ever number. Being the major tourist destination of Himachal, Manali had been witnessing a steady increase in the number of tourists every year.
 
 However, 2017 recorded arrival of 34.93 lakh tourists, including 1.30 lakh foreigners. The tourist department was also expecting an increase of about 10% in tourist arrival but the data provided by department revealed decrease of 1.44 lakh tourists in year.
 
 Kullu-Manali recorded 34.23 lakh tourists in 2015, 32.91 lakh in 2014, 28.86 lakh in 2013, 32.26 lakh in 2012 and 27.98 lakh tourists in 2011. Experts had thought that Manali will host over 38 lakh tourists in 2017 but the sharp drop in number has astounded all. The drop in number, according to experts, may continue in 2018 as well. These days, the town has less than 20% occupancy, thanks to dry weather conditions.
 
 Most of them hold   (NGT) order on   responsible for the dip. “Half of the tourists visiting Manali could not reach   to see snow. Lakhs of tourists comes to Manali to get respite from scorching heat of summers. NGT has limited number of vehicles to Rohtang. But the demand for taxis is double the limit. This resulted in many tourists going back disappointed. Many of them cancelled their plans to visit Manali,” hotelier   said.
 
 Another hotelier   said restrictions on many tourist activities were also responsible for decrease in tourist arrival. “Everybody visits Manali for snow and snow-related activities. Neither could they see snow nor could they do activities like riding snow scooters, which were all banned by administration following the NGT order. Limited number of taxis allowed to go to Rohtang resulted in bad practicing. Most taxis charged over Rs 10,000 fare just to cover both way distance of 102 km between Manali and Rohtang. This is three to four times of what tourist pay at all other major destinations. Many tourists could not afford this and had to cancel their trip to Manali.”
 
 Manali Hoteliers’ Association president   said tourists had to face some problems, especially during summer season, but things were returning to normalcy slowly. “We expect that all activities would be regulated. All tourists would be able to go to Rohtang Pass. Main problem tourist face is non-availability of flights and tough road journey to Manali. We will soon have four-lane highway which will bring tourist crowd to us,” he added.
