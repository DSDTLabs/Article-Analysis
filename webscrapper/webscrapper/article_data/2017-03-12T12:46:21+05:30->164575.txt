PANAJI: The Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party’s (MGP) expectations of a surge in its prospects did not materialize, but, nevertheless, the party managed to maintain its strategic position, retaining its three seats in the 40-member house, albeit with a change in face for two seats.

 While senior MGP leader and Madkai MLA Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar retained his seat, MGP president and Priol MLA Pandurang ‘Deepak’ Dhavalikar and Ponda MLA Lavoo Mamledar lost the 2017 assembly election. 
 
 Former Congressman Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar, who entered the party fold at the last minute, and Sanvordem candidate Deepak Pauskar helped the MGP retain its 2012 tally. Azgaonkar secured the Pernem seat for the party.
 
 The MGP had contested the elections on the medium of instruction (MoI) and employment issues, and had the support of the RSS rebel group.
 
 While the party has a track record of throwing its weight behind the majority party, on more than one occasion it has also withdrawn support to contest against the incumbent government.
 
 A few months before elections, MGP had demanded that chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar be sacked as CM citing non-performance on his part , a move which had resulted in the BJP dropping it from the government.
 
 A political observer said that MGP has never faced anti-incumbency as on most occasions it is they who have contested against the incumbent government
