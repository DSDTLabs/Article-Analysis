 The man is seen fervently asking for help from his amused friends who turn a deaf ear to his pleas and instead continue to take his videos on their mobiles. They are even heard poking fun of him. When a person asks him how he got trapped, the man tells him that someone asked him to go and check what was inside the cage, apparently with an intention of mischief. The cage has an auto-lock mechanism and he immediately got trapped inside.
 
 “What is so funny about this?...Please get me out from here...Take videos later,” the man is seen pleading with his two friends. They tell him that it was not possible for them to open the cage and scoff at him saying “keep lying there”.
 
 The man also tells them that he was very hungry and wants to go home. Sources said that the village is located somewhere on the banks of the   river. 
 
 The forest department often places cages in the forest areas adjoining villages after receiving complaints of leopards and other wild cats. However, this is the first time that a human being has got trapped in a cage.
 
 The video was widely shared in several WhatsApp groups and other social media platforms.
