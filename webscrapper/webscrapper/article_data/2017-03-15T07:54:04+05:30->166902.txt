BENGALURU: The   to be unveiled by chief minister   on Wednesday is likely to be loaded with sops for drought-hit farmers and populist measures which will help the Congress consolidate its vote base.

 The budget will be Siddaramaiah's best opportunity to shore up support before the 2018 assembly elections and the Nanjangud and Gundlupet bypolls in April. But it's not an easy ride for Siddaramaiah, given that Karnataka's resource mobilization was hit following demonetization. It will be a record 12th budget for Siddaramaiah, who also holds the finance portfolio.
 
 Populist measures have been a mainstay of Siddaramaiah's budgets since he took over the state's reins in 2013. The focus has been on Ahinda (acronym for dalits, backward classes and minorities) and low-income families in rural areas, where the ruling Congress gleans a large chunk of votes. Sources say Siddaramaiah is likely to stick to his previous for mula of making it a budget driven more by “political calculations“. “It's a matter of `what can we do to be popular enough', said a Congress leader.
 
 Among the biggest measures, Siddaramaiah is expected to announce a farm loan waiver for farmers reeling under successive droughts, and plans to extend the goodies beyond the government's traditional Ahinda vote bank. The chief minister sees it as the most effective tool to counter the BJP in the poll battle and brand the Modi government “anti-farmer“.
