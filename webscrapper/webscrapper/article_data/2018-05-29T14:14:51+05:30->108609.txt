COIMBATORE: Changing the   for vocational groups after eight years, the school education department has reduced the number of practical examinations and introduced a Computer subject to all the vocational groups irrespective of their genre.

 Unlike the previous years when students, irrespective of the group they chose, had to study only Computer Science, the department has split the Computer-based subjects into three – Computer Science, Computer Applications and  .
 
 While the students opting for Arts and Science and Accountancy-related vocational groups would be studying Computer Applications, vocational group students would be studying Computer Technology, as per the government order.
 
 “Ten out of 12 vocational groups have Computer Technology as a theory subject,” pinpointed A Nallappan, who teaches vocational groups. How much will the students learn from technology as a theory subject, he asked, explaining that the vocational groups were started with an aim to assist the students in search of employment.
 
 Earlier, every stream had two practical subjects and the students studied in-depth about the particular stream. The teacher said that the two practical subjects were merged into one and a computer-based subject was included in all the streams irrespective of their genre.
 
 Meanwhile, Accountancy teachers said that instead of Computer Applications, it would have been much help if the department had included Tally for Accountancy group students. M Madavan of Tamil Nadu Agriculture Graduate Teachers association said that they had been urging the department to include Science subjects to increase the higher   opportunities for the students of Agriculture stream.
 
 Meanwhile, sources in the book preparation team said that a common subject was introduced due to lack of sufficient time to prepare new content related to the every stream, as the decision to create new syllabus was taken very late.
