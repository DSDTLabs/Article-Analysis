 Workers of all the 16 blocks of Congress party in the city agitated at   and dragged their cars with ropes as mark of their protest against price hike. Fuel prices are still rising on 12th consecutive day in the country. In Jaipur petrol prices touched 80.06 paisa and diesel reached Rs 73.21 per litre.
 
 Congress party workers warned the state government to reduce the VAT and cess on petrol and diesel and give the public some relief. The party will observe ‘Vishwasghaat Divas’ nationwide on May 26 to protest against the fuel hike. In Jaipur, Congress party workers will gather at Collectorate Circle Park, Bani Park to protest.
 
 Khachariyawas said that BJP party is very arrogant and in international market when crude oil rates were low then the government increased the excise duty 17 times and didn’t let the benefit reach the masses. “During 2014 elections BJP’s slogan was ‘Ab aur nahi petrol diesel ki maar, ab ki baar Modi sarkaar’ but we can see the current scenario. After Independence fuel prices are at their peak. Our Prime Minister is silent on these issues and no one is there to listen to the plight of the common man,” said Khachariyawas.
