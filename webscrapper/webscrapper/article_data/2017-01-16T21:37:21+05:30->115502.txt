Actor   is all set to get hitched! The actor took to Twitter to announce who   is. The Soodhu Kavvum actor has been in love for the past two years with  . 

 ���I have known her for the past six years. I was looking for love elsewhere, but I never realised the girl of my life was right in front of me. We never had a formal proposal, I guess we just liked each other and it was mutual. I right away went to her house and spoke to her folks. Her father is the late stunt master Rambo Rajkumar. Her family agreed. When I spoke to my mother, she was very happy, too. Thankfully, both the families did not have any issues,��� shares the elated actor. 
 
 Talking about marriage plans, he says, ���A lot of my friends in the industry knew about our relationship, but I had to make it official. So, I thought I could announce it on New Year���s. She is a very supportive person, who has always encouraged me when it comes to my choice of films. Thankfully, she and her family know how the industry works. She respects the industry a lot and is also open when it comes to criticism. She will tell me upfront if a film is not good. That���s the good thing about her. We are planning to get married some time this year.���
