LUCKNOW: Row over distribution of sweets during dinner led to violence and vandalism at Central Mess of the   on Tuesday night.

 As bouncers deployed for discipline in the mess failed to control the situation, more than 100 personnel from Aliganj,   and Mahanagar police stations were rushed to the spot.

 The staff refused and told students there was only one bowl for each student. There was a heated argument followed by a scuffle between staff and students. When bouncers asked the students to leave, they pelted stones from outside. Hasanganj police inspector PK Jha said, “We told LU authorities to close gates of all hostels to prevent their residents from entering the mess.“
 
 According to the hostellers, “There was insufficient food and when we asked the staff to cook some more, they asked us to have leftovers.“
 
 LU chief proctor   said, “A notice was served to the mess in charge on Tuesday as he had handed over services to another person without informing the university.“ SP trans-Gomti   said LU officials had not lodged any complaint.This was the fourth incidence of indiscipline at Central Mess since it was opened in August but LU has not lodged FIR in any of the cases.
