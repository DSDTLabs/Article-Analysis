MOHALI: Zirakpur, Kharar and Mohali MC's will jointly buy local buses, Dera Bassi legislator   said during the TOI roundtable conference after residents pointed out lack of proper public transport system in Zirakpur.

 “We have got the proposal approved.It will be implemented soon. The district transport office has marked the routes, which have been proposed to the RTO,“ he said. He added that they will request general manager   to re-introduce the CTU connectivity at VIP road.
 
 Residents also complained that the lack of public transport connectivity has been burning a hole in their pockets.“We have to depend on our own vehicle or hire a cab,“ said one of the residents.
 
 Dinesh Malhotra, a resident of VIP road, highlighted the plight of the elderly citizens and said, “There is poor connectivity of local buses on VIP road.Earlier CTU had introduced bus services on this road. It was a sparsely populated area then. The service was called off due to a poor response,“ he said. Today, the area is thickly populated and especially the elderly, feel the need to use public transportation.
 
 Resident  , too, sounded worried about the senior citizens.“They depend on their pension. It is not possible for them to hire a cab or auto rickshaw to commute daily. The local bus connectivity between Zirakpur and Chandigarh will give relief to the elderly,“ he said.
