Missing all the fun outdoor because of the sweltering heat? But there are some peeps who are in no mood to give up on their plans with friends, come what may. Our photog captured them on his lens at one of the pubs as they stepped in to unwind after a hard day at work. As the shutterbugs zoomed in their cameras on them, Saurab, Saybanthi, Ankita and Menaka were all gleaming, for, they were having a memorable nightout with their dear ones. 

 Behind the music console was Veekay who had the playlist ready to entertain the guests. Once he got started, there was no stopping him. The dance floor was packed. Every now and then, they would come back to their tables for a sip and some quick bites, and be ready for another round of groovy moves.
