ANKLESHWAR: A joint investigation committee (JIC) comprising officials from various government departments has started a survey of shops in the scrap markets between Ankleshwar and Panoli on National Highway (NH)-8 on Monday. The JIC, which was set up by the district collector after a series of fire incidents in the scrap markets within a short span of time, will be checking registration papers of the shops and the mode of disposal of waste by them among other things. 

 Many owners of godowns and shops operating without licence in Adarsh, Mahavir, Nobel, Navjeevan and   scrap markets ran away seeing the government vehicles, leaving behind HDPE drums, carboys, machinery parts, insulators, colling towers, plastic bags, etc. Some could not show bills for the materials lying in their premises while many had encroached upon the government land.
 
 The team headed by S K Vasava, scientific officer,   (GPCB) will submit its report to sub-divisional magistrate after 10 days. R G Chaudhri, an officer of Directorate Industrial Safety and Health; N V  , police inspector, GIDC police station; and R S Parmar, mamlatdar, Ankleshwar, are among other members of the committee.
