PUNE: The Pune railway division authorities may keep a record of ticketless travellers as periodic drives and fines have failed to bring about the desired change in the mindset of people, especially those commuting by trains on   section.

 “Between April last year and January this year, Rs 6.32 crore has been collected in fines from 1.13 lakh people for travelling ticketless in trains in  , Pune-Miraj and   sections. The thing which strikes is that maximum number of ticketless travellers were caught in the Pune-Lonavla section, train fare of which is just Rs 15,” Pune rail division PRO   said.
 
 He said several drives are held against ticketless travellers, but they have failed to bring about desired result. “We will start keeping the record of such people, including their names, addresses, pictures, contact details, if things do not improve. If we find the same person travelling without ticket, his or her name will be displayed at the stations as a habitual offender,”   said.
 
 The Pune rail division has got a total of 75 stations in all. There are around 15 stations in the Pune-Lonavla section.
