RAJKOT: Rajkot district administration has made it mandatory to install rooftop solar power units in all new buildings coming up in Rajkot district including six municipalities and villages which falls under   (RUDA).

 According to Rajkot district collector Dr.  , the new norms will be in force from Thursday onwards.
 
 “The decision was taken to promote rooftop solar energy policy of the state and central governments. We want to make implementation of the new solar policy quick and hope that people will benefit from from it and save money from power bill,” Pandey told TOI.
 
 “We will promote rooftop solar power policy in urban and semi-urban areas of Rajkot. We have rooftop solar panels at our collector’s office and on an average, we save 30% electricity cost,” the collector added.
 
 “We want to set an example of speedy implementation of the policy and promote green technology,” said Pandey, who is also chairman of RUDA.
 
 Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has already made rooftop solar panels mandatory for all buildings in Rajkot city. 
 
 RMC has last year approved 110 KW solar power project at its West Zone office besides existing 90KW solar power plant. The civic body has already initiated a process to convert all 52,000 street lights into LED to save electricity.
 
 Currently, RMC has installed Solar PV system at its three zonal offices, three swimming pools and 10 schools in the city.
 
 Also, the commercial capital of Saurashtra was declared the National Earth Hour Capital 2016 in WWF’s global Earth Hour City Challenge (EHCC) for various initiatives to reduce carbon emission and encourage renewable energy through community engagement last year.
