LUCKNOW: For the first time, UP is going to announce a  .   ( ) has submitted the   (ARR) to the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission ( ) for three consecutive financial years, beginning 2017-18. The ARR (TOI has a copy) projects a prospective hike in   up to 40%.

 The multi-year power tariff structure, that determines electricity rates for more than one year has already been implemented by most of the states in the country but UP had yet to implement it, essentially for political reasons.
 
 Incorporating the Centre’s ambitious ‘Power For All’ and UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) Scheme, the UPPCL’s ARR document projects an increase in revenue requirement from the existing Rs 60,153 crore to over Rs 71,000 crore in 2017-18, over Rs 90,000 crore in 2018-19 and over Rs 1 lakh crore in 2019-20. The corporation would soon submit a formal tariff revision proposal. Sources said the electricity regulator would examine UPPCL proposals before announcing a revised power tariff.
 
 UPERC sources said going by UPPCL’s fresh ARR, tariff revision appears inevitable. “If the current tariff continues, the revenue gap will increase alarmingly, given the state government commitment to provide 24-hour power supply to all consumers,” a senior UPERC official said.
 
 The UPPCL has noted that the revenue gap may increase from the existing around Rs 8,000 crore to over Rs 20,000 crore by the end of this financial year. It would subsequently shoot to around Rs 27,000 crore by 2019 and then to over Rs 32,000 crore by 2020. Power experts said the gap threatens to get wider each year with the state government promising 24-hour power supply to sectors like agriculture which yield less or almost no revenue at a time when cost of power from various sources has been rising.
 
 The state government, as a practice, has been cross-subsidising the agriculture and rural supply feeders by imposing higher tariff on industries and urban domestic and commercial consumers. “The huge power pilferage and commercial losses are only adding to the problem of low revenue recovery,” an energy department official said.
 
 The multi-year tariff planning, said UPERC officials, will push for an exhaustive planning and rigorous monitoring by distribution companies over a longer period of time. “While discoms perform fairly, others lag behind in revenue collection and checking power theft, resulting eventually in heavy loss to state exchequer,” a senior UPERC official said. If successful, the tariff plan will be extended for a period of five years, said sources.
