NAVI MUMBAI: The city’s police commissionerate got a dedicated ambulance from a well-known hospital on the penultimate day of the road safety week. The service will help the cops to rush accident victim to the hospital during the golden hour, said sources.

 DCP (Traffic), Nitin Pawar said, “The hospital will also provide services of three more ambulances that they can avail in any emergency besides the one that they have provided to the department.” 
 
 Joint CP, Madhukar Pandey added that there are also seven Dial 108 ambulances available in the city.
 
 But sources said that hiring an ambulance during an emergency was difficult and even the Dial 108 service was not very prompt. “The police had to often stop passing vehicles to ferry the victim or people come forward for help,” they added.
 
 While the cops claim that there has been a significant decrease in number of accidents in 2016, statistics show that the year saw just four less deaths compared to 2015. It may be pointed out that 317 people died in road accidents while 555 met with serious injuries in 2016.
 
 It is not just the city police which lacks this basic facility. There are just two ambulances on the  , which have been provided by the contractor. 
 
 Sources said NGOs and other bodies gifted an ambulance to   but there are issues about maintenance.
