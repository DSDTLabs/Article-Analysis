 “Ever Cars has been dodging vacating this prime property for many years through various methods including court litigation,” said authorities.
 
 Prior to this, HMRL authorities had reclaimed a 2,800 square yard space located near  , in between   and railway stations.
 
 The ₹28 crore worth GHMC property was occupied by a private taxi association for more than a decade. The land will be used to develop a bus and vehicle bay and a parking hub with modern amenities for commuters at the Nampally Metro station, said authorities.
 
 “Instructions have already been issued to demolish the shed of the property at Ameerpet and the walls to be dismantled since there have been instances where those occupying such lands have managed to get stay orders from lower courts. Meanwhile, iron pillars and gates have been fixed at the property in Nampally after HMRL has taken control of it,” said N V S Reddy, Managing Director, HMRL.
