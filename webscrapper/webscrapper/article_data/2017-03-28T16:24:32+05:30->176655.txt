NEW DELHI: Australia captain   has apologised for losing control during the course of the four-Test series against India. On Tuesday, India beat Australia by eight wickets in the fourth and final Test in Dharamsala to win the series 2-1.

 Speaking at the post-match presentation, Steve Smith said, "It's been pretty intense throughout the series. At times, I have lost control over my emotions. I apologise for that."
 
 On Monday, video clips showed Smith using cuss words against Murali Vijay after the Indian fielder had claimed a catch and started rushing towards the dressing room to put his pads on. Replays showed the catch wasn't cleanly taken and following that video emerged of Smith apparently calling Vijay "f*****g cheat."
 
 Smith had brilliant series, scoring 499 runs, the most by any batsmen from either side and hit three centuries to top the batting charts. The 27-year-old said that this was one of the best series of his playing career. " (This is) Probably one of best Test series I've been part of. The way we adapted & challenged Indian in these conditions was really fantastic," he said.
 
 The hotly contested series gave rise to several controversies and reached to a level that forced the cricket boards of the two teams brokering a pre-match meeting between Smith and India captain   to ensure peaceful proceedings ahead of the third Test in Ranchi. But, it did not seem to have much effect as the intense rivalry and mind-games continued resulting in more controversial moments including one where   could be seen mocking Kohli's shoulder injury and in turn the Indian accusing the Australians of showing disrespect to India physio  .
 
 Smith praised India and particularly their bowlers for stepping up on Day 3. "Credit to India, they bowled particularly well yesterday. Umesh Yadav has bowled brilliantly all series," he said.
