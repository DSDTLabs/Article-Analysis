VISAKHAPATNAM:   Ltd group general manager Arupratan   said on Saturday that hectic challenges lie ahead for the organisation due to rapid changes — from traditional energy generation processes to renewable energy trends like solar and wind. However, despite the odds, NTPC has managed to sustain itself and is doing well, he added. Talking to the media at NTPC’s thermal power plant unit at Simhadri on the outskirts of the city, Maiti said they are now procuring coal even from Singareni Collieries Co Ltd in   in addition to its existing sources in the northern states. Nearly eight to nine rakes of coal are required per day, but due to shortage from the existing sources, they have started procuring coal from Singareni, he added.

 NTPC spends Rs 5-6 crore annually to help the society under its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programme. Recently, it spent around Rs 1.5 crore for an educational institution at Parawada, which is close to the plant, he added. 
 
 “Overall, we are exploring various possibilities on how to run the plant as per the needs of present-day scenario amid hectic competition from other energy generation units like solar,” Maiti added.
