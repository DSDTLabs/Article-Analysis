CHANDIGARH: Punjab has become the first state in the country to introduce an   programme after an agreement signed with the Foundation for Innovative   (FIND) on World Hepatitis Day on Friday.

 Punjab health minister   said on Friday that the foundation would support the state health department by providing rapid test kits for screening of high risk patients like HIV and IVDU (Intravenous Drug Users) coming for treatment of hepatitis C.
 
 The health department will be introducing RUPs (reuse prevention syringes) in the state so that blood-borne infections were not spread. Mohindra said WHO and the state health department would work together in sensitizing general public regarding safe injections.
 
 FIND will also provide 4 Gene Xpert machines to be installed at Sangrur, Bathinda, Tarn Taran and Hoshiarpur for free testing of viral load among these high risk group patients. The remaining districts will be connected to these 4 centres for viral load testing. The health minister said FIND would fund the staff for running these machines.
 
 Mohindra said, “With support from WHO, we are releasing the action plan for injection safety programme, Punjab is the first state in the country where injection safety programme is being implemented in collaboration with WHO.”
