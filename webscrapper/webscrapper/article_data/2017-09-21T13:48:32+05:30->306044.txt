NAGPUR: The city  , at an emergent meeting of its executive body held at Devadia Bhavan on Wednesday, decided to launch public protests against the government for its failure to control prices of petrol and diesel.

 The protest will be launched on September 26 with a massive public march starting from Shahid Chowk. It will pass through Itwari and culminate at Mahal. Later, smaller protests would be held at block level, said city unit president Vikas Thakre.
 
 The meeting was dominated by Muttemwar-Thakre group which controls it while senior party leaders and ex -ministers Satish Chaturvedi, Nitin Raut and Anees Ahmed kept away.
 
 In a major move, the meeting passed a resolution in which strict disciplinary action was sought against those party leaders responsible for ink attack on   president Ashok Chavan during an election campaign meeting for   polls in February. The resolution was moved by Umakant Agnihotri and seconded by Abhijit Wanjari. The resolution will be forwarded to MPCC. Thakre said that there was anger among party men who felt that the rebel leaders were hand-in-glove with   stalwart Nitin Gadkari and on his directions, formed a separate group in NMC under corporator Tanaji Vanve. The party workers were ready to stage a protest at AICC office in New Delhi to seek action against rebels.
 
 In yet another move, the city Congress has decided to organize celebrations on October 2 (Gandhi jayanti), November 14 (Nehru birthday), November 19 (Indira Gandhi centenary year conclusion), November 26 (Constitution Day) and December 28 (Congress inception day).
