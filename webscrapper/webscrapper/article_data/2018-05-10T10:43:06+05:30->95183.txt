LUCKNOW: Criticising the   for dividing the society on caste and communal lines,   chief Akhilesh Yadav lamented that the ruling party, beset with a "feudal mindset", was refusing to recognise backwards as Hindus. 

 Addressing a function on the birth anniversary of Maharana Pratap at the party headquarters, Akhilesh said that BJP leaders including CM Yogi Adityanath were vitiating the society with the poison of casteism and communalism by their unsavoury words and acts.
 
 The SP chief regretted that the poor backwards and the Dalits were not being acknowledged even as human beings by the CM, who described them as "snakes and moles". 
 
 This was highly objectionable and indicative of a feudal mindset, lashed out the SP chief, claiming that the political situation though was changing and an anti-BJP wave was sweeping the nation.
 
 Akhilesh said that like the two byelections in March, the Opposition will defeat the BJP in Kairana and Noorpur.
 
 Exhorting the Rajputs, who had gathered in large numbers at the function, Akhilesh remarked, " Aap meri pagdi ka samman kariye, hum aapko kuchch bhi nahin hone denge" (If you protect our honour, we will ensure no harm is done to you). Programme convener and former minister Arvind Singh Gope said the Rajputs were known for their commitment, valour and courage and were ready to sacrifice anything while fighting injustice.
