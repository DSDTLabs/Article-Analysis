Five-and-a-half years ago, actress   quit a thriving career on television for the greener pastures of Bollywood. However, that was not meant to be. With her dreams shattered, Via is back now, yearning for a second innings on the small screen. And this time around, she’s not courting success; rather, it’s a question of survival.
The actress, who had featured in several shows, including ' ', ' ', ' ' and ' ', fell on hard times after her movie career failed to take off. She says, “I quit TV to pursue films. I didn’t appreciate the way television industry functioned; it was disorganised. There were times when the shoot continued for two-three days without a break. Erratic lifestyle took a toll on my health and that’s when I decided to try movies. I shot for a film, but it got stuck. It has been almost three years and they are still hoping for it to release.”
 The fate of her debut film left Via disillusioned and depressed. “I went into a shell and slowly, slipped into depression. I wouldn’t step out of my home for days on end. I stopped communicating with people and wouldn’t even eat properly. I would scream at people for the silliest of reasons. In short, I didn’t want to live,” she says.
 With no work and income, a financial crisis was inevitable. Via recalls, “Initially, I sustained on my savings, but the funds soon ran dry. I had to sell my car and depend on public transport today.”
 However, tough times have taught her some invaluable, practical lessons. “My financial crisis has forced me to plan a comeback. I want to get back on TV because I am the only earning member in my family,” she says.
 With the current surge of younger actors, she isn’t even vying for lead roles anymore. “I just want good roles,” she answers.
