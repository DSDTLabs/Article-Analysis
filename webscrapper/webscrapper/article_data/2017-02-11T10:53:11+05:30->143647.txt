BENGALURU: A woman lodged a complaint with the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights ( ) against her daughter's school for allegedly making the   

 M Suja's (name changed) Facebook post, where she explained how her child, in nursery, had to go through the "horrifying experience" at her Ulsoor school, got roaring responses from angry parents. Suja accused the class teacher of physically punishing her daughter.
 
 "Each morning started with her crying & requesting me not to send her to school. At first I ignored her as I thought maybe she needs time to adjust in her new school. But later when I ask her the reason of her daily crying, she told me that her class teacher used to beat her regularly," stated Suja's post.
 
  Despite requests to the class teacher, there was no stopping, claimed Suja. Her post reads: "Then I decided to complain to Principal & her initial statement was 'No we don't beat any kids here as beating is banned in school' but her last sentence was 'A teacher doesn't have any other way to instill discipline other than beating'." 
 
  Suja says the teachers have opted for another way of punishing the kids - by pulling their pants down. "Pulling down the pants of kids forcefully & making the rest of the class taunt 'shame shame puppy shame' is so humiliating. My child has cried so much that I can see the difference in her attitude these days too," said the post. A   was registered by KSCPCR against the school and the principal was summoned.
