MANDSAUR:   waiting for their produce to be sold in   are now being treated to   and given cool sheds to rest in the hope that it will ease tempers ahead of the 10-day kisan protest due to start on June 1.

 
 The placating steps came after skirmishes were reported among farmers and mandi officials over the slow pace of procurement. Some farmers have had to wait for four days with their produce loaded on tractor trolleys and trucks before their chance comes.
 
 “Though resting facility is available for a limited number of people at mandis, instructions have been issued to all   to arrange for shade and refreshment, including buttermilk, for waiting farmers,” district collector O P Shrivastava told TOI. Serpentine queues stretch for kilometers outside mandis. As they wait, the discussions that go on among farmers range from shrinking profit margins to the towering payments they will have to make to truck-tractor owners. Gopal Singh, a farmer from  , who hopes to get inside the mandi on Friday, said, “I have been here for three days. I have my own vehicle. With a load of around 40 quintals, I will walk away with only enough to last barely a month. Why is that I have to take such pains to sell my produce of garlic?”
 
 Officials claim lack of local storage space has led to such a situation. “Here, we can allow around 150 vehicles to enter the mandi at a time. There is limited storage space. Once it is filled, we send it to Ratlam. It takes around 24 hours for trucks to return after unloading. Till then, we have to manage with the available space,” Shrivastava said. Police have been deployed in mandis and surrounding areas to prevent any flare-up.
 
 At the same time, the farmers are being approached and counselled to prevent them from losing control. As the clock ticks down to the 10-day gram bandi, where farmers have vowed not to sell any of their produce in urban areas, the administration is keeping a close watch on the situation.
