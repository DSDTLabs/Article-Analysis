Nagpur: System Research Society has organized a seminar as part of the ongoing ‘Don’t you waste food’ campaign at Hotel Centre Point, Ramdaspeth, at 3pm on Saturday.

 The seminar will discuss measures to be undertaken to curb wastage of food.
 
 Mayor Nanda Jichkar will inaugurate the meet while pro vice-chancellor of Nagpur University Pramod Yeole, principal of MSS Institute of Social Work John Menachery, director of National Service Scheme Keshav Walke and principal of Mahila Mahavidyalaya Mrunalini Fadnavis will be present.
 
 The campaign is aimed at creating awareness among people as one third of food is either spoiled or squandered before it is consumed. This loss could be avoided if people adopt good habits, the organization said. When lakhs of people are facing hunger, it is the duty of the society that it did not waste food and take immediate steps to stop it. Food thus saved can help the society at large, the organizations added.
