KOLKATA: For the second match in a row, Kolkata Knight Riders were undone by an individual brilliance of a player from the rival team. While   captain   was at his destructive best against Kolkata in Hyderabad, a little-known youngster emerged as the unlikely hero at the   on Wednesday.

 Pune opener   hit a match-winning 52-ball 93 on Wednesday to help his team chase down Kolkata's meager tally of 155/8 with relative ease and keep them in the hunt for a play-off berth.
 
 Picked up at his base price of Rs 10 lakh at the   auction earlier this year, the Pune boy has been one of the shining stars of the tournament this season. With 353 runs from nine matches, the opener has not only emerged as the highest run-getter of the side but also outshone big stars like skipper  ,  , MS Dhoni and others.
 
 Talking about his own innings after the match, Tripathi said he had no plans whatsoever for any Kolkata bowler and played every ball on merit.
 
 "I think that worked well. Going in with a plan wouldn't have worked because they (Kolkata) are a great bowling side," Tripathi was quoted as saying on the tournament's official website (iplt20.com). "I just kept it simple and went with my gut feeling," he added.
 
 A team man to the core, Tripathi said he didn't regret missing out on a century. "I would have loved to finish the match which was certainly more important. But in the end, we won."
 
 Kolkata pacer   was also all praise for the 26-year-old and felt Tripathi had actually fared better than Warner. "It's always difficult to stop a player on his day. He just played a fantastic knock, so all credit to him," he said.
