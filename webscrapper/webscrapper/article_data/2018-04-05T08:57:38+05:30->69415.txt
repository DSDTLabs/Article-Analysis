HYDERABAD: If you've been wondering about the driving skills of many of those zipping around on the city's roads, you are not way off the mark. An analysis of data available with the   ( ) throws up a worrying trend-a high number of untrained drivers are currently vrooming around on the city's roads, posing a risk to the life and limb of commuters. 

 While over six lakh people were issued learner's licences (LLs) across Hyderabad in 2017, the number of those who obtained permanent driving licences (DLs) stood below 4.5 lakh.
 
 Experts have raised an alarm over the marked difference between the number of student drivers and the number of trained permanent license holders in the city, that stood at over 2.1 lakh in 2017.
 
 "Lack of proper driving skills can cause serious road mishaps. The test people take for a learner's licence is not sufficient for them to understand nuances of driving on busy city roads. It is mandatory that student drivers be accompanied by a guardian or instructor, who is a licence holder. But this rule is ignored by many in Hyderabad. No enforcement drive is being carried out to keep a check," said  , CEO, Indian Federation of Road Safety (IFROS).
 
 He said many countries follow a three-stage process for a learner to obtain a license -the learner stage, intermediary stage and final leg. In India, the intermediary stage does not exist.
 
 "Sometimes without physically taking the test, permanent licenses can be obtained by paying a fee," said a local.
