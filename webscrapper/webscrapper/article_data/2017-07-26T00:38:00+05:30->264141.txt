Karur: A 24-year-old woman and her 27-year-old lover were found dead under mysterious circumstances at the former’s house in Karur district on Monday.

 Police said the death of D Shanmugapriya, of Kuttakadai in Karur, and her lover R Vinod, of Palayam in Tiruvarur district, came to light when Shanmugapriya’s mother Gowri Sankari found their bodies inside the house on Monday evening. While Shanmugapriya’s body was found lying on the floor, Vinod was hanging from the ceiling.
 
 As Sankari shouted for help, her neighbours rushed there and informed the Karur town police. Police found strangulation marks on Shanmugapriya’s neck. Both bodies were sent for postmortem to Karur Government Medical College Hospital. 
 
 Police investigation confirmed that the two have been in love for several years since the time they were studying in a private engineering college in Karur. Vinod used to meet Shanmugapriya at her house when her mother was not at home. As usual they had met on Monday too. 
 
 However, police are baffled as to what caused the death of the two. It was said that Shanmugapriya got a job offer in a firm in Chennai and decided to join. Police suspect that Vinod might have compelled her not to take up the job and the argument could have ended up in the death.
