Shimla: Expressing concern over the unplanned and haphazard constructions taking place all around the town and the increasing number of vehicles lessening the charm of the town, Dr Arun Sharma, secretary (education), said that heritage of Shimla needs to be preserved for future generations. 

 Sharma said this in his keynote address at the day-long conference on ‘Preserving Heritage of Shimla’ organized by Happy Hikers Shimla on Thursday. He said that every place had its own charm and Shimla happened to be one of the historical towns, which had a glorious past of being pedestrian and car-free town since its inception. He further said that pedestrians had the first right to walk on roads and people here loved to move around freely in the pristine pollution-free environment. He said that heritage was not limited to monumental infrastructures but also included environment, traditions and customs and these need to be preserved. He also suggested that there should be a limit to the number of vehicle entering the town so that roads did not get choked.
 
 Former director of information and public relations B D Sharma said that it was the duty of every resident of Shimla town to contribute pro-actively towards the preservation of the rich heritage. He said that the flora and fauna were on the verge of extinction due to ecological degradation and increase in construction activities. 
 
 During the conference others speakers also expressed concern over the shrinking car-free area. They said that self-discipline was the best remedy to preserve the rich heritage of the town besides putting a complete stop to the concrete jungle growth. Speakers said that unless remedial steps were not taken in time the situation could worsen in coming years.
