CHANDIGARH: A day after Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari spoke in favour of bringing petrol and diesel under the goods and service tax ( ) to control rising prices,   president   blamed the state government for neither coming forward on the issue nor reducing value added tax (VAT) on the two fuels.

 “The Centre is ready, but states are not ready.   government is not reducing VAT on fuel. Prices in Punjab are more that neighbouring Haryana and Himachal Pradesh,” said Malik. 
 
 He said there was no need for   president   and local bodies’ minister Navjot Singh Sidhu to ride a bullock cart, like they did while campaiging for the Shahkot assembly byelection campaign on Friday, to protest against the rise in prices of fuel. “Instead, the state government should focus on reducing VAT on fuel,” he said.
 
 Malik explained central government’s excise on petrol was Rs 19.41 and Rs 15.53 on diesel. He said Punjab has been charging Rs 35.05 as VAT on petrol and Rs 16.68 on diesel. In Haryana, VAT on petrol is Rs 26.25 and Rs 17.22 on diesel. Himachal Pradesh charges Rs 24.36 as VAT on petrol and Rs 14.34 on diesel. In Chandigarh, Rs 19.41 is VAT on petrol and Rs 15.33 on diesel, said Malik.
 
 Replying to a question, the Punjab BJP president said he would speak to Union finance minister Arun Jaitely and the PM to keep langar served at Golden Temple out of GST. “I have full faith that GST will not be levied on langar,” he said. 
 
 Asked about Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal saying she would resign if the central government did not keep langar out of GST, Malik said it was her individual decision.
 
 Malik blamed state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal for less collection of GST in Punjab when compared to other states. “He has failed. Even SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal has said Manpreet was inefficient in the earlier government,” he said.
