INDORE: A   on Monday directed police to register a   against a woman for beating her paralysed husband and mother-in-law. The woman had voiced intentions to marry again barely a week after her husband suffered the paralytic attack. 

 The court was told by the mother-in-law and husband's counsel that she fled to her parents' home within five days of him suffering the attack and also stole his ATM card, cash and jewellery. Judicial magistrate first class Amodh Arya directed the women's police station to register a case under Section 12 of Protection of   from Domestic Violence Act, following a confidential report submitted by the women and child development department confirming allegations.
 
 The petition was moved before the court by Sachin Holkar and his mother   through their counsel KK Kunhare and   on December 22, 2016
 
 Sachin Holkar married   on November 22, 2010. After marriage the couple started living at their Annapurna residence with Sachin's mother and elder brother.
 
 The mother-in-law complained Vinita was misbehaving after the marriage. Vinita was accused of not only abusing her husband and her mother-in-law but beating them and refusing to do household chores.
 
 "On September 6, 2016, Sachin fell in the bathroom and suffered a brain hemorrhage, resulting in one side of his body becoming paralysed. As soon as he was admitted to hospital and his treatment began, Vinita started demanding for a new husband since Sachin had become paralysed," Kunhare said. Seeing no hope in her marriage, Vinita fled her husband's home with his valuables and started living with her parents at Marimata area.
 
 Her mother-in-law registered a complaint at the women's police station on November 30, 2016. Getting no positive response, the Holkars filed a complaint before Judge Amodh Arya on December 22, 2016 after which the court ordered the women and child development department to probe the allegations.
