It was in June last year that   announced that he was turning producer with ‘Captain Nawab’. The film is being helmed by ‘Azhar’ director, Tony D’Souza. However, according to latest reports, the ambitious project has got delayed. 

 ‘Captain Nawab’ was to go on floors in December last year and Emraan had even started prepping for it. But the film’s shoot has been reportedly delayed due to the actor’s ‘Baadshaho’ schedule.
 
 Over the last few months, Emraan’s ‘Baadshaho’ co-star   was busy tending to his mother who was keeping unwell. As a result of this, the shoot of ‘Baadshaho’ was pushed and all the actors’ dates were rescheduled. Now, Emraan is shooting for the Milan Luthria-directed movie in Rajasthan. It is only after his ‘Baadshaho’ shoot is complete that Emraan will begin work on his home production in June.
