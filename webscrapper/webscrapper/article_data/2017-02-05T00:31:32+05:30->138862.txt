Indore: Employees of Ruchi Soya, India’s largest manufacture of edible oil based in Indore, staged protest on Saturday against laying off two factory workers and poor labour policies of the company. About 50 workers from the Ruchi Soya unit located at Manglaya raised slogans against the company and displayed placards of their demands. The protest was organsied by Rashtriya Soy Industries Karamchari Sangh. Association president A P Yadav said, “Ruchi Soya has sacked two company workers without any valid reason and claiming that both the workers have resigned which is utterly false.” “We have put our demands to the management but no action has been taken yet” he added. Labour union is alleging that company pays only Rs 240 per day for 12 hours shift to contract workers as against the government fixed rate of Rs 267 per day for 8 hours.  “The said incident was due to few errant employees who had spread malicious information. It is being investigated and resolved in compliance with applicable labor laws" said a spokesperson from Ruchi Soya. Deputy labour commissioner Laxmiprasad Pathak said, “We have received an application from the labour union of Ruchi Soya. We will investigate the matter and try to organize a meeting of the management and labour union soon.”
