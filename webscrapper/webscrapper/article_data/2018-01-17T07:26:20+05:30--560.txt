BHOPAL: A woman was gored by a wild boar when she went out to relieve herself in a village declared open-defecationfree by the   chief minister last year.

 The attack in Sagar’s   panchayat exposes the truth behind ODF tags. The injured woman, Santosh Rani, wasn’t even alone — she was in a group carrying on the usual practice of defecating in the open. Rani was seriously injured and is admitted to Bundelkhand Medical College. She says that despite repeated requests to the panchayat, a toilet was not built at her home, forcing her to go out to relieve herself.
 
 Her son   said, “Everyone in the family goes out and does it in the open because we don’t have a toilet in our house.”
