AHMEDABAD:   on Friday reserved its order till January 31 in two PILs questioning the authorities’ preparedness and action in curbing   in Memnagar area.

 Before reserving its order, a bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice   questioned the decision of authorities to cull and bury birds in Memnagar’s park on December 17 and 18. The high court also asked the government whether it mulls any action with regard to the gesture of NGOs   and Sarva Dharma Raksha Trust. The third question posed before the authorities was about what precaution they have taken to prevent outbreak of the disease in the   and whether they have devised a guideline to be followed.
 
 The bench said that it intends to deal with these issues in its order.
 
 Two PILs were filed by residents of Memnagar area. Bhagwatiben Brahmbhatt, 96, and advocate Kiran Shah. They questioned inaction on part of the civic body and other concerned departments in guarding against the disease, and their decision to bring H5N1-infected birds from Hathijan to Memnagar despite the fact that the prevalence of the disease was suspected much before the birds were transferred to the middle of the city.
