HOWRAH: Four students of city institutions were arrested in Howrah early on Friday for their alleged involvement in a car-and-bike   racket. A brand new Yamaha scooty, which they were allegedly out to sell for Rs 12,000, was also recovered from them. All are residents of adjoining areas of Howrah town.

 The four were remanded in police custody after their production in Howrah court. Police will interrogate them further and suspect they have links to a wider car theft racket in Kolkata. Cops are trying to find out how many vehicles the gang had stolen during the two-odd years they say they have been active.
 
 The four have been identified as Akash Sonar of Hat Lane, Sandip Yadav of Radhamadhab Ghosh Lane, Subham Gupta of G T Road and Suraj Yadav of Bonbehari Bose Road. All four are between 20 and 21 years. Suraj is a second year BCom student of Surendranath College, Subham is in third year BCom at Umesh Chandra College, Sandip in second year BSc at   and Akash is in second year BCom at IGNOU.
 
 Howrah OC Tathagatha Pandey said the four were picked up from their “dealing centre” on Grand Foreshore Road at Ramkrishnapur. “We had been getting complaints of car and bike thefts for some time. We finally tracked them down after being tipped off about their whereabouts,” said Pandey. Sources said a huge number of car keys and fake number plates were also found at their hideout.
 
 Pandey said: “The four confessed during interrogation that they have been stealing cars and two-wheelers parked on the road for two years now. They said after attending college during the day, they would assemble for their theft missions from around midnight till the early hours of the morning. They had duplicate car keys made in Howrah’s Mullick Phatak. The youths would sell the stolen vehicles from their hideout for any figure of choice between Rs 12,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh.”
