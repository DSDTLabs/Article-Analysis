During the Portuguese era, our forefathers migrated to the forested villages of Uttar Kannada district. And even after so many generations, we have maintained our rich cultural bonds through the presentation of folk dances like Tonyamel.”
 
 For almost five days before the full moon day of Phalgun, folk artists walk barefeet to nearby villages in their traditional costumes and perform Tonyamel, whereby folk dancers hold a pair of bamboo sticks in their hands and thump one stick against the other, dancing vigorously while also jumping, squatting and bending their knees to the tunes of folk music created by traditional musical instruments like dhol, taso and kasale.
