No one likes melting   or the one that disappears in less than one hour. If you've invested in a good foundation and still don't get the results, then you're doing it wrong. To get the most of your luxe foundation, follow these easy steps and make sure your make-up lasts longer. From using a brush to dusting powder, read through and get your make-up basics right: 

 
 
 Before you apply anything, make sure you apply a moisturiser. Dry skin can collect the foundation and make your skin look patchy. 
 
 
 Applying a primer will create a smooth base. A good primer will help to hold the foundation and even minimize pores. 
 
 
 Instead of using your hands, use a beauty blender or a brush. These tools will transfer the product to your skin and create a long-lasting finish. 
 
 
 If you've applied liquid foundation, you must dust powder to set the make-up. You can go for translucent powder and make your foundation last all day long!
