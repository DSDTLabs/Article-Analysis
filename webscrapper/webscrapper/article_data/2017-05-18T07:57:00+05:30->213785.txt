NOIDA: Applications for a learner’s licence will be accepted only   via the website of the UP   from June 1, the department has said.

 In an order issued on Wednesday by the ARTO (enforcement), the department said it would only accept applictions filled up online through the website   after submission of the learner’s licence application fee. 
 
 The transport department had started online applications for learner’s licence last year in GB Nagar, along with nine other districts of the state, including Kanpur, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Aligarh, Saharanpur, Allahabad, Agra, Bareilly and Jhansi. The move came after a pilot project was carried out in select districts in 2015.
 
 After the online process was implemented, both the online and offline applications were being accepted at the office.
 
 ARTO (enforcement) S K Singh said the decision was taken since a large number of people turn up seeking learner’s licence forms at the office. 
 
 On the website, applicants can apply for a learner’s licence by filling a form, which requires their names, addresses, vehicles and relevant documents.
 
 After the submission of licence fee online, the applicant will have to go through an online test for obtaining the learner’s licence. The transport department launched the online test and made it mandatory for applicants last year.
