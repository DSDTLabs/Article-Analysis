MUMBAI: Many critics feel that   perhaps doesn't deserve the faith that has been shown in him so far. The 23-year-old's record in ODIs, T20Is and even first class cricket has been first-class cricket has been ordinary. To add to his woes, there is this perception about him that he is flashy and arrogant and gets to be a part of the Indian team purely because he plays for a high-profile IPL franchise - Mumbai Indians.

 However, realising the need to groom a seam-bowling allrounder for the future - particularly when India travel abroad - the men who matter in Indian cricket continue to back Pandya. He's been a part of the India Test squad in recent times, and from Friday, would be captaining India A in a practice match against Australia at the Brabourne Stadium. 
 
 A chat with him indicates that that apart from cricketing talent, Pandya has a wise head on his shoulders too. You need to change your approach according to the situation of the match, and not the format, he feels. “I don't think it is about natural game. If you walk in at 49 for five and play your shots and get out and say that you were playing your natural game, it would be stupid. Cricket is a situation sport, in which you need to play according to the situation. Sometimes in ODIs, you need to play like Test cricket and sometimes in Tests, you need to play like you're in a one-dayer,” he spells out.
 
 This is exactly what batting legend Rahul Dravid told him during the India A series Down Under last year. “One thing which I learnt from Rahul sir in Australia is that cricket is a game about situations.”
 
 Apart from Dravid, skipper   and coach   too seem to have seen something beyond just the numbers in the Baroda cricketer. Acknowledging the support from “Anil sir” and “Virat bhai,” Pandya says. “Your confidence grows when legends like them support you. It helps when you know that your captain is backing you. I am learning a lot of things from them and others.”
