NEW DELHI: The Army today launched a massive combing operation to strengthen counter-infiltration operations in   and Kashmir, because summer is coming, the snows are melting and terrorists are again going to try entering India via the state's many mountain passes, said Army Chief General  .

  "Terrorists are going to attempt infiltration, snows are melting, summer months have started so like each year infiltration will commence. We are taking measures, have beefed up our counter infiltration posture to take care of the situation," said General Rawat.
 
 Part of that operation occurred earlier today when security forces cordoned off almost two dozen villages in   and conducted a huge search operation, in the wake of a surge in terrorist-related incidents in the state in the past few days.
 
 Terror incidents have increased in the last few days.
 
 Suspected terrorists barged into a police post guarding the court complex of southern Shopian late on Wednesday night, and decamped with five service rifles. The terrorists also took away four INSAS rifles and an AK-47. Separately, in  , two banks were robbed on Wednesday in a span of two hours.
 
 "Today's combing operation is to make sure that the situation is brought under control, post the recent incidents," Rawat said.
 
 General Rawat also said the Army had prepared drafts of a military strategic policy and national security strategy. When asked about what response the Army will have to the beheading of two Indian army soldiers, General Rawat said the Army "can't disclose the action plan."
