Salem: Issuing government identity cards with photos of gods and popular actors to the general public is nothing new in the state. In one such latest bizarre case, a city-based youth was issued voter identity card with a girl’s photo. 

 M Ameenudheen, 19, of Anna Nagar in Chinna Tirupathi had applied for the voter identity card on September 23, 2016. He had submitted all the relevant documents, including photographs, to the concerned officials.
 
 Election section officials in the Salem Municipal Corporation (SMC), however, made Ameenudheen run from pillar to post for a year whenever he came enquiring about his voter identity card.
 
 Finally, he came to know that his voter identity card was available at the Salem west taluk office in Suramangalam. When he collected it from the office on Saturday, he was surprised to find the photo of a girl, instead of his. 
 
 “When I took up the issue with the officials, they failed to give me a proper reply,” Ameenudheen said. Upset, he left to the district collectorate to meet the collector, Rohini R Bhajibhakare. The collector, however, was not there and he was directed to meet the election section tahsildar.
 
 The officials at the election section received his complaint and assured him to issue a new identity card with his photo at the earliest.
 
 Ameenudheen said his name was wrongly printed in the Aadhaar card and he was planning to submit the voter identity card as a supportive document to make it correct.
 
  “Now, I can’t produce the voter identity card as the supportive document as it carries the photo of a girl,” he lamented.
