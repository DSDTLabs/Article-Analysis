BENGALURU: Investigation into the   last week has pointed out to the new tactics being employed by criminals — in this case, a vehicle-based   tracker was part of the interceptand-kill strategy.

 
 A six-member gang had murdered 33-year-old Challa alias Challa Kumar on the night of May 17 at Kodathi Gate in southeast Bengaluru. While five persons were arrested, the main accused, Nagaraj, is on the run. Challa, notorious for burglary and theft, was wanted in several cases. As police were on his trail, he had fled Bengaluru and was hiding in Kolar.
 
 Argument led to  
 
 Challa had got into a heated argument with his rival gang member Nagaraj and the latter had allegedly vowed to kill him. Accordingly, the plan for Challa’s murder was hatched after monitoring his movements and daily activities. Police sources said Nagaraj’s gang had succeeded in persuading Challa’s associate Ballary to switch over to their camp and instigated him to kill his boss. They learnt that Challa would often travel in his SUV to Rayasandra near Parappana Agrahara to meet his second wife.
 
 The gang got Ballary to secretly fix a GPS device in Challa’s SUV and started monitoring the latter’s movements on mobile phone. Armed with real-time information, Nagaraj and his gang reportedly intercepted Challa’s SUV near Kodathi Gate and hacked him to death with machetes.
 
 The other gang members involved in the murder are: David John alias David, 29, V Kishore Kumar, 35, Naveen Kumar, 23, Nataraj, 25, and Antony Infant Raj, 23, residents of Banaswadi and surrounding areas, police said.
 
 Though the motive behind the murder is personal rivalry, sources said the use of latest technology by gangsters to spy on their rivals has stumped them.
