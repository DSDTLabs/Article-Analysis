Lucknow: A Lucknow bench of the Allahabad   on Monday sought explanation from the state government and the Lucknow Municipal Corporation asking why meet shops were being forced to shut. It also slammed the civic body for its “lethargy” over the renewal of   to run meet shops.

 Granting three days to the state and the LMC to file their response, the court set the matter for next hearing on April 3.   sellers in Lucknow and several districts have shut their shops for the past three days in protest against the government’s crackdown against illegal   and unlicensed outlets.
 
 A bench of Justice AP Sahi and Justice Sanjai Harkauli passed the order on a pending petition filed in 2015 by Shahabuddin and nine other shopkeepers. The petitioners had pleaded that they were granted licences to run meet shops and when the term of licence expired they applied for renewal.
 
 “But the LMC seemed reluctant to renew the licences on the pretext that as per guidelines of the National green Tribunal, the LMC had no slaughterhouse of its own and as such the licences could not be renewed,” the petition said. P 3
