MANGALURU: Western range police top brass of   has taken a dim view of attempts by people to misuse social media to foment communal discord in society. 

 The use of Facebook, twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram, V-Chat, Skype and other social media tools to spread messages that upsets the ‘social health’ is leading to a law and order problem and will be viewed very seriously, noted P Harishekaran, Inspector-General of Police (Western Range).
 
 People doing so will be booked under section 153-A of IPC. Section deals with attempt to by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes, attempts to promote, on grounds of religion/race/place of birth/residence, or language/caste or community or any other ground, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different reli­gious, racial, language/regional groups or castes/communi­ties.
 
 Reminding people that the offence will attract an imprisonment of up to three years or fine or both, Harishekaran exhorted people not to use any of the above social media or any other such means to spread lies and falsehood. Police will also invoke section 66(a) of the Information Technology Act against miscreants who use social media for their devious selfish ends; he said adding police accent is on ensuring safety of citizens and maintaining law and order.
 
 Backing the order, SP   said police not just in the range, but across the state have decided to tighten the screws on elements misusing social media. Referring to a recent such instance in adjacent Shivamogga, SP said people in their haste to spread communal hatred are willy-nilly are creating irrefutable digital evidence against themselves and lending themselves open to conviction and prison term that goes with the above section of law.
