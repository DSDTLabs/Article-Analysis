JALANDHAR: The Supreme Court’s ruling that a candidate can’t seek votes in the name of religion, caste, race, community or language, comes at a time when religion and caste have become a cornerstone for political campaigning in Punjab. 

 All three key parties the fray — the Congress, AAP, and Shiromani Akali Dal — have played the caste or religion card at least once during campaigning for the state elections in the past year.
 
 In December 2015, chief minister Parkash Singh Badal-led SAD-BJP state government launched a special scheme to run pilgrimage trains and buses as damage control after being cornered on incidents of the sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib and Behbal Kalan firing on Sikh protesters. On the other hand, in the same month, Punjab Congress president   took a Gutka (a compilation of compositions from the Gurbani) in his hands to take oath in Bathinda rally in December 2015, while taking charge as the party’s state unit chief. 
 
 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo  , to woo the 32% strong SC vote bank of the state, had even issued a separate Dalit manifesto and promised a member of the community as its deputy CM if the party came to power. The party had gone to the extent of printing a picture of the Golden Temple on its youth manifesto.
 
 However, a controversy had erupted over the party printing a photo of its symbol, the broom, next to that of the Golden Temple, and Kejriwal had to visit the Golden Temple for the penance. 
 
 Most recently, after beautifying the surroundings of the Golden Temple, the SAD-BJP government had announced to beautify Durgiana temple at a cost of Rs 115 crore. The state government also built a grand temple in the name of sage Valmiki at Ram Tirath in Amritsar. Work is stoll on for building the Begumpura memorial at Khuralgarh village in the memory of Guru Ravidass.
