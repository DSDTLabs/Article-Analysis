Chandigarh: Recently, the UT education department has sent a letter to schools asking them to follow the CBSE circular to ensure the presence of at least one   educator in schools. This comes at a time when the government schools itself lack an adequate number of special educators.

 TOI has reported in the past that in Chandigarh there are around 4,418 students with special needs in the academic session 2017-18. There are only 26 special educators for these kids, which imply the presence of one educator for every 169 students. Even for regular students, the pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) has been fixed with maximum one teacher for every 45 students.
 
 There are 3,332 students in Classes I-VIII under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and 1,086 students in Classes IX-XII under Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA).
 
 In January 2018, TOI had reported that a recent survey by Panjab University had also highlighted how children with disabilities were suffering in government schools. The survey had mentioned there is a shortage of resource staff in the government schools to handle the children with special needs.
 
 The CBSE has made it mandatory for every affiliated school to have a minimum of one special educator. The last circular in this regard was issued on June 13, 2017. CBSE had been asking schools to implement the same since 2015. The education department has attached this information along with the letter sent to private schools.
 
 The CBSE officials have stated that a special educator is specifically required in schools to work with children and young adults who require additional support in order to complete their learning successfully.
