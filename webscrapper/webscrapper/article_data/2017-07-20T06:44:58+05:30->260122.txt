CHARMINAR: Indian pilgrims visiting   for   2017 have been advised to take preventive measures against infectious respiratory diseases as swine flu began quite early this year.

 A large number of Hajis returning from Mecca and Medina complain of what has been medically known as `Haj cough'. The early start of swine flu is likely to increase the threat of Haj cough. Doctors have classified   as any cough which pilgrims returning from Haj experience during and immediately after the Islamic pil grimage. With two million-plus pilgrims gathering at one place, the risk of infection by airborne bacteria increases several times. A recent study on Haj cough by a team of Indian resear chers from the National Institute of Virology, Pune and   reveals that cough was the most common respiratory infection symptoms among Hajis examined on arrival in India.
