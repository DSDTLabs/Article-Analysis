Vadodara: In a first, as a preventive measure, the cops of Chhota Udepur district will undergo screening for oral cancer during a special drive later during the month. The drive will be conducted by Waghodia-based Muni Seva Ashram’s Kailash Cancer Hospital.

 The drive has been held by the hospital as an extension program of World Cancer Day. “Around 70-80% of cancer cases occur due to smoking and chewing tobacco and in Gujarat 30-40% of the population has tobacco addiction. If we screen more than 2,000 policemen we might be able to detect the cases at pre-cancer level,” said Dr Rajesh Kantharia, onco surgeon at the hospital.
 
 Kantharia added that most of the cancer cases that come are at advanced stages, but through the screening drive symptoms of pre-cancer level can be known and the preventive measures can be started before the case worsens.
 
 The hospital is currently also holding a mammography and breast cancer test camp and the Chhota Udepur police is helping to make the camp a success, said Kantharia. “Breast cancer is one of the major types of cancer among women, the cops from Chhota Udepur police are encouraging their wives and other women to participate in it,” Kantharia added.
 
 The hospital will also give concession in treatment to the policemen who will be detected with symptoms of pre-cancer or cancer.
 
 Deputy superintendent of police, Chhota Udepur, Haresh Mewada told TOI: “We are planning to make this camp a success, therefore we have also encouraged home guards personnel, civil defence personnel and traffic brigade personnel to participate in the camp.”
