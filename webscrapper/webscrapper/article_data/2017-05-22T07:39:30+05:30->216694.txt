KOCHI: The schools under   (Council for Indian School Certificate Examination) in the state are taking additional steps to ensure that the students who learn Malayalam until Class XII are able to acquire refined communication skills in the language. In April, the state government had passed an ordinance making Malayalam compulsory for all schools, including government, aided, unaided, self-financing institutions and those affiliated with   and ICSE boards. 

 "As per the CISCE council rules, we have to follow the education guidelines of the state," said Fr George Mathew, general secretary of the Kerala ICSE  , who is also the CISCE council member.
 
 Currently in CISCE schools have two language subjects for grade IX and X (ICSE) and one, English, for Classes XI and XII (ISC). Malayalam is a compulsory subject for all students till Class VIII. He said that Malayalam will not be a part of pass criteria for Class X and XII.
 
 During the management association's meeting with the council chairman, it was highlighted that a similar situation to teach the local language existed in Maharashtra, Gujarat and  . "We were asked to prepare a curriculum and teach the language as an additional subject, with around eight periods for Malayalam a month. The association has decided to select a common textbook, which will be a collection of stories. And we are also planning on having a common examination on the subject across all CISCE schools in the state," said Fr George Mathew. 
 
  "We have added Malayalam to Class XI and XII because as of now there is only one language subject for these grades, one additional language and that too the local language will be beneficial for the students," he added. 
 
 A simple syllabus will be followed to help students who are unfamiliar with the language develop communication skills.
 
 "Such students will be provided with special attention and also will have separate examination paper," said Mathew.
