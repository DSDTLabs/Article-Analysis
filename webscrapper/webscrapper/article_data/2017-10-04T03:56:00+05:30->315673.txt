Panaji: Cracking the whip on illegal structures built in Colvale comunidade land, revenue minister Rohan Khaunte on Tuesday said that the government was in the process of taking action against those who took money in exchange for giving away plots and regularizing illegal encroachments, and constructions in comunidade land. “Show cause and demolition notices have been sent. We have written to TCP to take action for the illegal road access,” Khaunte said while speaking to reporters after a public event. Khaunte said that the revenue department had also issued show cause notices to committees that oversee the functioning of comunidades and would soon take action against them. “If they are unable to justify for the illegalities that have been carried out, then action will be taken as per the law,” he said. The minister accepted that administrative lapses and corruption had allowed comunidade land to be misused and sold illegally.  A government-appointed Comunidade Commission, which was formed after a petition in high court of Bombay at Goa sought an assessment of the status of the comunidade institutions, submitted a 210-page report in which certain recommendations have been made. “We are taking steps and also referring to the comunidade commission report. We are studying it and once we discuss the report we shall see what action has to be taken. It has to be in tune with the high court order,” Khaunte said.  The government has also asked administrators of comunidades to ensure that comunidade bodies are elected as soon as possible. “There are 48 comunidades in South Goa that have no elected bodies,” Khaunte said.
