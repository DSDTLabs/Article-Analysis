 KOCHI: Murder of Youth Congress worker Shuhaib in   drew flak from delegates during the discussion on the organizational report presented by   state secretary   at the CPM state conference on Friday. Sources said at least five delegates who took part in the debate from other districts criticized the Kannur district leadership for its failure to stop political violence.
 
 Delegates pointed out how the untimely murder took away the sheen of the pro-people initiatives of the LDF government and how it helped to rejuvenate the Congress.
 
 Portfolios handled by CPI ministers like revenue, civil supplies and agriculture were at the centre of criticism when delegates reviewed the performance of the state government.
