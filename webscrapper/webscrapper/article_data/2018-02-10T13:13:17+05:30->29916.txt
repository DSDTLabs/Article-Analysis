KOCHI: Despite the presence of swanky shopping malls and plethora of brand outlets in every nook and corner of the city, a crafts bazaar organized by Kairali, the marketing wing of the   of Kerala at   ground, has managed to woo Kochiites. The first day of the expo saw people making a beeline to catch a glimpse of the products displayed.

 
 The iconic Aranmula kannadi, and the ethnic Nettoor petti, an ornamental box made of red sandalwood, were a huge hit among the visitors.
 
 “It has an elusive charm altogether,” said Anjana N, who couldn’t stop looking at her face in the metal mirror.
 
 The prices of the mirrors range from Rs 3,200 to Rs 40, 000, said an official with Kairali.
 
 Nettoor jewel box also known as the Nettoor petti too had many takers. Raja Lakshmi, a 55-year-old woman was one among them.
 
 “While I was young, I always longed for a Nettoor petti. Since my family couldn’t afford to buy the original one at that time I got a replica. It is expensive even today but I am buying this so that I can give it to my daughter,” said Lakshmi.
 
 For   Shetty, a transgender activist and entrepreneur, the opportunity to participate in the handicrafts exhibition was a dream-come-true.
 
 “This is the first exhibition after I got the artisan ID card and mudra loan. Now I have an identity as an entrepreneur,” said Tripthy whose handmade necklaces and gel candles were a huge hit among the crowds.
