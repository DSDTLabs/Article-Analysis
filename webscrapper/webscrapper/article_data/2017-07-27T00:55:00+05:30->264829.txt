Panaji: Construction work on the new   bridge is on at a steady pace, with pillars for the elevated approach roads to the bridge on the Cortalim side already taking shape. 

 A temporary steel walkway of 2m width has been constructed 500m on either side of the river. These temporary walkways are being used for the work of constructing the foundation of two pylons (large pillars). The pylons, which will be constructed on either sides of the river, will support the bridge. 
 
 Fabricated piling gantries will be erected over the temporary platforms and piling will be carried out with these piling gantries and a piling rig in the river, sources said.
 
 The new eight-lane bridge across Zuari river as well as the approaches on both sides are being constructed by Bhopal-based Dilip Buildcon Ltd. in a joint venture with Ukrainian company Mostobudivelnyi Zahin Limited. The Ukrainian companyâ€™s involvement in the project will be to the extent of 26%, providing support in design, technical matters and execution, officials said.
 
 The bridge along with the approaches covers an over 13km stretch, with the elevated approach starting from near the Bambolim cross on the North Goa side and ending near the Verna industrial estate in South Goa. The elevated approaches along with the new Zuari bridge will offer a kind of expressway, shortening the travel time from North Goa to South Goa.
 
 The eight-lanes of the new cable-stayed Zuari bridge will be divided into two carriages of four lanes each. The bridge will taper into the six-lanes of the approach roads. 
 
 Dilip Buildcon Ltd has engaged French company Ingerop, which in association with Infinite Civil Solutions Pvt. Ltd., India, has provided expertise for the bridge design. Ingerop has designed the iconic Severn crossing of UK, sources said.
