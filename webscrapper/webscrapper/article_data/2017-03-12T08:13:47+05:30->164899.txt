JALANDHAR: The Punjab assembly elections saw no independent candidate win this time. The only independent contender who had chance of winning this time was Rajdeep Kaur, sister of gangster-turned-politician Jaswinder Singh Rocky from Fazilka, who finished third but with a margin of just 1,141 votes from winning candidate Davinder Singh Ghubaya of Fazilka. 

 In 2012, there were three independent candidates - Bains brothers Balwinder Singh and Simarjeet Singh and Rajnish Kumar Babbi from Mukerian, who was a Congress rebel. Later, Babbi joined the Congress and this time he was party candidate and won again. This time Bains brother registered their own party, Lok Insaaf Party and also won. 
 
 In 2012, Rocky lost by a slender margin to   candidate from Fazilka. In 2007, there were five independent candidates. Sangat Singh Giljian won from Tanda while Charanjit Channi won from Chamkaur Sahib. Both later joined the Congress. There were three rebel candidates in 2007, who also won. They were Madan Lal from Ghanaur, who contested as an independent after being denied ticket by the party and this time has won as party candidate, Iqbal Singh Jhunda was SAD rebel from Dhuri and Ajit Singh was Congress rebel from Nihal Singh Wala.
 
 However, this time contest was already three-cornered across the state and some potential independent candidates or rebels joined AAP. "This time the anti-incumbency wave was strong and people didn't want to take chances with their votes and preferred big parties," said a political observer.
