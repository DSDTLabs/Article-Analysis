MAPUSA: Bardez, which gave BJP an edge to establish absolute majority in 2012, has fallen away from the party this time, with the saffronites not able to maintain their hold over the taluka. With a hung assembly and having to deal with Goa Forward Party (GFP), and an independent MLA in the taluka, Bardez could also be one of the deciding factors in the formation of the government.

 In 2012, six of seven seats in Bardez were wrested by BJP, while one seat went to an independent candidate. In 2017, BJP could only get three seats. The taluka saw heavyweight ministers like Dayanand Mandrekar and Dilip Parulekar bite the dust. 
 
 GFP won two seats in this taluka and both were at the cost of BJP ministers. Congress has made a comeback in the taluka as former NCP MLA and now Congress candidate Nilkanth Halarnkar defeated BJP's Kiran Kandolkar in Tivim constituency.
 
 BJP’s only senior leader who has won is Francis D'Souza in Mapusa with a margin of over 6,000 votes. If the BJP sits on the opposition benches, D'Souza will be the seniormost leader of the BJP. Michael Lobo winning in Calangute and Glen Ticlo, winning in Aldona, made it for the BJP, giving some respite to the party.
 
 If BJP had to come to power with an absolute majority, the taluka was expected to be a powerhouse as second-time winners Ticlo and Lobo were expected to get ministries and BJP’s three cabinet ministers from Bardez, D’Souza, Parulekar and Mandrekar, were likely to continue as ministers. BJP leaders had predicted that the party would win six of seven seats in the taluka.
