CHENNAI: Annoyed over the blame game of the two factions of the  , blaming each other for the death of former chief minister J  , a grass-root cadre of the party's   district has approached the Madras high court seeking direction to the state to order a judicial inquiry to probe the cause of death. 

 The petitioner P Muruganandham from   taluk of Thiruvarur district also wanted the court to pass an interim injunction against the cabinet ministers of the state including 'Dindigul' C Srinivasan and 'Vellamandi' N Natarajan from commenting/ making statements on the causes of death of Jayalalithaa till the probe is ordered. He submitted that constitution of a committee headed by a retired high court judge to probe the cause of former chief minister's death was a long standing demand of the people of Tamil Nadu, particularly of loyal cadres of AIADMK. 
 
 The government on August 17, announced that a judicial probe would be ordered soon. But as there was no positive developments even after several weeks, I made a representation to the chief secretary to take immediate steps to order the probe. As the authorities failed to respond to my representation, I have approached the high court, he said.
 
 The petitioner added that when the chief minister has already announced appointment of a judicial enquiry, the statements of cabinet ministers accusing the rival group as reason for her death creates great suspicion among general public.
