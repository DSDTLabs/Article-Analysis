We had earlier reported that   and director   are coming together for a Tamil comedy film, which is being bankrolled by Gnanavel Raja of Studio Green. While the project is expected to take off from July, some interesting news has cropped up.

 As speculated earlier, the makers have roped in actress   to play the female lead. Interestingly, the yet-untitled film marks Sivakarthikeyan’s second association with Nayanthara after their ‘Velaikkaran’, which was very successful at the box office.
 
 Touted to be an out-and-out comedy, the project went on the floors recently after a formal pooja ceremony that took place in Chennai. If reports are anything to go by, the film is expected to release by the end of this year.
 
 On the work front, Sivakarthikeyan and Nayanthara are busy with their respective work commitments. The latter recently joined the sets of Thala Ajith Kumar’s ‘Viswasam’ in Hyderabad. She also has films like ‘Imaikka Nodigal’, ‘Aramm 2’, ‘Kolamaavu Kokila’ and ‘Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy’ in her kitty. Sivakarthikeyan, on the other hand, awaits the release of the rural entertainer ‘Seema Raja’, directed by Ponram.
