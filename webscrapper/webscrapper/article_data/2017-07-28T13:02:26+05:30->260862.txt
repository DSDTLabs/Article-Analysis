Rohtak: The additional sessions judge Narinder Kaur on Thursday stayed proceedings of a lower court in Rohtak in a case pertaining to the “beheading” remark by yoga guru Baba Ramdev during a speech at a ‘Sadbhavna Sammelan’ in 2016. The event was organised to effect peace in Rohtak after the violence during the Jat agitation in February 2016. 

 The counsel for the petitioner argued that the lower court had mentioned certain words uttered by Ramdev were directed at the Muslim community by wrongly assessing facts. He stated none from the Muslim community ever raised any complaint against the petitioner.
 
 After hearing the arguments, the additional sessions judge stayed the proceedings of the lower court and issued a notice to the respondents for September 12. Earlier, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM)   had issued a non-bailable warrant against Ramdev in June. 
 
 Ramdev had been summoned by the court under sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke the breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC after former   minister Subhash Batra of the Congress got a case registered against him.
