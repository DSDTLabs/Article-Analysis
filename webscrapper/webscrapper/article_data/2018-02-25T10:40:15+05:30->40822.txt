GUWAHATI:   has demanded an apology from Congress leader and MP Shashi Tharoor for having allegedly compared National People's Party (NPP) to the tail of a dog during his media conference in Shillong on Friday, saying the language used by the parliamentarian is not only shocking, but also condemnable and insulting. 

 BJP in-charge for Meghalaya, Nalin   claimed in a press conference in Shillong on Saturday that Tharoor's remark also implies that the saffron party has been equated with a dog, which is an insult to the voters. "Such language as used by Tharoor is unacceptable. He has insulted the voters who have voted   to power in many states of the country. He has also insulted the voters of Meghalaya by using such condemnable language. Tharoor, as well as the Congress party, should immediately tender an apology for using such low language," Kohli said. 
 
 The saffron party further claimed that Congress is indulging in communal politics to gloss over its failures in governance which are being increasingly being exposed. Thus, BJP, which has often been accused of propagating the Hindutva ideology, has now turned the tables on Congress by accusing them of communal polarization in Meghalaya and dividing people into Christians and non-Christians. "Congress in Meghalaya has resorted to its age-old tactic of communal polarization. We are following a positive agenda of development and at the same time exposing the corruption and malpractices prevalent under Congress rule," Kohli said.
 
 He also claimed that the   manifesto, released just four days ahead of polling in the state, has shown that the ruling party is being haunted by the 'unfulfilled promises' it had made to the people. Kohli also congratulated commandos of the Meghalaya Police for killing the outlawed GNLA chief   in an encounter on Saturday, adding that police can accomplish its tasks effectively when there is no political interference.
