Two days to go for Holi, and it's already raining colours in Hyderabad. On Sunday, Kishan   threw a pre-Holi bash for his friends and family and what followed was unabashed revelry and merry-making. Given that there was a dress code to wear white, the guests sportingly arrived wearing the choicest of white clothes, of different patterns and designs. The attractions of this do were a huge inflated pool, a chocolate pool, foot tapping music by an International DJ flown in from Mumbai for the gig. The guests daubed each other in powdered herbal colours that were brought from  , splashed in pools and got into an impromptu jig in merriment. And what's a   party without good food? The guests were treated to various vegetarian delicacies that kept them well fed and charged up for the festivities that went on till six in the evening.
