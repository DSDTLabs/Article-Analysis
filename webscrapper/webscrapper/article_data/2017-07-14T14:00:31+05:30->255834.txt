LUCKNOW: Top dispensation in Uttar Pradesh remains on their toes as 60 gm of what seems like high-intensity explosive material had been found inside Vidhan Sabha building during session. 

 The packet containing white powder was traced by anti-sabotage team on July 12 during routine checking day after budget was tabled in the house.
  
 The team handed over the suspicious packet to marshal and left the house thereafter. "It is a routine exercise to check the house during assembly sessions and whatever anomalies are detected are shared by security staffers deployed at Vidhan Sabha," said SSP Lucknow Deepak Kumar. 
 
 The matter was sounded out to higher ups and on Wednesday the packet was sent to Mahanagar based forensic laboratory by SHO of Hazratganj police station. The laboratory experts on Thursday told police that the substance seems like PETN, one of the most powerful plastic explosives. 
 
 "The laboratory though was yet to submit a written report in this regard," said Kumar who added that chemical examination is yet to take place and findings are based upon preliminary tests.
 
 Nonetheless, DGP and senior police officers briefed chief minister about the matter subsequently and were scanning the CCTV footage to find out who was behind the act. 
 
 The explosive can only be triggered with IED or detonator and cannot be used standalone.
