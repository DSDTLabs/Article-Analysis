AJMER: Uncertainty prevails over the upcoming visit of Pakistani delegation for the yearly   of   starting from March 19.

 According to officials, the important day, Rajab sixth, will fall on March 24 and Urs will conclude on March 27 with ' '. Thereafter, the shrine will be washed with rose water. Traders and artisans are hoping for a 'bonanza' this time as last two years witnessed lesser crowds due to demonetization. The main attraction of Urs are 'kalandars' who perform games to attract devotees. They have already 'walked' to   from Meharoli of New Delhi. Another attraction would be transgenders who come from different parts of the country. They are devotees of Khwaja and hold their panchayat at the time of Urs.
