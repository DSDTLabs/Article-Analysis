PUNE: Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP)   MP   Bhosale, who is a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, is likely to join the Bharatiya Janata Party ( ).

 Political observers say that the BJP is trying to strengthen its base in the majority Maratha community that is agitating for reservation. Traditionally, Sharad Pawar has dominated the Maratha vote bank and now BJP is breaching his bastion.
 
 Bhosale is seeking political support from the BJP government after the Satara court recently rejected his anticipatory bail in an extortion case. He has been accused of allegedly threatening, attacking and demanding money from a Lonand-based businessman. 
 
 Senior BJP leader and minister in the state cabinet Chandrakant Patil has already shown a green signal to Bhosale. Patil recently said that BJP would welcome him into the party. 
 
 While Bhosale has preferred to keep mum on the developments, his supporters claim that the MP might announce his decision in a couple of weeks.
 
 Interestingly, Pawar, who is on a Satara tour, discussed Bhosale’s move with NCP leaders in Satara district and asked them to be ready with a counter strategy.
