MUMBAI: All doubts over the authenticity of Olive ridley hatchings at   were laid to rest on Friday. Forest officials visited the beach and confirmed the development.

 Additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell) N Vasudevan said his officials saw nesting sites, egg shells and a few unhatched eggs. “This is a shot in the arm for those engaged in cleaning   beach. We appeal to citizens not to disturb the nesting. In case anyone comes across newly hatched  , inform the mangrove cell officials,” he said.
 
 
  
 
 “It seems a single female turtle came to the beach and laid several eggs, of which over 80 hatched successfully,” he added.
 
 
  
 
 However, some citizens did not approve of the forest officials move as they felt the digging and photography “disturbed” the nesting sites. 
 
 
  
 
 Vasudevan said, “The main hatchings took place on Thursday and what remained were shells and eggs which could not hatch. This is a natural phenomenon, not all eggs hatch. We had to look for proof as some citizens had raised doubts.”
 
 
  
 
 Naturalist and author Sunjoy Monga, who was among those who had questioned the hatchings, said, “Now that egg shells have been found, it seems to be genuine. The nests were close to a methi plantation.”
 
 Environmentalist D Stalin, who had also written to the forest department to raise his suspicion, said: “I am glad they confirmed that it is authentic.”
