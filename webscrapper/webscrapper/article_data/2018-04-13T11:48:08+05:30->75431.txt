VIJAYAWADA:   (TTD) will be the first ever temple management in the country to use Virtual   ID of devotees for identity authentication when they come for VIP or slot-based darshan. A system will soon be introduced in a phase-wise manner.

 “Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is working on our platforms so we can use this new service launched by   ( ) in some days,” Anil Kumar Singhal , TTD executive officer, said.
 
 However, devotees can still use their Aadhaar cards. Having only Virtual ID from UIDAI is not compulsory.
 
 Virtual IDs can be created by users who already have Aadhaar cards by logging into UIDAI website and providing details or by downloading M Aadhaar application. They can even approach Aadhaar enrollment centers for creating Virtual ID. “Virtual ID is like duplicate Adhaar.”
 
 Virtual ID will be a 16-digit number mapped to Aadhaar number. Once citizens generate a Virtual ID, they can provide that number for authentication. If a devotee provides Virtual ID to TTD, they will enter it into the system and receive a token that authenticates it, and provides a limited set of demographic details such as name, phone number and address. Unlike in the past, TTD will now be able to authenticate devotees without actually knowing the Aadhaar number.
