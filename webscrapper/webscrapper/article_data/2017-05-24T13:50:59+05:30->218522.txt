CHENNAI: Fishing will resume in Chennai,   and   districts on May 29 after a 45-day ban, the   government has announced. However, the   will continue till June 14 in other coastal districts of the state.

 In 2013, the central government constituted a technical committee to carry out studies to suggest reforms to be introduced in imposing uniform fishing ban in the country. The committee recommended that fishing ban can be imposed on the east coast from April 15 to June 14 and from June 1 to July 31 on the West Coast. While other states have followed the 61-day ban since 2015, Tamil Nadu introduced it this year only. 
 
 According to the Tamil Nadu government order, a stakeholder meeting was held in April where fishermen association representatives from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts said fishers were severely affected by cyclone Vardah and the oil spill on the coastline.
 
 The representatives suggested that the 45-day fishing ban period be followed in the three districts this year too and be increased to 61 days from the next year onwards. The government accepted the suggestion and so the ban would come to an end in three districts on May 29 while it would continue for 61 days in other coastal districts.
