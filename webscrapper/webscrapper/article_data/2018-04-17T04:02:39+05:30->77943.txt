NEW DELHI: BJP said on Monday that the acquittal of five accused in the   blast case, including saffron activist  , has exposed Congress’s “politics of appeasement” and its defamation of Hindus through false narratives about “saffron terror” to serve political goals. 

 BJP said the accused had been framed to create a false equivalence of “Hindu terror” and was part of Congress’s political project to tar the majority community. BJP spokesman   alleged Congress has long “defamed” Hindus for votes and demanded that   and his predecessor   apologise for terms such as “saffron terror” and “Hindu terror”. 
 
 The verdict provided ammunition to BJP coming as it does ahead of the Karnataka polls and attacks on the party for giving a communal colour to the Kathua rape-murder. Taking a dig at Rahul, Patra wondered if he (Rahul) would lead a candle march to India Gate and apologise for his attempts to “defame” Hindus as he had done to protest against the Kathua and Unnao crimes. 
 
 Patra said people will teach Congress a resounding lesson in the Karnataka assembly polls as they had in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Patra brought up comments by Congress leaders, including a Wikileaks cable that reported that Rahul had opined in a chat with US diplomatic staff that radicalised Hindu groups posed a bigger danger to the country that Islamists. 
 
 Former home ministers P Chidambaram, Shivraj Patil and Sushilkumar Shinde had also spoken about “saffron terror”, Patra alleged, adding that Karnataka CM   was a practitioner of appeasement politics to garner Muslim votes.
