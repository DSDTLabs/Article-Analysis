TV actor   is holidaying in London, this time without his actress wife  .
 
  He has been in the beautiful city for quite some time now and has constantly been sharing pictures of all that he has been doing there on Instagram.
  
  
 
  
  His latest pictures just look amazing and we couldn't help reading the caption twice. He captioned the pictures, "Day 34 on #BiggBossTamil lacked the usual hyped-drama as the housemates largely kept to themselves."
  
  
  
    posted another picture of himself standing at a railway station platform with his luggage and he captioned the picture, "Tonight's gonna be a good night, looking forward to partying at ‚Ä™Wembley - HA9 6LL ... #LONDON üòçüòç see you !"
  
  
  
  Ankita Bhargava was also on a Europe trip recently along with her mom and dad. She had also posted a lot of pictures earlier.
  
  Karan, who plays Raman Bhalla on Yeh Hai Mohabbatein opposite TV's favourite face Divyanka Tripathi won the Best Actor award for the 4th consecutive year recently.
  
  Karan, who was handed over his award by wife Ankita Bhargava on stage, took to Instagram to reveal about the only woman (the trophy) whose entrance inside his house makes his wife and family members happy.
