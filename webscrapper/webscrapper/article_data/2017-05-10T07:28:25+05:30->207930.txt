 Police have booked BJP scheduled caste cell leader Sheetal Angural and Pardeep Khullar and their associates who are known for their loyalty to Sampla. They staged a dharna blocking the road a few days back, demanding that a case should be registered against the girl while terming her a “blackmailer.” They have been booked under sections 341 and 149 of the IPC for illegally restraint and unlawful assembly.
 
 Meanwhile, a special investigation team (SIT) led by additonal deputy commissioner of police-II (ADCP-II) D Sudarvizhi questioned Ashu and the complainant in front of each other. Police had preferred to first probe the girl’s complaint and formed an SIT instead of directly registering a case against Ashu and his other kin named in the complaint.
