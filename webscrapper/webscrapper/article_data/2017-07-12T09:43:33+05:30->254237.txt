BOKARO: The  's (NGT) ban on   from   have added to the woes of   (BSL). The company said the growing crisis of sand during monsoon is hampering its ongoing multi-crore rupees  . 

 Sand lifting from the riverbeds in the district is banned during the rainy season - between June 10 and October 15 - following the direction of the NGT. It has created a shortage of sand for the industries as only those having licensed stock of sand are supplying it with proper royalty papers. The district mining department said licensed sand stock is very limited and is almost consumed.
 
 The management of the BSL has approached the state and central governments seeking help on regularised supply of sand after the modernisation project worth Rs 6,500 crore delayed due to several factors including shotages of sand supply.
 
 "The BSL aimed to complete its modernisation project by March 2018. But it it now concerned over sand crisis as it would cause more delay to these projects, causing huge financial loss. The BSL needs a huge amount of sand for civil and other under-construction work inside the plant. We are requesting the government to get its supply," BSL CEO P K Singh said.
 
 On the other hand, district mining officer Gopal Kumar Das said they are keeping strict vigil on sand transportion. 
 
 "It is not only the NGT which has directed to stop sand lifting, but the mining act also prohibits sand lifting from riverbeds during rainy season. Till October 15 sand lifting is banned and those found involved in this unethical practice will have to face legal action. We will conduct raids to ensure sand is not being lifted from riverbeds."
