They grew up in the same locality and even visited the same gym. However, it took a Bollywood film for Delhi neighbours   and   to meet each other. In fact, the two, who are currently shooting for Neeraj Pandey’s espionage thriller in the Capital, were surprised that they never bumped into each other before.

 The Delhi connection helped them break the ice rather easily. Rakul says, “While talking, we realised that both of us grew up in Defence Colony; Sidharth’s house is in the lane behind mine. We studied in Delhi University (South Campus) and even went to the same gym. That’s not all; we even had the same trainer! It was surprising that we had never seen each other before. In a way, it helped us bond — we spoke about our favourite food joints and enjoyed the schedule in Delhi as that allowed us to meet our friends and family.”
