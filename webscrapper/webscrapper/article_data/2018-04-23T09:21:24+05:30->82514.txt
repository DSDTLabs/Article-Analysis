 Data collected by automatic weather stations of TSDPS since 2010 shows that areas such as Monda Market and   have   up to 47.6°C in 2015. The mercury level in urban pockets of the city such as Jubilee Hills, West Maredpally, Narayanaguda, Madhapur have also touched 44-45°C over the last three years.
 
 “The maximum temperature in areas which have increased commercial activity, such as construction work, or declined lung space is always two to three degrees higher than other areas,” said YV  , consultant meteorologist of TSDPS. Experts also attribute the rise in temperature to increased glass facades and unplanned urbanisation.
