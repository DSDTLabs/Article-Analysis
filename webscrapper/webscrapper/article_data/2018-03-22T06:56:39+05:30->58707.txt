NEW DELHI: Saying that the   believed in “a sacred contract” between the government and the citizens, Delhi deputy chief minister   presented the   for 2017-18 in the   on Wednesday. The exercise covered 34 government departments and agencies, most of which were assessed to have performed adequately. Their performance in the fiscal year was deemed to be “on-track” if they had achieved 70% of their targets up to December 31, 2017.

 The departmental performances were benchmarked against a cumulative 1,900 unique measurable indicators. Claiming Delhi was the first government “anywhere in India to carry out such a rigorous exercise of outcome budgeting”, Sisodia said the aim was to usher in accountability in government expenditure and to “communicate to the members of this House a detailed status of achievements up to December 2017 against the Outcome Budget 2017-18, before proposing next year’s budget”.
  
  
 
 
 
 In 2017-18, the number of Delhi Transport Corporation buses decreased from 4,126 the previous fiscal to 3,988, but the fleet strength in the cluster scheme went up from 1,700 to 1,757. Despite the numbers, cumulative ridership saw a hike, mainly because of the cluster buses carrying more people. Sisodia seemed to believe that the Delhi Metro fare hike last year had led to more people using buses.
 
 The deputy CM said it was justified in protesting the Delhi Metro fare hike, pointing out the urban rail network’s load, which, after a daily average ridership of 28 lakh in 2016-17, was expected to go up to 30 lakh this year, had dipped to 27.5 lakh instead.
 
 The transport department was on track in 60% of the 89 critical indicators, and it was able to construct seven new bus depots against the target of 11.
 
 
 
 
 The three directorates related to education, higher education, and training and technical education all completed more than 70% of their planned projects by December 2017. The Outcome Budget recorded the directorate of training and technical education as having the maximum projects “on track” at 89%.
 
 The directorate of education’s met 74% of the targets, among them EWS admissions, teacher training and infrastructure development. The Outcome Budget claimed that 24,500 students from EWS/DG category were admitted to private schools during the year. The government successfully started nursery classes in school, filling 60% of the seats against a targeted 80%. “Some people don’t know about the nursery classes yet and this could explain the shortfall,” Sisodia said.
 
 Of the projects under the directorate of higher education, 71% were on track, though 10% were below expectations. This year, 411 research papers were published till December in all colleges, just short of last fiscal’s 524.
 
 
 
 
 On 643 indicators in health, 76% of the government’s projects were on track. Among those still on the slow burner was the construction of mohalla clinics. The government could add only 59 clinics of the planned 1,000 during the fiscal. Around 32 lakh patients visited the 159 clinics during the year. Another area where the government lagged was in completing hospital projects. Except for the Indira Gandhi Hospital and a project in Burari, where the number of beds increased from 700 to 1241 and from 200 to 800, respectively, there was no forward movement elsewhere.
 
 The special immunisation programme was, however, more successful, and 56% coverage was achieved against a target of 75%. Claiming that it was a new scheme, the Outcome Budget offered no data on the number of beneficiaries for laboratory diagnostics under the public-private partnership scheme, but the model proved efficacious in adding dialysis machines into the system. Against a target of 75 machines till December, 60 were installed and 2,822 patients availed their services.
 
 
 Delhi Jal Board was on track in a majority of its 20 projects and lagged only in 16% of the indicators up to December 31. In a major achievement, DJB saved over 4 million gallons per day of water by plugging the leaks in ageing and damaged pipes. “2,064 km of defective pipelines were replaced against 1,912 km in 2016-17,” Sisodia said. An additional supply of 8 MGD of water was created during the year by developing and reviving 81 tubewells and Ranney wells.
 
 Delhi government disbursed Rs 31 crore every month as subsidy to 4.5 lakh consumers who used less than 20,000 litres. It also got 65 unauthorised colonies connected to the drinking water network, thus expanding the pipeline length to 3,923 km. In addition, 265 unauthorised colonies were connected with the sewerage network, up from 241 in 2016-17 with 1,738 km of new sewer lines laid up to December.
 
 
 
 
 In 64 key indicators for environment department, 48 were assessed as being on track. However, it fell short on the major target of operationalising 20 air quality monitoring stations, being able to put up only 16 during the fiscal.
 
 The forest sector also fared well with the total forest and tree cover in the capital going up to 305 sq km from 299 sq km last fiscal, 5 sq km beyond the targeted 300 sq km. Both the planned butterfly parks were successfully opened, though in terms of attracting visitors to wildlife sanctuaries, the department could bring in only 8,000 people against the expected 12,000.
 
 Sisodia also said that Rs 27 crore was collected under the air ambience fund though no specific target had been set.
 
 
 
 The social welfare department fared well with 80% of its projects on track. However, while the construction of five halfway/long-stay homes was completed, only three became operational. The Outcome Budget also showed overcrowding in homes for mentally challenged people, with the six homes with room for 810 inmates actually lodging 1,169. Also, construction work started only on two of the planned 10 old-age homes.
 
 
 
 
 Against a target of 70% completion of the Barapullah Phase III project, only 52% could be achieved and only one foot overbridge of the five targeted could be finished. Accordingly, as many as 25 of the 56 indicators for PWD were deemed to be off track.
