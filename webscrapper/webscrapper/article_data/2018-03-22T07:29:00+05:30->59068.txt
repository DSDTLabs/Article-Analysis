Chandigarh: The Punjab government will table all reports of various commissions set up by it in the Vidhan Sabha. This was announced by chief minister Amarinder Singh while replying to a query raised by the leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira.

 Khaira raised a query during the speech of MLA Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa on the motion of thanks on the governorâ€™s address in the state assembly on the second day of the budget session.
 
 Talking to media persons later, Amarinder said while the Narang Commission report was ready to be presented in the House during the current budget session, the reports of the Justice (Retd) Ranjit Singh Commission and Justice (Retd) Mehtab Singh Commission would be tabled in the assembly once they are finalized. The government had set up the Justice (Retd) Narang Commission to probe illegal sand mining while the Justice (Retd) Ranjit Singh Commission and the Justice (Retd) Mehtab Singh Commission were tasked, respectively, with investigating the sacrilege cases and false cases registered during the SAD-BJP regime.
