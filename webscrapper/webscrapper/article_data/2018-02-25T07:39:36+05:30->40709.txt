NAGPUR: The state government has asked the education department to release payments of school teachers in the offline mode till April as the software called “Shalarth” which enables online processing and disbursing of salaries has developed ‘technical glitches’. Salaries will still be deposited directly in their bank accounts, but the offline mode will just increase paperwork for education department.

 The online   software was being serviced by a major IT company that’s listed on the country’s stock exchange. Dipendra Lokhande, district education officer (primary), said, “We have been working overtime for this and for January, paid in February, the salary will be deposited in teachers accounts within a few days. We have cleared all the bills and the money has been released from the treasury as well.” He added that the IT company’s contract for maintaining software may go to someone else. “The government has given us permission to release salaries in the offline mode till the month of April,” said Lokhande. 
 
 The state government issued a GR recently which mentioned that a   glitch in the software developed around January 12 and that it won’t be possible to resolve the problem soon. Hence taking into account the possible delay in this, the government has decided to release offline salaries till April.
 
 Even last year, teachers faced delay in salary payments around Diwali because of a software issue. From August 2017, it had been made mandatory to deduct annual accident insurance premium from salary. When officials sent the salary bill for processing, it came to everyone's notice the software on screen did not reflect the tab for making the deduction. The annual premium was Rs354, was deducted in one go of 5,000 teachers employed in ZP schools to whom a total of Rs23 crore is disbursed as salary.
