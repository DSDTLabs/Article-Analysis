Bollywood actress 
  was spotted enjoying an evening drive around the city with her little prince   Pataudi. After introducing him to the world within a day of his birth on December 20, the actress stepped out for the very first time with the now three-month-old boy. Accompanied by a nanny, the mother-son duo hit the city for a casual late evening drive. 

 Although Taimur was swaddled in a blanket and nestled carefully on the caretaker’s shoulder, the partial glimpse of his adorable face and button nose was more than enough to get the fans excited. A number of pictures from Taimur’s day out in the city have been doing the rounds on social media through many fan pages. 
 
 
  
 Kareena had mentioned that she was contemplating on taking her son along with her to her upcoming ‘Veerey Di Wedding’ shoot. If she does intend to take the chota nawab along, we can certainly look forward to seeing a number of pictures of this cutie.
