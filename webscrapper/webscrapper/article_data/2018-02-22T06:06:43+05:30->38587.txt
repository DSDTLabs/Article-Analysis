BENGALURU:  , elder son of Shantinagar Congress MLA NA Haris, and his six associates, who have been accused of attacking a youth in a city restaurant last week, were on Wednesday remanded in judicial custody for 14 days. A city civil and sessions court, meanwhile, posted the hearing of the bail petitions by   and other accused to Friday. 

 Earlier in the day, Cubbon Park police produced the seven accused before the VIII ACMM court as the police custody of the accused had come to an end. Md Haris and six others have been accused of brutally thrashing Vidvat L, a resident of  , at a posh hotel in UB City on Saturday night.
 
 Special public prosecutor Shyam Sundar opposed Md Haris's bail plea. "This case is the height of cruelty, something akin to   case," he told the court in oblique reference to the events where the accused, after mercilessly beating the victim, chased him to a private hospital where he had been admitted and threatened him with dire consequences if a police complaint is filed.
 
 
 
 
 Advocates at the sessions court hall requested the police to clear the premises of outsiders, saying supporters of Haris had occupied it and made it difficult for them to go about their job. "These men and women claimed that they are Haris supporters and have come to extend their support to him. We removed them all from the court hall," a senior police officer told TOI.
