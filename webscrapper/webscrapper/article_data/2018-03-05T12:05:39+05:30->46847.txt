JAISALMER: A domestic camel at a hamlet near Bandha village of Jaisalmer district attacked the 14-year old son of its owner and killed him. At the time of the incident no one was there in the house as the family had gone to a nearby hamlet to attend a marriage. In this two-day old incident neither a case was lodged nor was the district administration informed.

 After this incident there was grief in nearby areas. Last year too at   village a camel turned violent and killed its owner. As per the information from villagers at   near Bandha village, Urs Khan aka Ursia resides with his family.
 
 Two days ago he along with his family had gone to attend a marriage in nearby hamlet and his 14-year-old son   was at home. In the afternoon when Maula went to give fodder to camel, it got violent and caught Maula by his waist and started biting him. When Maula screamed the family members rushed to help him but by then the camel had killed him.
 
 Later family members beat the camel and drove it out. Police was not informed and the body was buried. It is to be mentioned that winters are breeding season for camels and camels come into heat on seeing female camels and sometimes become violent and attack their owners. Many such incidents take place in Jaisalmer and Barmer districts and even incidents take place with BSF jawans at Indo-Pak border.
 
 On March 23 last year at Basanpeer, a camel attacked its owner   and sat on him for hours. When Ashok did not turn up the family searched for him and came to know about this incident. Similarly, at Barmer on May 22, 2016 at Mangta village a camel killed its owner. In last six months there were many incidents of camels attacking the BSF jawans and injuring them.
