PANAJI: Goa   unit has stated that the organization will not play an active role in campaigning for   candidates for the February 4 assembly elections. “We will not tell RSS cadre to support any particular party,” RSS sanghchalak for Goa   told TOI.

 In the past, RSS members have actively campaigned for BJP candidates. But Behre stated that the state unit would leave it to its members whether to work for any candidate or not. He also claimed that RSS was never actively involved in politics. But BJP state president Vinay Tendulkar told TOI he had full confidence that RSS cadre would back BJP candidates in the polls.
 
 BJP is already reeling under the revolt engineered by former RSS Goa unit chief Subhash Velingkar, who went on to float a new party  , which is fighting the polls in alliance with   (MGP). Last week, Velingkar had said that RSS cadre in Goa would never vote for the BJP.
 
 Political observers said the majority of RSS cadre still owed allegiance to Velingkar.
