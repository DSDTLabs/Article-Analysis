Kolkata: Bengal chief minister   Banerjee wants the Congress-JD(S) alliance to be allowed to form a government in Karnataka.

  She congratulated JD(S) leader H D Kumaraswamy for good results in the polls. “As a regional party, they have done well. All regional parties are doing well. H D Deve Gowda is a kingmaker. He is a revered figure, he was our PM. As an MP I had approached him,” she said at Nabanna.
 
 The CM, who has proposed a federal front for a one-to-one fight against BJP in the Lok Sabha polls, had earlier called up Deve Gowda. She said: “There is a precedent in Goa and Manipur, where Congress was not called to form the government despite emerging as the single largest party. So it depends on the governor. We are proud of our democracy and should also respect the governor. Let that democratic institution be taken forward. Already, Congress-JD(S) has moved the governor to form the government.”
 
 She tweeted: “Congratulations to the winners...For those who lost, fight back. If Congress had gone into an alliance wi-th JD(S), then the result would have been very different.”
 
 Banerjee said: “BJP has turned to be the largest party, while Congress is the second largest one, so we must show our respect for all. If there had been a pre-poll alliance, then the result would have been far better.... Congress and BJP must remember the imp-ortance of regional parties.”
