BENGALURU: After an impressive start to their   (Group A) campaign, Karnataka lost steam in the middle of the league. Their match against Haryana was abandoned and a four-run loss to Punjab meant the hosts had to beat Railways in their last league outing to seal a knockout berth.

 
 At the Alur stadium on Friday, a young Karnataka side, led by Karun Nair, stuttered but managed to overcome a spirited challenge from Railways. The 16-run win helped them progress to the quarterfinals where the former champions will face Hyderabad in New Delhi on February 21.
 
 Birthday boy   (89, 94b, 15x4) and   (54, 37b, 5x4, 2x6) added some lustre to Karnataka’s misfiring batting order, although it still left Railways needing only a modest 258 to win. However, the pace duo of   (4/35) and   (4/48) — who shared the new ball in the absence of the experienced R Vinay Kumar and Abhimanyu Mithun — ensured Railways folded up for 241 in 47.1 overs. Ronit More (2/49) also chipped in with a strong performance for the hosts.
 
 The new-ball pair got Karnataka off to a rollicking start. Wicketkeeper Sharath gladly accepted an edge from opener Saurabh Wakaskar off the third ball of the innings sent down by Prasidh while the other opener Asadulla Khan (0) was bowled by Pradeep off the first ball of the second over. Both bowlers got the ball to move off the wicket which left Railways reeling at 6/54 at one stage.
 
 It was left to the lower order of the Railways, who had earlier toiled hard in the field, to make a fist of it. Ankit Yadav (51, 64b, 4x4, 1x6) and Anureet Singh (59, 71b, 3x4, 5x6) stitched together a 113-ball 91-run partnership for the seventh wicket to bring Railways right back into the contest. Karnataka’s bowlers did lose some of their sting perhaps because the afternoon sun took the nip out of the wicket.
 
 The middle and lower-order batsmen thrived, connecting fairly well and weighed in with timely boundaries. Ankit and Avinash Yadav’s (40, 39b, 2x4, 2x6) eighth-wicket partnership of 55 runs (47b) put Railways within sniffing distance of victory. They belted 21 runs off the 38th over and did well to keep the asking rate around six-an-over.
