BHOPAL: The   is all set to register an FIR against owners and promoters of six private medical colleges in the state for allegedly "selling" 200 seats of state quota in 2013, sources said. 

 Many of them have already been chargesheeted in the 2012 admission scam. Some, who are out on bail, are being summoned to record their statement. Dr Anand Rai - a whistleblower in the scam - alleged that CBI was earlier overlooking the PMT 2013 case. "It was only after I approached Supreme Court that the agency started looking into it," said Dr Rai, who filed a complaint before SC alleging that 270 of the 378 state-quota medical seats were sold to ineligible students by private medical colleges in PMT-2013.
 
 These private colleges were fined Rs 13 crore by Madhya Pradesh Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee after Rai's complaint. They, however, got a stay on the fine.
 
 "Private medical colleges committed irregularities in state-quota seat allotment in collusion with top DME officers," Rai alleges. He demands an inquiry into the role of former joint director DME Dr N M Shrivastava for "overlooking illegal allotments" by private institutions. "Some of the students who were given seats had scored only 40% marks," Rai alleges.
