Jalandhar: The Punjab state vigilance bureau arrested a state tax officer (earlier excise and taxation officer) of the Good and Service Tax (GST) here on Wednesday while accepting a bribe of Rs 13,000 from an advocate.

 VB senior superintendent of police (SSP) Diljinder Singh Dhillon said advocate Raju Ambedkar, who was advising business firms on sales tax issues, had complained that he had filed sales tax returns for the last three years for a local firm but STO Gurjeet Singh was not giving him the final assessment order.
 
 In his complaint to the VB, he alleged that initially Gurjeet had demanded Rs 20,000 for giving the orders, but the deal was struck for Rs 13,000 after much persuasion. However, on Wednesday he was caught red-handed while accepting the graft money by a team of the VB led by its deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Satpal in the presence of official witnesses.
