PATNA: Shaken by   poll results, RJD chief   on Sunday called for unity among all secular and progressive forces, including Mayawati and Mulayam Singh Yadav, to check PM Narendra Modi-led   in 2019 general elections.

 “RJD, JD(U) and Congress are united in Bihar. If Mayawati ji and Mulayam ji come together in UP, the BJP’s gameplan will be destroyed,” Lalu told reporters after a meeting of his party’s senior functionaries in Patna.
 
 The meeting was convened to discuss the RJD’s future plan and strategies in the wake of the BJP’s unprecedented victory in UP and Hindu hardliner Adityanath Yogi becoming the UP CM. All RJD MPs, former MPs, present and former legislators, party’s candidates who lost the last assembly and parliamentary elections and district party presidents attended the meeting chaired by Lalu. 
 
 Claiming that the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre wanted to scrap the existing reservation formula for the other backward castes, Lalu said his party would soon launch a movement across the state to put pressure on the Modi government to make the caste census public. He also reiterated RJD’s demand for allocating funds from the central budget to the OBCs, SCs and STs in proportion to their population in the country.
 
 Lalu also said his party would hold a three-day national-level training workshop on May 2, 3 and 4 at Bodh Gaya for party workers to apprise them of the BJP’s hate politics and how to counter it.
 
 He said UP CM Yogi performed a purification ritual (Shuddhikaran Puja) at his official residence in Lucknow mainly because it was occupied by either a Dalit of an OBC for over a decade.
