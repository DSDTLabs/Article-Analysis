PANAJI: Bearing resemblance to the promises it made in Delhi, the   on Saturday promised free water, free wi-fi, cheap electricity and more jobs to the people of Goa.

 The AAP’s election manifesto, released by party’s CM candidate  , has some points picked straight from the manifesto   released before its debut election in the national Capital.
 
 The party has promised 20,000 litres free water for every household, electricity at half the current rate and 400 vaddo clinics (moholla clinics in Delhi) — the promises that helped them win 67 of the 70 seats in Delhi in March 2015.
 
 While the two major parties in Delhi — the BJP and the Congress — had ridiculed the AAP’s promise, it was a major hit with the electorate. The promises were fulfilled within days of the formation of Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP government in Delhi.
 
 The AAP has also promised 50,000 jobs in five years and better security for women by creating five women only police stations — also similar to the promises made in Delhi. 
 
 After months of silence, the party also unveiled its stance on two contentious issues, which are directing the political discourse of the state. Gomes said if voted to power, the AAP would continue the grants that were being provided to schools and give more priority to keep Dabolim international airport than developing Mopa.
