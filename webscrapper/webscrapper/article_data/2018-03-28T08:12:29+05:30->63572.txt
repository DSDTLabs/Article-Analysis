GUWAHATI: A BJP MP from Assam wants   gunned down in public by shooting squads to create a sense of "fear" among the perpetrators.  , who represents Tezpur constituency, while   for rape convicts, said even minors should not get away with "lax" punishment. 

 "There should be shooting squads set up to deal with rapists. There should be a punishment of minimum 10 years in prison for assaulting, molesting or touching a woman appropriately," he said in New Delhi.
 
  Sharma was responding to the rape and murder of a class V student in Assam's Nagaon district. The girl was raped and set on fire by three persons, two of whom were minors, on Friday. 
 
 Extending his demand for "shooting squads" for minor rape convicts as well, Sharma, "A crime like rape cannot go unpunished. If a minor can commit rape, why should he be considered a juvenile? He should be given the maximum punishment as well. A rapist should be hanged or shot in public."
 
 Justifying his stand, the BJP MP said this form of punishment would "create a sense of fear" among the perpetrators. He went on to urge the state government to come up with a "deterrent law" to check the rising graph of crimes against women.
