NAVI MUMBAI: After a brief lull, illegal sand miners have struck again in Navi Mumbai and   regions. Activists have raised alarm bells about rampant sand mining at several places like Kihim beach, near Alibag,   at Mahad and also near Juinagar railway bridge in Navi Mumbai. 

  Environmentalist Sumaira Abdulali of the   shot off letters to Raigad district collector, Vijay Suryawanshi, and Konkan divisional commissioner Dr Jagdish Patil, on Thursay, seeking strong action.
 
  "I request once again that action be undertaken to permanently end illegal sand mining at Kihim Beach," wrote Abdulali.
 
  "I have also been informed that illegal sand mining has resumed along Savitri River, close to Mahad bridge. District authorities must come up with a proper plan to plug such crimes against the environment," she stressed.
 
  When TOI contacted the Raigad district collectorate, S Sutar, an official from mining department said, "At present, the government has allowed legal sand dredging to some extent in certain sections of the riverside. I will have to make further inquiries into it."
