INDORE: With the Union   2017 round the corner, the food processing industries of the region that are still grappling with the effects of demonetisation expect sops and incentives, especially for the micro and small scale industries.

 Industry participants echoed that the government should increase the subsidy on plant and machinery used in the food processing units and a single window mechanism should be implemented for smooth functioning.
 
  secretary association of   (AIMP) said, “In the upcoming budget, we expect government to announce subsidy scheme to boost small & medium enterprises.”
 
 Mehta said that the growth of small industries in the region is very less due to lack of government support and unfriendly policies.
 
 Industry participants from the food processing industry said that the government should instruct banks to stop demanding collateral against loans from the micro, small and medium enterprises.
 
 Industry experts said that the region has immense potential to emerge as a hub for value added products due to availability of raw materials.
 
 A leading industrialist from Indore who did not wish to be named said, “The growth of any industry is impossible until the government lowers interest rates on industry. We are paying the highest interest rates for which our companies fail to compete with companies in the global market.”
 
 Industry leaders said that the government should also create a favourable atmosphere for the industries. Labour unrest immensely hampers industrial growth.
 
  president   said, “The industries of the region mainly FMGC and small scale industries have been badly hit by demonetisation. Market will take another six months to a year to improve. Government should announce incentives for the industries to come back on track.
