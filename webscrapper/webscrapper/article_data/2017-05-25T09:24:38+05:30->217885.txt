LUCKNOW: Growth of   in the city is not an overnight phenomenon, rather a result of disregard of building bylaws by development authority   over last several years, admitted   vice-chairman P N Singh at the board meeting on Wednesday. He has, therefore, announced to release shortly a list of such engineers who have allowed flouting of building bylaws right under their nose. 

 So far,   used to release list of only those offenders whose properties were under their scanner for either not getting a map approved by the authority or constructing beyond the design approved. But after high court intervened and asked the authority to explain why so many cases of illegal construction had cropped up in city despite full-fledged RBO (Regulation of Building Operation) Wing of LDA operating, the authorities have swung into action.
 
 LDA’s recent survey suggests that more than 70% of the buildings in the city are illegal because they trespass map limits and flout building bylaws. Of these, LDA court has already issued demolition orders for over 1,700 buildings till date but its execution is pending. A lot many illegal constructions are owned by high-profile individuals like politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats in city who have appealed in the LDA court for relief. 
 
 P N Singh said, “Along with public, LDA engineers are also responsible for overlooking norms. It was their job to see that construction is as per law. We will soon be issuing list of engineers too along with the offenders who have been supervising these areas but have failed to take any action till date.”
 
 The high court has also sought list of engineers from LDA who have allegedly allowed illegal constructions in their jurisdiction over last 10 years. There have been many complaints in the past that LDA engineers don’t keep a check on unauthorised construction and give it a go-ahead to fulfil personal benefits turning a blind-eye to the anomalies.
