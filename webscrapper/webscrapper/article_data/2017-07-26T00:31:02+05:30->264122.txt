Madurai: With temperature soaring at more than 40 degree Celsius, doctors advise people to drink more fluids, especially   water and wear sunglasses to protect one’s eyes. As tender coconut prices are skyrocket, the common man finds it difficult to access them.

 Many doctors in the city say that the best way to overcome afternoon heat is to consume tender coconut, but this is one commodity that is not easily available in the city at present. The fruit which was sold at Rs40 is now sold at Rs65 and above in most places. N Ganapathy, who has a tender coconut stall at K K Nagar for the past 30 years, said that this is one of the worst seasons he has seen.
 
 “Madurai usually gets about one lakh tender coconuts per day, but now it is even difficult to access 10,000 quality fruits,” he said. Ganapathy also said that the quantity of tender coconut water has also gone down due to the prevailing drought condition. “I only buy the big coconuts from Pollachi and each tender coconut will contain about 600 ml of juice, but now even the bigger fruits have less than 400 ml,” he said. 
 
 Also, continuous exposure to high heat and glare can damage the eyes, so people who are out in the sun for long hour need to wear sunglasses and those who do not like glasses, must atleast wear coloured contact lenses says Dr A B Rajukumar of Agarwal’s Eye Hospital, Madurai. The radiation can affect the central part of the retina and can even lead to vision loss. It is also advisable to maintain the moisture in the eye, by placing coolants like slices of lemon or cucumber over the eyes, while resting, he added.
