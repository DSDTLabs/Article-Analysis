The much-acclaimed award winning Indian film, ‘The Pink Mirror’ ( ), which focuses on the life of transsexuals in India, is up on   for audiences world over. Ecstatic about this,  , the director of the film and gay rights activist, says, “For this film to be made, the odds were against us. However, it is a momentous occasion where the film is opening up to the world on one of the best platforms. This is where the second journey of the film starts, and I am very curious to see the path it carves for itself.” 
The movie is about two Indian drag queens, engrossed in a battle, trying to woo a handsome hunk. The film is a blend of typical Bollywood songs, dance and drama and explores other veiled issues related to the Indian gay community, including the ever-present threat of HIV/AIDS.
 
 The movie, which was made in 2002, has been a favourite at festivals and has been screened at over 70 international festivals, bagging top honors along the way. The film has also become an invaluable asset to university libraries worldwide as a resource material on queer Asian cinema and gender studies.
 
 The film stars (late) Edwin Fernandes and Ramesh Menon as the drag queens Shabbo and Bibbo, and Rishi Raj as the gay teenager, Mandy. Ramesh recounts, “Shooting for the movie was the first time I faced the camera. I was disheartened as the censor did not pass the movie, though there was no vulgarity in the movie. It is a Bollywood-style fun movie. I’m very happy that all those who missed the movie can watch it on Netflix now. I was surprised when friends from India and abroad called to say that they saw the movie after so many years!” Rishi, who is now a stylist and fashion choreographer, adds, “The film was made with the intent of reaching out to all. I’m glad it is available on Netflix and other online movie platforms.”
