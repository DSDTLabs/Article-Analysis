PUNE: A thief smashed the window of a car parked near the   and stole a laptop worth Rs62,000.

 The complainant, Rakesh Alkunte (40), had parked the car in a lane near the club around 8.30pm. When he returned around 11pm, he found his car’s window broken and his laptop missing. 
 
  
 An officer from the Deccan Gymkhana police station said they are checking the area’s CCTV cameras. “We are hoping the CCTV footage will help us identify the thief. There were many cars parked in the lane but the laptop was stolen from just this car,” the officer said. 
 
 Over the last few weeks, thieves have targeted parked cars in the Deccan area, mainly on Jangli Maharaj Road, Fergusson College Road and Prabhat Road. The suspects either break the car’s window or divert the driver’s attention by throwing currency notes on the road. 
 
 A crime branch officer said the police have identified a few suspects and are searching for them. “They operate in gangs and are mainly from Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Some gang members leave the city immediately after stealing the valuables,” the officer said, adding hat most thefts have occurred between Friday and Sunday.
