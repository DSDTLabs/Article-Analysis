PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: NCP leader   on Tuesday alleged that the BJP has an image of being `mischief mongers’ after some leaders from other political parties with criminal records were inducted. 

 He said BJP has been taking in leaders tainted by extortion, externment, and murders. “The   has expressed displeasure over this,” he added. All political parties should act against criminals, he said. 
 
 The BJP has not fulfilled its promises about ‘acche din’, black money, or illegal constructions, as well as penalty tax on unauthorized constructions, Pawar said. Over 50 lakh people have lost their jobs in the two and half months of demonetization, Pawar alleged.
 
 “The Modi government took a unilateral decision about demonetization. Corruption has increased and the cooperative movement is in a shambles. Farmers are helpless,” Pawar said. 
 
 Pawar said the party is likely to form an alliance with the Congress in   depending on the strengths of their respective parties.
 
 “We are positive about the alliance if it is done gracefully. The NCP in 2012 had won 83 seats while the Congress was reduced to 14 seats. Last month, seven Congress corporators joined the NCP,” Pawar said. Over the last five years, the NCP has implemented several development projects in Pimpri Chinchwad and the party will win with a majority in these civic elections as well, he said.
 
 He warned leaders who left the NCP to join BJP recently from returning to the NCP after it comes to power in Pimpri Chinchwad.
