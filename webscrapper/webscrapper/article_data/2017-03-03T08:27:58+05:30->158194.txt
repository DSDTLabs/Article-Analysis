NAGPUR: The Maharashtra government on Thursday informed the Nagpur bench of   that it has increased   from two litres/month to three per individual having valid ration card. Moreover, a family of two would be getting four litres/month from the earlier three. 

 A big family would be getting eight litres/month from the earlier six. The government sought three months for completion of stamping of all beneficiaries. 
 
 The case was listed before a division bench comprising justices Bhushan Gavai and Indira Jain. It was filed by   villager Kawduji Pund Mirza alleging discrimination in allotment of   quota for rural areas. tnn
 
 The petitioner contended that though requirement of kerosene is more in rural areas, the quota fixed by government is two litres per beneficiary per month in comparison to four litres in urban households, and of late, it was reduced to 470 ML. Following it, the court granted an interim stay to governmentâ€™s existing kerosene distribution policy on July 1, 2015, terming it as palpable, arbitrary and irrational.
 
 Earlier, Mirza pointed out that even though the centre provided three litre/person in a month to state, latter reduced it to two litre/month. He informed that state failed to pick up its quota that led to reduction from the centre. In turn, the state gets cash incentive in purchase of kerosene.
