PUNE: The demand for diverting the  's funds for projects out of the city limits got a green signal on Friday, nearly a month after it was rejected. 

 The   corporators approved the diversion of Rs10 crore despite opposition from the other parties in the general body meeting. "The funds will be diverted for carrying out sewage disposal works at Mangadewadi, Gujar Nimbalkarwadi and  ," stated the proposal tabled before the general body on Friday.
 
 The   and the MNS corporators opposed the move, stressing that the civic body did not have money to complete projects in the city and so diverting funds for other governing bodies would be an injustice to the residents of Pune.
 
 "We are not against carrying out development works on the fringes of the city. But we should look into the issues of the city first," stressed the opposition parties' corporators.
 
 The BJP leaders supported the diversion of funds, claiming that the money will ultimately help the people living in civic limits adjacent to the villages. "The water of Katraj lake is getting polluted due to sewage from villages. It is not only a threat to the health of the citizens, but also spreading foul odour," one among them said.
 
 All the projects proposed in the municipal budget will get less funds than promised as the   standing committee has decided to cut the allocations of the 2017-18 budget. The civic body hopes to save around Rs209 crore with this move. The BJP leaders also scrapped four welfare schemes for funds crunch.
