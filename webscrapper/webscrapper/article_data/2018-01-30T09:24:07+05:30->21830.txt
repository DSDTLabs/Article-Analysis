VADODARA: Bijli Kaur Sikligar, who was set ablaze by her husband Gulzar Singh as she  , succumbed to her injuries at a private hospital on   on Monday.

 On January 26, Singh had come home asking for money from his wife for gambling. He had already lost an amount but wanted more cash so that he can recover the lost money, police said. Kaur refused to give him money, which had led to a verbal altercation between the couple.
 
 He then dragged her outside the house and had even abused in public. He then brought a carboy of kerosene from the kitchen, splashed it on her and set her ablaze. The coupleâ€™s neighbours rushed to her rescue and doused the fire. She was then taken to SSG Hospital but was shifted to a private one on Sunday.
 
 Singh, who too had received burn injuries, was arrested by police on the same day for attempting to killing his wife. Currently he is lodged in Vadodara central jail. Police have now booked Singh for murder.
