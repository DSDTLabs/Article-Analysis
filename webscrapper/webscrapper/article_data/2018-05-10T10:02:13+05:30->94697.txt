PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Khadki and Dehu Road cantonment boards have submitted memorandums to the   seeking solution to the problems in their respective areas.

 The memorandums were submitted to defence minister   at a meeting of vice-presidents from 62 cantonment boards and   in New Delhi recently.
 
 The   has urged that the state government and the Union government schemes be implemented in cantonment areas; Parliament should amend the Cantonment Act 2006 to restore the voting rights of citizens living in unauthorised constructions; and the cantonments be given the authority to sanction their budgets.
 
 The   has demanded that the ministry should reduce the area under red zone and has sought permission to reconstruct the Buddha Vihar in Dehu Road. The demands were listed by Abhay Sawant, vice-president, KCB, and Vishal Khandelwal, vice-president of DCB.
 
 Among others present at the meeting included: Subhash Bhamre, Union minister of state for defence; Jnaneshwar Sharma, director general of defence estates, Delhi; and around 40 MPs.
 
 Sawant said, “The cantonments cannot implement several government welfare schemes as they do not have grants for them. Therefore, we demanded that the cantonments be given grants to implement such schemes.”
 
 Khandelwal said, “In many cases, the red zone areas were declared after civilians constructed their houses and other structures. As a result, the cantonment has stopped giving permissions for new constructions and repairing old constructions in the prohibited areas which is causing inconvenience to thousands of residents. So, we have demanded that the radius of the red zones be reduced.”
