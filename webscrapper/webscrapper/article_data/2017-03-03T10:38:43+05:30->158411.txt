 Excerpts from a quick chat :
 
 
 
 
 While Saath Nibhana Saathiya was huge, I think this is the biggest break for me on TV . I loved Diya Aur Baati Hum because it talked about women empowerment and girl education, which is praiseworthy. The sequel will do the same. I can relate to my character because I play an ambitious and intelligent young student.For about one and half months, we shot in Rajasthan and Kerala, and it was real fun.
 
 
  
 
 It gets tough at times. The day before my exams, I was shooting in Kerala.So I studied during my journey.Although I reached the exam hall 15 minutes late, I did well. My school has been very supportive. Usually, when I am shooting in Mumbai, I study on the sets even during short breaks.
