AHMEDABAD: In an alarming sign of just how apathetically   are checked in the state, a class XII general stream student was passed by the teacher assessing his economics paper despite him writing only expletives as answers in five questions. The   imagining being in love with Bollywood stars Aishwarya Rai and Rani Mukherjee. Despite this, the Rajkot boy was passed with 36 marks!

 When the moderator saw the paper, he noted the anomaly and failed the student giving him 14 marks while deducting 22 marks for penning expletives and pornography. The teacher who seemed to have mechanically checked the answersheet was also fined Rs 1,000. 
 
 “It was apparent that the teacher, who is employed with a self-financed school, had not read the paper while checking. This kind of callous and negligent attitude towards paper checking can prove disastrous for the quality of education,” said a former examination secretary of the board.
 
 Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) vice-chairman R R Thakkar said that this year, 1,000 teachers, who assessed class 12 general stream papers, were fined Rs 10 lakh for errors in paper checking.
 
 Similarly, 444 teachers, who assessed class 12 science stream papers, were fined Rs 3,50,000. 
 
 “Majority of errors were in totalling and there have been instances where teachers have given 49 marks to a student who scored 18 marks; 81 to a student who scored 40 and 75 to one who scored 57 marks. This kind of negligence can prove extremely detrimental to future of students whose careers depend on marks scored,” said Thakkar.
