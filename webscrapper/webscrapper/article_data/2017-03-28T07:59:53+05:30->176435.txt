HYDERABAD: Over 100 parents of   in Lalaguda staged a   premises on Monday, against the management's move to implement a 30% hike in fee for the 2017-18 academic year. The parents raised slogans and sat on dharna demanding a reduction in the annual fee. The local police was forced to intervene to bring the situation under control. 

 The incident took place when a group of parents visited the school affiliated to the  , to seek a clarification from the management over the arbitrary fee hike. When they failed to get any response from the concerned officials, they took to a protest. "About 10-15 per cent hike is an annual practice followed by the school. But this year, the management has increased the fee by almost 30 per cent without consulting the parents. It is not fair as we cannot cough up so much money towards school fee every year," said B Prabhakar, president of the Takshashila Public School Parents Association. 
 
 Parents also objected to the addition of new components in the fee structure this time around. "Apart from the tuition fee and the term fee, the school has levied multiple additional charges such as English lab fee, computer fee, board exam fee, etc, this year. The amount of money being charged for textbooks in the new academic year is also much higher than the market price of these books," complained L  , a parent.
