NAGPUR: The mixed doubles pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N   provided the silver lining after   and   flattered to decieve in the   Super Series   tournament in Tokyo on Friday.

 Getting better with every tournament, Chopra and Reddy have achieved perhaps the best result of their career by entering the Super Series semis for the first time.
 
 In a nail-biting mixed doubles quarterfinal, world No. 19 Chopra and Reddy squeezed past Seung Jae Seo and Kim Ha Na of South Korea 21-18, 9-21, 21-19 in 58 minutes. Although the Koreans are ranked No. 50 - much lower than the Indian duo - they had recorded two upset wins in the tournament, including the win over sixth seeds from Denmark, Mads Conrad-Petersen and Mads Pieler Kolding.
 
 Incidentaly, Chopra and Reddy became only the second Indian pair to play Super Series semis. DJ Viju and Jwala Gutta was the last Indian pair - though mixed - to reach Super Series semis around six years ago. The in-form Indian duo will now clash with Japan’s Takuro Hoki and Sayaka Hirota. The Japanese are qualifiers and ranked world No. 146 in the world. Indians will have a golden chance to advance to their maiden final on Saturday.
 
 “It was a very good match. The most important was the beginning of the third game which we started quite well and jumped into crucial lead. We lost the lead after a mandatory 11-point break, but we could keep patience and get some rhythm back towards the end,” said Chopra, the winner of Scottish, Russian and Syed Modi Grand Prix titles in 2016 with Reddy.
 
 The 25-year-old Chopra admitted that it was one of their most memorable day in international badminton. “It is good show for us to reach semis here but we definitely need more such results in the future,” added Chopra.
 
 The way Srikanth and Prannoy played on Thursday on their way to straight-game wins, fans were expecting a similar performance in the quarters. However, both the Indian singles players failed to advance. Srikanth went down to recently crowned world champion and third seed Viktor Axelsen of Denmark 17-21, 17-21 in 40 minutes. 
 
 World No. 19 Prannoy failed to get past second seed Chinese Shi Yuqi 15-21, 14-21 in 45 minutes.
