GHAZIABAD: The proposed project to supply   to   and   may not see the light of day. 

 This is because the UP Jal Nigam has demanded Rs 300 crore from the cash-strapped   Municipal Corporation (GMC) for the project. Residents of these two areas have been demanding Ganga jal supply because of the depleting groundwater table.
 
 The demand was made at a recent meeting, convened by the state chief secretary, in Lucknow.
 
 “UP Jal Nigam has demanded Rs 300 crore from us and they say the amount will be spent to fix the upper Ganga canal which runs from Haridwar to Dasna in Ghaziabad to stop water loss,” said CP Singh, municipal commissioner.
 
  “GMC is not in a position to spend such a huge amount of money on work that ideally should have been done by Jal Nigam from its own money, the demand is unreasonable,” he said.
 
 The GMC chief said the civic body’s inability to provide the funds for the project, has been conveyed to the UP Jal Nigam and “the ball is now in their court”, he added.
 
 Explaining the importance of Ganga jal supply in Mohan Nagar and Rajnagar extension, Singh said, “As of now, Ganga jal is supplied to Indirapuram township only, but given the fact that Ghaziabad’s groundwater table being critically low we would not be able to meet water demands of the city in years to come. So ultimately we will have to gradually develop water infrastructure in the city wherein Gangajal could be used to cater to water demands, thereby shedding the dependence of groundwater.”
 
 When contacted, executive engineer of UP Jal Nigam NK Lamba said, “We are supplying Ganga jal to Agra, Noida and parts of Ghaziabad. The water intake of the upper Ganga canal is hardly able to meet such a demand and under these conditions, we will not be able to supply Ganga jal to any new areas unless we manage to fix canal of its water loss problem.”
