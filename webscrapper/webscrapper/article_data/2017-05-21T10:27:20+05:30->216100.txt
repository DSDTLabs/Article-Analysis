VIJAYAWADA: In a twist in the case relating to the death of cancer-affected Sai Sri, her father   on Saturday alleged that his daughter was murdered by his ex-wife Sumasree and her present husband  . He even claimed that their neighbours had heard her cries. 

 Speaking to STOI, Sivakumar said he would lodge a complaint, with evidence, at the Suryaraopet police station on Monday. "My daughter was murdered by her mother and her present husband," he asserted. 
 
 Polina Krishna is also facing charges of cheating his first wife, Neelima, by illegally marrying Sumasree. "My husband told the media that he spent 25 lakh on his step-daughter. All I am asking him is to take care of his own daughters first before speaking like a saint," Neelima told STOI. 
 
 On Saturday, Neelima approached DCP Palaraju's office seeking justice for her two daughters P Rajeswari (9) and   (7). Neelima, who had married Krishna in 2008, accused Sumasree and Krishna of thrashing her two daughters and throwing them out of her house in Hyderabad. She alleged that neither of them wanted to take care of Sai Sri, but only fought for control over property. Neelima also approached the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) seeking justice.
 
 Meanwhile, in a press release, Sivakumar said he is willing to donate his property to   in memory of his daughter.
