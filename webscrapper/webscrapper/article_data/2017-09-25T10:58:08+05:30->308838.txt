BENGALURU: Alleging that he was cheated of Rs 21 after he purchased a   from a city mall, a Cottonpet resident dragged the outlet owner to consumer court for unfair trade practice and won a compensation of Rs 12,000, including a nominal litigation fee.

 The case unfolded at the third additional   Redressal Forum, following a complaint by Raghavendra KP against the vendor, GS Enterprises in Royal Meenakshi Mall on Bannerghatta Road, and manufacturer Coca-Cola. The complainant alleged that the storekeeper had on December 5, 2015, sold him a 1 litre water bottle for Rs 40, instead of its MRP of Rs 19.
 
 Raghavendra claimed that he had purchased a similar water bottle from a shop in Jayanagar the same evening for Rs 19. Submitting invoices of both purchases, he stressed that the store in the mall had caused him a loss of Rs 21, and Coca-Cola had connived with the   to cheat consumers. The court started hearing the case in early 2016. The store, represented by its proprietor, stated that the complaint was false, frivolous and vexatious.
