PUNE: After two passengers, including a woman, were caught at the   airport last month while trying to smuggle out foreign currency worth Rs 1.29 crore, which was concealed in hot cases containing ‘upma’, customs authorities have tightened security at the departure lounge of the facility.

 An official told TOI that additional personnel have been deployed in the departure bay to keeping a close watch on passengers leaving from Pune.
 
 “The recent incident in which two persons flying to Dubai were apprehended for carrying foreign currency in hot cases of ‘upma’ took place in the departure area and we believe that keeping an eye on passengers leaving from Pune is important now than ever. In a bid to prevent such incidents, we have stepped up our security measures,” a customs official said.
 
 On August 8, two persons scheduled to fly to Dubai on an   flight were carrying four casseroles filled with upma, a breakfast option. The officials recovered foreign currency worth Rs1.29 crore (in Euro and USD) from the casseroles.
 
 “The incident prompted us to closely watch the departure area as well. Though much cannot be disclosed, our men in uniform as well as civil attire, are now maintaining a close watch on the movements of passengers, especially those leaving for international destinations,” another official said.
 
 Customs authorities in the past have successfully nabbed people trying to smuggle   into the country from the Lohegaon airport. “With the move, we expect that smuggling articles in and out of the country will be difficult. Moreover, with the festive season approaching, the security checks will be more stringent,” the official said.
