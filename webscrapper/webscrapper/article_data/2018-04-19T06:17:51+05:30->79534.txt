KOLKATA: The 77-year-old   School is giving up its traditional outlook to start a co-educational campus. The idea, to inculcate a culture of mutual respect between the sexes right from nursery, comes at a time when news of atrocities against women scream out of newspapers and TV channels.

 The institute, one of the premier CBSE schools in the city, has opened a new campus at   and started admitting students for this academic session.
 
 
 Unlike its previous campuses on  , which are separate for boys and girls, this one will be co-educational. S  , the chairman of   —the holding society for all S KBirla group schools — said, “We need to change our traditional views with changing times. Everyday you see how women are tortured and murdered. I think we can counter this only if we train our boys to respect girls right from the nursery stage by helping them grow up together in the same classroom.”
