THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In what could be termed as the beginning of a strategic alliance between two like-minded neighbouring states, Kerala and Karnataka will send delegations for the   

 A contingent of Kerala police will attend the Independence Day parade at Bengaluru on August 15, while another one from Karnataka will join the parade in Thiruvananthapuram.
 
 Announcing the decision on Facebook, chief minister   said the step was an effort to improve coordination between forces. “Such initiatives will contribute to improving the relations between neighbouring states,” said Vijayan.
 
 Though Vijayan termed the decision as a gesture to improve cordial relation between both states, political observers see a larger agenda behind the decision. 
 
 Congress leader and Karnataka chief minister   and Pinarayi Vijayan are two chief ministers who oppose BJP’s agendas vehemently. Both leaders not only fight BJP effectively on their home turfs, but also challenge many decisions of the   government effectively.
 
 “A couple of days ago, Siddaramaiah wrote to the Centre urging them to remove Hindi signboards at Metro stations in Bengaluru. On earlier occasions too, he had taken bold stand against the Centre’s fascist initiatives,” said a source in the government.
 
 When the Union government issued a notification regulating cattle trade in the country, Vijayan had written to all chief ministers cautioning them about the Centre’s move to usurp state’s powers and hinting at the need for a broad coalition to fight such unconstitutional moves. 
 
 Tripura CM  , who is also a nominee of the CPM, was the only chief minister who responded to Vijayan’s letter then. 
 
 But, several non-BJP chief ministers had hinted then that they supported the move.
