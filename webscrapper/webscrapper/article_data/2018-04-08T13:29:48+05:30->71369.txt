RAJKOT: Carcass of eight peacocks were found in Tavadva village of   taluka in   on Saturday. Two other peacocks that were alive were sent for treatment. 

 The forest officials believe that the national bird died due to food poisoning. Their viscera samples have been sent for forensic testing.   falls under the category of Scheduled-I species and anybody found hurting or hunting the bird is punished under the law. 
 
 However, after primary investigation, forest officials did not find any conspiracy angle. Assistant conservator of forests, Bhavnagar, V R   said, “We believe that the reason for death could be consumption of pesticide. If anybody would had given poison intentionally, then he/she may try to hide the carcass, but nothing like that was found.” 
 
 “Sometimes when a peacock feeds on grain with pesticide, the bird gets infected, but the same thing does not get reflected in the forensic report,” Rathod added.
