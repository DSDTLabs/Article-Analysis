BENGALURU: Australian captain  , already smarting under the series loss to India, found himself in a fresh controversy on Wednesday with former Australian fast bowler   accusing him of favouritism in picking the XI.

 Smith has been under fire for a while now having lost 11 off their last 13 ODIs overseas. “They're picking their mates. Smith shouldn't be a selector. (Ashton) Agar's been pushed through and (Hilton) Cartwright's still there. We saw (Nic) Maddinson get selected (he's) a mate, he's one of Steve Smith's mates You can't pick bloody mates! I think the captain's getting his own way,” the 66-year-old ex-pacer said.
 
 However, the 28-year-old top-order batsman found support from his deputy David Warner, who brushed aside the accusations. “It's up to the selectors to pick the team. A player can't help being picked or not being picked.”
