CHANDIGARH: The   (CHB) has extended the   for depositing discounted penal charges for building violations to April 15. The board has extended the date from March 31 to April 15.

 After deposit of the penal charges, the notice of misuse, violation, encroachment will be withdrawn until further orders. Over the years, the residents have been urging the administration to allow changes to meet the growing needs. The owners of CHB dwelling units have made changes in their properties in violation of norms, for which they are facing notices.
 
 CHB has developed house schemes in different sectors, including 29, 41, 40, 44, 43, 45, 47, 38 (west) and Modern Housing Complex, with around 64,000 units. The board has also developed rehabilitation housing schemes.
 
 The board has allowed need-based changes in the dwelling units through various orders from time to time subject to conditions. However, there are many allottees, who made additional constructions in their dwelling units which do not fulfill the conditions mentioned in need-based changes and cannot be regularised.
 
 Further, many of the allottees have raised construction outside the plot area. Such allottees have been approaching CHB for regularisation of the same as the construction was done many years ago and any modification to such construction to bring it in accordance to the byelaws is not feasible at this stage.
 
 In order to give temporary exemption to the allottees from immediate demolition of additional construction, the board has imposed a penal charge, which is payable with immediate effect. Further, a rebate has been allowed to the allottees, who will deposit the penal charge on or before April 15 on basis of self-certification.
