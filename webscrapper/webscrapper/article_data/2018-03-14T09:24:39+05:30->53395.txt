AURANGABAD: Solapur MLC Prashant   is in fresh trouble as ex-servicemen from   on Tuesday demanded cancellation of his membership from the legislative council and registration of offence under sedition charges against him. 

 Members of the Beed district ex-servicemen's organization took a morcha to the Beed district collectorate to push their demand against the BJP-backed independent MLC.
 
 During an election campaign last year, Paricharak had sarcastically remarked that soldiers stationed at the border distribute sweets when their babies are born, although they haven't come home in a year. 
 
 The MLC was suspended from the council following an uproar on the issue and opposition onslaught. However, his suspension was revoked last month.
 
 "Paricharak's statement has hurt our feelings and that of our families. The authorities concerned added insult to injury by revoking the MLC's suspension," said  , an ex-serviceman, who has taken up farming following his retirement in 2013. 
 
 "We dont interfere in politics. Why should these people meddle in our affairs, that too by making such insulting remarks," he added. 
 
 Describing their rally as the first of its kind in the state against Paricharak, the ex-servicemen threatened to launch a severe agitation across   if his membership is not cancelled permanently and offence not registered against him under sedition charges. 
 
 "This statement (Paricharak's) would discourage youngsters who want to join the armed forces," said  , a leftist leader who joined the ex-servicemen in their agitation against Paricharak.
