BATHINDA: Even as Punjab chief minister (CM) Parkash Singh Badal and deputy chief minister   are visiting the entire state to campaign for Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidates, another member of the Badal clan, Union food processing industry minister  , has limited campaigning to   district. 

 Of the nine assembly constituencies in Bathinda parliamentary seat, she is mainly concentrating on Bathinda Urban segment and taking on her husband Sukhbir Badal’s cousin and former Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who is contesting on a   ticket from there. 
 
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election from Bathinda, Harsimrat had trailed behind   by 30,000 votes from Bathinda Urban. She is working to pacify angry Akali workers, even as many of them have switched over to the Congress to support Manpreet.
 
 Harsimrat is playing the emotional card to get people on her side. Addressing a rally for SAD’s Bathinda Urban candidate, Sarup Chand Singla, Harsimrat said, “I still feel bad for losing by 29,316 votes to Manpreet Badal despite winning the Lok Sabha election by 19,395 votes. Despite trailing from Bathinda Urban, neither me nor my family held a grudge against the town’s voters and ensured its all-round development. We brought a cancer hospital,   and AIIMS to Bathinda, and are committed to doing much more for the town.”
 
 She called Manpreet a traitor and a back-stabber. She said no one knew Manpreet better than her family. “Manpreet backstabbed his taaya (uncle) who had launched him in politics. Likewise, he will not stand by anyone if Bathinda residents made him win.”
 
 Taking on Harsimrat, Manpreet said, “She is feeling that she is losing Bathinda once and for all. This fear is making her level baseless charges and term SAD opponents as traitors or backstabbers. They must look within before speaking.”
