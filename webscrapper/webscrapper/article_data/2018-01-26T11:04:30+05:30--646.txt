BHOPAL: In a major setback to  , the state failed to secure a place in the list of airports to be connected under UDAN 2. The state was not considered in the first list too. According to the government, airlines say that they do not find enough business in the state due to which MP has failed to figure in the UDAN 2 list. Incidentally, the state had proposed 22 runways to bag a place in the second list.

 The aviation ministry on Wednesday announced that 325 routes have been awarded in the second round of UDAN ( ) scheme.   and Alliance Air, which had joined the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) in the first round itself, have been given more routes. However, MP missed the bus again. When contacted, principal secretary Ashok   said the state already has air taxis for intrastate connectivity. “We have Prabhatam services run by the tourism, so there is no issue as far as local connectivity is concerned,” he added. 
 
 Asked the reason for not getting place in the list, Warnawal said, “Airlines do not think there is much business in the state for them. We will see if we get place in the future plan of UDAN.” However, airport officials are not ready to buy this statement. 
 
 “How come connectivity with Indore is increasing? There must by some reason why more services are there. Likewise, other airports could be connected,” said an official without quoting his name. He claimed that the passengers travelling to Indore from Bhopal for other destinations is quite high. 
 
 “It means there is no problem of business as such. There is need to organise regular interactions with airlines and tell them about facilities our airport can provide. Only then we can create an environment and convince airlines that there is enough potential here,” said officials.
