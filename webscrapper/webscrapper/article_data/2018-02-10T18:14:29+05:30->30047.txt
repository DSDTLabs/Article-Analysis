NEW DELHI:   president   on Saturday accused Prime Minister   of 'driving' the country with his gaze fixed firmly on the rear-view mirror. Rahul was addressing a rally in Karnataka, which goes to the polls later this year. 

 
 "PM Modi drives while looking in the rear-view mirror. That's why he drives the car into potholes. To lead India, he will have to look forward, not back," Rahul said at a rally in Karnataka's Hospete.
 
 "PM Modi's backward-looking thought caused demonetisation and 'Gabbar Singh Tax'," he jibed.
 
 He attacked Prime Minister Modi on the Rafale deal, and alleged the contract was changed to favour a "friend".
  
 Rahul appreciated Karnataka chief minister   for "doing his job," but mocked Modi, asking him "when he will do his work."
 
 The previous   state government, led by former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa, "broke the world record in corruption," the Congress chief charged.
 
 Urging the state's people to not trust those who make "false promises," he claimed "Modi's words are hollow."
 
 Striking an emotional note, Rahul recalled how Ballari "stood with Sonia Gandhi and chose her when she needed you."
 
 "I share a special connection with Ballari. You stood with Sonia Gandhi and chose her when she needed you. I will never forget this in my life," he said.
