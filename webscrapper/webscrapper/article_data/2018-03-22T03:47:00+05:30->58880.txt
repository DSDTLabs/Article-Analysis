Margao: The recent move of the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) to hike the rent charges for  , Margao, and introduce refundable security deposits for the purpose, has irked a group of social activists. 

 They have demanded that the MMC withdraw the decision immediately.
 
 The MMC has begun charging Rs 500 towards rent charges for the use of Lohia maidan and Rs 10,000 towards the refundable security deposit. 
 
 An activist Mahesh Nayak told reporters on Wednesday that the move impinged on the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression as the exorbitant fees were “beyond the normal citizen’s reach”.
 
 Activist Laurel Abranches termed the move as “suppression of the voice of the people” and demanded its immediate revocation. 
 
 The hike in fees of Lohia maidan by the MMC follows a protest by a group of conscientious citizens of Margao, led by veteran freedom fighter Gurunath Kelekar, last month, against the civic body’s failure in ensuring proper maintenance of the historic landmark. 
 
 They had pointed out that the place was being frequented by vagabonds, beggars and anti-social elements.
 
 The MMC has now also restricted entry to the maidan.
