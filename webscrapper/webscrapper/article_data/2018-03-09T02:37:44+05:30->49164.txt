NEW DELHI: The draw of lots for   admission at private schools was delayed a second time on Thursday after the directorate of education claimed it received a   recently. DoE officials say it would now happen on March 15.

 “In the meantime, my team is also sending out messages to the parents about the delay,” said director of education  .
 
 She said there were two orders that were posted by Delhi high court on the same day, one of which was received recently. “We would like to be on the right side of the law before making any further move,” Gupta told TOI.
 
 The said order passed on February 21 tells DoE to include unfilled EWS seats from the previous year and fill them up with pending applications. DoE has also been asked why several private schools were not offering admission under the 5% disability   and the number of unfilled seats in that category. DoE is to submit a compliance report by March 14.
 
 Another order passed on the same day also pointed out several “limitations” on the admission web portal. The division bench of justices S Ravindra Bhat and A K Chawla observed on February 21 that there are issues on the portal pertaining to date of birth, area code etc. It observed that there was an age limit that was excluding students, and changes must be made to “ensure that the widest choice is given to the applicants”.
 
 The bench also ordered that the portal be updated on a weekly basis and a compliance report submitted. DoE officials said this was being factored in.
 
 But parents are anxious. “The parents got to know on Wednesday through the official circular that it has been delayed by a day, but they got anxious when no result was declared on Thursday either. Word about the postponement came only after 3pm,” said Dharamveer, an NGO worker who helps to fill up forms.
 
 Message sent to parents said the draw of lots would take place on March 15 and results would be communicated via SMS on March 16.
