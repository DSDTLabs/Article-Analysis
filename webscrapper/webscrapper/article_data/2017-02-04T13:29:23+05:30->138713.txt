   is surrounded with speculations about his marriage these days. Ever since he left for home from the   house, fans have just been talking about his wedding.
 
  Now we have it directly from the horseâ€™s mouth that the rumours are just not rumours and the   10 winner is actually married. Along with this information, Manveer also said that he got separated from his wife within six months of his marriage and also has a daughter.
  
  In a video posted by Manveer Gurajar on his Instagram profile, Manveer says, "People have been questioning a lot, so let me make it clear that my wedding had nothing to do with the show. People who thought that I hid my marriage because of the show, then it is not true. My terms have not been good, as you can call it emotional blackmail or say that I was under a lot of pressure."
  
  
 
  
  "I got married in 2014 and stayed together for 5-6 months. Then things started getting bad from their side and she had left me. When I prepared myself for Bigg Boss, that time I did not think that it would be my strategy or I would make a relation with someone and help the show generate TRP's," he added.
  
  The video was posted on Friday (February 3) and was captioned, "Please check my video Message all My fans And Followers."
