PUNE: The standing committee of the   on Tuesday gave its nod to the long pending proposal to construct a flyover between 7 Loves Chowk and Warehouse Corporation near Market Yard on the busy Nehru Road.

 The   will spend Rs28.31 crore on the project, which is is expected to streamline the traffic in the area.
 
 The 648-metre-long flyover will have a 222-metre ramp at 7 Loves Chowk. The length of the ramp on the Market Yard side will be 140 metres. Its span will be 9 metres wide and cater to vehicles travelling in opposite directions.
 
 The corporation’s standing committee chairman,  , said the proposal was cleared after a detailed discussion. The tenders submitted for the project quoted costs below the estimated expenses, he said.
 
 The flyover work is expected to be over in two years. The two-way flyover will be an additional facility for the vehicles travelling towards Market Yard, Bibvewadi, Bhavani Peth and Pune station.
 
 Local corporator   said he had been following up the project with the administration for the past nine years. “Finally, it has received a nod. There is a plan to start the work at the earliest. The facility will eliminate the need to wait at three chowks. At present, vehicles take at least 15 minutes to half-an-hour to cross the Market Yard area because of halts at the traffic signals and slow moving traffic,” he said.
 
 Bhimale said a proposal was under consideration to use the canal-side road, connecting the Nehru Road and  , to streamline traffic movement during the civil work of the flyover. “The road facility is there but vehicles do not use it at present. Talks will be held with the irrigation department to find out how the road can be utilized during the work,” he said.
