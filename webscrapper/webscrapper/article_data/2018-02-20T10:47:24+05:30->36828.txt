TUTICORIN: The   (VOC) Port in   has created a new record by handling 45,396 metric   of coal in 24 hours at IX berth from the vessel MV Sea Hope on Monday. Thus, it has surpassed the previous record of 41,376 metric tonnes of coal in 24 hours at IX berth from the vessel MV Shi Dai-11 on November 13, 2014. 

 Chairman of port trust, I   said the port is continuously striving to achieve improvement in performance and productivity in order to attract more volume of traffic through the Port. He thanked all the stakeholders, officers and the employees of the port who have contributed to achieve this record. He also requested all the concerned to continue to improve the performance in future also.
 
 Berth IX is one of the bulk handling berths of the port equipped with conveyor belts enabling to move the coal to coal storage in port premises. Such volume handling comes as a breather for the port since many power plants around Tuticorin are not running to their optimum level, port sources say. tnn
