JAIPUR: The   (JDA) has once again sought time to submit claims against Sanjose Supreme Tollways Development Private Ltd before the settlement committee constituted to resolve   issue. 

 After submitting claims of Rs 7,043 crore in previous meeting, the JDA on Tuesday requested for more time to estimate revised claims. The JDA officials have not prepared the objection against the claims of Rs 600 crore submitted by the Sanjose Supreme. 
 
 The next meeting will be held on May 8.
 
 Sources in the department said, chief minister and urban development and housing (UDH) minister   came down heavily on JDA officials after hefty claims were calculated. The committee was constituted to resolve the dispute between JDA and company after the intervention of union minister  . 
 
 “In chief minister’s office, the JDC was summoned over the issue. Following this, the JDC pulled up the engineers associated with the project. The commissioner also issued suspension warning to engineers.”
 
 With the settlement issue taking time, the state government might be delayed in handing the work over to the   (NHAI).
 
 It was recently announced that the work of the project would be completed in 15 months. In June 2011, JDA had selected the joint venture of Sanjose Supreme as the final bidder for the Ring Road project. As per the contract, the awarded firm had to complete the work in 24 months. However, due to infighting in the company, the project was stalled till date. Now, the state government has set August 2018 as the new deadline for the project.
