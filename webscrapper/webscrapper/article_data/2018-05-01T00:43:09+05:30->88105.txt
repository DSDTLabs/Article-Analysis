New York: An Indian-origin woman and her grandparents died while two children were injured after a fast-moving blaze swept through their home in the US as they celebrated a relative’s upcoming wedding, a media report said. Harleen Maggo and her paternal grandparents Ragvir Kaur-Kainth, 82, and Pyara Kainth 87, died in the tragic incident on late Saturday.  Maggo’s two children, an 8-year-old girl and 6-year-old boy, were trapped inside the building as it burnt. Fire-fighters rescued both of them. While the girl was in critical condition and the boy was in stable condition at Nassau University Medical Center, fire officials said.  Seven other people inside the home were taken to local hospitals with serious but not life threatening injuries, New York City fire department deputy chief Michael Gala said in the report. A relative Ranjit Kaur, 38, said she heard screams of people still trapped in the house.  “’It’s a big tragedy,” Kaur said, adding, “I’ve never seen a big fire like this.” Fire officials are investigating the cause of the blaze and are still unsure where it started.
