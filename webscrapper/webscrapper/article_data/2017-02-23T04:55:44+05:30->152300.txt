VADODARA: The inquiry report that found professor   guilty of selling sculptures of master artists will not be tabled before the syndicate members in the meeting on Thursday even as the decision on taking disciplinary action against him has been left on their wisdom.

 A three-member inquiry committee had on Tuesday submitted the report holding   guilty of selling artworks to a city-based gallery owner without their knowledge. 
 
 Ahmed had sold the sculptures of veteran artists Dhruva Mistry, Jyoti Bhatt and late   to gallery owner Hitesh Rana.
 
 Sources said that the university administration has decided not to place the report during the meet as the members also have to discuss annual budget, accounts and annual report of the university during their meeting to set the ball rolling for the annual senate meeting that will be held next month. 
 
 While the committee has held him guilty, Ahmed too had earlier admitted in writing that he had sold off the sculptures at Rs 5 lakh to Rana. After the row, the sculptures have returned to the university.
