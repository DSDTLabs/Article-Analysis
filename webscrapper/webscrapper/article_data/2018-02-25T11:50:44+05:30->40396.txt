PANAJI: The performance of students in Goa tends to suffer as they rise to higher classes, says a suvey by the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT). The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017 was held in mathematics, science, languages, and social sciences. 

 Curiously, in Classes V and VIII, students in South Goa   appeared to perform significantly better than their north Goa counterparts, according to the survey.
 
  
  
 
 Based on data released earlier, it was widely believed that students in Goa as a whole tended to fare better in languages than in science and mathematics. But now, wider data indicates that Goa’s students do well in lower classes and their performance deteriorates in all subjects as they rise to higher classes.
 
 In environmental studies (or social science subjects), language, and mathematics, students of Class III surveyed in the NAS scored between 58% and 65% across the subjects. In Class V, students’ scores in the same subjects dropped to between 45% and 55%. But, in Class VIII, the scores in mathematics, science, and social sciences dropped to even as low as 31%. Only in languages did students continue to score consistently (between 50% and 62% in Class VIII too).
 
 While students of North Goa and South Goa performed almost the same in Class III, this changed significantly in higher classes. The disparity between students’ performance grew as students rose to Class VIII. Where North Goa students scored an average of 50% in language (English), their South Goa counterparts scored nearly 12% higher. In social sciences and science too, there was a difference of over 9% in the average marks scored by the students of Class VIII surveyed, with students from South Goa emerging better here too.
