NEW DELHI: The latest   has accused PWD of causing a loss of Rs 241.20 crore to the exchequer through poor planning of its projects and delays in completion of works. 

 The audit undertaken between 2011 and 2016 has questioned certain flagship projects of the current government—for example, the elevated corridor from Vikaspuri to Meera Bagh and   to Wazirabad—both of which, the government claimed, had been completed before time and for less than the original estimate. The CAG says that both stretches were delayed by over a year each and payments of Rs 12.21 crore could have been avoided.
 
 Government officials, who maintained that the report did not take into account several factors on ground, said that in the case of the elevated corridor, there was a stay by NGT for about 13 months over tree cutting, which delayed the project. “When the government is saying a project has been completed before time, it is talking about the actual time taken to complete the project. The stay by NGT pushed deadlines by more than a year. In the case of Mandoli prison, Delhi Police refused to take it over due to staff shortage. It could not have been finished without the prison facilities shifting there,” the official added.
 
 The CAG has also found that projects have been delayed due to lack of coordination between agencies. “Work (RTR flyover) was awarded in November 2014 at a tendered cost of Rs 278.08 crore with a completion target of November 26, 2016. However, only 6% of the work was completed in 19 months from start of work…work was delayed due to shifting of services. This indicates lack of timely intervention on part of PWD,” the report said.
 
 CAG has found that out of 40 works selected for audit, six were completed with a delay of 4-70 months while 15 projects were running delayed by 24 to 743 days.
