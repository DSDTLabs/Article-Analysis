 During the hearing of the public interest litigation, the petitioner's lawyer Norma Alvares argued that there is no clarity on who will ensure the safety of mines during the monsoon season. 
 
 The government replied that the leaseholders have been asked to ensure the safety of the mines.
 
 In its affidavit, chief secretary Dharmendra Sharma had earlier stated that the petitioner's demand that the safety operations should be looked after by the authorities "is not practicable".
 
 The department of mines and geology does not own heavy machinery required at more than 69 locations nor can procure such heavy machinery at short notice, the state government said.
 
 "The present arrangement proposed to be carried out through the concerned leaseholders is on the principles of right coupled with duty. 
 
 Secondly, it is also part of their corporate social responsibility to carry out necessary measures not only for the safety of the mines, but also for the welfare of the people residing in mining areas," the state government said in its reply to the high court.
