CHANDIGARH: The court of additional district and sessions judge J S Sidhu on Friday held   (BKI) Jagtar   guilty in the   assassination case. The quantum of sentence would be pronounced on Saturday.

 Tara had earlier confessed to his crime in a six-page confession letter which he had submitted to the court. On Friday, he urged the court to treat him like a “prisoner of war”, saying he was a Sikh nationalist fighting for the freedom of the occupied Sikh state.
  
 
 Earlier during the course of his trial, Tara had stated that it was Dilawar Singh, and not  , who was the mastermind in the conspiracy to kill then CM Beant Singh. His six-page confession letter had references from Gurbani and Sikh history. It also stated that Sikh history taught him not to accept injustice and that circumstances were intolerable when innocent youths were massacred and Beant Singh, after coming to power, did not punish the culprits. The letter also stated that he was not afraid of being called “rebel” or “anti-national” as his motive was right. 
 
 Tara had also alleged apathy on part of jail authorities and had asked for euthanasia.
 
 Beant Singh was assasinated by a suicide bomber outside the civil secretariat in Chandigarh on August 31, 1995. A   employee Dilawar Singh had acted as a human bomb. The police had taken nine accused into custody, out of which fate of eight has already been decided.
 
 The case took more than 25 years to conclude as Tara managed to escape from jail in January 2004 and was re-arrested from Thailand in 2015. Beant’s assassins — Paramjit Singh Bheora, Jagtar Singh Hawara and Jagtar Singh Tara, and Devi Singh, a murder convict in another case, had escaped from Burail jail on January 22, 2004, after digging a 94-foot long and 2.4-foot wide tunnel.
