Gurgaon: Industrial workers from different trade union bodies, including Citu and AITUC, staged a protest in the city on Thursday against the Centre’s   move, saying it has rendered a large number of their colleagues jobless. They alleged a number of companies have been using cash ban as an excuse to lay off workers and sought the district administration’s intervention. They also submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner.

 Close to 200 protesters assembled near Mini Secretariat late in the afternoon and subsequently took out a march around Old Railway Road amid heavy police deployment, blocking traffic in the area for some time. They also raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s sudden demonetisation move and demanded justice for their colleagues who have been laid off due to cash crunch.
 
 Workers told TOI many companies have sent their contractual employees on long leaves, while salary cheques have also bounced in a number of cases. “The workers in Gurgaon, Manesar, Dharuhera and Bawal have been affected by demonetisation. Our colleagues have been sent on long leaves and no one knows when will they be reinstated or get another job,” said Baldev Singh, state president of AITUC.
 
 “Their salaries have been deposited in their bank accounts. But it would take them some time to withdraw the money. Also not all workers have smart phones or access to Internet for digital payments. How are they supposed to manage their finances?” said Satvir Singh, member, CITU.
 
 The workers later met deputy commissioner Hardeep Singh and handed over a memorandum of their demands. Their demands included the reinstatement of sacked workers, particularly the contractual employees of Hero Motocorp Limited, who were recently sent on long leaves.
 
 When contacted, the deputy commissioner said, “The workers have raised some issues that they want us to resolve. We have taken note of their concerns and will see how the same can be resolved.”
