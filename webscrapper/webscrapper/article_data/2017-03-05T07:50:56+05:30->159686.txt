BATHINDA: Angry over a private bus hitting a couple on a motorbike, some villagers damaged three buses of Raj Transport Company, which run between   and Amritsar, near   on Saturday afternoon. Mandar Singh (45) of the village, along with his wife Jaswinder Kaur (42), was going towards Goniana town on a bike when a   bus PB 02 CC 5273 hit the bike from the rear. Both fell down from the bike and sustained serious injuries. They have been admitted at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot. 

 Only four days ago on February 28, a Hargobind transport company bus was involved in an accident in which Jaskaran Singh of Jaito village was killed when the baggage compartment door of the bus got opened. The victim was driving a car. 
 
 "The villagers on seeing the bus hit the couple ran towards them and helped them get up. They later took them to Goniana hospital from where both were referred to Faridkot. Meanwhile, some villagers made the bus stop and apprehended the driver. They damaged windowpanes of the bus and deflated the tyres. The villagers also damaged windowpanes of two more buses of the same company, which were plying on the same route. They also held a protest dharna," said eyewitnesses.
 
 Aklia resident Gurmukh Singh said that, "The bus driver tried to run away after hitting the couple instead of taking care of them. This angered the villagers and they held a protest and blocked the road. We want the transport company management to reach here and direct drivers to follow road traffic rules and respect other commuters." 
 
 Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma said that, "The administration was providing treatment to the couple, which is said to be out of danger. A case has been registered against bus driver Lakshman Singh of Amritsar and he has been arrested." He, however, added that the police would also probe the act of people damaging the buses.
