LUDHIANA: The reader of the additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-IV) was suspended on Monday after he allegedly ordered the investigating officer of a Jodhewal   case to arrest the accused.

 
  
 
 Tibba police station SHO inspector Daleep Bedi said the reader,  , was suspended after an inquiry.
 
 In the Jodhewal land fraud case, an FIR was lodged in January against three identified and some unidentified persons for trespassing.
 
 The police officer said after an inquiry into the trespassing allegations, the ADCP-IV had recommended addition of sections 420 (fraud) and 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) of the IPC to the FIR.
 
 He said the accused had filed an application with the commissioner of police that reader Tajinder Singh was neither a supervisor nor an investigator, then how could he order the investigating officer to arrest them.
 
 Sources in the police said the normal procedure was that after getting applications from the complainants, the senior officers ask their readers to call the investigating officers or the SHOs concerned for action. “A reader cannot call investigating officers or SHOs and ask them to act without the knowledge of his superior. The suspension is a warning to the reader and he will have to give an explanation,” said a police officer.
 
  He added that in this case, the investigating officer has also confirmed to the senior officer that the reader had called him up and asked him to arrest the accused in the land fraud case after two sections were added in the FIR. ADCP-IV Rajveer Singh said it could not be said that the reader misused his position, as the case was evidence-based. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP)   confirmed that reader Tajinder Singh has been suspended.
