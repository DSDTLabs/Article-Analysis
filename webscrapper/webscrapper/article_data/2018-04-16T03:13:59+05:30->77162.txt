NEW DELHI: PM  's ‘Bharat ki Baat, Sabke Saath’ public interaction in London will be held at the iconic  , an old Methodist church in central London, and is likely to be attended by around 1,500 people.

 
 The event, to be held at 5pm Wednesday, will be telecast live and Modi will respond to questions gathered through the NaMo app and “video selfies” sent in by questioners. There will be some questions from the audience and a moderator will manage the flow of events.
 
 The venue for the interaction is, according to its website, “steeped in history” as a meeting place since the early 1900s. It was where the first-ever meeting of the UN took place in 1946 and has hosted historical figures like Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King besides personalities like Winnie Mandela and Michael Gorbachev. It was the stage for Andrew Webber Lloyd’s first public performance in 1968.
 
 The event will see the PM answering questions, expected to be on politics, policy and social themes. The stage provides him an opportunity to showcase India on the global stage and also speak on contemporary issues, including recent attacks on the government and BJP over the Kathua and Unnao incidents as well as opposition’s charges of a “flat economy”.
 
 Given the trend of his recent speeches, Modi can be expected to argue that the BJP-led government has made a big difference in terms of the economy and welfare measures as compared to the situation he inherited from Congress.
