JAIPUR: Police investigation into the death of businesswoman  , owner of city-based multi-crore institutional group, has resumed with family members being quizzed.

 Shubhangana's husband  , meanwhile, has told police that his wife suffered mental agony as her parents wanted her to divorce him. 
 
 “My wife told me on several occasions that her parents wanted her to divorce me. She was unwilling to do so,“ he said. The parents of Shubhangana had filed an FIR at   police station, however, the case was handed over to crime branch for investigation. The crime branch began calling with witnesses and family members for the investigation. Shubhangana's father   had alleged that his daughter was killed by her husband Rajkumar. The father in his complaint said that it was a planned murder as Rajkumar was involved in several immoral and illegal activities.
 
 However, Rajkumar refuted allegations and said that he is been unfairly targeted, “Photos from my social media accounts were downloaded without my permission and leaked into media. These photos were captured in Thailand where I had gone with my family,“ he said. But the Suranas have been maintaining that their daughter died due to her husband.“The father said that his daughter had discovered about Rajkumar's illicit activities, and sent him WhatsApp message in which she poured her heart out, and voiced her distress. She was planning to take legal action against Rajkumar but he had got whiff of her plans,“ cops said.
 
 The police are currently scanning through the call detail records and other CCTV details of the area. “I am ready for the investigation, but I must be allowed to meet my children. This reeks of a conspiracy and it should be probed,“ Rajkumar said.
