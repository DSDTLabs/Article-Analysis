 "There is a little bit of wear and tear around the good length area and the spinners will exploit this as the game goes on. There will be some help for the bowlers bowling with the new ball. It will be full of runs, but mind you, it will be on the slower side. The team that wins the toss will bowl first and they will want to have the target on their mind" -
