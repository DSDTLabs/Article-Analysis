Thane: Four days after two men, including a pharmacist, we-re arrested with 6kg of  , a psychotropic drug, worth Rs 15 lakh, the police said the duo had been earlier arrested in similar cases. “Police records showed that   Amit Godbole was caught stealing nearly 50kg iodine from an Ambernath company, while Luvkush Yadav was arrested a cigarette theft case last year,” said a police officer. 

 “Godbole and Yadav are being interrogated and their involvement in other cases will be scrutinized,” said assistant inspector Amol Walzade. Godbole had given his licence to an Ambernath resident to run his pharmacy shop, said the police. In fact, he had renewed the licence on January 4. 
 
 After their arrest, Godbole and Yadav led the cops to the Ambernath unit of Centaur Pharmaceuticals from where 760kg of suspected contraband drugs worth Rs 19 crore were recovered from a hidden room. ANC and FDA officials are verifying if the seized drugs were licensed or not. “We are also checking if the production was in compliance with the rules,” said assistant police commissioner Bharat Shelke. The police will soon question the directors and management of Centaur Pharmaceuticals. — Nishikant Karlikar
