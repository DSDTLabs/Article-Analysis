ARA: A rickshaw puller has accused the staff of   of turning down his request for a stretcher to carry his   wife,  , to the   department of the hospital. A video clip showing the rickshaw puller, Anil Shah, dragging his wife to the OPD due to the alleged refusal of the   to provide him a stretcher had gone viral on Wednesday.
 
  Deputy superintendent of sadar hospital Satish Kumar Sinha has, however, refuted the allegation. “There is no scarcity of stretcher in the hospital. Shakuntla is a mentally challenged woman, who often tries to run away from the hospital. Her husband and others were probably trying to stop her when the video was shot. We have shifted her to Koelwar mental hospital for further treatment.”
