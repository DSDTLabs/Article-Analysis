BENGALURU: Marriages are made in heaven, they say. But this was one union that could have been made only on earth. For, the ones who tied the knot were defying many divides: caste to begin with and gender to end it all. The groom was a man from Magadi, the backwaters of Bengaluru, while the bride a transwoman who has made a name for herself as a tireless crusader for the third gender in the metropolis.

After their well-attended wedding reception here on Sunday night, Akkai told TOI that both the families coming together to arrange the marriage was the sweetest moment in their life. The groom, Vasu, is also an activist fighting for the rights of the LGBT community.
 
 The couple got married on January 20 in Bengaluru. For Akkai, it was a realization of love she had always cherished like any other human being. “My husband and I belong to different castes. I’m a transwoman who can’t bear a child, however, he was in love with me and determined to marry me. We told our parents about our decision and there was no word of opposition,” she said.
 
  “I don’t see her as a transwoman, I see her as a woman,” said Vasu. Though from a lower middle class family, Vasu said his family was more than accommodative. “Yes, I had to tell them what a transwoman was and how the community is. Later, I told them about Akkai and my wish to marry her. They gave me their blessings,” he said.
