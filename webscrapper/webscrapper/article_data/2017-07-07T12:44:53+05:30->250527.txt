If posters and the name itself are anything to go by,   is yet another movie that celebrates a few ‘bros,’ their ‘fraandship’ and associated adventures. It has five songs by  , which try to amp up the joyride and let’s see how they fare. 
The film’s first song that goes Dulquer, Nivin and Fahadh, sung by Ramshi, has some quirky lyrics that are the highlight. Worded to cater to the youth’s current heartthrob fixations and ideas of charm, since the picturisation is funny enough, it will have some takers. Ramshi’s singing style suits the number well and sounds a tad gracefully laidback and urban.
 The second song Kalynama has a bevy of singers —  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and  . It’s a song that reminds you of many compositions. For example, the chorus portion of nammude chekkante kalyanam colour aaneda has a striking resemblance to the Dostana song Desi Girl. The composition can’t claim anything innovative about it, but the sprightly pumped song can definitely get you swaying on the floors, if in the right company.
 The third song Chunkzz Chunkzz by Gopi Sunder has a fun intro and peppy chorus. It’s about chunkzz who has no girlfriends to have fun with. The chunk chunk chunk chunkzzz portion in particular has a pulsating feel. Some average ‘Manglish’ words in hep tones also infuse some punch into it.
 Next up is  , again by Ramshi. The track has some funny, breezy lyrics but pretty usual stuff. The rhythms have some beach-side, Goanness in them though.
 The final song Ithu Nava Sumasara by Divya sounds like a deliberately retro and sensuous song. It succeeds in transporting you to the heyday of this genre at times. Though the composition is average, Divya sings with gusto and keeps you hooked to the song till the end.
