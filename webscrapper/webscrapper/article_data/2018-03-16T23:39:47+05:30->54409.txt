Jana Sena Party (JSP) leader  , who promised to get the support of different parties in the country for the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government, stayed away from playing any such role on Friday.

 On February 19, 2018, Pawan Kalyan had dared YSRCP leader Jaganmohan Reddy to move a no-confidence motion against the Modi government and declared that he would be able to garner the support of 80 MPs of various parties to support it.
 
 A few days before that Jaganmohan Reddy had challenged both Pawan Kalyan and chief minister of Andhra Pradesh N Chandrababu Naidu to support the no-confidence motion. Though Naidu did not formally respond to that, on Friday, TDP MPs gave their consent in writing for the no-confidence motion. While this entire scene unfolded in Delhi with even the MIM from Telangana showing support for it, Pawan Kalyan was otherwise busy.
 
 The fact is that the Jana Sena Party (JSP) has no MP as it did not contest the 2014 polls.
