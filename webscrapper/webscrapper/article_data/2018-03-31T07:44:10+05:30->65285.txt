PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Municipal commissioner   on Friday said the civic body would explore the option of providing fire hydrants and other facilities at its garbage depot in Moshi to combat flames, after the fire was doused in the morning.

 “We cannot station a fire engine permanently at the depot because there is no fire station in its vicinity. But we are exploring the option of providing fire hydrants at the depot to combat fire in the future quickly,” said Hardikar.
 
 The   Corporation ( )’s lone garbage depot at Moshi is off   highway. A fire broke out there for the first time in 20 years on Thursday night. The flames were doused on Friday morning.
 
 “Prima facie it appears to be a natural fire and not man-made. It was very hot on Thursday and the fire probably broke out because of the high temperature. The windy weather hampered the firefighting operation. Still, we shall conduct an inquiry to find out the cause of the fire,” said Hardikar.
 
 Kiran Gawde, the fire officer of PCMC, said, “The fire brigade received a call around 8pm. Six fire engines reached the spot with water tankers for dousing the fire. One fire engine each of the Pune Municipal Corporation, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation and a private company had come to help on Thursday night. The fire was brought under control in the morning, but still smoke is emanating from some places.”
 
 Sanjay Kulkarni, the executive engineer of the PCMC’s environment department, said, “The fire spread rapidly because of plastic, fibre and thermocol. It was brought under control by 5am. We are spraying mud and water on the spots from where smoke is emanating.”
 
 Chandrakant Tapkir, a resident of Tapkirnagar, said, “People staying in areas close to the garbage depot faced breathing problems because of the smoke from the fire.”
