MUMBAI: Retired South African cricketer   and wife Melanie welcomed their second child in the city on Sunday, almost two years after their daughter India’s birth at a   hospital. 

 Jonty, who is the fielding coach of the IPL Mumbai Indians’ team, was in Hyderabad for his team’s finals.
 
 The South African fielding icon tweeted a few minutes after his son’s birth, “The prize before the prize @mipaltan? Nathan John “plunged” into the world on IPL final #poolbirth #earthmother #incredibleindia”. 
 
 Melanie delivered a boy at 6.09pm at   in Santacruz (W). Doctors at the hospital said both mother and baby were doing well. 
 
 “The Rhodes wrote to me a few months back about wanting a water birth for their second baby as well. Water birth isn’t easily available in South Africa,” said gynaecologist Dr Amit Dhurandar of Surya Hospital on Sunday. “Melanie came to the hospital around 4pm and had an uneventful water delivery at 6.09pm. The baby weighs 3.7kg.” 
 
 The Rhodes’ elder daughter, India, too had a water birth in April 2015. On April 23 this year, when Jonty took to Twitter to mark his daughter’s second birthday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had replied, “Happy birthday to India, from India.:)”
