LUCKNOW: Timely reaction by gateman averted an accident at Magarwara   crossing before Unnao station on Tuesday afternoon when a loader got stuck on tracks while the train was just 300 metres away. The train was stopped in time, following the alert by gateman. 

 Around 12.30 pm on Tuesday, a loader entered the level crossing even though the gateman gave the red signal to stop. The loader's front wheel got stuck in shifting tracks and broke down. The gateman alerted the control room and the train was stopped just 300 metres from the spot. It took hours to clear the track due to which 15 trains from Kanpur reached up to three hours late in Lucknow.
 
 Intercity Express (four hours), Ahmedabad-Lucknow Express (two hours), Shatabdi Express (one hour) and some passenger trains arrived behind their schedule. Shatabdi Express was delayed by 30 minutes while Triveni Express departed an hour late.
