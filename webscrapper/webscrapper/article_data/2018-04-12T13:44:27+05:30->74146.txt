UDHAGAMANDALAM: A portion of the footpaths on   has been encroached by big-time hotels. As the   department is in the process of re-laying road on 1.8km stretch of Commercial Road, activists have raised their voices to reclaim the encroached footpaths. 

 They say footpaths at a stretch of at least 300 meters of the road have been encroached. 
 
 Social activist and convener of INTACH (Nilgiris chapter)   told TOI: “The authorities of the state highways should take back the encroached areas on Commercial Road while relaying the footpaths. Within the town, pedestrians have all the right to walk freely.” 
 
 She said, “Ooty is a tourist place. And many elderly people visit the town. Irregular pattern of footpaths on the road will lead to accidents. Also, if encroachments are not removed, it will set example for others to encroach too.”
 
 Managing trustee of   (NEST) V Sivadas said, “Ooty as a tourist town had prominent footpaths in all the main roads. Over the years many of the footpaths were encroached. Officials have turned a blind eye to the issue.” 
 
 He said the stretch, where footpath is missing, consists of a few big-time hotels. It is nothing but violating the law. Officials should take stern action against the culprits and bring back the encroached footpaths to pedestrians.
 
 Murugan, assistant executive engineer, state highways-Ooty division told TOI, “We are relaying Commercial Road. Along with the road work, we are also repairing the footpaths. All the encroached footpaths falling under the state highways will be cleared soon.”
 
 According to the state highways official, the stretch of 1.8km road, starting from   to the main bus stand, is being re-laid.
