LUCKNOW: Those who have violated   or haven't complied with the approved map need to take note.   (LDA) would soon be taking action against all such buildings.

 To control rampant illegal construction across the city, LDA will be implementing sections 26, 27 and 28 of UP Housing and Urban Planning Act 1973 which mandate owners of illegal buildings to pay compounding fee for unauthorized construction or have LDA demolish the structure.
 
 To facilitate this, LDA has decided to rope in government consultancy firm -UPDESCO (UP Development Sy stems Corporation Ltd) to prepare a list of all existing illegal construction ever since LDA was constituted 43 years ago and issue them notices under the act.
 
 The agency will also pre pare a list of builders who flouted norms and sold units to people. These builders will be made to pay fines or their illegal construction would be bulldozed.
 
 LDA said compounding of map by payment of penalty is only allowed up to a limit and beyond that, the construction has to be demolished. LDA estimates that around 5.5 lakh properties exist within the ci ty limits, of which around 30% buildings have violated norms.
 
 Avanindra Singh, LDA's official in-charge of Regulation of Building Operations wing in   area said, “Section 28 of the act authorises LDA to remove illegal structures from the city upon any complaint or inspection.
 
 So we will take action against all those builders who have wrongfully built structures and duped people. They either pay penalty for the entire building and give us an undertaking to remove the illegal construction themselves or we will demolish it.“
