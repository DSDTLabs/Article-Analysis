Noida:   from Noida’s Dostpur Chaprauli and Mangroli villages have been protesting for over 60 days against alleged forced   of their   at Rs 118 per square metre under an urgency clause for development of industry.

 This land was acquired in 2013. The farmers have been protesting for cancellation of this acquisition as they claim their farming land has been used to build farm houses. They have taken their complaints to chief minister Yogi Adityanath through BJP MLA Dhirendra Singh.
 
 “The land was taken from us for constructing industries as it was taken at dirt cheap rates. Then we saw that the land was sold to people for building farm houses. We now demand an increase in compensation or absolute cancellation of the land acquisition for our land. Otherwise our protest and demonstration is going to be permanent,” Chaman Pradhan, who is leading the farmers’ protest, said.
 
 The protesters have been taking out processions for the past few months and have already taken their complaints and appeals to the Noida Authority. The issue was also presented by the farmers with the BJP MLA of Jewar, Dhirendra Singh. “We consider this unfair as all those farmers whose land was taken under the urgency clause should be at least adequately compensated because they have lost their farming land,” Singh said.
