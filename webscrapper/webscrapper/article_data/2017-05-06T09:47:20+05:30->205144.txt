HYDERABAD: A day after a BCom student   was arrested for killing 12-year-old Mohammed Uroojuddin, the victim's father appealed to Deputy Commissioner of police (South Zone) V Satyanarayana to carry out a fair investigation so as to ensure the accused gets the death penalty. 

 Mohammed Yawaruddin, the victim's father, said that if Munner was not punished he would end up committing similar offences. "When the dead body of my son was recovered from Milath Talab, it was beyond recognition and there was no clothes on my son's body. The police should should do justice to my family and conduct an investigation that will led to Munner getting the death penalty,''   said. 
 
 On Friday, Satyanarayana said that Munner had taken Uroojuddin for a drive up to Milath Talab on a two-wheeler on April 28. The accused, he said, wanted to kidnap the boy so that he could demand a ransom of 25-Rs 50 lakh. 
 
 "When the accused failed to gather the courage to make the telephone call, he throttled the victim to death. Later, the victim's clothes were removed and his body was set ablaze, before it was drowned into the Talab, which was filled with sewerage,''   said.
 
 A sodomy angle was prima facie ruled out by forensic doctors at the Osmania General Hospital after a post-mortem.
 
 Munner, who would not miss watching episodes of Crime Patrol, a crime-related serial was allegedly inspired by it while carrying out his plan. 
 
 Police personnel were able to unravel the plan after they came across   footage near a madarasa in  , which showed Munner travelling with the boy on a two-wheeler.
