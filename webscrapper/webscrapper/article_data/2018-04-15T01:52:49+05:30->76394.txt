NEW DELHI: A   plan went awry for siblings who were attacked by   in northeast Delhi’s Gokulpuri on Friday. Nineteen-year-old Prashant Soni and his three-month   sister Mohini were on a bike when the accused started to follow them. Soni tried his best to dodge the men, but they managed to flee with her bag.

 Soni made a PCR call informing the police about the   and said he had to rush her to the hospital as she fell off the bike and suffered injuries. A police team reached the hospital and a case was registered .
 
 Speaking to TOI, Soni said he picked up Mohini from her in-laws’ house and was heading to watch a movie when she noticed three men on a bike following them. “They were driving close and calling out to us. They then came to our left side. I even kicked them. But the pillion rider still managed to leap over and snatch my sister’s bag. When the person sitting in the middle came for her chain, she lost balance and fell in the middle of a busy road,” he said.
 
 Soni added that, “We were lucky that there was no vehicle behind, else the situation could have been worse. I asked a few passersby to pick up my sister and started chasing them, but in vain.” 
 
 Cops have formed a team to nab the accused and are scanning the CCTV footage to ascertain their identities.
