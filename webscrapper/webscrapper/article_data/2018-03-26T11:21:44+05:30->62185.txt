It was a fun-filled day in Ranchi with   processions out on the streets all over the capital. From exotic martial arts to the echoing chants of ' ', it was a grand spectacle on the city streets on Sunday. Lakhs of residents gathered on the streets to celebrate the birth of Lord Ram. Grand tableaus and huge flags were part of the processions. Vehicle entry to prominent streets , including MG Road, was blocked in the capital to ensure proper crowd management. Stalls along the road, set up by various social groups, offered fresh fruits and juices to the revellers who walked long distances as a part of the processions on the occasion.
