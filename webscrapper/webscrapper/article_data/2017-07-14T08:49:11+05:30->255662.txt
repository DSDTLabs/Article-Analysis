LUCKNOW:   has decided to start BSc (Hon) from the next academic session. The decision, taken on Thursday, follows this year's admissions in which the university received over three times more applications than the number of seats in both BA (Hons) and BCom (Hons). 

 "In view of the interest shown by students for BA and BCom honours, we will introduce BSc honours with 60 seats from the next session," said   SP Singh. Being more intensive and job-oriented, the courses are being preferred by students, he said. 
 
 LU had increased BCom (H) seats from 60 to 100 this year besides adding six more subjects in BA (H) with 60 seats each.
