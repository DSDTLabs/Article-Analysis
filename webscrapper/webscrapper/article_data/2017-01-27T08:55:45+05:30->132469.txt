HYDERABAD: In a rare achievement, an irrigation project constructed ahead of schedule will begin supplying water to nearly 60,000 acres of farmland in the state from January 31.The Bhakta Ramadasu Lift Irrigation Project was constructed within 11 months, two months before the deadline.

 Chief minister  , who laid the foundation stone for the project at Palair in   district on February 16 last year, will inaugurate it at a special ceremony on January 31. The scheme will provide water to the hitherto parched Tirumalayapalem, Kusumanchi, Nelakondapally, Mudigonda and   mandals under Palair assembly constituency and Dornakal mandal of   district.
 
 The lift irrigation project will draw 5.5 TMCft water from Nagarjuna Sagar Balancing Reservoir at Palair, which is at a height of 125.7 metres, and pump it to Sriram Sagar Project Stage II, which is at a height of 187 metres. The project was put through its paces during a trial run on January 23, when 300 cusecs of water was released into the canal system.
 
 One of the factors that helped in completing the project early was the government acquiring land as per provisions of GO No. 123, officials said. In all, 128.70 acres were acquired and compensation awarded to farmers immediately. The project also saw the utilization of unused pumps acquired for the   launched by the previous united AP government.
