RAJKOT: Poor condition of roads in Gondal town has claimed the life of a pregnant woman.

  (20), who stumbled on the road while trying to cross over a small pit last week, suffered severe injuries. As her condition deteriorated, she was taken to the Rajkot Civil Hospital. She succumbed on Thursday night after giving birth to a child. She was being taken to the hospital when the accident happened.
 
 The locals alleged that the construction of a new road is going on for the last three months in   on   road in Gondal. The road condition is so bad that no vehicle can enter Valmikivas. 
 
 An angry mob of locals decided to take her body to the municipality office, but as this news spread, executive president of the civic body   and other office-bearers reached her house and apologized for the road condition. They also assured that the work would be completed as soon as possible. 
 
 A local Dalit leader   said, “The municipality constructs roads overnight in other areas, but in   it is over three months that the road is still not completed.”
 
 Gondal deputy collector   said, “There are many water connections on this road and residents are not convinced to change the lines. This is reason behind the delay.”
