Apart from telling you that you look beautiful everyday,   can be used creatively at strategic points in the house to enhance the décor. Here are some ways to use them in a creative manner.

 
 Mirrors in the kitchen can attract grease and grime, so use them in a smart way. One way of doing this is by using an antique mirror with a smoky effect. Place them in such a way that they don’t attract unnecessary soot. 
 
 
 If you have an outdoor area, terrace or a big balcony you can use a clear mirror to make the space look much larger. Use mirrors with appropriate frames as per the theme of the outdoor area.
 
 According to vaastu and feng shui experts, mirrors placed in front of your sleeping area are a strict no, but with proper advice and creativity you can place them in areas other than these. Place them in such a way that they reflect light from the lampshade.
 
 
 Use lean mirrors instead of bulky ones for the bathroom area with shades like bronze, cinnamon and dark chocolate. You can also buy modern mirrors with chrome finish. 
 
 
 You can buy mirrored furniture like a chest of drawers or coffee table with mirrors on it. If you have a small roon, you can place them next to a wall and it will give an illusion of the floor extending beyond the wall.
 
 
 Take mirrors of different shapes and sizes and frame them. The frames can be ornate, antique, funky or anything that you like. Create a collection of these frames on the wall and they will look like artwork. Mirrors can also be used to lighten the look of your seating area if you have used vibrant paint on the wall.
