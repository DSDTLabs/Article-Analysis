LUCKNOW: Next time if a child is slapped at home or harassed at school, he or she can seek instant police help just by dialling four digits -1090.

 The popular 1090 Women Powerline, which has come to the rescue of several women in the state in recent years, will now have a dedicated cell for children. The cell will become operational next month.
 
 The cell will address problems being faced by children these days, like sexual harassment, bullying, ragging, domestic violence, and cyber-bullying. The idea for a dedicated cell for children was mooted by UP DGP Sulkhan Singh after the murder of an eightyear-old boy in   school, Gurugram, last week.
 
 On DGP's directive, we have roped in an NGO, Save The Children, for preparing the Standard Operating Pro cedure for setting up the cell, IG 1090  ,   told TOI.
 
 IG said experts working against harassment of children will hold counselling sessions in schools. They will first identify children facing harassment and then counsel them, Sekera added.He said there will be special focus on communicating with introvert children as many a time they don't share their problems.
 
 Experts will also address children's problems through letters and emails. The cell will cater to children across UP. Also, anyone who finds a child in distress can report the matter to 1090 helpline.
