Chandigarh : Two years after the murder of lawyer   alias Sippy Sidhu, his friends and family organized a   camp at a public park in Sector 27B on Wednesday. 

 Sippy was shot dead on September 20 2015, by unknown persons at the same park. More than 100 people donated blood at the camp organized by Sippy’s family. 
 
 More than 25 disabled sportspersons also also took part in the camp. Sippy’s brother Jippy said, “My brother always supported disabled sportspersons and used to get associated with several good causes. This is in his remembrance.”
 
 Jippy said they were unhappy with the way Chandigarh Police conducted the probe into Sippy’s murder. “Investigations had proved the involvement of a woman. However, the real findings never reached the public domain,” he said. 
 
 The family yet again demanded that the culprits be brought to book in the case. Sippy’s friend Rahul said they remembered him every day. “No one can imagine the pain of his family. It’s their courage that they are remembering him through this noble deed,” he said.
