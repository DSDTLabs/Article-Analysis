Actress   says she facetimes at least five times a week with her 'xXx: Return of  ' co-star  . 

  
  
 The Australian actress has struck up a close friendship with Diesel and knows she can always count on him for help and support.
 
 "I called him before I had the Ellen Show (a week ago). He's filled with advice...We   four to five times a week. Vin is one of the most unique, special people I've ever met. He's an endless abundance of love and sort of acceptance. And support that he just gives out to people," Rose said. 
 
 The 30-year-old actress said things got competitive on the set of the action movie as she and Diesel strove to see who could "bulk up the quickest". 
 
 "We trained very competitively to see who could bulk up the quickest ... we were training, training, training, and it got to the point were I couldn't bulk up anymore. 
 
 "His arms are the size of my head... I was like, 'This isn't fair anymore' and it got to the point where he could just lift me, like he was using me as the dumbbells and I was like, 'Alright show-off.'," she said.
