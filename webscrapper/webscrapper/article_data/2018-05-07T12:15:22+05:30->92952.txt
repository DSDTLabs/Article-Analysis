KOZHIKODE: Noted writer   has called for a targeted legislation to prevent cruelty against children practiced in the name of religious rituals. 

 Inaugurating a seminar against child abuse practised in the name of religious rituals organized by NISA-   and other organizations at the   here on Sunday, Anand said that democratic governments in the country were hesitant to act against cruel practices, including those amounting to child abuse, fearing it might ruffle public sentiments.
 
 The seminar was organized as an attempt to create public awareness against practices like circumcision and shoolam kuthu (piercing of a small spear through the cheeks or tongue of devotees including children). 
 
 He said that many cruel practices made their way into religions from the concept of blood sacrifice which many religions shared. He added that victims of such practices were mostly weaker sections like women, children and animals.
 
 A law like POCSO which is targeted and not open for interpretation can help to curb such practices, he said.
 
 "It is not just religious beliefs and rituals which are used to promote such practices. In USA, circumcision gained wide popularity after it was promoted as having medical benefits though it was later found untrue," Anand said.
 
 VP Zuhara, president of  , said that practices like shoolam kuthu and circumcision have no religious basis . "Inflicting wounds on the bodies of children as part of religious rites is a crime and a violation of children's rights," she added.
