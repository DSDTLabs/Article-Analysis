Kannan, 42, will join Uber, the most valuable startup in the world, from February 3 and will be responsible to grow Uber’s franchise in rising economies of Asia through strategic partnerships and investment opportunities.

 Incidentally, the Tata Group through Tata Opportunities Fund has an investment in Uber while the Group’s interim chairman Ratan Tata has a stake in Uber’s local rival Ola. Several Tata group companies —Tata Motors, Tata Capital Financial Services and Tata AIG — also have an arrangement to offer products and services at special rates to Uber’s drivers. “In fiscal 2016,   sold 30,000 cars to Uber’s drivers,” said Tata Motors president – passenger vehicles business unit Mayank Pareek.
 
 Kannan’s appointment at Uber strengthens the company’s top management in Asia. India is a key market for Uber especially after the company exited China last year. It has also aimed for a larger play in other Asian countries like Australia, Indonesia and Thailand. “His (Kannan’s) appointment reinforces our commitment to invest and grow our presence and unlock the full potential of ridesharing in this region (India and Asian emerging markets),” said Eric Alexander, president-Asia Pacific, Uber. 
 
 Kannan had resigned from Tata Sons last October immediately after the board replaced Mistry with Ratan Tata as its chairman. He subsequently helped Mistry in the shareholder battle against Ratan Tata. Before Tata Sons, Kannan was with Bombay Stock Exchange as its CEO. "Uber is one of the most dynamic and innovative organisations of my generation, and I look at this as a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with a group of highly talented and motivated people who are changing the face of global transportation," Kannan said.
