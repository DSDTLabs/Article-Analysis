NEW DELHI: Family members of 45-year-old Mugdha, who went   in the Saturday’s fire in  , have been waiting outside the   for nearly 24 hours now, pleading officials to allow them entry so that they can look for her.

 Her family members claimed Mugdha Devi was also an employee of the factory and had left home for work on Friday morning and is missing since then. However, a police official said that they did not find any other bodies in the debris.
 
 Devi’s sister-in-law, Rama Devi said that she had left home saying she would return the next day. “We were told that she worked at a paint factory in Bawana, but yesterday we learnt that they were made to stuff explosives into the cylinders and make fireworks for celebrations,” said Rama.
 
 The family has been sitting outside the F-block factory, pleading officials to have a final look for Devi’s body in the debris. 
 
 “Her husband lost his job a few months back and has been running to every official he knows to look for her. Both their son and daughter are mentally unstable,” she said. 
 
 The family stays at Metro Vihar in Begumpur and had shifted to Delhi a few years ago from Unnao, UP. “She had taken up the job after the supervisor had put up an advertisement for workers,” said Rama. Mugdha did not carry a mobile phone nor did any of her colleagues.
 
 “We don’t expect her to have escaped. But we wish that her body is recovered so we can give her an honourable farewell,” Rama said.
