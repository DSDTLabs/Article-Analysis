NEW DELHI: Vice-President   paid tribute to   on his death anniversary, but said he differed with him the country’s first Prime Minister on matter of religion and its importance in lives. 

 
 Naidu, who was speaking at the   in   on Monday, hailed the former PM’s push to science and technology as an integral part of national planning. 
 
 He however, stated that he had a different viewpoint, stating, “Scientific advances may illuminate our understanding of the universe. But it is the religion which provides answers to the unexplored universe. The issues of mind and soul and the relentless internal unrest and lack of internal peace constitutes this vast unexplored universe. It is religion which provides some answers to these raging issues.” 
 
 Naidu said Nehru’s outlook may make him “agnostic” and some may even call him an “atheist”. “While I pay my tributes to Nehru for promoting the cause of science and scientific spirit, I beg to differ with him in the matters of religion and it’s utility for humanity...I feel both science and religion are tools in the quest for prosperity and internal peace,”   added.
