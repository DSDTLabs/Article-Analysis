Music lovers were in for a treat on Wednesday night at an   session in a city coffee shop. A couple of musicians showcased their original music to the audience, and they seemed to lap it all up. From Country, Indie to guitar instumentals, the do had it all. Solo guitarist   started the 
proceedings playing a host of his originals which got the audience up on their feet. Up next was   who mesmerised everyone with his outlandish skill on the classical guitar.
