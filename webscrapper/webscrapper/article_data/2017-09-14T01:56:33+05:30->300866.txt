NEW DELHI: “I pressed the   button as I didn’t find any candidate worth voting for. None of them had anything new to offer,” said Sanjay Singh, a second-year student of Kirori Mal College.

 Singh isn’t the only one who is disillusioned with students’ politics on the campus: in fact, with a  , the None-of-the-Above option has made its presence clear in  . Only a couple of days ago, NOTA polled more votes than NSUI in   elections.
 
 Over 9,000 students went with NOTA for the post of DUSU joint secretary — against a total of 54,603 votes polled. Similarly, for the post of secretary, close to 8,000 pressed the NOTA button. Even for the president’s position, 5,162 voters found none of the 10 candidates suitable.
 
 The NOTA option was introduced last year in DU, giving students the option of exercising their franchise without voting for a candidate. Since then, more and more students have gone for this option. Last year, the post of secretary saw 12.6% of students going with NOTA.
 
 Shaurya Singh, a Hindu College student, said: “I am completely aloof from this electoral process. I was unaware about either the candidates or their agendas. It would have been unfair if I went for one particular party; so, I chose to press the NOTA button.”
 
 The biggest increase in NOTA vote share has been for the vice-presidential post — last year, it was 8.8%; this year, the number was as high as 14.1%. As many as 7,684 voters exercised the option for this post.
 
 The victors may be in a celebratory mode, “but isn’t it time for introspection for all political groups on the campus? They must ask themselves who actually has won this election — they or NOTA?” said Lipi Saikia, a student of Ramjas College.
