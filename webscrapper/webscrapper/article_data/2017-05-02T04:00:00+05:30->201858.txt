Vadodara: Upset with the management, hundreds of workers staged dharna outside the plant of General Motors in Halol on Monday. 

 The workers gathered at the spot and raised slogans against the state government as well. They alleged that their fair demands are being overlooked both by the company and the government. 
 
 The workers plan to sit on dharna outside the plant every day. 
 
 “Many of us have been working at this plant for years. The compensation that they are being given is very less. We are demanding more compensation amount as many workers are nearing 40 years of age and it is tough for them to find another job now,” said Bhavesh Jaiswal, vice president, General Motors Employees Union (GMEU). The company had earlier stated that it has given options of a ‘significantly enhanced separation package or continuity of employment at our Talegaon plant’. 
 
 The GMEU, however, alleged that the workers were promised adequate compensation but the management offered them only Rs 10 lakh. 
 
 “Some workers took home loans while working here. How will they pay EMIs now? The company must give more compensation,” Jaiswal said. 
 
 The workers’ union also vented out ire against chief minister Vijay Rupani. “We tried to meet him at least 15 times but the moment he learnt that workers from General Motors have come to meet him, he refused to meet. The government promotes Gujarat as an industrial state but so many workers lost job. Is this the Vibrant Gujarat they talk about?” questioned Jaiswal. 
 
 “The new firm that is to takeover this plant doesn’t want any present worker. Usually the companies that takeover another firms also hire the current workers. We will continue with our protests. At least, 50 persons will sit on dharna outside the plant daily. We will seek police permission for it,” Jaiswal told TOI. 
 
 General Motors had rolled out its last car from the Halol plant on April 28.
