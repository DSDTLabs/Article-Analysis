MUMBAI: The first half of IPL-10 has been strangely cruel to  . Even as the 30-year-old was leading the   to one thrilling win after another, the runs suddenly dried up. Coming off an injury which put him out of the game for nearly six months, the stylish India batsman repeatedly succumbed to googlies from leg-spinners while scratching around in the middle.

 The only time he truly fired was when he cracked a half-century against Pune at Wankhede, but even that knock was marred by his run-in with the umpire over a controversial wide, and his failure to take the team home.
 
 On Monday, though, the class act seemed to have finally put his miseries behind as he cracked an unbeaten 56 (37b, 6x4, 1x4) to guide his team through to a five-wicket win in a tense chase against the   at the Wankhede Stadium.
 
 Chasing 163, MI seemed on course even as they lost Parthiv Patel for a first-ball duck as Jos Buttler (33, 21b, 4x4, 1x6) and Nitish Rana (27, 28b, 4x4) added 61 in 44 balls for the second wicket. However, the habit of making a heavy weather of their chase came back to haunt them yet again as they slipped to 1305 in the 17th over.
 
 However, playing a captain's hand, Rohit added 35 in just 20 balls for the sixth wicket with Hardik Pandya (14 not out, 9b, 1x6) to take Mumbai to their eighth win in 10 games, ensuring them 16 points, enough to take them to the playoffs. Their captain's knock also helped MI pip the Kolkata Knight Riders to the top position on the points table. The beleaguered RCB, meanwhile, slipped to their eighth defeat in 11 games, and are in danger of enduring their worst-ever   season.
 
 True to their habit of making heavy weather of a target, MI needed 33 off 21 balls. Soon, they needed 30 off three overs, which became 18 off two after Hardik smashed the final ball off the 19th over from Aniket Chaudhary for a six to deep mid-wicket. Rohit, who joined the 4,000-run-club in the IPL, then showed why he is still one of the most attractive batsmen to watch as he swept a Sreenath Arvind delivery into the Sunil Gavaskar stand behind deep square leg for a six.
 
 He went on to complete a well-deserved fifty off 34 balls, and even as   threatened to spoil the party by conceding just four singles off his first four balls, leaving MI to get two off two, Rohit crashed the Australian all-rounder past mid off for a four to complete the job.
 
 Earlier, RCB looked like dishing out another forgettable batting performance when they slid to 1085 by the 14th over, before a 54-run partnership in 36 balls between Pawan Negi (35, 23b, 1x4, 3x6) and Kedar Jadhav (28, 22b, 2x4) took over. Kohli and AB de Villiers (43, 27b, 3x4, 3x6) were silenced just as they were about to boom.
