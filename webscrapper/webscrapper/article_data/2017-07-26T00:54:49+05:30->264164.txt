NAVI MUMBAI: The city’s   (DP) will be prepared by NMMC’s town planning department instead of earlier plans of outsourcing it. 

 The house members have sanctioned the civic administration’s proposal to prepare the draft plan using in-house expertise as against outsourcing the process to a private agency at the recent general body meeting. “With the house giving its approval, the administration need not be shelling out over Rs 2 crore for doing a job that could be easily done by our staff," said a town planning official. 
 
 The department has proposed that the plan will be prepared within a year's time.The proposal for preparing the plan in-house by NMMC was suggested by former civic chief, Tukaram Mundhe in September 2016. But the house remained unconvinced and had asked to retain the 2013 proposal of outsourcing the work. “At that time there was uncertainty in the proposal therefore the house didn't give its approval,but this time the administration was better prepared and therefore the proposal has been given the go ahead. If things go as per schedule, then Navi Mumbai won't be required to rely on development plan by   which was drafted in the 70s,” said
