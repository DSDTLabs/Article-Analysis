CHANDIGARH: Upping their ante against the   (CHB) for imposing penalties for carrying out modifications in their buildings, the owners of the dwelling units have decided to go on a hunger strike on March 4. 

 Over the years, city residents have been urging the administration to allow changes to meet the growing needs. The owners of Chandigarh Housing Board dwelling units have made changes in their properties in violation of norms, for which they are facing notices. 
 
 The board is imposing a penalty of Rs 100 per square feet for the changes made by the dwelling unit owners.
 
 To press the authorities to do away with the penalty, the residents will sit on one-day hunger strike on March 4. If the authorities fail to react, the residents have decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike from March 31. The Chandigarh Housing Board has developed house schemes in different sectors, including 29, 41, 40, 44, 43, 45, 47, 38 (west) and Modern Housing Complex, with around 64,000 units. The board has also developed rehabilitation housing schemes.
 
 Chandigarh Housing Board Residents' Federation secretary   said a majority of house owners have made changes as per their requirements, which need to be regularized. 
 
 "A large number of owners have been served notices. The administration should allow changes made within the plot area and storey-line," said Malhotra.
 
 To meet the demand of city residents allowing them to make changes in the buildings, the Chandigarh administration is in process of framing a need-based policy. 
 
  (MP)   has also been pressing the administration to frame a need-based policy and stop issuing violation notices till it is framed. The Chandigarh administration had allowed a few changes in the Chandigarh Building Rules (Urban), 2017, which were notified in July last year.
