PATNA: Parents of a   will soon be given Rs 2,000 as monetary incentive by the state government if they get their daughters covered under two-year immunisation circle.

 “Unlike ASHA workers who get incentives, there was no incentive for immunization programme in the state,” state immunization officer Dr N K Sinha said at a function to World Immunization Week on Friday. He added the state government was trying its best to meet the target of 90% immunization by December this year.
 
 Dr Birendra Kumar Singh, president, Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP),  , said only sustained and intensified vaccination programmes would eliminate deadly diseases like small pox and polio. 
 
 He said in 2014, the Centre launched Mission Indradhanush, followed by Intensified Mission Indradhanush in 2017 to reach out to all partially vaccinated and unvaccinated children and pregnant women in select districts across the country.
 
 Pneumonia and diarrhoea are the country’s leading killer infectious diseases that claim lives of children under the age of five. IAP health experts said according to a data released by the International Vaccine Access Centre in 2017, India can prevent over 90,000 child deaths and save over 1 billion USD per year by scaling up coverage of immunization programme against pneumonia and diarrhoea.
 
 Secretary of IAP Bihar chapter Dr Akhilesh Kumar said the inclusion of newer vaccines, such as the broad coverage pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, will help the country meet the United Nation’s sustainable development goals to reduce under-5 mortality rate by 2030.
