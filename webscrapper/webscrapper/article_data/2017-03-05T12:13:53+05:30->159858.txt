‘Deadpool’, released in 2016, entertained the audience by packing in profanity, sex and dark humour all in one movie. Now, the makers are back with the second part of the franchise, ‘Deadpool 2’. The new flick, set for release in 2018, once again stars   in the titular role.   posted a link to the trailer from his official   page. 
 
 The trailer itself doesn’t give away many clues on when fans can expect the sequel, with the final message reading: ‘Deadpool… coming … not soon enough’.
  
 In the trailer, we see Reynolds's character popping into a phone booth to get into costume...and (of course) pressing his butt cheeks against the glass. But by the time he's managed to change, the man he is aiming to help has already been brutally dispatched.
  
 There’s been a huge amount of pressure on the   sequel to be as funny as the first and thankfully, it seems to be measuring up.
