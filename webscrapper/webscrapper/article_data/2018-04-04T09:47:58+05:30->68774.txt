 Sarma was elected unopposed as BAI president for a four-year term during the annual general body meeting and elections in Calangute on Tuesday. 
 
 
 His first decision was to extend P Gopichand’s tenure as chief national coach for the next four years and allow   to continue as the junior national coach till 2022. Gopichand, credited with shaping a generation of Indian badminton stars, has been national coach since 2006.
 
 “Badminton has entered an important and interesting phase. We want to help our players in whatever way possible. We want to help the state associations and want to set up academies. We will now convene an executive committee meeting and come up with a vision document for the next four years,” said Sarma.
