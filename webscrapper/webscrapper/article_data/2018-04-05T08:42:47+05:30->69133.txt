AHMEDABAD: The academic council of the   has decided to do away with the   for   and bring back the annual term system instead.

 The university has stated that the late completion of the admission process makes it difficult to complete the syllabus and hold the semester examinations within allotted time. Officials in   said that the first meeting of the council, after the new members were appointed, decided that to have only one examination in the first year of the diploma courses after class X.
 
 Earlier there were two examinations, one in December and the second in May. Sources in the council said that the during the discussion it was stated that admissions to diploma courses offered in the university were grossly delayed primarily due to the semester system. This is because the results of class X board exams are usually out by June, while the admissions to GTU’s diploma courses are done in August or September with a delay of two to three months. This leaves much less time for the students to actually learn and appear for the first semester exams. Officials in GTU said that many students dropped the first semester or failed to clear it because of this. GTU vice-chancellor, Navin Sheth, said, “The academic council has cleared the proposal for scrapping semester system. There were several decisions taken by the academic council, but they have to be approved by the GTU board.”
