MUMBAI: The RBI's move to increase ATM withdrawal limits without improvement in   could lead to machines drying up sooner, fear ATM network operators. Also lobbying by banks to reduce the number of free transactions to three from five could lead to fewer transactions which will add to  ' losses.

 "We were hoping that in the absence of any breakthrough in discussions with banks on the issue of compensation of the costs incurred during the   period, the cap on ticket sizes would continue. A cap in ticket size results in more aggregate transactions per ATM per month. With the lifting of the caps, there will be an increase in the ticket sizes, and hence a reduction in the number of transactions," said Himanshu Pujara, MD, Euronet Services India - an ATM operator 
 
 He added that losses made by ATM operators range between Rs 330 crore to Rs 380 crore between November 2016 and January 2017.

Meanwhile, some banks who are net issuers (whose customers use their cards for withdrawal in other bank's ATMs) have lobbied with RBI to bring down the number of free transactions to three a month. The banks contend that higher frequency of transactions is hurting their balance sheet as they have to pay the ATM owning bank for every transaction.
