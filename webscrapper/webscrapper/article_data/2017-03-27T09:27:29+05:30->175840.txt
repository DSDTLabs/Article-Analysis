DHARAMSALA: The track at the   (HPCA) Stadium here has played the best this four-Test series between India and Australia has witnessed. Pacers have been rewarded for bending their backs, spinners have had appreciable turn on offer and batsmen can score if they dig in. But off spinner  , the hero of Day Two, believes batting last will be a tricky proposition.

 On Sunday, the second day of the series-deciding Test, it was Lyon who reaped the most benefits and brought the game on an even keel.
 
 Lyon returned figures of 4-67, restricting India to 248-6 and thereby keeping Australia ahead by 52 runs. And with the pitch still having something in it for bowlers of every ilk, the Australian believes batting last will be the most difficult.
 
 “It will be a big challenge for India, but it depends on how long we bat and how many runs we set them,” Lyon said later.
 
 He admitted that it will be challenging for the visitors as well to bat in their second innings. “It's going to be extremely hard but we have got good batsmen in our shed and I know they are up for the challenge.”
