JAIPUR: The   administration seems to have found a way to recruit personnel through the ‘backdoor’ again.

 Through a notification issued by the high court’s registrar general on December 15, 2016, the administration is regularizing existing contractual staff in the posts of senior system officer, system officer and system assistant.
 
 The notification has been issued after amending the Rajasthan High Court Staff Rules 2002 for appointing  . It reads: “The existing staff on contract basis shall be absorbed as a one-time arrangement”.
 
 The method of first appointing people as contract employees and then regularizing them has raised eyebrows before. A PIL questioning such ‘backdoor entry’ is already pending before the high court.
 
 Advocate   filed the PIL challenging the backdoor entry of employees in the high court in similar manner during 2009-2011. Most of the employees, who were then appointed, were relatives of court employees as there was no way by which ‘outsiders’ could find out about the vacancies. The PIL alleged that the process deprived opportunities of qualified people to participate in the selection process.
 
 The   judgment in Renu & others versus district and sessions judge, Tis Hazari, on the misuse of  , made it clear that “the chief justice cannot grant any relief to the employee of the high court in an irrational or arbitrary manner unless rules provide for such exceptional relief”.
 
 The Supreme Court added, “The order of the chief justice must make reference to the existence of such exceptional circumstances and the order must make it so clear that there had been an application of mind to those exceptional circumstances and such orders passed by the chief justice are justifiable.”
