The Indian   Experience, the first interactive musical museum, is finally ready to open its doors, with the first leg of the structure being unveiled this weekend. While the main   structure will take a tad more time to open, the  , the outdoor section with varied installations, will now be open to the public. The space has around 10 installations, which include a couple of Sound Strips and Sound Tables. 
Talking about the space,  , project director,  , says, “The idea behind having a Sound Garden was to have a preparatory experience for people, before they enter the museum. While the museum will showcase music as sound, this is our endeavour to showcase music as sound and create an interactive experience for all the people who visit us. Through different materials, we have created installations that will engage the people to understand sound and vibrations. While some of the installations like the humming stone are individual experiences, there are also ones for groups. For instance, one needs to place his or her head in the hole in the Humming Stone and hum, where at certain frequencies, one can hear and feel different vibrations. The Xylophone, on the other hand, is an installation that can work for both individuals and groups.”
 Manasi further explains that there was a lot of thought that went into the structures, which included ensuring that they can withstand all weather conditions and also aren’t made with any sharp edges and are child-friendly. Designer  , who implemented this concept along with Svaram, says, “The whole idea behind the Sound Garden was to create an immersive experience, where one gets to feel the notes and vibrations, while also ensuring that we put across the message that nature and music are inter-related and express it through installations.”
