Indore: After implementing door-to-door garbage collection system in all wards of the city, the civic body has decided to phase out traditional garbage collectors, commonly known as jagirdars. The jagirdars till now have been operating in most parts of the city. Speaking with TOI, IMC commissioner Manish Singh said that to make the new system successful, it was necessary to phase out the old one. “We have to develop the habit of disposing waste in segregated form. We also have to ensure the waste is not disposed anywhere else other than garbage collection vans,” Singh said. IMC officials said they were in touch with traditional garbage collectors and have asked them to work with the government machinery. “We do not want anyone to lose their income, we will need more people in the job and we have asked them to join us. Many of them have also assured co-operation. We will ask them to work for us and they will be paid accordingly. We have also faced opposition from many of them but I hope that they will understand that for the betterment of the city, this system has to be ended,” Singh said. Officials of the department said that while in many areas the jagirdari system still existed, garbage collectors usually do not collect waste in segregated forms. Many of them also do not throw the garbage in collection vans. They usually throw them in dustbins kept by IMC at various places or leave it out in the open. With the civic body also phasing out big dustbins, the existence of the system can lead to the problem of garbage disposal in the city. Some residents, especially those living in residential societies, have also complained that they were paying for garbage collection to both jagirdars and IMC.
