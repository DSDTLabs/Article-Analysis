New Delhi: Within 48 hours, the police have managed to identify the man whose body parts were found strewn along   in north Delhi on Friday. The  , Nitin, was a   and had been reported missing for two days.

 The victim’s hands and head were stuffed in a pillowcase and thrown in  . A leg was found 300 metres ahead and the second one 800 metres away. The sightings of the body parts ended after six kilometres where the torso lay on the side of the road.
 
 Nitin was last seen having a conversation with a man named Happy in a CCTV footage recovered by a special team formed by DCP Karin Narwal led by SHO OP Thakur. While looking for Happy, cops went to his friend Pawan Bhatia’s house. During the search, they found blood in his bed box. Bhatia was arrested on Monday, but Happy managed to flee.
 
 Bhatia told the police that his and Happy’s brothers had drowned in the Yamuna when they had gone to party on the banks with Nitin. Happy nursed a grudge against Nitin for two years as he suspected he had drowned his brother. He finally decided to avenge the “murder”.
 
 Last Thursday, Happy invited Nitin to a booze party at Bhatia’s house and got him drunk. He then slit Nitin’s neck using a saw.
 
 Happy then allegedly called his parents and Bhatia informing about his “mission being accomplished.” When Bhatia reached there, they cut Nitin’s body into six pieces and stuffed them in pillowcases. They then carried the body parts in a borrowed WagonR and scattered it along Ring Road so that cops would never be able to solve the case.
