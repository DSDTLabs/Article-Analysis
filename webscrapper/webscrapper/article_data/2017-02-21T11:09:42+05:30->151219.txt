Dubbing artist   expressed her rage towards the attackers, who assaulted the   by quoting that, the morons who did the heinous crime should be castrated than giving a capital punishment. She stated her comment while speaking at the protest meeting organized by film fraternity in Thiruvananthapuram on Monday.

 “We all are voicing for the safety and security of women in the society and it should not end with the protest meetings that have been organized at Ernakulum and Thiruvananthapuram. We should fight till an amendment is made in the law. We should not allow any man to even touch a woman's body,” says Bhagyalakshmi.
 
 Getting emotional she added that harsher punishment should be the answer for the attackers. “More than giving him a capital punishment by hanging him to death within few seconds, castrate these morons who dare to assault a woman. There is no right for a man to live in this world who makes brutal perverted actions against women in the society. I am saying this with a lot of pain. This fight should continue till the end. This is my request,” Bhagyalakshmi said.
