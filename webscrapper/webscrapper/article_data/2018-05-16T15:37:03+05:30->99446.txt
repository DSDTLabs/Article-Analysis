LUCKNOW: After tragedy struck PM  's Varanasi parliamentary constituency killing 19 people on Tuesday, office of chief minister Yogi Adityanath has taken serious note of the manner in which Rajan   was re-appointed MD of UP Bridge Corporation, which was handling the flyover project. 

 
  
  
 
 Mittal faced charges of corruption during his stint in the Akhilesh government and had been removed from the post of managing director, UP Bridge Corporation. Months after the   government took over, he managed to stage a dramatic comeback. UP government is already drawing flak for failure of PWD to make state roads pothole-free. This is another setback over mishandling of PWD, which is headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya.

Not only was Mittal reappointed, Maurya gave him additional charge of   and he is holding dual charge. Similarly, deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya is chairman of both corporations. It's principal secretary, PWD, who heads the posts. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 In February, Maurya removed then principal secretary, PWD, from the post of chairman of   and got himself anointed to the coveted post. Mittal is also being questioned within Bridge Corporation, not only for his comeback, but for appointing project managers in PM's constituency, who did not have adequate experience.
