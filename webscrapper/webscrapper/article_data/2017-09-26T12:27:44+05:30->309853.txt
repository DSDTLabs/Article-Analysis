In the latest episode of Kumkum  , Alia threztens Pragya (thinking she is Munni) with a knife but Pragya in return throws away the kniife and slaps Alia. And Pragya tries to calm Alia down by saying that she is on her side and that she should trust her. 

  Pragya explains how it is better for Alia to have   and   in front of her eyes rather that alone in a honeymoon suite. Pragya tells Alia that it will be easier for her to execute her plans when Purab and Disha are in Mehra house. 
 
  Tanu can sense that Pragya is turning clever and trying to turn the entire game in her favour. While Alia is pointing finger at Pragya, Abhi comes over and he asks them the reason for being in this room. 
 
  He asks Pragya to come and help him decorate Purab and Disha's room. Disha thanks Purab for giving her such a loving family. Pragya helps Avbhi decorate the room when he starts dreaming of their honeymoon. They share a lovely moment when Pragya loses her earring and then she panics thinking the family will think otherwise. Alia is lost in her thoughts thinking about ways of ruining Purab and Dishaâ€™s life and their first night. This is when she decides to kill Disha to get Purab forever.
