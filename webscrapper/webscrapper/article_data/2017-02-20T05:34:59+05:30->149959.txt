VADODARA: A group of old city residents led by   activists submitted a memorandum to the state-run   here on Sunday to register their protest against lack of medical staff at the hospital. 

 The RTI Vikas Manch had sought information about the total strength at the general hospital. The RTI application had revealed large-scale vacancies at the hospital, which is in the heart of the Walled City. 
 
 Against the sanctioned staff of 250 personnel, the hospital has just 162 staff members. Also, there are large-scale vacancies of medical officers, nurses and clerical staff. 
 
 “There are four posts of medical officers vacant while three class II and class III posts of medical officers at the dispensary are also vacant. Every time, we raise the issue, we are given hollow promises that the staff strength will be increased,” said social worker  , member of RTI Vikas Manch, who along with others submitted the memorandum. 
 
 According to group members, whenever an emergency case reaches Jamnabai General Hospital, the hospital authorities, instead of handling the emergency, refer such cases to SSG Hospital. 
 
 “There are no doctors available for poor patients who are dependent on this   as they cannot afford treatment at private clinics. The few doctors posted at the hospital are either on leave or busy attending programmes,” he said. 
 
 While patients are made to run from pillar to post, even registration of cases takes at least half an hour, they said, adding that even senior citizens are made to stand in long queues.
