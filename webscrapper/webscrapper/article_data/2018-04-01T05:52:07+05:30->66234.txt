AHMEDABAD: Students of   (Commerce) Central Board for Secondary Education ( ) protested against the decision of the board to conduct a   of economics paper.

 The CBSE had on Friday declared that the retest for maths paper of class X will be held only in Delhi and Haryana while the re-examination for economics paper of class XII will be held across the country. The class XII students demanded that like class X, the retest should be held only in areas where the paper had been leaked.
 
 Rutvik Anada, a student, said, “We have appeared in the examination after working hard for one year. Why is the board penalizing students across the country for its fault? The board failed to maintain secrecy and now it is victimizing the students,” he added.
 
 Ojas Singh, another student, said, “Economics is a tough subject and we gave our best in the examination. Now, we will not be able to perform with the same zeal in the retest. Tuition teachers are also not willing to conduct more classes for the remaining period.”
 
 The students also complained that there would be Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) and other competitive examinations in the last week of April and they will be hard put to prepare for both the CBSE re-examination and competitive tests.
 
 Varun Sharma, a class XII Commerce student said “The retest will put additional burden on the students. If the board could decide not to hold retest for class X students, then it could have taken the same decision for those in class XII board exams. We will be penalized for fault of government machinery. Students will have much less enthusiasm in preparing for a retest as they are already in vacation mode.”
