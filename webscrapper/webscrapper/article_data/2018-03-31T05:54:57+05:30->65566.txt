KOLKATA: Keeping in mind the bitter experience two years ago, in which two primary section students of   in   died of dengue, the school authorities have decided to make alterations in the school uniform for girls this year. In a notice issued to guardians on Thursday, the school asked parents to send in their daughters in grey trousers instead of the usual grey skirt.

 “The girls were wearing track pants with their shirts to avoid mosquito bites, but as this is their PT dress, it was inconvenient for them to wear them regularly. The decision to replace skirts with trousers has been taken as part of our continuous effort to protect our students from mosquito bites,” said school principal  .
 
 
 The principal added that the school authorities were taking other precautions, including spraying larvicide.
 
 Most of the guardians welcomed the move. “I am very happy with this decision. Apart from the dengue scare from mosquito bites, wearing trousers is also more convenient for girls in several other ways. This is a very positive decision by the school authorities,” said Manideepa Hait, whose daughter is in Class-VII girl.
 
 In August 2016, there was a massive furore among guardians after two primary section students died of dengue. The parents staged consecutive agitations and protested that the school authorities had failed to take any mosquito control measure. Classes had been suspended for about two weeks following the agitation as officials of the   made several inspections and found mosquito larvae on the school premises.
