NEW DELHI: The strategy of   to form an alliance with the Samajwadi Party to win Uttar Pradesh has not worked out. As counting is underway across the state, the SP-Congress combine is leading on around 70 seats while the saffron wave has registered leads on over 300 seats in the state Assembly.

 Even in Amethi, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi's Lok Sabha seat, BJP's Garima Singh is forging ahead.
 
 While the Congress said the "loss" will be assessed, it defended party leadership saying it should not be judged over a short span. "Yes, UP is a bad loss, it hurts ... I agree that, in UP, we need fundamental restructuring thinking for the Congress as a whole. These have to be hard, tough decisions about strategy," Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.
 
 Congress leader Shakeel Ahmad said that the politically crucial state was lost to 'public mood', he stressed that the gains made in Punjab and Goa should not be ignored.
 
 The BJP, which had just 47 seats in the outgoing Assembly, garnered 40 per cent vote share, in the most riveting contest seen as a gamechanger and a virtual referendum on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popularity and demonetisation.
 
 The nascent SP-Congress coalition was ahead in 69 seats while Mayawati's party BSP put up a poor show leading only in 17 places. The SP, whose campaign was spearheaded by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on development agenda, led in 58 seats.
 
 With this performance, BJP is looking at getting back Uttar Pradesh after 14 years.
