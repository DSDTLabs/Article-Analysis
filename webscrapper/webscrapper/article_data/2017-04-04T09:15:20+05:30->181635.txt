AMARAVATI: Chief minister  , who has always batted for a  , has now ventured to create an exclusive happiness index (HI) department. He is the second CM in the country, after his Madhya Pradesh counterpart  , to create and head the HI wing.

 A senior CMO official said the chief minister divested some of the key portfolios from his kitty to create and lead the new department. Naidu on Monday appointed new ministers to head energy, industries, commerce and tourism departments which he had been managing for the past 34 months.
 
 “No government can be rated as successful or achieve desired results unless happiness prevails in society. We have to work towards achieving the dream goal of making AP a happy state,“ CM is often quoted saying in his meetings.
 
 Naidu recently launched a campaign on “achieving happiness“ in society. Following his instructions, the urban civic bodies started organising weekly dance and song jamborees under the 'Happy Sunday' programme.
 
 In fact, the government's Vision-2029 document took inspiration from Bhutan's gross national happiness index (GNHI), encompassing nine domains like psychological well-being, health, time use, education, cultural diversity and resilience, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity and resilience, living standards.
 
 “We have also set parameters for HI. The idea is to see that each family gets Rs 10,000 income and HI will be measured from data sourced from periodic surveys in districts,“ C Kutumba Rao, vice-chairman of the planning department, told TOI. “We are devising plans and coordinating with other departments to achieve the target monthly income of Rs 10,000 for each family,“ he added.
 
 Key performance indicators have been designed by the planning department at the village level for the officials to monitor the work and achieve HI.
