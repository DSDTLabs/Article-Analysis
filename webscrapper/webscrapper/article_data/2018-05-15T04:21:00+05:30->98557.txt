Ahmedabad: Flight operations at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in the city were affected by bad weather conditions in Delhi and northern parts of the country on Monday. In the early hours of Monday, two Delhi-bound flights from Ahmedabad were cancelled, including one a 5.05am IndiGo flight and a 9.30am GoAir flight. One 4.45pm GoAir flight from Delhi to Ahmedabad was also cancelled due to bad weather. Besides these, three other flights from Delhi to Ahmedabad and two flights from Ahmedabad to Delhi were delayed by about an hour on Monday. Sources said operations are slowly getting back on track but aircraft are facing a lot of turbulence due to bad weather en route. As a little deviation in course is now possible, operations are slowly getting back to normal.
