MARGAO: The inefficiency of the   management plan of the   district administration came to the fore following the shoddy response of the authorities to emergency situations brought about by the spell of thunderstorm and heavy rains for last two consecutive nights.

 With the South Goa district administration setting up control rooms only during the monsoon period, questions are being raised among stakeholders about the preparedness of the district disaster management authority during non-monsoon period.
 
 “There is a serious need for a control room to be manned by persons trained in disaster management 24x7, 365 days a year. In the absence of a control room, people are left confused about whom to contact for rescue, restoration and relief works. The absence of an Incident Command System (the standardized hierarchical structure designed to aid in the management of resources during disaster incidents) only leads to delayed and shoddy response to disasters. A disaster management plan should not be buried in a heap of files or lie in some obscure shelf of an office; it should be triggered the moment a disaster is likely to strike. Sadly, reviews of disaster management plans are hardly conducted, and thus its limitations never get adequately addressed,” a source well conversant with the disaster management affairs of the state government told TOI.
