SURAT: Amid claims by Navsari MP C R Paatil that Surat airport is likely to get   notified status for international flight operations within a week’s time, the   ( ) has made it clear that certain requirements are still pending for clearance with the   ( ). 

 A member of ‘We Work For A Working Airport at Surat’ (WWWAS) posted a query on Air Sewa portal on the delay by customs department to notify Surat as customs airport. 
 
 In a reply on April 13, the customs department stated that a note has been sent on requirement needed before notifying Surat as customs airport to the ministry of civil aviation with a copy to AAI for taking action. However, the action taken report by AAI is still awaited. 
 
 “We are not doubting the words of Paatil that Surat will get a customs notified status by next week. But it is clear from the reply of customs department that AAI is yet to fulfill the requirement for customs clearance at the airport. We have been hearing about customs notified airport status for the last one year, but nothing has been done until now,” WWWAS member said. 
 
 Paatil had at a press conference last week stated that a representation was made to the ministry of civil aviation and AAI regarding limited international operations from Surat airport. tnn
