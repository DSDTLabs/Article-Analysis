RANCHI: Members of several tribal communities gathered in thousands at Ranchi's Alberta Ekka chowk on Thursday evening to voice their discontent against the amendments made in the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and   (SPT) Acts by the Raghubar Das government. 

 Sarhul, the tribal festival dedicated to mother nature, became a platform for members who took out colourful processions with booming music. The crowd protested loudly demanding the repeal of the amendments. 
 
 The revellers, cutting across age and gender, shouted in chorus "CNT-SPT sanshodhan wapas lo (Roll back the amendments to the CNT and SPT Acts)". "The Das government has tried to snatch away our basic rights by preparing a way to usurp our land. This will not be tolerated,"  , a septuagenarian member of the procession, said. 
 
 However, the Sarhul celebrations continued nonetheless. The early morning offerings followed by the ceremonious sacrifice by tribal priests or Pahans, gave way to elaborate processions. Tableaux from various parts of Ranchi converged at Albert Ekka chowk and police kept a watch with the help of drone cameras and over 2,500 personnel to avert any law and order problem. Pahans also predicted more than sufficient rainfall across the state during monsoon this year. 
 
 The political pleasantness on the other hand was not exchanged this time, unlike 2016. No front line leaders from the ruling BJP-AJSU Party graced the biggest Sarhul gathering here. 
 
 Last year, chief minister Raghubar Das and leader of opposition   shared the dais and participated in the festival together. But this time, both the political heavyweights dug their heels in   as the run-up to the Littipara assembly bypoll intensified. 
 
 "The discontent among the people against Das government's anti-tribal policies in recent months is very clear," Congress leader and former Union minister   said.
