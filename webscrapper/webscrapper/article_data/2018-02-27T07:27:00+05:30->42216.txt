CHANDIGARH: The   has expressed its unwillingness before the   and   high court in taking over the investigation of   murder case. The agency claimed that it is already burdened with work and that   are well-equipped to handle the investigation in such cases.

 These submissions were made by the premier agency before a division bench of HC in response to an appeal filed by Junaid’s father  . He has been seeking CBI probe into the death of Junaid, who was stabbed to death on a train in June 2017.
 
 “The state of Haryana is well equipped and has the requisite resources at its command to conduct investigation of the case properly under supervision of senior officers. The case has in fact been charge-sheeted by Haryana Police with six accused having been arrested, out of which two are still in custody. After investigation, the local police filed a chargesheet on August 22, 2017 and charges have been framed against the accused on October 11, 2017. The proceedings of trial are at the stage of prosecuti-on evidence and 15 prime witnesses have already been examined,” the CBI stated in its reply.
 
 Counsel for   also submitted that the agency was already burde-ned with the work and the case did not fall within the ambit of guidelines given by the   for CBI probe of cases.
 
 A single bench of the HC had already dismissed Jalalundin’s plea for CBI probe into the case after which Jalalundin had filed an appeal submitting that Junaid’s killing was “motivated by deep rooted communal hatred against victim’s community”.
 
 It has also been argued by him that maximum artistry and manipulation was done by the state police to weaken the statements of witnesses on the point of identity of various accused and their roles. Hearing the appeal, a division bench on December 5, 2017 had stayed the trial proceedings of the case and asked the CBI to respond on the issue. Junaid, 16, was stabbed to death on board a Mathura-bound train after an argument over a seat.
