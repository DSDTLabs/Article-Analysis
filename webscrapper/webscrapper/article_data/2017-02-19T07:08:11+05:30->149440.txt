PUNE: The   (PCB) had approved a nearly Rs 45 crore-plan to build two multilevel car parks on the busy MG   locale a couple of weeks ago. However, the board is now contemplating a build-operate-transfer (BOT) model owing to the high costs due to delays.

 “We have identified land for both the multilevel car parks. One has been planned on East Street, opposite   restaurant, and the other has been planned on Lloyd Road. The consultant’s drawings have also been approved. The final approval depends on the cost of each car park. For the Lloyd Road car park, we need an approval from the   chief, as the project cost is lesser, and funds are already available from the Smart Cantonments project,” said a senior PCB official.
 
 But for the costlier East Street project, while the board says it can possibly execute the project with funds from the ministry of defence under capital assets, it adds that the BOT model is being actively looked at, along with utilizing the complex commercially.
 
 The East Street car park is estimated to cost around Rs 26 crore, while the Lloyd Road facility will cost around Rs 17 crore.
 
 The board is expected to finalize if it will take the BOT route by April.
