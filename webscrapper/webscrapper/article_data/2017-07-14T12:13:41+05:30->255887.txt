SURAT: Employees of GVK EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute)-108 services went on a flash strike in Surat on Thursday. But for a few, all 37 ambulances of GVK EMRI-108 services were off the road, causing a lot of hardships to patients. People were forced to hire private transport to take their sick relatives to hospitals compelling the management to warn the agitating employees that they could face action under Essential Services Maintenance Act. People from nearby villages who could not afford autorickshaws even brought their ill relatives on handcarts to   (NCH).

 The employees, who had gone on strike on May 25 also to demand wage hike and better working conditions among other things, charged the management of being dictatorial.  , who is GVK EMRI employee, said, “The management had reached an agreement with us a month ago that it will not transfer our colleagues from here. However, the management has transferred some staffers to Kutch, Ahmedabad and Saurashtra. The management has terminated people who refused to be transferred out. We want all those dismissed in the past 45 days be taken back.”
 
 Satish Patel, GVK EMRI- 108 services chief in Gujarat, said, “This is no way to work in essential services. We will ask the authorities to invoke ESMA against GVK EMRI employees. If this happens, all of these people could lose their jobs.” 
 
 In Surat, around 160 staffers are working for GVK EMRI- 108 services. Surat has 37 ambulances and each vehicle gets at least 10 calls in a day. However, over 80% calls could not be attended to on Thursday. Meanwhile, some employees from Surat have gone to Mehsana as the staffers there are also on strike.
