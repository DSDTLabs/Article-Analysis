Pune: The Pune rural police on Thursday said they would go for Samasta Hindu Aghadi leader Milind Ekbote’s custodial interrogation rather than summoning him for questioning during the period of interim protection granted to him by the Supreme Court till February 20.

 Superintendent of Pune rural police Suvez Haque told TOI, “We will oppose Ekbote’s special leave petition on the next date in the Supreme Court (SC). We want his custody in the case for thorough investigation.”
 
 Another rural police officer, who did not wish to be named, said, “We have not issued any summons to Ekbote, nor have asked him to appear before the investigating officer in view of the impending hearing in the SC.”
 
 The SC, while granting an interim anticipatory bail to Ekbote on Wednesday, subjected the relief to certain conditions, including his presence before the investigating officer as and when summoned for questioning.
 
 Ekbote is wanted in connection with the January 1 violence at Koregaon Bhima, where a large number of Dalits had gathered to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the British-Peshwa war on January 1, 1818. The rural police are searching Ekbote ever since an FIR was registered against him and Sambhaji Bhide, popular as Bhide Guruji, at Shikrapur police station for inciting their volunteers to commit the violence.
 
 Ekbote has gone untraceable ever since his attempts to secure anticipatory bail from the trial court in Pune and later from the high court failed. On Tuesday, the trial court had directed a non-bailable arrest warrant against him.
