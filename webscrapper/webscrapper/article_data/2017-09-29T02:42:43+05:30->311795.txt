New Delhi: A   that fell in a   in northwest Delhi’s   on Thursday afternoon was safely rescued by five policemen.

 Police said that they received a call about the nilgai falling into the well around 12.30pm. Soon after, they rushed a team to the spot and the   operation was taken up. Locals helped the policemen in pulling out the animal in less than half an hour after the call was made. 
 
 One of the policemen went inside the 30-foot-deep well with a rope tied to his waist, while the others held on to the rope outside. The policeman caught hold of the nilgai, after which both of them were pulled out safely.
 
 Experts said the animal may have come from a nearby forest patch in search of food or better habitat. “Such instances are happening more often as there are no proper green corridors for these animals to move. Nilgai often venture out in search of better habitat and grazing material as most of these forests don’t provide sufficient material to graze on,” said Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in charge,  . He added that these animals need more green corridors.
