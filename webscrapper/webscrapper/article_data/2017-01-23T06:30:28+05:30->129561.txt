HYDERABAD: Making it clear that the prolonged illness of a relative is no ground to extend the parole of a convict, the   dismissed the appeal of   who is serving a life sentence in   for   of  . 

 The bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akthar upheld the order of the single judge who refused to grant any relief to Irfan and directed him to surrender before the jail superintendent as his one-month parole ended over a year ago. Citing a representation he submitted to the state for extension of parole on the ground that his wife was suffering from cancer, he approached the high court challenging the inaction of the authorities in taking a decision on his representation.
 
 The bench citing prison rules told the counsel for Irfan that authorities had power to grant parole to convicts only for a period of one month. "Only in exceptional circumstances, the state is empowered to grant extension of parole to convicts. But the illness of a relative is not sufficient to meet that exceptional criterion. Parole is a matter of discretion. You are sentenced to life. You are required to stay behind bars," the bench told the life convict. "Remission of sentence cannot be given to a person who killed a public servant on duty," it said. This is a case where a wakf board officer was called to a place at night and was killed in a planned manner, it added. 
 
 Agreeing with by H Venugopal, Telangana state counsel for home department, that the grounds urged by the convict did not fall under purview of the exceptional circumstances, the bench dismissed the plea.
