HYDERABAD: Conveying to the court their 'retreat decision' on the controversial questionnaire circular seeking certain very private information from citizens suspected to have a background of being involved in criminal cases, DGP Mahendar   on Monday told the Hyderabad High Court that they have informed all their officials and men all over the state not to use this circular anymore. The circular described those with criminal background as professional and repeat offenders and sought queries, including names of concubines. 

 "That circular is no more in existence. It ceased to be in force," Advocate General D   told Justice AV  , who was hearing two pleas that challenged police action and the legal validity of the circular memo. The judge took on record the statement made on behalf of the government that the circular issued for conducting survey of the offenders has 'ceased to operate'. It was issued on January 3 for a one-day survey on January 18. It was closed on February 7, the DGP's memo filed in the court says. The judge turned critical towards police for certain questions in the questionnaire. They were seeking details of our alleged concubines, names of advocates and pawn brokers, among others, said   of TDP BC Cell's Hyd unit and Abdul Hafeez, Kalvakurthy.
 
 When the judge said that he was closing the two cases because the memo was not in existence, one of the advocates of the petitioners expressed apprehensions about the possible misuse of data. The   objected to this and said that the circular will not be used again. The judge told the petitioners that they were free to come to court again if they find any misuse of their personal information.
