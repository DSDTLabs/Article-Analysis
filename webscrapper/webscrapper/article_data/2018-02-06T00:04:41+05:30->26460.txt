Regional joint directors were also part of the discussion. 
 
 Last Tuesday, a group of sword-wielding students of   attacked students from   at Pattaravakam railway station near Ambattur.

 While three students were dismissed from Pachaiyappa’s College, one student was suspended from Presidency   in connection with the October incident.
 
 The higher education department is also consulting government railway police as student ‘gang wars’ have moved away from campuses and MTC buses to suburban railway stations where security is weak.
 
 S Kaliraj, principal of Pachaiyappa’s College, said professors have been assigned 15 students each to mentor beyond class hours. “Many of the students hail from economically weak families and stay in the outskirts,” he said, adding that most of these conflicts grew out of personal rivalry. “And they masquerade this as ‘route wars’ and attack students,” he said. The administration is planning to provide free breakfast for those involved in sports to get more students to engage in extracurricular activities.
 
 Both principals also informed the secretary that the police frequently visited their campuses to counsel students. Police say Nemmilichery, Korukkupet and Hindu College railway stations are where clashes between students happen often.
