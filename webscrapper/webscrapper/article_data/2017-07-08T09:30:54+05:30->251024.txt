AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court (HC) was annoyed at SSG Hospital, Vadodara for preaching law to the HC instead of providing a medical opinion on whether it is possible to terminate the   of a 19-year-old   from Godhra.

 Justice A J   directed the state government’s health secretary to appoint a team of medical experts to examine the pregnant girl and to certify if terminating the pregnancy would cause any danger to the girl’s life? 
 
 The hospital authority told the HC that the rape survivor is carrying a 27-week pregnancy, and according to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, it is not advisable to abort a foetus beyond 20 weeks.
 
 Justice Desai said, “Instead of taking such things in its true spirit, the usual practice has been adopted by the gynaecologist and civil surgeon of SSG Hospital. Several orders passed by the   permitting termination of pregnancy beyond the period provided for in the MTP Act, 1971 in certain cases have been produced before this court.”
