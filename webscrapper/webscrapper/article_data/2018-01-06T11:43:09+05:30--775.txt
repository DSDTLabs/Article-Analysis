KOLLAM: Chief minister   said here on Friday that he was grossly misreported while referring to   during a speech in Kozhikode.

 He said that while he did not compare countries on the depth of their respective stands taken against the imperialist aggression by the  , a section of the media twisted and misreported what he had stated. “The particular media spread the canard that I said that while China was not doing anything strong enough to counter the aggression unleashed by the United States, North   was daring it single-handedly”.
 
 There was no such comparison, he reiterated. Pinarayi Vijayan said that he had only analyzed the stands taken by some countries against the United State and not compared the stand taken by these countries. But the reporter of a national media who was not familiar with the facts misreported him and that misreporting was followed up some others too. “I just mentioned this to highlight an instance of irresponsible reporting,” he said.
