NEW DELHI: Two men were arrested for running a fake   lab in northwest Delhi’s  . They had conducted over 23,000 fake tests last year. They would furnish fake reports of the samples given by patients. The accused, Ajay Yadav (31) and Sanjay Yadav (24), are residents of Jaunpur, UP.

 On April 14, police received a call from a person claiming to be a   official stating that Sanjay Yadav has been abducted. After verification, it was found that the call was made by Sanjay himself as he had cheated someone and wanted to be reported missing. However, his antic resulted in his fake path lab getting busted.
 
 A probe revealed that samples were brought to the fake lab through courier services from other laboratories in Delhi and other states without verifying its authenticity. The lab’s condition was found pathetic and unhygienic. It was being run from a small room in which there was no infrastructure and equipment for examining samples. The search revealed several reports with digital signatures of many doctors.
 
 Ajay didn’t provide any satisfactory answers during questioning by police. He later said that he identified only one of the doctors, that too from Varanasi.
 
 DCP (northwest) Aslam Khan said when a team led by SHO (Mahendra Park) Virendra Kadyan contacted   (MCI) and Delhi Medical Council (DMC) for information about the doctors whose signatures were there on the reports, it was revealed that none of them existed.
 
 Further inquiry revealed that Ajay had worked in various path labs in UP as an assistant and a courier boy. During that period, he gained knowledge about the tests and also obtained the format of reports. He had opened an office and a website as well. The website showed the lab had conducted over 2,500 different medical tests.
