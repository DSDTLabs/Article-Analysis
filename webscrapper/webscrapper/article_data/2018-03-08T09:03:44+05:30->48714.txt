PANAJI: The regional transport offices (RTOs) in Goa may no longer be a maze for   applicants thanks to the upgraded software   4.0 which has been adopted by the state transport department.

 The technology will make it easy for citizens to fill their licence application online, upload the necessary documents, pay fees through e-transaction and book their slot for a learner’s licence test.
 
 Sarathi 4.0 started at the Panaji   this month. Soon, the system will be expanded to other RTOs in the state.
 
 “Data migration of the software has been done. The staff is being trained to receive applications through this system. We shall implement Sarathi 4.0 soon,” said a Ponda RTO official.
 
 TOI had reported earlier that the state’s RTOs would be upgrading to Sarathi 4.0 and   4.0 from the existing 2.0 versions in a bid to decongest their offices.
 
 The Union ministry had introduced online-based citizen-centric application Sarathi for the registration of vehicles which is being adopted by state transport departments across India. The 2.0 version of the application was being used at the office level by transport officials, but the 4.0 version opens this system to the public domain.
 
 “Dealers have been able to register vehicles from the showroom with Vahan 4.0 and now citizens will be able to apply for a licence and set an appointment for the   test from the comfort of their home through Sarathi 4.0,” an RTO official from   said.
 
 The licence will be delivered to the applicant via post.
