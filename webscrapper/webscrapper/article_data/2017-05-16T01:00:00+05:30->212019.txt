Businessman   from Malaysia, who was in the city for an official trip, looked surprised in the afternoon yesterday when he couldn’t see his shadow in front or behind him. “I wondered why it was so. Soon, I learnt that it was Zero Shadow Day,” he says. Like Leam, several Mumbaikars were intrigued when they witnessed the same phenomenon between 12.34 and 12.36 pm. Engineering student Tanmay Chibade, says, “I had recently read about this online and found it quite interesting. I’m certainly going to read up more on this.” The phenomenon, which was largely experienced in South Mumbai yesterday, will also take place in other parts of the city today around the same time. The occurrence, which takes place halfway between sunrise and sunset, is experienced only in areas between the   and  . This means that even in India, places like Delhi, Leh-Ladakh do not witness this. Explaining the same, astronomer   says, “This concept basically means that on one of these days, the sun will be directly over your head. When that happens, there’s going to be a zero projection of your shadow.”

 
 
 Around noon, the sun is said to be overhead. However, on regular days, the sun’s position at noon is such that one can still see a little bit of shadow on the sides. But on a Zero Shadow Day, the visibility of a shadow is lesser because it’s directly beneath the object. So, if it’s a compact object, for example, a bottle, the shadow will be completely covered by the base of the bottle, making it invisible.
