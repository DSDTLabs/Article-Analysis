MOHALI: The municipal corporation and Greater   Area Development Authority (Gmada) has decided to construct five causeways on the   and other connecting roads to tackle the waterlogging problem that occurs during the monsoon rains.

 A decision in this regard was taken at a meeting on Tuesday. The meeting that was chaired by Mayor   and MC commissioner Sandeep Hans was also attended by executive level officers from Gmada, public health, water supply and respective councillors of the affected areas.
 
 “In the meeting, it was decided that two causeways will come up at   road and three on the roads connecting the airport road. Last year, during monsoon, Mohali experienced flood-like situation after which discussions were held to identify the key water-logging points. Now as per the reports submitted by the officers of Gmada and MC, we have identified such points and are now planning to fix them in a bid to avoid future issues,” the mayor said.
 
 He added it was decided that the causeways would be completed by June-end — much before the arrival of the monsoon in the state. The causeways are to come up at the dividing roads of Sectors 70-71 and 76-77; phase 3B2 and Sector 69; JCT crossing phase 8, phase 3B2 and sector 70-71 roads.
 
 Meanwhile,   is also planning to lay underground pipes to give free flow to rain water opposite Radha Soami Satsang Beas. Mayor Kulwant Singh said that he would talk to the management of the sect to allow the MC to lay the underground pipes between Radha Soami Satsang Beas and Sector 70 so that an uninterrupted water flow can be assured during monsoon rains.
 
 Earlier, rescue teams had to demolish the boundary walls of Radha Soami Satsang Beas to allow release of stagnant rain waters.
