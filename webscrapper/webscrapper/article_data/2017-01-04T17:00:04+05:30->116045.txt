NEW DELHI: Australia opener   walked into record books on the opening day of Sydney Test against Pakistan when he smashed a century in the first session of the day's play, thus becoming only the fourth batsman to do so.

 And he let everyone know how much that century meant to him with charged celebrations on reaching the landmark. Talking about his 18th Test century on Tuesday, the left-hander revealed that every time he walks out to bat at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), the late Australia batsman   is always in his thoughts. 
 
 Hughes died after being struck on the back of his neck by a bouncer during a domestic match back in 2014 with Warner being on the fielding side that day. "Before every time I walk out here we've got our little mate walking with us and always in the back of my mind when I walk out here, he's with me," Warner was quoted as saying by news.com.au on Tuesday.
 
 "I always think he's at the other end with me. Every time I score runs here or score a hundred, it's always for him."
 
 He is also the first Australian since   in 87 years ago to complete a century in the opening session on Day 1 of a Test and the only batsman from his country to do so at home.
 
 Warner completed his century off 78 balls in 117 minutes with the help of 17 fours. He was out after scoring 113 off 95 balls.
