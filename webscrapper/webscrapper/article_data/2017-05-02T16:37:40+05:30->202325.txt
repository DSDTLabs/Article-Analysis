 fans were excited earlier this week to hear news about acclaimed director   once again teaming up with the superstar for a movie titled Wayanadan Thampan.

 The grapevine had it that   scribe   would be scripting the film. While the scriptwriter tells us that such a project is indeed in the works, he is yet to discuss it with Mohanlal. 
 
 Udayakrishna is currently working on Mammootty’s upcoming film with Ajai Vasudevan. Meanwhile, Mohanlal will next be working on Lal Jose’s directorial before he joins the sets of VA Shrikumar’s fantasy thriller Odiyan, which also has Manju Warrier and Prakash Raj in pivotal roles.
