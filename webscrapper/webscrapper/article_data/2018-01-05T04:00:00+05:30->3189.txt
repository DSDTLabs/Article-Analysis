Mumbai:   has become the 11th lender to be placed under the   watch with restrictions on lending and some operational expenses. 

 This move follows an increase in the bankâ€™s non-performing assets that has put pressure on its bottom line and capital base. With this, over half the public sector banks in the country are facing restrictions on lending. 
 
 In a regulatory filing, Allahabad Bank said the RBI has placed it under   (PCA) due to high net non-performing assets and a negative return on assets for two years in a row. The bank, however, added the action would help improve its risk management, asset quality and profits. Once a bank is placed under  , it cannot lend to risky projects, pay dividend to shareholders or increase executive salaries.
 
 Meanwhile, another distressed state-owned lender   said that it would use the Rs 7,650 crore in its share premium account to write off the accumulated losses of the bank aggregating to Rs 6,979 crore as on March 31, 2017.
 
 There are 21 PSU banks. The nationalised banks placed under prompt corrective action include:  ,  , Indian Overseas Bank,  ,  ,  ,  ,   and Corporation Bank.
