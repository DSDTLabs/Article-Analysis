Nagpur: Pankaj Dhote, who had fired two rounds near Shambu Canteen at Borgaon chowk earlier this week, has been remanded in police custody till July 21. He was produced before the court on Friday.

 Dhote, sone of former MNS corporator, was nabbed from Wadhammna near Wadi on Thursday by the crime branch team lead by API Jeetendra Bobade.
 
 Sources in the police said Dhote was fleeing to Amravati district to evade arrest. He was nabbed while returning to the city after a friend called him on his cellphone.
 
 The cyber crime cell played a crucial role in zeroing down on Dhote. Police said Dhote had fled towards Saoner after the firing incident. He later tried to take shelter at a friend’s place at Katol before planning to sneak away to Amravati. Dhote had returned to the city to stay at Borgaon after completing a term of externment in 2016.
 
 It was Dhote’s relentless communication with a friend that helped cops track him down. The Gittikhadan police and crime branch were constantly following him.
 
 Dhote had tried to target Raju Wankhede, who is close to his arch rival Sumeet Thakur. Around a month ago, Thakur has been released from jail on bail after being arrested under MCOCA.
 
 After ransacking Shambhu Canteen, Dhote had fired one round towards Wankhede’s car presuming the target to be inside. Later, he has also fired one round in the air. Police, however, seized an empty case from the place.
