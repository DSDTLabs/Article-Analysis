LONDON:   suggested at the   that the success   and he enjoyed in the two halves of last year may have taken a toll on them mentally and physically in 2017.

 "We both had a very long, very tough year, a lot of matches, a lot of emotions, a lot of things in play," the 30-year-old Serb said. "Our bodies have taken a lot physically. As an athlete at a certain stage of your career, you're going to experience these kind of things. Injuries are part of this sport, unfortunately."
 
 He said tennis was demanding on the body and mind. "Professional tennis is getting very physical in the last couple of years. It's not easy to play at the highest level throughout the season, then be able to do that over and over again every season and stay healthy.
 
 Djokovic, however said it was a cycle. "We do everything in our power. That's why we have a huge amount of people around us in our teams, to make sure that we cover every field or expertise that we possibly can so we can perform as best we can. At the end of the day, we're all humans. We got to go through these stages."
 
 Djokovic, who retired from his quarterfinal clash with   on Wednesday due to a troublesome elbow, said he was thinking of a break from the game. "The specialists that I've talked with haven't been clear as to what needs to be done. They mentioned surgery and some other options,"   said. "As long as it (the pain) comes and goes it's fine. But it's adding up now, maybe it worked for eight-ten months, but the next seven months has not great. The more I play, the worse it gets. A break is something that I will have to consider now."
