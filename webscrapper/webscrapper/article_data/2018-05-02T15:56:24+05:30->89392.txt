The first song from the most chaotic and glamorous wedding 
  of the year, '
 ' is out and it has left us mighty impressed.

 Titled 'Tareefan', the song opens to, a smouldering   and   glaring into the camera with their mesmerising expressions and then moves on to steamy scenes featuring the girls having some fun with men around. They seem to be giving no two hoots about the world, as they live life king-size on their own terms. The song further sees   and   joining the girls to have fun. Dressed to the nines in shimmery outfits, the ladies are seen swaying their hips and owning the night.
 
 Sung by Badshah, the music has been composed by QARAN, while the lyrics have been penned by QARAN, Rupin Pahwa and Badshah.
