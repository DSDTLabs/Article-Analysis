GUWAHATI: Hundreds of   (KMSS) activists along with the members its women wing-   marched to the Board of Secondary  , Assam (Seba) headquarters here on Wednesday, demanding   

 The mammoth rally was taken out from the Chandmari area of the city and ended at the Seba headquarters at Bamunimaidam. The protesters staged a dharna there demanding reforms in the all-important class X state board exam conducted by Seba after state education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma recently said in the assembly that the results of the matric exam conducted by the board are being 'fixed' since 2001 under instructions from the government.
 
 "We demand the government to stop political influence on Seba. The education board has its own authority over exam-related matters and that's why Seba officials cannot approach a minister on matters related to exam results. It is a conspiracy of the BJP-led government, mostly against the vernacular medium schools affiliated to Seba," said KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi.
