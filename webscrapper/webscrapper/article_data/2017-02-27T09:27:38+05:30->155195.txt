NEW DELHI: The parents of 49 students with disabilities studying at  's Mehta Vidyalaya, KG Marg, on Saturday alleged that the school is planning to “shut down its inclusive wing“. The parents and other disability rights activists met at Central Park in   and have planned to meet the disability commissioner on Tuesday.

 However, the school management refuted the claims and said the special wing continues to function and as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009.
 
 The general secretary of association of special education and allied professionals, Hector Ravinder Dutt, has started an online petition.
 
 “It's a matter of life and plight of 49 differently abled children studying at BVB   at the special wing.Now suddenly the school authorities have shut down the special wing.School authorities are giving dubious and misleading statements to the parents. They are being kept in the dark. This act is going to jeopardise the future of these children,“ the petition states.
 
 A parent alleged that there used to be 10 special educators with the school's inclusive wing.
 
 “Now there are just four. The rest were shifted to the mainstream school.All the 49 students are taught in a single classroom, though they are in different classes. The school stopped entry-level enrolment of students in the inclusive wing two years ago. They are shutting down the wing gradually,“ the parent alleged.
 
 The school principal, Dr Anju Tandon, said that all the allegations are baseless and the school is following RTE and directorate of education's rules.“We are not closing the special wing. As per the RTE Act, we are not supposed to segregate children with disabilities from mainstream students, so they are being taught with regular students. The special educators are there with the mainstream school to cater to their special needs."
