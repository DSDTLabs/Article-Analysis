VADODARA: Additional chief secretary (health)  , who has been asked to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the controversy regarding alleged violation of tender conditions in the Sanjaynagar slum rehabilitation project, visited the city on Friday. 

 Parmar spoke to Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) officials and collected documents of the project.
 
 A controversy was raked up regarding the housing scheme after allegations that the VMC was asked to make a storm water drain on the land on which the slums once stood and even issued tenders for the same. As per tender conditions it was the contractor who should have made the storm water drain.
 
 It was also alleged that the stakes in the joint venture (JV) company that had taken up the projects were changed. The consortium of   (NRPL), Sai Ruchi and DMC Infra Developers had initially stated that   had 51 per cent stake in the JV, but after the work order was given to the JV in May 2017, the stake of NRPL was reduced to 15 per cent. This too, VMC officials say, was in violation of tender conditions.
 
 While the tenders for the storm water drain were brought out by the VMC in October 2017 and it was informed about the change in the stake holdings in JV in June 2017, it issued notices to the contractor regarding these issues in December. Raopura MLA   reportedly took up the issue with chief minister Vijay Rupani.
 
 Parmar met VMC officials including municipal commissioner Vinod Rao and collected documents pertaining to the contract. He also visited the site in the   area. Sources said that after gathering more details from other parties involved with the contract, Parmar is expected to give a report within a week.
