 Road safety experts point to lack of proper enforcement as the prime reason for the high number of accidents in the city.
 
 “There was no significant dip in the number of road accidents in the city over the past three years. One major point of concern is the huge number of vehicles plying without undergoing fitness checks, which check the condition of the vehicle’s brakes, tyres, headlights and mirrors.   must be renewed regularly,” Vinod K Kanumala, CEO of the Indian Federation of Road Safety, said.
 
 The latest CAG report also pointed out that over 20,163 vehicles were currently plying without valid fitness certificates across the state and pose a serious threat to ‘public safety’. “Vehicles were plying without fitness certificates (FCs) due to lack of alerts in the system and failure of the department to ensure renewal of FCs,” it added.
