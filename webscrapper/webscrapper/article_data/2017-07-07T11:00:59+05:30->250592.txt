MYSURU: Differences in JD(S) supremo  's family over ticket allotment ahead of assembly polls surfaced on Thursday with Prajwal Revanna, son of former minister H D Revanna, questioning the move to deny him ticket from Hunsur segment in   district. 

 However, he said he would abide by the party's decision. Prajwal, 21, said the party is promoting suitcase culture, in an oblique reference to elevation of the rich as against those who have worked at the grassroot level. Speaking at a meeting of JD(S) activists in Hunsur, Prajwal, who has been active in the region for six months, said: "I aspire to contest from Hunsur but will abide by the party's decision". 
 
 This is in contrast to Kumaraswamy's assertion that the party will give tickets to only two members from the family. He has said Revanna will contest the polls besides him. Kumaraswamy is pitching for former MP Adagooru H   from Hunsur, which has ruffled the feathers of Prajwal's supporters. Vishwanath, who quit the   last month, joined the JD(S) on Tuesday.
 
 According to Prajwal, he wanted a win from the Hunsur segment to deny the Congress a hattrick. He said he wants to see Kumarswamy as the chief minister and asked partymen to work towards the goal. 
 
 While Kumarswamy has indicated that Vishwanath could be fielded from Hunsur, Gowda is non-committal. Before Vishwanath's inclusion, he had said the party would decide on the Hunsur candidate later. Former minister G T Devegowda is also eyeing the segment for his son Harish Gowda. He had stayed away from party activities for a month but relented after Kumaraswamy visited his house.
