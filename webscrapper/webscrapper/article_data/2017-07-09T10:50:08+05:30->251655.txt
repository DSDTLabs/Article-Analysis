COIMBATORE: For the Indian democracy to remain vibrant, the participation of citizens in the process of governance through proper discharge of their duties is of paramount importance, justice   said here on Saturday. People vehemently oppose the violation of their rights such as equality, freedom of speech, right to life and expression, he said while speaking at the 16 th convocation ceremony at  .

 “It is necessary to know not only your rights, but also the duties imposed on you by the Constitution. The idea behind the incorporation of the fundamental duties was to emphasise the obligations of the citizens in reciprocation to the comprehensive fundamental rights enjoyed by them,” he said.
 
 The justice also called for abandoning the practices that are derogatory to the dignity of women. “Women need to be treated equally with respect and dignity,” he said adding that any kind of discriminatory behaviour against women in the workplace should be done away with.
 
 “Another important duty imposed is to develop scientific temper, humanism and spirit of inquiry and form. These duties were incorporated in the Constitution to inspire a sense of oneness and national pride. One should look past the obvious and apparent differences to see the country as a united whole,” he said. He also urged youngsters to follow the law and ensure peace.
