MUMBAI: Nearly 450 first-year engineering students from one of the sought-after engineering colleges in Bandra have been asked to be shifted to nearby colleges in the middle of the academic term, after an order was passed by the   ( ) last week. 

 The council has asked the directorate of technical education ( ) to shift first-year students from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College to nearby colleges due to the institute's failure to submit its   within a stipulated period. The college now plans to seek legal reprieve in the matter.
 
 The 11-storeyed building on the campus of RD National College has failed to submit occupancy certificate for the top two floors within the deadline prescribed by the Bombay high court. The college was put in the `no-admission' list for the 2016 17 academic year for the lack of occupancy certificate for these two floors. However, the management sought a stay on the order issued by AICTE and gave an undertaking in court that they would get the OC within four months. The stay order was passed on June 8 last year.
 
 The AICTE, therefore, in a letter dated January 24, asked the DTE to shift the affected students to nearby approved institutions. Since the college was on the no-admission list, the admission in the first-year engineering programme was void.
 
 A college official, however, said that they are almost in the process of acquiring the OC and would seek legal intervention if needed. “The latest handbook from the council itself says that OC is not a compulsory document for 2016-17 academic session and will be essential from 2017-18. The building has the sanction from the civic body , but the process of acquiring OC is almost over. We will move court if the circular is imposed,“ said the official.
 
 Meanwhile, most students have been given admissions on provisional basis.
