Tirupur: A social worker has demanded Tirupur corporation to give him compensation of Rs 250 per day or maximum Rs 25,000 per year as he claims that he was humiliated by its authorities when he asked information under the RTI Act.

 Under the act, S Sundarapandian of Nalaiya Tirupur Makkal Amaippu had filed two applications in order to seek answers for a total of 31 questions from the corporation. 
 
 The executive engineers (EEs), S Thirumurugan (South) and MVD Tamilselvan (North), who are also public information officers (PIOs), replied that they can’t provide the information as they felt the applicant’s aim was to disturb the them rather than obtaining the information. 
 
 Moreover, they felt the applicant had sought a lot of information on different subjects in one application, which would ‘force’ the government officials to spend more time to collect details.
 
 Now, Sundarapandian has appealed before the city engineer (CE) against the EEs’s replies. “The public information officers have intentionally given an inappropriate reply, which leads to disbelief. So, the CE should kindly analyse and provide right and complete answers to my questions,” he said. 
 
 “Moreover, the civic body should provide compensation of Rs 250 per day or Rs 25, 000 per year for humiliating me and not providing the information. Otherwise, I will appeal against them before the state information commissioner,” he said.
