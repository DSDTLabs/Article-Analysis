BENGALURU: One of the pre-eminent   of the country, The  , wants more boys from the south. With less than 4% of the students on its rolls (22 of 580) coming from the southern states, the institution is seeing a dwindling number of  . 

  "We are looking at directing our bursaries, broadening our pool of applicants by collaborating with not-for-profit school groups in the region, and doing what we can to grow people's awareness. Doon had boys from souther India but with the end of government scholarships in 1990s, and the growth of good day schools in the country, we are seeing fewer applicants," The Doon School headmaster   told TOI. 
 
 Since early 2000, the school has been building its bursary fund with a view to having a needs-blind admission process. This, Matthew said, is to ensure that they support any exceptional boy who requires financial aid to come to The Doon School. "We would be delighted to have five times as many boys from the southern states; this would help redress the balance," he said.
 
  "We want to make sure our admission process allows us to find those boys and live up to a meritocratic vision for the school and the country," the headmaster said. 
 
 "The   offer financial aid to anyone we accept who needs it," he said. Over 25% of Doon students receive needs-based bursaries, including several that cover all costs associated with attending the school.
 
  Every year, boys take tests in the first round of the admission process of The Doon School. "Some are registered at birth by fathers who want their sons to follow in their footsteps, others a month or so before the test. Traditionally we have tests for English, Maths, Hindi, Verbal and Non-Verbal Reasoning; the idea being that these would indicate a boy's capacity for success at the school," Matthews explained. The tests are followed by an interview for those who meet what is agreed to be a suitable cut-off.
