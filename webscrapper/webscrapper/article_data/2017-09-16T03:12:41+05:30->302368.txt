GURUGRAM: Eight   stations in the city will be   down for 24 hours, starting from 2pm on Saturday, for   pipelines, which are hindering the ongoing road construction work at several places along the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway. 

 The fuel stations, which will remain closed, include the ones located in sectors 31 and 15 (on NH-8), sectors 14, 22, 86 and 89. Also, CNG will not be available at the Sector 12 bus stand depot and the Pataudi Road station.
 
 According to Haryana City Gas Distribution Limited (HCGDL), the shutdown will temporarily impact supply of CNG for automobiles as well as PNG to commercial and industrial consumers located westwards from Sector 31. The supply will be resumed after 2 pm on Sunday. However, PNG supply to domestic customers will not be affected due to the 24-hoir shutdown.
 
 “The eastern part of   will remain unaffected, unless something unexpected occurs after starting the work,” Deepak Sharma, manager (finance), HCGDL.
 
 HCGDL sources said the shutdown would be imposed to clear the decks for shifting of the pipeline that is coming in the way of the expansion of the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway at several places, including Iffco Chowk, Signature Tower Chowk, Rajiv Chowk and Man esar. “CNG customers are advised to tank up keeping in mind the 24-hour shutdown,” said an HCGDL official.
