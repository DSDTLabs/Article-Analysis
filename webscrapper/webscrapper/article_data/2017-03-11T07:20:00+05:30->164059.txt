BENGALURU: Chaos does not rule in Rajajinagar the way it does in Indiranagar and Koramangala, but the west   is staring at transformation, something that its residents are wary of.

 “Rajajinagar is a residential area but that hasn’t stopped shops, convention halls and eateries flourishing in the locality,” says Naveen Kumar, a resident of 3rd Block.
 
 “The area has seen an unusual rise in realty prices with more commercial set ups opening here. Living in Rajajinagar has of late become expensive. Worsening traffic and parking scene has only added to the residents’ woes,” Kumar says.
 
 Residents complain about street vendors taking over the pavements in the area, forcing residents and pedestrians to walk on main roads.
 
 “Numerous shops have come up on lanes in various blocks. Shops have opened in many road-facing houses, with cars and two wheelers haphazardly parked outside. This leads to congestion and makes it difficult for the residents to find space to park their vehicles,” said B V Sudarshan, who lives in Rajajinagar 4th block for over 50 years.
 
 M Sudeendra, a resident of Rajajinagar for the past 40 years, has seen the locality change. “At points where the lanes intersect the main road, houses and plots have commercial ventures running out of them, especially near Bashyam Circle, from 5th Block to 6th Block. This causes traffic jams at entrance of the lanes as people coming here park their cars along them,” he says.
 
 “There is a textile plant right in the middle of the area, which has led to the elderly facing breathing problems and other respiratory issues,” Sudeendra says.
 
 “Close to our apartment complex is a steel mill, which exhales soot and dust, making it difficult for the residents to breathe. The insides of our houses get covered with dust. The government has allocated land to them somewhere else but they haven’t moved out. Other factories around the complex also create a lot of noise,” says a resident of Esteem Classic Apartments.
