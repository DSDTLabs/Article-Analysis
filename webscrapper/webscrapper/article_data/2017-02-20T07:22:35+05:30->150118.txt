PUNE: The BJP’s move to give tickets to candidates with criminal background has not gone down well with the parent organisation, the   (RSS), workers of which have found it increasingly embarrassing to defend such nominees.

 “The party has given tickets to outsiders (who joined the   ahead of the polls) in many wards and they are totally unaware of the RSS school of thought. It is surprising that the party has not given any preference to many of its loyal workers when giving out tickets,” an RSS member said.
 
 “It will be interesting to see if the BJP will benefit anything from this move (giving tickets to outsiders),” a BJP supporter said, adding that the policy of inviting outsiders was there even during 2014 assembly polls.
 
 When quizzed about the issue, the BJP leaders said all our partymen have been working together. “These are only the opposition parties that are making a big noise about it. Our party has given tickets on merit after checking the background of every candidate,” a leader from BJP’s city unit said.
 
 Rivals make hay
 
 Though the RSS workers have not expressed their views publicly because of “political compulsions”, the rival parties are attempting to score browny points on the issue.
 
 NCP chief   has criticized BJP’s choice of nominees and has appealed to voters to check the background of the BJP candidates before casting their votes.
 
 Earlier, Shiv Sena chief   had also slammed the BJP saying the party has preferred outsiders and that too people with criminal cases. “Pune has a huge legacy of RSS cadre and many veterans are still active. Despite having a strong base, the BJP has preferred newcomers. Will RSS cadre accept this move?” Thackeray had asked.
