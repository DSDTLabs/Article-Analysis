Surat: “I have set my foot in Surat after 20 years. Last time when I came, I went straight to Navsari from the airport here. Surat is khoobsurat. Sitting in Mumbai we don’t realize how much India has progressed. Surat is a prime example of the progress that the country has made,” noted industrialist and chairman emeritus of Tata Sons Ratan Tata said here on Thursday.  Tata was in the city because he had made a promise to chairman of Shree Ramkrishna Exports Pvt. Ltd (SRK) Govind Dholakiya that he would visit his family.  He had expressed his inability to come to Surat when Santokba Award was conferred on him a year ago. However, he had promised the Dholakiya family then that he would visit them someday.  Tata visited their diamond unit and viewed with interest the modern polishing and cutting process of diamonds and praised its research and development. “I never thought that we do this in India and that too in Surat. I had no idea that such a business could ever happen in India. Why can’t we do same thing in the field of electronics? he asked the generation next of Dholakiya family.  Tata talked to the youngsters of Dholakiya family the differences between a professional-run company like Tata and a family firm which is SRK. He hinted that in many family firms first generation and second generation don’t agree on the choice of businesses that they want to do and also there are cases where both have succeeded too. He felt diversification is the way of life even in business, adding that he doesn’t want to be remembered as a wealth creator, but someone who made a difference to the lives of ordinary people.  He thanked the country as he was born in a land of equal opportunities. Tata said had he not born here, he wouldn’t have been able to do what he wanted to do to help people.
