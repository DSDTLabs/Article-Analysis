Ghaziabad: Over Rs 216 crore was approved by the district planning committee of   on Monday for various infrastructure   across the district during the financial year 2018-19. The decision was taken at a meeting of the committee presided over by UP cabinet minister for urban development, Suresh Khanna.

 The lion’s share of the funds — Rs 59 crore — has been allocated for construction and maintenance of various roads and bridges. For boosting water supply in rural areas, the committee has allocated Rs 7.40 crore in rural areas and Rs 1.92 crore for urban areas.
 
 The projects will be undertaken through various social welfare schemes sponsored by both the Centre and UP government. The sum has been allocated under 48 different heads in total.
 
 “Our efforts are aimed at providing all-round development to the district. There is a huge gap in literacy rates between females and males in UP. The average literacy rate in Kerala is above 96 per cent. We will work towards increasing this rate. There was a target of installing 50,000 LED streetlights in Ghaziabad. Around 47,000 LED lamps have already been installed. The target will be met soon. Ghaziabad has also performed well in collection of taxes and revenues in the last financial year,” said Khanna.
 
 Khanna was part of a three-member delegation of ministers appointed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath last year to end the impasse between builders and buyers over delay in delivery of flats. On Monday, he reviewed the progress made in delivery of flats and legal action taken against developers by the administration for not handing over possession in time.
 
 “Around 16,000 units were under construction, of which 9,000 have been handed over. A total of seven FIRs have been registered against the errant developers,” said district magistrate Ritu Maheshwari.
