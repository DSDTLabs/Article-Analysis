PUNE: Shivkanta Shankar Hude, a 68-year-old resident of Hadapsar, on Saturday succumbed to injuries she had sustained in an   on Thursday.

 Hude was severely injured when she was knocked down by a speeding car on Thursday evening. At the time of the accident, she was having tea in front of her house at Jehangirnagar in Hadapsar. 
 
 The car then rammed a motorcycle. The driver left the car on the spot and fled the scene, said sub-inspector Amit Walke of Mundhwa police.
 
 Walke told TOI that at 5.30pm on Thursday, Hude was sitting on in front of her house, which is along the road in Jehangirnagar. “Around 5.30pm, the car, coming the Bhimnagar side, knocked her down. She fell on the road and sustained severe injuries,” Walke said.
 
 The car driver, instead of stopping, sped ahead and tried to take a U-turn back to Bhimnagar, Walke said. “In that attempt, the car rammed a motorcycle, whose rider also sustained injuries,” Walke said.
 
 The policeman said the driver then left the car at the spot of the accident and fled. “We have yet to trace the driver. We do not know whether the driver was drunk or if a minor was driving the car,” Walke said.
 
 The police have discovered that the car was registered with the RTO in Mumbai. “The owner of the car may had sold it in Pune. Our probe is on,” Walke said.
