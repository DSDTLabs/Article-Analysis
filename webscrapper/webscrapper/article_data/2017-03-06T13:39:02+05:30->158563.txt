If we talk about celebrities' wardrobes, Shraddha Kapoor's closet is full of some amazing stuff that has probably gone unnoticed by the fashion stalkers. Her outfits are comfy and stylish, and the actress has some girl-next-door vibes that make us all associate with her. Shraddha turns 30 today, and she's definitely got her own sense of style. We have picked out 5 of her outfits that we would love to steal (though, it's not legit!) from her wardrobe. Here, take a look... 

  1. This is a perfect date night dress. This off-shoulder black gown is sensuous yet minimalistic, and the thigh-high slit is bound to make anyone fall head over heels.
  
  
 
 2. This gorgeous blue suit with the right amount of shimmer is an ideal pick for any festive occasion. It flatters almost every body type, and is quite easy to pull off.
  
  
 
 3. A basic pair of jeans is there in every girl closet. Shraddha has teamed it up with a cool knotted shirt and a jacket.
  
  
 
 4. This dress will bombard you with beachy vibes. Cute shorts with a matching tee printed with palm trees...we feel like packing our bags and heading to GOA right now!
  
  
 
 5. A red dress is a must in every girl's closet, and something like this is elegant, fuss free and a head turner.
