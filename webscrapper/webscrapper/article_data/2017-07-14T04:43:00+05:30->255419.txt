Mumbai: The   on Thursday directed the BMC to produce material showing why two crosses in Bandra (West) are marked for demolition. A bench of Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Vibha Kankanwadi heard a petition by the   regarding the crosses at   and at   which were issued demolition notices on June 24. The HC on June 30, in an interim order, restrained BMC from demolishing them.

 The Sabha moved the HC afresh to challenge individual demolition notices after the court last month declined to pass a general order staying demolition of crosses. It also challenged the committee set up by the state government’s May 5, 2011, circular to identify unauthorised religious shrines and categorise them. The circular divided illegal shrines prior to September 29, 2009 into three categories – those to be regularized, demolished and relocated. Its petition said the cross at Chapel Road is shown in the city survey record and has a property card. Also, documents show the cross at Nandi Cinema existed since 1937 and it is also in a heritage precinct.
 
 The judges noted both crosses are under B category, where shrines have to be demolished. Senior advocate  , representing the Sabha, said the cross at Chapel Road has existed since 1948. “We have made representation to the committee but they have not passed any order,” he said. The judges directed that “BMC shall produce material on the basis of which two holy crosses are classified in B category.” Posting the next hearing on August 21, the judges directed the stay on demolition shall continue.
