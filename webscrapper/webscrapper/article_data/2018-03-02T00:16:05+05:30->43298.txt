NEW DELHI: Students of Lady Shri Ram College on Thursday took out a   march, which brought residents of Lajpat Nagar and Amar Colony out of their homes to the calls of “My  , My Rights”.

 The march comes in the backdrop of a series of incidents, where students of   have been hit by balloons allegedly filled with urine and semen around their college near the upscale Kailash Colony.
 
 The protest march, attended not just by students of LSR, but also the neighbouring Delhi Institute of Hotel Management, started from the college gate and proceeded to the interiors of Amar Colony, through the main market of Lajpat Nagar.
 
 The protesters held public talks at key points on their way, addressing youngsters and parents on the issue. 
 
 The women implored the parents to ensure that their children don’t target passersby with balloons and also asked elder members of the family to be against any kind of unsolicited Holi ‘celebrations’. 
 
 The message was, however, hard to get past, especially when the women — during the march — remained a target to water-filled balloon projectiles. Around 20 minutes into the march, at least 10 protesters had been hit by unsolicited balloons, despite a police perimeter.
 
 In fact, police officers had to intervene to stop some children from indulging in balloon throwing, later taking up the centre-stage themselves to inform residents that Section 144 had been imposed in the area, and any balloon throwing incidents would be followed up with legal investigation.
 
 On Thursday, a National Commission Women team visited LSR and met with the principal and students to take stock of the situation. “The NCW took suo motu cognisance and met the students and faculty of LSR,” NCW acting chairperson Rekha Sharma said.
