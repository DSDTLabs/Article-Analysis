KOLKATA: Three brothers, co-owners of a unit at  , were injured on Friday after the man they had borrowed money from threw acid at them. The accused, Arrman, also ended up spilling some acid on his father who was present at the spot. The four injured have been admitted to a nursing home in Park Circus.

 On Thursday afternoon, UP-based money lender   and his son Arrman visited the leather unit run by brothers Md Aslam, Md Imran and Md Nishad to talk about the trio not repaying Rs 6 lakh out of the Rs 26 lakh they had borrowed.
 
 As tempers rose, Arrman picked up a 10-litre can of acid at the shop and threw the contents at the brothers. However, since the cap wasn’t tight enough, some of the chemical was spilled on Haji. All four sustained severe burns. 
 
 Additional SP (east) Saikat Ghosh said, “We suspect it was Arrman who threw the acid. We have charged him with threatening and throwing acid under sections 326A and 506 IPC.”
