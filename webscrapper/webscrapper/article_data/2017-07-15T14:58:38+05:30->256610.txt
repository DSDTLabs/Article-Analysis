GUWAHATI: The   (SDRF) and Fire and   (F&ES) have deployed at least 32 teams across the state to combat any kind of emergency arising out of floods as the situation remained critical on Friday. 

 Special director general of F&ES AP Rout told TOI, "Over 3,000 personnel from both SDRF and F&ES have been deployed for round-the-clock job. About 106 boats are currently plying all over the state for carrying out rescue operations." Though Assam has only two SDRF companies, the fire fighters of F&ES are busy assisting the operations so far. So far, 2,000 people and 10 domestic animals have been rescued. The SDRF teams have been asked to remain alert for any kind of emergency on locations where the embankments have become vulnerable due to swelling rivers. "A team is on guard at   embankment in   district which has developed breaches. Our teams are also busy plugging these breaches. Besides, locations prone to erosion have also been marked and rescue teams are on guard," the DG said. 
 
 The department has also taken measures to provide food packets to rescue teams so that they can continue the operations without any interruption.
 
 "Refreshments have been provided. However, all rescue teams are struggling due to manpower shortage and inadequate logistics support. Many are sleep deprived and working for more than 14-15 hours a day," said Diganta, an SDRF personnel engaged in rescue operations in   district. At least 256 people were rescued on 34 boats in the district on Friday.
