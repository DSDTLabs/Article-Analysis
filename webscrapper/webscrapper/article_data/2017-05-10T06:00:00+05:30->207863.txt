KOLKATA: A close friend of Sonika met her outside Phoenix at The Astor on the fateful night. Declining to disclose his identity, he narrated what happened when they went pub-hopping.

 Around 12.30am, Sonika and three other friends arrived at Phoenix in Vikram’s car. I am guessing   had at least two or three vodkas at Phoenix. Sonika was drinking too. But a common friend of ours and I had juice and  . Till 1.30am, we all partied at Phoenix. 
 
 The next stop was Underground. As this common friend’s car was kept at Myx, I dropped him there. He and I were supposed to drive our cars. At 1.55am, Sonika called me up, asking where I was. We spoke for 11 seconds. I told her we were heading for Underground. Vikram and Sonika didn’t stay there for long. We even took a photo at Underground. Our last picture taken was at 2.14am. I saw Vikram drinking there too.
 
 In our generation, a huge percentage of youngsters drink and drive. So, it is not uncommon for Vikram to do that. There have been multiple occasions when Vikram messed up after drinking. But that night, he seemed quite sober. I never anticipated this accident would happen. Besides, how can I stop a 30-year-old man from driving?
 
 I returned home after partying till 3.30am. I kept both my mobiles on silent. The cops told me had I not kept my phone on silent, it would have been easier for them to trace Sonika’s family. Vikram will have to live with this guilt of Sonika having met with this accident due to his negligence. It’s important to own up to one’s mistakes. I hope, Vikram will do so at some point. I want him to live a guilt-free life. He is a friend too.
