PANAJI: Almost   in the state are lacking in fire   compliance, putting the lives of thousands of students at risk. A safety audit, conducted by the directorate of fire and emergency services, recently found that 554 of these are in fact government educational institutions. 

 A large number of these — 128 — fall under the jurisdiction of the Valpoi fire station, while 91 are in Ponda. Fire officials found that educational institutions didn’t have fire extinguishers, and also lacked adequate water storage facilities. 
 
 In Margao, close to 100 private educational institutuons were found to be flouting fire safety guidelines. In fact, the town’s fire station, that has jurisdiction over the entire Salcete taluka, has 239 institutions — schools, hospitsls, and offices — flouting basic fire safety norms. 
 
 In the health sector too, fire safety was found wanting. A total of 140 hospitals, both government and private, didn’t have fire hydrants and fire detection systems. In some cases, the fire safety equipment was found to be nonfunctional.
 
 Instead of setting an example, the government has also been flouting fire safety guidelines. The directorate of fire and emergency services has identified close to 500 government offices and buildings in the state that don’t have adequate fire safety provisions in place. 
 
 A high number of these offices were found to be in the jurisdictions of Margao, Curchorem, Valpoi and Panaji fire stations. 
 
 The directorate of fire and emergency services has sent recommendations to all the 1431 institutions flouting fire norms, an official said. 
 
 Between 2011 and 2017, 18 human and 16 animal lives have been lost due to fires. Fires during the past seven years have also left 51 people injured.
