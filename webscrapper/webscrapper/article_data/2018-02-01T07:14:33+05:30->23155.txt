ALLAHABAD: Amid reports that Justice   of the   was indicted by an in-house inquiry committee that probed allegations against him in the   (MCI) admission scam case and had proceeded on a 90-day leave after all judicial work had been withdrawn from him, registrar general Mohd Faiz Alam Khan confirmed on Wednesday that Justice Shukla had stopped coming to court. 

 Khan, however, refused comment on reports of “withdrawal of judicial work” from Justice Shukla and his “90-day leave”. He said at the most he could only say that Justice Shukla is not coming to the high court. The high court did not release any official communication regarding either withdrawal of work from Justice Shukla or his leave.
 
 Justice Shukla was under probe for allegations of overruling restraint orders passed by the   on August 29, 2017, to allow GCRG Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, to admit students for the 2017-18 academic year. He had allegedly made handwritten corrections on September 4 to his own bench’s order of September 1 to allow this medical college to admit students for the 2017-18 academic session.
 
 
 
 
 However, on November 23, the Supreme Court had passed a final order in the case stating that the High Court did not show judicial propriety and ordered GCRG Institute of Medical Sciences to pay Rs 10 lakh to each student who had taken admission apart from refunding their fees. A fine of Rs 25 lakh was also imposed by the Supreme Court on the medical college, which had been debarred by the MCI for many deficiencies.
 
 The in-house inquiry committee comprised Madras High Court Chief Justice Indira Banerjee, Sikkim High Court Chief Justice S K Agnihotri and Madhya Pradesh High Court Chief Justice P K Jaiswal.
