TV personality  's mother-in-law, Jo Wood, has said that she did not know the star was battling with depression.
 
  The 35-year-old DJ has spoken candidly about her battle with mental illness between 2009 and 2015 in her new book 'Happy', but the news came as a shock to Wood, who said "I only found out about it (depression) when the book came out", reported Femalefirst.
  
  "She never sat down with me and said, 'Jo, I'm depressed.' But being on anti-depressants was good for Fearne and it was a good step for her to acknowledge she wasn't feeling well.
  
  "I didn't know that Fearne had ever felt low. To me, she's always been this lovely, bubbly, happy person - but being with Jesse has been brilliant for her and she's better now," Wood said.
