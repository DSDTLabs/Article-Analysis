CHENNAI: Alleging that the   government and the state   commission (SEC) are hand in-glove in deferring the conduct of local body elections for political reasons, the   on Tuesday moved a fresh plea in the Madras high court seeking a direction to the   to conduct the elections immediately. 

 "The SEC has failed to consider that under the scheme of the Constitution, no local body shall be kept vacant after the expiry of the five-year term. Election has to be conducted and completed before the expiry of the five-year term as set out under Articles 243-E and 243-U of the Constitution. However, the Tamil Nadu government is periodically amending Municipal and Panchayat Acts and issuing government orders for extending the term of the special officers which is ultra vires of the Constitution," said senior counsel P Wilson representing the DMK. 
 
 If there was any impediment in conducting the elections due to non-cooperation on part of the state government, the state election commissioner was duty-bound to approach the high court under Article 226 of the Constitution, Wilson said. However, the commissioner had failed to perform his duty since he was nominated by the ruling party, he added. 
 
 The petitioner then sought the court to direct the SEC to hold elections to all the local bodies, including panchayats and municipalities, within a time-frame fixed by the court. 
 
 Opposing the plea, the SEC submitted that the issue was pending before the Supreme Court and also in the file of a division bench of the High Court. 
 
 However, noting that it was clear from the interim order of the Supreme Court that there was no stay in conducting the election, Justice M Duraiswamy ordered notice to the SEC and the state government returnable by four weeks.
