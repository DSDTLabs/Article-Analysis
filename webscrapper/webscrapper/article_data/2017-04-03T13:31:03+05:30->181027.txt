NEW DELHI: Senior Congressman, former MLA and cabinet minister in the Sheila Dikshit government, Dr  , has threatened to quit the party. 

 The cause of his resentment lies in the manner in which the Delhi  , led by  , has distributed tickets for the municipal polls in Lakshmi Nagar area which he represented in the past.
 
 "I am angry and disillussioned at the way in which ticket distribution has been done. After dilly-dallying for days, now they have denied ticket to the candidate I had recommended for one of the four wards in Lakshmi Nagar assembly. We have been working in the area and if this is how the party treats someone so senior like me, then I should quit. I have written to Ajay Maken and AICC Delhi in-charge PC Chacko."
 
 Walia said he is waiting to hear from the top leadership and will take a decision accordingly. He said he has been trying to meet Chacko. "The AICC Delhi in-charge is not meting me despite attempts to contact him since Sunday night," Walia told TOI.
 
 Walia's outburst is the first public show of unrest brewing within the Congress. He was the senior most cabinet minister in the three term Congress led the government till 2013. He is known to be a low profile member and was a well respected MLA in his tenure from Lakshmi Nagar.
