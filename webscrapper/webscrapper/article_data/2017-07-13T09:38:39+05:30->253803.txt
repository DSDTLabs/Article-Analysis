MADURAI: “My search for peace has ended in Kodaikanal,’’ said rights activist   as she arrived at the sub registrar’s office in Kodaikanal on Wednesday to file an application to tie the knot with her British partner Desmond Coutinho. 

 “I want to lead the life of a normal woman,” said the 45-year-old internationally renowned   activist whose 16-year-long fast against the controversial Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act ended on August 9, 2016. However, the gruelling struggle which took a toll on her health had failed to win her political mileage as she could garner only 90 votes in the   elections. She had contested the elections under the banner of People’s Resurgence and Justice Alliance party which she formed after ending the fast. At Perumalmalai in Kodaikanal where she moved to after the election, she expressed a wish to get married to her partner. 
 
 As per the court marriage procedure, the marriage officer of the district where the event is to be held has to be informed of the intention to marry. If the ceremony is to be held at a place other than the native place of the couple, at least one of them has to have stayed at the place where the wedding is planned at least for 30 days prior to the wedding. Sub registrar Rajesh who received the application from the couple issued a notice to this effect and put it up prominently in the office on Wednesday. If no objection is raised within 30 days the couple could go ahead with their marriage. 
 
 Sharmila said that she found Kodaikanal peaceful and that she enjoyed the liberty to roam the streets without any disturbance. On being asked if she would take up activism again, she said, "Anyone is free to fight for their rights in free India,’’, adding that she would rise to the occasion if the need arose. On her plans post marriage, Sharmila said she would participate in the international youth conference being held in   from September 17 to September 20.
