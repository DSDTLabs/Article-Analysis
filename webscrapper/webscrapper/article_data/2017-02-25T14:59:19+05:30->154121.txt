Actress   says there is still some chance that   could be back as Bond for the next 007 installment. 

 The Oscar-nominated actress plays   in Craig's current revamp. 
 
 "I really don't think that they've moved on from Daniel. I think there's a very good chance that Daniel will come back. I think it's way too early to be thinking about other people at this stage," she said. 
 
  
  
 The 40-year-old 'Moonlight' star said there was a collective desire from the cast for Craig's return after the previous two films, 'Spectre' and 'Skyfall,' performed well. 
 
 "They desperately want him to return. And I don't think Daniel is immune to that... I think he's very aware, so I think that adds an extra level of pressure. But he has to ultimately do what feels right to him."
 
 "But I know that we, as a cast, collectively want him back. I know that Barbara and Michael - our producers - desperately want him back, so I think the only person that needs persuading is Daniel," she said.
