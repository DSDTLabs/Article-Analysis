AHMEDABAD: Raksha Shakti University (RSU) has recommended a chapter on   in textbooks for class 9 and 11 so that teenagers can understand cyber threats such as stalking and bullying. The eight-page chapter is ready and the RSU will soon send it to the   for a review.

 According to the RSU director, additional DGP Vikas Sahay, teenagers these days have been spending much more time on internet than others and thus facing a greater risk of cyber hazards. “We want the teenagers to understand the security aspect of the cyber world. About two months back, we had started an initiative to educate the teenagers about the dos and the don’ts of the cyber world,” said Sahay.
 
 Sahay said that the chapter will be included either in social studies or science textbooks. “Many teenagers use cyber space but they don’t know about malware and how it can harm their devices. We often get mails and social media messages with links. Clicking on these links could make your private data vulnerable,” he said.
 
 The chapter also includes information on ransomware. “Recently, there have been cases of such ransomwares sneaking into your devices and leaving you in a situation where you have to pay money to access your data. We have suggested preventive ways to deal with such threats,” added Sahay.
 
 RSU is also preparing for presentations in different schools on cyber security to educate students. “The presentations will start from next Tuesday and will continue till most of the city schools are covered,” said Sahay.
