HYDERABAD: Having decided to take on the ruling TRS, Telugu Desam Party is making arrangements to organise huge public meetings in every district in the state. Instead of walkathon, rallies and dharnas, the party wants to deploy all its resources on public meetings for better mileage to expose the government.

 Party state president   is busy holding discussions with district convenors and office-bearers to chalk out a schedule on the public meetings. He named these meetings as “Poru Bata“. “We have asked party cadre to identify 10 major issues to concentrate on by the party. The poll promises made by TRS before the elections have not been fulfilled and `Poru Bata' will spread the message among the public,“ L Ramana,  , told TOI. Party programmes and subject committee will finalise the 10 issues to be highlighted by the party and also venues of the public meetings. In a bid to expose the 'failures' of each department in getting sufficient funds from the Centre in the budget, the TDP delegations decided to meet   on February 6, 7 and 8. “We have got appointment with agriculture, social welfare and railway ministers and we will take this opportunity to demand more funds for the state,“ said Ramana.
 
 The TDP is also preparing to release a white paper on 'failures' of the TRS government in last 33 months. Demanding fee reimbursement for students, farm loan waiver for farmers, Aarogyasri funds for the poor, TDP leaders will meet district and mandal level officials. During his interaction with party office-bearers, Ramana complimented them for enrolling more than 7 lakh members in the party . He said the party will reach 10-lakh membership mark soon.
