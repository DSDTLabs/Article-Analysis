HYDERABAD: Those frequent fliers – who might have earned status of a globe-trotter in social circles – need to watch out for deep   ( ), a type of blood clot that is likely to occur in their legs while sitting immobile for hours.

 City doctors say that not just air travel, studies have shown that DVT can attack those using other mode of transports also, but its incidence is more for frequent fliers.
 
 The chances increase for those suffering from obesity, recent surgery, use of estrogen- containing contraceptives (birth control pills, rings, patches), hormone replacement therapy and pregnancy.
 
 “Due to limited movement of legs for longer duration during flights, the leg muscles cannot pump the blood to the heart, causing blood clots in the legs,” said Dr  , vascular and endovascular surgeon, KIMS hospitals.
 
 Two recent city cases, one with a long distance horse ride during a trip and a 50-year-old city-based woman techie diagnosed with DVT, three days after returning to the city from a long distance flight.
 
 The techie – who was on hormonal replacement therapy for post-menopausal syndrome – came to the doctor with leg pain, swelling and pain in her right leg.
 
 In the past, several researchers have established DVT’s links with frequent flyers with one major study by a team of city researchers selected 6,872 employees on long-haul flight of more than four hours and found that 53 employees had blood clot problem. In aggravated forms, untreated DVT may to lead to a serious condition called venous thromboembolism.
 
 The treatment for DVT includes use of blood thinners for 3-6 months or the patient may have to undergo a thrombolysis, a technique where blood clots are melted.
