NEW DELHI: The   on Thursday held that dissemination of forecast of poll results in any manner, including by political analysts, astrologers or tarot card readers, during the period of   ban was prohibited and amounted to violation of Section 126A of Representation of the People Act.

 Pointing to some TV channels that broadcast programmes projecting the numbers of seats likely to be won by political parties during recent polls,   said this was despite the provisions of Section 126A of the Representation of the People’s Act that ban dissemination of exit poll results between the start of   and the end of polling for the last phase.
 
 In its order issued on Thursday, EC made it clear that prediction of results of elections in any form, that is, by astrologers, tarot card readers or political analysts during the prohibited period was a violation of the spirit of Section 126A “which aims to prevent the electors of constituencies still going to polls from being influenced in their voting by such predictions about the prospects of various political parties”.
 
 “All media (electronic and print) are advised to refrain from telecasting/publishing similar programmes in future elections during the prohibited period under Section 126A to ensure free, fair and transparent election,” ruled EC.
 
 “...Such attempts... to score brownie points against the competitors for merely commercial reasons do not behove well,” it added.
