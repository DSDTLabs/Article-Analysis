Pune: The Alankar police on Saturday booked an administrative officer and three guards of the Deenanth Mangeshkar Hospital for thrashing a housekeeping department worker, suspecting his involvement in a theft of Rs500 and other articles from the facility.

 Sandip Phale (35) of Kothrud alleged in his complaint that after thrashing him with sticks, the suspects also forced to write a confession note stating he had committed the thefts. The police have booked the suspects under sections 324, 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Phale told TOI, “On Friday evening the guards hit me with sticks, inuring my back, hands and legs. I am unable to work because of the bruises.”
 
 The officer also alleged that I was responsible for the recent thefts at the hospital and forced me to write confessional statement, Phale said. 
 
 When contacted, Shirish Yadkikar, PRO, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, told TOI, “No such incident happened within the hospital premises. The allegations are baseless.”
