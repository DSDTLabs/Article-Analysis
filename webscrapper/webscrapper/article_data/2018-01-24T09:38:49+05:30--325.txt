CHANDIGARH: Barely 10 days after a room of girls’ hostel number 3 was gutted in a major fire, a minor fire broke out in a room on the same floor of the hostel on Tuesday morning. 

 The fire is suspected to have broken out when the occupant of the room, a research scholar in the botany department, lit an incense stick and threw the matchstick. After that, research scholars went to the canteen mess to have food and in the meantime, the wallpaper and mattress caught fire. The research scholar alerted hostel security and the fire was contained well in time. A fire brigade was also called but by then, the fire had been put out. 
 
 When asked what hostel authorities plan to do to prevent such incidents, warden of girls hostel number 3 Ravneet Kaur said, “Thankfully, the fire was controlled since the hosteller noticed it in time. I am certainly going to train my students on how to deal with such incidents since this is the second incident of fire in the hostel. It is important to tell students about the hazard.” She added that the wiring of the hostel is being checked. 
 
 By evening, the room was whitewashed and the burnt wallpaper was removed. Since the fire was controlled in time, there was no major loss. A suitcase and mattress were half-burnt and the wallpapers were completely destroyed. A few books and clothes also caught fire. 
 
 Dean, student welfare ( ) Prof   said the   is waiting for the report of the committee to ascertain the cause of the fire which broke out in the hostel on January 13. “We are waiting for the previous report and will take action after we evaluate it,” said Nahar.
 
 On January 13, a major fire burnt down in a room on the second floor of girls’ hostel number 3. The occupant of the room tried to douse the flames with water but it did not help since the magnitude of the fire was high. Hostel staff tried to use the fire extinguisher but could not.
