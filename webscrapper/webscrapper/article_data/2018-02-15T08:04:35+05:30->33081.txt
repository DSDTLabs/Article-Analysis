BHOPAL:   between Inter-State Bus Terminus (ISBT) and   is set to improve under the  . A new integration route has been envisaged to connect the two point for travellers.

 A travelator (walkway) measuring one kilometre between the ISBT and Habibganj railway station for seamless commuting is to be created, said an official of the   (BSCDCL).
 
 A planning assessment report recently stated that Bhopal has grown mostly in the south-east direction along the Hoshangabad Road. A connector linking the Habibganj railway station and ISBT would drastically reduce traffic congestion in the area.
 
 The walkway would be covered and officials are hopeful of roping in private participation for the project.
 
 “A route development scheme is also being put forth by the   (BCLL),” said BCLL director Keval Mishra. The two connects are expected to cater to over 50,000 passengers on a daily basis by the year 2020.
 
 Many civic body consultants have raised concerns over the demolition of a pedestrian pathway in the area. Construction undertaken by the public works department along the Chetak bridge will widen the road at the cost of the pathway.
