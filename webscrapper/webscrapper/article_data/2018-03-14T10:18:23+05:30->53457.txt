HYDERABAD: Wondering how the Centre and state simultaneously give two different notifications for acquiring the same land for expanding the existing national highway from Suryapet to   into a four-way lane, the Hyderabad High Court on Tuesday directed Telangana to stop acquiring land forthwith, and refrain from passing any consent awards for payment of compensation and dispossession. The Bench of ACJ Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K Vijaya Lakshmi was dealing with a public interest petition filed by   of   village in Khammam.

 Petitioner’s counsel B   told the court that when the poor farmers were heaving a sigh of relief after their representation to Union minister Nitin Gadkari was yielding some positive response, Telangana issued two notifications for acquiring the land for expansion of NH. They already gave their written objections over the acquisition and about change of alignments, she said.
 
 “Notwithstanding all this, the state began its process of repeatedly coercing, threatening and terrorising the ryots to sign ‘consent forms’ and acquire the land allegedly,” Rachna said. Even the district collector admits, in an   reply, that he has no knowledge about the acquisition by the state in the area and even refers the matter to the National Highways authority, she said.
 
 Advocate general   told the court that the state is interested to get things done in a speedy manner. “The Centre has agreed to entrust the matter to us, but somewhere confusion prevailed, and the Centre’s notification has not yet been withdrawn,” he said. He also hoped that the Centre would soon withdraw the notification to enable the state to go ahead. “But till then, central law prevails and hence the state needs to withdraw the notification,” the Bench said. “If the Centre refuses to withdraw, then either the state has to withdraw its notification or the court will have to nullify them,” the bench said and adjourned the case.
