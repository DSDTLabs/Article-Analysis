Although   has a lot on his plate, with his film 'Dunkirk' coming up, the ex-One Direction member managed to deliver his first album this month as a solo artiste. In the self-titled album, Styles has emulated his rock idols  ,  , Syd Barrett and other 1970s legends quite a bit. The 10-track album is an eclectic mix of ballads, blues and acoustic tracks and tries hard to portray Styles as a man who has lived it up and is now writing about it. The common subject here is, as one would have guessed it, women. 
But it seems he would need to live a little more to deliver something more concrete on the subject as far as song writing is concerned. There is actually a song titled 'Woman', with pop culture references and an addictive 70’s-pop vibe about a young woman, who has ditched Harry, and how he now bleeds. The acoustic ballad 'Sweet Creature' remains a stand-out track on the 40-minute long album. 'Sign of The Times' is another well-written song, which is again a ballad. 
 On 'Meet Me in the Hallway', you can totally hear 'Syd Barret’s' riffs from his song Late Night and a similar hallway-echo, which he used beautifully. But with Styles, you don’t hear that edge. If the young musician wants to portray himself as a solo rock star, there is a lot of grunge and living up to do before you can identify his sound. For now, this one packs just enough power to heal teenybopper hearts.
