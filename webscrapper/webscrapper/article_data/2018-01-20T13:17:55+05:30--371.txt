Panaji: Chief minister Manohar   on Friday said the installation of speed governors in transport vehicles was a central law and he couldn’t change it. 

 “February 24 is given as a special concession (to fit speed governors). There is a notice on the state government for contempt (of the SC order) but after February 24, we will not give fitness certificates if speed governors are not fitted,” he told reporters. 
 
 Parrikar said although the government has never threatened   operators, he has, however, made it very clear to them that he won’t allow violence. 
 
 “So far, no violence has been reported in the state... If anyone doesn’t want to ply his vehicle, it is his choice,” the chief minister said. 
 
 He also said the government received a letter from the taxi operators only informing that they would be staying off the road. There was no mention of their demands, he said. 
 
 Explaining that the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) was invoked to prevent any untowards incidents, Parrikar said if required, he could have forced some operators to ply their vehicles. “But just because I have the power, it doesn’t mean I have to use it. Power should be used only against those who resort to violence,” he said.
