Ahmedabad: Highlighting the importance of skilled manpower in the textile industry, chief secretary J N Singh hailed the Union government’s budgetary provision for textile industry and said it will help start-ups flourish. Singh was present at a discussion at the Indian Textile Global Summit 2018, on Saturday. “Skilled manpower is of utmost importance in the textile industry. The recent provision in the Union budget with the government providing subsidies for new employees in textile industry, will help start-ups in the textile industry grow,” said the state chief secretary. Singh also spoke about the garment policy and said it has been designed in a way to help the industry.  “The GIDC has already created necessary infrastructure with plug and play sheds to aid garment conversion industry. We are facilitating necessary infrastructure support for the garment manufacturers to be in the state. In fact, the state has a natural advantage with the entire textile value chain present here,” said Singh. “We hope that Gujarat also becomes a garment hub apart from being a textile hub. We will continue to support initiatives around this,” he added. He also spoke of several garment manufacturing units eyeing to set up facilities near Vapi and Ahmedabad.  “Six months down the line, these companies will be going around in a big way, thus aiding the industry at large,” Singh said.
