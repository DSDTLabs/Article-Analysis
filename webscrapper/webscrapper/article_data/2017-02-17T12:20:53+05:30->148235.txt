COIMBATORE: A   Coimbatore has used a  , considered a new generation valve, to replace a 76-year-old heart patient’s blocked  . 

 The use of a dry valve reduces the time taken for the procedure by a fourth and is considered safer to use, said doctors. The fact that this valve was introduced and placed just through a catheter, helped the patient avoid another open-heart surgery.
 
 A 76-year-old retired supervisor with the postal department came to Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital (KMCH) complaining of suffocation even if he walked briskly for just half an hour. 
 
 Cardiologists, who examined him, found that there were calcium deposits along his aortic valve, which was obstructing the flow of blood. 
 
 “We would have usually done an open heart surgery and replaced the aortic valve,” said consultant interventional cardiologist at the hospital, Dr Thomas Alexander. “But we did not want to because he had undergone a by-pass only in 2012, so healing would have taken longer and the surgery riskier,” he said.
 
 So, the doctors decided to try using a dry valve to replace the diseased aortic valve and through a catheter, to make the process as risk free and fast as possible. 
 
 “The dry valve, manufactured by a US-based company, is small in size hardly 29 mm making it more suitable to Indians’ who have smaller and thinner arteries,” said Dr Alexander. 
 
 “It is also more advanced because it is a pre-packaged, pre-crimped, pre-mounted valve,” said cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Prashant Vaijyanath. 
 
 “It helps save time because it does not need to be cleaned off the Glutaraldehyde solution that wet valves are kept in and it does not need to be crimped,” he said. 
 
 “The procedure that takes an hour was completed in 15 minutes,” he said.
