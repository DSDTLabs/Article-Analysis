MANGALURU: Chennamma Kuteera in Bantwal is the place to go to for Congress candidates before they file their nomination.

 The residence of veteran Congress leader Janardhana Poojary, 80, has seen quite a few surprise visitors in the last two days.
 
 For long a political pariah, Poojary now finds himself in the thick of politics in the district. A few years ago, this development would not have come as a surprise when the former Union minister was energetic and active, but after his loss in the Lok Sabha election in 2014, he was totally sidelined. His outspokenness and rants against the CM, only made matters worse. He was even asked to take the ‘Primary’, in the 2014 Lok Sabha election to get a ticket against Harsha Moily, son of former Union minister M Veerappa Moily, which he eventually won, but lost the polls to BJP’s Nalin Kumar Kateel.
 
 He was not on the dais at AICC president Rahul Gandhi’s Janashirvad Yatra at Nehru Maidan on March 20. But Rahul met him at Sri Gokarnanatha Temple the same day.
 
 With the announcement of the assembly election, tables have turned. As a close aide of Poojary summed it up: it is the Billava votes that is making them queue outside his house and ‘seek his blessings’.
 
 Candidates who met the leader in the past couple of days include district minister B Ramanath Rai,  , a native of Puttur and a candidate from Kaup constituency in Udupi district, Vasanth Bangera from Belthangady, B A   from Mangaluru City North and   from Mangaluru City South.
 
 “Poojary being a tall leader has been blessing them without rancor. Such is his greatness,’’ added the aide. When contacted Poojary, said: “They have come to seek my   for the party and themselves and I have blessed them.”
 
 “Congress has always respected Poojary. Rahul personally met him during his recent visit. Poojary will be our guide forever,”said MLA B A Mohiuddin Bava.
