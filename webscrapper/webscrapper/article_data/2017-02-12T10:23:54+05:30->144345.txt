AURANGABAD: The civic body is all set to introduce a novel concept of a 1.5-km   between   and Aurangabad caves in order to attract tourists and cycling enthusiasts.

 “The   (AMC) would develop a 24-meter road passing through the Maqbara towards the caves that will have footpaths as well as the cycle track,” AMC executive engineer   said on Saturday.
 
 “Municipal commissioner   Bakoria, who conceptualised the development of the roads with cycle track, has asked us to speed up the work. For this purpose, the AMC has roped in Dheeraj Deshmukh, a well-known architect attached to the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), to prepare the plan. It would certainly help boost tourism, as lakhs of tourists visit the Maqbara and ancient Aurangabad caves,” he added.
 
 The caves are located on a hill running roughly east to west, nearly 2 km behind Bibi Ka Maqbara. A total of 12 Buddhist Caves are found here which fall into three separate groups- that have been carved between 2nd and 7th century AD, while the Maqbara is the mausoleum of Rabia-ul-Daurani alias Dilras Banu Begum — wife of the Mughal emperor Aurangazeb.
 
 “It would be a two-lane road with 7.5 meters on each side with storm water drainage and a footpath along with an extended 1.5-km long cycle track. The civic body will have to acquire some land, for which we could give FSI or TDR facility. The process would not be time-consuming as the FSI and TDR could be finalised instantly. The process is expected to begin within a month,” he said.
