 will begin the sales of a   tale by 10-year-old   next month, after the school boy won its bedtime story competition. What's more, all the proceeds from the book will go to  .

 The Bedtime Story Competition 2017 had children participating between the ages of 5 and 11 who were asked to write a story on the theme of friendship. The prize was won by Frasier Cox from Brighton whose story, 
  was chosen from more than 1,300 entries.
 
 The book was praised to be “incredibly touching and thought provoking” by TV presenter and judge Claudia Winkleman. “It’s absolutely remarkable that a young boy has written such a thoughtful story and I can’t wait to see the final version when it’s released," she said.
 
 A 9-year-old   wrote the story in the form of a poem. It's about a hypothetical friendship between a boy from England and a refugee. The story sees the boy thinking about their similarities and realising that both children are essentially same and it's only their circumstances that are different. 
 
 Frasier worked with Alison Brown, an illustrator, and a children's book publisher   to turn his story into a book, which will be on sale from The Book People’s website next month.
