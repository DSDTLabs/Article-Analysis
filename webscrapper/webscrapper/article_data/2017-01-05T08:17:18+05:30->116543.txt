LUCKNOW: Stalemate continued in   despite its patriarch  's   and senior UP minister   trying to broker peace between the warring factions all through Wednesday .

 Showing no signs of reconciliation, Akhilesh revoked the sacking of four district chiefs who were removed by Shivpal for attending the Sunday covention where Akhilesh was anointed as the national president.
 
 He has also called a meeting of some select ministers and MLAs at his residence on Thursday morning to give final touches to his party's election strategy. The day began with Azam, who had earlier played a peacemaker and persuaded Akhilesh to meet Mulayam after the latter sacked the chief minister from the party on Friday, holding a three hour long meeting with the SP patriach at his residence. After another round of meeting with Mulayam, Azam met Akhilesh before he reached Mulayam's residence along with sitting SP MP Dharmendra Yadav for another round of talks. However, the exercise failed to yield any results as the two sides refused to budge from their stand.
 
 Azam Khan is learnt to have tried hard to convince the two sides for a truce explaining how the minority vote bank was shifing away from the SP because of the feud in the Yadav clan but to no avail.
 
 Meanwhile there were no signs of any early ruling from the Election Commission of India before which the two sides have staked claim over the party and the symbol. Dismissing reports of possibilities that the ECI may freeze the SP's election symbol, Chief Election Commissioner Nasim Zaidi described it as hypothetical.
 
 “Any query on freezing of Samajwadi Party poll symbol 'cycle' is hypothetical right now,“ Zaidi said in Delhi as he announced the schedule for assembly elections in five states including UP.
 
 “Let us first examine the documents submitted by both the groups,“ Zaidi said, referring to claims by warring factions of the Samajwadi Party led by its chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister  .
