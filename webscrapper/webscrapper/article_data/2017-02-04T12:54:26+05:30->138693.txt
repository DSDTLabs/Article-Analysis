BAREILLY/PILIBHIT: Union minister of state   was left disappointed on Friday as he was unable to cast his vote in   because his name was missing from the voters’ list.
 
  Several others also alleged that their names were in the voters' list during the graduate MLC elections in 2015 but now their names are missing.
  
  “I had submitted all the forms on time but even then I was not able to vote. It was really disappointing. I will definitely order an inquiry in the matter,” Gangwar said.
  
  There are eight graduate   in UP and elections are due in three of these as the seats are going to fall vacant soon. Apart from the election on one seat in Bareilly-Moradabad divisions, the other two seats where polling is due are in Kanpur division and   divisions.
  
  An estimated 33% electorate exercised their franchise. This time 11 contestants are in fray including BJP’s sitting MLC Jaypal Singh ‘Vyast’, Congress’s K K Gangwar and nine independents.
  
  Similarly, Pilibhit recorded 38.71% polling. According to the additional district magistrate (finance and revenue), A K Saini, the overall percentage of polling at 10am was 2.62%, 11.87% at 12 noon, 25.62% at 2pm and 38.71% at 4pm.
  
  Counting of votes will be held on February 6.
