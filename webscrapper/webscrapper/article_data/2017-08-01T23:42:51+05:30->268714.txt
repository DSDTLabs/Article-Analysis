Mapusa: The new service road built along the national highway 17 (NH 17) near the   junction in   is in a dilapidated condition.

 This new service road caters to heavy traffic diverted onto it due to the ongoing four-laning work of the NH 17. TOI also observed that potholes have surfaced on the road making it difficult for the motorists. A number of traffic jams were also witnessed on the road due to the diversion of traffic. Locals have alleged that the bad condition of the road could cause accidents if the potholes are not repaired and rectified in time. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, convener of Aldona block Congress Ashwin de Souza said that Mapusa has been “the capital of potholes” for the last few years and the only place left was the highway. 
 
 “It didn’t take much time for the inefficient government authorities to create a life-threatening situation on the stretch. Commuters have to deal with the inconvenience for no fault of theirs and the government should be held responsible in case of fatalities,” he said. 
 
 Another local resident from Moira also highlighted that the road is in a pathetic condition and added that two-wheeler riders were the ones who suffer the most due to this problem.
 
 “When it rains, the service road is full of water and it becomes difficult to spot the potholes. Hence we have to ride cautiously to avoid landing into the potholes,” said the resident. 
 
 When TOI contacted the executive engineer, works division 7, national highway, Narayan Mayekar, he said that the repair works of the road have already begun.
 
 “We have started doing the repair and asphalting work on the new service road during the dry spell. My workers are working around-the-clock to undertake the repairs of the road,” he said. Mayekar further added that the works will be completed before the commencement of the Ganesh Chaturthi festival.
