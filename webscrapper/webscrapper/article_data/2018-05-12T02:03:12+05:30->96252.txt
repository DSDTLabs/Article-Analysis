GURUGRAM: Mushrooming of commercial properties on   has become a serious concern for the department of town and country planning ( ). Nearly 100 big and small stores have come up illegally on 33   situated in   1, amid confusion that parts of the area are commercial.

 DTCP is planning to issue notices to these properties and take action against some dealers who spread rumours that there is departmental permission for commercial properties on the stretch. A senior official of DTCP said, “The department has received several complaints regarding illegal commercial activities in Block A of DLF 1. The property owners have developed commercial establishments on residential plots without any permissions.” 
 
 He further said the property owners are earning huge rentals from these establishments in nexus with some officials of the enforcement wing. There are 29 plots in lane 14 of DLF 1, and 14 plots in lane 16, where owners have developed commercial properties. 
 
 These include showrooms, salons, clinics, educational institutes and others. When TOI spoke to these showroom owners, they said the property dealers in the area had told them that parts of Golf Course Road have been declared commercial zones.
 
 Rajendra Sharma, district town planner (enforcement), said some property dealers have been spreading rumours about commercialisation of Golf Course Road, though the department has no such plans. “We have served showcause notices to one of the buildings on A 14 lane and directed the owner to restore the building to its original status,” he said. 
 
 The department has also conducted a survey in DLF 2 and identified illegal commercial properties, which are now likely to face action within a week, said an official.
