Vadodara: An elderly woman was cheated by two unidentified persons by taking away her gold bangles worth Rs 30,000 in Gorwa on Tuesday.

 Pushpa Patel, a resident of Gorwa, told the police in her complaint that two unidentified persons came to her house on Tuesday afternoon as salesman of a washing powder company. When Patel, a widow, refused to buy the powder, the accused insisted on showing her a demo.
 
 They asked her to put her two bangles in a bowl of hot water and asked her to get turmeric. Police said that when she went inside the kitchen to bring turmeric, the duo allegedly changed her gold bangles with duplicate ones.
 
 Patel realized that she had been cheated after the two left from her place.
