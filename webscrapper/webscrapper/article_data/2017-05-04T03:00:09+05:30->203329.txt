NEW DELHI: Around 100   lots of the Delhi   may be handed over to   or municipal corporation for operations. Speaking at the foundation day of the Delhi Metro on Wednesday, Delhi LG Anil Baijal made this announcement.

 Addressing the 23rd Foundation Day, Baijal said DMRC has taken an in-principle decision to execute the proposal. However, he didn’t elaborate on the details or timeline of the decision. The final decision will be taken by authorities concerned, including the Centre and the Delhi government, which hold equal equity in DMRC.
 
 Baijal stressed on the need of last-mile connectivity in the city and parking space at and near metro stations. “In the meeting on Tuesday, we had a preliminary discussion on parking spaces that are available with Delhi Metro. If DMRC are not able to develop them, I would like it to hand it over to DDA or municipal corporations,” he said.
 
 He said the corporations and DDA could take up construction work of the parking spaces once the final decision is taken. “We will work out the details, but the beginning was made on Tuesday. I congratulate DMRC MD for having taken this decision in-principle,” Baijal said.
 
 Of the 160 Metro stations, around 100 parking lots are managed by Delhi Metro. “One is efficient last-mile connectivity (the paratransit system) and the second is reasonable parking space and near Metro stations,” the LG said, adding that good traffic management should also be in place at Metro stations.
 
 Baijal also spoke about DMRC’s achievement in getting the entire electricity requirement of the Phase-III development met by solar power.
 
 Delhi Metro MD Mangu Singh highlighted various initiatives taken by DMRC in the past year. At the function, the Chandni Chowk Metro station was adjudged the ‘best metro station’.
