NEW DELHI: The capital’s first modern pig   and   processing plant is coming up in west Delhi’s   area.

 Though   has a mechanised slaughterhouse, only buffalo, sheep and goat are slaughtered there. “There is no slaughterhouse for pigs in Delhi, and pork sellers have been killing the animals in the open without disposing off by products that pose a health hazard. The new abattoir for which consultancy tender has been issued will not only regulate slaughter but also include a processing plant,” said the director of veterinary services, North Delhi Municipal Corporation.
 
 The idea was conceived in 2009 but was delayed due to unavailability of land. “The case went to Supreme Court in 2013, and it was only in 2015 that   allotted land in Rani Khera,” the official added. 
 
 The civic bodies estimate Delhi’s daily pork consumption is about 1.2 lakh kilos and requires the slaughter of up to 2,000 pigs. “These shops are scattered all over Delhi. Our role now is to issue challans if the pork is found to be in an insanitary condition. In the Rani Khera facility, we will have everything from pig-rearing hutments to meat processing at one place. This streamlining of the slaughter business would also prevent any outbreak of diseases like swine flu in pigs,” the official said. 
 
 The corporation would relocate pig-rearing units to the new site in phases.
 
 The estimated cost would be up to Rs 300 crore, and the project might take four years to complete. Since it’s cost-intensive, the corporation plans to do it on a PPP model in the long run, unlike the Ghazipur facility that was set up by the erstwhile MCD. However, the civic body has been facing stiff resistance from Rani Khera locals who don’t want the abattoir in their area.
