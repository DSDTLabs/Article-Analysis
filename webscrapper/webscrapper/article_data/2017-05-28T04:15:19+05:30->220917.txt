GURUGRAM: A brother-sister duo, originally from  , has been arrested with the police claiming to have busted a major interstate gang that has been active across NCR and committed numerous thefts and burglaries over the past one decade or so. 

 The police said the gang, comprising both men and women, all from a Madhya Pradesh village, used to carry out a detailed recce before targeting a big house in upscale localities. Then, they used to wait for the “right time” to break into a house and steal ornaments and other valuables. Thereafter, the women members of the gang used to go back to their village in MP, sell off the booty and distribute the share among themselves. 
 
 The breakthrough came when a police team from the Bilaspur crime unit rounded up Rampujan Pardi, originally from Guna in MP, who was roaming on Kherki Daula with a gun, on May 17. 
 
 During interrogation, Rampujan, who carried a reward of Rs 25,000 on his head, confessed to his involvement in more than 40 cases of theft, burglary, robbery, dacoity and murder. He also revealed that his sister, Sulochana, was hand in glove with him. Based on the inputs given by him, a team of the city police went to Guna and arrested Sulochana on Thursday. 
 
 “We have arrested her and brought to the city for interrogation,” said inspector Surender Kumar, in charge of crime unit, Bilaspur.
