Navi Mumbai: The standing committee of the   (NMMC) has deducted Rs 93 crore of the Rs 290 crore allocated by the civic body meant for construction of animal hospital, slaughter house, public toilets, installation of CCTVs and fire extinguishers in NMMC schools.

 The deduction has been done in order to appropriate funds for projects to be undertaken in the next fiscal. 
 
 Fund allocation of 22 odd works was reduced by the committee on Tuesday prior to giving its approval for the   to be presented before the general body. The committee’s budgetary allocation has come after three days of extended discussions and suggestions. “The income projection by merely inflating the tax recovery target itself is senseless and followed by this was the re-appropriation of funds made against development work. At a time when security is of major concern to citizens, instead of allocating more funds for CCTVs, the committee has reduced the allocation from Rs 630 crore projected by NMMC to Rs 500 crore. A sterilisation centre has now become a necessity, but even funds meant for it have been reduced from Rs 6 crore to Rs 3 crore. The solar project from which there is no expected income is being revived by the committee with an allocation of Rs 90 crore raising questions on its priorities,” said Sena leader and member of committee Dwarkanath Bhoir.
 
 Two projects scrapped by then civic chief  , (hospital on wheels named Floating Advanced Casualty Complex (FACC) and 20MB electricity generated through solar power) have been revived by the committee.
 
 Both these projects were termed not feasible and therefore set aside by Mundhe. Even in the budget estimates, the NMMC had restrained from making any major allocation to these projects. “A call on whether these projects can be taken up further will be done after proper study,” said civic chief Dr Ramaswamy N.
