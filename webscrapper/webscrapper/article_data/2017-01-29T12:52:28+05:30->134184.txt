NAGPUR: A world record of making 111 forms of   with rangoli was set by   on Saturday.   has awarded Supriya for making 111 rangolis in 84 hours. The previous record was of 106 rangolis. 

 The exhibition was inaugurated by Deepali Masirkar, deputy commissioner of police, at Raja Ravi Verma Art Gallery, South Central Zone Cultural Centre (SCZCC), Civil Lines. “India is a country full of talent. Supriya will inspire many to set such records,” said Masirkar.
 
 Supriya made rangolis on a plywood with the images of Ganesha. “It was my attempt to worship Lord Ganesha as I am his devotee,” said Supriya. “Designing rangoli on a plywood is very hectic and tedious than making it on the floor. We have to be very careful while moving plywood from one place to another,” added Supriya.
 
 The rangoli exhibition will be open to public from 10am to 8pm till Tuesday 31. 
 
 The work of Supriya was evaluated by   from World Record of India. A memento, medal and certificate was presented to Supriya by Patil for her extraordinary work. “For creating a world record, passion and a little craziness is needed. Records are not set by ordinary people,” said Patil. 
 
 The work of Supriya has also been sent to Guinness Book of World Records for recognition. Madhukar Fulare, Babarao Shinde and Anup Satpati were present at the inaugural function. 
 
 Talking to TOI, Supriya said, “It is hard for an artist to choose this field as a source of income. But artists must work for social cause and not money.” Supriya had organized various programmes to help blind children improve their artistic skills.
