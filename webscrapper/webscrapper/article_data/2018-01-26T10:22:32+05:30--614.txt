CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Thursday issued notice to the Punjab government on a plea seeking directions for setting aside the process of wards’ delimitation of   ( ) Ludhiana.

 A Division bench headed by Justice Mahesh Grover issued the notice after hearing a petition filed by local MLAs, Simarjeet Singh Bains, his brother Balwinder Singh Bains and others. According to the petitioners, the delimitation process of   was illegal, arbitrary and in complete violation of the   Order, 1995.
 
 Petitioners informed the court that the state authorities had already decided to increase the numbers of wards in the MC from 75 to 95 and to achieve its ‘nefarious designs’, the authorities conducted a door-to-door survey of population in the MC limits.
 
 “In the survey, some wards witnessed an increase of 50 to 70% cent population, other wards found decrease of more than 50 %. Only six years had lapsed since the population census was conducted in 2011. The MC’s territorial limits had not witnessed any natural calamity, exodus or influx of the population for last six years. The unexpected increase and decrease of population in the wards as shown in the population survey was completely illegal and done in an arbitrary manner with a motive to eventually affect the voter list of each ward”, argued the petitioners. Some of the petitioners have also argued that ward number 84 had been wrongly declared as schedule caste ward after ignoring the real facts, population census and the draft notification issued on December 21, 2017. It was submitted that the ward has a total population of around 12000, out of which around 8900 belong to general category and approximately 3000 belong to the scheduled caste (SC). It was argued that the false survey was conducted increasing the SC and backward class population to convert the ward from general to SC category. The matte would now come up for further hearing on February 5.
