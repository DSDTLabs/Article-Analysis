LUCKNOW: The   that began on Monday were not without glitches, with   being reported from the centre at   in Chowk. The centre in charge asked the invigilator to write the questions on the black board and also dictate them to students. 

 On opening the packets of   of 'Shia Deeniyat', Saket Saurabh, principal of Agrasen Inter College, one of the 11 centres for madrassa board exams in the city, found only 10 question papers in each pack of 40.
 
 On the cover of the sealed packets, it was written with black pen that the packet contains 40 question papers. The principal intimated the examination in charge who asked him to deal with the situation by getting the questions written on black board.
 
 The invigilators were seen writing the questions on black board and also dictating them to the examinees. 
 
 A few students at the same centre were also unable to appear in the examination since their admit card carried incorrect details. 
 
 "I am a first year 'Fazil' student, but the admit card I got in the morning for my second shift examination, says second year student. When I reached the centre, I was sent back and not allowed to sit in the exam. When I contacted the control room, no one paid attention initially and then the Board consoled me of doing something about it later," said an examinee.
