GUWAHATI: A woman BJP politician from Assam, who was an active campaigner against triple talaq, has been suspended from the party on charge of supporting issues relating to atrocities against Rohingiyas of   on social media without taking prior permission.

 Benazir Arfan (30) claimed her suspension was “arbitrary” as she was not asked for any explanation and also without calling any prior disciplinary meeting.
 
 “Look at the irony of life. I being a victim of triple talaq, all along been campaigning in support of   government’s stand against triple talaq. Now my own party with which I have been associated for many years, has spelt the talaq on me," Benazir, a civil engineer by profession and executive member of BJP’s  , said.
 
 A suspension order signed by BJP general secretary Dilip Saikia said that Benazir without taking prior permission from the party, appealed through social media about making successful a "hunger strike" programme against “problem in Myanmar” organised by another organization.
 
 “As this is against party’s principle and ideal, BJP state president Ranjit Kumar Das has instructed the suspension and relieving her from all responsibilities of the party,” the order stated.
 
 Benazir said that United Minority People’s Forum (UMPF) organized a prayer meeting here for Rohingiyas who were killed in Myanmar on Saturday.
 
 "My mistake was that I inadvertently wrote the word protest instead of prayer meeting on social media. I owned my mistake, and I think this is a minor error I committed. But I am really saddened by the fact that the party which I served for years, did not give me even a chance to explain. I got a message on my whatsapp that I have been suspended," Benazir, who contested on BJP ticket and lost from   constituency in last year’s assembly polls said.
