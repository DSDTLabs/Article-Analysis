India will hope Leander Paes’ bid for the   record proves to be the inspiration and not a distraction when they take on a formidable China in the Asia-Oceania Group 1 second-round tie in Tianjin on Friday and Saturday. The draw on Thursday pitted India’s No. 1 player   against the host’s rising star, 18-year-old Yibing Wu, in the opening singles followed by Sumit Nagal against Ze Zhang in the second rubber.

 
 
 
 On Saturday, Paes will share the court with Rohan Bopanna against Mao-Xing Gong and Di Wu in the doubles rubber, which will be followed by the reverse singles. “Good to have Ram starting. He has a lot more experience than Yibing Wu does, so he has to execute,” captain   said from Tianjin.
 
 
 
 “Conditions are brutal for all players. So whoever stays mentally stronger will benefit,” he added, referring to the extreme cold in China’s north-eastern city, where the temperature has been hovering around 6 degrees.
 
 A year is a long time in sports and it has proved to be so for the trio of Paes, Bhupathi and Bopanna. Around the same time last year, Bhupathi benched Paes for the tie against Uzbekistan in Bengaluru, sparking yet another episode of washing the dirty linen in public. Now, the non-playing captain hasn’t been left with much of a choice but to pair Paes with Bopanna as the two are the only doubles specialists in the team.
 
 With Yuki Bhambri pulling out due to injury, the Indians don’t enjoy the almost-guaranteed two singles points. Thus, doubles holds the key to India’s chances. Should India win the doubles, Paes will go past Italian Nicola Pietrangeli, with whom he is tied on 42 for the most doubles wins in the tournament’s history.
