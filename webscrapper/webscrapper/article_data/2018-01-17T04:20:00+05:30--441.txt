Vadodara: A senate member from M S University’s Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) has demanded action against deputy registrar (exam) for his alleged failure in discharging his duties related to examination work at the faculty.  Senate member Nikul Patel has submitted a complaint to MSU vice-chancellor (VC) professor Parimal Vyas demanding that a show cause notice should be issued to deputy registrar (exam) Darshan Maru for his alleged inefficiency.  The senate member has also demanded that a committee should be constituted to probe the reasons why the university’s exam section has failed to provide remuneration to internal and external examiners at FTE since last four semesters.  According to Patel, the exam section has not paid due remuneration to the examiners at FTE since last two years. In fact, the senate member has alleged that recently an external examiner had returned a bundle of answer books as he has not received the remuneration since last two years. “Although the bundle of answer books of exam which was conducted on November 22 had returned to the university on November 30 for more than one month it was lying at the university examination section unattended. It is because of this negligence that results of students are getting delayed,” he said, adding that the delay in providing remuneration to examiners is also ruining the image of the university.
