Superstar  , who is awaiting the release of ‘Kaala’, is all set to team up with filmmaker   for his forthcoming big-budget project. To be produced on a massive scale by Sun Pictures, the yet-untitled film is currently in its pre-production stage. Now, rumours are rife that actress   is being considered to play the leading lady in the film. However, nothing has been finalised yet. 

 Prior to this, names of heroines like   and Anjali were doing the rounds. Interestingly, Trisha has acted with almost all the top heroes in Tamil cinema except Rajinikanth. Last week, Karthik Subbaraj met Rajinikanth at his residence to discuss the film and his call sheet. If reports are anything to go by, the film's shoot is expected to go on floors in August.
 
 On the other hand, it isn’t clear whether ‘Kaala’ will release as planned on April 27. Reports say that the makers might push the release to the ongoing strike in the industry. Rajinikanth’s highly anticipated ‘2.0’ has also been postponed yet again. The film, directed by  , is likely to hit screens later this year.
