BENGALURU: Over 15,000 children, mostly from the economically weaker sections, will have an opportunity to watch  's men in action against Australia during the second Test, beginning at the M   on March 4, free of cost.

 Around 5,000 children will be invited on each of the last three days of the five-day contest as there has been a great demand for tickets from the public for the first two days (Saturday and Sunday).
 
 “We are in touch with an event management company and an NGO to coordinate with schools. As many as 5,000 seats at the A Upper, B and C Lower stands will be earmarked for the children," KSCA official spokesperon   told TOI.
 
 KSCA will provide food apart from providing pick-up-and-drop facility. "Some schools will make their own transport arrangements but for the rest of the children we will approach KSRTC for transportation. We will also provide them snacks and drinking water facilities," Mruthyunjaya said adding that have already identified the schools and will take final call shortly.
 
 In November 2015, when Bengaluru hosted the Freedom Series Test match between India-South Africa, KSCA had invited over 25,000 underprivileged children over five days (5,000 children a day) but the contest was washed out after first day's play.
 
 Delhi too followed a similar practice, inviting around 8,000 schoolchildren to fill up the stands during the fourth Test of the same series. Justice (retd) Mukul Mudgal, who was appointed observer for the match, introduced the measure. “This attracted more spectators to the match, leading to a proper atmosphere was created for a pulsating Test,” Mudgal told TOI, while appreciating KSCA’s gesture inviting 15,000 schoolchildren for the second Test.
