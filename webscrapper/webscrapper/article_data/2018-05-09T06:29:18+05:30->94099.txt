PATNA: Two persons were stabbed to death and another suffered serious injuries when they resisted the criminals’ bid to loot them along the railway track near Kathpul between   and Rajendra Nagar Terminal at around 5 am on Tuesday.

 
 One of the deceased was identified as Rudal Yadav (32) while another one in his late 30s was found dead in the women’s coach of Patna-Gaya passenger train soon after it reached Patna Junction at around 6.15am from the railway yard near Kathpul. Rudal’s friend   (26) suffered multiple stab wounds and was undergoing treatment at a local hospital. Both Rudal and Rambhu belonged to Chitti in Madhepura district. 
 
 They worked in Punjab as daily wagers and had reached Patna from Ludhiana by Amritsar-Howrah Express at around 4.30am. They were walking along the railway track to Rajendra Nagar Terminal to board   when the criminals intercepted them near Kathpul and looted Rs11,000 from each of them along with their mobile phones. When they resisted their loot bid, criminals stabbed them, Superintendent of rail police (SRP), Patna, Ashok Kumar quoted Rambhu while explaining the incident.
 
 The SRP said the stab marks on the man’s body found in the Patna-Gaya passenger train were similar to those of Rudal and Rambhu, indicating that the unidentified deceased tried to take shelter in the coach after getting stabbed by the same criminals near Kathpul, he added. “A railway ticket from Gaya to Patna of Monday was also recovered from the unidentified body,” he said.
