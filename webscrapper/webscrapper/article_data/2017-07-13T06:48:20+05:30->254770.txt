CHENNAI: Twenty days after NEET (National Eligibility Entrance Exam) results were announced, CBSE has not declared state-wise marks specifics.

 Just a week ahead of medical counselling in  , students have no idea about cut-offs and don’t know where they stand among the 32,570 who qualified.
 
 The state has announced it would reserved 85% of seats for state board students, but people like Chennai resident Santhosh G, in the 300-mark range, are still confused. “While I know I qualify for admission, I don’t know if I can get a government college seat. In case I don’t qualify, I have to arrange money for a private college. 
 
 The process has been very stressful. Especially for those in the 200-300 range, as we can’t even weigh how the competition is,” he said. Several others seem to be willing to join a reputed engineering college rather than wait and settle for a low-tier  
 
 A minuscule few like   can breathe easy. Having scored over 600 marks, he qualifies for all-India counselling despite only 15% seats under its ambit. But Arun admits most of his friends remain stressed ahead of counselling on July 17.
 
 Neither CBSE nor MCI has published results on a public portal, and the   and education departments have been unable to furnish details. “We are yet to get details like cut-offs or number of students in marks range,” a health department official said.
