SSS Shameem,   at the   (MIT), will set off on a   from May 15 starting from Okha (Gujarat) to Dibrugarh (Assam) – that is about 3,500km -- in 20 days.

 Shameem has earlier attempted a solo cycling journey from Kanyakumari to Kashmir (3,500 km) in 23 days (summer-2016); the Campus Connect “Tour-de-Manipal” ( ) from Manipal to Jaipur (2,500 km in 20 days) in the winter of 2016). He is taking up the expedition to spread the message of unity and humanity in a greener and healthier way. This is part of his ‘Bharat-Bhraman’ campaign.
 
 Shameem, the son of SK Habibun Bibi and SK Anwar Hossain, says he is a Muslim by birth; Indian by heart, human by nature; professor by profession; family person by emotion; trier and achiever by determination. He is a regular endurance athlete, still far away from a podium finish, but with a vast experience of many half-marathons, full-marathons, 200/300/400 km cycling brevets; apart from regular rigorous training sessions.
 
 During this journey, he will pass through six states and UTs, 39 districts, and 40 (major) cities; and some sensitive stretches in UP, Bihar, West Bengal, and Assam. “The expedition is being undertaken in peak summer and as I am all alone, the race against time and distance will be a herculean task. Other than the weather, the fact that I will have to manage every aspect of this journey for 20-odd days on my own is a challenge,” he said.
 
 He hopes to cycle 170-200 km per day. He said he has prepared hard for this and would try to complete the journey.
