 reveals she has said some prayers for the accountant, who handed out the wrong envelope to Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway during the best picture announcement at this year's Oscars. 

 The shocking mix-up at the 89th   saw 'La La Land' mistakenly read out as the winner of the best picture instead of Barry Jenkins' 'Moonlight'. 
 
  
  
  accountant Brian Cullinan wrongly handed out the envelope for the best actress in a leading role - which went to   for her performance in the Damien Chazelle's musical-- instead of the best picture. 
 
 The 46-year-old star says she felt nothing but sympathy for Brian who along with his colleague Martha Ruiz, has been banned from next year's Oscars ceremony. 
 
 "It was exhilarating and fun. I  , it was a lot of firsts that night. Janelle was in 'Moonlight' and didn't realise they had won. I'm like, 'You gotta get up there, you guys won.' I really felt for the 'La La Land' people, but they had won all night. The guy that gave the envelope, I really said some prayers for him because he is the one that really just, like, that was bad. It was kinda sad," Spencer says on a popular TV show.
