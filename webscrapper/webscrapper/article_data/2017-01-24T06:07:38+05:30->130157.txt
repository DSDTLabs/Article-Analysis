LUCKNOW:   (SP) member Naresh Agarwal demanded on Monday that fellow MP   resign from the   following reports that he had tied up with   to secure a ticket for his son Rakesh Verma.

  Agarwal said if Beni was unhappy with SP he should resign his Rajya Sabha seat.
 
 Interestingly, the demand for Beni’s resignation came amid speculations that Agarwal himself was set to join BJP. “There is no question of my leaving SP,” Agarwal reacted to the speculations, adding that such reports were being planted by his rivals. “I am with our party president   and we will uproot BJP in the electoral battle,” he told TOI. He admitted meeting Union home minister   but described the meeting as “personal”.
 
 Beni had sought a ticket for Rakesh from Ramnagar in Barabanki. But Akhilesh has fielded sitting MLA and minister Arvind Singh Gope from that seat and offered Kaiserganj seat to Rakesh which he turned down.
