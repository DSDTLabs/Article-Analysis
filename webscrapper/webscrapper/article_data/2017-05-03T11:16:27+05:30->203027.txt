BENGALURU: The  , which signed a Rs50-crore deal with the state government for a 25-acre land in   to set up its  , is now looking to acquire an additional 25 acres adjacent to it.

 At the   committee meeting chaired by   here on Tuesday, members decided to approach the government for additional land. "All the formalities for the transfer of land to   have been completed. Now we are looking for an additional 25 acres adjacent to the new property to set up a state-of-the-art cricket academy," Shah told TOI.
 
 The board is keen on shifting the NCA to the new location because of lack of space at the Chinnaswamy stadium, where it is currently located. "We want to create a high-performance centre on the lines of those in Brisbane and England. An additional 25 acres will help," the veteran cricket administrator said, adding that the members would approach the government in the coming days.
 
 Shah said his committee is in talks with experts to draw a blueprint for the facility. "We are in talks with engineers, architects and other experts to design the facility. We are hoping the plan will be in place in the next two months. Once that is done, we will start the construction of the academy," he said.
 
 Apart from the land deal, the members were also updated on the NCA's cricket programmes conducted since January and the ongoing camps at the zonal cricket Academies.
