GURUGRAM: MCG officials on Wednesday sealed seven   and lawns used for marriage and other parties, over non-payment of  , in a drive that was launched on Tuesday with a crackdown on four other such properties in the city.

 The properties sealed on Wednesday include   (with tax   of Rs 1.26 lakh), Shriram Vatika (Rs 1.86 lakh), Krishna Manglam Garden (Rs 20.18 lakh),   (Rs 10.23 lakh), Vishal Garden (Rs 18.56 lakh), Blessing Garden (Rs 20 lakh) and Sagun Garden (Rs 20 lakh).
 
 On Tuesday, MCG had sealed four banquet halls —   (Rs 10.8 lakh dues), Shyam Garden (Rs 32.25 lakh), Lotus Garden (Rs 4.43 lakh) and Yadav Garden (Rs 3.40 lakh) — even as owners of three other halls made on-the-spot payments to settle pending dues and evade action.
 
 “It is mandatory for all residential and commercial properties under MCG to pay tax. If the tax is not paid, MCG can impose penalty/interest for delayed payment, seal or attach the property, and even auction it to recover the dues,” said MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav.
 
 He said all the banquet halls were issued notice in February, asking them to clear their dues by March 31 or brace for action. “Owners of some of the banquet halls paid their tax. The sealing drive is being carried out against those who have not paid their dues. The drive will continue,” he added.
 
 Gurugram has 63 banquet halls and lawns, of which 34 are situated within the 300-metre radius of the ammunition depot of Indian Air Force. Moreover, most of the 63 halls are located on Old Delhi-Gurugram Road, Sheetla Mata Temple Road, Sohna Road, Pataudi Road, Badshapur, Daulatabad and Rajendra Park.
 
 Sources said to run a banquet hall, one must have a trade licence and a no-objection certificate from the MCG and the fire department. However, most of the halls don’t have fire NOC and other necessary permissions.
