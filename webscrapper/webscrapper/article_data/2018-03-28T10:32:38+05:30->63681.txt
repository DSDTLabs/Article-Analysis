CHANDIGARH: The seventh DST   kicked off at   on Tuesday here. During its inauguration, founder director of   (INST), Mohali, Ashok Kumar Ganguli spoke on the topic 'Gifts of science to society: Let us think about it'. 

 "There is science all around us - ranging from colours of butterflies, the ability of lizards to climb walls, smell of food, changing colours of the sky to switching on a water pump, getting an X-ray in a hospital. We can hardly think what our lives would be in the absence of such developments," said Ganguli. 
 
 "It is important for students to realise the science in everyday's life, which we take for granted. This has only been possible on the back of ingenuity, hard work and passion of scientists," he added. 
 
 Ganguli also talked about some of the most amazing technologies of today like Maglev trains, artificial skin and other technologies that come under the ambit of nanotechnology.
 
 Meanwhile, programme coordinator of   camp Anurag Kuhad said a total 532 meritorious students, including 230 girls and 300 boys from the government school in the rural areas of Haryana, participated in the DST Inspire camp. 
 
 At the camp, Panjab University vice-chancellor   highlighted the importance of learning and motivated the children to not give up at any point of their life.
 
 In another session, Professor Govindan Rangarajan of department of mathematics and chairman of division of interdisciplinary research at   (IISc), Bangalore gave an overview of the new field of Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI). 
 
 "The goal of BMIs is to read the mind of a person albeit in a limited sense. For example, by recording signals from the brain, one attempts to infer what kind of motor action a person wishes to perform. This research is interdisciplinary in nature and involves neuroscience, mathematics, computer science, robotics and signal processing. This research can be applied to help paralysed patients," he added.
