JAIPUR: The family of 45-year-old property dealer  , who was shot dead in   on Thursday evening, has lodged a FIR against one Shankar Khandelwal in the murder case.

 Khandelwal is one of the accused arrested by the CBI in the multi-crore Syndicate Bank fraud and was out on bail. Singh was shot dead outside his house at Brij Mandal Colony in Jhotwara locality late Thursday evening.
 
 However, the police have not ruled out the possibility of a contract killer who may have been hired by those who wanted to eliminate the property dealer.
 
 Other than property, Singh also ran a personal loan business. The investigation also suggested that Singh was into taking loans at lower interest rates and lending the same on higher rates.
 
 Senior police officers are probing various angles after the family of the deceased lodged named Khandelwal in the FIR. Police have neither ruled out Khandelwal’s involvement in the murder nor have given him a clean chit.
 
 According to sources, Khandelwal has also been quizzed by the police. “He has claimed that all disputes he had with the deceased have been sorted out. We are verifying various facts as the deceased was into taking loans on interest, for say 2%, and later lending it for 3 to 4%. It’s a bit complex,” said a senior police officer.
 
 On Friday, the police rounded up almost six persons who were close to Singh with relation to his finance business.
 
 “There are no major leads in this case so far. One thing that’s almost confirmed is that the murder was committed due to some money-related dispute,” said additional commissioner of police (ACP-crime)   while speaking to TOI.
 
 It may be recalled that last year in September, Khandelwal had overdosed on medicines meant for treating cancer and attempted suicide. A case of attempted suicide was also lodged against him at   police station. He had maintained that some people were blackmailing him and alleged that they were after his life.
