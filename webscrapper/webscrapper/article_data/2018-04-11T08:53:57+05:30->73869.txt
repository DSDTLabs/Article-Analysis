JAIPUR: Former international archer  , who is suffering from a neuro-degenerative condition, will only get worse with time, doctors treating him told TOI on Tuesday.

 
 
 
 Limba, who is also a former India coach, had been diagnosed with this condition around a month back, but was admitted at the government-run Sawai Mansingh Hospital only on Saturday.
 
 
 
 A coach at  's   academy, his colleagues suspected something was wrong when his walking and speech started getting affected. Since then, he has been under treatment. “To be honest, there is no treatment for this condition,” one of the doctors treating him said. “There is no time frame either on how fast his condition will deteriorate. We know that it can't improve and will progressively get worse. At this moment we are only assuring him that things will be fine.”
 
 The entire expense for Limba's treatment is being borne by the Sports Council. The exact nature of the degenerative disease will be known only after a few genetic tests are done. The SMS Hospital will have to send some of his samples to private laboratories for these tests, which might prove quite expensive. The sports council has paid him two months wages in advance. “As of now, he has vertigo and some slurring of speech,” the doctor said. “His memory is perfectly fine.”
 
 Limba represented India in three Olympic Games and in 1992, he equalled the world record in the 30m event in the Asian Archery Championships in Beijing. He won the Arjuna Award in 1991 and was conferred the Padma Shri in 2012. Limba, incidentally, was offered an AC room at the hospital, but he refused. “He said he will stay in the non-AC room,” the doctor said. In fact, Limba had been reluctant to meet doctors in the first place, but was persuaded by his colleagues.
