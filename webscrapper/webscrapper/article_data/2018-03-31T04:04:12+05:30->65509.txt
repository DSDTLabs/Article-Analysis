Mumbai: Thousands of Muslim women will protest at   on Saturday to demand "call back" of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill against   passed by the   in December 2017. 

 Called by the   (AIMPLB), it is perhaps the first exclusive women's protest in support of Sharia laws in the city. "Our demand is clear. Take back the triple talaq Bill, which is against women, anti-gender justice and aimed at pushing Muslim husbands to jail," said AIMPLB spokesperson (women's wing) Asma Zahra on Friday. She added that five crore signatures from across the country supporting the board's stand have been sent to the Law Commission. "Our protest is also to respond to the few women who distributed sweets after the government passed the Bill in haste in the Lok Sabha. The Bill is an attempt to interfere with person al laws and we will not accept it," she said.
 
 Muslim politicians of different parties have supported the protest. "The triple talaq Bill not only criminalises talaq, but is a step towards the Uniform Civil Code which the RSS wants to impose. The Constitution grants citizens freedom to practice their religions but this government wants to rob citizens of this freedom. This is very rare that so many women from different sects in the community are assembling to protest this Bill," said former minister and Congress MLA Arif Naseem Khan. He has placed ads in Urdu dailies, appealing to Muslim women to attend Saturday's protest.
 
 AIMPLB executive member Monisa Bushra Abidi said the protest would be peaceful and no slogans will be raised. "Male members and volunteers are only backing us. Only female speakers will address the gathering and our demands will be raised also through placards and banners," said Bushra. She added that instead of bringing a law which criminalises triple talaq, the government could have asked the community to bring reforms from within.
