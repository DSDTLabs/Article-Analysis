AHMEDABAD:   exonerated a woman and her lover of charges of the murder of her husband at a village near Una in Gir-Somnath district after medical evidence was found to contradict what was revealed in the police investigation.

 The woman, Deviben Ahir, and her paramour  , were sentenced to life imprisonment by a trial court in Una on February 28, 2012. They were convicted for murder, destruction of evidence and hatching criminal conspiracy. 
 
 They were accused of giving sleeping pills to Deviben’s husband Babu Devsinh Bheda, dragging him to the field, giving him an electric shock and throwing his body into a well.
 
 The incident had taken place on June 13, 2009. The FIR was lodged by Bheda’s mother, who said Deviben had a relationship with Vadher and she had confessed to the crime before the village sarpanch.
 
 Both the accused persons challenged the trial court’s verdict before the HC, which heard the case at length. It perused the FSL report, which revealed that no poison was found in the viscera during the postmortem. The report also suggested that Bheda may have died of suffocation after his face and nose were covered with force. This evidence was in stark contrast to the prosecution’s theory.
 
 The HC quashed the trial court’s conviction and acquitted both the accused. It said that the motive for the murder was not established. The cause of death projected by prosecution was at variance with medical evidence. 
 
 The recovery of sedatives does not necessarily mean that the husband was poisoned. Even call detail records showing repeated phone calls between the accused does not establish their connection with the murder in the absence of any reliable evidence.
