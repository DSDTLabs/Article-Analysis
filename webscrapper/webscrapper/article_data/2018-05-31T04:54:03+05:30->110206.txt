NEW DELHI: Seeking acrossthe-aisle engagement of political parties, Vice President   said they should treat each other as rivals and not enemies, saying “sitting next to each other does not convert you”. “Political parties are rivals but not enemies. They may have different ideas and ideologies, but all are trying to do the best for the country. So, we should treat them as rivals and not as enemies,” Naidu said at a function where he released the book “Straight Talk” by   MP Abhishek Manu Singhvi. 

 
 His comments were seen in the light of the controversy generated by former President Pranab Mukherjee’s decision to attend a function at the RSS headquarters on June 7. The moderator at Singhvi’s book release referred to the presence of leaders of different parties as “across the aisle” dialogue, like Mukherjee’s upcoming visit to the RSS heasquarters. 
 
 The gathering included former PM  , former Union minister P Chidambaram, Congress chief whip in Lok Sabha Jyotiraditya Scindia, DMK’s Kanimozhi and Trinamool Congress’ Dinesh Trivedi. Expressing concern over continued disruptions hampering proceedings in the  , Naidu, who is the chairman of the  , said a committee reviewing the rules of the house business would submit its report next month. 
 
 Referring to suggestions from Singhvi in his book that members disrupting proceedings should be automatically suspended, Naidu expressed hope that the committee would consider the senior lawyer’s view. He said, “I have set up a committee to review and revisit the Rules of Procedure and Business of the Rajya Sabha for enabling smooth functioning of the House. 
 
 This committee has started work and an interim report is likely to be submitted next month.” The committee was formed in the wake of the Upper House failing to transact much business during the budget session.
