BENGALURU: Congress MLA NA Haris' son Mohammed Nalapad Haris surrendered before police on Monday morning, 37 hours after he and his friends allegedly brutally attacked a management graduate in a posh restaurant in the city. To the surprise of the cops,   turned up at the   police station in an autorickshaw. 

 Six of his associates were nabbed on Sunday.
 
  All seven accused were produced before the VIII ACMM court on Nrupatunga Road. The judge remanded them to two days in police custody. Clad in a white shirt, jeans and cap, a relaxed Md Haris waved to supporters outside the court as he got into a police van. "Don't worry, nothing will happen to us. We shall come out clean," he said. 
 
  The surrender of the lawmaker's son came soon after police included the   section 307 (attempt to murder) against him and his associates. Sources said police had secured the court approval to scale up the charges in the incident. 
 
 The police jeep escorting the van had a tough time making its way through the milling crowd. The accused are to be produced in court again on February 21.
 
  There was drama as Md Haris, who was on the run since Saturday  , turned up at the police station around 11am. Cops were tipped off that the Shantinagar MLA's son might surrender during the day, but it was not clear if he would do so before the  , which has taken over the case, or Cubbon Park police, which has registered the case.
