CHENNAI: Close to five years after an underground   leaked and contaminated   in  , another fissure in the line on Friday, just 100m from the site of the last discharge, threatened to wreak similar havoc before Indian   personnel promptly plugged it.

 Residents of Kummalamman Koil Street, Tondiarpet, reported the leak around 6am. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) officials and technicians quickly joined policemen at the spot and blocked the leak. IOC officials said it was a minor leak.
 
 Kummalamman Koil Street resident A V   said he noticed oil seeping on the road around 5am.
 
 “I realised that it was oil when a motorist slipped on the stretch,” he said. “IOC officials arrived by 7am, plugged the leak and covered the slippery surface. That helped ease a traffic hold-up on the road.”
 
 Oil leaked from the pipeline and polluted groundwater in September 2012. At the time, IOC personnel had to remove oil from the street by the barrel.
 
 “The oil pipelines in this network are 30 years old,” an IOC official said. “We have been checking them regularly to see them for repairs.”
 
 IOC has for the past six months been in the process of laying a new pipeline to replace the existing one.
