HYDERABAD: A group of candidates, aspiring to appear for the   (TET) and   met officials of school education department on Tuesday and asked them to reschedule the   so that they could appear for both the tests. 

 G Ravi, one of the candidates, who was part of this group said,"We have met the official concerned from the school education department and requested her to reschedule the exam. She has asked us to come with marks memos and other required documents."
 
 While the candidates claimed that this is a genuine problem and would deprive them of a chance to secure a government job, officials, on the other hand, maintained that no 'real' candidate had approached them appealing for a change in exam schedule.
 
 "While a group of students came to meet me, none of them are appearing for both exams. So, as of now, it is only hypothetical that few candidates have registered for both the exams. If a genuine candidate comes with this problem then we will look into the issue," said B Seshu Kumari, an official from school education department, which conducts the TET exam.
 
  (TSPSC) officials, meanwhile, said that the nature of both the exams are different, as one is a competitive recruitment test conducted by  , and the other is an eligibility test for BEd candidates conducted by the education department. Both are slated for July 23.
