NEW DELHI: Amid travellers complaining of  , West Bengal and   running late, the   said ongoing work to clear the huge maintenance backlog and execution of new infrastructure projects were delaying trains and the situation on the main routes was expected to improve in 3-4 months.

 
 A top railway official said maintenance of its vast network would remain the top priority as the state-run transporter has decided not to operate trains in "unsafe" conditions. He added that the condition would improve on high density routes within 3-4 months as some key works would be over by then.
 
 "We will not tolerate unsafe conditions. Officers at the ground level are being reminded again and again. Maintenance is our top priority," the official said. "Punctuality is affected also because infrastructure creation is happening at the same time. Several projects for doubling, tripling and new lines are being taken up," he added.
 
 Another official said the transporter had almost doubled the spending on infrastructure projects in the last four years and completion of these works were causing delays. He added that the number of trains running on the network rose exponentially while infrastructure was not created with the same pace to accommodate the growing traffic.
 
 While 1,000 trains ran on the railway network in 2000, the number has now gone up to 2,600, outstripping the network capacity.
 
 According to official figures, almost 30 per cent of trains ran late in the 2017-18 financial year. From April 2017-March 2018, the punctuality of mail and express trains was 71.39 per cent, down from 76.69 per cent in the corresponding period of 2016-2017. In 2015-2016, 77.44 per cent trains ran on time.
 
 Admitting that passengers were facing problems due to delays, officials said in 2017-18, 30 per cent more blocks (time slots where trains don't run in a section) were given to take up maintenance and new works.
