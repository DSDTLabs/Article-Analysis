NAGPUR: For the seventh consecutive year, the   ( ) has increased water tariff by 5%. In all, the tariff has been hiked by 41% in last seven years. It is being done every fiscal to hike rate paid to the private operator   (OCW) Private Limited.

 Municipal commissioner Shravan Hardikar has approved the hike on March 30 and it came into effect from April 1. The water bill for all four quarters of 2017-18 will be calculated as per revised tariff.
 
 The residential consumers will have to pay Rs7.04 per unit for consumption up to 20 units. Any consumption over 20 units will attract high tariff. Water rate for consumption between 21 to 30 units is Rs11.26 per unit followed by Rs15.49 per unit for 31 to 80 units and Rs21.12 per unit for 80 and above units.
 
 The water tariff of remaining six categories-- slum, institutional-A, B, commercial-A, B and 2 have been hiked by 5%.
 
 Confirming about the revision in water tariff, executive engineer (water works) Sanjay Gaikwad told TOI that the water tariff has been hiked as per powers given by the general body to the civic chief. “Hike in water tariff every fiscal is part of water bylaws. General body made few amendments in the water bylaws couple of months ago but did not revise the decision to hike the water tariff by 5% every year,” he said.
 
 The NMC had roped in OCW for operation and maintenance of water works along with execution of works and implementation of 24x7 water supply project in 2010-11. The NMC had agreed to pay Rs7.90 per unit to OCW whereas minimum water tariff was Rs5 per unit in 2010-11. The NMC had also accepted in the agreement to increase the OCW rate as per revision made in consumer price index and wholesale price index every year. The RBI increases the two indexes every year. Therefore, the NMC has to increase OCW rate every fiscal. To cope with the revision, the civic body is increasing the water tariff every fiscal. The NMC has, thus, increased water tariff by 41% since 2010-11.
 
 The NMC and OCW agreement is for 25 years. If the spree of hike continues, the residential consumers will have to pay up to Rs17-51 per unit for water in 25 years.
 
 OCW denied water tariff being hiked every fiscal to increase its rate. “OCW is executing 24x7 water supply project along with operation and maintenance of existing water supply system and its improvement. Powers for revision in tariff, new connection and disconnection are with the NMC,” the company said.
