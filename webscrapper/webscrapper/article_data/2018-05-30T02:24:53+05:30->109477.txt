Ever since   and   have been spotted at several occasions together, speculations around them dating each other have been constantly doing the rounds. The two newbies of B-town will be seen opposite each other in ‘Dhadak’, which is being produced by Dharma Productions and directed by Shashank Khaitan.

 
 Recently, a picture of the Janhvi, Ishaan and Shashank had started doing the rounds on the internet, proving that the trio shares an amazing rapport with each other. In fact, Janhvi and Ishaan do share a close bond with each other and their Instagram updates are a proof of that. 
 
 
 Just a few days ago, Janhvi had hacked into Ishaan’s Instagram account and had spammed with one word random comments on pictures. She started writing, “Omg”, “Are you excited-jk”, “Guys”, one after the other and these random comments did not even make sense. Soon, when fans were wondering about these unexplained comments, Ishaan posted a clarification and wrote, “Please beware… this comment feed has most kindly been raided by the nut is my co-actor @Janhvikapoor.”
 
 
 In other instances, Janhvi was seen goofing around with various emojis on his pictures which have an inside joke attached to them as well. In one such comment, she wrote, “who wants a pappi”. To which a user replied, “Me”. But, obviously Janhvi wrote back and said, “No”.
 
 
 Well, these two are complete goofballs and we love their off-screen camaraderie. ‘Dhadak’ is a remake of the Marathi blockbuster film ‘Sairat’ which is slated to release on July 20th.
