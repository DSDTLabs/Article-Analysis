  “There are 642 agriculture-land holding farmers’ families in the village. Of these, 400 are marginal holdings and the rest small landholders with less than 5 acres of land. These farmers, who have also taken up dairy activities, largely depend on the grazing land for green and dry fodder,” he said.
 
 Patil said that there are about 1,700 cattle in the village which also houses two units of the Karnataka Milk Federation and two private milk procurement centres.

The government itself is struggling to provide green fodder to cattle owing to drought. The move to transfer 51 acres of grazing land has come as a shock to the villagers who have decided to protest the decision,” he said.
