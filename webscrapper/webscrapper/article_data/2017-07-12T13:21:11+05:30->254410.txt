BHOPAL: Tomato prices have skyrocketed in Bhopal up to Rs 100 per kg on Tuesday from a price range of Rs 20-30 per kg about a month ago due to short supply of of the vegetable. 

 The current price rise is because the tomato growers in the state had stopped its production following excess production and subsequent price crash, said local vegetable dealers. 
 
 "On Tuesday, one crate of tomato weighing about 22-25 kg was auctioned at Rs 1,700. After it went out to the mandi with 2% mandi tax, the cost of the vegetable was already about Rs 80 a kg," said Abdool Raqib, president of vegetable wholesalers body here. In the retail market, the cost of tomato price ranges from Rs 90 to 100 a kg depending upon its quality.
