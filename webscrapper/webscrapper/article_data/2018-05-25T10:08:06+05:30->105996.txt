PALAKKAD: The forest department on Thursday filed chargesheet in   first class judicial magistrate court against 12 persons for trespassing into the forest under the Kerala Forest Act and the lynching of tribal youth  . 

 
  They are among the 16 persons charged with murder by the police and now lodged in   sub-jail waiting for trial in the incident that took place on February 22.
 
  Mannarkkad divisional forest officer ( ) V P   said the chargesheet was filed under Section 27 of the Kerala Forest (KF) Act for encroaching into the forest and dragging Madhu out of the forest, resulting in his lynching by a mob.
 
  Under the KF Act the accused could get three years' imprisonment and fine in this case, the DFO said.
 
 He said the chargesheet has three independent witnesses, besides the testimony of two persons who were engaged in forest-related works in the area when the incident took place.
 
  One of the witnesses is a woman cook who was making food for the workers engaged in some work for the forest department. She said in her statement that she saw some people taking Madhu by force from the Pottikkal cave inside the forest where he was living.
 
  She gave him water and tried to give food as he was looking hungry and tired. But the people who took him by force out of the forest did not allow him to take the food.
 
  The DFO said a vigilance inquiry was conducted on the involvement of some forest department officials in identifying Madhu and locating him inside the forest. But there was no evidence of the presence of forest department officials at the location when the incident took place.
