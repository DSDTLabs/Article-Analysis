AGARTALA: A day before the assembly election, ruling   on Saturday complained to the chief election commissioner about it described as a 'secret' meeting between two top poll panel officials and state   president Biplab Kumar Deb here. 

 In its complaint, CPM alleged that Deb met EC's special observer RK Pachnanda, who is DG (ITBP), and state chief electoral officer (CEO) Sriram Taranikanta. 
 
 In a quick reaction, the CEO described the meeting as "coincidental". He said, "Deb arrived when the special observer was in my chamber to complain about security arrangements." He added, "Later, when CPM state secretary Bijan Dhar came to me to inquire about the meeting, I told him he too can meet the special observer. There was nothing secret (about Deb's meeting)."
