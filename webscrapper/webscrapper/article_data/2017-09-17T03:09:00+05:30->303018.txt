Panaji: Chief minister, Manohar Parrikar on Saturday said the registration of a first information report (FIR) against the leader of Opposition, Chandrakant ‘Babu’ Kavlekar in over Rs 4.78 crore disproportionate assets case is not politically motivated. Speaking to mediapersons, he said that it is a standard procedure to register an FIR if the probe agencies find assets disproportionate to known sources of income. “Why should it be a politically-motivated case? FIR is based on facts. If someone refutes the facts, then he is free to give evidence and endorse it,” he said, adding, “Once probe agencies have done their duty, there is no reason as to why a person be excluded from its ambit, irrespective of his position. When asked to comment on Congress reaction that it was a politically-motivated move, Parrikar said that Congress cannot deny factual position. “Whether it is a case of disproportionate assets or not, I think ACB has made its stand clear in a press briefing about the value of assets,” he added. Chief minister said that it took time for the probe agency to register the FIR as it had to collect documents and translate it. When asked whether Kavlekar should resign as an MLA, Parrikar said I don’t feel that he should do so until court finds him guilty. “Whether he should resign or not, Congress should take a call. I do not dictate term for his side,” Parrikar said, adding, the FIR is meant basically for the purpose of investigation.
