GHAZIABAD: An 11-year-old girl was found dead under mysterious circumstances in JJ cluster in Indirapuram’s Gyan Khand 3 on Wednesday afternoon. Her father spotted her body   from a bamboo shaft inside the house. 

 The girl’s father works as a security guard. “There was no one in the house as my wife and sons were out for work and when I returned in the afternoon, I found the door locked from inside. When no one opened the door, I forced my way into the house and found her body hanging by a dupatta from the bamboo shaft,” her father said. He then informed the police, who reached the spot shortly.
 
 Sub-inspector Anup Singh, who conducted initial investigations, suggested that the girl may have hanged herself. “Given the mark on her neck and the circumstances it seems the girl may have hanged herself, which is surprising given the age of the girl,” said Anup Singh. “We will be in a position to say anything conclusively only after seeing postmortem report,” added Singh. He also ruled out any sexual assault in the case. “There was no sign of sexual assault but we are questioning the neighbours”, said Singh. So far, no case has been registered and the body has been sent for postmortem.
