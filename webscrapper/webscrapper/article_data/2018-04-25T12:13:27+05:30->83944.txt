One of the major IT exporters, Wipro is all set to announce its fourth   today i.e. April 25, 2018. All analysts and market enthusiasts are firm on the management commentary on its energy segment that constitutes about 13 per cent of the software giant's revenues. Moreover, an update on healthcare vertical will be closely looked upon. 

 For January-March, Wipro had guided for 1-3 per cent qoq (quarter on quarter) constant currency revenue growth. The guidance factored in meaningful revenue impact from insolvency of a customer wherein it also took 50 million one-time provision on costs in the previous quarter, noted Motilal Oswal, a popular brokerage firm. 
 
  stated that Wipro will not be able to make up in terms of lag peers in the FY19-20 growth. It further added, the management guidance of reaching industry level growth rate seems difficult. 
 
 As far as Q4 results are concerned,   expects the brokerage to report growth of 2.1 per cent and 1.1 per cent, the lower-end of guidance, in dollar and constant currency terms, respectively. Edelweiss said, this would be on account of client-specific issues in utilities and telecom verticals. 
 
 Wipro has managed some decent acquisitions like Appirio (cloud) and Design IT (design services) to push its digital offerings, but deal wins remain patchy, HDFC Securities Institutional Research said, adding that the EBIT margin has been the lowest but recovery will be slow. 
 
 Meanwhile,   believes that outlook on parity with industry growth on sequential and yearly basis, continuation of strength in BFSI where outlook is positive and trends in retail, manufacturing, telecom and healthcare and energy will be watched due to the prevailing cautious outlook.
