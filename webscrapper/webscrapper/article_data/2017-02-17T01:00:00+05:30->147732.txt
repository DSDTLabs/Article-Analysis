The album, released by Junglee Music, opens with 'Mahi', a song that talks about coping with the loss of a loved one. It’s Harshdeep Kaur all the way, with Shabad Sabri giving her able support. Harshdeep blows life into Sameer Anjaan’s lyrics with her soothing rendition and the use of folk string instruments keep the rhythm going. The Sufi-inspired number tugs at your heart strings right from the word go and is definitely the pick of the album. The title track 'Irada' is right up Neeraj’s alley. It is a soft rock number, with electronic guitar playing an important role in lifting it. Nikhil Uzgare delivers his punch well; the song is motivational and showcases the strength of determination, but doesn’t have repeat value. Another slow melody, 'Chaand Rajai Odhe' is a beautiful lullaby. Papon seems to have enjoyed singing the number and it shows in the way he maintains the cadence. This haunting track grows on you, albeit at its own pace. The last number in the album, 'Mitran De', starts with bhangra beats but somehow seems like a misfit. On its own, the song is passable, with the energetic Master Saleem, Kaur B and Earl Edgar giving it their best. The songs of 'Irada' are not hard on your ears and manage to linger for longer in your memory.
