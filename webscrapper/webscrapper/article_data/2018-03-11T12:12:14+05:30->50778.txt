VIJAYAWADA: With the mercury recording a steady rise in the city over the past few days, there has a spike in the sale of seasonal   and local beverages. Many people are consuming fruits and drinks to beat the heat and at the same time, the cost of seasonal fruits like watermelons has doubled in the last 10 days due to an increase in demand. 

 The mercury has touched 39.0 degrees Celsius recently and most of the roads wore a deserted look during the afternoons. However, the rare few who are forced to get out into the streets are consuming cut watermelons, sugarcane juice and coconut water for hydration. Street vendors are selling the fruits at a steep rate. For instance, the cost of fine quality watermelons is Rs 160 in local markets, while it was only Rs 90 earlier. 
 
 “Fruit vendors are taking advantage of the huge demands for watermelons and coconuts as the prices of these fruits have doubled recently. But we have to buy them because of the weather,” said K. Venkateswarulu, a revenue employee. 
 
 Besides, many are going for carbonated drinks like lemon soda and  , which are cheap but harmful. “Cool drinks and aerated beverages with artificial flavours will leave bad impact on gut health during summer,” said Dr  , a general physician. He advised the consumption of buttermilk, coconut water and season fruits are good for health.
