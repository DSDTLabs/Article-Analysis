LUCKNOW: Out of every five electricity consumers in  , the home district of Samajwadi Party patriarch  , only one pays the bill. The situation is almost similar in Kannauj, the parliamentary constituency of SP president Akhilesh Yadav’s wife Dimple.

 The parliamentary constituency and home district of UP chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath,   too reports very high rate of power theft.
 
 In fact, in Kauriram division of Gorakhpur, power pilferage is to the tune of over 80%. These startling findings are from an internal assessment report on aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses prepared by the   (UPPCL).
 
 The report has data till December 2016, a month before the notification for the UP assembly election came into effect. The report, that poses a challenge at a time when the UP government is gearing up to implement the Centre’s flagship ‘24x7 power for all’ scheme, categorically highlights that of the total power supplied, almost 31% got pilfered in the 13 months between December 2015 and December 2016. This was over double the 15% mandated by the  . The report shows that almost 16,000 million units of power, accounting for over Rs 6,500 crore, were lost in pilferage and transmission losses.
 
 According to the report , the highest power theft rate of around 44% was recorded in the Dakshinanchal Distribution Company which supplied power to districts like Agra and Mathura. This meant almost every second consumer did not pay for electricity consumed.
 
 Industry experts said 24x7 electricity for all will not materialise until power theft is not checked. Sources said UPPCL was planning to carry out an exhaustive anti-theft drive in several districts.
