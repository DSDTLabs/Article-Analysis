NEW DELHI:   on Wednesday took on   and former finance minister   over the 80:20 gold import scheme, asking why certain trading houses, including now-tainted Mehul Choksi’s Gitanjali Gems, were allowed to import gold just a day before the 2014 Lok Sabha results were announced.

 Countering Congress leader Anand Sharma, who claimed the allegations against Chidambaram were not backed by facts, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad shared the purported office memorandum allowing trading housing to import gold.
 
 Prasad said BJP made charges after doing its homework. “... was it a price, was it a consideration, was it pressure or was it an obligation. Why did Mr Chidambaram, a well-informed politician, take this decision one day before results?” he said.
 
 Prasad claimed the nature of pressure or price could be assessed from the fact that in a single day, the file travelled with “supersonic speed through nine desks after his signature,” followed by the memorandum.
 
 Raising questions, the BJP minister said, Chidambaram knew the Constitution and “any person having the slightest consideration of democratic integrity, propriety and sanity of democratic polity would never do this”.
 
 The minister showed an RBI notification dated May 21, 2014, claiming that the central bank administration notified the order to allow trading houses to import gold before the new government assumed office.
 
  introduced the 80:20 rule in August 2013 allowing traders to import gold only after they exported 20% of gold from their previous import.   scrapped the rule in 2014.
