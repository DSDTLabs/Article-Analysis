COLVA: First Additional Civil Judge N S Amonkar on Thursday rejected the discharge application of Francis   alias ‘Boy’ and directed him to stand trial in the alleged desecration case of Holy Cross namely ‘Tariyalo Khuris’ at Cotta Chandor.

 Maina-Curtorim police had charged the accused with the desecration of ‘Tariyalo Khuris’ on the intervening night of June 6-7, 2017.
 
 Judge Amonkar refused to accept the contention of the defence advocate that there is no evidence against him. While rejecting the discharge application, the judge said that only a trial will bring out the truth in the matter. 
 
 The judge then read out the charges against   who pleaded not guilty, and then directed to issue summons to three witnesses in the case and adjourned the matter for January 30. 
 
 The counsel appearing for the accused informed TOI that she would file a revision appeal.. This is the first of the twelve cases that he has been directed to face trial. Also, Pereira was discharged in another desecration case of ‘Alma Khuris’ at Cavorim, Chandor in June last year.
