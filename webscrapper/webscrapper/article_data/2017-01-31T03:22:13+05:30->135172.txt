New Delhi: In a setback to the Aam Aadmi Party and its national convener  , a Delhi court on Monday dismissed a plea filed by him and five AAP members seeking a chance to be heard in a   filed by Union finance minister  .

 The court dismissed the plea as it is likely to frame notice against Kejriwal, Kumar Vishwas, Ashutosh, Sanjay Singh, Raghav Chadha and Deepak Bajpai on the next date of hearing, March 25. 
 
 Jaitley had filed a defamation case against the six accused alleging that they had made “false and defamatory” statements in a case involving the  , thereby harming his reputation.
 
 “Law is one and same for all the parties. Consistent and certain application of law is the very strength of law. Law cannot afford to be inconsistent, neither can it be applied inconsistently,” said chief metropolitan magistrate Sumit Dass. “I am of the considered opinion that no ground is made out for hearing the accused persons at the stage of framing of notice. The application is bereft of any merit, malafide and filed solely with a view to stall the trial,” he added.
 
 Senior counsel Ram Jethmalani, who appeared for the chief minister, argued that all the leaders belonged to one political party and they had the right to voice opinion, even if their views were similar. 
 
 Contesting the arguments on behalf of Jaitley, senior counsel Sidharth Luthra and advocates Manoj Taneja and Manik Dogra sought the plea’s dismissal asserting that the sole intention of filing such a plea was to delay the criminal proceedings. The court asked the AAP leaders to be present on March 25.
