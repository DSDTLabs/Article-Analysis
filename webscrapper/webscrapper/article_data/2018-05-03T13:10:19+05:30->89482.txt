Ilze also said she was in touch with IG (Thiruvananthapuram) Manoj Abraham, who has been supervising the investigation into the death of her sister and that she was satisfied with the way the investigation was progressing.
 
 Later in the day, she met chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to express her gratitude for the assistance provided by the government in the search for Liga till her body was found. Tourism minister Kadakampally Surendran was also present at the meeting.
 
 Ilze told the chief minister that she made the visit for tendering an apology for the smear campaign launched against the government in certain sections of the media, though the government had provided her all the support. In reply, Vijayan told her not to worry about such campaigns as they were politically motivated.
