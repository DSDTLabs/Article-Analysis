ZIRAKPUR: The residents of   are worried about the day when the double-lane railway tracks between   and Chandigarh will become operational. It will mean that the frequency of the trains will increase and so will the traffic jams at the Dhakoli crossing, where an underpass is still to be laid. 

 During a visit to the area on Saturday, TOI found out that the waiting period at the railway crossing was from 18 to 20 minutes when the train was about to pass. Even afterwards, there is a long traffic jam in the area. Residents complain that these days the railway crossing is shut for more than 6 minutes before the arrival of the train and the gate is opened a good 4 minutes after the train passes. It accumulates a lot of traffic on both sides. There are instances when the public has to wait for more than half an hour to at the crossing to let the train pass.
 
 Since the slow, goods trains will run on the double-lane tracks, commuters will have to wait longer at the Dhakoli railway crossing. It has become a routine affair to but now it's going to become torturous. They already have a lot of problems because there is no underpass at the point.   (URWA) president K R Sharma said: "An underpass was approved for this crossing but the work on it had not started till date."
 
 URWA vice-president   said: "We are going to give a representation to the local municipal council president and ask him raise the issue with the railway authorities. The residents are going to face a lot of problems when the double-lane tracks become operational. During the trial run these days, the goods trains cross Dhakoli at a very slow speed, which builds up a long traffic jam in the area."   housing society resident G S Verma said the authorities concerned should speed up the underpass project.
