Chief minister   on Sunday sidestepped any threat from the pre-poll arrangement between SP and BSP, by calling it an “unnatural relation”. 

 “Kahu Rahim kaise nibhe, ber ker ko sang. Arthath kela aur ber ek saath nahi khaaye jaate (A banana and Indian Jujube never go together),” Yogi said in Allahabad. 
 
 He was in   to campaign for   bypoll. Like 2014, BJP has fielded an   candidate, Kushalendra Singh Patel, in Phulpur.
