 Inspired by the  ,   (37) is also providing free rides to commuters between from midnight to 4am, provided they promise to join his initiative. He is probably the first autorickshaw driver in NCR to have taken such a step.
 
 Sharma, who got an NCR permit for his auto in December 2015, ferries commuters within Noida and Delhi.
 
 “Swachh Bharat, Swasth Bharat”, “Nari ka Samman, Desh ka Samman” and “Beti Bachao, Beti Padhaao” are some of the messages his auto flaunts.
 
 “I started plying an autorickshaw in the city around four-five years ago. I bought a new auto with an NCR permit in December 2015. Throughout the year I was ferrying passengers, I noticed that many drivers and passengers eat things like gutkha and groundnuts and throw the waste inside the auto, or on the road. I felt that it is wrong and should be changed. I wanted to give a message to fellow drivers and commuters that we need to change this attitude,” Sharma told TOI.
 
 Sharma also gives free rides to people who agree to “promise him” to keep the surroundings clean, respect women and do at least one act of   each day.
