Vadodara: When he got a phone call from a woman about three years ago, he didn’t know that he and his family would have to face trouble. Twenty-eight-year-old Bhavi Tapiyawala approached Karelibaug police and registered a complaint of extortion and criminal intimidation against six people, including a woman. Bhavi told police that three persons had been harassing him and his mother over last two-and-half months and demanding Rs5 lakh. The police have arrested five people in the case. 

 According to the complainant, he had got a phone call from a woman who identified herself as Seema alias Shehnaz Dudhwala about three years ago. Bhavi told her that she dialled wrong number and disconnected the call. Shehnaz, however, called him again after three days and told him that she wasn’t getting along with her husband. Bhavi said in his complaint that she made obscene demands from him and they exchanged few messages following which he blocked her number. She later messaged him from different numbers. Bhavi told the police that she also contacted his friend Manan Pandya and made similar demands from him.
 
 When Bhavi learnt about it, he asked Manan to stay away from her. “About three months ago, Shehnaz and Yogesh Waghmare, who she claimed to be her husband, came to my home along with some unidentified person. Yogesh told my mother that I had raped his wife and also taken Rs5 lakh from her. He demanded the money and also threatened me,” the complainant said in his FIR. The accused kept coming for a few days when Bhavi wasn’t at home. 
 
 On Wednesday, the accused came yet again following which Bhavi’s mother called the police.
