AHMEDABAD: The heavy rains in the state have led to a spike in  . The price of almost all vegetables has crossed the Rs 70/kg mark, with the majority now in three figures, in the retail market.   have increased considerably  , even at wholesale markets.

 Tomatoes cost Rs 130 per kg in retail and were selling for Rs 85 in the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) complex in Jamalpur. Prices may rise further if demand increases.
 
  Several vegetables are have touched the Rs 100 mark or are nearing it. Brinjals are now retailing for Rs 60 a kg. Ladies’ fingers, cluster beans and green beans are retailing at around the Rs 100 mark.
 
 Deepak Patel, APMC secretary, says, “The prices of vegetables are skyrocketing because of the heavy rains in the city. Whenever there is a long spell of rains in the state, vegetable prices increase. 
 
 Once water levels recede in the fields, the prices will stabilize again.”
 
 Patel further said that the state at present is banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and south India. About 25% of the crop has been washed away, and hence there is a shortage in the market. Demand is also increasing, and consequently, so are the prices, said Patel.
 
 Against a demand for about 500 10-tonne vehicles, the city is getting only 150 vehicles a day. This is not even one-third of the normal supply, and hence prices are increasing even at the APMC complex. Farmers in the state did not get good prices for their produce earlier this year, and as a result they were forced to throw their crops on the roads. Ghanshyam Devgadia a trader in Memnagar says that prices are likely to further increase in August and September.
