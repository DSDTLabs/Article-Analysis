MUMBAI: A 33-year-old man, Jayanand Kanpure, who was arrested for the kidnap and rape of a minor was rearrested by the cyber crime cell in another case where he is accused of creating a 19-year-old girl’s fake   and posting her morphed pictures. Both the cases took place in 2016.

 The cyber crime cell arrested Kanpure, a resident of Cheeta Camp in Trombay, and produced him before a local court, which remanded him in police custody. In the rape case, Kanpure was arrested along with two others and booked under the POSCO Act. In the   account case, he has been booked under section of IPC (impersonation, defamation, insult to modesty of women) and Information Technology Act.
 
 In 2016, when the 19-year-old girl started getting obscene calls on her mobile number, she asked one of the callers how he had got her number. The caller told her he had got her number from a Facebook account. She checked the account and realised it had her morphed pictures and mobile number. She then approached the police and lodged a complaint.
 
 “The cyber crime police with help from technical experts found that the pictures were uploaded from a mobile number belonging to Kanpure,” said an officer. When cops went to arrest him, they realized he had already been arrested in a gangrape case and was lodged in Arthur road jail. “We applied to the court for his custody and on Thursday, arrested him,” he added.
