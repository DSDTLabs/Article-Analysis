SURAT: Some members of Uttar Bharatiya Rail Sangarsh Samiti (UBRSS) were allegedly beaten up by supporters of Navsari MP C R Paatil at the event to flag off   here by Union minister of state for railways   on Friday evening. 

 The office-bearers of UBRSS had gone to the railway station to meet Sinha over their long-pending demands for trains to their native places in North India. While minister of railways   was attending the flagging off function at Vadodara railway station, Sinha was deputed to Surat for the live event in the presence of Prime Minister   at Varanasi. 
 
 UBRSS leaders, including Anoop Rajput, Yajuvendra Dubey, Shaan Khan, Ajay Baba and a few others, were prevented from entering the venue. After verbal exchanges, UBRSS leaders were literally manhandled and beaten up by the supporters of Navsari MP. A few journalists were also beaten up, sources said. 
 
 UBRSS convener Ajit Tiwari said, “We had gone to represent our demands to MoS (railways) Manoj Sinha. It is our right as citizens to meet the minister and express our concerns for the community. However, Navsari MP’s goons did not allow us to meet Sinha and attacked us. Our organization’s member Anoop Rajput has sustained serious injury.”
 
 The UBRSS leaders gheraoed the police station of Government Railway Police (GRP) for more than four hours demanding registration of an FIR against the anti-social elements who had attacked them. 
 
 “We will get our members medically examined first. We are determined to lodge a complaint at the GRP police station for the dastardly act on us,” Tiwari added.
