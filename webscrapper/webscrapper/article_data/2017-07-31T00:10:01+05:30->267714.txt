Indore:   and infection are the two major reasons behind maternal   in the country, the experts said on Sunday.

  “Doctors should treat anaemia during   and have easy access to blood products. The team should be kept prepared to deal with any kind of emergency situation,” said Dr Nikita Rawal of Ishaan Foundation.
 
  Dr Uma Rajesh from United Kingdom said, “The main reasons for weakened medical services in India are-guidelines not being followed properly as well as the new things are not implemented. The hospitals should organise drills similar to those performed in aircraft and fire safety cases to save mother”.
 
  Speaking about how to reduce pain during delivery Dr Chetan Rupali from   said, “It is proven that the presence of partner reduces pain during the delivery and provides mental support as well” 
 
 She said that India has comparatively high number of caesarean babies being delivered. Whereas, the rate of caesarean babies delivered overseas is only 25 percent.
 
  “The figure can be reduced if we have trained staff, advanced machines and baby monitoring system. In addition, it is necessary for the doctor to discuss and explain to the pregnant woman about labour process and pain relief methods,” said Dr Rawal.
 
  A panel discussion among the doctors from private and public hospital with in vitro fertilization (IVF) centres showcased different figures of C-section deliveries.
 
  Dr Nilesh Dalal from MY Hospital said C-section deliveries are common in referral and IVF cases and patients, who arrive late at hospital. It is also common in late marriage pregnancy.
