CHANDIGARH:   president   will be visiting Rohtak and staying there for three days from August 2 to 4 as the ruling party in Haryana will try to consolidate its position after being in power for over two and a half years. Earlier, Shah was to stay for a day in Chandigarh and Panchkula and then was to spend two days in Haryana.

 With Shah camping in Rohtak for three days, it is seen as an attempt to woo voters in the area, which was the epicentre of the 2016 Jat agitation for reservation and is considered a stronghold of former chief minister   Hooda of the Congress.
 
 Confirming about the changes in Shah’s programme, Haryana BJP chief   told TOI that their party president had already visited Chandigarh, so it was decided to have him spend all three days in Rohtak, where party’s state office is located. Barala further stated that Shah’s Rohtak visit would include meetings with state cabinet, party MLAs, office-bearers of the party and different morchas. Shah would also inaugurate a library building in the party office. He was also expected to take a separate session with rebel BJP MLAs, asking them to mend their ways and focus on the 2019 polls.
 
 Sources also confirmed TOI that the BJP national president would also discuss and take up the issue of Jat agitation for reservation during his camping in Rohtak and expected to make party’s strategy on it. Eyeing the 2019   polls, Shah is on a country-wide tour since April to strategize and find ways to strengthen the party at the grassroots level. Shah’s Rohtak stay is also seen as a strategy to strengthen BJP in the area, which had not supported the party even during the Modi-wave in the May 2014 parliamentary elections.
 
 Rohtak has also turned into the epicentre of the Jat agitations for quota, especially after the stir of February 2016. There is lot of heartburn against the ruling BJP because Rohtak had the highest number of youths booked for the February 2016 violence.
