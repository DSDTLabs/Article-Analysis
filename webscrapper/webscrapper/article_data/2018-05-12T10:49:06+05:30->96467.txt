LUDHIANA: Police, on Thursday, booked a juvenile for attempt to rape a 14-year-old schoolgirl.

 In his police complaint, the girl’s 73-year-old grandfather said, “I have two granddaughters who study in classes IX and VI. As their school is nearby, they walk back home and reach within five minutes.” 
 
 When his younger granddaughter came home alone on Thursday, he asked her about his sister. “She said her elder sister was feeling enervated due to the scorching conditions. So, she sat outside a gurdwara to take some rest after the school got over at 2pm. She asked her to go back home and said she would come after a while,” he added. 
 
 Worried, the elderly man cycled to the gurdwara to pick her up.
 
 “But my granddaughter was not at the shrine. I rushed to her school. The guard there told me that all students had left. I was looking for her in the village when I heard her cries outside a vacant plot near the gurdwara. A juvenile was trying to force himself upon her. I caught hold of him, but he managed to make good his escape,” he said. 
 
 Investigating officer   said the accused was a 17-year-old school drop-out. “He runs a fast-food vend near the school where the girls study. When the girl was sitting outside the gurdwara, the juvenile forcibly took her to a nearby plot and tried to rape her,” the cop added. 
 
 A case has been registered.
