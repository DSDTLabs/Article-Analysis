JALANDHAR: After facing fire from   who held them responsible for the debacle in the  , the   has preferred to maintain a studied silence. This is in contrast to the pre-election days when none would dare to speak against the central leaders and those who did were expelled from the party on the charges of indiscipline.

 AAP leaders   and  , who were under fire from Punjab leaders at the meeting in Jalandhar on Monday, neither took phone calls nor responded to SMSs of queries about the recent development.
 
 Prominent party leaders of Punjab revealed that though they had passed a resolution seeking 'autonomy' and restructuring of the state unit, even they did not receive any calls from the Delhi leaders. They said the AAP volunteers at ground level had supported their con tentions.
 
 “As the details of the meeting and resolution became public, the volunteers shared the feeling that non-projection of a chief ministerial face, very tight control of Delhi leaders and their method of campaigning led to defeat of the party. Its performance was even below 2014 parliamentary polls when there was no formal structure in place,“ said an AAP candidate, who was part of the meeting on Monday.
 
 Meanwhile, some in party circles feel that there could be further split in the party in Punjab. Several original foot soldiers have parted ways or gone silent in last couple of years.
 
 During the meeting there was also a common refrain that  's sacking from the post of state convenor on the basis of a flimsy sting, which was never made public by the party, was also one of the reasons, which led to party graph going down in public perception.Such things made the party lose so badly in the Majha region, it was said.
