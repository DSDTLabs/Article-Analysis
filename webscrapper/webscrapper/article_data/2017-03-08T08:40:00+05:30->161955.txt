NEW DELHI: Police are yet to trace the speeding Mercedes that mowed down a 17-year-old boy in outer Delhi’s Mianwali Nagar on Sunday night. They have approached the car maker with the pieces of the grille and logo found at the accident spot to trace the owner. Sources said that each luxury vehicle has a unique batch number that can be retrieved with the help of the logo by the car maker.

 CCTV footage recovered from the area shows the car zigzagging on the road, but doesn’t capture the registration number. Police have contacted the Mercedes service centres to inform them about vehicles coming in for repairs. Cops suspect that the driver was injured after ramming a truck. As he would have visited a hospital for treatment, all medical institutions across Delhi-NCR have been alerted about patients arriving with accident injuries.
 
 During investigation, cops found that a group of workers from an electric supply company were resting near a tea stall when the accident took place. They had tried to chase the errant driver after he knocked down the teenager, Atul Arora. They are being questioned to find out whether any of them had managed to note down the vehicle number.
 
 The workers told the police that the Mercedes driver seemed drunk and could also be a teenager, which the police are yet to verify. They said there was another person seated beside the driver.
 
 The police have formed eight teams, one of which is liaisoning with the transport department to scan through all silver-coloured Mercedes vehicles registered with them. They have zeroed down on 10 vehicles in west and outer Delhi and their owners have been called in for questioning. Meanwhile, neighbours, family members and Arora’s friends have formed a social media group asking people to inform them if they spot a damaged Mercedes car.
