Bhopal: Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has made it mandatory to quote Aadhaar number for board exam registration of Class 9 and 11.

 The board in a circular released on September 26 has given detailed rules for Class 9 and Class 11 registrations of CBSE affiliated schools.
 
 ‘All CBSE affiliated schools should register themselves before proceeding for online submission. They can use the password and ‘Affiliation Number’ as user ID already available with them. Newly affiliated schools should contact the concerned regional office of the CBSE for obtaining password,’ reads the circular.
 
 Secretary Sahodaya group of schools Bhopal Sojan Joseph said the students who don’t have Adhaar cards must apply for it as soon as possible. “Without Adhaar number, we can’t register students since it has been made mandatory,” he said.
 
 For the first time, the CBSE has made it compulsory for candidates to submit their Aadhaar number for registration for the board exams for the academic year 2017-18.
 
 All CBSE-affiliated schools have been notified to register their students from Class 9 and 11 on the official website of the CBSE Board by submitting the necessary documents and subject related details. CBSE stated that schools should register online with the board before making submissions of documents for the session 2017-18.
