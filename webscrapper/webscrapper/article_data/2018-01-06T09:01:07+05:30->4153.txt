LUCKNOW: The sweater imbroglio in   continues even as the state battles a  . The state government’s decision of decentralising the process for   hasn’t gone down well with primary schools. Teachers’ associations have, in fact, written to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, criticising the government’s order making   (SMC’s) responsible for purchasing sweaters and making them available to the kids within a month. And for this, they have been given Rs 200 per sweater.

 Terming the government’s orders as ‘Tuglaqi’, Primary Teachers Trained Graduate Association state president Vinay Kumar Singh said, “When the government failed to get a supplier within its price bracket, it made teachers responsible for it. The government has asked teachers to do a non-academic work, that too, when exams are going on.”
 
 UP Primary Teachers’ Association president Dinesh Chandra Sharma said, “How can schools do the work in a month when the government failed to do so even in three months, and that too at Rs 200?’’ He added, “How can teachers undertake the task when the government has not released the funds?’’ UP’s basic education department, through an order dated January 3, asked the SMCs to distribute sweaters to kids, with the price not exceeding Rs 200 per sweater. SMCs have been asked to make the purchase either by way of quotation or by floating a tender. For a bill amounting up to Rs 1 lakh, SMCs, said Singh, will make the purchase using quotations, while for bill above Rs 1lakh, tenders will be floated.
 
 As per the order, block education officers (BEOs) will be held responsible if they fail to ensure quality while purchasing. Principals will be held responsible if samples are not available in school at the time of inspection.
