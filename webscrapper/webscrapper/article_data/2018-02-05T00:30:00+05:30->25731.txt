Bengaluru: The Karnataka State Reserve Police (KSRP) is training its women platoon in unarmed combat, following which they would take over as instructors for young girls from schools and colleges across the state.

 The women cops have already begun training in karate and judo, expected to be completed in a few months. Training begins at 6.15am with a morning run and warm-ups followed by the unarmed combat module.
 
 Currently, there are 120 constables in the first batch of KSRP’s first woman battalion raised in 2017. The recruitment was done in the backdrop of low ratio of women in the reserve police, which was accentuated while managing crowds during protests and riots.
 
 Additional director general of police (KSRP) Bhaskar Rao said, “The idea is not just to train them for their benefit, but to take them to instructor-level. Once they are ready, they can be appointed by the women and child development department to train school and college girls in unarmed combat.”
 
 Pointing out that unlike regular police forces, KSRP personnel have more time, Rao said: “Instead of training and keeping themselves busy at our facility, they can conduct classes. Our objective would be met even if 80 of the 120 turn out to be instructors. They will also be sent for public-speaking classes to communicate what they’ve learnt.”
