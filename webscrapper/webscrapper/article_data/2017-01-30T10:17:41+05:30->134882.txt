BHOPAL: The incident took place at Bardadih police station of the district on January 25. A missing person report was lodged at Kolgawan police station the same day while the kid’s body was recovered from a well in the village on January 26. “We had some clues, but everything became clear after getting the post-mortem report on January 28. The accused Vishwa Pratap alias Sheru, 19, a resident of  , was arrested late in the night and presented before a court on Sunday. He has been sent to jail on judicial remand,” assistant sub-inspector GL Shukla told TOI.

 According to Shukla, the family of the deceased used to live in the house of the accused as tenants and therefore he knew the kid. “On January 25, he took the kid with him on the pretext of doing some work in a nearby farm. He sodomised the kid there and decided to kill him, fearing he may spill the beans. He strangulated the boy with a wire used for fencing. Later, he tied his body with a stone using the same wire and threw it into a well,” he said.
 
 “We had several clues like Sheru was the last person with whom the kid was seen. Several witnesses saw him accompanying the kid before he went missing. The post-mortem report said the kid died before he was thrown into the well. He also had severe injuries in his private parts, which confirmed the motive behind the murder. The accused was arrested and he confessed to the crime during interrogation,” Shukla said.
