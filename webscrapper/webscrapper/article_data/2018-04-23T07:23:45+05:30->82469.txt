SANGRUR: Bodies of a woman and a baby were found stuffed inside a suitcase on board the Dadar-Amritsar Express on Saturday, prompting the government railway police ( ) to start investigations.

 The unidentified bodies were found in bogey number S-4 after some passengers reported about foul smell emanating from an abandoned suitcase after the train crossed the   railway station. As the train reached   railway station, a team of GRP boarded the express train and pulled out the suitcase, in which they found the two bodies. While the cops could not establish the identities of the two, they said the woman appeared to be in her late twenties and the baby girl was four to five-month old. Jagjit  , ASI, GRP, said that the passengers reported foul smell from bogie number S-4 as the train crossed the Nabha railway station.
 
 
 On reaching Dhuri, he, along with a team of cops, entered the said bogie and found the two bodies in the suitcase under seat number 41. He said the cops then shifted the bodies to the mortuary of the Dhuri civil hospital for a post-mortem examination and registered a case under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of IPC.
 
 Jagjit said upon preliminary investigations the cops spotted an injury mark at the back of the head of the woman while it appeared that the baby girl was strangulated. However, only an autopsy of the bodies would establish the exact cause of the death, the GRP cop said.
