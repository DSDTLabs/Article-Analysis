NASHIK: The wait for the MIDC’s new additional industrial estate proposed at Talegaon-Akrale in Dindori tehsil, which was expected to be ready by the end of March, will get longer by six more months.

 The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) is developing the estate on 500 acres at Talegaon-Akrale, barely 18km from here. It is now expected to be ready by September end. The   has started Rs 71-crore infrastructure work, including constructing internal roads, jack-well and pump house and laying of a water pipeline between the new industrial estate and Palkhed dam to supply water to industries. 
 
 An   official said, “The infrastructure projects are in progress and the new estate in Dindori will be ready on 500 acres by the end of September. The industries will get plots thereafter.”
 
 Another official said there were some issues with farmers for land acquisition, but most of the contentions have been sorted.
 
 M G Kulkarni, president of the   unit of Laghu Udyog Bharati, said, “The new estate will definitely attract industrial investment worth Rs 2,000 crore and generate around 5,000 jobs. The Union government is expected to introduce Goods and Services Tax (GST) during 2017-18 financial year. The GST will help attract large investment not from across the country, but also foreign investment.” 
 
 The Satpur and Ambad industrial estates of MIDC in Nashik have been fully occupied and there is no land available for the new industries and existing ones for expansions.
