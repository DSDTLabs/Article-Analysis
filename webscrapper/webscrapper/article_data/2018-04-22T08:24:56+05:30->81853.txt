NEW DELHI: Just amending the constitution as per the Justice (retd) RM Lodha Committee’s recommendations isn’t going to suffice for the state cricket associations. In order to complete the formality, the amended bye-laws will have to be scrutinized first by the   legal team, a   letter addressed to the   (MCA) says.

 
 “In view thereof, please provide a copy of the new constitution of the MCA for scrutiny by the BCCI Legal Team at the earliest. In the meantime, it would not be advisable to hold elections until the amended constitution of the MCA is scrutinized and confirmed to be compliant,” the CoA said in the letter.
 
 It was revealed that despite amending the constitution, MCA was trying to get in some disqualified members who have completed nine years in office from different districts to take part in the state elections.
 
 The recent diktat of CoA means even a state body like the Delhi and District Cricket Association, which is all set for elections after the IPL gets over, would have to follow the same procedure.
 
 On April 7, MCA had amended its constitution and the secretary of the association had issued a notice that the terms of the governing body has ended and till the elections, he would be in-charge of the functioning. 
 
 When TOI spoke to association’s former president  , he said: “My term is over and though I am qualified, I have to go on a cooling off period, which I am happily doing. People can have different interpretations and I have no comments to offer on that. The MCA secretary is the only office-bearer today and he can give you the details."
 
 Incidentally, it was Apte who took the lead to implement the Lodha reforms and was keen to follow the rules and regulations laid down by CoA.
