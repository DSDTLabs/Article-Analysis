Mangaluru: Move to   high value currency taken by PM Narendra Modi purportedly to tackle ‘black’ money has taken India’s economy back by 20 years. With the 50-day-deadline sought by PM to bear with inconveniences caused by the move having ended on December 30 and people still suffering, Congress will no longer wait or give PM additional time and will intensify its agitation against the Union government across the nation henceforth, sais Ivan D’Souza.

 Stating this, Ivan D’Souza, chief whip of the government in state legislative council told reporters on Saturday that the nation is no longer interested in PM’s assurances and pleas on this count. “We do not want his Mann Ki Baat, launch of BHIM app or any such measures. The PM must remove all curbs placed on withdrawal of money – either at the bank branches or at ATMs as it was before November 8, keeping in mind that India is not yet ready to go  , he said.
 
 Modi is testing people’s patience. The effect of this move can be seen at the grassroots level, he said, adding PM is directly responsible for their plight. Dubbing the demonetization move as a foolish step on part of Modi, Ivan said the government has not addressed the issue of circulation of fake currency that it intended to do with this move.
 
 Assailing the PM for shifting the goalposts on the demonetization move from tackling black money to going cashless, Ivan said 85% of India’s population deals with cash and does not have the wherewithal to go cashless. The penetration of smartphone and internet connection in India is poor to spur the transition to a cashless society and this move will not bring the perceived benefits to Indian economy, he noted. Ibrahim Kodijal, in-charge DCC president, was present.
