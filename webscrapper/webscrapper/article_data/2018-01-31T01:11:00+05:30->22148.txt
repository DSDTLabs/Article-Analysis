Coimbatore: In an effort to take precautionary measures to tackle wild fire, the forest department has come up with a slew of arrangements ahead of summer. 

 The contingency plan includes making fire lines in seven forest ranges, recruitment of 16 fire watchers to prevent or douse the fire. Furthermore, as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), a private firm has given three devices to the department to smother  .
 
 S Ramasubramanian, Conservator of Forests, Coimbatore circle explains, “Since there is a chance of forest fire during January –May, we have made fire lines for 102 kms. Also, fire lines of three metre width and five kilometer length are made in vulnerable areas in the reserve forest.” 
 
 “We are following traditional methods to tame the fire by using green bushes. We have also got three devices developed by a private firm to tame the forest fire and hope those would greatly help the fire watchers in extinguishing the fire,” he further said.
 
 He also added that department has planned to provide 15 more devices each to the seven forest ranges in Coimbatore circle.
 
 N Satheesh, District Forest Officer, Coimbatore forest division told TOI that many forest fire incidents have been reported in Chadivayal, Kuridimalai, Mangalapalayam, Annanthambi Malai. Additionally, frequent fire outbreaks have happened in forest ranges coming under Boluvampatti, Mettupalayam, Coimbatore, Madukkarai, Sirumugai, Periyanaickenpalayam from February 2017 – May 2017.
 
 “The forest fire engulfs 34.91 hectares of forest land in six forest ranges in Coimbatore forest division. However no fire incident was reported from Karamadai forest range. Sixteen fire watchers have started to make fire lines in Madukkarai and Boluvampatti. Since maximum incidents were reported in Boluvampatti, we are paying more attention to the area,” Satheesh said.
 
 Conservator of Forests Ramasubramanian said that the department will recruit more fire watchers if needed.
