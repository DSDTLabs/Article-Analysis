NEW DELHI: Stock market on Thursday morning made an encouraging start in its bid to break away from the looming pressure on the Street.

 The benchmark indices opened sedate but firmed up steadily as   extended gains to more than 400 points. At 10.53 am, the BSE index was up 435 points on 34,518.   too went past the 10,500-mark and was trading 123.50 points higher than previous closing mark. Both the indices were gaining more than a per cent.
 
 Brokers said buying by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) and a mixed trend at other Asian bourses improved the market sentiment. In the Asian region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.48 per cent while Japan's Nikkei higher 0.26 per cent in early trade today. Shanghai Composite Index, however, shed 0.81 per cent.
 
 The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended marginally lower by 0.08 per cent yesterday.
 
 The markets have been gripped with negative sentiments since the turn of this month on back of   announcements, weak global cues and fiscal slippage. On Wednesday, the indices extended their losing streak to seven days. Investors would be hoping that the market has undergone sufficient correction. 
 
 In Thursday's morning trade, all sectoral sub-indices with the exception of Nifty metal were in the green. Pharma stocks were rallying the most with the sector sub-inde gaining almost 2.5 per cent. Bank, financial service and IT stocks were also making handsome gains. 
 
 Cipla, Infosys and major oil stocks were the leading scrips.
