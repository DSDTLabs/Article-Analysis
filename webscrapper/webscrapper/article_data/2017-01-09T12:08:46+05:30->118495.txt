SURAT: Police recovered the body of a young man from a car in   area of the city on Saturday. 

 The man was on driver’s seat when locals spotted the car on VIP Road. The car is not registered in the victim’s name, police said, adding that they are trying to find out the vehicle’s owner. 
 
 Deceased Alpesh Rupkumar Mehta, 34, a resident of a township at Adajan, was a textile businessman. Mehta, who left home on Friday morning, had talked to his wife last in the evening over phone. Family members told police that   did not talk about any extraneous or business issues. 
 
 The body was sent for postmortem and the police are yet to get the report giving the exact cause behind Mehta’s death. “The exact reason behind his death is not yet known. We are awaiting the postmortem report to know the exact reason. We are yet to investigate the circumstances that caused his death,” said M S  , deputy commissioner of police. 
 
 In another case, the severed head of an 18-year-old teenager was recovered from Pandesara area of the city. The head was wrapped in a piece of paper and was found from an open plot near Swapna Shrushti Society. Police are checking complaints of missing persons to establish the identity of the deceased. 
 
 Preliminary investigation revealed that the body was slit with a sharp-edged weapon. However, police are yet not certain if the deceased was killed at some other location and later the head thrown at the open land. 
 
 The head was partially decomposed. Hence, the police suspect that the teenager may have been killed at least three days ago. “We have started investigation to identify the deceased. We are checking reports of missing persons to trace the family of the deceased,” Bhabhor said.
