Varanasi: The unused medicines kept in   at homes awaiting the date of expiry could now be used. A ' ' has been placed at   (SSL) Hospital with the purpose of serving the needy patients. 

 The initiative was started by a third year student of faculty of medicine,   (IMS), BHU, Kameshwar Mishra.
 
 "We often keep medicines which are no longer of use because we either recuperate quicker than anticipated or forget to consume them. These medicines remain in boxes and are thrown after the expiry date. I then decided to place a box in the hospital where unused medicines could be dropped for the needy patient."
 
 The drop box was inaugurated by SSL medical superintendent Dr OP Upadhyay. It has the donation instructions pasted over it and also informs how to procure the medicines. The patients can also put a photocopy of their prescription and BPL card in the box along with the phone number.
 
 Mishra said that four more drop boxes will be placed near Emergency gate, outside  , near registration counter and the Ayurvedic OPD. The box would be emptied every Sunday morning. The medicines would be classified and given to the needy patients.
