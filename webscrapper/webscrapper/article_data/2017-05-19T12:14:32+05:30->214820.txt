THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With a few more days remaining for the  , the city police have ordered the drivers of vehicles   to register with the city traffic police.

 Drivers have been asked to furnish the documents of their vehicles, driving licences and police clearance certificates at the traffic police station.
 
 The order was issued as part of creating a registry of vehicles ferrying school students. The vehicles would now have a registration number, as part of a bid to regularize the service of private vehicles and also to make drivers accountable for their actions.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) Arul B Krishna said each parallel service vehicle ferrying school students would be given a specific registration number.
 
 The service operators must display the registration number on their vehicles for easy identification.
 
 ‘’This is to make inspections easier. If an officer spots a vehicle displaying the sticker with the registration number, he will recognize it as an authorised vehicle,’’ the DCP said, adding that the police were hoping to make the registration number compulsory for conducting the service.
 
 According to a directive issued by the district collector in 2011, the driver of a student transport vehicle must have at least 10 years’ of driving experience.
 
 The district administration and the police started giving emphasis to regularise the private transport services after the Karikkakom school van tragedy in February 2011, which killed six kindergarten students and an ayah.
 
 The vehicle was driven by a 19-year-old man
