HYDERABAD: Ever heard of an IPS officer do hard labour as a construction worker? On Sunday, 47-year-old R S Praveen Kumar did just that. The country, in fact, is raving about him as the man who mentored   climb the Everest. Praveen Kumar’s role has been essayed by producer-director-actor   in ‘Poorna’ that got released last week.

 His portrayal on the big screen notwithstanding, Praveen Kumar, who is the secretary of   Social Welfare Residential Educational Institutions Society, did not allow his fame on the big screen to affect his down-to-earth behaviour. Joining volunteers of ‘Swaero’ who are alumni of social welfare institutions, the IPS officer carried cement, bricks and construction material to help construct a house of a family in  .
 
 “I spent my Sunday in construction of New home in Warangal for the family of Sireesha who died of dengue last year. Her family is living in abject poverty and I am surprised their hut doesn't even have walls and floor. Absolutely sub-human,” the IPS officer said.
 
 “It is mandatory for Swaeroes to help the poorest, construct/repair their homes in our Holy Month,” he said thanking all who ‘offered their sweat today.’
