After side-stepping questions on film-maker   for too long, director   has finally addressed her relationship with Woody, who she worked with on 2012's  .

  
  
  In an interview, the 34-year-old film-maker has declared that she will not work with the 'Midnight in Paris' helmer in the future.
 
  The   filmmaker expressed her regret for acting in Allen's 2012 romantic comedy 'To Rome with Love'.
 
  She also referenced  , Allen's adoptive daughter, who has been outspoken against Allen in recent years and accused him of sexual assault.
 
  She said, "I can only speak for myself and what I've come to is this: If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film. I have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again. Dylan Farrow's two different pieces made me realize that I increased another woman's pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization."
 
  Farrow has written multiple essays alleging that Woody Allen sexually abused her as a child, and recently criticised some members of the #TimesUp movement for overlooking her accusations.
 
  Allen's son,  , who recently wrote about the sexual misconduct allegations against   producer  , supported his sister claims.
 
  Refuting the claims, the 78-year-old American screenwriter lashed out at his former wife   and revealed that he loved her and hopes that one day she will grasp how she has been cheated out of having a loving father and exploited by a mother more interested in her own festering anger than her daughter's well-being.
