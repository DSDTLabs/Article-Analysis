  “It was a new channel and every serial was struggling for ratings. But there was no complaint about the quality and content of Girija Kalyana,“ he said.
  
  Though he was promised that the story would be taken to a conclusion, he says it does not matter.
  
  “It does not matter whether the story concludes or not. The one line story given to me was `there is a couple who do not have children. So the man marries for a second time. But even the second wife does not bear kids.They get a boon from Lord Shiva and have a girl child after 14 years. The girl is destined to die at the age of 18 but will survive if the tasks given by Shiva is completed.' It has been developed from there. So it does not matter.“
  
  Naveen also wrote dialogues for the serial. He is, however, positive about his future. “When I was offered the serial, it was new to me.It was due to   that I got the offer. After having directed nearly 150 episodes, the confidence in me is immense. I now know that I can direct films and serials of any scale. My life experiences to create stories are little, but I can develop any small idea into a big one,“ he said.
