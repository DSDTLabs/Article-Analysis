Nearly 60% of   plying on Indian roads are uninsured, a majority of them  . Of the 50 lakh vehicles in  , over 45% are uninsured, said   (Traffic), A V Ranganath. A majority of them are two-wheelers as most bike owners fail to   periodically, he added.

 While getting a vehicle insured is mandatory at the time of purchase, many people do not renew their insurance. The data is by the General Insurance Council (GIC). Around 19 crore vehicles were registered in India in 2015-16, of which only 8.26 crore were insured, said GIC secretary general R Chandrasekaran recently.
 
 The situation was similar in 2012-13, when the total number of vehicles, including two wheelers, cars and heavy vehicles in the country, was 15 crore. Of this, only 6.02 crore vehicles were insured.
 
 The figures are alarming given the number of road accidents in the country . In 2015, over 5 lakh accidents occurred in the country, of which 1.31 lakh were fatal. As many as 1.46 lakh citizens were killed while more than 5 lakh were injured. Twowheelers were involved in 29% of the accidents, cars and jeeps in 23% and buses in 8.3%. Many motorists involved in these accidents lost out on insurance payments.
 
 Transport experts point out the need for every vehicle to be insured as those without an insurance cause “huge liability to mishap victims“.
 
 Transport expert Rishi Aggarwal said, “Some citizens who have had accident-free rides for three to four years become reluctant to renew or buy new policies.“
 
 The only way out of this problem is stricter checks for insurance papers on the lines of drink driving checks, DCP Ranganath said.
 
 
 
 That most vehicles plying on roads are uninsured is nothing short of alarming. Motorists and bikers must realise that vehicle insurance is not a burden, but security against possible accidents. Also, the police and the RTO must make it a point to ask for the document while conducting traffic campaigns.
