PUNE:   on Thursday said he will request chief minister   and state finance minister   to hold likely increase in ready reckoner (RR) rates.

 In a district-level meeting, which was attended by Bapat, MLAs, MP Anil Shirole and district collector, it was proposed that there should be no increase in the RR rates. The committee gives its recommendations ahead of the announcement in April by the Inspectorate General of Registration and Controller of Stamps.
 
 “Considering the present market scenario, it is not advisable to increase the RR rates even if this means a deficit to the exchequer. We simply should not burden the citizens,“ Bapat said in the meeting. He added that he will have a detailed meeting with the chief minister regarding the issue.
 
 The district-level meeting was to be conducted in January, but was delayed due to the election and code of conduct.District collector Saurabh Rao told TOI that the elected representatives and town planning officials have come up with the recommendation to not increase the RR rates. “I will be sending the suggestions and recommendations to the government,“ Rao said. A discussion was held about a possibility of an 11% hike in RR rates for Pune, including both corporations and rural areas.This was opposed by the elected representatives.
 
 Discussions were also held for a 6% hike in RR rates for corporation areas and nearly 20% hike for rural areas.However, these too failed to cut ice with the elected representatives, sources said.
 
 Pune MP Anil Shirole said this was the preliminary discussion and would be followed by another meeting.“It is not necessary to increase the RR rates every year. On one hand, the Union government is pushing for the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for affordable housing and on the other hand we propose to increase the RR rates. This will definitely affect the people and it should be reconsidered.“ he said.
