JALANDHAR: The Punjab government’s second mega farmers’ debt waiver function will be held on March 14 at Nakodar where around 40,000 farmers from six districts of Punjab would get   certificates.

 Punjab chief minister   will hand over these certificates to the farmers. This waiver would be for those who had availed crop loans from the cooperative banks through co-operative societies.
 
 
 It is learnt that earlier, the state government had intended to hold the function at Shahkot, where a by-election is to be held after the seat fell vacant with demise of MLA Ajit  . However, a suitable place could not be found after which the officials zeroed in on the neighbouring constituency Nakodar, which has a sprawling grain market on the Nakodar-Moga main road.
 
 
 Sources said, the MLAs and constituency in-charges have also been involved in the exercise unlike the first loan waiver function held at Mansa on January 7, which hit headlines for wrong reasons too, as the exercise was left to the official machinery alone and it had later come out that several deserving farmers had been left out. Now, while the co-operative societies have identified the deserving farmers, the MLAs are working as facilitators to ensure that deserving farmers don’t feel hassled, they added.
 
 
 According to information, the MLAs have already received the lists and their offices are also reaching out to the beneficiaries. “Moreover, it would also help them score points among the electorate,” said a ruling party MLA.
 
 The districts which have been included for the loan waiver this time include Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Moga, Ludhiana, Ferozepur and Fazilka.
 
 
 On Friday, additional chief secretaries of the state, D P Reddy and   reviewed the preparations for the function. They held marathon discussions with the officers of the district administration regarding the function. The senior officers also inspected the site where pandal for this mega event.
