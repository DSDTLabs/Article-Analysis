AHMEDABAD: Senior state government ministers along with  ,  , will lay foundation stone for a   near   (GFSU) campus in Gandhinagar on Monday. The lab is a joint project of GFSU and Canada-based Kinetrics Inc. Officials said it would be first such facility for forensic testing of conductors used in power generation and transmission.

 Speaking about the $ 1.7 million project, Dr JM Vyas, director general, GFSU, said that the firm had an MoU with GFSU for the purpose in VGGIS 2017. “Conductor failure is a major issue for power generation and distribution sector worldwide. So far, the facilities are available for testing of low-power conductors. But with the collaboration, we will be able to analyze high-power conductors and identity causes for failure,” he said.
 
 GFSU officials said that the forensic analysis will identify glitches, helping better power distribution and reducing power leakage — thus making the system more efficient. “At the moment, the conductors are sent abroad for testing. But with a lab within the country, the delay will be drastically reduced for power generating facilities,” said the official, adding that it will also help train forensic experts in this specialized field. Construction of the lab would commence soon.
