INDORE: Land of the Holkars was left divided with the advent of new Kings and Royals. The stadium stands witnessed a rare division in fan-base on Sunday during the second IPL match on Sunday. However at the end, ‘the home rulers’ outdid the Royals from Rajasthan both on and off the field.

 As the match progressed, number of Rajasthan Royals fans turned out to be mere sprinkle in the red sea that flooded the stadium. 
 
 Fans dressed in red and blue stormed the stadium well before the match began. With some early wickets, the home team drew first blood making the crowd go wild. Chants of ‘Punjab-Punjab’ kept reverberating in the stands that continued till the end of the game. 
 
 Fans danced to the tunes of DJ playing songs like Afghan Jalebi and other punjabi tracks. 
 
 At around 7.30pm, a group of young   were found sporting   jerseys with red turbans. “We love KXIP and want KXIP to set the ground on fire today. The music here is amazing and we can’t wait for the match to begin,” they said in chorus. 
 
 However, there were some who came to support the members of Team India. “How can we pray for Ajinkya Rahane or   to get out cheaply in a match? They are players of Team India. It’s always a pleasure to watch them bat. No matter who they play for, we will be happy with whoever wins,” said Sneha Paul, a third year student. She had come with her friend Arpan, who was wearing the Indian jersey. 
 
 Meanwhile the DJ kept the mood alive playing poppy dance numbers, from Abhi to party shuru hui hai to Larki beautiful kar gayi chull. 
 
 The ‘Punjab Punjab’ chants took over as the wickets kept tumbling. Poor performance by Rajasthan Royals, especially  , and better fielding and bowling by KXIP than the previous match became the hot topic of discussion for spectators with Rajasthan Royals losing wickets at regular intervals.
