Guru  , who made his debut as a music director in K-Town with the film  , has now come up with a song that celebrates the bond between actor   and his fans. He says he got the idea after Vijay fans spread the word online of a song he had composed based on a poem by Pazhani Bharathi. “Pazhani Bharathi has written many songs for Vijay during the star’s formative years, in films like Poove Unakkaga, Once More and Kadhalukku Mariyadhai. And Vijay fans still remember that and celebrate him just because he was associated with their idol. This aspect of theirs impressed me. Plus, they also seem to be doing a lot of social work. These prompted me to compose a song as a tribute to them,” says  , who managed to rope in   himself for writing the lyrics of the song, which is titled Ilaya Thalapathy Rasigan Daa. 

 For the video, a dance group in Coimbatore called Step Up Tamil Pasanga, who are ardent fans of the Ilayathalapathy, came forward to choreograph the moves. “The visuals will be that of Vijay, his fans celebrating his movies and the dancers,” the composer adds. The song, whose teaser was released on Women’s Day, will be released online tomorrow.
