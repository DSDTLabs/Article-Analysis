 In a letter written to the chairman of  , a non-profit organisation based out of Bengaluru, IPS Roopa had said her 'conscience' does not permit her to accept the reward.
 
 "Every government servant is expected to maintain neutrality and equidistance from all quasi-political bodies and associations that have even the bare minimum political overtone. Only then a public servant can maintain a clean and fair image in the eyes of the public," read Roopa's letter.
 
 "It becomes all the more relevant now in the view of the ensuing elections," added Roopa.
