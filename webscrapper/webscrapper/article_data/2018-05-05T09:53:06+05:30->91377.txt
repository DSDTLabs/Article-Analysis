LUCKNOW: Responding to the attack by   minister Ramvilas Pawan,   chief Mayawati on Friday instead accused him of being an anti-Dalit, and said that the attitude of   ministers is embarrassingly ‘servile’ and anti-SC/ST.

 
 A day after Paswan had accused Mayawati of having diluted the SC/ST Act during her tenure as UP CM, the BSP chief said such statements would not be able to erase or diminish in any way the great work done by her party for the uplift of Dalits.
 
 “Nobody would believe that the SC/ST Act was weakened by BSP government. In fact, BSP worked so much for Dalits, backwards, tribals, Muslims and poor from upper castes that its term has been mentioned in the golden pages of India’s history,” she said.
 
 Accusing the   government of doing politics for its electoral gains, Mayawati said one should not expect any comprehensive plan for public good from a party which has such narrow mindset. “Despite the severe storm which caused massive destruction in north India, the central and BJP governments in   and UP have been extremely careless and irresponsible,” she said.
