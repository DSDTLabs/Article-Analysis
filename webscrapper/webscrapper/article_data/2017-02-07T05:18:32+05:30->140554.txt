MUMBAI: Yet again, delays are expected to mar the online admission for seats reserved under the  , 2009. With city schools not completing the registration process by the February 3 deadline, and a few technical glitches, the state could not start accepting online applications from February 5 as per the original schedule. Officials said that the application portal is expected to start only by Wednesday. 

 On Monday evening, 336 unaided non-minority schools had registered for the online admission process. Officials from   said they could not move to the next step unless all schools complete registration. "A handful of non-state board schools have not registered for the process. If we do not get them on board now, they might get away with not reserving seats," said an official. 
 
 All unaided, non-minority schools in the city have to set aside 25% seats at the entry level for students from economically weaker sections. Also, the state could not open the applications for parents due to glitches. "This time there are changes in the online process and so there were technical glitches which needed to be addressed before the site was opened for parents. Online applications could start by February 8," he said. 
 
 Activists will protest on Tuesday to demand that the state reverse new rules for admissions. "These rules allow schools to pick the entry level and most schools are stating it as class I. This way, no student will get admission to pre-primary as this section is unregulated," said Sudhir Paranjpe,  .
