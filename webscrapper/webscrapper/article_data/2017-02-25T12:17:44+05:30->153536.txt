COIMBATORE: The   and Hospital (CMCH) on Friday refuted reports that close to 40   patients were undergoing treatment there and said only 34 for patients were getting treatment for the flu. “Only three of 34 are tested positive for the virus,” they said.

 Earlier this week, the number of patients undergoing treatment for H1N1 in the CMCH had touched 39, forcing it to move some patients to the fever ward or a step down intensive care unit. The number had come down to 34 as on Thursday evening.
 
 Sources, however, said the numbers were higher. “As the H1N1 ward is full, many patients are shifted to the fever wards and a room near the ICU,” said a doctor. “Even now, suspected cases are being treated for the virus in those wards but they are not counted. Only patients in the H1N1 ward get reported,” he said.
 
 Hospital authorities said there were 34 patients as on Friday night -- 29 from Coimbatore and the remaining from Erode and  . “The figure is inclusive of all patients being treated for the flu in all wards,” said resident medical officer, Dr A Soundaravel. A majority of the patients were from the southern part of the city, including Madukkarai, Eachanari and Podanur, and others from   and Singanallur.
 
 With the health department refusing to divulge the number of H1N1 patients, there are reports that the virus has been rapidly spreading. The department had also asked private hospitals not to give the numbers.
