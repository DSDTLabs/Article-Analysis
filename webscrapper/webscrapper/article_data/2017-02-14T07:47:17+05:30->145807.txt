KOLKATA: Left and Congress MLAs came together once again and boycotted the   discussion on Monday to protest against the forcible eviction of two lady members -Pratima Rajak of Congress and   of CPM -when speaker Biman Banerjee had asked the marshal to take leader of the opposition   out of the House during a debate on the controversial Maintenance of Public Order (Amendment) Bill five days ago on February 8. Mannan is recuperating in a city hospital still.

 Opposition MLAs other than BJP took the protest route after the assembly speaker tur ned down their demand to hold an immediate discussion on the attack on the lady members at the onset of the question hour. Protesting members continued with the din even as minister   kept requesting the opposition not to come in the way of the question hour. The opposition staged a walkout and later decided to participate in the budget discussions on Tuesday wearing posters against the “dastardly attack“ on the opposition leader and two lady members.
 
 “We will wear aprons carrying photographs of Abdul Mannan being manhandled by the assembly security staff. Let the Speaker suspend all of us,“ said Congress MLA Manoj Chakrabarty .
