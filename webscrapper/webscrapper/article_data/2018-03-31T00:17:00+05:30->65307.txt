Pune: Office-bearers of the Obesity Surgery Society of India ( ) on Friday refuted the allegations made by the city’s prominent woman surgeon against the senior bariatric surgeons.

 “There was no personal issue between them (the surgeons) and her as they were investigating on behalf of the society. As a society, we refute all the allegations. We feel that the allegations are motivated, concocted and baseless,” stated a press release issued by the organization’s president, Arun Prasad, and the secretary, Praveen Raj.
 
 The woman surgeon and the senior bariatric surgeons are members of OSSI — the national body of bariatric surgeons.
 
 The woman surgeon on Thursday lodged a complaint with the Samarth police accusing the six senior surgeons — three from Delhi and one each from Mumbai, Hyderabad and Pune — of Rs20 lakh extortion bid besides, defaming and roughing her up.
 
 The six senior surgeons are respected members with great reputation, the release stated. “Two of them have been assigned the responsibility by the general body of OSSI to investigate an issue related to financial irregularities in the organization of IFSO-APC 2017 conference in Goa, of which she was the organizing secretary. We respect their contributions to the society and stand by them,” it stated.
 
 The woman surgeon said, “I have not said anything against the OSSI. Besides, I am not refuting the contribution of the six members. My grievances are they used lewd language, intimidated me and tried to extort money. They defamed me so that I could not contest election for the post of vice-president of OSSI.”
 
 She said, “All of them are diverting the topic by talking about financial discrepancies. I had submitted the audit report in October last year. They raised the issue in January when they learnt I was contesting the poll. I still don’t understand what threat I would have posed to them, if I were elected on the post?”
