BENGALURU: Land developer  , 78, was standing next to his son   G, 34, when the latter shot his wife's friend twice on Friday, police said. 

 Rajesh was tailing his wife  , 32, and her advocate-friend  , 34, from   in their SUV. On seeing the duo having parked their car near Acharya Group of Institutions, off Hesaraghatta, Rajesh decided to confront them, police said. 
 
  Driver stood near vehicle: "Rajesh asked driver Kumar to park the car near his wife's vehicle. Accordingly, Kumar drove past Shruthi's car and stopped," investigating officials said. Rajesh, who was sitting next to Kumar, jumped out of the vehicle with a revolver in his pocket and Gopalakrishna, sitting in the back seat, followed his son. Driver Kumar, a key eyewitness, stood near the vehicle. Police are still recording the statements of both Rajesh and Kumar. 
 
 "As Rajesh went near Shruthi's car, Gopalakrishna followed his son, and saw him shoot Amith," officials added.
 
 After the shooting, Shruthi drove Amith to a hospital where he was declared brought dead, while the father-son duo went to Madanayakanahalli police station to surrender. Within an hour of Amith's death, Shruthi was found hanging from the ceiling fan of a lodge in the area.
 
 "We had a tough time convincing Rajesh about Shruthi's suicide. When we broke the news at 6.45pm, he did not believe us. We then showed him the photo of her body and switched on the TV channel reporting her death," police said. "It took more than 30 minutes for Rajesh and his father to realize that Shruthi was no more," police added.
