NEW DELHI: The government on Monday said it was working on a new Ganga Act, which will be shared with states concerned before being tabled in Parliament, to lay down guidelines for cleaning the river and implement the ‘Namami Gange’ programme. 

 With opposition MPs attacking the government in RS for achieving “zilch” in rejuvenating the Ganga over the last three years, water resources minister Uma Bharati said the results of various initiatives taken by the Centre to clean the river would begin to show results from 2018 onwards.
 
 Much to the amusement of the opposition benches,   member Basawaraj Patil Sedam (Karnataka) told Bharati and her junior minister   Balyan that “if plans are formulated ‘hawa mein’ (in the air), then you do not get the desired results” while asking a supplementary question to the latter.
