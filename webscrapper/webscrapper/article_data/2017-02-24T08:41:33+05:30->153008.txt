JALANDHAR: Wife and daughter-in-law of a   and a family friend were shot dead in their house by   in   on Thursday evening.

 Family head Jagdish Singh and his son Amarinder Singh were not at home when the incident took place. The motive behind the murders is yet to be ascertained. Police said the incident came to light when Amarinder Singh came home around 5.30pm and rang the bell. As nobody responded, he raised an alarm and broke open the door with the help of neighbours.
 
 They found the bodies of Amarinder's mother Daljit Kaur, 60, and wife Paramjit Kaur, 40, lying in a pool of blood. Paramjit's friend Khushwinder Kaur Neetu, 40, a resident of Link Colony, who was a frequent visitor at the house, was lying unconscious. She was taken to a private hospital but succumbed to injuries later.
 
 Forensic experts have examined the house. Cops said the back door was open when they reached the spot. However, no neighbor had heard the gunshots.
 
 Even though garments were pulled out of the almirahs, valuables like jewellery and cash were not missing. "No valuable has been taken away. They were shot from a very close range," said ACP (Central) Manpreet Singh Dhillon. Cops said a .32 revolver was used in the crime as they found empty shells of the bullets.
 
 Police questioned the family's maid, Reena, who revealed that there was tension in the family over some issue.
 
 Amarinder told the cops that they earlier owned a   but that was sold off and the family is now running a factory.
