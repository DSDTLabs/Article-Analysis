NEW DELHI: A mother-son duo has been arrested allegedly for cheating about 1,000   of Rs 2 crore by promising to send them to the US or an European country for studies or jobs. 

 The victims were asked to pay a handsome amount for visa applications and handed over fake appointment letters following which the accused used to disappear with the money, the police said.
 
 DCP (northwest) Aslam Khan said some of the complainants had approached the   police station with a complaint about the duo last week. “A team led by Saraswati Vihar ACP Raja Bainthia was formed and it was found that the   was operating the business from an office near a business complex. The woman and one of her sons were tracked down and caught from a house in Vidyapathi Nagar,” said DCP Khan.
 
 The probe revealed that the company, Mastech Experts, was being run by Madhuri Sharma and her   Vishal and cousin Ashok. They used to put up advertisments and promised applicants jobs and study opportunities in Germany, Canada and Australia. The victim had to deposit money for visa and consultancy following which an appointment letter or an admission letter would be given to them along with a fake visa. However, when the applicant tried to book a ticket, they found the visa and the application letter to be fake.
 
 The woman told cops that initially they opened a call centre in the name of   at Rohini. However, the business had flopped due to their extravagent lifestyle. Following this they took to cheating and fled the city after collecting enough money. After fleeing from Delhi, they settled in Pune and started running a business under the name of Overseas Immigration Consultant in the similar fashion. They returned to Delhi a few days ago. 
 
 The police have recovered Rs 60 lakh from the mother-son duo and are looking for Ashok.
