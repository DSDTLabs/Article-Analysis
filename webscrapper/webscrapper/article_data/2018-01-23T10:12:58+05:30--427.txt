PANAJI: Politicians and a cross-section of villagers recently rallied against the inclusion of St   in the proposed Bambolim planning area. They said the move would be detrimental to their interests and that the village development committee’s comprehensive plan was enough to ensure growth.

 Although St Cruz MLA  , and sarpanch Mariano Araujo, had earlier supported the inclusion on the grounds that it would boost creation of a road network and development, they expressed their opposition to the proposal at a public meeting. While Fernandes said he would strive to ensure the notification was revoked, Araujo conceded his mistake in passing a resolution to support the inclusion without consulting the villagers, but announced that another one had been passed declaring withdrawal of support.
 
 Former MLA Victoria Fernandes, despite being unwell, said she would fight till her last breath to oppose the town and country planning department’s proposal. “No one should dare destroy our beautiful village,” she said.
 
 Even as villagers unanimously objected to the non-transparent process of the PDA plan,   convener  , said, “There is no scientific basis and reasoning in the vertical development of areas in the name of decongesting city areas.” 
 
 Fr   said that chaos had ensued due to the government’s double standards, while environmentalist Nandakumar Kamat, said the battle against PDA inclusion could be won through people’s unity.
