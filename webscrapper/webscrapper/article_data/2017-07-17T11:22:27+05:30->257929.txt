  "I auditioned for 'Fresh Prince', and they told me I was too short to play Will's girlfriend only for me to become his wife!" Jada said on TV show "Extra".
  
  The "Magic Mike XXL" star said after she found success as a movie star the creators invited her back to the show, but she turned down the offer.
  
  "You know, once I got on my feet, and you know I was doing my thing... I had done a couple of movies and I did 'Different World', then 'Fresh Prince' wanna come back and be like, 'We need you on the show.' I was like, 'No, I'm a movie star, I don't have time'," Jada said.
