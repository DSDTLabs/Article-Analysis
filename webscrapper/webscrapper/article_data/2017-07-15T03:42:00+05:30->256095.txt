Panaji: Aside from the rough seas currently preventing former Haryana minister Gopal Kanda’s casino vessel entering River Mandovi, other factors have also given rise to uncertainty over the casino’s functioning. Though the Captain of Ports may have permitted MV Lucky Seven to moor itself at Verem bay, the vessel has yet to complete the registration process and only once the vessel is registered under the Inland Vessels Act, will the casino be allowed to operate, said officials.  Captain of Ports James Braganza on Friday pointed out that the vessel had been allowed to enter the river purely on the directives of the high court of Bombay at Goa. “It has been allowed in as a refuge vessel,” Braganza told TOI. A port of refuge is a port or place that a ship diverts to when her captain considers it unsafe to continue the voyage due to a peril. Golden Globe Hotels had petitioned the high court of Bombay to direct the Goa government to allow the vessel to move to River Mandovi as the vessel, which was anchored at MPT, was “being damaged due to the high saline content”. Captain of Port officials also pointed out that the registration of MV Lucky Seven was still in process and that till then the vessel would not be able to open its doors to patrons. Advocate general Dattaprasad Lawande had earlier informed the court that the vessel needs the registration with Captain of Port under the Inland Vessels Act.
