GHAZIABAD: The work on a section of the 10.3-km UP Gate-Rajnagar Extension   passing over Vasundhara   will begin shortly after midnight on Wednesday. The railways has given the   a four-hour window daily from September 27 to 30 to wrap up the work.

 “We have already completed 85% of work on the elevated road. However, the work near Vasundhara railway crossing has been hanging fire since the railways had not given us permission to work. Now that we have got the permission, we will start the work from Wednesday midnight,” said A K Gupta, officiating chief engineer, GDA. “We will try to wrap up the work before 4am. Since we have been given time till only September 30, we are making all efforts to finish the work within the stipulated time,” he added. 
 
 The GDA has paid the railways Rs 8.26 crore for drawing and design approval of the elevated road on this section. The work for the elevated road started in November 2014 and the completion date was set for April 29 this year. However, the issues with multiple agencies which had a stake in the project such as irrigation, forest, railways and irrigation departments delayed the work. 
 
 Last year, the NGT had briefly stayed the work on a section of elevated road stating that a few pillars of the road were passing through the ‘Arthala bird sanctuary’ in violation of environmental laws.
 
 Being constructed at a cost of Rs 1,248 crore, the six-lane elevated road is touted as the longest one to be built on a single pier. It is being built on 282 piers all through 10.3 km of elevated structure from UP Gate to Rajnagar extension. Once complete, the road will reduce travel time to a mere 10 minutes as opposed to the 45 minutes it takes for commuters to brave massive traffic jams currently.
