SHAHKOT ( ): Punjab local bodies’ minister Navjot Singh   started canvassing for the Congress in the Shahkot constituency on Wednesday, just four days before end of the campaigning. He took his attacks on Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president   and   to a new level with his wit and inimitable style.

 Addressing his first public meeting at Tanwandi Madho in the constituency, which was attended by people from other villages too, he attacked Badals and Bikram Singh Majithia. He also mentioned special task force (STF) report to target Majithia and claimed drugs had gripped Punjab during the 10-year SAD-BJP rule and ‘chitta’ was all around.
 
 He said if he would get more years in life and more power then he would ensure that Majithia would go to jail. “Either I’ll survive or you’ll survive,” Sidhu said.
 
 He also attacked former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal for not campaigning in Shahkot. “He is not entering the campaigning as he has nothing to tell people that what he did for them in the last 10 years during his rule,” he said. Sidhu also took on Union minister Harsimrat Badal on the issue of GST on langar, saying she wanted to become a martyr by threatening to resign when even less than a year was left for Lok Sabha election.
 
 While SAD has been attacking Congress nominee Hardev Singh Laddi Sherowalia on the issue of sand mining, Sidhu accused the Opposition party of causing huge losses to the state as sand mafia ruled the trade. He said that they had created economic terrorism in the state.
 
 He also dared Sukhbir to hold a public debate with him or Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar or Jalandhar Cantontment MLA Pargat Singh.
