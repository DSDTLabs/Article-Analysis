Lucknow: As the crucial deadline of July 31 for registration of builders under the new real estate regulation Act (RERA) nears, builders in   and the state government did not seem to be on the same page. While builders voiced their concern, saying that UP was not RERA-ready in the absence of the all-important regulator, the state government refuted the charge, claiming that the Real Estate Regulatory Authority is in place in UP and developers are aware of it.

 The builders voiced their opinion at a conference—UP Ahead—by the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India ( ) here on Saturday.
 
 Principal secretary, housing, Mukul Singhal told TOI that despite July 31 being the last date to register under RERA, only two out of around 1,000 developers in UP have registered so far.
 
 Of this, 400 prominent builders are members of CREDAI-UP, which is one of the apex builders’ associations in India. Its members complained that neither they have been briefed about the registration process, nor the government has made any RERA website to register.
 
 CREDAI national chairman Getamber Anand told TOI: “Fifteen states, including UP, are still not RERA-ready as they do not have a regulator in place. How and where are builders supposed to register when there is no regulator, no website for the process? Section 3(I) of the Act states that a builder should get a 90-day gateway period from the date of establishment of regulator to register themselves. Since there is no regulator, how are we supposed to register by July 31?”
 
 “From August 1, builders who are not registered with RERA will not be able to sell or advertise their projects, causing a big loss to the real estate industry in UP. Also, the process gives about 30-37 days’ time to get clearance from the authority and receive a registration number,” he said.
 
 “This means that a builder will not be able to sell units for the next 37 days, despite registering within deadline. This will also dent his business in a big way. Since most builders depend on inflow of money to take a project further, the construction cycle will stop causing loss to other allottees who have already invested in the project”, said another CREDAI member Rajesh Prajapati. 
 
 However, Singhal countered the complaints saying that RERA was notified in the state quite a while ago and he himself is the regulator for the time being.
 
 “Builders know they have to register by July 31 under RERA and the authority and the rules are in place. They were given enough time after notification, so these complaints do not stand. We have released a form, available at Awas Bandhu, for registering manually till the time the website is ready. Those who had to enrol should have already done by now. A couple of builders have already done this,” said Singhal.
 
 Moreover, he informed that the government is also set to launch the website well ahead of the July 31 deadline to give enough time to builders to register. “We will hold briefing sessions with them. Had there been fear of major loss, they would have filled the manual forms by now,” added Singhal.
