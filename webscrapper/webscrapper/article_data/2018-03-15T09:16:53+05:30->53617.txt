PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will construct a grade separator at   to ensure faster travel to   from Chinchwad, Vijay  , spokesperson of PCMC’s BRT cell, said.

 Dange Chowk is located in   at the junction of   and Chinchwad-Hinjewadi Road.
 
 Sangvi-Kiwale BRT Road is 42 metre wide having BRT corridor at the centre while Chinchwad-Hinjewadi Road is 30 meter wide. The civic body had constructed two parallel flyovers at the chowk on Sangvi-Kiwale BRT Road for vehicles to cross the chowk without stopping at traffic signal.
 
 Explaining the reason for the proposal to construct a grade separator, Bhojane said, “Vehicular traffic on Chinchwad- Bhumkar Chowk- Hinjewadi Road has been increasing over the years. There is traffic snarl on both sides of the chowk during morning and evening. A large number of vehicles cross the chowk either to go to Chinchwad or Wakad and beyond. So, we have taken a decision to construct a grade separator to enable the vehicles cross the chowk safely without stopping at traffic signal.”
 
 “There will be one lane each of 7.5-width for vehicles to go in one direction. Construction of the grade separator will significantly reduce traffic congestion at this busy chowk,” he said.
 
 “The height of the grade separator will be 5.5 metre to allow heavy vehicles to pass through the grade separator without any problem,” said Bhojane.
 
 “Chinchwad BJP MLA Laxman Jagtap has said that work must be undertaken in such a way that vehicular traffic on the service road is not affected. We will invite bids for the grade separator project in around six months. This project is included in the annual budget of 2018-19,” said Bhojane.
 
 He said that civic office bearers have suggested that not only grade separator but also the entire chowk be concreted.
