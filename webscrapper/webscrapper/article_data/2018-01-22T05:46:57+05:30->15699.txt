CHANDIGARH: The   court on Sunday ordered two-day police   for the accused student, who had shot dead his principal, while remanding his father in judicial custody. Both accused who were arrested on Saturday were produced before the duty magistrate.

 Amid heavy security arrangements, cops produced the accused student and his money lender father in court. Interestingly, cops chose to ask for   remand only of the boy. Yamunanagar city police station SHO, who is also an investigating officer, said that the student’s remand had been taken to ascertain if more boys accompanied him from home to school or in school. “Besides this, we have recovered case properties like books, answersheets, etc. and he has to be questioned as to how he had managed to get the revolver,” said inspector Om Parkash.
 
 The SHO refused to share any information related to student and his father and the confessions made by the father, saying that, “This is a matter of investigation.” Meanwhile, Yamunanagar SP   remained inaccessible.
