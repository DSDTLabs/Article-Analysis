CHENNAI: In a second gruesome crime of its kind in less than two weeks, an unknown assailant sexually assaulted and murdered a three-year-old girl near Thiruvottiyur on Saturday.

 The suspect dumped the child’s body in a garbage yard, police said on Sunday.
 
 On February 7, a man from an apartment complex in Moulivakkam sexually assaulted and murdered his seven-year-old neighbour.
 
 Quoting the girl’s parents, investigators in Thiruvottiyur case said the girl’s mother was ill and asleep at home and her father away at work when a neighbour took her away as she was playing with her five-year-old brother on Saturday evening.
 
 “The mother woke up at 3pm on Saturday,” an investigating officer said. “She went looking for the girl and informed her husband that their daughter was missing. The father lodged a police complaint.”
 
 Municipal workers discovered the girl’s body at a dump yard in Thiruvottiyur.
 
 “The assailant had gagged the child,” the officer said.
 
 Police sent the body for autopsy to Stanley Medical College and Hospital.
 
 Preliminary investigation indicated that the killer had sexually assaulted the child. Police are questioning a neighbour who the child’s parents suspect is the offender.
