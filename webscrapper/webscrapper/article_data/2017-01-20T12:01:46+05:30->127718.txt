KADAPA: Tummalapalle village in Kadapa district hosts more uranium reserves than believed. Researchers have now found uranium reserves buried at 1,000 metres in the earth at Tummalapalle and surrounding areas. Earlier, uranium reserves were found only up to a depth of about 250 metres. The finding could mean that the Tummalapalle uranium mine may last beyond 2050. The present reserves are expected to last between 20 and 30 years depending on the quantum of uranium oxide ore excavated per year. 

 Exploration studies have revealed 'down-dip' or downwards continuity or uranium mineralization up to one km vertical depth. This is expected to add large uranium oxide tonnage in the future. The finding was discussed at the recent meeting of the   ( ) held at  .
 
 This type of deposit is classified as "carbonate-hosted" uranium. The Uranium Corporation of India Limited ( ), which is manning the Tummalapalle uranium plant, may find it difficult to extract this uranium oxide reserve from such depths with the available technology. Uranium mineralization stretches to 160 km in and around Tummalapalle. 
 
 The Hyderabad-based   (AMD) has already established uranium oxide reserves of more than one lakh tonnes. The total reserves went up from just 14,300 tonnes of uranium oxide in 2000 to 85,000 tonnes by 2013-14. Now it is more than one lakh tonnes. The carbonate-hosted uranium will further add to the reserves, according to the proceedings of the GSI meeting.
 
 Researchers from Hyderabad estimated that the carbonate-hosted reserves were formed 1900-2000 million years ago.
