PUNE: As the   in   prepares to host seven Indian Premier League matches, the   has decided to appoint former national selector and   coach   to look after the preparation of wickets.

 Pune had hosted its first-ever Test match in February, but the rank turner and inept batting by Indians at Gahunje saw the match wrapping up in three days. The wicket was rated 'poor' by match referee  .
 
 According to MCA, Bhave is called to supervise the wicket preparation along with   curator Pandurang Salganocar. 
 
 Salgaoncar, who was the MCA curator for the Pune Test, was made a scapegoat by the BCCI for preparing a wicket that didn't match international standards. He later reportedly said he was asked by   to prepare a rank turner.
 
 MCA secretary   however said Bhave's appointment has nothing to do with the Test match debacle.
 
 "Surendra Bhave has prepared a few wickets for MCA in the past, including the one at Nehru Stadium for the India vs Sri Lanka ODI in 2005. The wicket was praised by many, including Sri Lanka skipper  . Bhave has a lot of experience in this field, hence the MCA managing committee decided to bring him on board," Bagwan said.
 
 When asked whether Salgaoncar would still have a say in the preparation of wicket, he said, "He will be there with Bhave. Since there are seven games to be held here, there will be a lot of work and at this age, it won't be easy for Salgaoncar sir to handle it alone. Bhave would be there to help him out."
 
 When probed if there was any pressure from the BCCI on changing the curator, Bagwan replied in negative. "Not at all. This was completely our call to have Bhave and Salgaoncar together," he said.
 
 Though on Sunday, both Salgaoncar and Bhave were seen at the Gahunje ground, it is believed the latter is incharge of the ground at the moment.
