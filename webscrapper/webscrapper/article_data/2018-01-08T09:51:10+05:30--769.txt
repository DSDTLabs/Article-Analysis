PUDUCHERRY/VILLUPURAM:: A three-member team from the income tax department searched the farmhouse of R K Nagar independent MLA and dissident AIADMK leader T T V Dhinakaran near   in   district on Sunday. 

 Police said the team from Chennai reached the farmhouse around 10am and searched the basement, which was sealed during the previous search in November last year.
 
 An income tax official from Puducherry joined the search team around noon. He left the farmhouse after an hour. Sources said the income tax sleuths could not search the basement of the farmhouse in November after prohibitory orders from competent authorities. The team sealed the basement after searching the other portions of the farmhouse. 
 
 The IT department succeeded in getting the prohibitory orders lifted following which the team visited the farmhouse on Sunday. The team opened the sealed basement and made an elaborate search.
 
 Dhinakaran used to frequently visit the farmhouse to hold discussions with his loyalists. His visits to the farmhouse were more frequent after he was removed from the party by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa.
 
 IT sources said this was not a new search but a continuation of the previous searches in November. As per the IT Act, the officials can visit or search again any premises as and when required with a prior warrant. 
 
 The IT sleuths recently searched Midas Distilleries at Padappai near Tambaram, Jayalalithaaâ€™s   residence and   office after sealing some portions of the properties. The IT department in November last year searched close to 200 properties of sacked AIADMK leader V K   and her relatives including Dhinakaran in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Telangana and Karnataka.
