HYDERABAD: Students appearing for the   in 2017-18 will now not only have to write their board exams but also study the entire syllabus. This, courtesy the   issued by the   (CBSE) on January 31. The new format makes it mandatory for students to score a minimum 33%, in both theory and internal assessment, to pass.

 Telangana has 122  , of which nearly 80% are based out of Hyderabad. Nearly 10,000 students from the city appear for their Class 10 exams every year.
 
 While admitting that the remodelled structure will bring in an increased sense of seriousness among students, principals feel that it is also likely to build pressure on them.
 
 “Studying the entire syllabus is tough and will put students under a lot of additional pressure. Even in courses like engineering, only six months' syllabus is considered for assessment,“ said M Varalakshmi, principal, Jubilee Hills Public School. The institution is planning to write to the CBSE chairman recommending that students be assessed on six month syllabus instead.
 
 While in the current format, the board exam and   is divided in a 60:40 ratio, the new structure will change this to 80:20. Students will be tested for the entire syllabus in the theory papers. Apart from that, schools have to conduct three periodic written tests for each subject, instead of the four formative assessments, and the average of the best two tests will be considered for the final marks submission.
 
 “As the weightage of one exam has increased, it is likely to affect the performance of children in the subjects they are not inclined to. Having said that, at that age, students need to be abreast of all subjects and the new structure will make them work equally hard on each of them. Students with alternate interests in sports and other cocurricular activities will be affected adversely ,“ said Iffat Ibrahim, principal of Chirec International School.
