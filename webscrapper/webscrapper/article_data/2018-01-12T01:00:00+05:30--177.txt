Chocolate lovers, here’s your prayer answered. Deepali Bawiskar, a Model Colony resident melds the beauty of sinful chocolate with the goodness of  . “Chocolate goodies needn’t just be restricted to Christmas or Ganesh Chaturthi. This version is an infusion of til-gul in dark chocolate and believe me, it tastes better when it’s dark chocolate than the milk variant!”
 
 
 
 If sweets aren’t your thing, this savoury delight by Mhatre Bridge-based homemaker Sanmati Mokal is the perfect fix. “Cooking is really an art, and experimentation is key. That’s where the idea for a savoury   dish came from,” says Sanmati. Her kachoris are stuffed with grated coconut, raisins and til.
 
 
 
 Sanmati treated us to another savoury special — Parathas with a stuffing of til, red chilli powder, garlic and dry coconut. She tells us that the dish also makes for a filling winter fix.
 
 
 
 Another wonder from Khushboo’s kitchen, these parathas contain a filling of caramelised jaggery. Kneading the dough to perfection, she makes the parathas in a generous amount of ghee, till the colour turns to a golden brown. This is quite the sugar-rush fix, we believe!
 
 
 
 Shukrawar Peth-based Khushboo Agarwal believes that the best thing passed down to her are her grandparents’ recipes. Recalling Sankranti memories from her childhood, she says, “I used to hide khoya-til laddus so that I didn’t have to share them with guests.” Be that as it may, Khushboo relives those days be preparing her favourite laddus to date. The balls of khoya, sugar, and til with a dash of cardamom powder, are yum!
