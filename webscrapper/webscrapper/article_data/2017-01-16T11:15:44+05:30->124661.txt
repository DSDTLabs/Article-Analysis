GUWAHATI: Fanfare and feasting marked Bhogali or   over the weekend. 

 On Friday or 'uruka', the eve of the festival, people took part in community feasts with gusto. Magh Bihu marks the end of the harvest season and is traditionally considered to be the time when granaries are full. 
 
 "It's great to be home during Bihu. It's an opportunity to meet family and friends. I always make it a point to be home this time of the year," Bangalore-based engineer   said from his home in Sivasagar.
 
 On Friday, men, women and children sang songs of joy as they marched towards ponds and lakes for community fishing.
 
 "We have been doing this (community fishing) for generations. It's great fun," said local   who dipped his net in the Goroimari Beel, some 35km from here.
 
 Residents of Hajo took part in a rally from Powa Mecca to Monikut Hill. The rally, organized by the All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) every year, symbolizes harmony.
 
 "Leaders from different faiths participated in the rally," said Kamrup DC Vinod Seshan. The Aasu has been organizing the rally since 1992 to promote communal harmony. 
 
 "The heads of the Haigriva Madhava temple and the Powa Mecca joined the rally as well," said Aasu president Dipanka Nath.
