Nagpur: Looking at her gentle smile and sparkle in the eyes, it is hard to gauge what Bhakti Ghatol, a Bachelor of Arts (BA) student from LAD College, has gone through to achieve success. The visually impaired student, who stood first among disabled and was overall 9th topper in BA course, won four medals, including three gold and one silver, at the 105th convocation of Nagpur University on Saturday. Accompanied by her parents Sushma and Dhananjay Ghatol, Bhakti thanked her teachers Soma Banerjee and Avinash Khare as well as writer Aditi Patwardhan, a BA student of Hislop College. Her mother is a housewife while father is officer with National Insurance Company. Her elder sister lives in Pune. Bhakti has battled three cancers. An eye cancer hit her when she was just six-month-old. Though she was cured, the cancer reoccurred when she was 5-year-old and took her eyesight. She was diagnosed with cancer of nose soon after her BA final exam in 2017. “The third time I was prepared for any eventuality and didn’t get hassled. I fought and won. Now, I want to be a counsellor,” she said. Bhakti, who has also been state topper in SSC and HSC among disabled students, started her schooling from Std I at Mount Carmel School but couldn’t focus on studies due to failing health.  She couldn’t attend school for two years but made a fresh beginning from Class III though that time she had lost her eyesight. Bhakti would used text-to-speech software to prepare for exams and complete assignments. Bhakti will now be pursuing MA Psychology from Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), one of the best institutes in the country. She would join the Mumbai-based institute in June. “Till then, I will have to improve my health, so I am learning yoga and following a strict diet. I am also learning chess. I like to read Dan Browne and psychology books,” she said.
