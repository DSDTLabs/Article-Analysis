NAGPUR: Photography which has been impacted by technology advances and the fast-paced   has brought in an influx of amateur photographers to the fold, feels lifestyle   Amogh Thakur.

 Thakur recently had two of his pictures picked up for publication in the 2017 edition of ‘The Best of Best Photographers’, which is an yearly book taken out by an international forum of photographers called ‘One Eyeland’. The book will be released later this month.
 
 Published first in 2007 the book is considered the pickiest of all as it filters thousands of photographs contributed by world photographers and selects barely 3% for the publication of the 10% selected to be put up on its website.
 
 Terming photography as an extremely crowded field today, Thakur says that it’s becoming difficult to get work. Specializing in lifestyle and fashion photography, the photographer says that he has found a niche in the hair segment. “Today a photographer is also a stylist who has to research and develop styles for doing these fashion shoots,” says Thakur who works with a team of make-up artists, hair stylists and   for his shoots.
 
 “Now we have to offer a one stop solutions to our clients which includes concept, design, styling and look of a book, calendar or whatever else is required,” he says.
