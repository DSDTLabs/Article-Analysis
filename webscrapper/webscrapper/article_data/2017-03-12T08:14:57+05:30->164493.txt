PUNE: The divisional commissioner has rejected a plea of five members of the   (RPI-A) to be recognised as   corporators. As a result, there will be no RPI member in the   ( ). 

 The divisional commissioner stated that since RPI candidates had contested the civic elections on Bharatiya Janata Party’s lotus symbol, they were   members and cannot register as a separate group. 
 
 During the recent civic elections, the BJP had asked the RPI candidates to contest on BJP tickets. 
 
 RPI’s national president Ramdas Athavale had expelled all candidates, who contested the polls on the BJP ticket.
 
 However, five corporators, who belong to the RPI but were elected on a BJP symbol approached the Pune divisional commissioner claiming that they belong to the RPI and must get recognition as a separate party in the PMC.
 
 The divisional commissioner’s office informed RPI corporators that their request has been rejected on technical ground and they will have to   BJP in the corporation. 
 
 The RPI leaders refused to comment on the issue saying that they will soon consult party president Athavale as well as BJP leaders in the state.
