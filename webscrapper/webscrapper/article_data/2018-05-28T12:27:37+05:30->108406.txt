THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The CPM-dominated   has created a new cosy post for public works minister G Sudhakaran’s wife Dr Jubilee Navaprabha, who retired as the vice-principal of Alappuzha SD College recently. She has been posted director of a group of self-financing institutions under the university.

 
 The university runs as many as 47 self-financing institutions, including 10 teacher education centres, an engineering college, seven management institutes and 29 university institutes of technology.
 
 People with core competency in the respective field are considered eligible to lead these institutions and heads of the respective departments were so far functioning as their directors too.
 
 The appointment order issued by the university on May 21, 2018, said the   was selected on the basis of an interview conducted by the university and the appointment is for a year on contract basis at a consolidated pay of Rs 35,000/month.
 
 No financial burden earlier
 
 Earlier, there was no additional financial burden either as the department heads were already there on university rolls.
 
 “...Dr Jubilee Navaprabha, Cliff house compound Nandancode-695003, is hereby informed that you are selected for engagement as director on contract basis at the directorate of management technology and teacher education, senate house campus, Palayam,” the appointment order said.
 
 Critics said the new post had been reserved for those who retired as principal/ vice-principal or department heads and this itself was manipulative as viceprincipal was not a post sanctioned by the university but created at the college level for administrative purposes.
