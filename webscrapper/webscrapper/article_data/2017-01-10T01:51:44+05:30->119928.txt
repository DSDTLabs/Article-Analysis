GURGAON: Even after Haryana State Pollution Control Board ( ) sent a notice to stop construction of a   in  , 45 km from Delhi’s Asola Sanctuary, the construction work has again started.

 The notice was sent by HSPCB on December 14, two days after TOI had reported the violation in its report “200 trees felled as   resumes”. 
 
 However, this correspondent found on Monday that the construction of a wall of the farmhouse has restarted. The farmhouse owner has already built a 500-ft-long and 2-ft-high boundary wall and he is now raising it.
 
 As the area falls under the Aravali Notification, no construction is allowed there as per law. Under sections 3(1) and 3(2)(v) of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 and rule 5(3)(d) of the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, ‘cutting of trees’ and ‘construction of any clusters of dwelling units, farms houses, sheds, community centres, information centres and any other activity connected with such construction (including roads a part of any infrastructure relating thereto) construction’ is prohibited in the area.
 
 “We had sent the notice last month. I will get the area inspected again and take action as per law. The major problem here is that the name of the farmhouse owner is not clear as per the revenue records. I will definitely coordinate with other departments to get as much details as possible,” said Kuldeep Singh, regional officer, HSPCB, said.
