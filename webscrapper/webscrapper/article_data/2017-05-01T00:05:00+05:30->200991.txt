Pune: Three persons, including the director of a private firm, were booked on Saturday for allegedly duping six people of Rs 1 crore on the promise of giving good returns on their investments.

 The incident occurred between May 2011 and December 2016. A 53-year-old woman resident of Paud Road has lodged a complaint with the Kothrud police in this regard.
 
 The suspects have been booked under sections 420 ( ) and 406 (criminal breach of trust) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors Act.
 
 As per the complaint, the director of the firm approached her and offered 16% interest on her investments in the firm. “Believing him, she invested Rs 40 lakh while her husband invested Rs 10 lakh. Five other people invested Rs 50 lakh in the firm,” the police said.
 
 The police said the suspect had given undertakings to all the investors and also gave post-dated cheques to them. “When the suspect did not return the interest amount, the complainant and others deposited the cheques in the bank. However, the cheques were returned on account of insufficient balance,” the police said, adding that this is the time when the complainant approached the Kothrud police and lodged the complaint.
 
 Senior inspector Raghunath Phuge is investigating the case.
