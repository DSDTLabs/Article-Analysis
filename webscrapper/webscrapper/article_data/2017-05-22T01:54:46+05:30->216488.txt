AHMEDABAD: For the   (AfDB) Annual Meetings — to be held at   from May 22 to 26 —   have rolled out the security arrangements that were in place for the Vibrant Gujarat Global Investors’ Summit 2017. 

 The state police have retained a number of security drills from the Vibrant Summit, including those relating to VVIP movement, Ahmedabad to Gandhinagar route inspection, and access control.
 
 On Sunday, Pradipsinh Jadeja, MoS (home); Geetha Johri, in-charge state DGP; Sanjeev Kumar, the secretary of finance department; and other senior IAS and IPS officers reviewed security arrangements at Mahatma Mandir. 
 
 Jadeja said that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that delegates don’t face any problems. “It is a prestigious event for Gujarat and India,” he said. “So many dignitaries from Africa are participating in the event which will bring Gujarat in focus on the global stage. Over 3,000 police officers and personnel will be deployed.”
 
 Jadeja said that four separate teams — one each for the Raj Bhavan, traffic and parking arrangements, Mahatma Mandir, and anti-agitation — have been formed for the event. The entire route and venue have been covered with 300 CCTV cameras for which a control room has been set up.
 
 While registration of participants and discussions will start on May 22, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the meetings on May 23. Officials said that route diversions and access to the venue will be on the lines of VGGIS.
 
 Late on Sunday, Gandhinagar and Ahmedabad police conducted a dress rehearsal for convoy movement from airport and from major hotels where the dignitaries and participants are staying. Arrangements have also been made for security at hotels, said officials.
