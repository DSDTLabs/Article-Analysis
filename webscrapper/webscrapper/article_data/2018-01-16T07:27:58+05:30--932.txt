BENGALURU: New York-based investment fund   and Silicon Valley’s prominent accelerator Y Combinator have led a $20-million funding round in payments solutions player  , a statement from the company said on Monday. Early investor in the company,   also participated in the latest fundraise.

 TOI first reported in its December 19 edition that Razorpay was finalising a $20-million financing round from its existing investors Tiger Global, and YC’s $700-million Continuity Fund, with Apoletto Managers — run by partners at Russian billionaire Yuri Milner’s DST Global, coming in as a new investor.
 
 The company statement, however, did not mention Apoletto since the investment vehicle does not make its early-stage bets public.
 
 Razorpay’s fundraise comes at a time when global names like Stripe and   have announced their India plans for a larger play in the local payments market. The company will invest the fresh funds to push new products that it launched in September last year — including facilities like recurring payments, automation of bank transfers like NEFT, and invoice management as part of its new strategy under Razorpay 2.0.
 
 “We are looking to expand our team and hire heads for new business verticals. About 50% of new hires will be in technology and product teams, while the rest would be for business roles,” said Harshil Mathur, co-founder & CEO, Razorpay. At present it has about 130 people and it could hire over 70 people during this year. Mathur said the company, as part of new strategy, plans to generate at least 30% of company’s revenue from these launches.
 
 The company said it aims to on-board new merchants and increase the base to about 2 lakh by the end of 2018.
