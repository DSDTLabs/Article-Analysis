MADURAI: Residents of the   have been left in the lurch as the underground work taken up by the   has been lying incomplete for over four months now. They have been finding it very difficult to use these narrow but thickly populated streets, which are around the heart of the   city.

 Thirumalai Naicker Mahal, a heritage structure, is visited by hundreds of tourists on a daily basis. Many streets around this palace are said to have been formed during the rule of Thirumalai Naicker and are narrow streets, which still continue to have houses.
 
 There are eight mahal streets, known by their numbers with the pre-fix ‘mahal’. Sometime ago, they got a facelift and were paved with paver blocks, making them smooth and beautiful. But four months ago, the paver blocks were removed to make way for the underground drainage system.
 
 K R Tulasiram of 6th street says that, it has become very difficult after the UGD work was taken up. “It is sad to see the paver blocks removed and left careless on the roads. With many of them getting broken, some streets have become so narrow that vehicles cannot enter,” she said.
 
  The residents are forced to use a road that is only one or two feet wide now.   collectors, who cannot bring their vehicles here, have asked the residents to bring their garbage and deposit at the entrance. But now many residents have started dumping the waste into the piled paver blocks, are adding to the woes.
 
 Auto rickshaws refuse to ply down these roads and elderly persons have to walk a long stretch to reach their homes. “Thank god we have not had any emergencies, but it is scary to think of an emergency situation in near future,” said S   a resident. Of these streets, the third and eighth streets are extremely narrow making it very difficult for the people to use them. Corporation sources said that the work is pending because the contractor had deserted the work due to some issues. “We will sort it out at the earliest and complete it,” they said.
