GURUGRAM: The forest department has picked four Aravali   — Sakatpur, Raisina, Gairatpur Bas and Roj Ka Gujjar — to carry out drone mapping and check  . 

 “We want to kick-start drone mapping from the villages of Sakatpur, Raisina, Gairatpur Bas and Roj Ka Gujjar. This will make it easier for us to analyse how much area has been encroached upon. The mapping will take about a month, after which we’ll take another 10-20 days to analyse the data,” said  , chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Gurugram.
 
 The four villages have been selected as these have massive forest cover which is rich in wildlife. According to sources, the department is hopeful that the mapping will eventually help bring down man-animal conflicts in these villages.
 
 Talking about the benefits of drone images, Kumar said, “As drone images can be zoomed in, any violation — encroachment or tree cutting — can be tracked easily. These visuals can also be used as evidence.”
 
 On May 24, forest minister   formally launched the two   — a basic drone and an industrial one — being used by the forest department. 
 
 While the basic drone can carry out surveys, the industrial drone can be embedded with various sensors, including thermal sensor, to spot any crime against wildlife or non-forest activity in real time. This drone is fitted with an optical sensor of 43 megapixels and a camera. It will fly at a height of 70ft at a speed of over 60km per hour. 
 
 The drones have been introduced after green activists raised concern over rising environmental violations in the  .
