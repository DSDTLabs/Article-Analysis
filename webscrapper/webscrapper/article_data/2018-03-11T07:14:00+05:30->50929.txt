 Lal has been booked under sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC and various sections of the IMC Act. He was produced in court and was sent in judicial custody on Saturday.
 
  Sources said the raid was conducted following a tip off that someone was running a clinic illegally and prescribing medicines without the required qualification.

 “He (Lal) doesn’t have a medical degree or licence to prescribe or sell drugs. And it is a crime to put others’ life at risk. We are investigating how long he had been involved in this trade and if any patient had suffered due to his diagnosis and prescription,” said Gahlain.
