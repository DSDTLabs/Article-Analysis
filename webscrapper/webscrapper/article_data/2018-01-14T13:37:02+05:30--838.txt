BENGALURU: Industries minister R V Deshpande’s suggestion to   to make Bengaluru the country’s second capital has been lauded by a few corporate bigwigs in the city.

 
  chairperson Kiran Mazumdar Shaw tweeted: “Bengaluru is already the science capital, startup capital and technology capital of the country. It is the best choice for a second capital.” Shaw stated that Karnataka has created Belagavi as its second capital.
 
  
  
 
 Shaw’s endorsement of Deshpande’s plea has generated ample buzz on social media platforms. Joining her,   chairman Mohandas Pai tagged   in his tweet and appealed: “PM Sir, please consider Bengaluru the second capital for India. It is India’s only global city, science city, IT city, biotech city and fashion city. Sir, we will make India proud.”
 
 Many from the corporate world favour Bengaluru as the second capital, but with a rider: The city’s infrastructure should be drastically improved. One of the tweets listed out the problems plaguing Bengaluru: “Becoming a better place to live is more important than second capital.” The city’s woes include shortage of water supply, traffic gridlocks, deteriorating air quality, inundation of low-lying areas during monsoon and official apathy towards civic problems. Some Twitterati also feared that seeking secondcapital status without being ready for it would only end up turning Bengaluru into an international slum.
 
 The issue was at the centre of discussions on Saturday. A   leader said: “Deshpande’s proposal is good but the timing could be wrong. We have won 12 of the 28 assembly constituencies in Bengaluru and the BBMP council is dominated by us, but citizens have got no respite from potholed roads and slow traffic. The move may lead to anti-incumbency instead of helping us score brownie points.”
 
 The BJP also raised a few questions. “By lobbing the ball into the PM’s court, is the Siddaramaiah government trying to pit Bengalureans against the BJP,” a former minister asked.
