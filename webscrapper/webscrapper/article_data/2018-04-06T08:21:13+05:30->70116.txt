IMPHAL: Manipur erupted in pride on Thursday over the gold medal won by S   on Thursday. Celebrations broke out at Nongpok Kakching village in   East district, Mirabai’s hometown, with friends and supporters coming together to perform the ‘Thabal Chongba’ dance, share sweets and smear vermilion on each other.

 
 
 
 The youngest among six siblings, Mirabai would go to collect firewood from a nearby hill with her older brother Saikhom Sanatomba Meitei, reports PTI.
 
 “One day I could not lift the bundle of firewoods but Mira easily lifted it and took it our home, about two kilometres away. She was about 12-year-old then,” Sanatomba said.
 
 
 
 It was the earliest memory of Mirabai that Sanatomba could recall on a day the world champion weightlifter lived up to the reputation on Thursday. In his congratulatory message, chief minister   hailed Mirabai as a true Manipuri Ningol (woman), saying she has done the state and country proud. “We are proud of you for making India proud,” he tweeted. He also expressed hope that the champion weightlifter will win many more laurels in future.
 
 
  
 
 Echoing Biren, state youth affairs and sports minister Letpao Haokip said: “She has created history not only for Manipur but also for our country India and the entire Commonwealth Games fraternity. I congratulate her on bringing laurels for our country and the state in particular and wish her success in all her future endeavours,” said the sports minister in a press release.
 
 “We are so happy to hear of Mirabai’s golden feat. She has broken the Commonwealth Games record. We are really proud of her glory and her victory will give new strength to the young athletes of the state,” said W Binoy, a sports lover. “We are confident that athletes of our state, the mini-powerhouse of India, will always shine at all world championships in future,” added Binoy, an Imphal resident.
