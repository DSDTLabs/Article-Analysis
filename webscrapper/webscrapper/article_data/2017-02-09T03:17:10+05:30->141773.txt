NEW DLEHI: A 30-year-old man was   by three teenagers after they robbed him while he was returning home from work. 

 The incident was reported in west Delhi’s Janakpuri late on Monday. Police said the man was carrying Rs 800 in his wallet to buy   for his ailing son.
 
 The victim, identified as Danish, worked at a garment shop in Noida and was returning home around midnight. Police said that he got down from a bus at Dabri flyover from where he was walking towards his house in Mohan Garden. “While I was walking, two youths pushed me. Before I could get up, the teenagers pulled out the wallet from my pocket,” said Danish. 
 
 He said that he pleaded with the   to let him keep the cash as it was all he had. They took the cash out of the wallet and returned the wallet to him, saying he could sell it if he urgently needed money.
 
 “My son has been ill for a while and his medicines cost Rs 750. I had withdrawn cash to buy his medicines the next day. The robbers took it as a joke. They then snatched my phone from my hand, gave the SIM card to me, and pushed me back again,” he added. 
 
 Police said that when Danish tried to resist, they stabbed him with a knife in the back and threw him in a corner, before fleeing the spot. Police officers sub-inspector Yadav, head constable Sanej and assistant sub-inspector Vijender, patrolling the area, noticed the man and took him to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital where he was declared critical.
