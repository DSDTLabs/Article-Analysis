LUCKNOW: Early detection of   will help lessen the economic burden of the disease in state. Early detection would require change in strategy from passive to active detection. 

 Before   government announced a plan to eradicate TB by 2025, patients were identified only when they walked into a health facility. But now, with adoption of active case finding (ACF), health workers are going door to door to screen TB patients. 
 
 In the three ACF rounds in the state till now, over 1.25 crore patients were screened, 7,303 were diagnosed with TB and put on medication.
 
 "What is remarkable about the exercise is that these patients have been identified about 4-6 months before symptoms appear. This has a huge socio-economic implication," said GS  , special secretary health on the eve of World TB Day.
 
 Explaining the fallout of early detection of TB cases, senior supervisor,   said, "A confimed TB patient passes on infection to at least 10-15 persons. Early detection curbs this transmission. Besides, the patient is saved from the risk of developing resistant form."
 
 On the economic side, those diagnosed with TB saved the money they would have spent in getting diagnosis. "Our internal estimates show that a person spends about Rs 2,000 per month before TB gets confirmed. Also, when diagosed early, the loss of productivity is also curtailed," said Mitra. 
 
 An sample study, considering a contractual computer operator being diagnosed TB before signs like cough and loss of weight, energy appeared, showed initial saving of Rs 12,000. Considering that he earns Rs 4,045 per month (calculated from UP's per capita income), the saving for six months comes to 24,270. The total savings due to early diagnosis comes to Rs 36,000.
