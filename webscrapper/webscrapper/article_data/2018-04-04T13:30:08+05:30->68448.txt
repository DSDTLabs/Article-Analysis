REIS MAGOS: An amount of Rs1.72 crore has been sanctioned for   work for residents of PDA colony, Vidhya Enclave, Green Valley, Gautam Estate and other colonies at Alto-Betim, minister of housing Jayesh   said.

  The work has been taken up by the PWD at an estimated cost of Rs 72 lakh. Residents of Vidhya Enclave said that this was a long-pending demand. Reis Magos deputy sarpanch Siya Nagvekar, in whose ward the road work has been taken up, told reporters that this demand had been pending for over five years and that people were having a tough time as the road had been totally washed away.
 
 Locals also brought the problem of frequent electricity fluctuations to the notice of the MLA. Commenting that this was a problem affecting the entire constituency, Salgaonkar attribute it to overloading as most people use the air conditioners during the summer season. “A new 33 KVA substation is under process at  . It will have a direct line from the Thivim sub-station. Once this is complete, this problem of power fluctuations will be resolved” Jayesh told reporters.
 
 On the widening of Chogm road, Salgaonkar said, “The file for the proposed widening work will be tendered soon. This road was not touched since it was constructed,” he said.
