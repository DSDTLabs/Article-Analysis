COIMBATORE: Many residents, including children and their parents, eagerly watched the trifecta - blue moon, super moon and   – at Sreevats Global Village and VOC Park where special arrangements were made to watch the lunar eclipse through telescopes and binoculars. 

 A special hang out was arranged by   of   Education at Sreevatsa Global Village for the science feat where more than 150 residents gathered.   Science   had set up telescopes at VOC Park. 
 
 R Rameshan, vice president of the Tamil Nadu Science Forum, said though it can be seen with naked eyes we wanted the residents to get a better view. “We discussed various aspects of the eclipse and tried to make it interesting for the people,” said Rameshan.
 
 “The second full moon that happens mostly in months with 31 days is called blue moon. On the other hand, the moon was much closer to the earth and was 14% bigger than usual. This is super moon. Blood moon is when the earth’s shadow falls on the moon and the sun’s light still manages to shine onto the moon making it look red in colour,” said Rameshan. Though the eclipse began at 4.21pm, residents in Coimbatore were able to see it only after 6.30pm. It went on till 7.37pm but throughout India it was visible till 8.47pm.
 
 Various residents trekked mountains and travelled to hillocks to get a better view. “We are a group of photographers and we wanted to get good photographs of the eclipse as it was a rare phenomenon. Luckily, the skies were clear and we were happy that we got good shots,” said Rajesh M, a city-based photographer.
