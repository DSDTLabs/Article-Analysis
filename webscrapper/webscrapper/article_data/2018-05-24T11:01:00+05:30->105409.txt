In the latest episode of  ,   returns to the Gokuldham society without filing a police complaint. In the jeep, he tells   and Sodhi that they would convince   to listen to the astrologer (Nattu Kaka) Baba Tunn and this shall help them pass time. 

 When the scooter would return at 3 pm, they'd park it behind the society's compound. They can then take Bhide outside and pretend to look for it according to 'baba's' instructions. Eventually they will go where it is kept and show it to Bhide. This will solve their problem. 
 
 While Sodhi feels the plan may work, Popat begs to differ. Mehta calls Jethalal and informs him that they must return to the society as soon as possible as Bhide is threatening to go to the police station himself. 
 
 Jethalal tells him his plan. Mehta counters it initially but then leaves it up to Jethalal to convince Bhide. Popat, Sodhi and Jetha return to the society, and go to Mehta's house to meet Bhide. As soon as they enter, everyone floods them with questions. Bhide asks them for a copy of the police complaint. 
 
 Jethalal tells Bhide that they didn't file a police complaint. This leaves everyone surprised. Iyer questions Jethalal and this makes the latter retort. Finally, Jethalal tells Bhide that he thought the police would take a lot of time to find his Sakharam. 
 
 Since he was in a fix, he called Daya's mother, who knows the solution to every problem. She asked him to consult a 'baba', who can find out lost things. He suggests they should call the 'baba' and seek his help to know where the scooter is and when they will find it. Bhide is not sure about Jetha's solution, but gives in as he wants his scooter back.
