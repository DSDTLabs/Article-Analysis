THRISSUR: The vigilance officials filed an FIR relating to the alleged land encroachment by actor   for the construction of the multiplex D Cinemaas at  , on Monday. The officials filed the FIR as per the directive of the inquiry commissioner and special judge A Haris. Earlier in the day, the judge had pulled up the vigilance officials for the delay in registering the FIR.

 
 The judge had directed the vigilance officials to register FIR against Dileep and the former district collector M  , and conduct a probe on the charges of land encroachment. The judge gave this order on March 15, after rejecting the quick verification report filed by the vigilance officials which absolved Dileep of the charges.
 
 The complaint was filed by social activist P D Joseph. Joseph filed another petition alleging that the vigilance officials were deliberately delaying the FIR against Dileep because of his influence.
 
 
 The vigilance officials clarified that they had received the court order directing the registration of FIR only after a couple of days of the court pronouncing the order, and they had to subsequently consult the additional legal adviser.
