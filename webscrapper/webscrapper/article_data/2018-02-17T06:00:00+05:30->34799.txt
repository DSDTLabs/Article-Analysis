Starring   and   in lead roles, Manjula Ghattamaneni’s debut directorial   features six songs composed by Radhan and penned by Anantha Sririam. The film charts the journey of Nithya and Suraj who run away together from their own wedding. But what happens when they fall in love with each other forms the crux of the story. 

 First on the album is Parichayamu Leda, featuring Sameera Bharadwaj’s vocals. The romantic song with a classical touch has beautiful lyrics and a soothing tune. The song picks up bit of a pace in terms of music a little way in, but still maintains the calming vibe. 
 
 Second on the album is Rey Idi Nee Jaga sung by Yazin Nizar and Ramya NSR. The laidback and beach-y song features okay lyrics, but good tune, vocals and music. Fun and carefree, this number’s one for the weekends. 
 Ra Ra Ilara by Haricharan is a melodic and sweet romantic number that is easy on the ears. With beautiful lyrics, vocals and music, this one’s almost reminiscent of retro melodies. Naresh Iyer’s Oh   switches things up a bit with fun and music. The lyrics however are okay, failing to make much of an impression. 
 
 Fifth on the album is  , featuring Srinivas Raghunathan’s vocals. A retro-style dance number, the song has good music and lyrics. This foot-tapping number seems to be the most memorable one on the album so far, until it switches things up at the end and turns into a romantic melody, sounding like two separate songs. 
 
 Gadichina Prathi Rojuni, the last song on the album, features Swetha Mohan and is a number that seems from another era. Despite the effective lyrics and music, the tune makes it sound just okay. 
 All in all, the album of Manasuku Nachindi is good for a one-time listen with Parichayamu Leda, Ra Ra Ilara and Gadichina Prathi Rojuni standing out. Give this one a chance if you've got time to kill!
