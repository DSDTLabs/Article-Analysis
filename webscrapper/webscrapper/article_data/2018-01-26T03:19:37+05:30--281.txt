MUMBAI: A not-for-profit company formed by the   (IIT-B) to improve alumni relations, raise donations and assess internal needs, has raised questions from residents on campus and old students worldwide.

 The   (IITBDRF) has been set up in addition to two existing alumni bodies:   and Heritage Foundation which largely works with alumni in the US. Heading IITBDRF is Liza Boffen, who has managed alumni programs for universities abroad. This is Boffen's first stint in India and she is being paid Rs 1.16 crore, which is more than what the IITB director or any faculty gets.
 
 Interestingly, alumni donation is used to meet the expenses of this new initiative, which is ratified by the IITB board. However, there is a sense of disquiet among a section of alumni, who recently filed an RTI to know the reasons for forming a new body, its sources of funding, the names of its directors and why not a single alumnus was on the board.
 
 When TOI met IITB director Devang Khakhar, he said the institute needed a fund-raising body and the IITDRF came into existence based on a consulting agencyâ€™s report on how to make IITB financially sustainable.
