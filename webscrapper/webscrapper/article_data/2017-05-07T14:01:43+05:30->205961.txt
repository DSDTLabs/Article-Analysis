I was neither drunk, nor speeding,' said   in an official statement at a hurriedly called press con on Friday .He tried hard to come clean on the car crash that killed model-anchor  , but not many , especially Sonika's friends, seem to be buying his logic. Some of them told me that her parents, who didn't break down even once at the funeral, want to get to the bottom of it, no matter how grim it is.Only a few days back, a group of her friends apparently sped up their cars along the same lane at night to get a feel of what happened that night. The stretch has a big mall and one of Kolkata's busiest markets and not surprisingly, none could touch 120kmhr, which, rumours say , was the speed of Vikram's car that night. The actor himself has denied this and the fact is, Sonika was herself scared of speeding cars. The model's friends tell me that   had entered her life recently and the two would party on nights they had a relaxed schedule. Unlike her boyfriend   Bhattacherjee, Vikram didn't know her family and Sonika had introduced her to only a few chosen friends. There are a few missing links -where were the two between 2.15 am, when they left a nightclub, and 3.30 am, which is roughly when the accident took place? Who took them to the hospital that night? Why were Sonika's parents not informed right after the accident? Whose number did Vikram dial first? Why did Sonika refuse Shaheb's offer to drop her home that night? Till the questions are answered, Vikram may find it difficult to get back to work.
