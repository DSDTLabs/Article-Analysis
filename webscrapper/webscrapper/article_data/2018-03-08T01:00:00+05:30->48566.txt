This year is likely to witness the debut of two star daughters in Bollywood — late   and Boney Kapoor’s eldest born   and Saif Ali Khan-Amrita Singh’s beti, Sara Ali Khan. Buzz is also that Chunky Pandey’s daughter Ananya is gearing up to join showbiz. So, when BT met   recently, we asked him if his girls — Mahikaa and Myra — will end up following their dad’s footsteps into the industry. 

 The actor replied, “I think they will end up doing something creative. Myra is good at painting and I don’t know where she gets that from, considering the fact neither me nor my wife ( ) can sketch to save our lives. They both love music and dancing. I look at them and think, ‘Oh, my God, these kids are going to be actresses!’ In fact, Drama is one of Mahikaa’s majors. She likes theatre and participates in all her school plays. I am not going to force or push them, but if they need any help, I will be there. As parents, we can only guide them. Many newcomers who don’t come from the industry have father figures to guide them. My children have me at home. If my daughters want to join films, I will support them. I would send them to a film school or ask them to assist a director. They should go for dance and ballet training, do vocal exercises and hone their skills. It’s a tough industry and while it gives you a lot, it takes away a lot as well. One has to have a tremendous amount of inner strength. It’s not an easy place and now, it has become even more competitive.”
