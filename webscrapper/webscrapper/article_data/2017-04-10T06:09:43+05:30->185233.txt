GURUGRAM: Fear loomed over residents of Bandhwari following reports of pugmarks of   being found in the area and in Mangar on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.

 While a few villagers in Bandhwari expressed fear, residents of Mangar   said it was a routine affair for them. “We have been spotting pugmarks nearly every day. Earlier, these were of the leopard, now they are of the hyena. We’re living in fear. Many a time, wild animals have taken away our cattle. There is a need for the forest department to increase vigilance in the area, as we don’t want any man-animal conflict like Mandawar,” said Bandhwari resident Suresh Kumar.
 
 Mangar resident Uday Dev said, “We have got used to pugmarks and are happy wildlife is growing in the area. People do not   here. Villagers have been co-existing with wildlife for centuries.”
 
 Some cyclists too confirmed having seen the pugmarks. “We have been cycling on this stretch over weekends for the past 5-6 years. We have never noticed pugmarks so frequently. It seems wild animals are coming out in search of food and water,” said a member of a cycling group.
 
 The forest department claimed it has made arrangements for increasing availability of water in the forest. “We have two water holes in the area that are regularly filled. There is no scarcity of water in the forest. Sighting of pugmarks is a good sign. It indicates numbers of wild animals in the area, especially hyenas, is growing,” said Shyam Sunder, district forest officer (wildlife),  .
