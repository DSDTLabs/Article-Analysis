BENGALURU: Lending voice and giving it a clear political dimension, new   leader and Gujarat MLA   on Monday called upon Dalits to defeat the   in Karnataka, in retaliation to Union minister Ananthkumar Hegde’s statement, reportedly calling the Dalit community “dogs”.

 In a release, which he also tweeted, Mevani said: “I call upon Dalits and other oppressed communities to defeat the BJP that views Dalits as dogs, in the coming elections of Karnataka.”
 
 Mevani referred his call to defeat the BJP by citing the minister’s recent statement against Dalit activists who were staging a protest against his statements in Ballari district, by calling them “barking street dogs”. “This shows the Brahmanical and evil mindset of the Sangh Parivar, and its functionaries from top to bottom, which has no place for Dalits,” he said.
 
 He referred to the statement as a clearly painful assault on the dignity and selfrespect of the Dalits of the country. He has also said it is an offence under the Atrocities Act, so there should be an FIR against him and he must be arrested at the earliest.
 
 He wanted PM   to drop “the man who called Dalits dogs”, from his council of ministers and urged the President, “who himself is a Dalit and a supreme custodian of the Indian Constitution to consider the seriousness of the remarks and disqualify the minister from his   membership”.
