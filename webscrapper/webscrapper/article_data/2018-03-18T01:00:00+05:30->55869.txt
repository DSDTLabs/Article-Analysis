 will be seen in an unlikely dance number in Allu Arjun’s upcoming  , Naa Peru Surya. This will indeed be a special appearance as Elli clarifies it’s not an item song as is popularly believed. 

 The actress told BT, “I am a huge fan of Allu Arjun’s dancing and I was thrilled to be featured alongside him in the film. You won’t see him dance much in this song though. Another reason for me to do this number was the fact that it’s poetic, lyrical and gives a message about life that’s quite relatable to people across. It’s not an item song that caters to a certain audience. I had to work on my expressions as well.”
