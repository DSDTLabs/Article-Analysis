Vadodara: A police inspector drew the courtâ€™s ire on Thursday for repeatedly disobeying the order to appear in person in connection with the hearing on an attempt to murder case.

 V P Parmar, who was earlier police inspector at City police station, had investigated an attempt to murder case registered at the police station last year. After the case was committed for trial, Parmar was summoned by the court on July 19 but he did not turn up. 
 
 Later, the court issued a bailable warrant against him. Still, Parmar did not appear after which the court served the warrant to him through a nodal officer which again he disobeyed. The court, then, issued a non-bailable warrant against him but Parmar still refused to appear during the subsequent hearing.
 
 After repeated disobedience by Parmar, the court issued a contempt notice against him under section 350 of Criminal Procedure Code. On getting the notice, Parmar turned up on Thursday. The court asked Parmar the reason for not obeying its order but when he could not give a satisfactory reply, the court slapped a fine of Rs 100 on him.
 
 During the hearings of the case, Parmar had not even submitted any report to the court.
 
 Parmar, who is currently posted in license branch of city police, was serving as inspector of Bapod police station, after he was transferred from City police station, where he created quite a stir. In November last year, Parmar had arrested Sunil Panchal, a builder and BJP worker, for finding a stick from his car. Panchal had to spend time in lock-up even after MP Ranjan Bhatt and deputy mayor Yogesh Patel went there and made requests to not book Panchal.
 
 It was only after then assistant commissioner of police (Control) Pradeepsinh Jadeja intervened, Panchal was given bail and allowed to go.
