AHMEDABAD: Crime branch officials arrested two gunrunners,   alias Munna, resident of Chhota Udepur and Ravi Maurya of Dhar in Madhya Pradesh. Police have seized three pistols and 35 rounds of ammunition from the accused.

 Additional deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Rajdeepsinh Jhala, said they arrested both accused from Alirajpur Road near Chhota Udepur acting on a tip-off. 
 
 “During interrogation of the accused it came to light that about six months ago Munna had provided three pistols and cartridges to Shiva Mahalingam alias Aftab. Mahalingam was arrested by crime branch on May 1 for the murder of one Nasir Shaikh, a tea stall owner in Fatehwadi,” Jhala said.
 
 Crime branch officials said Munna is a history-sheeter. “In 1998, he was arrested for the murder of one Javed Pirzada in Chhota Udepur and was sentenced to life imprisonment,” an official said.
 
 He was lodged in Vadodara Central Jail and had jumped parole several times.
 
 “While in Vadodara jail, he met Mahalingam. They met often after Munna jumped parole in 2015,” the official said. Munna had also supplied firearms and ammunition to one Hasam Langha of Rapar in Kutch while lodged in Bhuj jail, through his friend Manjeet alias Raja Sardarji. “While Hasam was arrested in the case, Munna was absconding,” said the official.
