NASHIK: The   rural police are planning to install global positioning system (GPS) on their anti-dacoity squad (ADS) vans. This would help senior officials and the control room to know the location of the vans so that the van closest to a crime scene can be rushed to the spot.

 Spread over 15 talukas with Surgana, Peth and Trimbak on the west, Satana and   on the north,   and Yeola on the east and   and   on the south, the rural Nashik sees continuous traffic of people through national and state highways criss-crossing the district.
 
 On this backdrop, chances of robberies on highways cannot be ruled out. In April 2015, five dacoits posing as policemen had robbed a van of gold biscuits, worth Rs 16.28 crore near Nashik on the Mumbai-Agra highway. The van which belonged to a cargo transporter was on its way to a gold refinery in Dhule.
 
 The rural areas also witness cases of dacoities. So, the rural police have deployed 10 ADS vans, which are continuously on the move from 6pm to 5am to show their presence so that criminals are deterred from committing crimes and at the same time, the patrol party can rush to any spot during a call of distress.
 
 Senior officials said that they would soon be equipping the vans with GPS. It will help officials to direct the patrolling vans to incident spots, and also instruct the patrolling teams to move in areas where the visibility of police is less.
