A get-together to celebrate the 121st birthday of Netaji   was organized by Adheer Som, Kanak Rekha Chauhan, Arvind Sharma and Nitin recently. 
Adheer, the author of a book on   – who was assumed to be Netaji – shed some light on the different aspects of Netaji’s life.
 Making the celebrations memorable was the presence of the grand nieces of Subhash Chandra Bose, Tapti Ghosh and Jayanti Bose Rakshit. Overwhelmed by the warm welcome, Jayanti, who was accompanied by her husband Amiya Kumar Rakshit, said, "Thank you so much for this lovely evening." 
 Later, Jayanti, Amiya and Tapti were seen interacting with the guests. Sanvi, a young girl, turned the celebrations emotional as she sang the patriotic track Ae Mere Vatan Ke Logon. Later, a few other guests also sang patriotic songs.
