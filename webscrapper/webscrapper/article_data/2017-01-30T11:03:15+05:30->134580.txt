NAGPUR: Lack of proper bus bays for city buses at   is causing trouble for passengers. 

 The   (NMC) development project road department has failed to construct internal roads even though the transport department has erected five platforms.
 
 After a 10 year battle, the state government allowed the NMC to operate its buses from Mor Bhavan bus terminus in December last year. 
 
 Earlier, only three platforms were allotted to the NMC to operate city buses through Vansh Nimay Infraprojects Limited. Due to lack of place, the operator used  , especially the patch between Variety Square and  , for operating the buses.
 
 Five sheds have been erected but development project road department is yet to level the surface and tar the road that was dug up in front of the platforms in November last year .
 
 At any given point of time, about 20 city buses are parked haphazardly at Mor Bhavan due to lack of space. 
 
 Given the stiff competition among themselves, bus crew often indulge in one-upmanship to get ahead and park the vehicles haphazardly triggering quarrels. With buses parked side-by-side, vehicles behind them have a tough time exiting the terminus. Hapless commuters are often at the receiving end. During peak hours, the number of buses goes up sharply. 
 
 “The terminus is a picture of disorder. The NMC should set up a terminus for city buses at the Central Bus Stand,” said  , a resident of Kamptee who commutes in city buses.
 
 Official from NMC’s DP road department admitted the delay and stated that the platforms will be constructed and approach roads tarred soon.
