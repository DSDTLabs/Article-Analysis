HYDERABAD: Public representatives have raised concerns over the treatment of hawkers by traffic police, alleging cops are arbitrarily imposing penalties on these small traders for the minutest of reasons.

 According to   corporator  , several hawkers in the past few weeks have been fined an average of Rs 200. These traders survive as daily wage earners, the fine imposed leaves them with little or nothing at the end of the day .
 
 “There have been several cases in the past few days. These are poor people and need all the support that they can get. It is very difficult for them to make ends meet. Imposing challans on them will only worsen their financial situation,“ he said. Several of these worried hawkers have expressed their inability to pay these fines.
 
 Activists point out that Gre ater  's planned vendor zoning system and vendor cards could greatly improve the situation. They added that mild regulation could create win-win situations for both the hawkers and traders.
 
 “The corporation should go full swing with regulation and issuing of these cards. Once this happens, harassment by traffic police will stop and the traffic will move unhindered,“ said  , an activist.
 
 Commuters maintain that several hawkers occupy large portions of the carriageway in core   , causing traffic snarls. “The Charminar Shalibanda road is actually wide.The hawkers occupy at least two lanes. This leaves a narrow strip of the carriageway available for vehicles. Unless there is strict regulation, nothing will change. Traffic will continue to be difficult to manage.Those who will be most affected will be the commuters,“ said   , a resident of Noor Khan Bazaar.
