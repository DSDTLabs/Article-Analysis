BHOPAL: A day after TOI published a report about dalits being barred by   from participating in a Yajna, in Kolukhedi village of Berasia tehsil in Bhopal district, administration on Sunday rushed to review the situation.

 Officials including the local sub-divisional magistrate, tehsildar and police officials visited the village and talked to the local villagers. 
 
 SDM Berasia recorded statements of the affected villagers as well as families that are being accused of barring entry of dalits into the pandal. Later, the police officials led by the DSP Anushuchit Jati Kalyan (AJK) also went to the village and talked to the members of both sides and recorded their statements. 
 
 Even after the attempts by the officials, the dalits alleged that no compromise has been reached. “Still we are not being allowed to enter the   site. We are not allowed to access to yajna vedi,” alleges Mukesh Mongia, a villager. 
 
 Officials claimed the organisers have said it was a private function and initially when the yagna was planned no villager showed any interest. So only those organising it are given entry inside the yajna vedi premises.
 
 “We have recorded their statements and will send report to senior officials,” claimed an official. 
 
 The ‘Panch Kundaliya Shri Vishnu Mahayajna’ held near a temple in Kolukhedi in Berasia tehsil will end on May 16.
