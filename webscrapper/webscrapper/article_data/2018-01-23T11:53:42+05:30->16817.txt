LUCKNOW:   chief   will contest the 2019   elections from Kannauj parliamentary constituency. The former CM said the party patriarch  , who currently represents Azamgarh constituency, will contest the next election from Mainpuri. 

 The announcement came four months after the SP chief - amid a raging debate over nepotism in politics - publicly declared during an interaction with the media in Raipur in September that his wife,  , who is the sitting MP from Kannauj, would not contest elections any longer.
 
 "I would like to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha polls from Kannauj because it has been the parliamentary constituency of Lohia ji (Ram Manohar Lohia). The party will take the final call on this," Akhilesh said. He was talking to reporters after paying floral tributes to socialist ideologue Janeshwar Misra on his death anniversary on Monday.
 
 Kannauj has been a stronghold of the Yadav clan for almost two decades. While   won the seat in 1999, Akhilesh was elected MP from Kannauj for three consecutive terms - 2000, 2004 and 2009 - till he resigned in 2012 to be sworn in as the chief minister of UP. In the byelections that followed, Dimple was elected unopposed as MP and re-elected in the 2014 general elections.
 
 
 
 
 SP chief Akhilesh Yadav wished his estranged uncle Shivpal Yadav on his birthday on Monday. On the other hand, Shivpal claimed that the Yadav family was united but some vested interests were trying to damage the party. “Aaj chachaji ka janm din hai … unko janmdin ki bahut habut badhai”, Akhilesh said talking to the media.
