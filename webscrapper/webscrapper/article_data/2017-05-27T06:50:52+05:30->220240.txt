AHMEDABAD: Feeling   in the evening after a day’s work outside? Blame it on the heat. EMRI 108 data on   for May shows that the highest number of emergencies are reported in evening (between 6pm and 11pm) whereas the peak hour is from 9am to 10am reporting 724 emergencies against the hourly average of 506.

  As per EMRI officials, abdominal pain tops the list of heat-related emergencies followed by unconsciousness, fall, chest pain and vomiting. Officials said that it is possible that the reporting is high in the evening hours due to manifestation of the common symptoms of heat-induced exhaustion.
 
 “Heat affects the human body on various levels. In a city like Ahmedabad where the average temperature hovers around 38-40 degrees, prolonged exposure to heat without respite can affect health. When a person is exposed to heat for a long time, the chances of heatstroke get high. The person perspires a lot and the body becomes very hot. It causes dizziness and the person can also lose consciousness,” said an EMRI official.
 
 The paramedics thus advise fluid intake at a regular interval, with electrolytes if exposed to heat outdoors for a longer period, to remain hydrated. They also advise taking break in shade periodically and cover head and face.
