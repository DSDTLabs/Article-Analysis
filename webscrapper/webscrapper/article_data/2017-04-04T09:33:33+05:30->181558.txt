CHENNAI: All the 256 polling booths in   constituency -- where a by-election will be held on April 12 â€“ would be treated as sensitive as directed by Election Commission of India, district election officer (DEO) D Karthikeyan said on Monday.

 "Stringent policing and monitoring of poll-related activities will be extended to all 256 booths," Karthikeyan said at a press conference. The ECI had earlier identified only 50 booths as sensitive. 
 
 With nine days still to go for the byelection, reported instances of model code violations had surged, he said. As many as 145 such complaints had been received and action had been taken on 141 of them, he added. 
 
 Karthikeyan was accompanied by Chennai city commissioner of police Karan Singha, the general observers and police observer for RK Nagar constituency. 
 
 The officers, however, refused to elaborate on the complaint particulars, with Singha adding that it was not appropriate to "mention any party's name in this forum." He confirmed that six people had been arrested on complaints related to cash distribution. 
 
 Karthikeyan said that Rs 7 lakh cash and other gift items had been seized. 
 
 Eight companies of special police forces had already arrived and two more were expected on Monday. These two companies would be deployed for monitoring work in vulnerable areas, Singha said.
 
 On the distribution of voter booth slips, the DEO said the process was in full swing and that it would be completed by Saturday. 
 
 He said while distributing the booth slips, a separate list featuring the names of voters not residing in the constituency, those who have shifted their residence out of the constituency and those who died would be prepared. "Stringent action will be taken against anyone coming to vote using the names of people featured on this list," Karthikeyan said.
 
 Singha inspected the CCTV cameras fitted in Elaya Street in Thiruvalluvar Nagar on Monday.
