KOZHIKODE: The   syndicate has instituted an inquiry into the dismal utilisation of funds allocated to the varsity by the state government so far this financial year.

 The varsity has managed to spend only Rs 5 crore of the Rs 24 crore state plan fund with just a fortnight remaining in the current fiscal.
 
 The syndicate meeting held on Thursday constituted a syndicate panel headed by   to conduct the inquiry and to fix responsibility for the lapses.
 
 The poor utilization of funds has happened despite the state higher education principal secretary informing the varsity well in advance that the unspent funds would get lapsed.
 
 "There have been serious lapses in the timely utilization of funds. The varsity has taken only the first installment of Rs Five crore from the state government. Apart from the around Rs 19 crore remaining in plan fund for this fiscal, there is also a spill over amount of Rs 7.5 crore from last financial year which has also not been utilized. This has happened when the varsity is having pressing academic and infrastructural requirements," syndicate member   said.
 
 The syndicate also formed another subcommittee to conduct an inquiry into the allegation that the rank list prepared by the varsity for the appointment of around 300 assistants in 2016 was leaked.
 
 The decision was taken after the Malappuram district police chief, whom the varsity had asked to inquire into the incident, informed the varsity that the matter necessitated a varsity level enquiry. A four member syndicate committee headed by K K Haneefa will probe into the matter.
 
 The varsity also decided to introduce   to enable students undertake foreign trips to present papers at international seminars and workshops.
