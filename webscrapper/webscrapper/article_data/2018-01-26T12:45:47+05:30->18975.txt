 NAINITAL: The   high court directed the state government on Thursday to identify mentally ill people in the state and provide them medical treatment and care. The court was hearing a PIL on welfare of mentally ill people filed by Haridwar-based doctor  .
  
  The PIL quoting a report by The Times of India stated that children and adult patients have been kept chained in Rudrapur, Udham Singh Nagar district, and other parts of the state. TOI had reported in December that a 14-year old mentally ill girl was found with her legs chained and roaming on the streets of Rudrapur.
  
  The order by single bench of justice   said, “After a complete survey, the report must be submitted within six months. In the meantime, mentally disabled people found on the streets may immediately be sent to medical hospital for treatment.”
  
  Ajay Veer Pundir, counsel for the petitioner, told TOI, “The honorable court ordered to procure and produce data regarding mentally disabled people after reports surfaced that they were not getting treatment or were being kept in chains by their family members.”
  
  The HC also directed the state government and Centre to inform it on the number and condition of mental hospitals in the state and the number of patients treated in these facilities.
  
  The court also asked for details on the number of mentally ill people rehabilitated in the past two years.
