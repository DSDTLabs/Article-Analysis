Salem: Since Sunday, four children died of fever, which their parents claim is dengue, at the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital (SGMKMCH) in the city.

 The dead have been identified as G Sridhar, 14, son of Ganesan, 38, of Maravaneri; R Agalya, 13, daughter of Rajendran, 37, of Kondappanaickenpatty in Namakkal district; M Ayisha, 9, daughter of Mohammed Mohideen of Kalarampatty in Salem; and J Sreesakthi, 3, of Aranaganur near Omalur.
 
 A class 8 student of a government-aided school in the city, Sridhar was suffering from high temperature a few days ago. He was admitted to the SGMKMCH. On Sunday evening, the boy died without responding to treatment.
 
 Agalya, a class 7 student of a government school at Muthukapatty in Namakkal district, was suffering from fever. She was admitted to the government hospital in Namakkal and later shifted to the SGMKMCH three days ago. She died on Sunday evening. Ayisha and Sreesakthi died in the hospital at midnight on Sunday night. “Doctors at the hospital did not give proper treatment to patients,” said Mohammed Mohideen. He alleged the doctors were in a hurry to send the bodies out from the hospital. Similarly, Sreesakthi’s father Jayachandran alleged that the hospital lacked basic amenities. “Drainage water flows on the road and due to that fever spreads to many people in our village,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, hospital dean P Kanagaraj said the doctors in the hospital had tried their best to save dengue patients. He denied the allegations made by the children’parents.
