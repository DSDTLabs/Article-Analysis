GREATER NOIDA: A Mewat-based youth has been arrested for allegedly conniving with a driver transporting   mobile phones to Delhi and stealing around 1,200 handsets on February 15.

 Officials of the company had lodged a complaint against the driver Rahul and cleaner   on February 15. Both are associated with a private contractor engaged in transporting phones from the company’s warehouse.
 
 Faridabad police arrested one   (27), a resident of   in  , on Saturday and as many as 390 Oppo phones were recovered from his possession. The next day, Greater Noida police, who had been in touch with their counterparts in Haryana, arrested Rakesh’s brother Pinku with around Rs 10 lakh.
 
 Rakesh apparently told the police he had received the money from one Man  , a resident of Devdhar in Madhya Pradesh who had sold the phones.
 
 Both the driver Rahul and cleaner Satendra have kept the rest of the money from the theft, the police quoted Pinku as saying. The two are still at large and the rest of the money or the phones are yet to be recovered.
