Citizens moving applications under the Right to Information Act can hope to get their queries addressed at the earliest as the new state chief information commissioner ( ), Sumit Mullick, has said officials delaying such information would be fined.

 Mullick, who retired as chief secretary of   on April 30, took charge on Thursday. The post had been lying vacant after CIC Ratnakar Gaikwad’s term came to an end on June 1, 2017.
 
  
 Mullick said the fine rule would result in better compliance by government officials. Activists have been complaining for long that despite being part of the   Act, the rule was not being implemented. “It is part of the Act and no official can deny information to an applicant,” Mullick said.
 
 With nearly 40,000 cases pending in the state, Mullick is keen to address the pendency issue first and, then, fortify the online system of filing RTI applications and ensuring that all departments put out the RTI complaints and replies on their website. “A note will be issued to all departments,” said the new commissioner.
 
 Mullick said poor management of records by public authorities — which the annual report of the commission has pointed out — was a cause for concern. “Maintaining records has been an issue with all departments. Every department has to develop a mechanism to ensure that all information is in place and with technology they can do so,” Mullick added.
 
 Former chief information commissioner and RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi said, “It would be interesting to see how all the pending cases are disposed of in a year. If the cases are not addressed, it will make the RTI Act weak,’’ he pointed out. Pune, Amravati and Nashik were lagging behind with nearly more than 7,000 cases, he added.
