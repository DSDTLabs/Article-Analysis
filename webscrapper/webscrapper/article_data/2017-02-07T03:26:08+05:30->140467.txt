ISLAMABAD: The Shah Rukh Khan-starrer ' ', a much-awaited film in Pakistan that also features top local actor  , will not be released there due to its "objectionable" content, sources in the country's censor board said on Monday. 

 "T he film portrays Muslims as criminals, violent and terrorists. (Pakistan's)   of Film Certification deemed the film unsuitable for public screening," said a source. "The release certificate cannot be issued to a film that undermines Islam and a specific Muslim sect," the censor board source added. 
 
 Punjab's and Sindh's censor boards had reviewed the film last week but the decision was made on Monday. Pakistan's ban on Indian movies, imposed in view of tense bilateral relations, was lifted earlier this month with the release of 'Kaabil'.
 
 The ban was lifted on February 1 with the release of Hrithik Roshan-starrer Kaabil by Karachi's Atrium Cinemas after Prime Minister   gave the go-ahead to the information, broadcasting and heritage ministry. The information ministry and CBFC also cleared  's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil for screening in Pakistan.
