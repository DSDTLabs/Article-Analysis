PANAJI: If one goes by the current breed of MLAs in the state legislative assembly, all that someone with political ambitions in the state needs is a fat bank balance, to be 60 years old and to have quit schooling midway. It likely won’t matter much if the aspirant is on the wrong side of the law, either.

 Data released by the non-governmental organization,   (ADR), shows that since 2007, the average age of the legislators has risen from 45.6 years to 52.8 years. From average assets of Rs 2.68 crore among 22 legislators in 2007, all 40 MLAs elected to the state legislative assembly in the recently-concluded elections boast of average assets of Rs 10.90 crore. 
 
 “Not a single candidate with less than a crore has won the elections. Of the 67 candidates who declared more than Rs 5 crore in assets, 27 won the election. This is a reality check and goes to show that chances of winning elections are higher if you are a crorepati,” ADR in-charge of the Goa region, Bhasker Assoldekar, said.
 
 Criminal records among MLAs have also seen a rise. While no serious criminal charges were registered against any legislator in 2007, ADR data reveals that 15% of Goa’s recently elected MLAs — namely   (Taleigao), Michael Lobo (Calangute), Vinod Palyekar (Siolim), Govind Gaude (Priol), Digambar Kamat ( ) and   (Benaulim) —have charges ranging from assault, attempt to murder and kidnap, to rape and corruption filed against them. 
 
 Voters also seem to have preferred older aspirants represent them in the legislative assembly this time around, with the average age of MLAs now at 52.8 years as against 45.6 years a decade ago. Although there were eight MLAs in the 31-40 years bracket in 2012, there is none this time around. 
 
 But what Goa’s legislators have in wealth and age, they lack in educational qualifications, data shows. While 17 state they are graduates or above, 23 declare having educational qualifications equivalent to Class XII or below.
