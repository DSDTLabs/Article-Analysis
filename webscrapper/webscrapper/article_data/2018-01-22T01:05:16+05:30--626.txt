GURUGRAM: Sunday morning brought something to cheer, as pollution meters showed Gurgaon with the lowest concentration of particulate matter among   cities, with PM2.5 level at 90.91 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m³). 

 Even peak PM2.5 was 102.55µg/m³, compared to 135.67µg/m³ on Saturday, a decline of about 24%.
 
 Air quality index ( ) was recorded at 230 (considered ‘poor’).
 
  Delhi and Noida reported 274 and 287 respectively — both in the ‘poor’ level, but higher than Gurgaon. 
 
 Faridabad and  , though, hit ‘very poor’ levels of AQI at 314 and 373, respectively.
 
 Officials at   (HSPCB) said atmospheric factors, as well as a strict implementation of dust pollution norms, as reason for the decline. “AQI in Gurgaon has been consistently lower than other NCR cities for the past few days. 
 
 “Gurgaon was the least polluted city in the NCR on Sunday, thanks to better wind speed (9-10 km/hr) and strict check over dust pollution. HSPCB and civic authorities are both working to make sure there’s no waste burning, and there’s no dust in the lower atmosphere,” said a HSPCB official. 
 
 Officials added air quality is likely to get better as showers, expected in the next week, could bring down concentration of particulate matter. \
 
  
  
 
 “Met department forecasts rain on Tuesday. It’s expected to further bring down concentration of particulate matter. 
 
 “However, average minimum temperature is likely to fall, which might trap particulate matter as well,” he said. HSPCB assured it will implement measures under the graded response action plan (GRAP) for the ‘poor’ level.
