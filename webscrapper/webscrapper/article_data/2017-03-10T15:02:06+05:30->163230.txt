MARGAO:   witnessed two major power interruptions on Thursday, the first time due to a local problem and the second time due to a fault in the 220 KV power line bringing in power from Maharashtra.

 Power failed for the first time at 8am and then again at 3pm for a duration of 20 minutes and approximately 90 minutes, respectively. 
 
 South Goa, which incidentally gets its power from the Ambeawadi power station in Karnataka, on Thursday was temporarily shifted to the 220 KV Maharashtra line as the Ambeawadi power station had planned a power shutdown from 10.30am to 6.30pm for upgrading and replacing the protection system.
 
 After the power grid from Maharashtra failed, following a discussion between senior power officials of Goa and Karnataka, Karnataka restored power supply around 4.20 pm. 
 
 Margao assistant engineer Carlos Fernandes told TOI that the 3pm power failure resulted due to a fault in the 220 KV power line from Maharashtra, which supplies power to the Xeldem sub-station. Xeldem sub-station assistant engineer Shivshankar Dessai informed that the problem arose after the earth wire snapped and fell on the 220 KV line.
 
 “The 20-minute   in the morning was due to battery failure at the Xeldem sub-station,” Dessai added.
