NEW DELHI: Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland on Tuesday confirmed that Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were suspended for the final Test at The Wanderers against South Africa and the trio will face further sanctions over the course of the next 24 hours, upon the completion of the   investigation. But, the clean chit given to coach   has raised quite a few eyebrows. 

 
 
 
 
 Sutherland in his press conference had cleared the coach of any prior knowledge of the plan hatched by reported players to deliberately alter the condition of the ball in the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town. However, not many are buying that argument, including former cricketers and cricket pundits. 
 
 
 
 
 
 For instance, Fanie de Villiers, the former South African pacer who had alerted the camera crews about the possible ball tampering attempt said, “There is no way that the coach doesn’t know about it”. 
 
 
 
 
 
 Former Australian skipper Michael Clarke expressed his displeasure with CA’s inability to get the full story out tweeting, “The truth, The full story, Accountability and Leadership- until the public get this Australian cricket is in deep shit!”
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Various social media users, including sports journalists, fans and former cricketers also questioned Lehmann’s clean chit.
