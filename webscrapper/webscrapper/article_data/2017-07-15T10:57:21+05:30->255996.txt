PUNE: Pune has become the first district in the country to have maximum accredited healthcare units in public sector.

 A total of 37   (PHC) located in the district’s rural interiors have earned recognition from the   for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH).
 
 Only a handful of government-run health facilities in the country have managed to crack the exhaustive quality tests needed for the NABH tag.
 
 In a time when government-run hospitals are often criticised for high rates, improper documentation, lack of standard practises and processes, the set of accredited PHCs in the district is expected to shed this image.
 
 Health activists, however, say that sustaining quality standards for a prolonged period is the real challenge for PHCs.
 
 As per NABH’s official website, there are only 51 government-run PHCs in India having NABH accreditation. Among them, a record-breaking 46 PHCs are from Maharashtra alone. Pune and Kolhapur districts have a total 37 PHCs and 9 PHCs accreditated by NABH respectively.
 
 When contacted Dipti Mohan, deputy director of NABH said, “The list of accredited PHCs is given on our website and the information is updated.”
 
 Evaluations of 27 governments-run PHCs are under consideration for accreditation. “Among them, 10 PHCs are from Gujarat, four from Haryana and the remaining 13 from Pune district,” said another NABH official.
 
 Senior IAS officer, Pradeep Vyas, commissioner of   and the director, National Health Mission, Maharashtra said,“We aim to seek NABH accreditation for all districts, general and sub-district (50-100 beds) hospitals, 90 rural hospitals and 170 PHCs in the state.”
