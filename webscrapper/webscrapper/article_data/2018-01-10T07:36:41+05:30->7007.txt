DHARAMSHALA: Congress legislature   (51), the man who changed the scenario in   by defeating CM designate PK Dhumal in   constituency of   district, has said Dhumal was misguided by his people and it was his mistake to contest from Sujanpur constituency.

 “It is not Dhumal, but the people have rejected his team that misused his name on various platforms after he was declared CM candidate,” he said while talking to TOI. 
 
 Rana was here to attend the first winter session of   assembly. “I have been running an NGO from the past 16 years and working for the welfare of the people. Through this I was in touch with the people of this area,” he said.
 
 Rana’s NGO Sarv Kalyankari Sanstha has been contributing for the marriages of girls and education of children from poor families. It has also made in-roads to the voters through mahila mandals of the constituency.
 
 “Out of total 103 booths in Sujanpur, I took lead in 59 while Dhumal was ahead in 44. However, about 40 booths had come from Bamsan constituency that was earlier represented by Dhumal,” Rana said.
 
 “I feel more responsibility towards my people, who have chosen me to represent them. I would try hard to come up to their expectations” he added.
 
 Rana had won elections with a margin of 1919 votes. He secured 25,288 votes while Dhumal stood at 23,369.
