NEW DELHI:   appears to have conclusively identified Pakistan-based   (LeT) as the terror outfit behind the attack at an Army camp in Uri in September last year, contradicting the Army's initial claim naming   as the prime suspect. 

 An NIA officer said the role of LeT is clear from three leads so far in the investigation. First is the data retrieved from the GPS set used by the Uri terrorists that shows up coordinates of Lashkar launchpads across the LoC in PoK. The officer said though the route taken by them to reach Uri was deleted and could not be recovered, the coordinates from PoK clearly point to LeT launchpads. Second, the matrix sheet contains the codes associated with LeT. Last but not the least were the posters in Gujranwala in Pakistan announcing 'namaz-e-janaja' (funeral prayers) on behalf of LeT for one of the slain Uri attackers.
 
 NIA officials pointed to similarities between the Uri strike and   of October, which establish Lashkar as a common link.
