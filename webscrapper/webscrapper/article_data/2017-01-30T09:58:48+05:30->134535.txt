NAGPUR: NCP office bearer from Central Nagpur Ratnamala Narayan   has become the first person to file nomination form in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections. Umredkar filed the form with returning officer of Lakadganj Zone Shirish Pande on Sunday.

 Umredkar will contest from ward no-22 from seat-C that is general for women. Ward covers Queta Colony, Sangha building premises, Old Bagadganj, Gangabai ghat area etc.
 
 However, Umredkar has created some controversy. She filed nomination form from NCP before getting A&B form from the party. However, she can submit the forms by last date of nomination that is on February 3.
 
 NCP is yet to finalize the candidates. NCP city parliamentary board will meet on Monday and finalize the candidates. Also, NCP is likely to release first list of candidates on Monday. It is a system that candidates of major parties do not file nomination forms before approval in parliamentary board.
 
 NCP sources told TOI that Umredkar submitted form with NCP and also appeared in the interviews so might be sure to get ticket so went on to file nomination form.
 
 NCP will also finalize number of seats to its ally —   — in the parliamentary board meeting.
 
 In some setback, NCP did not receive form from its senior corporator Pragati Patil who is aspiring ticket from   and Congress.
 
 In first two days, no nominations were received by the NMC.
