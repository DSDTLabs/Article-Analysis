MUMBAI: Deprecating the act of 30 'fake' doctors of filing discharge applications in an attempt to protract the trial in a 16-year-old case, a magistrate's court rejected their pleas and imposed a penalty of Rs 5,000 on each of them.

 In 2001, the   had arrested over 300 'bogus' doctors who allegedly procured `fake' Bachelor of   and   from other states, registered with   and were practising in Mumbai. Police had also arrested then registrar Mohammed Usmani for aiding and abetting the accused.Of the 300 accused, 30 were booked for cheating and forgery. The matter came up for trial before magistrate S V Sahare.
 
 In December 2016, the magistrate observed that charges levelled against a few of the accused were not proper--IPC section 467 was not applicable to all--and said the charges need to be “modified“. Defence lawyers said that if fresh charges were to be framed against the accused, all previous charges would stand vitiated and they could seek discharge under the Criminal Procedure Code.
 
 In January , one of the accused, Sunil Patwardhan, filed a discharge application saying “the FIR was based on hearsay and filed with ulterior motive“.It was signed by 29 co-accused.
 
 The prosecutor opposed the plea saying it was a “serious offence“ in which charges were framed in 2007 and altered in 2016. “It is nothing but protracting tactics. The conduct of accused persons shows they do not want to get the trial to proceed.Such conduct is deprecated,“ the magistrate observed.
