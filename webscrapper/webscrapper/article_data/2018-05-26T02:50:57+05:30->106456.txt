MUMBAI:   police on Thursday registered a case of cheating against a woman, after an 83-year-old woman lodged a complaint alleging she duped her of Rs 53 lakh, by promising admission for her grandson in a post-graduate medical course in Navi Mumbai. 

  Dadar resident Premlata Singh said the cheating took place in October 2015-April 2016. "I met   at her Worli residence, where she promised a seat in MGM College," Singh told police.
 
  She said   claimed she had contacts who could arrange the seat. She said the deal had been finalized and she paid Rs 54 lakh. The accused failed to secure admission for Premlata's grandson, Shivam Singh. When Singh kept asking either for the admission or her money, Sharma returned Rs 50,000. No arrests have been made yet.
 
  After his father's death, the son returned from Delhi to Mumbai, to live with his grandparents. Singh's husband was with the Kolkata police. She had given money from her pension fund, taken a loan against gold jewellery and used up her savings, she said.
