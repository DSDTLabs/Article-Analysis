PATNA: Former deputy CM   said on Tuesday the record of voluntary blood and   is dismal compared to other states in the country. He said it reflected poorly on the   of the people of the state for others.

 Speaking at a function organised to mark the 97th foundation day of  , he said the government blood banks meet the demands of only 16% needy persons. Blood collected through   are stored in blood banks. He said there are no functional blood banks in Jamui, Araria and four other districts. 
 
 Stating that the incapacity of the blood banks to fulfil the demands of the needy was symptomatic of the poor record of voluntary blood donation in the state, Modi said, adding that people should also realise that ‘jeete ji raktdaan, mrityu ke baad angdaan (blood donation when alive, limb donation after death)’ constitutes the “meaningfulness of one’s life”.
 
 Furthermore, only 550 blood donation camps were organised in the state last year against the national record of 70,000 during the same period, Modi said. On the other hand, West Bengal organised 12,000 blood donation camps and Odisha 2,000 in 2016, he added.
 
 As a result of not so inspiring people’s response to voluntary blood donation and equally fewer number of such camps in Bihar, only 1.10 lakh units of blood are collected annually, when the overall annual demand for blood for patients afflicted with various ailments is 10.30 lakh units, Modi said.
 
 Incidentally, the volume of stored blood in Delhi is three times the annual demand there, while in Maharashtra, Punjab, Kerala and Gujarat, its volume is one and half times of the total annual demand — all through voluntary donation, Modi added.
 
 Similarly, with regard to Bihar’s poor record in eye donation, Modi said the total eyes donated in various parts of the country last year was 59,810 to which Bihar’s contribution was only 30. As many as 11,051 people had donated their eyes in Tamil Nadu, 8,436 in Gujarat and 6,171 in Telangana, he added.
