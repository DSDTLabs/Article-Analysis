BHOPAL: The   of a 26-year-old woman was found missing after her body was taken out of the morgue at a hospital in   on Saturday. While doctors claimed the eye was gouged out by lizards, the deceased’s family alleged foul play.

 After allegedly consuming poison, Raksha Katare was admitted to   on Thursday where she died during treatment on Friday. Her body was shifted to the morgue for autopsy scheduled the next day.
 
 On Saturday, when her family arrived to claim the body, they found her right eye was missing. The authorities, however, couldn’t give an explanation for the same, further arousing suspicion.
 
 “The doctors said lizards must have taken the eye away,” said Katare’s uncle N P Awasthi, adding that they suspect the hospital might have illegally extracted her eye for transplant without intimating the family.
 
 JAH Hospital has been in the news for quite some time over alleged cases of corruption. In a recent case, hospital doctors allegedly junked donated corneas, following which a high level inquiry revealed that doctors had conducted only one eye transplant in six years, even as 80 organs were donated during the same period.
