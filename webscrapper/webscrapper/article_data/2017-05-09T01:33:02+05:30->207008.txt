NEW DELHI: The   (CBSE) conducted the   ( ) amid unprecedented security on Sunday.

 But was the question paper error free? In an exam, where over 11 lakh aspirants took the test, experts claim there are at least four questions which have problems.
 
 One question came with two correct options, while another came with all four wrong multiple choice answers, this is not the first time as NEET 2016 too had errors in the question paper. In fact the Joint Entrance Examination (Main) 2015 conducted by CBSE had similar errors while the JEE (advanced) of 2016 had four errors of 12 marks.
 
 “A nation of a billion plus people and an emerging knowledge super power should be able to make its entrance exam papers error freeStudents are stuck up in wrong questions and waste considerable time,” said S K Singh, director, Oasis Educational Services.
 
 Experts analysing the question paper (Paper code ‘P’) claims that question number 4 has been phrased incorrectly. Here “instead of ‘Which of the following pairs of compounds is isoelectronic and isostructural?’ is should have been ‘Which of the following pairs of compounds is isostructural and has same number of valence electrons?” pointed out Gaurav Singhal, a physics teacher. Singhal also highlighted “error” in question number 159 on the paper of code ‘P’.
 
 The other two “errors” highlighted are the question number 149 and 175. Despite attempts made to contact CBSE including email with specific querry on questions, no response was received till filing of the report.
