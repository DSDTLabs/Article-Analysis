MUMBAI: The BMC has so far collected nearly Rs100 crore more   compared to last year, but may not be able to meet the Rs 5,200 crore target the civic body has set for the financial year 2017-18, officials say. 

 According to civic assessment and collector department officials, Rs 3,746 crore has been collected as property tax till February 28— up from Rs 3,647 crore during the same period in 2016-17. With just a month left for the financial year to end, the deficit is Rs 1,454 crore now.
 
 However, some civic officials say they are expecting a significant increase in collections this month, they have previously observed that many rush to pay the tax in the last days of the year. Last year, BMC had collected Rs 375 crore on March 31 alone. “We hope to increase the collections like last year, which when collected Rs 4,800 crore till March 31,” said an official. Last year too, the BMC had missed the target for property tax collection. 
 
 Following the phasing out of octroi with the introduction of GST, property tax is one of the highest revenue source of BMC followed by development charges. Officials say that in order to ensure higher property tax collection, they have issued demand notices to almost 1.7 lakh defaulting establishments and sealed 196 of them this year. Around 4,000 plus property tax defaulters alone owe BMC over Rs 9,000 crore over the years, officials say.
 
 “Apart from sending demand notice and sealing properties, other steps taken by us also include disconnection of water supply and attachment of properties. In this year alone 58 water connections were disconnected and 72 properties attached for non-payment of property tax,” said  , assistant commissioner (Assessment and  ).
