HYDERABAD: At a time when the city police has launched a massive crackdown on gutkha supply, the problem still persists. The main hurdle in weeding the menace out completely is that manufacturing is being done in a discreet manner in quiet corners of the city.

 Cops said they have observed that gutkha is being made in smaller units, including residences. These, they said, are in the lanes and bylanes of the Old City and peripheral areas.
 
 “We have observed that gutkha, khaini and zarda are being made in areas such as Katedan, Mailardevpally,   and Ra jendra Nagar. The units and homes are in remote areas of these neighbourhoods. And this is being done very quietly,“ a cop said.
 
 The task force and law and order units have been pressed into action to deal with the menace. According to deputy commissioner of police ( ) V Satyanarayana, as many as 20 raids have yielded several hundred packets of gutkha.
 
 “We raided places in Chandrayangutta and   on Thursday . During our drive, we found out that manufacturing is being done in houses and smaller units.We are booking cheating cases and cases under sections 272 (adulteration of food or drink) and 273 (sale of noxious food or drink). We have stopped the menace to a large extent, but it is an ongoing process,“ Satyanarayana said. While there are an estimated 75,000 pan shops in the city, the number in the Old City runs into a few thousand.
