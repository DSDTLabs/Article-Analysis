PANAJI:   national president Amit   will address party workers at   indoor stadium on Sunday. Shah, who was earlier scheduled to meet alliance partners and also the party MLAs and MPs, will now only be addressing the party workers due to change in his schedule, a BJP functionary said. This is Shah’s first visit to Goa after chief minister Manohar Parrikar’s hospitalisation in February. 

 The BJP functionary said the party expects at least 15,000 party workers from across the state.
