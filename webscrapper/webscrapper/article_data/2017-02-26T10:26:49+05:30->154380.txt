Leonara D’Costa of Mirabhag, Sanvordem, is among the few Goan women khell directors who continues to make her presence felt in this traditional folk art form that reverberates during carnival in Goa. 

 Despite her advancing age, she refuses to call it quits and is still active on the Konkani stage, composing and singing solos for tiatr directors such as   and Peter-Roshan, among others, when she is not directing her own khells.
 
 In March 2014, D’Costa, teamed up with another woman khell director,  , and created history by staging the first, all-women khell. Female artistes performed all the roles in the three plays titled, ‘Mog Tho Mog’ (Love is love), ‘Kednach Korchinam’ (Will never do it) and ‘Chukh Zali’ (Made a mistake). Widely advertised as a ‘ladies only’ drama, the khell met with great success and saw 57 shows being staged all over the state. 
 
 While a dearth of sponsors and the demonetization dilemma have dashed her hopes of bringing out yet another all-women khell this carnival, D’Costa is not one to call it quits. After intense rehearsals, she will present her latest offering, ‘Hi Munnxea Vo Zonnvara’ (Are these men or animals), ‘Sangat Mhaka’ (Tell me) and ‘Tumi’ (You) on Sunday, at 6.30pm at Chandor. More showings will follow at Fatorda, Cortalim, Navelim, Cuncolim, Pontemol and Mirabhag before Lent begins.
