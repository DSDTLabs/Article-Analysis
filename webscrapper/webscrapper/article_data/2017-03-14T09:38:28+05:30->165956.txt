KOLKATA: The city proved that more indeed leads to a merrier time as it celebrated the festival of colours two days in a row — Dol on Sunday and   on Monday. 

 While vehicles largely remained away from the roads on both days, people with their faces smeared with colours, to the extent of being unrecognizable, were a common sight.
 
 Debolina Roy played with colours on Sunday as well as Monday. “We in Kolkata have the rare good fortune of celebrating the festival of colours on two days while the entire country gets only one. I will make most of the opportunity by playing dol on both days with different sets of friends,” said the Dum Dum Park resident. On Sunday, she played with her family and friends in the   and on Monday she painted the town red with her college friends. 
 
 Sudder Street erupted with colours on Sunday as locals played dol with nationals of several countries. “I have seen a festival like this for the first time in my life,” said Wong Lee, a Chinese national who is putting up in a hotel on Sudder Street. Early in the morning, the hotel staff took him by surprise by smearing abir on his face. 
 
 Residents of Kankurgachi were preparing for holika dahan on Sunday evening. “We will play Holi on Monday after holika dahan today. There will be a big get together at the park here,” said Avinash Agarwal, a resident of Kankurgachi.
 
 Monday started on a colourful note. The trading hub of Burrabazar sported several hues since morning. People walkied from one house to another to extend Holi greetings. 
 
 “The Holi of Burrabazar is famous in the entire country,” said Bajrnag Ruia, a resident of Burrabazar.
