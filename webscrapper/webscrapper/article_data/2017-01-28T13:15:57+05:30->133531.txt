Sanjay Dutt's comeback film 'Bhoomi' will kick off in Agra on February 14th with   playing his daughter and   a tour guide and his best friend. 

  
  
 Shekhar returns to movies after over a decade. He was last seen at length in 'Ek Se Badhkar Ek' in 2004. The veteran actor pointed out that it's an exciting role with an exciting director and co-star.
 
  "I've known   Kumar since his TV days. He was a host then and had designed the sets of many of my shows. I was pleasantly surprised when he turned director and like his choice of sub jects, be it Mary Kom or Sarbjit," asserted Shekar who'd lost Chunni babu's role in Devdas to Jackie Shroff because he'd wanted to sleep on his decision and director Sanjay Leela Bhansali couldn't wait. "I regret I lost the opportunity. This time I was sure I wanted to take up this film as even the producer Sandeep Singh is close to me."
 
 Shekhar played  's brother in 'Insaaf Apne Lahoo Se' and recalls that there was so much chaos due to the presence of  , who gave the mahurat clap, that they forgot their lines. "Whenever we meet, we still laugh over this incident. I admire Sanjay's perseverance and resilience," says Shekhar who loved  's Raju guide in Vijay Anand's 'Guide'.
 
  "In our last film together, Sanjay and I played brothers, here we are friends who are almost like brothers whose lives are changed by certain incidents which happen in Agra. Its an action film with an emotional connect," he reveals. Omung adds that he thought about Shekhar because he needed an actor who is proficient in several languages and recalls it took him just five minutes to give his nod.
