BENGALURU: There may be no evidence to show that ayurveda can cure cancer but a lot of research is going into treating patients with integrated medicine. According to Dr G G  , director,   and  , every cancer patient requires specific treatment, considering the complexity of the disease.

 “Merely starting an outpatient department won't work unless the ayurveda specialist gains expertise in one or two types of cancers. They have to adopt a highly specialized treatment mode. That's how ayurveda practitioners can win the confidence of oncologists, with whom they need to constantly engage,“ he said.
 
 Dr Gangadharan said the treatment mode for each patient is different and medicine quality shouldn't be compromised. Most drugs have to be prepared by the ayurveda doctor himself, he added.
 
 The doctor is currently treating a patient in her late 30s with breast cancer, which spread to the lungs. “Every patient's treatment plan has to be thoroughly prepared after consulting a panel of experts,“ he said, adding that complications like nausea, vomiting and hairfall during radiation therapy can be reduced.
 
 Dr   of HCG said over-the-counter ayurvedic drugs that claim to cure cancer should not be bought. “Some metals in ayurvedic drugs can increase toxic elements in the body . Alternative therapy should be adopted in consultation with the oncologist,“ he said.
