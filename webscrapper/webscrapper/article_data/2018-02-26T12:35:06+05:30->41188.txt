PATNA: The two suspects arrested from Gaya on February 10 for allegedly owing allegiance to Islamic State (IS) were asked to purchase as much firearms as possible from Bihar before going to Jammu and Kashmir for   training, the   (NIA) sources said.

 Earlier also, the terrorists involved in Dhaka’s   attack had smuggled the AK-22s from Munger to Bangladesh. Indian girl Tarishi Jain was among the 24 people killed in the terror attack in Dhaka on July 1, 2016.
 
 Mohammad Anwar Hussain, Mohammad Shammi and Mohammad Shaad were arrested from Maroofganj locality under the Civil Lines police station area in Gaya on February 10 after Uttar Pradesh Anti-terrorism Squad (ATS) shared intelligence about the trio with NIA and Intelligence Bureau (IB). Shaad was later released on personal bond while the other two were sent to jail.
 
 A 9mm country-made pistol was also recovered from them. They were scheduled to leave for Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) for terror training. Hussain had transferred funds on several occasion to the terror organization Harkat-ul-Mujahideen active in the Valley. 
 
 Sources said Hussain and Shammi accepted that they had been asked by their links in Kashmir to arrange whatever weapons they could from Bihar. “Hussain was on the job, but did not reveal where he had procured the pistol from,” sources said.
 
 An IPS officer said such country-made weapons are easily available at very cheap rates in Munger, which is a hub of major manufacturing illegal arms. “While parts of firearms are made in Malda and its surrounding areas in  , these are assembled and given finishing touch in Munger,” he said.
 
 Incidentally, Patna police on IB input, had arrested Jaswinder Singh (28),   (27), Navdeep Singh (28) and Bachittar Veer Singh (27) from Jauhari Niwas, a guesthouse in Patna city on February 1. They had come from Amritsar in Punjab to purchase illegal firearms.
