The two have been identified as Tushant Pandey (35) and Sonu Azad (30). The 26-year-old chartered accountant, said she had paid Rs 15,000 to the two to shift her goods from her flat in Shipra Sun City in Indirapuram to her hometown in UP.
 
 The duo led cops to a godown in Sector 2, from where the stolen goods were recovered. The godown was stashed with lot of household goods, cops said.
 
 The chartered accountant told TOI she had come across the contact numbers of the two men from website ‘gati’, which police suspect had been phished. “I had to shift to a hostel in Delhi for studies. So I decided to send my goods from Indirapuram to my hometown in UP. The two men took away the goods on February 27 after I paid them Rs 15,000. However, they demanded more money to deliver the goods to my home. Later, they stopped taking calls and instead asked me to contact a third person, a transporter, to get my goods. The transporter, too, demanded money for handing over the goods. They kept playing a cat and mouse game with me till the end of March, when I finally informed police,” she said.
 
 “The gang has been active in Delhi-NCR for the past few years. There have been several instances in which they did not return the goods despite taking additional money from clients,” said SHO, Indirapuram, Sachin Malik.
