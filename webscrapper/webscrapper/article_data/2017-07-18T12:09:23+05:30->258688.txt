AHMEDABAD:After incessant rainfall lashing the city for over two days, rains remained relatively mild on Sunday with drizzles occurring in some parts of Ahmedabad. According to India Meteorological Department (IMD), Gujarat, rain showers may lessen on Monday.

 IMD said Ahmedabad received 8.7mm rainfall between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Sunday. Some parts of the city like Navrangpura, Ashram road, Satellite, Vastrapur, Vejalpur, Sarkhej, Narol, Odhav, Bapunagar, Nikol and   received light rains in the morning. The rains took a break in the afternoon, and began again in evening in many parts of the city. However, the Sunday rains did not increase woes of people as the afternoon respite from rain prevented waterlogging.
 
 As the rains took a break, many Amdavadis rushed to recreational spots like Sabarmati riverfront, Kankaria lakefront, SG Road and Law Garden to enjoy the pleasant and breezy weather.
 
 According to IMD forecast, the city is likely to witness rains and thundershowers only in some areas, which means that the rainfall may reduce on Monday.
 
 IMD said that monsoon was vigorous over Saurashtra and Kutch region on Sunday. This was due to morningâ€™s low pressure area over southwest Rajasthan and   and adjoining regions including Saurashtra and Kutch. Besides, there is another active system with development of a feeble off-shore trough along the coastal areas of South Gujarat which intensified rains in the region.
