TRICHY: Have you spotted joggers of late totting bin bags as they go about their routine runs on the streets? Or their glove-clad hands filled with detritus and old   picked up from parks and playgrounds? Chances are that you might soon. 

 Plogging — the latest   craze of   — is making its way onto the streets of   and, if done properly, could keep you in shape and save the planet. The new workout involves putting on your gloves while going for a run and then scouring the area for litter, which you can dispose of at your leisure later.
 
 The city corporation, which is all set to become the first civic body in the state to introduce plogging, has planned to promote the fitness regimen among joggers and strollers groups, hoping that the fusion of fitness and environment friendly activities could bring about behavioural changes among the public.
 
 Conceptualised in Sweden in 2016, plogging is fast catching on in parts of the European and American continents as a phenomenon combining fitness and cleanliness activities. Anyone on their routine stroll or jog could be a plogger by just carrying a bin bag and picking up litter, mostly plastic, along their way. 
 
 The litter can either be dumped in public bins or handed over to sanitary workers in the door-to-door waste collection process. 
 
 “The outcome of such measures may not be as visible as we think but people taking part in it will realise the impact caused by throwing away waste on the roads,” N Ravichandran, commissioner, Trichy corporation told TOI. With the World Earth Day approaching, the corporation has planned to commence plogging on April 22, hoping to involve residents’ welfare associations, self-help groups, and jogging clubs in the mission.
