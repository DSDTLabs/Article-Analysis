PANAJI: The city recorded the highest   of 26.8mm, while   recorded 24.6mm in the last 24 hours due to a depression in an area southeast of the  , as the weather system weakened into a well-marked low pressure area.

 The city was lashed by showers after midnight on Thursday for more than half an hour, accompanied by lightning and thunder. While Mormugao recorded 10.6mm of rainfall, Mapusa recorded 2.6mm, Valpoi 1.8mm and Ponda 1.0mm.
 
 The well-marked pressure area over Lakshadweep and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea also has an associated upper air cyclonic circulation, which is likely to move northwestwards and weaken gradually. But meteorologists at the   (IMD) expect the condition to persist for at least 24 to 48 hours.
 
 As southerly winds are blowing in, they are bringing in lot of moisture. “There are possibilities of isolated rain or thundershowers in the state,” Rahul M, scientist, IMD,  , said.
 
 The minimum temperature recorded on Thursday was 22.3C - just a degree above normal. The maximum temperature was 31.8C - almost half a degree below normal. 
 
 The widespread showers brought relief from the sultry heat, but cashew farmers are worried that the showers may continue. “A brief spell of rain may not cause damage, but if the rain persists, then it may damage the fruit and the flower,” a cashew farmer said.
