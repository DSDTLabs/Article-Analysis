L.A. detective Elvis Cole and his sidekick Joe Pike return in bestselling author Robert Crais’s latest book 
  
 . The riveting thriller largely revolves around a mother’s concern for her son, who is probably stalked by some goons. With interesting events and compelling twists, the problem appears much more sinister than it first sounds.

 A pair of deadly assassins, by the names Harvey and Stemms, are after Tyson Connor, a teenage boy who has apparently robbed a lot of cash and jewellery from some wealthy and vicious people. After he mysteriously disappears, Tyson’s mother Devon contacts Detective Cole. It soon turns out that the awkward teenager Tyson is a member of a gang that has robbed multiple homes. While Cole and Pike strive to unearth the mystery, one of Tyson’s accomplices dies. The killers find out that the kids have a stolen computer with invaluable information that they would happily kill to retrieve. Cole and Pike embark on a mission to find them before the killers.
 
 The narrative of Harvey and Stemms run parallel with Tyson’s story, making the thriller immensely engrossing. There is less violence depicted in 
  
  than Crais’s previous Elvis Cole novels and the plot does not appear as the most extraordinary. However, the narrative and the way the events unfold make the book an example of Crais’s craftsmanship. The author’s depiction of a mother’s emotional upheavals and a teenager’s frustrations is remarkable.
