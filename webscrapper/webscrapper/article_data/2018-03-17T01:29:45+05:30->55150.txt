NEW DELHI: The directorate of education conducted a draw of lots for quota seats on Thursday, after several delays and legal hiccups. According to officials, the draw for nearly 50,000 seats was done successfully, and messages were sent to parents whose wards’ names had come in the draw.

 Senior   officials said 1.28 lakh   had been received for the quota seats in private schools this year. This was for 40,000 seats for this year, and around 6,000 seats from last year.
 
 The addition of last year seats was done to this year’s tally on the direction of the high court, which had found that several quota seats had gone unoccupied in private schools in the 2017-18 session. A direction to this effect was also delivered by a division bench in January that was received by the DoE on the day of the draw of lots earlier this month. This fresh legal twist had prompted the directorate to delay draw of lots until the next court hearing, in order to buy time to be “on the right side of the law”.
