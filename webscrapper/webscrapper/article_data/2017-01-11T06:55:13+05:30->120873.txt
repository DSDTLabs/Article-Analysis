HYDERABAD: The   after   has not only inconvenienced tenants, but also brought to fore the ugly face of Hyderabad's cash-driven   ­thriving around certain residential pockets.

 Populated largely by a 'migrant' crowd of young professionals, these pockets house several   -often constructed illegally -whose owners throw rules to the wind while leasing the space in order to evade tax. Ideally, the lease document drawn up at the start of tenancy has to be registered with the government. But several landlords do not do so, either to conceal their actual income or to keep their 'illicit' homes away from the prying eyes of officials. Result: tenants are forced to resort to forgery.
 
 “I needed a rental agreement as proof of address to get an LPG connection, but my house-owner refused. I had to get one made at the local notary without my landlord's knowledge. I had no other option,“ said Ashok Chandra (name changed), a resident of Kukatpally.
 
 It is mostly in such residential properties that landlords insist on rent in cash. Despite the many difficulties due to renting a place without papers -including arranging for an address proof for bank account or declaring investment in office records -such properties rarely face a dearth of tenants. This, courtesy a steady influx of young professionals into the city.
 
 “The greater the illegality, the higher the cash component. Real estate employs a good amount of cash and is the main source of absorption of black money. The trend is seen more in areas with sufficient land for development. But demonetisation and rules making it mandatory to provide PAN for transactions above Rs 20,000 by developers have brought the figures down," said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director of Liases Foras, a realty research agency.
 
 Not all are of the same opinion though. Some market observers say the cash-driven `industry' is here to stay despite the Centre's push for online transactions.
