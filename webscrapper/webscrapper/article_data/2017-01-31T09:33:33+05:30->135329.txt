VADODARA: Body of the army sepoy who died in an avalanche in Jammu & Kashmir a few days ago will land in Godhra on Tuesday afternoon. Sunil Patel’s body will be flown to Vadodara and then it will be airlifted to  . 

 “We have made all the necessary arrangements to ensure that Patel’s body reaches his home on Tuesday,” said Panchmahals district collector P Bharthi.
 
 Patel’s family, though, isn’t happy about the absence of a proper motorable road in their village. “We don’t have a motorable road in Balupura village. So we had to make a temporary road to ensure that the vehicle that brings my son’s dead body will be able to reach my home. The deputy sarpanch of my village and other locals are doing the needful,” said Takhatsingh, Sunil’s father. 
 
 He added that the population of Balupura that is a part of the Orwada village is about 4,000 and hence there should be a proper road there.
