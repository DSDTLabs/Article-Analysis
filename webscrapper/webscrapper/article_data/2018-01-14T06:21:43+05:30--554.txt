CHANDERNAGORE: Not every day does a Frenchman cruise down the   to visit a Bengali town. But French envoy   carried a special interest on Friday afternoon: to forge a   between the   government and the “people at large” and rescue the Registry Building, which his forefathers built in the erstwhile French colony centuries ago.

 “The pilot project will see Chandernagore’s comeback on the Indo-French map, ushering in many such conservation initiatives,” said Zielgler. In all, 99 dilapidated buildings are on his list of mustrescue in Chandernagore.
  
 The Registry Building or the first French courthouse at the Strand, facing the river, is in ruins. “Trees have grown all over it. The roof is falling apart. We have saved the building, declared condemned, from the hammer. Now we must stop it from collapsing,” rued French consul general  , who accompanied Ziegler. According to Syed, the restoration will require Rs 2 crore, which is being channelized through the Bonjour India festival that kicked off in Jaipur in last November.
 “The PPP is actually a crowdfunding where anybody can participate — government, international agencies and citizens,” explained conservation architect Aishwarya Tipnis, awarded the Chevalier de l’Ordre des Arts et Letters, France’s top cultural award for her “outstanding commitment” to the preservation of Indo-French heritage, in Kolkata on Thursday.
 
 
  
 Architecture students from Paris’ Confluence Institute and   made a detailed project report for the building, during a week-long workshop before Zeigler’s visit. “France and Chandernagore share a strong history,” said Basabi Pal, head of French department at Chandernagore College.
 
 Chandernagore on the banks of the Hooghly, about 60km from Kolkata, became a French colony in 1673. The French lost the town to the British in the 1757 Battle of Chandernagore and took control of it in 1816, though it remained a French territory in India till 1950.
