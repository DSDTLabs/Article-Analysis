NEW DELHI: The   for   to   for this   is going to start  . 

 This year, there will be no separate registration for entrance-based undergraduate programmes and aspirants can register through the centralised admission portal for all courses. “Single-point registration will ensure that all the data are centrally located and the admission committee has access to them at one place”. The first cutoff is likely to come out in the second week of June.
 
 Earlier, the entrance-based undergraduate courses usually had a separate registration process that started from the first week of April. However, the change in the registration format has delayed the entire process by two weeks this time. According to DU officials, the admission committee took its time to ensure the issues faced by aspirants were resolved. “After last year’s experience, we are ensuring that the admission portal is more student-friendly.”
 
 As the state Board has already started declaring results, the DU admission committee is also likely to start the registration process for merit-based courses. “The registrations for merit-based courses will continue till June...by then, all the education Boards would have declared their results. However, the registration for the entrance-based programmes would get over by the third week of May. The dates for the entrance exam are likely to be declared by the first week of May,” said the official.
 
 A source in the DU admission committee said, “The student can register first and can contact us in case she/he faces any issue. Since the registration period is pretty long, the aspirant can wait till the issue is resolved before making payment”. The admission portal will also allow the committee to track the number of seats filled and withdrawals in real time.
