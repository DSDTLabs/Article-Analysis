PANAJI: The high court of Bombay at Goa dismissed a petition filed by a prisoner seeking parole to undertake  . 

 A division bench of justices Anoop V Mohta and C V Bhadang held that need to undertake agricultural operations is not set as a reason for grant of parole.
 
 “We are unable to accept that such a ground or reason can be covered with the aid of the later part of the rule where it says that parole can be granted for “any other sufficient cause”, the high court observed while rejecting the petition filed challenging the order of the inspector general of prisons (IGP).
 
 Santan Rebelo, who is serving a sentence at the central jail, Colvale, had approached the high court after the IGP rejected his parole plea on the ground that Rule 324 of the  , 2006, does not contemplate release on parole on the ground of carrying out agriculture operations.
 
 Rule 324 of the Prison Rules states that parole may be granted to a prisoner “in the event of emergent situations like death or serious illness of father, mother, brother, sister, spouse and children, and also marriage of brother, sister and children, or for any other sufficient cause.”
 
 Counsel for petitioner T   argued that Rule 324 also permits release of a prisoner on parole “for any other sufficient cause”.
 
 The need for carrying agriculture operations would come within the ambit of a sufficient cause entitling the petitioner to be released on parole, he added.
 
 The government counsel S R Rivonkar submitted that the unless and until it is shown that there is any emergent situation, no parole could be granted.
