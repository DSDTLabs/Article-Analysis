JAGATPUR/MEHANDPUR ( ): Families of IS victims   Kumar and Jasvir Singh on Monday claimed the men could have been saved if the central government had acted on time.

 One of the families claimed that they had come to know after the abduction of 40 Indians in June 2014 that the IS had set certain conditions before the Government of India, but it didn’t concede to their demands.
 
 “We had heard that the IS had set a deadline of 11 days for the government, including freeing of some of their leaders but our government didn’t concede to their demands and result is before all to see. The Government of India could have taken steps in the start, but I don’t know why they didn’t take measures to save our son,” said 70-year-old Jeet Ram, an ex-serviceman and father of Parvinder Kumar. “For four years, we died every moment as the government kept us in dark. During our 15 meetings with external affairs ministry we were told that the authorities have talked to them and they are fine. I don’t know the politics of it as to why we were kept in dark for this long.”
 
 Parvinder’s brother   said he had gone to Doha in March, but returned in 20 days after he heard about his brother’s death.
 
 Around 20km away, another family was grieving for its son who it thought would bring it out of poverty.
 
 “The government had time after our son was kidnapped to negotiate with the IS, but we don’t know the reason as to why they didn’t. The government didn’t do anything that time,” said  , elder brother of the deceased Jasvir Singh, who worked as a labourer in Iraq.
 
 Jasvir’s father  , 70, who cannot hear properly, said his life has no meaning now. He added that the government should at least compensate them and provide a job to one of their family members.
 
 Of three surviving sons, Bakshish’s eldest son Surinderpal went to Dubai two months ago for work and his two daughters are married.
