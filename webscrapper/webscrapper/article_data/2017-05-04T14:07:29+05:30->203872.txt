HYDERABAD: Brave, lively,  . These were the of-repeated compliments for   by friends and   . 

 Sandhya's friends suspect foul play in her death and are planning to approach the Telangana home minister to demand a thorough investigation in her case.
 
 "No stone should be left unturned in the case. She informed her boss that she will be late by an hour on the day of her death, why will a person planning to end her life bother about her job?" asked  , her colleague at Radio Charminar.
 
 Her friends described her as the man of her house as she was looking after her family for over five years before she got married. Her dream was to become a good home-maker and a good mother apart from being a radio jockey.
 
 A day before her tragic death, Sandhya attended office and looked normal, but some of her friends privately said that she discussed with one of her colleges about the tough phase she was going through. "I spoke to her a day before she committed suicide, and I did not feel she was depressed. Even two days before the tragedy, Sandhya organised a Sufi night for an FM channel and was happy that day," Abdul Samad, another colleague, said.
 
 Her family members and friends described her as a fighter. "My sister can never commit suicide, I spoke to her around 1 pm in the afternoon and she was not at all depressed, even my younger sister spoke to Sandhya on the day of her death and the conversation was about food and nail polish,"  , the victim. "How can someone suddenly commit suicide," she rued.
