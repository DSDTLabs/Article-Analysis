NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the Centre’s decision to sack two senior naval officers --   and   -- for alleged involvement in the  .

 The officers were removed from service after a board of inquiry (BoI) held that they were involved in providing sensitive information regarding defence forces to outside agencies. The 2005 case involved leak of over 7,000 pages of   from the Navy War Room and the Air Headquarters, with a direct bearing on national security.
 
 The leak of sensitive information came to light in May 2005 when an officer was found in possession of an unauthorised pen drive containing secrets of defence forces. An informal inquiry was held and Rana and Jha were found to be likely conduits. An BoI was convened and it was held that the officers had become undesirable and their sacking was recommended. The Centre accepted the recommendation and dismissed them on October 26, 2005.
 
 The officers challenged the Centre’s decision before the Armed Forces Tribunal which dismissed their plea on June 30, 2010. They then approached the SC.
 
 A bench of Justices Dipak Misra, A M Khanwilkar and M M Shantanagoudar, however, found no merit in their petition and upheld the Centre’s decision.
 
 Advocate R Balasubramanian, appearing for the Centre, said the two officers used to provide sensitive information to unauthorised agencies and endangered the country’s security. He said Rana and Jha were arrested along with other officers involved in the case.
 
 Apart form Rana and Jha, former naval officer Kulbhushan Prashar, former IAF Wing Commander Sambha Jee L Surve and alleged arms dealer Abhishek Verma are facing trial in the case for criminal conspiracy under IPC and under various provisions of Official Secrets Act.
