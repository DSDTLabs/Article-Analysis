MAU:   Narendra Modi on Monday accused SP and BSP to be working on a plan to dent BJP's chances to return to power in Uttar Pradesh. 

 Addressing a rally in Mau in eastern Uttar Pradesh, PM Modi said both the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party know that they have not performed well in the four phases of polls in the state and have started playing games trying for a fractured mandate so that they can have bargaining power in the hung house. 
 
 "Ab dono ne khel khelna shuru kiya hai ki hum hare to hare, lekin kisi ko bahumat nahi milna chahiye (Both have started playing a game that even if we are defeated, no one should get a majority)," Modi said at an election rally at Sahroj village in Mau Sadar assembly constituency, which is the citadel of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari.
 
 While Mukhtar is contesting on a BSP ticket, BJP has spared this seat for alliance partner Suheldeo Bhartiya Samaj Party.
 
 "I want to tell the leaders of SP and BSP to try whatever means they can to defeat the BJP, there is no problem. But, do not play with the future of UP. It has already suffered a lot in the past," Modi said in his over hour-long speech. 
 
 "You (SP, BSP) might be thinking that in case of a hung House, you will get a chance to bargain. But people of UP ensured a full majority to BJP in Lok Sabha elections, and in these elections too they will ensure that BJP wins with a huge margin," PM Modi said at the rally in Mau.
