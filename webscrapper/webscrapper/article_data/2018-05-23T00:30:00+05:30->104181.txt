BENGALURU: Namma Bengaluru’s first Bicycle Mayor   will oversee promoting the use of cycles as a cheaper and cleaner mode of transportation.

The organisation has started this project in 11 countries and in India, it has been implemented in Guwahati and Indore.
 
 There were about 19 entries in Bengaluru for the post, and six persons were shortlisted after evaluation by a panel. Cycling enthusiast Sathya Shankaran will work closely with the government. He’ll try to ensure that more bicycles are brought onto the roads, thus reducing the gridlocks created by cars and two-wheelers. On Monday, Sathya was given the title by  , honorary consul general, The Netherlands.
 
 IPS officer  , an avid cyclist who participated in the event, said this initiative should be implemented not only in Bengaluru but also other cities of the state. “We chose Bengaluru because we believe this city is more welcoming of a new culture,” he said. He also briefed the media about plans to work with government, police and educational institutions. “The challenge is to make use this tradition and ensure that more people use cycles,” said urban expert  .
