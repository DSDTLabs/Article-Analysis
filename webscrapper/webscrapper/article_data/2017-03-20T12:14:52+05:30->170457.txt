RANCHI: The district administration has decided to introduce   on more than 1,300 petrol and electronic rickshaws and 70 buses in an effort to make   system safer, cleaner and user-friendly.

 Anyone can access details about the driver, the vehicle’s  , chassis number and the route of the rickshaw by scanning the code. Problems related to women’s safety and uncomfortable experiences in public transport will also be addressed through these QR codes. 
 
 Traffic SP Sanjay Ranjan Singh said, “It was difficult to find unregistered rickshaws earlier. It will be impossible to copy the QR code unlike the passes which were issued earlier. The commuters will be safe and registered rickshaws will be allowed to carry a limited number of passengers.”
 
 The upper limit for the eco-friendly electronic rickshaws will be 1,200, of which 900 have already been allotted through lottery, the SP said. In busy locations such as airport and railway stations, around 150 petrol auto-rickshaws will be allowed to ply. 
 
 The routes will be alloted to the registered rickshaws biannually through lottery system. In order to improve connectivity across the city, routes will be set for 13 to 14 kilometres from the entry points of the city, such as Sector-2 of HEC, Kantatoli, Namkum among others.
 
 Singh said, “The city will be divided into four zones and the routes within the city will be allotted to avoid any traffic congestion.”
 
 A biannual lottery will ensure the rickshaw drivers do not suffer financial losses due to sticking to just one route. Additionally, drivers will be allotted routes close to their residential addresses.
 
  has also decided to run 70 buses in the city, of which 25 have already been ordered. The buses will start operating in the high traffic zones next month.
