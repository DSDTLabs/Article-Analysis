Rajkot: Members of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) threw eggs on convoy of BJP national president Amit Shah near Keshod town of Junagadh on Monday midnight. Shah along with other BJP leaders was going towards Somnath ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit on Wednesday.

 According to sources, over a dozen PAAS members had gathered near Sondarda village about 5km from Keshod town on the bypass road. Shah, who had arrived at Rajkot airport on Monday evening was going by road to Somnath.
 
 When Shah’s convoy was passing through Sondarda village, PAAS member threw eggs at the vehicles. Though they were not sure if the any of the eggs hit Shah’s car, but this was their way of protesting against the ruling BJP in the state. Patidars across Gujarat are seeking reservation under OBC category. They had earlier created ruckus in Surat last year during a public meeting where Shah was to address. Shah was not allowed to speak and had to leave the programme with-in ten minutes.
