CHENNAI: Claiming that the construction sector is reeling due to  , the   unit of   (BAI) has sought the state government to take over the sale of river sand to improve revenue to the exchequer. 

 BAI Tamil Nadu and   secretary S Ayyanathan said the price of sand has also shot up. "While 200 cubic feet of river sand procured is from the sand queries at a rate of 650, private agencies sell it at an inflated price of 5000 to builders. Under such circumstances, the government must take over the task of selling sand directly to builders at a fixed price," he said. The public works department ( ) may facilitate the process of marketing sand by establishing stockyards, where consumers can purchase sand without the intervention of private players, he added. 
 
 He further said that the e-tender process must be extended for PWD and highways department tenders. On the issue of the high court vacating the stay on resale of unapproved plots, Ayyanathan said that the government should come out with the proposal for regularising such housing plots without any delay.
