BEIJING: On the first day of Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s tour of India, during which he will inaugurate the host country’s first Bullet Train, China began canvassing for the sale of its high-speed trains to India.

 “China is pleased to see the infrastructure cooperation among regional countries including on high-speed railway, and we stand ready to promote cooperation with India and other regional countries to promote regional development,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman   said on Wednesday .
 
 Japan and China are competing for contracts for high-speed railway business in India, though there are questions on whether India needs high or medium-speed trains to meet their economic returns. There are also issues about exorbitant costs involved, and the inability of ordinary passengers to afford expensive tickets.
 
 “As to railway cooperation, I can tell you it is part of practical cooperation between China and India,” Geng said. “...the relevant competent authorities between the two countries have maintained communication on promoting and increasing the speed of the railway in the current projects.”
 
 The Chinese foreign ministry said it was not able to immediately resume access of Indian pilgrims to the   route leading to Mansarovar, which was suspended after the border crisis in   area.
