NEW YORK: New York is hosting one of the biggest tributes to Sikh culture in America — a parade down   capped by a sea of turbans.

 The Saturday afternoon gathering of thousands of ethnic Sikhs is officially called a “meditation celebration.” But it’s mostly a boisterous walk to live music, with participants wearing the stylish, multi-colored clothing of their culture. On the sidelines of the annual event, vendors offer homemade Indian food.
 
 In New York, Sikhs are most visible in the borough of Queens. The Manhattan parade starts at 1 pm on Madison Avenue and East 26th Street and proceeds down to East 26th Street until 4 pm.
