He was at the peak of his career, when, following a stint in ' ', he suddenly quit acting. Now, four years later, Akashdeep Saigal, who changed his name to  , is back to doing what he does best — wreaking havoc in the protagonist’s life on TV shows. 

 The actor is returning to the studios with the historical show, 'Sher-E-Punjab: Maharaja Ranjit Singh', in which he will play the antagonist, Pir Muhammad. 
 What kept him away for so long? “I lost my mother. I was extremely attached to her and after her death, I lost interest in everything. It took me a while to bounce back, but when I returned, I took up projects down South. I have always been passionate about everything I do. Now that I am back, I will give more than 100 per cent to acting. I am more evolved, grateful and serious about my craft,” he replies.
 
 Now that he is more ‘evolved’, has he gotten rid of his temperamental avatar that we saw on 'Bigg Boss'? “Such shows tend to create drama inside the house because fights sell. People like voyeurism. There are lovely moments as well, but one can pack only so much in an hour’s telecast. The makers create an image for every contestant and show footages matching that. Having said that, I could have done better,” he explains.
 
 What about him accusing the host   of sabotaging his career? “That’s a thing of the past. I wish him all the best. People make mistakes. Time changes everything,” he says. On the personal front, Sky has been single ever since he broke up with his girlfriend of two years, Pooja Bedi. “She is a wonderful person; in fact, there were times when I would wonder if that was for real. She is the best person I have known. We were two strong personalities and hence, clashes were bound to happen,” he says, adding, “I may be single, but every man requires feminine energy to bring balance in life. My perception towards women has changed after my mom’s death.”
