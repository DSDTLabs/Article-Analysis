NEW DELHI: Hours before the Jat agitation was likely to start in the capital,   authorities caught a commuter trying to sneak in a countrymade   and two live rounds at Jasola Apollo   station on Sunday afternoon.

 Ramesh Kumar Das (42), a resident of Badarpur had allegedly come for an interview by bus, before he entered the Metro station. CISF authorities had been asked to maintain extra vigil because of the agitation which was to begin on Monday.
 
 The incident took place at the around 2:30 pm on Sunday, when the pistol in Das’s baggage was detected by the scanner. CISF officials asked Das to open his bag, and found a countrymade pistol and two live round.
 
 “The commuter had no satisfactory answer as to why his bag had the pistol and rounds. He was then taken to the station control room and   also carried out an interrogation,” said a senior CISF official.
 
 According to the CISF officials, he had come from Badarpur for an interview and had no idea how the pistol got in his bag. “The victim was unaware about the pistol and said someone may have put it in his bag during the journey,” the official said.
