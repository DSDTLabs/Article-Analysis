Kolkata: Bengal’s fish, chicken and egg prices may see an upward swing with truck drivers of southern states beginning a strike on Thursday demanding a cut in the third-party   premium that has been increased by 50%. The bulk of Bengal’s demand for fish, egg and chicken is met by the southern states. If the strike continues for a few more days, there will be a demand-supply mismatch triggering spike in prices.

  Nearly 60% of Bengal’s fish demand is met by Andhra Pradesh. “Trucks haven’t yet picked up fish. The impact of the strike on markets in Kolkata will be immediate,” said Mahinder Singh Gill, president of Federation of West Bengal Truck Operators Association.
 
 “Nearly 3.5 lakh trucks from Bengal are expected to take part in the strike. This is quite dangerous for our farmers. Those who already bore the brunt of demonetization, will now be hit hard if their perishable items rot in the field,” said Kamal Dey of Koley Market, one of the biggest wholesale markets here.
 
 The South India Motor Transport Association (SIMTA) called for the strike after a meeting in Chennai on March 11. Sources said differences with the   ( ) spurred SIMTA to announce the strike despite the fact that the all-India body had already called for a similar agitation from April 20, said Gill. As many as 2.75 lakh lorries, including one lakh medium goods vehicles, were parked along the roads Andhra Pradesh and   till the Odisha border on Thursday. Only 4,500 trucks and mini-lorries are operational for carrying essential commodities only.
