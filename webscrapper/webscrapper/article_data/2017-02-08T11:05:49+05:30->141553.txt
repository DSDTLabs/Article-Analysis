DEHRADUN: Worried about the future of KV FRI after it refuted to start admission process to Classes I and VI for the upcoming session due to “fund crunch”, alumni and parents of current students on Tuesday urged FRI director Dr   to intervene into the matter to find a long-term solution.
 
  Meanwhile, the All Uttarakhand Parents Association also wrote to the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD), seeking its intervention into the matter.
  
  Confirming her meeting with parents and alumni, Dr Savita told TOI, “I told them that we had discussed the matter in a recent meeting of the   that the decision to stop admission is not the solution. The issue can only be addressed if the KV FRI is transferred from the project sector category to the civil sector. We have already written to the   (KVS), and hope it will initiate requisite steps.”
  
  Deputy commissioner, KVS, Dehradun region,  , however, said he did not receive any such correspondence.
  
  It has been learnt that ICFRE has reduced funding allocation to 24% taking into consideration the number of outside students enrolled in the school, which being a project category school is primarily meant for children of FRI, ICFRE and sister organisations’ employees. Out of nearly 1,400 students enrolled in the school, employees children are just 389. Also, as per norms, there cannot be partial funding; either ICFRE will provide funding to it as project sector school, or if the school is shifted to the civil sector category, the funding will be done by KVS.
