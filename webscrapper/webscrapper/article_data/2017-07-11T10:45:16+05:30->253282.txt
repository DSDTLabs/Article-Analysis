NEW DELHI: Congress found itself tied in knots after first vehemently denying and then acknowledging that party vice-president   had met Chinese ambassador   amid the continuing stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops near the Sikkim-Tibet-Bhutan tri-junction.

 The controversy gained traction on social media over reports that the Chinese embassy first reported the meeting, saying it was to “exchange views on the current bilateral relations“, but deleting the post.
 
 The post seemed to have embarrassed Congress which denounced it as fake news. But with the controversy refusing to die down and reports of the meeting and the deletion by the Chinese embassy gaining traction, Congress finally confirmed the meeting. The party then struck a defiant stance in the face of sharp criticism by BJP with Rahul tweeting “it is my job to be informed on critical issues“ and “the government must explain why three ministers are availing Chinese hospitality“. The reference was to the visit of three ministers to China for BRICS-related engagements.
 
 In a series of tweets, Rahul said, “It is my job to be informed on critical issues. I met the Chinese ambassador, ex-NSA (Shivshankar Menon), Congress leaders from north-east and the Bhutanese ambassador.“ The expanded reference seemed aimed at countering the impression that he met only the Chinese ambassador during the ongoing crisis over China's attempt to build a road and take control of a part of Bhutanese territory .
 
 Rahul added, “If government is so concerned about me meeting an ambassador, they should explain why three ministers are availing Chinese hospitality while the border issue is on.“ As the controversy grew, Congress confirmed the engagement, arguing 'there's no need to sensationalise the meeting'.
