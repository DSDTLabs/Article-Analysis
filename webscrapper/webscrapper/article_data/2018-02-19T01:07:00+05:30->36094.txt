It is the Chathirapatti jallikattu, of Madurai, which introduced expensive prizes to the game, making it lucrative, bringing in more players. Despite the popularity, the event was never held after the Supreme Court ban, and though the ban was lifted later, the organizer had faced some difficulty in resuming their favourite game. Though Alanganallur game has been held on every Jan 26, the organisers had to be reschedule it to Sunday for failing to obtain the permission for the day.  In all, 832 bulls out of the 900 were given tokens for screening while 754 bulls entered the arena. Challenging them were 550 bull tamers. The event began with special pooja on Sunday morning, with the Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao and Madurai East MLA P Moorthy presiding over. Actor Udayanidhi Stalin was among the chief guests. The village temple bulls were unleashed first and then the game bulls entered the arena. Tamers were divided into groups and allowed into the arena. All of them had an eye on the most expensive prizes which included a car for the winning bull and a motorcycle for the best tamer. The best bull tamer was Vijikumar of Mangalakudi, who tamed 17 bulls, followed by Thavasi of Sholavandan taming eight and Muniraj of Kalanai, seven. Tight security arrangements were made at the venue under the guidance of Madurai District SP N Manivannan. No major injuries were sustained by the animals or men.
