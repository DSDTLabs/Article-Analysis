NEW DELHI: If you’ve always fancied the thought of rowing down the   to get a glimpse of the Buda Castle by night, or if shopping in the fashion districts of Milan is more the kind of holiday you enjoy, the summer of 2018 may yet be your best chance. 

 
 A trip to the most sought after European destinations may have once seemed out of reach for those looking for pocket-friendly holidays, but this summer, it seems, has thrown up nifty bargains. 
 
 A survey conducted by travel website Kayak.com between October 2017 and March 23, 2018, for summer travel between May 1 and August 1 this year claims most travel destinations in Europe and the neighbouring regions have seen price drops, making the idea of holidaying there more appealing, and leaving a smaller dent on the pocket. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 So, if your dream is to roam the labrynthine streets of the Grand Bazaar by afternoon, and watch the whirling dervishes of Istanbul dance by night, prices are 44% less than 2017 return flight and five days of hotel stay included. 
 
 The Kayak survey also claims holidays in Milan, Brussels and Prague are cheaper by nearly 25% in comparison to last year, while trips to Madrid, Berlin and Munisch are cheaper by nearly 20%. Budapest, the survey says, is cheaper by 17%, while   and Rome by nearly 13% and 10%, respectively. 
 
 The devil, as they say, though, is in the details and early planning is key to landing steal deals. The Kayak survey suggests Indians are more keen to travel to European destinations this year, with Moscow and Istanbul among the most sought after. 
 
 Holiday trends suggest Indians not only want the well-known European destinations on their itinerary but also want to tread the roads less taken — Norway, Hungary and even Iceland.
