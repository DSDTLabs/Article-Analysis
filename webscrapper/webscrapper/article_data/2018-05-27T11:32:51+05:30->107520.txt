 Asked how he enjoys balancing family life with show business, the father of three said, "It's all weird, dude. I grew up in government assisted housing in Toronto, so all of this is bizarre and fun."
 
 "This is the happiest time of my life. I have a lot of stuff coming and I think I may have found the right balance now and I'm super thrilled," he added.
 
 Myers, who has been largely absent from the big screen since making a brief appearance in 2009's  , added that he's spent his time away from the spotlight focusing on being a father to Spike, 6, Sunday, 4, and Paulina, 2.
