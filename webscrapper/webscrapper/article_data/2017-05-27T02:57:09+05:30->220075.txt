New Delhi: Defying its earlier stance, the   corporation has finally re-engaged 66 contractual ANM   who were earlier removed as regular employees filled their posts.

 The move comes despite the earlier court ruling that the   has no obligation to such contractual employees. Officials in the corporation argue that “the populist move will create in next one year an additional burden of around Rs 2.4 crore on the civic body which is already reeling under financial crisis unable to pay the salaries of its employees.” 
 
  Mayor of north Delhi Preeti Aggarwal said that NDMC took a decision in their favour as they served the corporation almost for 18 years and DSSSB had not made any regular appointment to the posts.tnn
