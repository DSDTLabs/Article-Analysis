LUCKNOW: Upholding decision of a   to set aside selection process of 4,000 sub-inspectors (civil police) and   right from the stage of announcing the main written examination, a   of the   said on Thursday the decision of the single judge did not call for any intervention. 

 Dismissing several special appeals by successful candidates and state government, the division bench upheld findings of the single judge. The division bench stressed selection was found dubious on various counts such as calling candidates three times more than the number of vacancies for group discussion.
 
 The bench also found that rounded off marks were awarded in violation of rule 15(d) of the Service Rules, which resulted in permitting ineligible candidates to participate in the main written examination.
 
 In 2011, the state government began selection process for appointment of 3,698   in civil police and 312 platoon commanders. The process was complete on June 26, 2015. Later, some failed candidates challenged the selection process. 
 
 The single bench of justice Rajan Roy on August 24, 2105 quashed the selections and directed government to proceed afresh after declaring the main exam result as per observations in the verdict.
 
 Dissatisfied from the single judge verdict, several special appeals were filed but the division bench dismissed all the appeals. The division bench said, "The manner in which the selection in question has been conducted has been found in violation of statutory service rules and same cannot sustain as held by single judge."
