BENGALURU: On Wednesday, the   (BMRC) released its final alignment for extension of the Purple Line from Byapanahalli to Whitefield. The 15.5km-line which is dotted with 13 stations, apart from the one at  , is expected to unclog Whitefield and Mahadevapura roads.

 Initially, the BMRC had planned 14 stations but dropped the one proposed at Narayanapura. Work has already begun on the line. Construction also includes widening of roads from Mahadevapura to Whitefield. The BMRC has set a deadline of 27 months for contractors to build the line. The Kadugodi station also requires some land from the Kadugodi reserved forest area, for which the agency has sought permission from the forest department. The department is now waiting for approval from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change.
 
 
 
 
 The first map of the   alignment, released on Wednesday, didn't have the Whitefield station marked on it. However, the corporation said it hadn't dropped any station along the corridor.“No station has been dropped from the alignment. There was a printing error in the map released earlier,“ Pradeep Singh Kharola, MD, BMRC, told TOI.
 
 The first map showed the line terminating at Ujjwala Vidyalaya. However, within minutes of TOI checking with BMRC, the corporation uploaded the correct map which reflected the Whitefield station near Kadugodi police station.
