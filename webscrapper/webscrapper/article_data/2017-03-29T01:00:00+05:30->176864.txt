 walked the ramp for designer   at DT   and said it was one of the first shows for which she didn't have to rehearse. "I had so much fun walking the ramp as I could see the models dancing and having a good time on the ramp. I didn't even rehearse and I was not very conscious while walking."

  The Delhi-born actress-turned filmmaker has been part of fashion shows in the capital before. "It is always nostalgic coming back to Delhi and this show was special as I was walking for the cause of the girl child. I also met a few acid attack survivors here and interacted with them. I admire their strength and courage," she said.
