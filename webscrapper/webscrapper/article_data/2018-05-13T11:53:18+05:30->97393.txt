  A day after the central bureau of investigation told the Delhi high court that it is treating the disappearance of JNU student   as a case of a “missing person” and has not found any evidence against nine suspects in the case,  , Fatima Nafees, on Saturday told 
 , “My son has not gone away somewhere. He has been abducted and kept somewhere.”
 
  “Najeeb was assaulted before his disappearance. If he had left on his own, he would have returned home. How can someone manage on his own without valid identity cards which is needed for basic things like travel? I do not have faith in police and  , but I have full confidence that I will get justice from the judiciary,” she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. 
  
  Fatima,61, who returned to Badaun on Friday night after the court hearing in Delhi, said, “The court hearing was earlier slated for May 8, but it was postponed to Friday and I decided to stay in Delhi expecting some good news. However, my heart sank on Friday and it was one of my worst journeys back home because all are trying to protect the suspects. The entire nation stands with me as everyone knows that   was assaulted at the campus of Jawaharlal Nehru University. I came to know that Najeeb was assaulted four times before he was abducted. I am not going to give up till my son returns home.”
  
  Commenting on the probe agency announcing a reward of Rs 10 lakh to anyone providing leads to Najeeb, Fatima, who lives in Badaun, said, “Even crime branch had announced an award and if it would have helped, I would have sold my property to declare an award. Only a thorough probe will help us.”
  
  Najeeb, a student of JNU, disappeared in October 2016.
