NAVI MUMBAI: The civic body is developing a pilot project of creating professional teams to represent Navi Mumbai at state and national level competitions.   is possibly the first civic body in the state planning to   athletes.  ,   and   are the three games shortlisted as part of the project. 

 NMMC will sign up 40 players—kho kho and kabaddi teams will have 15   each whereas 10 players will be contracted for shootingball. Ten players each for kabaddi and kho kho and six for shootingball will be selected from athletes who have played at state, national and university level competitions. District-level athletes and freshers will have a chance at the remaining five spots each for kabaddi and kho kho and four spots in shootingball. 
 
 The players will be paid a monthly honorarium of Rs 15,000 apart from a budget for their kits and training. NMMC has appropriated an annual budget of Rs 1.80 crore for the scheme, which will be implemented from July. The scheme is currently only for male athletes.
 
 “Local athletes will be given preference during selection trails,” said Revappa Gurav, NMMC sports officer. 
 
 The civic sports and cultural department had envisaged this concept last year but its implementation was delayed due to administrative approval. “It’s an ideal concept to promote young talents who don’t have the finances or the training facilities,” said Valmiki Naik, a kho kho coach.
 
  The administration has shortlisted a ground in sector 6, Airoli. “We are in search of another training ground in Koparkhairane. Our stadium at CBD could be another practice ground, if required,” said Gurav. 
 
 Interested candidates can apply online at www.nmmc.gov.in till April 25. Players will sign contracts for 11 months, which would be extended on merit.
