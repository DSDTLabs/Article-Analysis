The JD(U) on Tuesday favoured simultaneous Lok Sabha and assembly elections in the country. State JD(U) president Bashishsth Narayan   said the party is prepared to face simultaneous assembly and Lok Sabha elections in the state in 2019 if all parties and Election Commission reach a consensus.
 
  Addressing a function in which several politicians joined JD(U), Singh said if a consensus arrived between political parties and the Election Commission to hold assembly elections in Bihar and general elections simultaneously in 2019, the JD(U) is prepared for it.
  
  Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former President Pranab Mukherjee have also talked in favour of simultaneous elections in the country in the past. Niti Aayog had also pitched for simultaneous elections from 2024 in one of its recent reports.
  
    minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, who was in Patna last week, had also talked about holding state and general elections simultaneously in order to avoid the politics of vote bank and augment development works.
  
  Addressing a Diwali Milan event organised by the BJP in New Delhi last year, Modi had said more than Rs 1,100 crore was spent on the Lok Sabha elections in 2009 and the amount surged to Rs 4,000 crore in 2014 general elections. He had opined that frequent elections affect work at government offices and educational institutions as more than one crore government employees, including teachers, join election duty.
  
  Meanwhile, the RJD has accused JD(U) of surrendering to BJP by favouring simultaneous elections. Chief spokesperson of RJD’s Bihar unit   said the JD(U) has supported simultaneous elections because it is afraid that BJP would dump it after winning the general elections in 2019.
  
  “The mandate was given for five years and now JD(U) is talking about mid-term election, which would hit the state exchequer. The statement made by JD(U) state president clearly indicates that the party has surrendered to BJP,” Yadav said.
