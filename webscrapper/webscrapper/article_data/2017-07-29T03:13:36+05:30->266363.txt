MUMBAI: The Esplanade court recently   the former chairman of a credit co-operative society and sentenced him to five years in jail for   a youth 11 years ago by promising him a bank job.

 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on   (60), the then chairman of Santh Savta Mali Path Sanstha. 
 
 In 2006, the youth approached the economic offences wing and complained that Dudhal had cheated them and several other job aspirants of Rs 1.2 lakh. “On learning that Dudhal could help him get a bank job, the complainant, accompanied by his uncle, went to his house and paid him Rs 40,000. Later, when Dudhal asked for more money, the complainant took a loan and gave in to his demand,” said a police officer.
 
 But when the youth did not get a job, he asked Dudhal to return his money. Dudhal instead gave him a certificate from his credit co-operative society stating that the money was deposited there. A few days later, when the youth approached him again, Dudhal renewed the certificate saying he would get interest when the deposit matured. 
 
 The youth told the police that he did not want interest on his money, but a job which Dudhal failed to provide. “There were over 10 such youths who had given money to Dudhal, but only one of them filed a case,” said the officer.
