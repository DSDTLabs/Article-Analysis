NEW DELHI:   are being used as tools of   in divorce and custody matters, the high court has lamented. It observed that vindictive lawsuits filed by estranged couples end up harming their children even as the number of divorce cases across all sections of society is increasing, resulting in the rise of bitter child custody battles.

 “Often innocent children are used as tools of vengeance by vindictive litigants. A perusal of Article 39 (e) & (f) of the Constitution of India would guide that of the various fundamental rights of a child, one valuable right is to get love and affection from both parents, right to quality of life, right to be cared and the right to develop a sense of belonging,” a bench of Justices Pradeep Nandrajog and Yogesh Khanna observed in a recent case.
 
 The bench said that the primary consideration to find out the best interest of the child would be ensuring benefit to the child getting to spend significant time with   to develop a meaningful relationship.
 
 The court observed this on a plea by a man who moved HC seeking visitation rights and interim custody of his daughter, who was staying with her mother. He had been refused visitation right after he remarried following divorce by mutual consent in 2010. Allowing the visitation rights to the man, the court in the instant case noted that the child, who lived with her father for three years, turned not only cold but positively hostile towards the father within six months of staying with mother.
 
 Directing the child to be sent for counselling, the court observed, “Regretfully, the judge of the family court has not pondered to find the reason for this sudden behavioural change in the child. Has the mother poisoned the mind of the child? An attempt ought to have been made to unravel the truth.”
