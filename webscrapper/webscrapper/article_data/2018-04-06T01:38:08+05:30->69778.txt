NEW DELHI:   Arun Jaitley is likely to undergo a   at   and is currently working from home in a “controlled environment” to avoid infections. Sources said a donor had been identified and a doctor from outside the institute may be roped in to assist in performing the procedure. The date and time of the transplant have not yet been confirmed. Jaitley said he was being treated for a kidney-related problem.

 “I am being treated for kidney-related problems and certain infections that I have contracted. I am, therefore, currently working from controlled environment at home. The future course of my treatment would be determined by the doctors treating me,” the minister tweeted on Thursday evening. The 65-year-old minister has undergone a series of tests to assess his suitability for a transplant.
 
 If everything goes as planned, the transplant surgery may be conducted over the weekend,” a source said on condition of anonymity
 
 Sources said Arun Jaitley, who is diabetic and had undergone weight-loss surgery to manage the condition three years ago, is currently on dialysis, which, in simple terms, means cleaning the blood of waste products.
 
 But dialysis is a temporary solution, which is why a transplant sometimes becomes necessary. It involves harvesting a kidney from a   (a person can survive on one functioning kidney) and transplanting it into the patient who has lost function in both kidneys.
 
 “A kidney transplant is quite common and our doctors do it regularly. It’s not a complicated procedure. There’s nothing to worry about,” said a doctor who did not want to be quoted by name.
