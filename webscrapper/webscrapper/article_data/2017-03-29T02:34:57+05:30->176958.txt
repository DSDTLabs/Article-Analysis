MUMBAI: A fire broke out in a 16th floor   in a highrise on Link Road in Borivli (W) on Tuesday afternoon.   rescued a teenaged girl trapped in the flat after directing a water hose from the terrace of the 18-storey Romell Empress Terrace into the flat to control the blaze. The fire brigade is verifying the cause of the blaze. 

 Police said Natasha Pereira (18), who is ailing from a chronic illness, was alone at home when the fire broke out. A gas cylinder explosion aggravated the situation. Neighbours, who heard her scream for help, alerted police and fire brigade and then rushed to her aid. 
 
 Fire engines faced difficulty reaching the building owing to vehicles parked haphazardly on the premises. “Local youths broke the windows of the parked vehicles, put them in neutral gear and pushed them aside to make way for the fire engines,” said local Shiv Sena activist Abhishek Ghosalkar.
 
 It is essential that traffic and parking in crowded areas are managed properly so that in case of an emergency, fire vehicles can reach in time. Apart from space to pass through, fire vehicles also need sufficient parking space around the building so that they can station themselves there and hydraulic ladders can be used to send the firemen to upper floors to douse the blaze.
