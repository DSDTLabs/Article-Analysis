Ludhiana: Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains on Thursday opposed charging of toll at Ladhowal toll plaza.

 Addressing the mediapersons, Bains said in spite of court orders not to charge any toll till further notice, the toll plaza operator was still charging toll in contempt of court. Bains also accused the officials of Ladhowal police station of inaction and deliberately trying to delay the compliance of court orders. The MLA also claimed that he has lodged a complaint with the police commissioner against the toll plaza operator and all the officials of Ladhowal police station.
 
 Bains said, “It is my humble appeal that no one should pay toll at Ladhowal toll plaza as a Kapurthala court has ordered that no toll should be charged until National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) removes all encroachments from this highway and makes this highway safer for the commuters as it has become a killer stretch.”
 
 Bains said, “Regardless of court orders, the toll plaza operator is fleecing people by charging toll and brow beating the commuters who oppose their move. Ladhowal police also seems to be hand in glove with the company as they are refusing to act against the company in spite of clear flouting of orders of the court.”
 
 “Today I filed a formal complaint against the company and the police officials with the commissioner of police. And if this gundagardi does not stop within 24 hours, our party will sit on a dharna at this toll plaza until our demands are met,” Bains said.
 
 Bains made the toll plaza officials return money to some of the commuters who paid the toll on Wednesday and Thursday.
