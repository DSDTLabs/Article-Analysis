Surat: Police raided country liquor breweries being operated from four islands in the middle of Tapi river of Katargam area of the city and recovered liquor making materials worth Rs13,210 on Saturday. 

 The islands were raided by 10 policemen in two rubber boats belonging to the fire brigade. The brewers managed to escape but the police seized 85 containers of 50 litre each of liquid used to brew country liquor from the spot. Police also seized 175kg jaggery, 5kg alum, containers and 10 litre country liquor worth Rs13,210 in the raid.
 
 The islands have been turned into a haven for illegal activities by locals living on the banks of Tapi as they know it will not be easy for police to reach the spot. It has been noticed that on many occasions anti-social elements also run gambling dens from makeshift huts on the islands. The offenders are able to escape from the islands because these places offer them good visibility to all sides. 
 
 “We had specific information about liquor brewing activity and hence raided the islands. We completely destroyed the set up to brew country liquor and will keep a close watch on these locations now,” said D H Gor, police inspector, Katargam police station.
