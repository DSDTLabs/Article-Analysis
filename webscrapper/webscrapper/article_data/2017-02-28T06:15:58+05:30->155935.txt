RANCHI: The on-going tussle between   (RMC) officials and   worsened on Monday with the mayor, along with several other  , staging a   infront of the  . 

  This came after officials turned up late for a special meeting convened by the mayor herself. Ward councillors, who were present at the meeting, asked officials whether the decisions taken in the meeting would be valid or not. To this, RMC officials responded saying they would decide only after the meeting. 
 
  The response angered the councillors and the mayor, who decided to lock the RMC gates and stage a dharna instead. 
 
  The tussle between the two partites has been going on for quite some time, as a result of which, the RMC board meeting has not been conducted for over four months now. 
 
  Municipal commissioner Prashant Kumar said, "The mayor had asked us to convene a board meeting on February 14 but we requested her to postpone it due to the investors' summit . So the next meeting date was scheduled for today (February 27)." 
 
  However, when the agenda was sent to the mayor for approval, she returned the file after striking out several points from it. As a result, the board meeting was never finalised. The mayor called for a special meeting by herself, Prashant added. 
 
  "She is not empowered to strike down the agenda of the board meeting. The agenda is decided by the office and approved by the board, the mayor can only fix the date and time for the meeting," Prashant said. 
 
  Following this, an office order was issued by the commissioner, quoting the Jharkhand Municipality Act, which specified the area of functioning of the mayor. The office order rejected all claims and allegations of the mayor, following which the ward councillors later backed out from the protest. 
 
  However, the mayor claimed that RMC officials are working against her since tried to uncover the prevalent corruption in the office.
