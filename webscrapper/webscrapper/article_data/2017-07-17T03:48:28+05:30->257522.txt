MUMBAI: A few departments and sections of civic-run   in   reeled under power failure for over 40 hours, said doctors on Sunday evening. But there was some ambiguity on  . While senior officials maintained that power supply was restored around 5pm, a doctor said electricity had not yet been restored to a few departments, including radiology and imaging. “X-ray machines cannot be used, making this facility unavailable for patients,” said another doctor.

 The hospital plunged into darkness around 7pm Friday due to a shortcircuit caused by rainwater seepage, resulting in cancellation of surgeries and some out-patient departments. The ICU was managed with generator support, but patients in general wards were inconvenienced. “As it was Sunday, engineers were not available for repair work. We will know on Monday if surgeries continue to be cancelled,” said the doctor.
 
 But Dr  , chief medical superintendent of BMC’s suburban hospitals, said, “The problem was severe and required professionals to fix it. It has been fixed and electricity fully restored.”
