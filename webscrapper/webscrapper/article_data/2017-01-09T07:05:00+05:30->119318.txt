AMRITSAR: Union finance minister   reached Amritsar on Sunday to participate in a BJP rally that was organized to mark the end of its ‘Vijay Sankalp Rath Yatra’. 

 The BJP’s eight-day yatra crossed several assembly constituencies in the state to appeal to voters to vote for the SAD-BJP alliance in the upcoming assembly elections. “The yatra has culminated today, but SAD-BJP’s yatra to form a government in the state for the third time in a row has begun today,” he said.
 
 Listing out the achievements of the NDA government at the Centre, Jaitley claimed that PM Narendra Modi’s decisions had made the country proud. “By conducting surgical strikes across the LoC, PM Modi did what previous governments failed to do,” he said. “We carried out an attack on 70 years of corruption with demonetisation.” 
 
 Union minister and BJP’s Punjab party affairs in charge, Narendra Tomar, said the party would seek votes on the plank of development. On AAP national convener and Delhi chief minister  , Tomar asked party workers to ensure that the security deposits of all AAP candidates were forfeited. “Kejriwal’s magic has come to an end. He fooled the people of Delhi and shattered their dreams. He set a new low in politics. The people of Punjab won’t fall in his trap,” Tomar said.
 
 BJP Punjab president   said the yatra’s main objective was to ensure that party workers and leaders made a firm resolve to bring the coalition back to power. The yatra had started from Hussainiwala on December 29, and crossed 23 assembly constituencies from where the BJP is going to fielded its candidates.
