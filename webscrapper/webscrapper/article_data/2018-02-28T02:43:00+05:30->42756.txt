Guntur: Government General Hospital (GGH), Guntur, is virtually flooded with patients complaining about joint-related ailments pains and complicated orthopaedics cases.

 A few years ago, the orthopaedic wing mostly dealt with emergency surgeries. Now, the department is packed with out-patients (OP). The department doctors are screening almost 300 to 350 patients every day in the OP wing. “Patient number is clearly on the rise in the last two years. Obesity among all age brackets is taking a toll on the bone-strength,” said a senior professor at the government hospital.
 
 Yoga trainer N Ramesh Babu observed that lack of physical activity particularly among the youths is going to have serious consequences on their health in the future. 
 
 “Although, yoga and fitness centres are attracting good number of young people, their urge to eat western foods is taking away the benefit of physical exercise,” said Ramesh.
 
 A physician and social activist Dr Seva Kumar said the government’s failure to provide potable drinking water in fluoride-hit areas is also a major reason for growing number of orthopaedic complains. He said thousands of people including children are suffering with knee joint pains due to consumption of high-fluoride water. According to the data available with GGH authorities, at least 50 per cent of the total out-patients are being advised for long-term treatment to cure the ailment.
