NEW DELHI: For decades,   near India Gate has been popular with Delhiites for catching a luxury bus to Jaipur or Ajmer. From May 1, however, commuters would have to visit the Sarai Kale Khan Inter-State Bus Terminus to take a bus to these destinations.

 Not just Bikaner House in Lutyens’ Delhi, Chander Lok building and Himachal Bhawan in  , which offer similar bus services to destinations such as Shimla, Manali, Haridwar and Dehradun, would also witness shifting of operations to Sarai Kale Khan.
 
 Bus operators have been asked by the Delhi government’s transport department to shift operations following a   order. 
 
 On March 30, the apex court had directed the   State Roadways Transport Corporation (RSRTC) to stop plying   from Bikaner House near India Gate from May 1, citing pollution as the reason.
 
 “RSRTC has been given directions by the Supreme Court and we have also asked operators of Himachal Bhawan and Chander Lok building to shift their operations to Sarai Kale Khan from May 1,” said a transport department official. The official said that proper slots would be made available for these buses at  .
 
 “In case the operators fail to comply with the orders, our enforcement wing would impound their buses if found plying from these locations,” he said. Nearly 30 buses operate from Bikaner House every day while about 10 buses operate from Himachal Bhawan.
