GURGAON: After acting against illegal colonies, enforcement wing of department of town and country planning (DTCP), is going to tighten the noose around encroachers who had developed   from next week. For the first time,   has decided to issue notices to these colonisers to recover the amount spent by the department in the   drive.

 From 2008 to 2012, DTCP acted against 110 illegal colonies in Sohna, Gurgaon, Pataudi and  , and now claims to have identified the colonisers behind their development. An amount of Rs 25,000 per acre will be recovered from each coloniser, for which notices will be issued by next week.
 
 According to the Haryana government, Gurgaon has been declared as controlled area, under which it is mandatory to take permission for change of land use (CLU) from DTCP in order to carry out construction on agricultural land. If anyone raises a structure without the CLU, the department can demolish it and take action against land owners.
 
 Recently, director of town and country planning had issued an order directing the department to prepare a list of demolitions carried out by them from 2008 to 2012.
 
 “We have fixed an amount of Rs 25,000 per acre for recovery from colonisers. The amount was calculated after including the cost of man power and machinery used in demolition process,” said assistant town planner (ATP)  . According to the rule, he said, the department has the power to recover the cost of demolition from the coloniser, but it wasn’t applied till now.
 
 District town planner (enforcement)   said this will be the first time when they will recover the cost of demolition from the coloniser. “It will act as a deterrent and will give strong message to illegal colonisers,” said Sharma. 
 
 After issuing notices for the period of 2008-2012, DTCP will prepare another list of demolitions carried out after 2012.
