BAREILLY: Minister of state of social welfare and SC/ST department  , who used the term ‘Harijan’ for Dalits, had to leave the stage at an Ambedkar birth anniversary event in   on Saturday as miffed audience and organisers refused to be calmed.

 The term ‘Harijan’, popularized by Mahatma Gandhi, has been considered condescending by many, including BR Ambedkar himself, who objected to its use.
 
 The minister hails from one of the scheduled castes.
 
 When asked about the incident, the minister told TOI, “Some people at the event started creating a ruckus as soon as I uttered the word ‘Harijan’. I had to clarify that I am also the daughter of a  . I said nothing unconstitutional or objectionable.”
 
 Notably, the Centre last month had asked all ministries, departments and state governments to avoid using the words ‘Dalit’ and ‘Harijan’ when referring to people belonging to scheduled caste communities.
 
 In a letter sent to all state governments and Union Territories, the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment had asked to use ‘scheduled caste’ and its translation in other languages for official communication.
 
 Asked if she had to leave the place without completing her speech, Gulab Devi said, “I was asked by the organisers to wind up my speech in two minutes; though I was allotted over five minutes.”
