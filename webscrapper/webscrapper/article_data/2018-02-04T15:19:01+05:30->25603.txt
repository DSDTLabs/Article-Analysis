Singh claimed that the cabinet expansion has been done for political reasons, while the character of the BJP that speaks so often on culture and tradition, has been exposed. Singh said that MLA from Narsinghpur seat Jalim Singh Patel, who was sworn-in as minister of state, was absconding on police records till five months ago. “The chief minister has traced him and made him a minister,” he added.

 “Chief minister   made governor Anandiben Patel to administer oath to a tainted man. Similarly, Narayan Singh Kushwah, who was administered oath as a cabinet minister, has a son-in-law who is accused in a Rs 1000-crore chit fund scam and is presently in jail,” the LoP said. He added that minister of state   is accused in a murder case. “As minister Lal Singh Arya was absconding, but the chief minister protected him and thereafter started a new chapter in the political history of  ,” Singh said.
