MUMBAI: A senior executive pilot of   has landed in the dock for not having undergone the mandatory   before operating flights in the past few days.

 On Monday, Air India's pilot union body, the   (ICPA), sent a written complaint to the Indian aviation regulator, the  , raising concerns about flight safety.
 
 “It has been brought to our notice that one of the Air India executive directors who is a pilot has been evading pre-flight medicals endangering the safety of innocent flying passengers and crew members,” said the ICPA letter urging the DGCA to investigate the matter by procuring pre-flight medical records and CCTV footages for the fortnight. The ICPA letter contended that since action has been taken against pilots who had genuinely forgotten to do post flight breath analyser test, more stringent action should be taken in this case. 
 
 The Air India spokesperson did not comment on the matter. Sources from the airline said that a four-member committee has been constituted to investigate the matter. A pre-flight medical, which includes a breathalyser test to detect alcohol in blood, is mandatory for pilots before operating flights.
