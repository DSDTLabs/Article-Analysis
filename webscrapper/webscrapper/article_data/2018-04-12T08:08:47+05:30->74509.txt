CHENNAI:   has ended fiscal 2017-18 with a clean sweep of the top five selling passenger vehicle models in India. The company’s Alto has topped the all-India sales tally for the fiscal with 2.5 lakh units, followed by   (2.4 lakh), Baleno (1.9 lakh), Swift (1.7 lakh) and   (1.68 lakh).

 
 While Maruti’s dominance in top-10 best-selling models list is not new, this year the difference between sales numbers of the mass market entry-level Alto and compact sedan Dzire has come down from more than 40,000 units in FY16-17 to a mere 18,415 units. While Alto, too, has grown by 7%, the reason for the reduction in sales gap is due to Dzire’s much higher growth at 20%. Indeed, the only model that did not grow in the top-5 list is Maruti’s WagonR, which saw sales dipping from 1.72 lakh units in FY16-17 to 1.68 lakh this time round.
 
  
  
 
 A look at the sales tally comparison between FY16-17 and FY17-18 tells the story:   Suzuki clocked the highest growth in the top-5 list in the Baleno, which grew a staggering 58% year-on-year. The second-highest growth was in Dzire sales. In comparison, older models like Swift and Alto showed modest growth. While Swift grew 5.4%, WagonR contracted 2%. 
 
 Maruti also has two more models in the top-10 list — Vitara Brezza at No. 7 and Celerio at No. 10. While Vitara Brezza sales grew nearly 37% to 1.5 lakh units, Celerio sales actually contracted by almost 3% to 94,721 units.
 
 The growth patterns show the trend: Although entry segment is growing on back of Alto’s popularity, the spurt is lower than what’s being totted up by SUV and sedan brigade. Even a not-so-new Dzire has clocked a significant double-digit growth rate, showing rising preference for ‘bigger’ vehicles. Clearly, India still loves the hatch, but is beginning to aspire for other vehicle types like sedans and SUVs.
 
 A dealer said, “That should explain why WagonR sales showed a decline and Swift growth was just over 5%, alongside the fact that these are relatively older models. Even the newish Celerio has seen growth contract from 97,361 units in FY16-17 to 94,721 units in FY17-18.”
