NAGPUR:   kick-started his third tournament of the Catalan   Circuit with a comfortable victory at Badalona, Spain, on Friday.

 The 50-year-old started his campaign in the XIX Sant Marti International Open chess tournament with the black pieces against one of the oldest participant and 65-year-old Monedero Gonzalez Josep of Spain. City’s only International Master (IM) posted victory in 40 moves.
 
 The nine-day standard format of the international chess tournament has attracted 161 players from 31 countries include 34 Indian masters. Of the 161 participants, as many as 78 title holders - 12 Grandmasters (GM), 27 IMs, 18 Fide Masters (FM) and 21 Chess Masters - are vying for honours.
 
 The 54th board battle between the two oldest participants saw the younger one winning the contest with ease. Playing with the white pieces Monedero started with the Reti opening while the 55th seed Deshmukh played logical and simple moves to emerge victorious.
 
 “It was an easy start for me against Monedero. I think he is the oldest player of this tournament. From the white side he played Reti opening very well and till the 17th move the position remained equal,” Deshmukh told TOI from Spain.
 
 He added, “I kept on replying him with simple moves, almost natural. In the mid-game, I started in increased the pace of the game by playing fast and on the 24th move he committed a mistake. May be at this age he felt short of ideas as he missed a move.”
 
 “After missing a crucial move he started coming under time pressure. I then sacrificed an exchange for my attack on his king side. And I had many compensation for the material and easily won the game in 40 moves,” the LIC employee said.
 
 In the second round on Saturday, Deshmukh will open with the white pieces and will face the challenge of 7th seed and a much higher rated GM   of Russia on the 5th board.
