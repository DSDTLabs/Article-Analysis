Named ‘Corneal Implants’ the hospital claims that it can treat keratitis - inflammation of the cornea caused by both bacterial and fungal damages.

 Regional medical director of Dr Agarwal Eye Hospital, Tirunelveli, Lional Raj D whose team has come out with the technique told reporters here on Thursday that keratitis could lead to blindness. “It is estimated that about 30% of keratitis cases in India lead to blindness,” he said.
 
 According to him, the present available measure to treat infectious corneal diseases is by fortified antibiotic eye drops that requires frequent administration. “But bio availability of antibiotics in the deeper corneal tissues is limited due to poor penetration of drugs by eye drops,” Raj said.

Duration of the treatment ranges from two to three months as it varies for every individual. Total cost of treatment ranges from Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000.
