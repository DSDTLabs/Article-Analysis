AHMEDABAD: The state government now plans to forward proposed changes to eco-sensitive zones around  , as objections received by locals in the area. The   committee of the Union ministry of environment and forests will thus have to take these objections into consideration.

 “These proposal for reductions will be sent to the ESZ committee of the Union ministry of environment and forest as objections raised by local people and the committee will have to accept these,” said an officer in the forest department. He further pointed out that in many cases, the government was taking refuge in the fact that ESZs for sanctuaries were larger than the sanctuaries themselves, the reduction was thus sought. For example, the area of Gir Sanctuary and National Park is 1,469.99 sq km, while the ESZ is 3,328.8139 sq km.
 
 A minister and committee member of the ministers’ committee, on condition of anonymity, said, “There are a lot of political considerations to reduce the size of ESZs. The main reason is the local political representation, as ESZs directly affect development in the region. There are regions where the government will compromise the interests of   for development. We will submit our report to CM   and it will be sent to the government of India for final clearance.”
 
 Ganpat Vasava, forests and environment minister said: “We have received several complaints from locals that their fields and land are affected because of the ESZ. For approvals to even construct a fence, the farmer will have to come to the department.
 
  The farmers and locals made representations after which the department decided to revise the proposals. We will send the proposal, but the committee of the ministry will take a final call. We have reduced the ESZ in almost all sanctuaries, as there was a hue and cry in the area.”
