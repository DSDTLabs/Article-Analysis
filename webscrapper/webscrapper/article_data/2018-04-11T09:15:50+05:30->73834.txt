NEW DELHI: India is the world’s second largest importer of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) after China and remains ahead of Japan as the Modi government’s drive to provide clean cooking fuel to millions of poor families expanded household demand by nearly 8% in 2017-18. India beat Japan in 2016 to become the world’s third-largest consumer of crude oil after the US and China. 

 Both International Energy Agency and Opec see India as the main driver of growth in global oil demand for the coming decade as an expanding middle class drives auto sales and “energy justice” for the poor pushes up fuel consumption. Government data indicates India’s import of LPG topping 11 million tonnes in 2017-18 on the back of household consumption expanding nearly 8% as Ujjwala — one of the Modi government’s flagship social programmes — adds volume to overall demand. 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 Only recently, international media reports quoting shipping data pegged India’s LPG import at 2.4 million tonnes in December, exceeding China’s 2.3 million tonnes for the first time. But India still trails China’s average monthly import of 2.7 million with 1.7 million tonnes of its own. 
 
 While a monthly import spike may be caused by a variety of factors, signs of consumption growth are, nevertheless, all there. Not surprising then that the rapid progress of Ujjwala under oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan’s watch is estimated to push up household demand for LPG to more than 27 million tonnes by 2022, up from more than 18 million tonnes. 
 
 The PM may flag the success of Ujjwala to emphasise the potential of India’s energy market and need for an equitable global pricing regime when he addresses policymakers and oil industry captains at the 16th International Energy Forum ministerial in New Delhi on Wednesday.
