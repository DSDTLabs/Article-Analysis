CHENNAI: A three judge bench of the Madras   on Friday directed the authorities to implement removal of Prosopis juliflora ( ) in a phased manner.

 Noting that the process will be started from the water bodies, the bench said, “Authorities with the help of experts shall identify the areas where removal process should be mechanical and where it should be manual. Appropriate land management standards shall also be designed to control the spread of the trees wherever required.”
 
 It added that a programme shall be evolved for planting alternative spices on the land cleared.
