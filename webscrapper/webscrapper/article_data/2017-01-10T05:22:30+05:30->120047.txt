MUMBAI: If you boarded a flight or landed at the   in December, then you may have been among those flyers whose flight was delayed. The flight schedule punctuality was at its worst last month with nearly 45% arrivals and departures being delayed by over 15 minutes. 

 Last year, the best on-time performance was recorded in February with only 25% departures/arrivals being delayed. On average, about 25-30% flights get delayed every month at the airport. But since September, the number of delayed arrivals and departures at Mumbai airport has been on a steady rise.
 
 The punctuality record for December plummeted as 50% of Indigo's and  's departure flights were delayed. In December, Indigo operated a total of 2,738 departure flights, out of which 1,363 were delayed. AI, on the other hand, operated 1,330 departure flights, out of which 670 were delayed. But IndiGo fared better in arrivals with only 1,038 of the 2,732 (38%) flights delayed, making it the second best in terms of on-time performance for arrivals. Jet had the best on-time performance for departures, only 38% delayed;   had the best for arrivals, with only 34% departures delayed.
 
 Data by flightstats, a global flight tracker, put AI as the third worst international airline in the world in terms of on-time performance. Israel's El Al was the second worst and   took the top slot for worst punctuality. Air India, in a statement, said it totally disagreed with the report. "Initially, it seems the report is fabricated. The AI management will investigate the report," said a spokesperson.
