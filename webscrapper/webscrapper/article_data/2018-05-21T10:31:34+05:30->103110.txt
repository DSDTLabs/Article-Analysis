BENGALURU: The Congress-JD(S) coalition government is likely to have two deputy chief ministers, with Lingayat MLAs stepping up pressure on both alliance partners that one of the posts be given to the community. There are 16 Lingayat MLAs in the  , the highest from any community among the party's 78 MLAs. The JD(S) has four Lingayat MLAs.

 
 The Congress, according to sources, has already decided to provide the deputy CM post to a Dalit and   president   is likely to be the choice in recognition of his service to the party as the longest serving KPCC president.
 
 Now that the   have put forth their demand for the deputy CM post, the Congress is likely to oblige them to get rid of the anti-Lingayat tag it had earned post   government's efforts to divide the community.
 
 "It could be either Shamanur Shivashankarappa or MB Patil who will become the deputy CM in case the party decides to have two deputies to Kumaraswamy," said a Congress MLA from North Karnataka.
