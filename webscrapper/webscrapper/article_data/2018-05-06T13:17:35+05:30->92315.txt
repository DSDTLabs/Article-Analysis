AHMEDABAD: As part of the ongoing drive against bootleggers, city police and municipal authorities demolished illegal property belonging to another bootlegger, on the second consecutive day on Saturday. A property owned by a listed bootlegger, Anil alias Bhuriyo, was demolished in Sardarnagar on Saturday under heavy police bandobast.

 On Friday, property of an alleged woman bootlegger   of Chharanagar was demolished in the morning. Police said the property was illegal as it was built from money earned from selling illegal liquor.
 
 Additional commissioner of police, sector-2, Ashok Yadav, said that the first phase of the demolition drive is now over. “We have a list of 50 such bootleggers who own illegal properties built from proceeds of selling and trafficking of liquor. We are working in tandem with AMC officials. The bootleggers will be given a chance to put forward their version. The second phase of demolition will start within two months,” said Yadav.
 
 “Perhaps, this is the first incident across the country in which cops along with municipal authorities are taking steps together to demolish illegal properties belonging to bootleggers,” added Yadav.
 
 “On Thursday, state police chief DGP   had directed senior cops to directly supervise liquor seizures over the value of Rs 20 lakh and probe links of the bootleggers to organized crime and forgery so that the ED can impose Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against them. The decision to demolish illegal properties belonging to bootleggers was taken after that,” Yadav said.

Police have registered a case against some unknown persons. According to police, details are being verified to find out whether the man was beaten up by bootleggers or not.
