NAGPUR: The Maharashtra government, on Thursday, informed that just over 17,000 students were found ineligible for distributing scholarships, out of the 16.88 lakh forms received in academic year 2015-16.

 The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court then directed it to ensure disbursement of payment of scholarship and freeship to the eligible students on time. The court had taken suo motu cognisance of media reports that many students were devoid of scholarship amount after government stopped distributing it due to massive scholarship scam worth crores. 
 
 TOI first exposed the massive scholarship scam on August 10, 2014. The   and   departments had allegedly distributed a staggering amount of Rs4.34 crore to 2,815 students from 63/250 banned colleges of  , ignoring the fact that the students were not enrolled by NU for over a year.
 
 Earlier, an affidavit by the government stated that it issued a resolution on January 11, 2010, for distributing the scholarship amount through the core banking. “It appears that taking into consideration the huge scam, the government has now taken a decision to credit the amount and freeship directly in the account of the eligible students. It could thus be seen that more than 90% of the students have already been granted benefit under the scheme,” a division bench comprising justices   and Indira Jain observed. 
 
 The judges noted that the government had directed mapping of all entire colleges, and recognition of courses and the colleges, by the relevant authorities at the level of regional deputy commissioner of every division. “It appears that in 2016, the time took on account of the process of mapping. However, it is stated that since now the online mapping is completed, the government would not be required to undergo through same process for academic year 2016-2017. We do hope that for the present academic year there will be no necessity for mapping,” the judges stated. 
 
 The government in its detail reply earlier, informed about various steps taken by it in this regard. It stated that for the academic year 2015-16, about 16,88,075 forms were received from entire state. After scrutiny, about 15,03,072 cases were approved, while 1,10,828 are pending at the college level and 56,897 at the district level. 
 
 Before disposing of the plea, the court appreciated efforts taken by the amicus curiae   in assisting it in such an important matter.
