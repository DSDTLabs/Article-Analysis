MUNGER: An irate   led by Harinmar panchayat sarpanch Pramila Devi attacked the local police station and forcibly freed the sarpanch’s son, Rajesh Kumar, from police custody on Tuesday evening.

 The mob also resorted to stone pelting and damaged the boundary wall of the police station. Harinmar police station SHO Mukesh Kumar said one of the security guards Sardar Sukhbir Singh deputed at the police station was injured in stone pelting.
 
 The srapanch’s son was taken to the police station for allegedly making a village youth Rajhans Kumar captive after he failed to pay a fine of Rs 70,000 on the diktats of the village panchayat. The fine was imposed on Rajhans for allegedly having an illicit relation with a woman from Athsayya village under Harinmar panchayat.
 
 On getting information about the captivity, police reached the village and took Rajesh into custody and brought him to the police station for interrogation.
 
 Soon additional police force was deployed at the police station and the irate mob dispersed. Later, police also rescued Rajhans from the village, who was later handed over to his parents.
 
 An FIR has been lodged against 26 named person including the village sarpanch, her son Rajesh and over 100 unknown persons for attacking the police station, said the SHO. 
 
 Munger SP Ashish Bharti said, “ Strict action will be taken against the wrongdoers. However, the sarpanch and her son are absconding.”
