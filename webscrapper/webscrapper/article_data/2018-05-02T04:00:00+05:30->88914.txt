He used to sell saris to buyers on road, the police found during investigation. Chandiwala calculated the stock and found that 132 saris were missing.

The entire incident was shot on mobile phone and the video later went viral on the social media. On coming to know, the police traced Shaikh and questioned him about the incident. Later, Shaikh lodged a complaint with the police. “The shop owner did not register police complaint of theft earlier and based on CCTV footage had nabbed Shaikh and thrashed him. Investigation in the matter is on,” the police said.
