CHANDIGARH:   CM   said the state government would, if needed, form a fresh committee to amend syllabus in view of a row erupting over new history books being published by the   (PSEB) for classes XI and XII.

 
 Speaking at a function in Chandigarh, Amarinder said he would take a relook into the committee set up by the previous SAD-BJP government to revise and rewrite history books.
 
 The chief minister, however, said errors, if any, in history syllabus could be attributed to the experts’ committee set up by the previous government to review the syllabus so as to align it with   syllabus. He said action would be taken if any errors were found in history syllabus. “This also includes the setting up of a fresh panel to reexamine history books,” he added.
