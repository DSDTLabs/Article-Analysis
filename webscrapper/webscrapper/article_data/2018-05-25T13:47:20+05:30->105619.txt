TRICHY: Even though the state government abolished the ranking system last year, students continue to feel the pressure of scoring high marks.

 Out of the 10,000 odd calls received by 104 health advice helpline services operated by   (Emergency Management and Research Institute), a majority came after the Class XII and X results were out this year from students in distress over not scoring high marks.
 
 “There is always a hype over Class XII performance as it helps secure admission in the desired colleges, but students of Class X are the most vulnerable. Apart from the pressure of facing the board exam for the first time, the fact that only high scores could get them their desired streams keep them under pressure,” said officials from 104 health advice helpline services.
 
 Many of the students had called and asked the officials to talk to their parents, who constantly pressure children for high marks. 
 
 A majority of parents were still unable to think beyond engineering and medicine with the result that the children struggled to cope up with the pressure, they said.
 
 A 16-year-old girl from   committed suicide dejected over scoring less than the desired marks in SSLC exam. The girl was alone at home on Wednesday when the results were declared. 
 
 A very bright student, she was expecting over 480 marks out of 500. However she was disappointed to learn that she scored only 446 marks. 
 
 Similarly, four students near   in   district attempted suicide after getting low scores in Class X examinations. 
 
 With question papers slightly difficult than previous years and schools and education department hinting that the evaluation process will not be liberal, a slip in results was expected by many.
