BENGALURU: The Karnataka high court on Thursday ordered notice to the Press Council of India (PCI) and the regulatory body for private TV channels in a petition filed by   B S  . The former chief minister is seeking a restraint order against chief minister Siddaramaiah, other Congress leaders and the media from referring to him as a “jailed” politician.

 “This court is of the opinion that it is appropriate to make PCI and the regulatory body of private TV channels as parties. Admittedly, there is a larger issue,” Justice G Narendar observed while adjourning the hearing to March 23.
 
 Yeddyurappa had approached the high court after the civil court did not grant an interim injunction in a suit filed by him. He produced newspaper clippings showing leaders derisively referring to him as a jailed politician.
 
 C V Nagesh, senior counsel, who appeared for Yeddyurappa, pressed for an interim order at least as far as the media is concerned, insisting damages can be claimed from them if they issue defamatory statements.
 
 In his suit, Yeddyurappa has claimed that Congress leaders, including Siddaramaiah and KPCC president G Parameshwar, are issuing statements on public platforms pertaining to cases involving him. He said some of these cases have already attained finality. 
 
 Siddaramaiah, however, said: “ I have not received any notice from Yeddyurappa yet. But it is a fact that Yeddyurappa was jailed. I have neither lied nor defamed him because everyone knows that he had gone to jail once."
