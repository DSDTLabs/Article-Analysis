KOLKATA: Every time Montu Das — a state-level player — scored a boundary, the spectators went berserk. His partner Subhendu Maiti matched step for step, taking the game to a high-voltage pitch that none expected in an inter-university cricket match. But then, this match was a first of its kind in the country too – played between two blind teams of   and Rabindra Bharati University. No other university had done this before.

 The recent   acted as a catalyst in getting the universities to put their heads together and arrange the match. The fact that two Bengal players had even gone for “trial” when the Indian side was being put together had revved up the enthusiasm further. “Who knows next time a boy from our universities might get selected. This is just a start, we will do everything in our capacity to enthuse our visually challenged cricket team,” said Sabyasachi Basu Raychaudhuri,   vice-chancellor.
 
 Montu, careened the RBU team to victory on Wednesday at the university’s Emerald Bower campus, was not the only university player who has been playing in the state team. There were at least five such boys from the two university teams.
 
 Interestingly, two highest scorers of the match — RBU’s Subhendu Maiti, who remained unbeaten at 54 (he even took a wicket) and Debabrata Khanra, who scored 48, have 100% visual impairment. Subhendu was awarded the man of the match. The captain of the JU side, Mahadeb Jana, who has also been playing in the Bengal team for the past four years, looked a little downcast after his side lost. “We need to practice more,” he said.
 
 JU has recently arranged for practice alongside the regular team. “That gives them scope to stretch beyond their limits,” said Chinmoy Mondal, the coach of the JU team and also the president of the   (CABB).
