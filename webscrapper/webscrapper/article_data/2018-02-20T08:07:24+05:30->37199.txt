AJMER:   of Beawar on Monday poured their heart out to Rajasthan PCC chief   and alleged that if   had started sooner, some lives could have been saved.

 Pilot, on Monday, was in Beawar to visit the families mourning the deaths of their loved ones. While talking to media, Pilot said that it came to his notice that rescue operations had been delayed and therefore, the death toll was high.
 
 “I request the government that the inquiry which was initiated to probe the reason of cooking gas blast should also investigate whether rescue was delayed and if it is so then action should be taken against officials,” he said. He said that it is the duty of government to check the norms on illegal refilling of cooking gas and that responsibility should be fixed.
 
 He also added that government has come up with relief but looking at the condition of these families he demanded ex-gratia be raised to Rs 5 lakh and a family member be offered government job.
