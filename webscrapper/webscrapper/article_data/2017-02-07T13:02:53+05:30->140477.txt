PANAJI: As tough as conveying the complex concepts of finance to school children can be, a story set in Goa could likely help them connect with the characters and grasp the idea of savings and other banking concepts. And what better way to bring this story alive than through cartooning?

 This is exactly the premise of ‘Anu Learns to Save Money’, which narrates the anecdote of two little Goan girls based in   who learn to save for a rainy day. The celebrated Goan cartoonist Mario Miranda’s native village, thus, acts as the perfect setting.
 
 “The idea here is not to impart textbook knowledge, but to introduce basic and crucial financial concepts to children. Basing Anu’s story in Miranda’s village, not only helps serve a local connect but it also attempts to pay tribute to the late cartoonist for his works,” said  , who conceptualized the idea. The stories are a part of the five-book set called ‘Rupee Tales’ penned by Rangappa.
 
 In the aftermath of demonetization and the era of digital money, the stories, therefore, serve as a prefect medium to simplify banking and finance for children. The other stories educate children about insurance, inflation, taxation and the stock market and are based in Varanasi, Lucknow, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, besides Goa. The illustrations adhere to the dressing and behavioural norms of each of these places.
 
 Anu’s story, for instance has a local bakery selling kulkul, while a florist sells kopel. The vibrant colours of Benaras reflect in ‘Vishrambu’s Bus Journey’, while Hyderabad’s rich history is interspersed in ‘One and a Half Stories.’
 
 “There is nothing like the old fashioned way of reading and learning from a book. Besides, digital media would not be able to do justice to the kind of illustrations the books have. That’s the beauty of cartoons which feature in Mario Miranda’s works,” Rangappa said.
