LUCKNOW: Ruling out any role of middlemen in wheat procurement, chief minister   on Friday asked legislators to help in monitoring   centres that will begin wheat procurement from Saturday. 

 “The   wants MLAs and MPs to monitor and ensure that government purchase centres run well and to provide feedback on implementation of government orders,” a spokesman said.
 
 The CM said support price of produce will be directly transferred in the bank accounts of farmers who will be identified through Aadhaar. Yogi also directed DMs to make preparations for purchase and to ensure farmers are extended basic amenities like water and shade while they wait to sell their produce.
