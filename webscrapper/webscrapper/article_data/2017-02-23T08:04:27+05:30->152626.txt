THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Apparently irked by the HC's urt criticism on the `vigilance raj' in the state, vigilance director has issued a notice saying that the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB) won't probe high profile corruption cases from now onwards.

 The notice, which was pasted on the main notice board at the VACB headquarters, was removed after the visual media began to air reports of the same. According to sources, the notice said that that it was being issued in the wake of a high court order on the basis of a petition by opposition leader  . Responding to the developments, chief minister   said that the government would consult with the high court chief justice to standardise the investigation protocol of VACB.
 
 Stating that the government has taken a serious note of the high court's warning against `vigilance raj', the chief minister said the court's observation pointed at the need to standardise the powers of VACB, which now has no discretionary powers to decide whether to probe a case or not.“Besides, anyone can file a petition before the vigilance court, which does not consider its merits before ordering an inquiry ,“ he said.
 
 Meanwhile, Chennithala said that the action of vigilance director amounts to insulting the high court. “The government should make it clear if the vigilance director has the powers to make such kind of comments against the high court,“ Chennithala said.KPCC president   also said that the vigilance director's move was gross disrespect towards the court.
