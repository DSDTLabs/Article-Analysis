AMRITSAR: Coinciding with the demand of the kin of martyrs of   massacre, UK-based   has also demanded full apology from British Prime Minister Theresa May for the same.

 “Following lobbying by a number of Commonwealth leaders, Theresa May is expected to come under pressure at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) next week to commit to make a full apology for the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre before the 100th anniversary next year,”   of Sikh Federation stated in an email sent to TOI on Friday.
 
 He said the Sikhs in the Diaspora have approached political leaders in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, Pakistan and a number of African countries, adding that the Canadian PM Justin Trudeau had been asked to lead the call next week for an apology for the massacre.
 
 Trudeau on May 18, 2016 had made a full apology in the House of Commons for the   incident from 1914 when over 350 passengers were denied entry, starved of food and water for two months with the ship eventually being forced to return to India.
 
 Jallianwala Bagh Shaheed Parivar Samiti president Mahesh Behal said the Samiti wouldn’t settle for anything less than a full apology by the British government in its parliament.
 
 “It is not enough for the UK government today to be supporting and promising funds for a monument in central London to mark the Sikh sacrifices for the freedom of Europe and denying the worldwide Sikh community a full apology in Parliament for the 13 April 1919 massacre that came within months of the Great War,” said the chair of Sikh Federation Amrik Singh.
 
 Behal said the Samiti would soon give a representation to the government to take up the issue with the British government at diplomatic level.
