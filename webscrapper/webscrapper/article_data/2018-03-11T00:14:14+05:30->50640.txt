Udhagamandalam: Tibetan refugees in the Nilgiris conducted a peace march on Saturday on the occasion of the Tibetan Uprising Day, commemorating the 1959 Tibetan uprising against the presence of the People’s Republic of China in Tibet. More than 200 Tibetans clad in their traditional attire and carrying placards took out the procession from the ATC Bus Stand in the hill town. To pay respect to more than 152 people, who sacrificed their lives for the cause of Tibet through self-immolations since February 27, 2009, they chanted prayers during the procession. “We organise a peace march wherever we live on March 10,” said Chinmey Yougyal, a member of the Nilgiri Tibetans’ Association. “Over 1.2 million Tibetans have been killed by the Chinese in Tibet since 1959.”  Those who attended the procession lamented that Tibet, once a peaceful buffer state between India and China, has been transformed into a vast military base. About 74 Tibetan families are living in the hill town for the last 30 years. They have been allotted 74 tiny shops to conduct business near the Government Botanical Gardens. Almost all the Tibetan families are engaged in their traditional trade of woolen garments business. “At this time, when more than 60 years have passed since the Tibetan people first arrived in exile, we take the opportunity to express our thanks with a feeling of great gratitude to the Government and people of India, which has been like a second home to us....”, mentioned a statement of the Tibetan Parliament in Exile.
