KOLKATA: The East-West Metro corridor has passed many historic structures. But not many would know of the heritage shop it has just burrowed past — the first Lawrence & Mayo showroom set up in 1877 (along with the one in London). The building housed Kolkata’s first ‘popular’ restaurant, Peliti’s.

 Looking at the crumbling Dalhousie Square address — 11 Government Place East — which was incidentally identified as being in “very poor condition” by the East West Metro authorities, it is difficult to imagine its illustrious past. Regional manager of Lawrence & Mayo Gabriel Vasanthakumaran said, “This outlet has been operating out of the same place for the past 141 years. This has been our head office ever since it was inaugurated in 1877, a few months after Queen Victoria declared herself the Empress of India.”
 
 But Queen Victoria’s association with the building runs deeper. She had appointed Federico Peliti, who opened his famous restaurant, Peliti’s, at 11 Government Place East in 1881. She had appointed Peliti as the confectioner and chef for Richard Bourke V, Earl of Mayo, Viceroy of British India. By the 1890s, Peliti’s became one of the better known institutions of its time, a place where the business community and the gentry would flock for their traditional Friday family lunch.
 
 The restaurant eventually closed after India’s Independence as the building changed hands in the 1930s. “Rotary Club of Calcutta was set up in this building on September 26, 1919. The building has a memorable past,” Vasanthakumaran said, pointing at the placard that boasts of the memorable Lawrence & Mayo dates, including the Wimbledon Finals of 1923 when   was spotted styling the amulet inspired “glare protectors” from this shop.
 
 “We have been tenants here for the past 141 years. The building changed hands many times and is currently in the custody of the liquidator, Calcutta High Court,” said Vasanthakumaran.
