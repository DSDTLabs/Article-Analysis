Singer   said he cannot complain about shooting underwater scenes in upcoming film ' ' as it was nothing compared to what the real soldiers would have gone through during World War II. 

 The 23-year-old musician, who is making his feature debut with the Christopher Nolan-directed movie, said the ordeal is relatable after one watches the film, according to the reports.
 
  
  
 "Watching the film, it puts it in context what these guys might have actually gone through. It was so real. And it makes it very difficult to complain about what we might have gone through for a few hours," Styles said. 
 
 The ' ' singer added he panicked while shooting the underwater scenes. "It very naturally creates this sense of panic. It's so much that human instinct, that point of being underwater. While you're down there filming and acting out the scene, you're also thinking, 'I cannot breathe for much longer than this' which obviously helps the situation," he said.
