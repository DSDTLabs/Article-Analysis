LUCKNOW: SP chief   on Wednesday courted controversy by claiming that as UP  , he had “forgiven” an   officer who was accused of harassing a fellow woman IPS officer and had stopped the inquiry against the said officer. Yadav added that the same IPS officer had “sent SP workers to jail” during assembly polls.

 In his interaction with reports on the issue of police encounters, Yadav said the problem arises when people die in police custody and senior officers are let loose and fail to ensure justice to the people.
 
 Akhilesh then spoke about the IPS officer who was accused of harassment by his woman officer. “Ek IPS ko humne maaf kar diya tha … ek mahila IPS ne arop laga diya tha uspar …. humne uski jaanch band ki hai … aur wohi adhikari, chunao mein, supari lekar samajwadiyon ko jail bhejne ka kaam kiya (I had forgiven this IPS officer, who was accused by a woman IPS officer of harassment. I had closed the inquiry against him. The same officer sent SP workers behind bars during elections),” said the former CM.
 
 Akhilesh described as a bundle of lies the white paper issued by the Yogi government on the “misrule during 15 years of SP-BSP regime”. He said: “White Paper nahi safeed jhoot hai (It is not a white paper but blatant lie)”.
