CHANDIGARH: Is   president Sanjay   losing his hold on the party? With the   backing the choices of MP   and former MP   for the mayoral elections, the two seem to have managed to rein in the influence of Tandon.

 
 Sources told   that   had spoken to BJP president Amit Shah on Davesh Moudgil as the party’s candidate for the mayor’s post.
 
 
 “One group even tried its level-best not to select Moudgil and spoke to finance minister  . But since Kher had already spoken to Shah, he preferred the MP’s view and directions were passed on to all the concerned,” said a senior party leader.
 
 
 Tandon has been taking major decisions in the party ever since the BJP came to power in the MC in 2015. However, Kher and Jain group had been keenly waiting for an opportune time to show their influence, said sources.
 
 
 “During the selection of two mayoral candidates in 2015 and 2016, Tandon managed to select both of his top loyalists, Arun Sood and Asha Jaswal. This time Sood and some of the first-time BJP councillors were also in the fray. But most of the councillors were not in favour of a second stint for Sood. The second group’s line of argument was that they supported Tandon previously and now Moudgil should be given a chance as he is the most suitable candidate,” said a senior BJP leader.
 
 
 “Kirron Kher remained steadfast on the name of Moudgil. She kept telling councillors close to her to not only give their consent but back Moudgil strongly before party’s senior leaders during the selection process.”
