MADURAI: Earmuffs, hats, jackets and gloves are off and on come sweat pants,   Warmer days are coming early for Madurai, with experts predicting an intense hot season this summer.

 Alarmingly, mercury has touched 30 degrees Celsius on February 2, an unusual sight for the month considering the weather pattern. The district mostly has seen a cool climate from mid-December to late February, but it has all changed this year with early onset of summer. Just three days into the second week, temperatures were seen hovering around at 34 degrees Celsius.
 
 The change in weather pattern has upset the normal life especially those of the morning walkers who said that jogging, a thrilling experience between December and March, has become an uphill task now. “It is no more enjoyable for us,” said   of Surveyor colony. “The temperature is soaring high. We cannot jog even in early morning,” he said.
 
 “There is a saying that the month of Masi will be more chilly than Thai, the winter month. But everything has upside-down now, and Masi has started get hotter,’’ said R Deivanai of Melur. The temperature has started rising even in villages despite having the presence of more trees, he said. The early hot weather has its impact on   prices, too. A tender coconut sold for Rs 35 last week now cost Rs 40. Forecast agencies are predicting that the afternoon temperatures would touch as high as 38 degree Celsius by February 20.
