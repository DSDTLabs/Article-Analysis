NEW DELHI: Power minister   has asked his department and   to study the feasibility of   in order to extend the benefit of   to not just domestic consumers but even tenants. 

 Jain directed his officials and discoms to explore the options of prepaid meters and simplification of documentation for allowing tenants residing in different parts of Delhi to avail of the subsidy benefits. 
 
 Last week, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had directed Jain to address the concerns of tenants deprived of the benefit available to their landlords since February 2015. In a letter, the CM had asked him to prepare a roadmap for this. 
 
 “Rationalising the rates of electricity consumption has been done to reduce the extra burden of erstwhile enhanced rates on each consumer,” the CM had said in his letter. 
 
 Delhi government had first introduced a 50% subsidy for people consuming up to 400 units per month in December 2013, when had come to power for 49 days. This was brought back in February 2014 when AAP returned to power with an absolute majority. 
 
 If the government does execute this plan to extend subsidy, then this would be a big step benefiting many more people in the low-income groups. Unauthorised colonies and slums, too, would benefit from the subsidy. These are also AAP’s core vote banks, and the Kejriwal government has been trying to project its pro-poor image.
