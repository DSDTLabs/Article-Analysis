 The numerous trips to New Delhi to invite Rajiv is said to have caught the latter’s attention. “I used to accompany Congress leader Mallikarjun M Kharge, who was the college president, and my father. When I went for the third time to meet him, Rajiv enquired about my background and asked, ‘Why don’t you join us?’ He meant politics and I just nodded,” Parameshwara had told TOI in an interview.
 
 Parameshwara, who was content as an administrative officer at Sri Siddhartha Education Society, did not expect to plunge into politics and neither did he think his growth in the party would be quick. He was   general secretary and the same year was also given a ticket to contest from Madhugiri, a reserved constituency in Tumakuru, which he won.
 
 On Wednesday, it was an emotional moment for Parameshwara when he became the first   DyCM. Though from a well-to-do Dalit family, he faced discrimination because of his caste.
