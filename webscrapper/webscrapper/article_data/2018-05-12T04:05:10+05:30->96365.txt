THANE: A gang of six ATM robbers were arrested from Ahmedabad highway on Friday. The accused were involved in 26 crimes not only in Thane district but also in Palghar, said officials from the Thane crime branch.

 The sleuths from crime branch unit-5 had received a tip-off that the accused were going to meet near   to hatch a heist plan. 
 
 The accused used to target people living in rural areas as they did not have much knowledge about the functioning of ATMs. 
 
 “We had received a tip off that the six would arrive near Naigaon. We laid a trap and caught them. Two of them,   and  , were the mastermind and had brought the gang together. The duo were booked for similar offences in Uttar Pradesh as well almost a year ago. Khan was out on bail. They came to Mumbai recently and formed their group,’’ said senior inspector from crime branch unit-5 Jayraj Ranaware. 
 
 Their modus operandi would be to find a glitch in the ATM machines. When a customer would visit the ATM, they would feel that the machine is not functioning and leave the transaction incomplete. 
 
 “Once a customer would enter the ATM, one of the accused would enter along with him and pretend to be waiting in line. The accused would sneakily see the customer’s PIN number. He would then stand next to the machine and press a button which was on the side of the machine. So, when the customer is trying to make a transaction, it would suddenly hang. The customer would then feel that the machine isn’t working properly and leave the transaction midway. Once the customer left the other accused would enter the kiosk and complete the transaction,’’ said Ramaware.
 
 Further investigations are on in the case and the officials are trying to find out how they learnt about the glitch. The cops have recovered 13 debit and credit cards which the accused had stolen from the customers.
