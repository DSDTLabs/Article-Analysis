CHANDIGARH: The   (AAP) on Wednesday cautioned people of Punjab and Haryana “against the dangerous designs of SAD and INLD, who are blowing the issue of   out of proportion to create a law and order problem backed by political motives.”

 Bhagwant Mann, AAP MP, said that their party would not allow any water to flow to Haryana because Punjab had no extra water. He said AAP was firm on its stand and would take all legal and political steps, which would be required to resolve the river waters issue.
 
 Mann asked the INLD that why it kept quiet on the issue for the past 10 years when their ally SAD was ruling Punjab. He said that when it was imminent that SAD was going out of power, the INLD suddenly decided to dig the SYL canal. He asked both parties to stop the gimmicks and not try to create a bad situation.
 
 Mann said SAD behaviour was like a defeated army, which was laying land mines before retreating from the battlefield. He asked Parkash Singh Badal and Capt   not to create hurdles in the development of Punjab and accept the verdict of the people of the state with grace.
 
 Mann said SAD and Congress were responsible for selling Punjab river waters to Haryana. He said Badal, who was chief minister in 1978, had allowed his Haryana counterpart Devi Lal to conduct survey for the SYL canal. “Devi Lal had announced in the Haryana Vidhan Sabha that what his predecessors Bhajan Lal and Bansi Lal were not able to obtain, he (Devi Lal) has done with the help of his dear friend Parkash Singh Badal,” Mann said while referring to Vidhan Sabha records. The AAP MP said Devi Lal had given 18 acres of prime land to Badal family in Gurgaon for Orbit resorts in lieu of compromising Punjab’s interests.
