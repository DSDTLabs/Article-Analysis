HYDERABAD: Beaten on the road for the fourth time in six matches,   return to their citadel as they make a stand against the marauding   in what could be a crucial game for both teams as the scramble for a spot in the playoffs heats up in  .

 Sunrisers, this season, have shown a marked distaste for away games as they have struggled to cope up with conditions that are different from their fortress - the Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket Stadium. At home, they have been invincible - having kept a clean slate thus far by winning all five games - but away from the comforts of the known factors,  's men have faltered. Barring the win against   in Mohali and the rained-out game against Royal Challengers Bangalore, Sunrisers have found it difficult to ace their opponents.
 
 Sunrisers could face their biggest test at home as the Supergiant, after a rather indifferent start wherein they lost three of their first four games, have taken giant strides in their quest for a place in the playoffs. They have been on a roll as they have notched six wins in their last seven games to surge to the third place in the points tally.
