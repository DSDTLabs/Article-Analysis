CHENNAI: In a reprieve to the   ( ), the Madras high court has temporarily stayed the release of the Tamil movie ‘Aruva Sandai’, which was allegedly produced with Rs 3.44 crore obtained auto loans from the bank’s Velachery branch. 

 According to a civil suit moved by the bank, it had received 13 loan auto applications with the required documents through D Chitra, a registered auto loan counsellor with the bank. After processing the applications, the bank disbursed loans amounting to Rs 19 lakh to nine people, Rs 52 lakh to two people, and Rs 54.71 lakh and Rs 15 lakh for one each.
 
 However, to the surprise of the bank officials, the auto loans so disbursed were diverted to the personal accounts of the applicants, instead to the car dealers. An inquiry by the officials revealed that Chitra had hacked the user ID and password of the bank officials and had diverted the loan amounts to the personal accounts of the applicants.
 
 This apart, the inquiry revealed that serious lapses had taken place while sanctioning car loans in 2016 as well, through which Chitra had siphoned off public money.
 
 Ultimately, Rs 3.44 crore received by the 13 applicants as auto loans was re-routed to the account of V Esakkiraja, who is the producer of the film ‘Aruva Sandai’ under the banner White Screen Productions, the bank said. A complaint was registered with the central crime branch police. As they failed to act, the bank officials moved the high court on January 23 .
