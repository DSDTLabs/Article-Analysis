 It was the 173rd delivery and just at the stroke of tea that Panchal struck a boundary to complete his 10th hundred in first-class cricket.
 
 Gujarat went into the tea at 192 for 2 and scored 91 runs in the final session even though Parthiv was well set. It was Kaushal Singh delivery that trapped him leg before as the ball straightened after pitching.
 
 Former India A and Delhi Daredevils player Manprit Juneja (12) is at the crease alongside Panchal as Gujarat would be looking at a first innings total in excess of 450 to put pressure on Jharkhand. Vikash with 2/48 in 13 overs was the most successful bowler for Jharkhand.
