BENGALURU:   (ECC), a 30-acre   in the heart of   and  , may become a new haunt for residents.

 The ECC is all set to become a community freethinking space, where people can come together to learn, teach, interact, entertain and offer anything that can help build communities. The space will be thrown open to the public on Sunday . “ECC was conceived at a time when Whitefield was a far-flung location in a sleepy city . But today, it is a bustling place, where people jostle for time and space.Hence we thought we should encourage people to come together to enjoy the pleasures and security of a community,“ said Mathew Chandrankunnel, ECC director.
 
 On Sunday , there will be an all-day carnival, where visitors can engage in various activities. There will be learning corners devoted to music, art, sports, theatre, dance, hobbies and language, apart from food trucks and stalls.Following the carnival, there will be learning corners set up every day for residents to spend quality time away from the din and bustle. “We'll bring together experts from different fields. Once in every two weeks, we will conduct drives like tree planting, community sales, etc.,“ added Mathew.
 
 Like in other parts of the city, in Whitefield too, children, adults and the elderly miss out on open spaces, camaraderie and community connect. This space will be a boon for residents who can connect and network,'' said Sangeeth Varghese, a behavioural leadership researcher and resident of Whitefield.
