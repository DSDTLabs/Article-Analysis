BENGALURU:   for   have climbed to nearly 90% this year. Institutions like   (MCC) have set higher cutoffs, particularly for  , which academicians say are always in great demand as they open up a variety of job avenues.

 
 The cutoff for commerce (industry integrated/international accounting and finance/professional and honours) has climbed to 89% at MCC, a five per cent rise from last year. For regular commerce combinations, it is 85%. The institution offers 900 seats for the stream, which are spread across diverse courses.
 
 V N Raghu, head of the department, business studies, said, “There isn’t much demand for science and arts courses but many opt for commerce because it is easier to enter the job market with a commerce background. The resentment towards engineering or medical streams also contributes to the growing number of commerce students, apart from the myriad options after graduation.”
 
 Typically, cutoffs are decided by the ratio of seats in a particular programme and the number of applications filed. Raghu said the brand name of the college ups the demand among non-Karnataka students, especially those from north India.
 
 For science stream, the cutoff is 77% at MCC. Courses like nanoscience, microbiology and biotechnology in science and psychology and journalism programmes in humanities are more popular, which is why there’s a five per cent increase in cutoff for humanities this year — from 75% to 80% — for students from other PU colleges.
 
 At Jyoti Nivas College in Koramangala, the cutoff for degree programmes in commerce and business studies is 80%, which is similar to last year’s percentage, claimed authorities, adding that this is due to a higher number of applications for these courses. However, the cutoff for science and arts remains 60% this year too.
 
 Sources from Christ (deemed to be university) said they will announce the cutoffs for commerce and arts streams soon.
