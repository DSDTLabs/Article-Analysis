CHANDIGARH: Panjab University (PU) syndicate will take up the matter related to a conflict between 10 faculty members of an affiliated college in   and its officiating principal.

 The faculty members alleged the officiating principal did not constitute an internal complaints committee ( ) to deal with the sexual harassment complaint. The complainant in the sexual harassment case is also one among the 10 teachers who have submitted several complaints against the principal. The faculty members have alleged the complaint was disposed of in one-and-a-half month only without proper investigation. The faculty members have also alleged that the principal was shielding the accused. Other complaints made by the faculty members include that the principal does not follow senior list to form certain committees or for some other works.
 
 However, the officiating principal, in his reply to the deputy registrar, colleges, PU, wrote that these complaints are “false and frivolous”. In his reply, he has stated that he made a fair and impartial ICC in the interest of justice. “…I have also brought this fact to the kind notice of the worth vice-chancellor in my first meeting with him. The committee has given the decision on May 12, 2018. However, I want to enlighten you that during the proceedings of the ICC, the FIR was registered against the accused employee by the police.”
