RANCHI: On Friday, the city woke up to streets wearing a spic and span look.   bins were empty and clean, the mounds of rubbish had vanished and so had the repulsive stench which emanates from public toilets in the city. The reason behind the change was a three-day inspection under Swachh  , in which Ranchi had fared a lowly 62nd in a list of 75 cities across the country. 

 A team of three Swachh Bharat Sarvekshan inspectors,including two field inspectors and one handling logistics, visited   and the Ranchi railway station on Friday. There was no garbage visible on the streets around Gudri Chowk and a public toilet near the chowk, which was visited by one of the inspectors, was clean and functional. Similarly, the Ranchi railway station was also remarkably clean; garbage bins were placed at regular intervals, the pathways and platforms had no litter and even the railway tracks and walls were bereft of filth or betel spit. 
 
 Randhir Kumar Gupta, one of the field inspectors said, "It is too early to say whether the city will do better than last time but I have visited four places since morning and my analysis has been positive so far. Even the inputs we have been receiving from people are positive.''
 
 When asked about parameters of the survey he said, "We are sent instructions every hour to ensure that a city's municipal corporation is kept out of the loop. The places are determined in a way to ensure that slums, public establishments and other important areas in the city are adequately checked for cleanliness.''
 
 The score of a city in   rankings will be based on numerous parameters such as construction of individual houses, community and public toilets to eradicate open defecation and ensuring door-to-door collection and disposal of solid waste.
