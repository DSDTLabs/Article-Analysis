GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat   workers on Wednesday protested against the Naliya sex scandal outside the home of Prime Minister  's mother, Hiraba, on the outskirts of Gandhinagar. The displayed a giant postcard and requested Hiraba to ask the PM to act against BJP leaders allegedly involved in the Naliya sex scandal. Some 80 women workers of the Congress were detained by the police after the protest. 

 The women workers were led by state Mahila Congress president Sonal Patel. Patel, after being detained by police, said: "As the PM's mother is very old we earlier avoided protesting at her house but during notebandi(demonetization) she stood in line at a bank. We thought when the state's women are not safe from BJP leaders and Naliya rape victim is not getting justice she will ask her son to act against the BJP leaders in the state. "The PM used to tell women to write him if they had problems but the PM has not even once expressed sympathy for the Naliya victim. On the contrary, she is being portrayed in a bad light. We tried to give the postcard to the PM's mother but we were not allowed to."
