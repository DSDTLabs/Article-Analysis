 is not someone you’d expect to see on ' '. Yet, the unexpected has happened this season. While his calm demeanour and even temper might seem unsuitable for the reality show, the actor’s wife,  , feels that it’s these very qualities that make him a perfect candidate.

 She says, “Nothing affects Hiten, he seldom loses his cool. He is malleable. He also doesn’t differentiate between celebrities and commoners and will mix with both. One doesn’t need to fight or hurl abuses to become popular. I have just told him to be a leader and not a follower. He should stand up for the right reasons.”
 
 The decision to take up the show wasn’t easy, recalls Gauri, who says, “We were against the show till last year, but we realised that Hiten has done everything except 'Bigg Boss'. Maybe, this was meant to be. Though he is a strong man, the only worrying aspect is that he has never stayed away from us for so long. I always tell people that I have four kids — my twins, dog and Hiten. He hasn’t lifted a glass of water at home. When I asked him if he would be able to do all the chores, he said that he will learn everything during the course of his stay inside the house.” 
 
 Tell her that 'Bigg Boss' is usually considered to be a show that revives and resurrects a flailing career and she says, “I don’t agree with it; an actor gets work on the basis of his talent. The wait might be long, but talent never goes unnoticed.”
 
 Gauri believes that just like his participation, Hiten might surprise everybody by winning the show as well. So, will she ever try her luck with Bigg Boss? “Never. My temperament might not be conducive for the show. Hiten and I are opposites; while he is even-tempered, people call me Jhansi Ki Rani,” she signs off.
