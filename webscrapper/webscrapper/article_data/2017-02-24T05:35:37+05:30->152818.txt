NEW DELHI: Was a combination of police’s failure to manage crowd, indiscipline and lack of monitoring by senior officers to blame for the ruckus at  ? It would appear so. The area special commissioner, S B K Singh, admitted that he was unaware of any orders to forcefully remove protesters from the spot.

 A group of DU students protested outside police headquarters on Thursday, demanding an “impartial probe” into Wednesday’s incident and separate FIRs into complaints filed by Left-backed student groups and ABVP.
 
 Sources said that with senior officers failing to reach the spot, there were no clear orders on how to deal with the protesters. There was little coordination between policemen from three different battalions. Though cops created a human chain to separate the two sets of protesters, students alleged that efforts to intervene when stone-pelting started were half-hearted. 
 
 The decision to remove protesters blocking the road near   police station was also apparently taken without warning. The policemen on ground seemed ill-prepared to deal with the situation. Most protesters were first- and second-year DU students. “We were dragged by hair, kicked and punched as if we were criminals,” said  , a member of AISA.
 
 DCP Jatin Narwal stationed at Maurice Nagar was apparently unaware of the situation on ground and reacted only after mediapersons approached him. A journalist who was allegedly assaulted by the police said: “They snatched mobile phones and tried to delete clips and photos. By the time senior officers intervened, the damage had already been done.”
