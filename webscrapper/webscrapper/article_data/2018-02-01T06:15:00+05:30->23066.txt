Trounced by demonetisation in 2016 and the rolling out of GST last year, Indians across professions and income groups are now looking for some relief from the government. 

 “The last four years have been terrible for business persons,” says Tehseem A Junaid, a hardware dealer. “The tax slabs should be reasonable enough so that people happily pay their dues and feel a sense of pride in being taxpaying citizens,” she says.
 
 Harried by the slew of taxes and the paper work involved, Sadhana Jha, who trades in chemicals, says after demonetization and GST the trader fraternity is now grappling with e-way bill. “This is being implemented from February 1 and the non-compliance penalties can go up to three times of the bill amount. 
 
 “I don’t know what to expect from the budget. All I want is some relief in paperwork as business persons are left with no time for any leisure and social activity and are just handling accounts. Under this new tax regime, a small negligence can result in heavy losses,” she says.
 
 Not just those in business, others too are grappling with accounts and net banking. “After demonetisation, cash in hand has become nil,” says homemaker Neelima Verma. “I am hoping for some ease in making payments in cash. I am not very conversant with net banking and the banks are now putting a limit on the number of chequebooks to be issued,” she says. 
 
 The trouble doubles when it comes to the semi-literate sector, says Manjusha Pande, a retired bank employee. “I can transfer the salary that I pay to my maids in their accounts but they find it very difficult to go to banks and withdraw the money. Going cashless is a good thought but using plastic or wire money makes me uneasy as it needs a lot of alertness and accounting,” she says.
 
 Brushing off concerns like inflation, Nandita Sharma, a schoolteacher close to retirement says, “Except for fuel, the prices of domestic items have remained stable over past four years. But the government now seriously needs to take care of citizens who have been paying their taxes honestly over a lifetime. There should be retirement benefits in form of medical aid and higher interest rates on fixed deposits for them,” she says.
 
 Business got a boost with the use of plastic money, feels Meenakshi Desai who runs a beauty salon. “I want some more relaxation in rules and ease of doing business for women entrepreneurs. GST has not helped in lowering prices of goods that we use in our salon but otherwise the grocery bill has gone down a bit,” she says.
