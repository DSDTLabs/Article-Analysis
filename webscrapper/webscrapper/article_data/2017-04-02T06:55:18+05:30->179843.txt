PATNA: DGP P K Thakur on Saturday had a videoconferencing with zonal IGs, range DIGs, SSPs and SPs on   being made for the   celebrations on Wednesday.

 The meeting assumes significance in that   marred the Durga Puja celebrations at quite a few places in the state last year. 
 
 Sources said the situation is a little critical this time as home guard jawans have been on indefinite strike since March 15. If not on strike, at least half of the state’s 70,000-odd home guards are “active” and deployed on law and order duty. 
 
 The recent arrests from the Indo-Nepal border areas in connection with attempts to blow railway tracks, are another reason why the state police do not want to leave anything to chance.
 
 Talking to TOI after the meeting, the DGP said the Union government has been requested to send four companies of central armed forces for their deployment in sensitive areas during Ram Navami festivities.
 
 “Untoward incidents took place in districts during festive celebrations in recent times. We know which areas are prone to such ugly incidents, and we will make foolproof arrangements to ensure that the festival passes off peacefully,” he said, adding police forces were being mobilised in a special manner in view of the home guards’ stir. 
 
 “Field officers have been directed to take preventive and precautionary measures. The state police HQ is constantly taking feedback from every district. No Ram Navami processsion will be allowed if the organisers have not taken licence,” the DGP said and added peace committee meetings were being held in all the districts in this regard.
