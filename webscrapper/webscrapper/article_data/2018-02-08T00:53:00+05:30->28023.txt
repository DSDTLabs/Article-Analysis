Trichy: Cracking down on the sale of banned plastic bags and cups, the health wing of Trichy Corporation seized three tonnes of plastic from shops around Gandhi market area on Wednesday. The action was part of civic body’s drive against the use of pastic within city limits. A team led by City Health Officer (CHO) Dr R Chithra carried out the raid, which brought to light the storage of plastic items of inferior quality. “All the plastic seized were below 50 microns, which will not help in biodegradation. They were kept for retail sales at the shops. The raid will continue in all the areas in the city,” Chithra told ToI on Wednesday. The total worth of the seized items would be around Rs 3 lakhs. The action against the erring shopkeepers was yet to be initiated. The officials however have warned of imposing fine up to Rs 1 lakh, if they continued to violations. Stating that the drive will be carried out every Wednesday, CHO said that the raids in the past few weeks led to the seizure of around five tonnes of banned plastic in the city. Even though the civic body insisted on abandoning plastics, which were harmful to the environment, they were unable to stop the inflow of such banned items.  Yet, the crackdown on the retailers using such items brought about a positive change in the mindset of the people to carry cloth bags.
