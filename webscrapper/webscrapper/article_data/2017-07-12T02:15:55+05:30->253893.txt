NAVI MUMBAI: Elderly people and physically challenged commuters have been facing a tough time while crossing skywalks at   and   along Thane Belapur road as all four elevators installed at two foot overbridges (FOB) have been shut for two months. 

 It has been learnt that the annual maintenance contract had expired few months back, prompting the contractor to discontinue its service. But civic officials refused to admit the lapse. On the other hand,   said power fluctuation had affected the functioning of the lifts.
 
 “We have faced snags in the lifts many a times. But now all the lifts have been left useless. The credibility of the civic administration’s claim for providing high-tech elevator facility is being questioned. It has become a nightmare for handicapped commuters,” said Sheetal Kore, a physically-challenged commuter. 
 
 A representative of the elevator maintenance agency said, the contract expired in January. “We continued service on goodwill. But for the last two months we have been waiting for it to be renewed. We have made our stand clear that we will not be responsible for mishaps.”
