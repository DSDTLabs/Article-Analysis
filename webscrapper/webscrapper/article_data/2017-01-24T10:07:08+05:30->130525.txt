PUNE: Warmer winter temperatures are likely in the country till early February this year. The   (IMD) has forecast normal to above normal winter temperatures for most parts of the country during the next few days, including   and Maharashtra. 

  PK Nandankar, head of the weather forecasting division of IMD, Pune told TOI that the anti-cyclone over the lower tropospheric level of Central India is contributing to significant insulation over India. 
 
 "The trapped radiation is increasing temperatures. Consequently, the warm and moist easterly and south-easterly winds from peninsular India are reaching as far as central India, including Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, pushing up temperatures in the region," he said.
 
 An IMD outlook released on January 19 for the next two weeks had suggested that below normal temperatures during the first week of February may give way to normal to above normal temperatures over most parts of the country thereafter.
 
  "The minimum temperatures are very likely to be below normal over northern parts of the country and southeast peninsular India during the first half of the week and are likely to be normal to above normal over most parts of the country after that," it said. The outlook added that the cold wave conditions may also begin to abate after the first half of the week from January 19. 
 
 Maximum temperatures may also be normal to above normal over most parts of the country after the first week from January 19.
