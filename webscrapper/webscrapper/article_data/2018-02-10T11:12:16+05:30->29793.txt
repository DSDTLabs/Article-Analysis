HYDERABAD: Chief minister K   left for Delhi on Friday. While the   could not indicate the purpose of his visit, it is learnt that the chief minister is going there for treatment of a dental problem. For the last few years, Chandrasekhar Rao is said to have been suffering a tooth ache. He, however, held a couple of review meetings at   before he left for Delhi. It is not clear how many days he would be in the national capital.

 Chandrasekhar Rao going to Delhi in the wake of the TRS expressing displeasure at the raw deal meted out to it in the central budget is significant. A meeting with some Union ministers is not ruled out to ask for more funds for various projects. However, so far no appointments have been fixed as yet. While a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra   is not on the agenda, TRS sources said if this works out, the chief minister would like to meet him on the budget issue. However, it may be mentioned here that Prime Minister Modi on Friday left for a three-nation tour and will return to Delhi only on February 12. However, it is not clear yet for how many days the CM will stay in Delhi. “The only reason for the chief minister going to New Delhi is for a dental check up,” a TRS source said. It may be recalled that in the past, the chief minister had also gone to Delhi for an eye-surgery. It is likely that he will get an eye check up also done.
 
 Meanwhile, in Delhi, health minister C   met Union minister of health and family welfare   at   and submitted a memorandum to him listing out the needs of Telangana.
 
 He reiterated the demand of Telangana for an AIIMS like hospital.
