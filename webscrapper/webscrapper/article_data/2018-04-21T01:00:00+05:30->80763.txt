Actor  , who was last seen on Bhaag Bakool Bhaag, has been blessed with a girl. His wife Pooja, who he tied the knot with in 2014, delivered the baby on April 18. The ecstatic father tells us, “I am on cloud nine. I can’t even begin to explain how it feels. I was inside the operation theatre with Pooja and I am really proud of her. She was so strong throughout. When the doctor announced that it was a girl, both of us started screaming with joy. I didn’t even realise that I had tears when the baby looked at me for the first time. It was surreal.”

 He adds, “My daughter was born on the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tritiya. She is truly a blessing for us. My friends and relatives have been telling me that ‘Laxmi aayi hai on such an auspicious day.”
