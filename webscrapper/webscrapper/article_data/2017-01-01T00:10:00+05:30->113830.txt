NAVI MUMBAI: The   is facing some hurdles in implementing the state government order of not issuing temporary licences for serving liquor to housing societies and commercial establishments within 500m of the state and national highways on New Year’s Eve. 

 The Raigad excise department, which supervises the areas from Kharghar to the Goa highway, had to implement the order with skeletal staff. 
 
 Many excise inspectors have been using their private two-wheelers to get around “as new four-wheelers were expected to arrive shortly”.
 
 Nilesh Sangade, excise superintendent, Raigad, said that he has communicated the staff shortage issue to the department and even to the minister. But sources said that even the sanctioned post for inspectors have not been filled up.
 
 Sangade told TOI on Saturday that they need 20 inspectors. “But I have just three. Six as out of 12 sub inspectors we have are in police academy for training,” he added. 
 
 Raigad excise sources described the wooded areas of Panvel, Khopoli and Karjat along old Bombay-Goa highway as hot spots. The department plans to zero on watering holes, resorts and farm houses that are near highways to ensure that liquor is served only in permit rooms. 
 
 Only two inspectors of Thane district will be keeping vigil on the Sion-Panvel highway from Vashi to  .
 
 The Supreme Court order asked the Centre and states to withdraw licences of all bars and liquor shops within 500m of highways at the earliest.
