AURANGABAD: A 28-year-old man has been booked by the city police on charges of   a 26-year-old woman on the pretext of marriage.

 After staying together for a while, the suspect even forced the woman to terminate her pregnancy. Based on the complaint lodged by the woman, the Kranti Chowk police have booked the suspect under sections 313 (causing miscarriage without woman's consent), 420 (cheating and dishonesty) and 493 (cohabitation caused by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful marriage) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Police informed that the woman lodged a police complaint after the woman redressal cell failed to resolve the issue. Investigation officer and police sub-inspector CV   informed that the suspect before starting his own travel agency was an employee of a travel agency for few years.
 
 “In August 2013, the suspect came in touch with the woman who was heading to Pune from   central bus stand. The suspect had arranged her ticket for Pune and got her number saying she may contact him if she needs to travel back to Aurangabad,” he said.
 
 “They soon started speaking frequently and their friendship soon turned into relationship. The duo even travelled together to different places including Lonavala,” he added.
 
 Later, the duo decided to marry and started living together in the city. As per the complaint lodged by the woman, after she became pregnant, the accused started insisting her to abort the child. “After she refused to budge, the suspect forcefully took her to a city-based hospital where her pregnancy was aborted against her wish,” he said.
 
 Realising that the suspect is not serious about the relationship, she started pestering him for marriage. The suspect soon refused to continue the relationship and deserted her.
 
 “The suspect realising that the woman would lodge a police complaint against him, has gone underground. We are trying to trace him so that the case can be investigated,” Thube said.
