 “After prohibition, this campaign will bring another big revolution in the state. It hurts me that   stands second in dowry related deaths and atrocities. I am sure such evil practices will be reduced to a great extent within a year,” said Nitish and added, “Launching of new campaign does not mean neglecting prohibition. There could be no better way of paying homage to Bapu than enforcing prohibition in the state.”
