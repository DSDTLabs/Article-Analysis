KOCHI: A mentally-ill woman was brutally assaulted by three of her women neighbours at  , Vypeen, on Monday morning even as hundreds of people remained mute spectators. A video clip of the incident later went viral on social media, drawing attention to the brutality.

 Police have arrested the women — Liji Augustine, Teena and Molly — and booked them under IPC Sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention). 
 
 Police said the women had assaulted the victim for creating a ruckus in her house on Sunday night. Her husband and daughter were also not spared. She was assaulted again at a tea shop near   ferry on Monday and later dragged out and beaten up. Liji allegedly placed a hot spatula also on her leg.
 
 Residents said the victim used to hurl invectives at passersby and even throw stones at them. The teenaged daughter also suffered bruises in the attack. On Monday morning, four persons allegedly took the girl to   police station and made her give a statement that she did not have any complaint.
 
 “The victim’s father-in-law informed me about the incident and requested me to come to the police station. Police advised us to take the girl to a hospitalbut she refused to come,” said  , a ward member of Pallipuram panchayat.
 
 Munambam police said residents had lodged complaints against the victim. “She used to get violent whenever we went to her house. Once she was produced before a magistrate for sending her to a mental hospital but was released later,” sub-inspector T V Shibu said.
