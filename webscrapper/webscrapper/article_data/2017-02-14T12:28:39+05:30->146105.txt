GUWAHATI: The Assam government believes that a victim of eve-teasing at  , whose post about her harassment on Facebook sparked off a spontaneous protest by thousands of students in the town on February 9, should have taken her complaint to the police and not the social media. 

 The girl's post came as a jolt for the police administration, which launched a drive to "clean" the town of such miscreants. Specially trained women police and men in plain clothes have been deployed along the roads leading to schools and colleges. Assam Police special DG met all stakeholders of the society on Saturday to instil a sense of confidence among the people.
 
 But when parliamentary affairs minister   questioned the victim for not going to police first, more than a few eyebrows were raised. "She should have gone to police first rather than going to the social media," Patowary said. "We have come to know that the victim is a member of SFI (Student's Federation of India)," he added.
 
 Many, in fact, believe that it was the girl's decision to speak out about her mental trauma on social media that goaded the police into action.
 
 The issue was raised by a woman legislator of the Bodoland People's Front, a partner of   in the ruling alliance,  , in the assembly on Monday. She later said outside the house, "Eve-teasing and sexual harassment are not just problems faced in Jorhat but across the entire state. We, too, had to go through the trauma when we had to walk seven to eight kilometres daily to our schools and colleges," she said.
