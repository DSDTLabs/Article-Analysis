Jabalpur: Madhya Pradesh High Court (MPHC) on Tuesday rejected anticipatory bail plea filed by the then additional superintendent of police and an assistant sub-inspector, who are accused of beating   Suresh Yadav in Balaghat district on September 25 last year.

 A single bench of the HC comprising Justice J K Maheshwari dismissed anticipatory bail plea saying if the accused had to secure a bail, they should first surrender before the court.
 
 On September 25 last year, Baihar police acted on a complaint against Yadav for objectionable social media posts against Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi. Later, Yadav lodged a complaint that he was tortured in police custody. This triggered mob fury at police station, prompting the BJP-ruled government to take action against police personnel.
 
 Subsequently, six policemen including ASP, one inspector and four other cops, were booked for attempt to murder and robbery.
 
 Of the six accused, additional SP Rajesh Sharma and assistant sub-inspector Anil Ajmeria filed anticipatory bail plea before the court.
 
 Public prosecutors objected to the bail petition of police officers, saying, â€˜No police officer has the right to take law in his hands and misbehave with citizens. Yadav was injured due to beating by cops, thus cops should not be granted the bail. After hearing all arguments, the court rejected the bail plea of the cops.
