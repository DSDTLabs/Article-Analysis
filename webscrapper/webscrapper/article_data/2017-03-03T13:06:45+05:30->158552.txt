THANE: Frequent travellers within the city are   with the   connecting the city with  .

 Activists claim, the route of the 32km-long new service skirts the city and is unlikely to make a major difference to city residents here. 
 
 "The new service has nearly 24 stops of which barely eight including Kalwa naka, Vitawa, Shilphata, Kalyan phata, Padle to name a few fall under the TMC limits, while the rest come under the Navi Mumbai and Kalyan municipal corporation areas. How will it benefit Thane taxpayers," questioned activists.
 
 The new service numbered 77 has been started from March 1 with a frequency of 25 minutes and connecting Chendani Koliwada to Dombivli west. Seven buses from the newly acquired fleet of the tmt with capacity of 55 each have been deployed on this routes. The service will take nearly 1hour 25minutes to cover the distance between the two cities.
 
 "Already, there is a regular complaint from commuters about inadequate frequency of TMT buses. Why is the undertaking interested in running these buses outside Thane when there is a huge demand within the city," questioned Seema Sharma a daily commuter.
 
 Further, commuters questioned on patronization of the new services as it is practical to travel by train in 30 minutes than spend a fortune daily on the long trips.
 
 Activists have suggested curtailing the route or diverting it via Kalwa to make it more feasible or deploying the buses within the citythat faces massive shortage of frequencies.
 
 Sudhir Raut, tmt manager said they are looking into the issue and claimed they will take corrective action in case the demand is less on the segment.
