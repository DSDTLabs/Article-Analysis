PUNE: Safe Kids Foundation, a non-profit organization, has joined hands with   and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation to conduct a week-long fire safety awareness campaign across the city. The drive began on Monday, which was National Fire and Evacuation Drill Day.

 The campaign will feature fire safety procedures from Honeywell’s ‘Safe kids at home’ programme, fire safety related activities, including drills, volunteer training, and an inter-school exhibition. A statement issued by the foundation said 450 people have so far registered as fire marshals, called Agni Suraksha Mitras, to help deal with emergencies. 
 
  chief fire officer Prashant Ranpise said, “As per Union government norms, we are conducting mock fire drills in schools. Disaster preparedness not only can mitigate fire accidents, but also avert property damage and loss of lives.”
 
 Kiran Gawade, chief fire officer, PCMC, said, “While the department does its best to reduce loss during fire accidents, prevention is the best course of action. We hope to encourage fire safety practices among citizens throughout the week.”
 
 Cinthia Pinto, program director, SKFI, said, “More than 20,000 students, 550 teachers and 1,000 parents will receive fire safety training this year. We expect more Punekars to join us and help make Pune a ‘safe kids at home’ city.”
