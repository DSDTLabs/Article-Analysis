Director Raghu Shivamogga’s short film   hit the bullseye last year, what with it winning awards for best short film at almost all short film platforms. The short film paved the way for his first soon-to-be-released feature film, Churikatte. “As writers and people in the film industry, one always has at least 2-3 stories ready to be adapted for the screen. When my producers approached me to make a film for them, I zeroed-in on   as I felt that this story would ensure I create a name for myself as a director and story writer,” says Raghu, as a matter of fact.

 The story is set in Malnad, close to where Raghu spent most of his growing years. “The area around where I grew up is infamous, thanks to the timber mafia. Even though I did not have direct access to information on what goes on there, any piece of news about those who got caught and those who got away became public knowledge for residents of the area. Add a bit of research to that and I had a solid script — a work of fiction based on reality,” explains Raghu, who has been a student at  . While this will mark his first full-length feature film as director, direction, or for that matter acting or the intricacies of filmmaking from various departments, is hardly new for Raghu. “I began working with   before directing around 20 one-hour long films for B Suresha for television. I also directed the TV show Madarangi, which had 670 episodes. I have also done my share of acting on TV and have been involved with everything from lighting to art direction. This film is my next step forward,” he tells us.
