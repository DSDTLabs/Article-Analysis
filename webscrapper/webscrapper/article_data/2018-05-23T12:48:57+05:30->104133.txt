PUNE: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation ( ) has appointed a contractor for the underground shafts as well as the Swargate Metro station. 

 The contractor will construct vertical underground shafts at Swargate and the agriculture college. These shafts will be used to lower tunnel-boring equipment to build the underground Metro route. 
 
 
  
 
 “Apart from the construction of the shafts, the contract also includes construction of the Swargate station and its multimodal integration. The actual ground work is expected to begin from next month,” a MahaMetro official said.
 
 The underground route will connect the Range Hills and Swargate stations, passing through Shivajinagar, Civil Court, Phadke Haud and Budhwar Peth. It is part of the Pimpri-Swargate corridor. 
 
 MahaMetro officials have identified the locations for the shafts. The officials have taken possession of the plot in Swargate from the Pune Municipal Corporation, while the land in Shivajinagar was handed over by the agriculture college. 
 
 Now that the land is in hand, officials said, work should begin in the next few days. 
 
 The Swargate station is a crucial cog of the Metro project. The station — coming up at Jedhe Chowk opposite Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation’s existing bus terminus — will also serve as a multimodal hub. MahaMetro has planned underground walkways to connect the station with the terminus, PMPML bus stand and other public transport services.
 
 MahaMetro has also come out with an elaborate plan to reduce traffic congestion at Jedhe chowk. According to MahaMetro officials, integrating public transport services and private vehicles at a single point will go a long way in easing daily snarls at the perennially busy chowk.
 
 The hub is the first such project in the city being constructed by MahaMetro, jointly with PMC, PMPML and the state transport body.
