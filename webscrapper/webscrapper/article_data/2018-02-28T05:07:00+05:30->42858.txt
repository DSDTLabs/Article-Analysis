NOIDA: Nearly a year after UP principal secretary (industries)   had asked the horticulture department of Noida to draw up a plan for ‘dust-free’ city, the Authority has finally swung into action. In the first phase of the plan, a   will be undertaken on 55 kilometres across seven arterial roads in the city, at a cost of Rs 2.30 crore. Officials said the tenders for selecting the agency to carry out the plan will be initiated in March.

 The decision follows the submission of a report by a nine-member committee, which was formed in January this year to chalk out a detailed plan to improve basic civic amenities for the citizens of Noida and to ensure dust-free environment in a time-bound manner. The committee was headed by additional CEO (ACEO) RK Mishra.
 
 According to officials, the aim is to make Noida a better place to live in. In order to make the city dust-free, the horticulture department has identified seven main roads and will convert them into model ‘green’ streets. “In the first phase, we have decided to take up roads in Sector 82 (4.5 km), sectors 90 and 138 (2.29 km), Sector 93 B (4 km), Sector 137 (5 km), Hosiery complex (28 km) and phase 2 (12 km),” Mishra said. “These stretches witness maximum dust and air pollution in the city,” he said.
 
 “Plants and grass will be planted on both sides of the roads to ensure dust-free zones,” said Ombeer Singh, director, horticulture,  . “The greenery will be maintained for a period of two years by the company selected through tendering and will remain under vigilance of the respective work circle in-charges,” he explained. 
 
 “Grass, seasonal flowers, trees, shrubs and fragrant plants will be planted. We will also ensure strict action against anyone contributing to the rise of   in the city,” he added.
