THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In yet another grisly reminder of how atomised city life has become, an elderly man's death went unnoticed for days, probably even weeks, by his neighbours till his daughter, worried about not having heard from him for so long, discovered his skeleton in his drawing room on Sunday.

 Police said that the body of 70-year-old K P  , a retired tutor at dental college, was found in almost fully decomposed state inside his house. He had been living alone in a two-storied partly completed house at   here.
 
 His daughter, a PG medical student married to a doctor, lives with her mother in Kottayam. Radhakrishnan and his wife   had been living separately for the past few years. Occasionally they would talk over the phone and according to police had last spoken to each other four months ago. Recently, Radhakrishnan's daughter had come to visit him but returned after finding the door locked. On Sunday , she came again only to find unattended bills and letters on the doorstep. Medical college police was informed who forced the door open and found the body in a decomposed state on the sofa. Medical college police SHO Girilal B said that Radhakrishnan led a secluded life and barely spoke to anyone.
 
 The body was released to relatives after inquest and postmortem and police have registered a case of unnatural death.
