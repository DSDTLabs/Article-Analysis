AHMEDABAD: It’s been nine months since the 535.7 hectares consisting of 2,696 properties in Ahmedabad’s   area was nominated by   as a World Heritage Site. 

 The tag came with enormous responsibility of putting in place a protection and conservation management plan. But increasingly, it is now being felt that unless there is citizen’s participation the implementation of these plans will turn out to be difficult.
 
  
 In July last year, International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), Unesco’s think tank, recommended a detailed ‘to do’ list to the state government. The report mentioned many challenges facing the Walled City which included increasing development pressures like commercial development and traffic congestion, which were causing original inhabitants to move out of the area.
 
 The ICOMOS report also said that increasingly, traditional pol houses were rented for commercial purposes or to newcomers who do not have the same bonds with the historic fabric. This, according to ICOMOS was causing changes to the community structures and the rapid deterioration of the historic houses, sometimes resulting in the wilful demolition of historic architectural or decorative elements.
 
 “We have laws in place and a system of approval as well, but we need local Walled City inhabitants to comply with these laws to speed up the process of approvals. There is still lack of awareness among locals on the new set of laws,” said a senior official of AMC’s town planning department. 
 
 The ICOMOS report mentioned environmental pressures which include moisture penetration through cracks or rising damp, termite infestation of wooden elements, and the impacts of industrial pollution to be playing a detrimental effect on private heritage properties. “All these agents of deterioration are magnified by the lack of maintenance,” said the ICOMOS report.
