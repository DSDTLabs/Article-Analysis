NEW DELHI: The   stayed deportation of two Sudanese on Friday for a week but also bluntly asked civil rights activists who want the government to be more forgiving towards refugees who breach conditions attached to their stay in the country if the same would have been allowed by the US.

 Abench headed by Chief Justice   made an exception to the ‘queue for justice’ rule and accepted senior advocate Colin Gonsalves’s request for urgent hearing of the petition by 23-year-old Amir   and 30-year-old Salih Ali Bezal Eissa, whose deportation was upheld by the Delhi HC.
 
  Gonsalves attempted to paint a story of two ethnic Sudanese getting hounded by the authorities in strife-torn African nation and how they were lucky to escape death even as their family members were killed.
