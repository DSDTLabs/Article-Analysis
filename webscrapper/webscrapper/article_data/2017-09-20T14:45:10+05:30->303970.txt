JAIPUR: In a tribute to his late father  , a   who painted posters of 
 , his son M D Gupta has decided to donate two of them to a planned government film museum in Mumbai.

 Back in the old days, when printing was not popular, B M Gupta used to paint posters of   movies. He has created hundreds of such paintings, including that of ‘Mother India’ and ‘Pakeezah’.
 
 His son has now decided to donate the original paintings of these posters to the Mumbai museum. “I will donate them during ‘Navratras’ to the museum. I received communication from the authorities that they have selected two paintings—’Mother India’ and ‘Pakeezah’—for it. The museum will be inaugurated soon,” said Gupta.
 
 The ‘Pakeezah’ poster, painted in 1972, is 54x34 inch while the ‘Mother India’ (1957) one is 36x24.
 
 B D Gupta,(1935-2001) has painted hundreds of Bollywood posters at his studio, situated in the Walled City. “Now, we have printed posters, but, earlier, hand-painted posters of movies used to be displayed in the lobby of cinema halls. These were lively and expressed the soul of the film,” said Gupta.
 
 “The art is obsolete and there is hardly any such painter alive today. These paintings have become precious,” said Gupta.
 
 Initially, he didn’t know the value of these paintings until an American businessman approached him in 2002 to buy them.
 
 “My father died in 2001 and the American came here in 2002. When I searched my father’s store, I found 16 such paintings of films released in 60s, 70s and 80s. I sold the ‘Deewar’ painting to a businessman of Mumbai in Rs 1 lakh,” said Gupta.
 
 He has also found incomplete paintings of ‘Sholay’ (1975) and ‘Taj Mahal’, which was released in 1963. “Such paintings have become rare now. It was a difficult job as it required time and the artist had to paint faces of artists very accurately,” he said.
 
 But Gupta is happy that two of his father’s paintings have been selected for display at the film museum.
