THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government would frame a comprehensive law for making admissions to medical seats in the wake of Supreme Court order, said chief minister   here on Monday.

 Chairing an all-party meeting to discuss the admissions in the academic year 2017-18, he said that the government will hold discussions with the managements and the law would be framed on the basis of the opinions aired by the political partiesat the meeting.
 
 Political party representatives demanded that admissions should only be based on merit and while equalising the fee for all seats, the government should ensure that economically backward students are given opportunity. According to the SC order, the admissions to all seats, including management and NRI seats, should only be made from the list prepared on the basis of National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET).
 
 Congress and IUML kept away from the meeting alleging that they did not receive any invitation, while the chief ministerâ€™s office maintained that invitations were sent. Opposition leader   said that he was not even informed over the phone about the meeting.
 
 With the court order and the subsequent directive from the Centre, the admissions are likely to be entangled in prolonged legal battle as the managements have been demanding a fee hike in all seats. 
 
 Political party leaders including M Vijayakumar (CPM), K Krishnan Kutty (JD-S), K M Mani (KC-M),   (CPI), V V Rajesh (BJP) and Uzhavoor Vijayan (NCP) participated at the meeting.
