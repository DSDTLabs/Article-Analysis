KOZHIKODE: Welfare Party of India’s national president   has said that there was no chance for an out-of-court settlement on the   dispute as Hindu organizations were adamant that there was no need to establish the site as the birth place of Lord Ram with evidence.

 Addressing a news conference here on Saturday, he said the Muslim organizations have stated that they will give up their claim on the land if there is conclusive proof to establish that that particular place is where Lord Ram was born. “But they said it is matter of faith, which doesn’t need any evidence,” he said. As many as five attempts were made in the past by persons, including former prime ministers, to settle the dispute. “But all of them failed and there is a little renewed attempt. Welfare Party will work to build a common platform for secular parties to fight the threat of Sangh Parivar. Bihar has proved that if the secular parties join together, they can easily defeat the forces of Sangh Parivar,” Ilyas said.
 
 State president of Welfare Party Hameed Vaniyambalam said that there were reasons to believe that BJP national president Amit Shah was directly involved in creating communal tensions in Kerala. “He is using DGP Loknath Behera to achieve this goal. A kind of ‘survival state’ is being created in Kerala,” he said.
 
 Ilyas was in the city as part of a national agitation yatra that began from Kota in Rajasthan on April 1. Welfare Party leaders visited the houses of Zacharia in Parappanangadi, who was lodged in a Bengaluru prison and Faizal, who was murdered at Kodinhi a few months ago.
