Mumbai:   has denied that it had ever engaged  , promoted by CEO Chanda Kochhar’s brother-in-law, for any services. There are allegations that the private lender and its CEO were exposed to a conflict-of-interest situation because companies to which ICICI Bank provided loans had availed of services from Avista.

 “We would like to categorically state that ICICI Bank has never engaged Avista Advisory Group for any services at all. Hence, the allegation of conflict of interest, as reported by a section of media, is totally baseless and mala fide in intent,” the bank said in a statement.
 
 Avista Advisory describes itself as an independent boutique integrated financial services company that was focused on Southeast Asia and India regions.
 
  Kochhar — brother of Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak — is a career banker who had worked with 20th Century Finance and Tata Finance before setting up Avista Advisory Group. 
 
 The firm has provided advisory services to a number of large corporates, which were also borrowers of ICICI Bank.
 
 Earlier, the private lender had said that the brother of a husband does not fall within the definition of a “relative” under the Companies Act, 1956 or 2013. Therefore, there was no requirement of making any disclosure of such a relationship.
 
 In a separate statement to the stock exchanges, ICICI Bank said that in 2016 the lender’s board had undertaken an internal review following rumours that the bank’s CEO faced a conflict of interest because of her husband’s business dealings. “This review confirmed that there was no material finding indicating any lapse,” the bank said.
