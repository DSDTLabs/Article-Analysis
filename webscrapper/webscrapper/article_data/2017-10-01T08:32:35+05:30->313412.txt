BHUBANESWAR: For years, the 9-km stretch of Puri beach near   waste water treatment plant was an eyesore with garbage and sewage littering the shore. 

 Today, the beach is totally litter-free thanks to efforts of well-known sand sculptor  . The Puri-based   launched a hungerstrike on July 11 on the beach that had been neglected for years.
 
 Support from tourists and residents for Pattnaik's cause poured in, leaving the administration anxious about negative publicity for a tourist destination like Puri.
 
 Ultimately, Pattnaik's initiative was rewarded and the Odisha housing and urban development department floated a tender on July 14 for the renovation of the defunct waste water treatment plant.
 
 The Puri administration also mobilised sweepers to clean the beach. "We also took the initiative to stop sewage seeping from the plant to the beach. The treatment plant will be renovated soon," district collector Aravinda Agarwal said.
 
 Tourists are happy. "I no longer find garbage, animal carcasses or sewage on the beach," said  , a German tourist, a frequent visitor to Puri.
 A few months ago, Pattnaik was roped in by the Maharashtra government to promote Swachha Bharat drive in Mumbai and other cities in the state.
 
 "I created sand art on beaches in Maharashtra to drive home the point of Swachh Bharat. I also joined hands with several volunteers and cleaned the beaches. We got a good response from tourists as well," he said.
