VIJAYAWADA: The rising number of suicides is worrying law enforcement agencies, a problem which global experts say can be avoided through counselling and support. Worryingly, there has also been a rise in cases where parents kill their children before committing suicide. Such case have been reported more from Prakasam, Krishna, Kadapa, Guntur, West Godavari and Nellore districts. 

 Marital   and financial crises are usually the reason behind such incidents, say sources. Last week, a 25-year-old woman killed her three-year-old daughter by feeding her poison-laced milk. Later, she hanged herself at her home in Ganapavaram village of Rajupalem mandal in Guntur district. The police said the mother, identified as  , had a failed marriage. The woman and her husband had frequent fights during the past few months.
 
 Also, police cite rise in suicide pact cases. Two years ago, a family of four committed suicide after their jewellery business went bankrupt in   area of Vijayawada. Speaking to TOI, M Sasi Kiran, a Vijayawada-based clinical psychologist, said people who have low tolerance for stress, and have increased frustration, tend to take such extreme step. Experts say counselling goes a long way in helping deal with stress, and avoid such incidents. They say there is no shame in asking for help when one is under stress.
 
 Kiran told TOI: “Many people endure a financial, familial and health issues, while bringing up children. Then there are a few who wrongly think that taking extreme steps solves problems.” 
 
 There are also instances where children have been killed by one of their parents as an act of revenge over extra-marital affairs, or other domestic issues.
