PANCHKULA:   administration’s and cops’ failure in managing   and traffic has been leading to inconvenience and harassment to thousands of residents of Panchkula and Chandigarh, especially the commuters, on a regular basis.

 A large number of commuters pass through the   that connects Chandigarh and Panchkula. The entire stretch is blocked every time a protest breaks out due to which commuters are left with no option but to take another route. 
 
 After residents complained about the harassment caused to them to the Panchkula commissioner of police A S Chawla, a meeting was called to solve the issue. Traffic diversion is the only idea that has been implemented so far. The idea to designate protesters at a single place in Sector 5 was also discussed but nothing on ground has been changed.
 
 Resident welfare association members said Panchkula police have not been able to limit the movement of protesting groups to Sector 5. President of citizen welfare association,  , said he has written several letters to the cops as well as to the administration. Nayar said, “I don’t know why cops are afraid to stop protesters from moving from one designated place. If they are stopped from moving, the residents would feel safer and there would be no harassment.”
 
 “This is not for the first time. It always happens when there is a protest. Why are we suffering when we are hardly at fault?” said Rajeev Mathur, a resident of Panchkula, who works at a private firm in Chandigarh. He complained of getting stuck regularly in traffic jams there.
 
 Residents were of the view that in the name of efforts, cops have only been able to divert the traffic towards Sector-17/18 roundabout heading to  , which becomes a mess during peak hours.
 
 Meanwhile, Panchkula police said they are working on devising new ideas to solve the issues. 
 
 On Wednesday as well, protesters reached at housing board light point and the way was once again blocked for the general public.
