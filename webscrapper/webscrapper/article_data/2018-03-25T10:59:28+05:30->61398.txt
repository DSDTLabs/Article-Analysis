INDORE: A 50-year-old man was allegedly beaten to death by his daughter and her 42-year-old female friend late Friday night. The accused were trying to cremate the body when police arrived after being alerted by neighbours and relatives. 

 Police have arrested 21-year-old   and her friend, Sonu Shukla, for murder. Police sources say that Preeti's father Devendra did not approve of her sexual orientation and this led to daily fights.
 
 Devendra was allegedly beaten to death at home in Narbal square of Sanwer during a quarrel on Friday night. Neighbours have told police that Preeti and her father had been quarreling for a long time before "they saw Preeti and her friend beat him up".
