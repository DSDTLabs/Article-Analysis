One of the aims of the   (WCC) during its formation was that every film set would have a sexual harassment committee, which any member of the film can approach, if they face any such issues.

 When questioned about this, members of the WCC say that it can be done only with the help of the various film organisations in the industry, implying that there hasn't been co-operation so far. "  has shown their co-operation by forming a women's wing of the organisation.   and the producers' association should follow suit. We are trying to move legally now." 
 
  Meanwhile, WCC members also observed that they have wasted a lot of time explaining themselves to 'fans'.
