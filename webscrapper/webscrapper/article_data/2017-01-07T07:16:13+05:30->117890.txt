BATHINDA: The SAD gave tickets for the   to two Congress leaders on the day they joined the party. Former MLA Surinderpal Singh Sibia and newcomer Amit Rattan joined the ruling party on December 24 and 25, respectively.

 Such was the rush for inducting the Congress leaders for SAD, which has suffered a number defections ahead of the latest state polls, that its president Sukhbir Badal organized a press conference at his official deputy CM residence in Chandigarh to announce Rattan’s nomination from Bathinda. Sibia, who has contested on a Congress ticket four times and won only in 2007, was announced as the SAD’s Barnala contestant in its list of three candidates announced on December 24. He had joined the party on the same day.
 
 Now on the other side of the fence, the two leaders have taken on the Congress leadership. The party, on the other hand, has called the duo opportunistic. While Rattan had been seeking the Congress ticket from Shutrana, Sibia wanted the party to nominate him from Sangrur. “I gave more than 30 years to the Congress. Still, it pushed me to Barnala assembly in 2002. When I made contacts in Barnala, the party asked me to move to Sangrur in 2007 and won from there. Now again, the party was asking me to move to Sunam. This was not acceptable to me. So, I resigned from Congress and joined SAD,” said Sibia. 
 
 Rattan, an engineering graduate, said Congress leadership had been promised the party’s ticket from Shutrana. “A few differences cropped up with   president   after he had failed to fulfil his promise of giving me a ticket. So, I joined SAD. I am in politics not to grab power or mint money, but to serve people and for that I found Akali Dal to be the best choice," he said.
