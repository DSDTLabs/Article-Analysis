MUMBAI:  , a student of  's  , met with a car accident four months before her board exams. Yet, she managed to score an impressive 89.6%. She was returning to her Belapur residence from tutorials with her mother who was driving the car when the accident took place. The car's brakes failed and it went under a bus. 

 "We had changed the car's tyres that morning and the brakes must have come loose," said Bhoomi, who suffered injuries to her back, hands and ribs. When her CT scans were cleared, she was allowed to go home but was told to take bed rest for one and a half months. She had to miss school classes as well as tuitions for that period. 
 
 Bhoomi studied on her own and got her doubts and queries clarified by her teachers. "I was depressed after the accident but my principal and teachers motivated me. They even held extra classes when I needed them," she said. 
 
 Though she managed to recover before exams, her hand injury affected her performance. "While I was able to study theory subjects, others like maths and accounts required written practice. Also, I had to use a writer during my exams," she added.
 
 The teenager now plans to study bachelor of management studies and is extremely happy with her marks.
