, who became a father to a pair of twins via surrogacy last month, finally took home his newborns,   and  , yesterday. As the twins were born premature, they had to spend seven weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of a suburban Mumbai hospital. According to the reports,   might have to hold back on throwing a welcome party for his children for a while though.

  
  
 According to reports, the filmmaker has been recommended to take the kids to hospital for periodic check-ups, since babies have lower immunities. In case of premature births, extra precaution is necessary.
 
 The reports suggested that the children, who were born two-and-half months premature, weighed less than 1.5 kilos at birth. In the past 51 days, their weight has reportedly almost doubled.
 
 Regular check-ups will help in monitoring their growth and any deficiencies that they may be born with also need to be detected. Karan will have to keep a check on the number of guests that he receives, as newborns are susceptible to infection.
 
 Friends of the filmmaker are expected to start dropping in to pay a visit to him and the kids, but reports suggest that no one will be allowed to meet the babies for a month. A nurse has also been appointed to be by the kids’ side. Karan’s mother   is also reportedly posting herself around the babies 24/7.
