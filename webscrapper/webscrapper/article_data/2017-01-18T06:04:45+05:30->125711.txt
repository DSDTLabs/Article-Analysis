CHANDIGARH: Draw of lots for admission in elementary classes began on Tuesday. On day one, St Kabir School in Sector 26 and   in Sector 32 conducted draw of lots. St Kabir opened 42 out of 90 seats in the general and preferred categories. Saupins opened 43 out of 85 seats for the general category. Wednesday will be a high-strung day for parents with four missionary schools holding draw of lots.

 St Kabir offered eight seats under the Sikh minority category, 33 to siblings, six to alumni and one to ward of staff. Saupins School reserved six seats under the management quota, offering 79 seats (including preferred categories). Out of these, they gave one seat under the Christian minority category, 32 under siblings and three to children of staff.
 
 "I have filled forms for some other schools as well, but not being selected in the very first draw has lowered confidence levels. There should be more seats in the general category," said Richa Gupta, a parent at St Kabir School.
 
 While the draw of lots took place peacefully in both schools, hundreds of parents were left disappointed when their children did not get a seat in schools of their choice. "My anxiety levels have risen and I feel helpless since it's all a matter of destiny. My fingers are crossed," said Kanchan, a parent whose daughter did not make it at Saupin's school.
 
 However, parents at St Kabir school were relieved because the school offered more seats under the general category this time. In 2015, there were only 29 out of 90 seats were offered in the general category. In 2016, 40 were open for nursery classes.
 
 On Wednesday St John's High School (all boys), Carmel Convent School (all girls), Sacred Heart School (all girls) and St Anne's Convent School (co-educational) will conduct draw of lots. They are also known for opening few seats in the general category.
