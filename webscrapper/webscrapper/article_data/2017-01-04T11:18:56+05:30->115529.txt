LUCKNOW: In a game-changer, private   of of   seeking   will now have to adhere to a set of rules and regulations laid down by the  . Also, colleges will have to ensure adjustment of their students in other affiliated colleges of  . There are close to 4 lakh students studying in 600-plus institutions in Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 UP’s technical education department has for the first time framed a policy for private engineering institutions seeking instant and complete closure. To shut down, institutes will have to provide branch-wise details of students enrolled, their category along with scholarship details, amount earned from students’ tuition fee and other fee, salary of teaching and non-teaching staff and court cases if any pending against the institution. Furnishing all details, the institute may apply for closure online and provide a hard copy to the government. 
 
  secretary technical education Monika Garg said, “There was no record of the number of institutions closing down every year citing shortage of students as reason. Each institution was doing it individually. All they did was move an application to the university without furnishing any details. The biggest concern was adjustment of their students in other institutions, so a need for the policy was felt.’’
 
 As many as 90% engineering seats remained vacant in the state for academic session 2016-17. There are hardly any takers for branches like computer sciences, civil and mechanical engineering in the state colleges. 89% seats are lying vacant in mechanical and civil engineering streams, while only 23% candidates confirmed admission to computer science branch of engineering. 
 
 Institutes desirous of closing down from academic session 2017-18 must apply online latest by January 31. Post no objection from the university and the state government, the institute will have to seek ‘instant closure’ approved by the statutory body (Executive Council). Following this, the government will permit the institue to shut shop. The government will not give recognition to such colleges for the next five years.
 
 AKTU will have to, latest by February 28, foward the application after proper verification and comments to the state government. In case of non-receipt of applications till February 28, the government will consider the college, in consonance with the university, will participate in the counselling process for admissions for academic session 2017-18. 
 
 Both—institutions seeking closure and those in which the students will be accommodated—will have to bear the difference in tuition and other fee, which will also be specified in an undertaking given by the accommodating institution. In case of colleges seeking progressive closures, they will have to ensure completion of course before shutting down.
