MUMBAI: The   ( ) may be the  's billion-dollar baby, but it has also cost the world's richest cricket body a packet.

 
 A reliable source told TOI on Wednesday that BCCI has paid around Rs 3,500 crore as tax since the financial year 2007-08. Since 2008-when IPL made its debut-the income tax department has refused to grant an exemption to the board, terming the annual tournament a commercial activity. At a rough estimate, BCCI has earned around Rs 12,000 crore from its popular league till date.
 
 "Earlier, BCCI would get a tax exemption since it was considered a charitable organisation. However, after IPL began, the I-T department has changed its tune, saying IPL is a commercial activity. It means that in the last ten years, we have paid tax to the tune of Rs 3,500 crore, or almost Rs 350 crore a year. We have paid up under protest and filed an appeal that we should be continued to be assessed as a nonprofit body that promotes cricket," the source said, adding that the board has also challenged the 30% tax demand in the income tax appellate tribunal (ITAT) besides filing a writ petition in the Bombay high court. It hopes to recover the tax paid if it's decided that it is entitled to I-T exemption.
 
 Apparently, the BCCI's listed objective (in its memorandum of association) is "growth and development of cricket in India". Its argument in this case is that "  cricket/IPL is different, but at par with Test and ODI cricket".
 
 
 
 
 In January, BCCI paid Rs 100 crores income tax, under protest, to the I-T department for the financial year 2013-14. "It's against the regular assessment for FY 2013-14. Although we've got a stay against the balance amount, we paid the net amount under protest without prejudice. It means we haven't accepted it, and have gone in appeal in ITAT," said the source.
