CHENNAI: Concluding four years of   over the world wide negative rights of ‘Kadhal Mannan’ ‘Gemini’ Ganesan-starrer Tamil film ‘Karpagam’, the Madras high court has declared AVM Film Studios as the absolute owner.

 This apart, Justice M Sundar has also allowed the Studios to claim damages for infringement of their right from Amarjothi Movies, AVM Limited, and two others.
 
 ‘Karpagam’ released in 1963, features   Ganesan, Savithri, S V Ranga Rao, M R Radha, K R Vijaya and Muthuraman as artists, produced and directed by K S Gopalakrishnan. Amarjothi Movies was the sole proprietor of the movie.
 
 While so, on February 4, 2013 Amarjothi Movies issued a notice to   claiming that the negative rights of the movie which was given to AVM Limited since 1964 expires on August 13, 2013. The notice also instructed AVM Limited to transfer and entrust the negative to Amarjothi.
 
 Disputing the contentions, AVM Studios sent a reply on March 11, 2013 stating that the world wide negative rights of the film is owned by them and not AVM Limited, that too for 99 years expiring on October 31, 2062.
 
 As Amarjothi refused to accept the claim, AVM Studios moved a civil suit in the high court.
 
 During the hearing it came out that Amarjothi took a loan of Rs 4 lakh from AVM Limited and in 1964 it had assigned the entire world negative rights absolutely in favour of AVM Limited for 99 years and transferred the negatives in their favour. Thereafter, AVM Limited assigned the rights of the film without any reservation whatsoever to G Sankaran in 2005. Subsequently, through a letter of arrangement in 2006, Sankaran assigned the rights to AVM Films Studios without any limitation. tnn
