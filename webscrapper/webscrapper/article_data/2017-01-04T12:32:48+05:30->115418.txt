PUNE: Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) officials say that funds have been set aside for what they call an “urgent overhaul” of all   in its jurisdiction.

 Many of these traffic signals have become non-functional over time and require traffic police personnel to manage traffic manually. Some of these signals are also not in sync with the revised traffic plans. Cantonment roads see traffic snarls almost every day at all the major intersections.
 
 PCB officials maintain, however, that this   is routine. “This is a maintenance drive that we conduct every year to look after the working of the traffic signals. It is true that some of the traffic signals are either not working or need modifications, but we coordinate with the traffic police on a regular basis to sort issues out,” says an official of the electrical department of the PCB.
 
 Officials also added that based on the flood of complaints they have received on the traffic situation in the Cantonment, they are mulling adding more traffic signals.
 
 “Due to newly developed areas on the edges of the Cantonment, few roads there have recently become prone to huge traffic snarls and accidents. We have received lots of complaints about the traffic issues there and about the absence of signals or traffic police. We cannot solve this unilaterally. Instead, we are planning a joint survey with senior traffic police officials to find spots and intersections where traffic can be regulated using signals, and that should be completed over the next few months,” a senior official of the PCB says.
 
 
 
 
 The PCB said it will organise its second annual marathon on January 15, a Sunday. Titled Run For Nation-2017, it has been backed by corporate sponsors, and the race length has been decided according to age groups and disabilities, varying between one to five kilometres. Forms are available on the PCB website.
