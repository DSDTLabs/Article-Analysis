NAVI MUMBAI: Two   board   are to be commissioned by the NMMC education department from the next academic year. 

 During the budget presentation, mayor Sudhakar Sonawane had suggested that the administration should consider having at least two CBSE schools in Airoli and Belapur.
 
 “The steep fees levied by private schools deter parents from the lower middle class from sending their wards to other boards. Even the mayor had sought for starting schools affiliated to other boards. Hence, on a pilot basis two CBSE board schools will be started,”said education officer Sandeep Sangave.
 
 A newly-constructed building in sector 15 of Nerul is one of the places where NMMC intends to set up a school. They are also considering buildings in Koparkhairane. 
 
 “The Pune municipal corporation has already taken a lead in this regard and it has been a success,” said mayor Sudhakar Sonawane. The proposal was approved by the General Body on Tuesday but NMMC’s failure to maintain quality in state board schools was questioned. 
 
 “It is a commendable initiative by the NMMC but at the same time it needs to be address issues faced by state board schools,” said former mayor Manisha Bhoir.
