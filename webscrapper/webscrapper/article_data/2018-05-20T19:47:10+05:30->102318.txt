PUNE: When four teams vie for two spots, the key is always in numbers. And to Kings XI Punjab's dismay, numbers don't seem to favour them when they take on 'hosts' Chennai Super Kings at the MCA Stadium in Gahunje on Sunday.

 
 
 
 With 12 points and a net run-rate of -0.490, KXIP are as it is behind the race. Even a big win against CSK may not be enough because both Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders have a better NRR than Ashwin's team. If Mumbai Indians win their match against Delhi Daredevils, they, too, will have 14 points and their NRR, too, will be much superior to KXIP's.
 
 
 
 Still, the Punjab side has something to play for while all CSK need to do is to not lose by too big a margin to stay in top-2. They were below-par in their loss against Delhi Daredevils and skipper   would like his team to bounce back before the business end. In fact, the KXIP game can be a good platform for the CSK management to brush up the problem areas like death bowling before they go into the play-offs.
 
 While CSK's form has been a little up and down in the last few games, KXIP have lost six of their last seven matches and have dropped from third to seventh position in the table.
 
 Ironically, they have the Orange and Purple cap holders in   (652 runs) and Andrew Tye (24 wickets) respectively, but rest of their players, but for Chris Gayle in the initial stages, have been unable to make substantial contributions.
 
 Kings XI coach Brad Hodge acknowledged their over-reliance on a couple of players. "I think realistically, our middle-order hasn't fired as much we would have expected and we are too reliant on a couple of bowlers who have kept us in the game. We haven't had consistency across the whole  . When our matchwinners didn't fire, nobody else was able to pick up the pieces," Hodge said.
