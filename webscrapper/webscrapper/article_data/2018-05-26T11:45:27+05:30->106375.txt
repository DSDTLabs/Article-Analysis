PATNA: The   (BSPCB) has identified 84 e-waste collection centres which are not complying with the E-waste (Management) Rules, 2016 notified by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate.

 “There are more than 140 authorised e-waste collection centres in the state. At least 84 of them are not complying with the rules,” a BSPCB official said.
 
 The BSPCB officials held a meeting with the heads of various collection centres and manufacturers of electrical products on Friday to inform them about proper e-waste management techniques.
 
 As per the E-waste Management Rules, 2016, the manufacturers of electrical products are required to set up collection centres and ensure that waste is recycled and disposed of in an environment-friendly manner. These collection centres and recyclers are registered with the state pollution control board. A deposit-refund system (DRS) has also been initiated where an upfront deposit is charged from the consumer at the time of purchase of the product and the deposit is refunded when the product is safely returned to the producer.
