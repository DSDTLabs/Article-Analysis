GURGAON: The district authorities have yet again failed to carry out a fresh demarcation of plots in the Gwalpahari area, where a private builder is allegedly carrying out construction on the bed of kost nullah (drain).

 Officials claimed that they did not have the require manpower to conduct the fresh demarcation, which has been pending for several months now.
 
 Sources said the demarcation was scheduled for April 8, but was postponed to April 13 (Thursday) apparently due to shortage of staff. However, on Thursday, the authorities cancelled the drive again on the same pretext, but this time they have not given any fresh date for the demarcation process.
 
 Local residents, who have been demanding this demarcation since last year, lambasted the authorities for their lackadaisical attitude. “We all had gathered at the site to see the demarcation process. In fact, some of us took off from work. However, MCG officials claimed that since most of the staffers were in Chandigarh, preparing for a court case, the demarcation cannot take place today,” said Vaishali  , who has been fighting this case in the   as well.
 
 Chandra, a resident of   society, alleged the nullah, which begins at Gwalpahari and passes through Baliyawas and   before emptying into the Badshapur drain, had been encroached upon by a private builder,  , blocking the natural flow.
 
 MCG officials claimed that the demarcation would now be done after the court hearing in a land-related case next week.
