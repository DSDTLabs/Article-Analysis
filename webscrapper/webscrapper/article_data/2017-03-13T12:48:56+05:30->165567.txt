LUCKNOW: Split in Muslim votes and Hindu consolidation in BJP's favour led to saffron surge in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections. Further, only 24 Muslim candidates could win elections. Results declared on Saturday also indicated that   was the first choice of Muslims despite Mayawati going all out to woo minority community. 

 The BSP gave tickets to 99 Muslim candidates, highest ever by any mainstream party in UP since Independence. She also got Mukhtar Ansari's Quami Ekta Dal merged with the BSP and took support from Muslim-dominated Rashtriya Ulama Council. Several Muslim outfits also appealed in BSP's favour. However, results show that of 140 assembly constituencies where Muslim population is 20% or above, BJP won 109 and its ally Apna Dal 2, SP won 23 and its ally Congress 3, while BSP got 2. This pollsters said indicates Muslims chose SP-Congress alliance over BSP.
 
 These 140 seats are said to be key in winning UP elections. In 2012, when SP came to power with majority, it won 72 at constituencies, BSP 27 seats, BJP 25, Congress 11, RLD 1 and others four. In 2007, BSP had swept 40% of the total seats and also won elections.
 
 Though Muslims constitute 19% of UP's population, this time there will be drastic drop in their representation in the state assembly with only 24 (6% of the total 403 seats) candidates from the community winning elections. In 2012, total 69 Muslim candidates (17.12%), highest since independence, reached assembly and in 2007, 46% (11.90%). In 2012 and 2007, caste equations dominated elections, besides other issues. The lowest Muslim representation in state assembly was 16 (4.05% of the total 419 seats then) in 1991 when communal polarization took place due to Ram Temple movement and BJP came to power for the first time in the state with absolute majority. In 1993, in the elections held after Babri mosque demolition, only 24 (5.92%) Muslim candidates won.
 
 Analysts said that Muslim representation always comes down whenever there is polarization on religious lives. In 1967 and 1969 when Gau Rakshan movement was at its peak, only 23 Muslims won elections on both occasions in UP.
 
 In this elections, Mayawati's political engineering to bring together Dalit and Muslims failed as only five Muslim candidates out of total 99 fielded by the BSP, could win their seats. SP had given tickets to 57 Muslims, of which 17 won, while Congress fielded 22 Muslims, of which only two won. In 2012, of 78 Muslim candidates fielded by SP, 43 won, while of 85 Muslims fielded by BSP, 16 won. Congress gave tickets to 62 Muslims, but four won. Two Muslims candidates won on Quami Ekta Dal.
