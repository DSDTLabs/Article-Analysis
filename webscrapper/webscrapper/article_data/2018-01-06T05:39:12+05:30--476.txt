 Some men had pelted stones and damaged vehicles at the gathering of dalits in Koregaon Bhima on January 1 to mark the 200-year-old battle of at Koregaon Bhima. 
 
 The senior officer, associated with the probe, said, “We won't take a call on arresting Ekbote and Bhide unless we come across clear evidence about their roles in the violence. From the video and audio clips examined till Friday afternoon, we have not come across such evidence.” Investigators have nearly 600 video and audio clips for scrutiny.
 
 The rural police have adopted a more circumspect approach. The officer said, “On Thursday evening, a team of Rural police had gone to arrest a suspect after confirming his involvement in the January 1 violence. When our vehicles reached, all the villagers gathered near the suspect’s house and did not allow the team to take the suspect into custody.”
