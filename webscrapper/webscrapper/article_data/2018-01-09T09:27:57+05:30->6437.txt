LUCKNOW: Cracks appeared in the much talked about   against the   as the   announced on Monday that it would reassess its alliance with the   ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

 The announcement came two days after the Congress skipped a joint opposition meeting convened by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav to draw a strategy for the upcoming bypolls on two Lok Sabha seats, Gorakhpur and Phulpur, vacated by chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, respectively.
 
 The issue of alliance with the Congress was also raised during SP’s internal meeting headed by Akhilesh in Lucknow on Monday. The meeting was mainly attended by SP MLAs and party candidates who contested 2017 UP elections on SP ticket.
 
 SP chief spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary confirmed to TOI that the party will review Congress’ performance on 105 seats which were given to it during 2017 assembly elections. “The assembly seats which were given to the Congress will now be assembly segments of various Lok Sabha seats from where SP would like to field its candidates. Those seats need to be reviewed and a decision taken accordingly,” Chaudhary told TOI.
 
 “The Congress has already decided not to ally with any party, including the SP. If SP says it is analyzing performance on various seats, so is the Congress. However, when a decision needs to be taken, the state and central leadership will take it jointly,” Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh told TOI.
