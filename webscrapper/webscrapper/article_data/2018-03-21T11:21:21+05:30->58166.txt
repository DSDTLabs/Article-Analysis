PANAJI: After outline development plans (ODPs) for Margao and Ponda were withdrawn some months ago, the   (SGPDA) has initiated the process to draw up the existing land use map for both towns.

 An order to go ahead with this preliminary step that facilitates preparation of ODPs has been issued by chief town planner (CTP) of town and country planning (TCP) department.
 
 This follows TCP minister Vijai Sardesai’s announcement of an intended decision to scrap all ODPs that were either finalized or were in the process of being finalized. Sardesai had told reporters in February 2018 that barring Margao, some ODPs had been drafted without following due process. The ODPs of Panaji, Vasco, Mapusa and Calangute-Candolim were listed as mentioned in this category.
 
 The Calangute-Candolim ODP has now been put in the public domain for suggestions and objections while the plan for Vasco has been scrapped.
 
 The ODP for Margao was one which generated intense heat and controversy. Activists had alleged that it was riddled with errors while some had alleged that Margao municipal council (MMC) had not been taken into confidence in breach of TCP laws.
 
 Agricultural, tenanted lands and no-development zones (NDZ) had been shown as settlement or commercial zones. The slopy NDZ area of Moti Dongor with shanties, land which largely belongs to Margao comunidade, has been marked as settlement zone. The NDZ of 0-100m along River Sal, comunidade lands, buffer zone for Konkan railway, sewerage lines and other details were also not shown in it.
 
 A public notice issued by SGPDA for both towns states, “The land use map and register shall show the present land use in the prescribed form indicating the present use of every piece of land in the planning area.”
