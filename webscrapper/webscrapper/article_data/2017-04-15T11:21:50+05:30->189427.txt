PANAJI: Goa should consider using interactive boards and e-content to   in science and mathematics, Union human resource development (HRD)   suggested to state officials at the   meeting for   for 2016-17 held last year. 

 Goa was told that from academic year 2016-17 all primary school students should score at least 40% in each subject. Central government officials expressed concern about the low scores of Goa students in the National Achievement Survey (NAS) carried out for Classes III, V and VIII. 
 
 “The state should conduct NAS for every student every year and set a benchmark for teachers to improve scores and provide remedial teaching to students with low scores,” the minutes of last year’s meeting show.
 
 Goa officials said that the state was facing a shortage of subject-specific teachers in mathematics and science in upper primary schools (Classes V to VIII).
 
 HRD officials asked Goa to provide training to math and science teachers who are already employed in schools and do not have an academic background in the two subjects.
 
 “For Classes I to VIII the target for 2016-17 to be achieved in the State Achievement Survey (SAS) and National Achievement Survey (NAS) is that all children will score 40% or above in all subjects. The state will go through the NCERT in detail, NAS findings for the state for Classes III, V and VIII, and take corrective action as well as disseminate these findings amongst all elementary school teachers so that they improve their performance,” HRD officials told Goa as per the minutes of last year’s meeting.
 
 In 2015, for the first time Class X students' learning levels were also assessed.
