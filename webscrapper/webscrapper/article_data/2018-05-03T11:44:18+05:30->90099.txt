HYDERABAD: The world’s second largest banyan tree at   in   district of  , which was put on insecticide saline drip, is now out of ‘critical state,’ forest officials said.

 
 Officials said they would soon start using biopesticide as the termites that infested the tree from roots to stem and branches have been controlled significantly.
 
 Mahabubnagar District Forest Officer   told TOI, “The tree has recovered well. Following advice from experts, we followed the procedures and injected diluted chemical   to kill the termite population that infested the tree. There is no harmful effect of injecting Chloropyrifos on the tree. We are not shifting to the use of biopesticide as the termite population is under control. The temporary concrete structures built to give strength to the stem will be removed as soon as the prop roots of the banyan tree get strength. Our focus is on strengthening the prop roots,”
 
 The 700-year-old ficus tree was treated using saline bottles as parts of it are fallen, and it was closed for tourists in December 2017. The tree was given diluted Chlorpyrifos after efforts to push the insecticide into the stem by keeping holes failed.
