LUCKNOW: Not entirely convinced with the latest crackdown, Shravan Sahu’s family said that only a   inquiry can put speculation to rest in his murder case. Shravan, who owned an oil mill and a chemist store was killed allegedly at the behest of Aqeel Ansari, a listed criminal from Thakurganj area.

 Shravan’s elder son Ayush was murdered in October, 2013 outside a beer shop located at   in Thakurganj. Aqeel and Ayush had a confrontation over buying beer after which Aqeel had fired four shots at Ayush, killing him on the spot. Shravan was pursuing his son’s murder case and fighting it out against Aqeel before he was killed on February 1.
 
 Shravan’s second son Suneet is the only male member left behind and has to shoulder the entire responsibility now. It was Suneet who lodged the FIR at   police station on the night of February 1 after his 61-year-old father was murdered. His uncles and Shravan’s younger brothers Vijay and Vinay had seen the killers before they escaped. 
 
 “We were not informed about the arrest of three people. My uncles could have identified the killers but they were not contacted. We have no faith in Lucknow police as they have earlier tried to frame my father in a fake criminal case. We have our hopes pinned on a CBI inquiry and believe only an independent agency can nail Aqeel,” said Suneet. The Sahu family said they were not asked to identify the killers in person.
