NEW DELHI: Defending champions   and   have won a   silver in the women’s doubles squash, losing 0-2 to New Zealand’s Joelle King and Amanda Landers-Murphy in the gold medal match on Sunday at Gold Coast, Australia. 

 
 
 Joshna and Dipika, who four years ago in Glasgow created history when they overcame the odds to upset the top-seeded English pair of Jenny Duncalf and Laura Massaro to win the squash women's doubles gold medal, were beaten in straight games 9-11, 8-11 and claimed India’s 64th medal of the Gold Coast Games. 
 
 The pair marched into today’s match after beating England’s Laura Massaro and Sarah-Jane Perry 2-0 a day earlier, and failed to beat their Kiwi opponents who did not lose a single game all through the CWG. 
 
 Dipika, 26, had on Saturday won silver in the mixed doubles with Saurav Ghosal.
