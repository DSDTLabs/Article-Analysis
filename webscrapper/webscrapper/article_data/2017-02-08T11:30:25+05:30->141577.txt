GUWAHATI: From roping in international star   as the state's tourism brand ambassador to proposing to set up a three-star resort in Majuli, the world's biggest river island and the seat of Assam's Vaishnavite culture, the state government left no stone unturned to take   to newer heights. 

 "Assam is known for its hospitality. We have taken a number of initiatives in this important, revenue-earning sector. The tourist inflow to the state has increased significantly," Sarma said in his opening remarks on tourism development.
 
 Finance minister  , who also holds the tourism portfolio, promised 24x7 power supply in principal tourist destinations of the state. He also announced that the state government would tie up with IRCTC to start ropeway services between   and Kamakhya Temple.
 
 Sarma not only refrained from imposing any new taxes, but also got rid of luxury tax on hotels and lodging houses, including rural homestays. To attract tourists looking to experience rural life in the state, Sarma allotted Rs 3 crore for a special scheme called 'Amar Alohi' (our guest) to develop rural homestays. "We need to boost the tourism industry, especially the ecological and botanical potential of our state. For this, we have already launched a programme to encourage homestays in Assam. We therefore propose to exempt hotels and lodging houses, including rural homestays, from paying luxury tax," Sarma said.
 
 To help tourists from Assam visit other parts of the country, Sarma proposed to send 15,000 pilgrims to Puri, Vrindavan, Ajmer Sharif and other important religious spots through IRCTC. For this, he earmarked Rs 10 crore.
