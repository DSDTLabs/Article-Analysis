Metabolic syndrome [MetS] is a cluster of abnormalities such as high  , obesity, and diabetes all occurring together. As many studies have shown that it is an important risk factor for cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease and renal failure and hence an important cause of morbidity and mortality. It is possible to pick up the possible victims of metabolic syndrome right from their early childhood. This can be done by ascertaining the presence of certain risk factors in children at their tender age. A study conducted in Brazil and published in the journal 
  made an attempt to identify the risk factors that would help establish the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome right in childhood. 

 The team of researchers determined the blood pressure, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, fasting blood glucose and waist circumference of 505 school-going children [age; 6-10 years]. Variation in the normal range of BP, triglycerides,   or fasting blood glucose was considered as a risk factor for metabolic syndrome. Nearly 61% of the school children, more frequently the overweight/obese ones had at least one of these risk factors. While near-to 35% of the study population had at least one risk factor, 21% and 5% of them had two and three risk factors, respectively. In all the cases, being overweight or obese, increased the childâ€™s vulnerability for developing a risk factor.
 Cutting down of the chubby childhood fat and attenuating various risk factors is therefore important to keep metabolic syndrome at bay in future.
 
 
 With changing lifestyle prevalence of metabolic syndrome is increasing worldwide, especially in India at such an earlier age compared to developed countries. Early detection and treatment of these risk factors prevents cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and renal failure significantly.
