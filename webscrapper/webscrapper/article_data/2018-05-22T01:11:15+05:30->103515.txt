Jaipur: Showing sincerity and honesty while performing his duties, an on-duty train ticket examiner at the Chandigarh-Jaipur Rath returned a bag containing a good amount of money and expensive items to a woman passenger. The passenger after getting off the train on Sunday at Jaipur Junction realized that she left her bag in the coach in which she was travelling and that’s when she appealed to the railway administration to find her bag. 

 Dr Megha Sharma boarded the train from Ambala Cantt. “While she got off at Jaipur she realized that her bag containing cash and other valuables was left inside coach G-3 seat no 16. She tweeted about it and urged an immediate intervention,” said Tarun Jain, chief public relations officer, NWR on Monday.
 
 Immediately after the message of the woman passenger, the control room intimated the train staff about the bag as the train had already left for Ajmer. “Poonam Chand the TTE assured the woman that she would get her bag. He contacted train conductor N S Rahore and urged him to take the bag back to Jaipur,” Jain added. 
 
 Megha, elated with the response thanked Piyush Goyal,   minister and other authorities.
