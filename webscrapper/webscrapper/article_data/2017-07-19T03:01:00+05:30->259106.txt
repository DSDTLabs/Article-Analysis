Ponda: As was the situation in several other parts of the state on Tuesday, fire and emergency personnel at Ponda, too, were kept on their toes clearing uprooted trees at several places within the town and villages in its vicinity. Station fire officer Sushil Morajkar said 11 incidents of trees falling were logged at the   fire station in less than a day. 

 Though there were neither any casualties nor major destruction to property, a tree that fell right across the road at Farmagudi blocked vehicular traffic for a considerable duration, Morajkar said. 
 
 Of the 11 incidents of uprooted trees that were reported, eight came from Ponda town, Patantali, Farmagudi, Tisk-Usgao, Dharbandora, Keri, Kawlem and Gaunem. While firefighters cleared 10 of the 11 trees, they put off one case by a day as the tree in question was found to be leaning on the gallery of a building at Khadapandh, thereby not posing much of a risk, Morajkar explained.
