MUMBAI: The   has asked the   ( ) to come up with a plan for raising funds from sources to meet the requirement for dining and hostel charges of students from SC/ST category, as was the case before.

 
 The commission made the recommendation in a hearing on May 16. In another hearing on Thursday, the commission asked the institute to not take any action against the students as the matter was still pending for hearing. This was with regards to the show-cause notice issued to 26 protesting students. 
 
 
 The commission observed that the funds raised by the institute should be utilized for meeting or minimising the expenditure on dining hall facility, hostel fee and other heads as students from the marginalized section are not in a position ‘to bear the enhanced financial burden’. It added that this should be done at the earliest to protect students’ interest. The commission has directed the ministry of human resource development and the   ( ) to find ways to support the ST students to ensure that they continue to study in TISS and other such institutes where the cost of education is higher than the postmatric scholarship received by them.
 
 The protesting students have demanded that the institute should not charge any dining hall fees from the students. The students also condemned the institutes’s move to issue show cause notices to them.
 
 A TISS official said they are yet to get a written communication from the commission on the hearing. The commission has asked the institute to submit a report.
