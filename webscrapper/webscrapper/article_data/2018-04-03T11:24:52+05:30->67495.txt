PUNE: Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh chief   on Monday blamed the “contradictory judgments” of the Supreme Court and subsequent “inaction” of the Centre for the violence that erupted in various states during the nationwide bandh called by Dalit outfits against the alleged dilution of the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

 Ambedkar told reporters that the SC, in the past, had passed judgments categorically stating that a police officer was duty-bound to register an FIR after a complaint was lodged. 
 
 “But in the case of complaints lodged under the Atrocities Act, the SC wants the police officer to first scrutinise the complaint and get it personally verified before registering an FIR. These   by the SC are responsible for today’s violence. The government must initiate action against such contradictory judgments by the SC,”   said.
 
 Ambedkar also accused the government of creating an “unsafe atmosphere” for the Dalit community in the country. Stating that he did not know who had given the call for Monday’s bandh, he said, “The messages about the bandh call were on social media, but the government failed to take cognisance of the unrest within the community.”
 
 The Dalit leader dismissed RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s recent statement that the outfit did not believe in excluding anyone from the nation-building process and said the RSS was an “organisation of liars”.
