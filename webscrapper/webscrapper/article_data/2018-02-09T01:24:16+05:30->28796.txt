MUMBAI: The   (WR) commuters were fuming on Thursday afternoon after a technical problem with the   between Mahalaxmi and Elphinstone Road stations led to delays. 

 Commuters had to wait for trains for nearly half an hour at stations like Borivali and Andheri. “It was frustrating as massive crowds had bunched at Andheri, specially from 1:30 pm to 2:05 pm. Only two trains had arrived,” said a commuter. Another commuter said that trains from Borivali were running with poor frequency, and this led to crowds on platforms.
 
 A WR official said that the technical problem with the overhead wire was resolved at the earliest and services were normalised.
