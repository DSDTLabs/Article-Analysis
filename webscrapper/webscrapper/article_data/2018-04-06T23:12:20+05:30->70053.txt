It is fair to say that   has really gone out of his way to lure The   to come back for one more match at Wrestlemania and while the   card still doesn’t feature either Cena or Taker, it is widely speculated that the Deadman will answer Cena’s call. 

 
 
 How he does that is a different matter altogether; but the build up to this dream match - if it was Wrestlemania 30 - has been phenomenal. After Wrestlemania 33 Taker had left his coat, hat and gloves in the middle of of the ring bidding an emotional goodbye - everybody thought that was it. 
 
 But his return to RAW for its 25th anniversary rekindled hopes and that was further fanned by Cena’s superior mic skills that has made this rivalry, right from scratch to the most talked about one, heading in to New Orleans. 
 
 While the Deadman character was ended at Wrestlemania 33 and considering the fact Taker’s an out and out old-school guy, it is highly unlikely that Mark Calaway will make the slow walk again, ever. 
 
 So what’s next - remember Biker Taker, the American Badass? It would be logical to retire that character as well and to do that against Cena could be ideal. 
 
 And just imagine Kid Rock - incidentally in the Hall of Fame this year - the man responsible for the American Badass theme performing for Taker one last time, just too good to be true, right? Well, as Vince McMahon, Triple H and Stephanie would say, anything can happen in  . 
 
 
 Then again, if there is anyone worthy - well capable enough - to make this rivalry work that was John Cena. One that note, here a look at Cenás history with Taker and his recent histrionics to attract Taker’s attention:
 
 
 
 
 The Undertaker in his American Badass persona eliminated John Cena from the first ever Royal Rumble.
