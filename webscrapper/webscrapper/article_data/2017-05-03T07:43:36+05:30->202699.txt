AHMEDABAD: Parents of a standard XI student have approached   police alleging harassment by a man. Sola police have started searching for the man on the basis of the phone number provided by the parents. According to police,   (name changed), a resident of Gota Road, Chandlodia, had enrolled for tuitions for standard XII at a class on the RC Technical Road.

 “On Monday, when she came out of the tuition class at 6.15 pm, she found a paper stuck on to her scooter’s speedometer with a phone number and ‘kirnas what-shup’ (sic) written on it,” said a Sola police official. “When she went home, she showed the paper to her mother. Her mother called that number and the man allegedly used abusive and degrading language.”
 
 The official said that when the man was threatened with a police complaint, he apologized. However, the family decided to press charges of harassment to prevent him harassing others in the future. Police lauded the family for not tolerating the misbehaviour.
