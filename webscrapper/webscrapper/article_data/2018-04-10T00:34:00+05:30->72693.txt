 Pune: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, under the leadership of MP Anil Shirole and guardian minister Girish Bapat, will observe a day-long fast on April 12 to protest the impasse in Parliament, for which the ruling party blamed the Congress and other opposition parties.
 
 The BJP came up with the agitation plan to counter Congress leaders’ day-long fast on Monday who protested against the Narendra Modi-led government’s failure in maintaining social harmony.
 
 Shirole, while explaining the reasons behind the fast, said it was an attempt to convey a message to the people that the Congress was indulging in negative tactics and did not allow the Parliament to function. The Parliament lost over 248 working hours because of the negative stand taken by the opposition parties, he said.
 
 “When we (BJP) were in the opposition and demanding a debate in Parliament over coal-gate and 2G spectrum scams, it was the Congress which did not allow any discussion. Now they (Congress) are in the opposition and still disturbing the proceedings in the Parliament,” he added.
 
 He claimed the BJP government has taken up crucial developmental works which were appreciated by the people. However, the opposition parties cannot digest BJP’s success hence indulging in negative politics, he said.
 
 Shirole said city unit president Yogesh Gogawale along with party’s leaders in the PMC, including mayor Mukta Tilak, will participate in the agitation.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress leaders on Monday observed a fast to protest against BJP’s failure to maintain harmony. The agitation was held at Alka Talkies chowk. 
 
 Ramesh Bagwe, Congress city unit chief said the agitation was a beginning of the fight against BJP’s plans to change the Constitution. The Congress party will take to the streets to protect the Constitution, he said.
