MUMBAI: Two community dogs were found writhing in pain outside a housing society in   (west) recently. One of the dogs admitted to the veterinary hospital in   died on Saturday. 

 "The dog had multiple fractures on various parts after being hit with a heavy stick or some other blunt object. It did not survive," said Lt Col J C Khanna of Bombay Society For Prevention Of Cruelty To Animals.
 
  A video of the two dogs posted on social media recently shows how the two canines could not even sit up after the attack . Also, the jaw of one of the dogs was broken and bleeding. 
 
  Khanna said they have no information about who beat up the dog. "If any animal caretaker or activist contacts us, I can send our animal inspectors to this housing society to investigate," said Khanna. 
 
 Animal activist Salim Charania said that the only information they have is that the two dogs were beaten up very badly at the behest of some locals. "Our volunteers are gathering details to lodge a police complaint," said Charania. "It is shocking that educated people living in posh places are cruelly trying to get rid of stray animals."
 
 Khanna said they get several a lot of complaints against housing societies from animal lovers. "We advise them to live in harmony with animals and tell them that sterilization of cats and dogs is the only humane and legal option to control their population," he said.
