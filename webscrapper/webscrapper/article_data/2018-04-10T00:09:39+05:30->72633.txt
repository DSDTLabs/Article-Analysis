THANE: The   on Monday stayed the Bombay high court’s order directing departmental action against police officers, including the Thane DCP, for arresting lawyer   in the illegal procurement of call data records (CDR) case.

 The Thane police had arrested Siddique for allegedly sourcing the CDRs of actor Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s wife. However, Siddique’s wife Tasneem challenged the arrest and filed a habeas corpus petition in the high court, which ordered his release. The state government then moved a special leave petition in the SC, challenging the HC order.
 
 The bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justice AM   heard the arguments made by senior advocate   and advocate Nishant Katneshwar, who appeared for the state government in the Supreme Court. Advocate CA Sundaram appeared for Siddique, said a police officer.
 
 The state sought a stay on the HC order that said the police had acted in a “high-handed” manner and had failed to follow “due process of law”. The bench had told to release Siddique and directed the seniormost officials of Thane police and the state home department to inquire into the actions of the cops. The HC had said that if deemed fit, appropriate punitive proceedings be initiated against officials concerned.
 
 The SC has issued a notice to Siddique and asked him to file his reply within four weeks. The matter will be heard on July 2.
