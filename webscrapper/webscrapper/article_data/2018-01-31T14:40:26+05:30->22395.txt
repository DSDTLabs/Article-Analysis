GURUGRAM: The sessions court on Tuesday extended the judicial remand of the Class XI student, detained for his alleged role in the September 8 murder of a seven-year-old boy inside a school campus in Gurugram’s   area, for another 13 days. 

 The juvenile will remain at the observation home in Faridabad till February 12.
 
 Ideally, the judicial remand should have been extended for 14 days (till February 13), but on the request of the juvenile’s counsel, the court extended the remand till February 12. 
 
 Explaining his request, juvenile’s counsel Sandeep Aneja said that Tuesdays and Fridays are the only two days when the parents can meet the boy at the observation home. 
 
 “If the remand ends on a Tuesday or Friday, it wouldn’t be possible for the parents to meet him as cops would be taking him to court for his physical appearance,” said Aneja. 
 
 However, the next hearing in the case is scheduled for February 2 which will be held in-camera.
 
  The chargesheet in the case is also expected to be filed by the end of this month as the 90-day deadline expires on February 8. CBI had detained the juvenile on November 7 and produced him before the   on November 8 from where he was sent to police remand till November 11. 
 
 On January 8, additional district sessions court JS Kundu, while rejecting the bail application of the juvenile, had barred media from not only revealing the identity of the suspect but also the victim, the school, witnesses and anything related to the investigation in the case. The court had provided alternative names — the juvenile is to be referred to as ‘Bholu’. The Class II student, who was murdered, as ‘Prince’ and the school to be referred as ‘Vidyalaya’— to be used in reportage of the case.
