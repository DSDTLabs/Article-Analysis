KOLKATA: As the city starts bidding farewell to Goddess Durga, some Kolkata households neighbouring top-draw Pujas this week heaved a sigh of relief.

 Cocooned in their homes for the past four days, many of them could finally step out after the traffic restrictions eased.
 
 More than 1,200 residents of VIP Terrace and Alcoff Gloria, barely 500m from Sree Bhumi, could access the footbridge leading to   only by jumping over the fence that had come up around the service road since Mahalaya. But that, too, was only till Saptami. After that, their lives got significantly more difficult because the footbridge was closed.Residents of Bangur Avenue and   rued the traffic restrictions on traffic on exit and entry to their respective homes.
 
 "We were cabined from Saptami," said Somnath Chakraborty ."We had to park our car at Salt Lake and walk the rest of the way." When asked whether they could get out to see pujas, Chakraborty shot back: "Forget enjoyment. We have a department store, but even that was closed and we couldn't even buy dai ly necessities".
 
 People in the neighbourhood of the major pujas like Bosepukur Sitala Mandir or   or   had similar stories.
 
 But the pain can be minimised, said Swaradendu Sarkar, who stays a stone's throwing from the Suruchi Sangha puja, another massive draw. "We have been provided residents' passes and can enter and exit whenever we like," he said.
 
 
 
 
 It's a horrible thing to be held prisoner, especially inside one's own home, and the pain must have been even more acute because this is the time of year when the entire city gets out on the streets.Organizers must issue residents' passes -like some have already done -to allow them free access to and from their homes.
