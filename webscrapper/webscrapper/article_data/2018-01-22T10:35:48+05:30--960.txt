Less than three days to the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s much-controversial movie ‘Padmaavat’ (originally titled ‘Padmavati’), the hue and cry over it seems far from over. While   refuted SLB’s call to watch the film, over 500   women marched from Jauhar Sthal at Chittorgarh fort to Jyoti Temple at Jauhar Smriti Sansthan premises on Sunday to register their protest against its release.

 Shatrani Manch has dropped the threat of carrying out self-immolation on January 24. Instead, they will file a petition to commit suicide at the apex court. Nirmala Rathore, joint secretary Shatrani Manch, reportedly said that they do not want to break the law which is why they have dropped the self-immolation bid and the call to commit 'jauhar'. The Shatranis are now reportedly exercising their freedom of expression by seeking permission to commit mass suicide.
 
  
  
 Manch members gathered at the historic Padal Pole and proceeded toward the Jauhar site, singing songs and raising slogans. At the Jauhar Sthal, the emotionally charged group of women raised slogans against Bhansali. The core members held swords while taking the pledge to not allow the release of the film. The Swabhiman Rally was held on Sunday following the SC order that struck down the ban on the film in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, and Haryana.
