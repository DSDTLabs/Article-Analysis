MANGALURU:   Shiroor Mutt seer  , who recently announced his decision to contest   from Udupi, said he will make the constituency a model one in the state, if elected. He asserted that his decision to contest elections is final.

 “I will contest as an independent candidate, if the   does not offer a party ticket. I will connect villages in Udupi by constructing new roads, provide all infrastructure and develop the constituency in an integrated manner. Construction of roads, basic facilities in villages, introduction of   buses, houses for the poor, quality education in government schools, upgradation of government hospitals and job opportunities for youths are our priority,” the seer said.
 
 “Many villages in Udupi constituency are reeling under a drinking water crisis. The constituency also has several major issues like sand crisis, problems of fishermen and homeless poor. Initiatives should be created for job creation by way of self-employment loans. Grievances of people with regard to obtaining house construction licence needs to be addressed. People are made to run from pillar to post to get their government work done and officials demand bribes,’’ the seer said, adding that his candidature is essential.
 
 “My contesting elections is final and it is to save spiritual centres that are facing injustice because of the government and a few people’s representatives. Thousands of voters have agreed to extend their support for my victory,” he added.
