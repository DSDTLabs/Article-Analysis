BATHINDA:   Congress vice-president Sunil Jakhar has urged the Union government not to allow the SAD-BJP government in Punjab to float bonds to legalize the alleged misappropriation of Rs 31,000 crore caused by siphoning off of food stocks from the state.

 In a statement issued on Thursday Jakhar said, “The state government is attempting to float bonds and put a liability on the people of the state for the next 20 years, which is a coverup operation.“
 
 “Not only should the   disallow floating of the bonds, but it must also probe the scam and fix the responsibility,“ Jakhar said, adding that the Punjab government had no locus standi as it had already outlived its term and a new government would be formed soon.
 
 Jakhar said Punjab food minister Adesh Partap Singh Kairon was claiming till September 2016 that the state had a dispute with the Centre over counter claims of Rs 27,000 crore. The senior   leader said if the Centre was not able to fix the responsibility, his party after forming the government in Punjab would ensure that the guilty were held accountable and their assets confiscated.
