JALANDHAR: Police officials faced embarrassing moment when amid their claims during a press conference, about arresting an accused from a police naka with charas, the accused countered them saying that he was picked up from his home.

  1   and ACP (north) Deepika Singh were jointly addressing a press conference. As they were giving details about the arrest of the accused, Madan Singh of   under NDPS Act, they said he was apprehended at Lama Pind Chowk police naka and 5kg charas was recovered from him.
 
 However, the accused standing behind the police officials said it was a lie as he was picked up from his residence. He said he was resident of Hardeep Nagar and not Togri Mohalla.
 
 Embarrassed officials asked the junior police official to take him away. This became an abrupt end of the press conference and left bad taste in the mouths of the officials.
