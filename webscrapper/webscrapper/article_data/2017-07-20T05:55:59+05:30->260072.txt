HYDERABAD: With questioning of   personalities having begun in the   on Wednesday, the Telugu film industry is on tenterhooks as to where this would lead.
Producer   said that the police should book them under Preventive Detention Act and arrest them. He said the film chamber should also impose a life time ban on them. “Only if such measures are taken, a strong signal will be sent that such activities will not be tolerated by the film industry,“ he added.
 
 Kumar told TOI it would be in the interest of the film industry to weed out drug addicts. He also said that in the past there have been instances of Tollywood getting involved with drugs but this time it has come like a 'bomb which has been dropped'. Several people related to the film industry have already expressed their anguish at Tollywood personalities being dragged into the drugs case.
 
 “The reputation of the film industry has been sullied, the film industry has got a bad name,“ veteran actor Kota Srinivas Rao said.   president   said that it has been made clear to everyone in the industry that whoever is being called for questioning should be honest with the officials.
