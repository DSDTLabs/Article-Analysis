CHENNAI: The two money laundering cases against   deputy general secretary   entered a crucial phase with the   (ED) opening its arguments for framing of charges against him on Monday. 

 When the cases came up for hearing before the economic offences court-II presided over by additional chief metropolitan magistrate S Malarmathi, the ED's senior prosecutor M Dhandpani opened his arguments as required under Section 244 of CrPC. With this, the ED's pleadings in the case is over, as all documents have already been marked, and all witnesses already examined.
 
 The case has now been posted to April 13 for Dhinakaran's side to offer their replies, if any. Now that RK Nagar bypolls has been cancelled, the case would witness some progress unless there is any intervention by the high court.
 
 Interestingly, on Monday, ED counsel Dhandapani read part of a letter written by Dhinakaran during his preventive detention under   in 1996 claiming that he was a non-resident Indian and that he intended to migrate to Singapore as a permanent resident. Excerpts from the letter had been widely quoted by Justice G Chockalingam in his order last month, setting aside discharge of Dhinakaran from ED proceedings and virtually reopening the case against him.
 
 Dhinakaran is facing two ED cases-while one pertains to illegal transfer of 1 crore US dollars to a company incorporated in  , the other case relates to illegal payment of 37 lakh US dollars to shell companies. Besides having served one-year detention under COFEPOSA, which was also upheld by the  , Dhinakrana had been slapped a penalty of 28 crore in connection with the cases. The high court has upheld the penalty, as well.
