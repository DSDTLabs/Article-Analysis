AHMEDABAD: Education minister   has once again assured the parent’s bodies that the government will not allow any school management to charge more fees than those fixed by the state government or the fee regulatory committee.

  The minister held a series of meetings with the parent’s bodies and the management. The parents informed the minister that the schools were pressurizing the parents to pay the old fees which they were charging just before the act was passed in the state assembly. However, despite opposition, the managements were not willing to reduce the fees.
 
 “A group of management officials, led by the  , also meet me and they have assured that they would soon be issuing letters to the parents that they would refund the excess fee,” said Chudasama.
 
 The minister said that the government was dedicated and determined not to allow any school to charge fees other than the fee fixed by the government in the assembly or the one which is fixed by the fee regulatory committee.
 
 Meanwhile, the parent’s body —   — have decided that they would be going to various schools and ask the parents to stop payment of cheques that they have given. “We will begin the campaign from   on Tuesday and we will persuade parents to stop payment. We want the management to charge only the fee decided by the government under the act and collect excess fee later once the fee regulatory committee fixes the fees,” said an office bearer.
