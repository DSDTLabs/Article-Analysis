HYDERABAD: The TRS government has decided to empower local bodies on the lines of Mahatma Gandhi's Swaraj (self-governance) model and is coming up with a new legislation for gram panchayats in the state. 

 The cabinet sub-committee which met here on Tuesday decided to give more powers to sarpanch and increase the funds to the panchayats. The new legislation on which the committee is deliberating will give top priority to accountability. Advocate general   also attended the meeting to give legal inputs to the committee.
 
 "The CM wanted us to complete the exercise by this weekend. The new legislation will revolutionise the local body administration," said T Nageswara Rao, minister for roads and buildings. The new legislation will make it mandatory to hold gram sabha in a regular and stipulated time. Safe drinking water, quality electricity supply, sanitation, street lights will be given top priority and funds will be disbursed directly to the village councils. The co-option membership in the village council will be offered to other local bodies including cooperative societies, self-help groups to make the village council truly representative.
 
 The committee has discussed the issue of giving power to sanction building plan up-to two floors to the district level officers. At present, all building plans should get the approval from the town planning department in Hyderabad. A final decision as to on whom the powers will be vested has been left to the CM who will meet the committee on Thursday.
 
 The committee also discussed on continuing the same reservation system for the next two elections. As the ward reservation is being changed for every election, it has become a big discouragement to the council members to focus on their divisions. Villages will be categorised to release funds and as per the preliminary discussions, it was decided to give 5 lakh, 10 lakh and 15 lakh to villages depending on their needs.
