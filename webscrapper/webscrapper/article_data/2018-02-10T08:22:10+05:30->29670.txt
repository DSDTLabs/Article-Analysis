CHANDIGARH:   in the city have become a headache for the residents as the streetlights too get covered by them. This results in little visibility especially at night.

 During a visit to the various sectors, it was found that the overgrown trees were not pruned since long, due to which, the streetlights installed in the areas serve no purpose of lighting during night. Residents of the sectors 11, 32 and 44 complained that they have raised the issue with the authorities a number of times but to no avail. No action has been taken till date, they claimed.
 
 J R Garg, a resident of Sector 32, said for the senior citizens, going out during the night becomes a nightmare. He said the residents are facing problems because of the   of the MC   towards the pruning of the trees. He that it should be including in the routine works of the concerned department, to get the prune trees trimmed as and when required, so that residents do not have to approach them for such a petty issue.
