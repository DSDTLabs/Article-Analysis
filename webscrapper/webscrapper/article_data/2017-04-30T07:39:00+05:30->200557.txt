Ferozepur: Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev Memorial Society, which organizes a week-long programme every year dedicated to the martyrs, has demanded that the historical pistol of Bhagat Singh with which he shot dead British police officer J P Saunders in 1928 should be brought back for display at Hussainiwala in Ferozepur. The three martyrs were cremated in Hussainiwala after their hanging on March 23, 1931, in Lahore.

 The pistol of Bhagat Singh was retrieved from the Central School of Weapons and Tactics (CSWT) of the BSF in Indore (Madhya Pradesh) after a gap of 47 years and six months. It was transferred to the BSF headquarters in Jalandhar following the intervention of the Punjab and Haryana high court on a PIL filed by activist advocate H C Arora, which said that the weapon deserved to be displayed at the martyrâ€™s memorial.
 
 The pistol, a .32 bore Colt of US make, was last seen in Punjab at the Punjab Police Academy, Phillaur, in October 1969, where it was lying since 1944 after it was received from the Lahore SSP. Later, it was requisitioned by the CSWT from Punjab Police Academy as it needed old weapons for explaining their development to BSF recruits. 
 
 Jaswinder Singh Sandhu, president of Shaheed Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev Memorial Society, said Hussainiwala memorial set up at the place where the martyrs were cremated was an ideal place to display the historical pistol. He said it could be exhibited at the BSF museum at the Hussainiwala joint checkpost, where the retreat ceremony is performed everyday in the presence of a large number of visitors. Sandhu said keeping the historical pistol of Bhagat Singh would add more significance to the historical place of Hussainiwala.
