THANE: The state's first toll post at   along the   is slated to shut operations on May 13. This is according to the central government's gazette notification issued in 2002, declaring the closure date. The toll post was set up in 1998. 

 Known as Kharegaon toll post, the National Highway Authority of India had authorized a private contractor, Ideal Road Builders (IRB), to collect toll from motorists heading out of Thane towards Nashik and another connecting road heading towards Mumbra.
 
 The contractor had developed the once-narrow stretch into a four-lane highway and it is estimated that work of widening the road and maintenance has cost the contractor Rs 180. 83 crore. The firm has declared that it has collected Rs 500 crore from this toll post.
 
 Citizen activist   said that the IRB's disclosure at the toll post that it has collected around Rs 500 crore since the post was set up may not be true. "The figures are obviously way too low. The toll post at Padgha, where traffic movement is 20% of what is seen on this road, has reported a toll collection of Rs792.62 crore in seven years since 2010. In this case, the IRB has been collecting toll from motorists for the past 15 years. We suspect that the actual collection is over Rs2,000 crore," said Ghanekar.
 
  are happy that not only will they travel for free, but also face less congestion which was caused due to the collection booth.
 
 "Citizens will organize a treat for the toll workers. We are going to give them a coconut, considered a good omen, and roses to express our happiness that finally they won't extort our money," said Ghanekar.
