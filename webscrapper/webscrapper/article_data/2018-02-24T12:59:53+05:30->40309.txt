There was a lot of confusion about the number of films releasing on Poila Boisakh this year. Till date, Dev-Rukmini starrer ‘Kabir’ has confirmed its release, while  's Prosenjit-Rituparna starrer ‘Drishtikone’, will reportedly be pushed back to 27th April along with ' ' featuring Abir Chatterjee.

 Now industry sources suggest Anjan Dutt’s musical drama ‘Aami Ashbo Phirey’ will be out on the big screens on 13th April, just two days ahead of the Bengali New Year. So, we can look for a massive box office clash once again just like in 2014. There are some unconfirmed reports that claim producer Kaustav Roy is also keen to release ‘Shankar Mudi’ on the same date.
 
 In 2014, the Bengali box-office witnessed a clash of titans - ‘Byomkesh Phire Elo’ and ‘Badshahi Angti’, which released on the same day. While one film had Abir Chatterjee as Byomkesh, the other had the actor playing Feluda. Both films were produced by the same person,   who added a twist to the box office clash to gain a wider audience.
