This invite-only art show opening was a rather tranquil affair, owing both to the theme of the show and the fact that there were only a handful of art aficionados in attendance. The guests took their time with each canvas as they strolled down the corridor of the five-star property where the show featuring works of a group of artists is on display. With a theme as profound as ‘a journey within’, the art sure rendered itself for some deep conversations and thoughts.
