Panaji: Accusing the BJP central leadership of indulging in   of MLAs to form the government in the state, Goa Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Girish Chodankar said the saffron party is trying to suppress the issue by filing police complaints. 

 Chodankar had earlier alleged that ‘more than Rs 1,000 cr ore has changed hands in a bid to win over alliance partners,’ following which, the Goa BJP had filed a defamation case against the All India Congress Committee and Chodankar. 
 
 “The BJP has filed a defamation case against me and also imposed Section 501 of the IPC, thereby curbing the media to write about the controversy. I am ready to apologize to the BJP only on the condition that they disclose the actual amount that was used to buy support or if they can prove me wrong,” Chodankar said, adding that the reduction in the BJP’s seat tally reveals that the public are no more in their favour. 
 
 Chodankar also claimed that governor Mridula Sinha took the decision of inviting the BJP to form the government ‘under pressure’.
 
 “When the Congress leadership met the governor to stake claim of the government, the governor did not make an eye contact with us and it was evident from her body language that she was under pressure. I empathize with her. I feel she may quit from her position very soon as she was forced to act against her wishes,” Chodankar said, stating that Sinha had communicated with Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and other senior BJP leaders before inviting BJP to form the government.
