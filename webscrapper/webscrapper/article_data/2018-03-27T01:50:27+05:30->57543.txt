A news article, headlined ‘Khaleda son slams Indian foreign policy’, was published in The Times of India’s Kolkata edition on March 6. Certain comments and statements were attributed to Bangladesh Nationalist Party senior vice-chairman Tarique Rahman; those comments and statements were obtained from a Facebook page, which bore Rahman’s name and introduced him as the BNP’s senior vice-chairman.

 However, in a letter dated March 9, we were informed by AKM Quamruzzaman, solicitor representing Rahman, that the BNP senior vice-chairman had no Facebook page and the comments and statements attributed to him were wrong. We apologise for the inadvertent error.
