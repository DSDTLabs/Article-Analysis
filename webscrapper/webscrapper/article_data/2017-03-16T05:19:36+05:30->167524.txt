NEW DELHI: What started as stray voices alleging tampering of EVMs to benefit the   turned into a chorus as Delhi CM Arvind   blamed AAP’s defeat in Punjab on the machines and   chief   threatened to move court against her party’s disastrous performance in UP.

 The protests received a leg-up when   said a probe should be ordered to clear doubts over the poll process.
 
 Kejriwal said 20-25% of AAP’s votes in Punjab were transferred to SAD-BJP to keep   out of power. 
 
 He has already demanded that EVMs be replaced by ballot papers in the upcoming MCD polls, though the state election authority turned it down.
 
 In Lucknow, Mayawati said, “After we did not get a proper reply from the   on our complaint lodged soon after the results were announced on March 11, the party has decided to go to court so as to save (the country) from such a fraud.” 
 
 The trigger for doubts over EVMs was the results to the polls in five states on Saturday with AAP, said to be the dark horse in its maiden foray into Punjab, coming a cropper and BSP winning just 19 of 403 seats in UP, with BJP sweeping UP and Uttarakhand.
 
 Congress spokesperson Sushmita Dev said, “EVMs were brought in because there used to be complaints of booth capturing. 
 
 So, we will say that if any party has questions or doubts about EVMs, it is the duty of the   that they are investigated. 
 
 It is CEC’s duty to ensure voters have confidence in the electoral process.” She, however, couched her demand against EVMs as Congress offering its Punjab win to a probe to settle allegations made by AAP.
 
 The coming together of AAP and BSP along with the tacit backing of Congress, marks the emergence of a considerable voice against EVMs which were once heralded as a major breakthrough against the menace of booth capturing which marred polls in the country. BJP flayed the allegations by asking opponents to “gracefully accept the people’s mandate”.
