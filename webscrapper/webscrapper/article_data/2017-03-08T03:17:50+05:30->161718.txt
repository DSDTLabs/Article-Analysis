THANE: A 26-year-old man has been arrested on Tuesday for assaulting two on-duty constables at Yeoor on Monday. Three other accused are still on the run.

 The accused—Pratik Gurav (26) and his three friends Paresh Daga, Ramji Dayat and Pratik Prakash—were at a wedding ceremony in Patonpada village of Yeoor. As the music was too loud, constable Sahebrao Dabhade asked them to turn down the volume since the area falls under the forest zone.
 
 “Playing loud music is not allowed in the forest area. So, constable Dabhade was only doing his duty by asking them to turn down the volume. However, instead of abiding by the rules, the accused pulled the constable by his shirt and assaulted him. They also broke a bottle on another constable Chavan who was accompanying Dabhade,” said S S Ambre, investigating officer at Vartak Nagar police station. Gurav has been arrested and a search in on for the others.
