Mumbai: Five days after the   launched a satirical rejoinder to the Shiv Sena’s poll campaign, both parties are balking at the other’s “inefficiency” during its term in office. Sena has put up   under the tagline ‘Did you know’ taking credit for BMC’s achievements like installing 480 virtual classrooms with two-way videoconferencing. The billboards also tout Bal Thackeray Middle Vaitarna dam as the ninth fastest dam to be constructed in the world.

 Congress then initiated a parody on its Twitter handle mocking Sena’s statistics with a campaign called #DidYouKnow. City Congress president Sanjay Nirupam said, “We exposed the inefficiency and corruption in BMC. Where Sena says 480 classrooms are tech savvy, we have shown how 37 Marathi civic schools have closed.” Congress has adapted Sena’s saffron colour and its font to prepare the ads. Sena spokesperson Manisha Kayande said, “Let them mock us or copy us...it doesn’t bother us. When they were in power in the Centre and state, we saw one scam after another.” —Bella Jaisinghani
