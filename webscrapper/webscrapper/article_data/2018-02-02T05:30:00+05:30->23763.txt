Mysuru: Nearly a month after city police made ISI helmets mandatory, cops on Thursday educated those who were not donning certified helmets. 

 The cops on Thursday refrained from collecting the  , and initiated a friendly awareness drive from 9am to 7pm to ensure safety of motorists. The awareness drive was held throughout the day at all the major thoroughfares and junctions across the city.
 
 While a slip mentioning the nature of the offence was mentioned, no fine was collected from the violators. However, they also gave the motorists a warning, telling them that they stood to lose their vehicles the next time they were caught.
 
 Besides those not wearing helmets, bikers who were riding triples, car drivers not wearing their seat belts, and those who did not possess required documents such as driving licence, RC, etc. Motorists were given   for all such violations.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Vikram Amathe told TOI, “This was an awareness drive undertaken by the department. As a friendly initiative, traffic cops advised motorists to carry the necessary documents, wear ISI-certified helmets among others. Such drives will be carried out again to bring about discipline among tourists.”
 
 Motorists were mildly surprised to find cops at these major junctions, but were relieved not to be penalised.
