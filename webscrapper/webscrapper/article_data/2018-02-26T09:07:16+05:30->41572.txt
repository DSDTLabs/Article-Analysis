SILCHAR: A student of Class IX in   of   in   has successfully prevented efforts by her family to get her married off. The 15-year-old girl, who is going to appear in her matriculation examination next year, was determined to continue with her studies instead of getting married, and took a classmate's advice and recently lodged a complaint against her parents with the district legal service authorities. 

 On Sunday, the Cachar district legal cell, along with Child Development and Child Welfare, One Stop Centre and Child Line, went to the minor's house and talked to her parents.
 
 Biswajit Nath, a senior official from the Cachar district legal cell, told TOI, "The girl's parents were apprised of the ills of early marriage and its legal implications. We also recorded the girl's statement. The parents came around and have told us they have abandoned the decision to marry her off before she attains legal age." 
 
 The decision had been taken to arrange the girl's marriage with a boy from Tripura because of the financial situation of the family, Nath said. 
 
 Nath said the girl, who is a good student, had tried persuading her parents to let her continue going to school and then sought help from her classmates. She is now poring over her books with a beaming smile in preparation for her matriculation exams.
