LUCKNOW: UP deputy chief minister   on Friday announced that the all-boys government secondary schools would be turned into co-educational institutions. During a brainstorming session of education officials of UP and Haryana, Sharma said if any girl student wishes to study in these government secondary schools, she will be given admission. This is, in addition to the existing all-girls government schools. 

 There are 562 government inter colleges in UP. Of this, 200 are only for boys. While all secondary schools, from class IX-XII are co-educational, 200 inter colleges, which are from class VI to XII admit only boys. With the change, no government secondary school in UP will remain all-boys. Overall, there are 2,000 government secondary schools in UP.
 
 Welcoming the move, RP Mishra, state secretary, UP   said, "This will ensure girls get education. Most girls dropout at secondary level due to proximity of schools from their houses. One canâ€™t expect girls to travel 20 km to study in all-girls school. So, if an all-boys school is near by, they will now be able to enrol themselves there."
