When music composer   was looking for a voice to sing a crucial song in the upcoming film Iruvudellava Bittu, he could only think of Tamil star Simbu. While the actor has earlier rendered his voice for a couple of songs in Tamil and Telugu, Sridhar was keen on roping him in for a   film. “Simbu is well versed in music and has been known for the peppy dance numbers he has sung,” says the music director. Getting across to   for this song was initially a bit of a challenge. But what ensued after the meeting turned out to be a pleasant surprise for Sridhar. 

 “We approached Simbu through a co-ordinator and sent him a scratch of the song. He loved what he heard and we found out that he not only has a great interest in working in the Kannada film industry but also loves Bengaluru and the people here. He was extremely busy at the time, as he was shooting through the night for his Mani Ratnam film. He reached his home studio at 6.30 am, rehearsed the song and then sang it. He was extremely particular about the pronunciation. He believes that a language to be respected, and for that, it is important to get the right pronunciation. He stressed on every single word to ensure he got it right and even told me that in case we found any word to be off track, he would be willing to record for it again,” explains Sridhar. The film, directed by Kantha Kannalli, stars Meghana Raj and Tilak Shekar in the lead roles.
