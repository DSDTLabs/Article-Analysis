LUCKNOW: A six-and-a-half-inch   was operated out of the stomach of a ten-year-old   from Barabanki by a team of doctors at   (KGMU)  . The boy, Rishu, fell off a tree and on a stick that got lodged inside his abdomen. 

 “The patient was, however, not aware of the stick being inside his stomach since only an external wound was visible. After a few days of pain in the stomach, frequent bleeding from the wound and fever, the child was brought to us,” said Prof J D Rawat who headed the team of Dr Sudhir Singh, Dr Abhishek Singh, sister Vandana and anesthetist Dr Anita Malik and Dr Sarita Singh. 
 
 Initial clinical observation and X-ray bore no result and the stick was not visible in the tests. “It was after ten days of monitoring when the child was admitted that its presence was affirmed and the operation was done,” added Prof Rawat. The operation had been undertaken two months ago with a successful post operative follow-up completed on Monday.
