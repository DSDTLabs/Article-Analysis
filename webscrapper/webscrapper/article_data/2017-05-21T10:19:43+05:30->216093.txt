PUNE: The Orchid Towers   in the   has been dealing with daily waste through   and bio composting successfully for more than four years now. 

 The society's working body has played a vital role in this achievement. The members are not only active in garbage management but also spread awareness among families and their children residing in the society about the scientific ways of handling garbage.
 
 Swapna Narayan, the secretary of the society, said, "We have been working on garbage management and processing from 2013 - before the civic administration's guideline came in 2014. The society as of now has constructed 10 pits to process waste, of which three have vermicompost facility. The society has a total of 108 flats. About 60-65kg of waste is generated every day. The manure is utilized by the society members for gardening."
 
 The society earlier had seven pits for bio composting. Three vermicomposting pits were added after the members found that more facilities were required to handle the waste.
 
 "Only constructing pits was not enough. We felt a need for awareness. We sent emails to the society members. Efforts were taken to reach every house to ensure everyone's participation in waste management. The members were explained how to segregate dry and wet waste. We also decided to collect the medical waste like pampers in  . The waste like glass and plastics is collected separately as well. All, including children, have been told how to deal with garbage," Narayan said.
 
 She added that the society had decided to keep separate bags to collect leaves of trees which go to compost. The housekeeping staffers, who play a vital role in handling garbage, had been explained how compost pits work and how to put garbage in it, she said.
 
 The society bagged third place in the Pune Municipal Corporation's first ever Swachh awards conducted in 2016 for efforts taken up for solid waste management.
