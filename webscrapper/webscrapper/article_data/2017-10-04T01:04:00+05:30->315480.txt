Madurai: The price of shallots or small onions which has touched Rs 100 a kilogram is likely to remain high for the next three months in view of the festival and pilgrimage season. However, the saving grace for consumers has come in the form of tiny Bellary onions costing just Rs 12 a kg which have been flooding the markets.

 Dindigul district is known for its onion cultivation, predominantly shallots which are cultivated on about 3,000 to 4,000 hectares. However, drought conditions had brought down the cultivation by more than fifty per cent. Deputy director of horticulture, Dindigul, Suresh Sriram said that it would take at least another three months for the price of shallots to come down as only some farmers had taken up cultivation and it would take another two months for them to harvest their crops.
 
 Unlike millets, all vegetable crops, including onions are water-intensive and though there was rainfall this season it was insufficient to recharge the ground water for a full-fledged cultivation to take place, he said. Onion was a short-term crop of which harvesting can be done 65 days after cultivation. As some of the farmers have just sown the seeds it will take another two months to harvest, he added. 
 
 A P Mahendran, a farmer and wholesale onion seller, said that the price of onion seeds had also increased many fold making it difficult for farmers. ``Onion seeds per hectare cost Rs 50,000 and there is an additional cost of Rs 50,000 for cultivation. So, Rs 1 lakh is needed to cultivate onions on an acre,’’ he said. When water availability was also less, farmers were not ready to take the risk, he added.
 
 On the other hand, onion bulbs are selling at Rs 1,500 a kilogram. Since they start sprouting in 40 days and can be harvested in three months, many farmers had gone for it, he said. The price of mature big onions has been hovering over Rs 25 to Rs 30 at present.
