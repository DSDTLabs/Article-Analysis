Bhopal: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had a bit of advice for IPS and   officers on Civil Services Day — don’t turn it into an India-Pakistan sort of rivalry.

 “Ego issues of IAS and IPS officer hurt. There should not be an India-Pakistan-like situation between them. It is not about one service, but of service to public,” the CM said at an event at RCVP Noronha Academy in Bhopal on Friday.
 
 Officials feel the CM was hinting at differences between the IAS and IPS lobby on introduction of police commissionerate system in Bhopal and Indore — a proposal that has again been pushed to the backburner. Chouhan has spoken on easing IAS-IPS rivalry in the past, too.
 
 The CM lauded officers of MP and pointed out that even a single officer can change the face of a department. “Civil servants have the responsibility of making lives of people better. Civil service is not a job, it is a mission. A civil servant should be positive and sensitive,” he said, adding: “It is very important to render our services with patience, perseverance and enthusiasm. Officers of all three wings of civil services need to work in cooperation and harmony to achieve success.”
 
 He said work in every sphere is better in MP because os officers of IAS, IPS and IFS. “I strongly feel that involving public representatives in implementation of schemes is important. In our state, we try our best to include public participation in every campaign,” he said, adding that if any campaign turns into a mass movement, it is likely to prove a great success. 
 
 Senior bureaucrats later told TOI that there may be a difference of opinion on some issues, but nothing beyond that. Former DGP S C Tripathi said: “Everyone, be it an IAS or IPS officer, has the right to express their views. There is no winner or loser. If something goes wrong in a district, the image of both collector and SP suffers.”
