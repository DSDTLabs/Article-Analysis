Vadodara: Blind person don’t need to see the paintings in this exhibition to appreciate the work!

 Bhausingh Bambhaniya is one of those rare artists who uses the Braille language to ensure that his artworks are admired by the blind persons. The 30-year-old’s every painting carries a description of his work in Braille language. 
 
 “I describe my paintings in the Braille language so that the blind can understand what my work is about. The artist community always uses visual medium to exhibit its artworks and I always used to think as a student as to how can art admirers, who can’t see, admire such works. So I thought of working for the cause of such people,” Bhausingh, who is M S University’s fine arts faculty alumnus, told TOI. He learnt the Braille language especially for the cause and even made his paintings on the theme of blind persons.
 
 “I used to ask blind persons as to how they visualize a particular object or animal after telling them some stories like that a monkey who smartly hoodwinked a crocodile that tried to eat him. Based on their description I began making paintings,” he added. Bhausingh has also begun a drive to encourage people for making eye donations. 
 
 “As an experiment, I keep closed boxes with a small opening and ask people to put their hand in it and touch the object inside. Most people are scared to put their hand as they can’t see what is inside the box. And this is how blind people feel all the time. This is the best way to encourage people to donate their eyes,” he said. He also donates some his earnings for the cause of the blind but never sells the paintings that have description in Braille language. “Those paintings are for people, especially the blind, so I don’t want them hanging in some person’s drawing room,” he said.
