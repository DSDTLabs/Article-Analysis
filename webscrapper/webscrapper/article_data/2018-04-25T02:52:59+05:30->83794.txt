NEW DELHI: The   auction process of   may   again on   with New Delhi Municipal Council ( ) issuing   for this prestigious property. The new norms are likely to relax the eligibility criteria to bid as the earlier ones were panned by several hospitality sector players as being too restrictive. Under those norms, only a handful like Taj, Oberoi and ITC could have bid for the prime Mansingh Road hotel.

 “We are issuing tenders day after,” NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar told TOI late on Monday night. While NDMC was tightlipped on what the new norms would be, sources said a larger number of players could become eligible to bid for the hotel now.
 
 The e-auction for the property was originally supposed to take place on January 30. But the eligibility norm then meant only groups already running five-star hotels in India could have bid for Taj Mansingh. Such groups were to have at least 500 rooms in not more than five five-star properties and have a sizeable net worth and operational income from hotels. This left out financial investors and foreign hotel operators.
 
 “There is significant interest in this property among players other than the big three. Let us see how much relaxation NDMC does in the fresh tender document. Taj will obviously do all to retain this property,” said a leading Delhi hotelier.
 
 The iconic Mansingh Road property was given to Tata Group’s Taj Hotels on a lease for 33 years, which ended in 2011. In the now-scrapped tender, NDMC had kept a minimum reserve price of Rs 32.2 crore for Taj Mansingh. The earlier tender had called for a minimum revenue share arrangement of 17.2% of the gross revenue and a minimum guarantee fee of about Rs 3 crore per month, subject to escalation, to be paid by the successful bidder.
