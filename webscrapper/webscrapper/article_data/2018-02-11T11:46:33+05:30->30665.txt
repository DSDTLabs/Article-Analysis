KOCHI: India Post’s decision to close shut down the lone surviving post office on MG Road, the city’s busy commercial centre, has not gone down well with postal staff and oldtimers. The post office near Jos Junction, adjacent to the   South, has been functioning for more than 30 years, and the decision to shift the post office to MMS facility near Ernakulam Junction Railway Station has invited protests.

 National Federation of Postal Employees ( , Ernakulam) secretary Arun R Das said MG Road was one of the busiest commercial centres and that the department will end up not having a presence in the commercial hub. “Shifting it from MG Road will not be helpful in revenue generation,” he added.
 
 With MG Road regaining its commercial significance after the arrival of  , building owners have increased rentals. The India Post has so far been paying a meagre amount as rent, and the building owner’s demand to increase it resulted in law suits. Subsequently, the department took a decision to shift the post office.
 
 India Post has been closing down offices, which were not profitable. The NFPE has also been apprehensive that in the future the department of post would cut down staff strength. “Currently, there are about 15 staff attached with the general post office. The facilities at MMS is not sufficient enough for carrying out everyday operations,” he said adding that the employees’ federation has already taken out a protest in front of the head post office at Ernakulam. “We will continue with the protest,” he added. NFPE also said the department is also planning to close down the   post office.
 
 Officials with the department said the inconveniences caused to public due to shifting of the post office would be minimal. “The head post office, on the Hospital Road, is not far away. The post office on the MG Road does not offer any special service. All services are available at other places also,” said an official.
