MUMBAI: The   on Thursday directed the   to spell out the steps taken to make travel in   safer for children and suggested setting up a   number for parents to lodge complaints.

The court was hearing a   filed by the   which alleged that safety of children was being compromised as rules for issuing permits for school buses was not being strictly enforced.
 
 “Children must travel safely and their parents must not worry constantly about their well being,” the bench said. The judges remarked that in some parts of the state they had seen children travelling in overcrowded vans and even autorickshaws. The judges said, “How do you monitor overcrowded school buses? Are there special squads appointed to check this? Do all buses which have permits to operate as school buses comply with the specifications prescribed and confirm to the standards?”
 
  
  
 As per the 2016 amendment to the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, school bus permit can be issued only to a vehicle that has a seating capacity of 13 and above. However, the state rules define a school bus having a seating capacity up to 12 and autorickshaws with “a hard top and closed passenger body”. Government pleader Abhinandan Vagyani said the state was in the process of making changes to the state rules to allow permits to be issued to school vans.
 
 Vagyani said 11,922 vehicles with seating capacity of less than 12 are registered as school buses in the state, but only 8,591 have a contract with the management. The remaining could have been engaged privately by parents, he added.
