LUCKNOW: A forged Lucknow University notice announcing change in passing marks led to confusion on Wednesday. The notice (a copy of which is with TOI) was circulated on   among students of Isabella Thoburn College, declaring that passing marks have been changed from 17 to 22 out of 50 for the examination.

 The notice said that: “This is to acknowledge students the passing marks of examination 2017 will be 22 out of 50 which earlier 17 out of 50.” To verify the notice circulated on social media, students contacted officials on the   of the university where they found the notice missing.
 
 “The notice was circulated on WhatsApp and was also updated by some students on Facebook questioning its authenticity,” said   student Divya Mishra. She added that date mentioned on the notice was February 7 and made it appear dubious. If the notice was more than two-month-old the college would have intimated us about changes made by the university.
 
 Another student Ankita Dixit said the notice created confusion and to confirm the change she confirmed it with the university whether it was authentic.
 
 “Some students has played mischief by downloading an old science notice from the   official website and circulated it after making some changes. An enquiry has been ordered to find out who circulated the message,” said A K Mishra, controller of examinations at LU.
 
 He said no changes in passing marks can be made by the university unless approved by the academic and executive council. There was no meeting held to make the changes, as passing marks are still the same, he added. He said the information had been circulated under ‘board of examination’ head, something that doesn’t exist.
