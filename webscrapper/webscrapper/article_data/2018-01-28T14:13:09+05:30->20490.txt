INDORE: The driver's error and overspeeding led to the January 5 DPS bus accident that claimed five lives, including those of four children, concluded a magisterial probe on Saturday.

 The probe report, submitted by ADM Ruchika Chouhan to district collector Nishant Warwade, alleges that DPS failed to abide by safety norms set by the Supreme court and CBSE. This should be probed further for necessary action, the magistrate recommends.
 
 The probe found that the fitness certificate was issued by RTO without verifying whether the speed limiting device installed on the ill-fated bus worked. The speed governor company also failed to ascertain the capacity of the device it supplied, the report says.
 
 The bus was overspeeding, which led to error by driver Rahul Sisodia, causing the bus to jump a divider and collided head-on with a truck, it says. Chouhan also found that the PWD and   ( ) made "technical mistakes" in constructing the stretch of Indore bypass, leaving it vulnerable to accidents.
 
 The ADM gave various suggestions to enhance safety of children in schoolbuses, including reforms in transport system, monitoring the mechanism involving parents' bodies and enhanced vigilance before issuing fitness certificate to buses.
