LUCKNOW: Decks have been cleared for completion of the   railway overbridge project with the ministry of defence giving the no objection certificate (NOC) to the district administration on Thursday. 

 "The roadblock has finally been cleared. Both, UP public works department and UP bridge corporation have been asked to speed up construction work so that the ROB is ready by the end of 2018," said Lucknow district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma. 
 
 The Malhaur ROB is directly connected to outer ring road. It starts near   and ends near Virajkhand. The ROB would bring huge relief to locals and passengers from Barabanki, Faizabad, Gorakhpur route as the railway crossing had become a major traffic bottleneck with traffic jams lasting for hours. 
 
 The project was proposed in 2013 and construction continued till 2016 when work was stalled first because of permission from railways and then from Army. The incomplete flyover compounded the traffic problems. 
 
 A local student   filed a petition before the Lucknow Bench of Allahabad high court and in February 2017, Justice   directed Lucknow administration to obtain the required NOCs at the earliest. 
 
 Locals expressed happiness on coming to know that the ROB construction would resume soon.
