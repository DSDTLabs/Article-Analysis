We want to designate and earmark a place for bus bays, autos, two-wheelers, cars. There will be a hierarchy with feeder buses being closest to the staircases. Then there will be bicycles, autos, two-wheelers and eventually cars,“ said  , managing director,   ( ). This distance, some fourwheeler owners feel, might act as a deterrent for car owners to take to the metro rail. “If I have to travel three-four kms by car to reach the metro station, spend 5 minutes to park the vehicle and then walk for about a kilometre to board the metro to travel for another four-six kms, I might as well cover the entire stretch by car. It would save time and energy ,“ said Satish B, a techie living in Manikonda.
