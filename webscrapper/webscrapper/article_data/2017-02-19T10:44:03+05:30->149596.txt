MUMBAI: The number of IIT-Bombay students going to foreign universities on   has increased by over 20 times in the last 12 years. In 2005, only two students went to the   for a semester to explore the country. The number has now gone up to 42 now. 

 A majority of the 205 students who have participated in such exchange programmes since 2004 are from the electrical engineering department (52). Singapore’s National University of Singapore (NUS) and   (NTU) are the most sought-after among IIT-B students, accounting for one third of the outbound exchanges.
 
 From the dual degree programme, 126 students – the highest— have gone so far, followed by 52 from B Tech, 21 from M Tech and six from Ph D. The analysis of the outbound students in exchange programmes was done by a group of students for the campus magazine Insight with help from the institute’s International Relations Office. 
 
 The students have cited the increasing number of collaborations with foreign universities and more awareness about exchange programmes, as the primary reasons for the growth in the numbers. The institute has collaborated with other universities in more countries over the years including Denmark, France, Spain, Canada, Switzerland and Germany. Around 90% of the students going abroad are from undergraduate programmes.
 
 Shubham Goyal, the institute secretary of international relations, said more number of students from the electrical engineering department go for the exchange programmes than any other departments as more students are enrolled there. “While the strength of the electrical department is around 150 students in one batch, departments like energy have only about 30,” he said.
