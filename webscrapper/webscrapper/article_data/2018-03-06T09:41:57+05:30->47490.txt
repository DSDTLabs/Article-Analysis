 Speaking in Jeetpur, CM Yogi called SP-BSP alliance as one of snake and mole. “When a storm comes, snake and mole come together. Today the condition is same. This alliance will promote corruption, anarchy, riots, lawlessness, and goondaraj.” Recalling the bitter animosity between SP and BSP earlier, Yogi said, “SP used to say that it will destroy the monuments and statutes constructed by BSP while BSP threatened to destroy Safai on coming to power. The same parties have now come together.”
 
 “We are sure of BJP’s victory and this alliance will prove futile. If BJP wins, development will win. If BJP wins, people will be safe and secure. It will be the victory of villages, poor and farmers,” said Yogi.
