MUMBAI: Topping up on the $2.55b (Rs 16,347.5 crore) investment made in Indian cricket to bag exclusive global rights for the Indian Premier League ( ) for the next five years only six months ago, Disney’s newly-acquired India arm,   Pvt Ltd, cut another cheque of $944m (Rs 6138 crore) on Thursday to bag the consolidated bilateral rights for Indian cricket during the same period.

 
 In doing so, Star India has now committed a massive $3.36b (Rs 22,485.5 crore) to Indian cricket between now and FY 2022-23. In what turned out to be a fierce online bidding process with its closest rival Sony Pictures Network (SPN), Star eventually bid Rs 19.41 crore more to take home the   rights. The former Rupert Murdoch’s Foxled India arm – which has now been taken over by Walt Disney following a $54b deal in late 2017 – will pay BCCI a little in excess of Rs 60 crore (Rs 60.176 crore to be precise) per match. SPN and Reliance Jio Infocomm were the other bidders in the fray.
 
 From a world cricket standpoint, the England Cricket Board’s (ECB) five-year deal – the second costliest after this one – stands at $287m. In the first year of the deal, Star will pay BCCI Rs 1083.16 crore, Rs 1564.57 crore in year two, Rs 842.46 in year three and Rs 1323.87 in years four and five.
 
 BCCI CEO  , the man at the helm as Indian cricket goes about raking in moolah like never before, sounded ecstatic. “Indian cricket sets the trend for global cricket and today’s result shows are a testimony to the global leadership of BCCI,” he said.
 
 Johri has lead BCCI through the last four big-ticket deals: title rights, jersey rights, IPL and now the bilateral series rights. The break-up of the year-wise payment is based on the allocation of 102 bilateral matches falling under the newly drafted Future Tour Program (FTP) of the International Cricket Council (ICC), which is inclusive of all formats. The 102 matches are divided as follows: 18 matches in year one, 26 in year two, 14 in year three and 22 each in year four and five.
 
 Star listed the per match value for each of the five years of the deal as follows: Rs 46 crore (per match in year one), 47 crore (year two), 46.5 crore (year three), 77.4 crore (year four) and 78.9 crore (year five) respectively. To give an idea of what this investment may mean from a global perspective, Major League Baseball (MLB) – one of the world’s biggest sports properties – pays close to 52 crore per game. “BCCI rights come expensive, but then good things have a price. Star and BCCI can transform the sporting experience,” Star India chairman Uday Shankar said.
