HYDERABAD: Counter Intelligence police of   were reportedly detained by Uttar Pradesh police at   while they were scouring the area for   operatives. 

 Telangana police played a key role in busting the ISIS module in UP recently and when a team of CI cell cops were moving at Etawah to zero in on terror suspects, a day before the encounter of alleged ISIS operative Saifullah in  , locals grew suspicious and alerted police. As CI cell cops were not well versed in Hindi and not carrying ID cards, police detained them for questioning. CI cell members were let off the next day after intervention of a senior intelligence official from Telangana. For operational secrecy, CI cell cops often don't carry ID cards with them.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Telangana DGP Anurag Sharma said, "Some of our men were stopped by   and once identity was established, they were let off. There was no detention."
