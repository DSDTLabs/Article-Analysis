PTIALA: Special prosecutor of the Enforcement Directorate (ED) Jagjitpal Singh Sarao on Friday started the examination of the witnesses who are to depose before the court in Patiala in connection with the   case in the synthetic drug haul of Punjab.

 In July last year, the special   court, which is also designated to hear the cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002, had framed charges against key accused   and others under Section 4 of the PMLA for using the proceeds of crime to buy properties. ED had pressed charges under sections 3 and 4 of the PML Act, but the court had allowed framing of Bhola under Section 4.
 
 Sarao said they had lined up a number of witnesses before the court to substantiate the charges against Bhola and his accomplices. A total of 45 accused, along with two firms, are under EDâ€™s scanner for their alleged links with Bhola and were believed to be involved in laundering money generated thorough sale of synthetic drugs. ED had been conducting inquiries to ascertain the use and flow of money, which Bhola and his associates had allegedly generated from their drug business.
