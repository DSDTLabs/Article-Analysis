CHANDIGARH: If you are visiting any friend in Sector 51, you must know that your phone might face network issues. Wondering why? The cell phones of the residents of Sector 51, who live near the model  , fail to connect to the network often because mobile jammers are installed in the jail. These jammers block the network signals and therefore, the residents face poor cell phone reception in this area.

 So, many times, the residents can be seen roaming around their houses or standing in the balconies in search of signal. 
 
 During a visit to the area, the residents said they have been facing network issue for more than six years now. It’s especially between 10am to 11am and 4pm to 5.30pm, when the mobile signal is not available in their area. Residents said they are used to weak cell phone signal now. So, whenever they call, they first check the clock and then try to dial the number. “It’s really a problem because whenever a relative or a friend visits us, he/she has to bear the same problem,” said one of the residents. 
 
 The residents said that it’s not only the residents of the societies, who are facing network problem. People residing in Sector 50 also struggle to get proper cell phone signal.
 
 Sangeeta Lekhi, a resident of New Light, Sector 51, which is located near the jail, said her family took a wrong decision to stay near the jail. “I am facing network issue since day one. The society residents have tried subscribing to all network providers, but the problem remains unsolved,” she said.
 
 S S  , president of Citizen Welfare Society, Sector 51, said that the residents are aware of the fact that the security of the jail is an important issue but the authorities should come up with some provision so that the residents stop facing such problems. 
 
 He said the association has also taken up the issue with the authorities but till date, no solution has been found.
