MEERUT: Pankhuri Pathak, Samajwadi Party spokesperson and a known face on prime time TV news shows, landed in trouble over her   post about “namaz on road” forcing a delay of 30 minutes while she was on her way to appear in an exam recently.

 The post, which was shared close to 1,800 times on Facebook, kicked a social media storm when her own party supporters attacked her with claims that she was going to join   soon.
  
 Pathak later clarified that she is a “Samajwadi” at heart and will be with Akhilesh Yadav till the end of her life. She also shared her old pictures with former CM and his wife Dimple Yadav on Facebook and Twitter. 
  
 “I was just trying to bring out a problem. There is little room for positive debate in the country. The controversy taught me that intolerant people exist on both sides of the debate,” Pankhuri told TOI.
  
 Many Samajwadi Party symaphisers shared their critical comments on the post with some hinting that the SP spokesperson would soon be jumping the ship to join BJP while others attacked her for being narrow mined in attacking Muslims during  . 
  
 “I have earlier written about and the raised issue of inconvenience during Shravan month and Kanwar Yatra. The problem is that in the present polarised political ecosystem, every remark is seen through communal lens,” Pankhuri said.
  
 Recently, tension had gripped Haryana’s Gurgaon after some right-wing outfits allegedly disrupted namaz at 10 locations in the city. Protesters gathered under the aegis of ‘Hindu Sanyukt Sangarsh Samiti’ and claimed that Muslim worshippers did not have permission to offer prayers at roadsides, parks, and vacant government lands in the city.
