Margao: Town and country planning minister   Sardesai on Thursday said that the government was willing to incentivize expansion of industries in all industrial estates of the state provided they ensure that local youths are given employment. 

 “The government is willing to allow an increase in floor area ratio (FAR) for all the industries so as to facilitate their expansion. But they need to guarantee that they will employ local youths. Otherwise, why do we need these industries here? If Goan youth do not get jobs in Goan industries, people will start questioning why we are allowing such industries in Goa,” Sardesai told reporters on the sidelines of an inauguration of a showroom in Margao.
 
 Sardesai condemned the attitude of Cipla for advertising in other states for vacancies in their Goa factory, and demanded an apology from the management. 
 
 Referring to a fresh advertisement inviting applications, preferably from Goans, for skill development training programme, Sardesai felt “it could just be an eyewash” owing to the stand taken by the Goa Forward Party. 
 
 He called on the people of Goa to closely monitor the resources and assets of all industries who have set shop in Goa so that “Goans do not get a raw deal”. 
 
 If Goan youth do not get jobs in Goan industries, people will start questioning why we are allowing such industries in Goa
