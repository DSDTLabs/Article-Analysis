 Shiv Sena on Tuesday clarified that sitting chairman Shivaji Sahane would hold the post till a new chairperson was democratically appointed by the union.
 
 "There is no difference of opinion in Shiv Sena. The chairman will be elected only through proper procedure," city chief of the party Ajay Boraste said. 
 
 Sahane, meanwhile said, "I want to quit the post as it was not possible for me to be there. I would have anyway resigned on May 26. From next month onwards I will have to start touring the district for the election next year."
 
 "My only contention is that I being the sitting chairman I should have been taken into confidence," he added.
