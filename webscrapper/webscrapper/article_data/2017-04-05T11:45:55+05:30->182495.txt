Raman and Ishita go to the counsellor for Ruhi and Adi. Counsellor's weird solutions makes Ishita angry.
 
  After going home, Ishita is packing household stuff for Adi. Ruhi comes and complains that she doesn't want her manager to shift to Hisar with Adi.
  
  Raman tells her that Mr. Gupta is an experienced person and will help Adi. Ruhi taunts Adi that he won't be able to do anything by himself.
  
  
 
  
  Ishita interferes and says Ruhi is right. She asks Raman to give Mr. Gupta leave for a month. She then tells Adi that he won't be allowed to take any professional help and has to prove himself. She also asks Ruhi to do all her household work herself as it will be fair for both of them. Ruhi also takes the challenge.
  
  Raman compliments Ishita and asks her to take some time off to spend it with him.
  
  Aaliya on the other hand is worried for Adi.
