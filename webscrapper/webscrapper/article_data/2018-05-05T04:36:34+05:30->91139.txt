AHMEDABAD: Just how much heat are traffic policemen exposed to while performing their duties? A recently published study by a team from universites in   and the US measured occupational heat stress that 16 traffic policemen in the city faced. The study found that the policemen were exposed to temperatures ranging from 31.6°C to 36.8°C at peak hours and between 34.6°C and 49.1°C at some places. 

 These measurements were made in the course of six weeks of June and July 2015. The researchers were from the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, University of California, Berkeley, University of Washington, Seattle and the  , San  .
 
 The researchers had measured personal ambient temperatures of the policemen using data loggers, wet-bulb-globe temperature instrument. The average age of the 16 policemen was 35 years.
 
 The study pointed out that the occupational heat stress exposure resulting from working at traffic junctions was likely to have implications on the health of the police personnel. Further, the researchers observed that the “exposure of workers who work near roadways is not well characterised by conventional temperature monitoring stations.” The study had emphasised that various strategies were recommended to protect traffic police from heat exposures.
