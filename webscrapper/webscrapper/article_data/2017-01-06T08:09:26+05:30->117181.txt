DHNABAD: At a time when the whole country is going   in its  , there has been a surge in the number of   recorded here. Several   are now in a fix and are regretting their decision to accept cheque payments 

 Sandeep Agarwal, proprietor of Agarwal Electrical Agencies in Jharna Para, Hirapur said he received a total of 12 cheques from different customers of various banks and all of them have bounced. When Agarwal tried to contact the customers, he found that either some of them had changed their phone numbers or were not available.
 
 "Business is getting tougher as people do not have cash and banks are not able to provide us point of sale (PoS) machines. For every cheque that gets bounced, there is a penalty of Rs 250 from the bank's side. We are in a situation where business seems to be impossible," Sandeep said.
 
 He added, "I am already fighting two cases of cheque bounce for the last 5 years and I may have to file 12 more cases and keep attending the dates of court." 
 
 Rohit Agarwal of JB Electrical in Govindpur and Tinku Agarwal of Hindustan Sales Agencies in Saraidhela find themselves on a similar boat. The duo now prefers losing business than accepting cheque payments.
 
 Senior advocate and district president of Congress Brajendra Pratap Singh said that cases regarding cheque bounce have surged and are only expected to rise in the future. 
 
 Dhanbad Chamber of Commerce president Rajesh Gupta said, "If the government wants to create a cashless society, it should frame the policies and laws accordingly. Small businessmen cannot keep going to the court as business gets affected."
