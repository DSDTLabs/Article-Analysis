MUMBAI: In damage control mode after the custodial death of convict   at   prison last year, the   authorities have begun a   for female prison guards on how to behave with  . Five batches of guards from across Maharashtra have completed the programme, which will continue for another few months. The jail authorities may extend the training to male guards.

 Jailor Manisha Pokharkar and five female guards had been arrested for thrashing, kicking and punching Shetye on June 23, 2017. A seven-hour riot broke out in the prison after Shetye’s death.
 
 “The prison environment is such that guards and inmates are under stress. Severe overcrowding in prison escalates problems. Everyone is running low on patience. In the backdrop of the Shetye case, it became necessary for female guards to be counselled about prisoners’ rights, besides their own rights and duties,” said a senior prison department official.
 
 On the second and fourth Friday of every month, 40 female guards are coached at the jail officers’ training college in Pune. Those who can’t make it to Pune due to work are trained through video-conferencing. “We want to ensure that guards from every single prison in the state are trained. The bigger prisons are represented by two guards at training sessions, while smaller ones send one guard each,” the officer said. The guards are briefed on high court and Supreme Court directions, laws such as sexual harassment at the workplace, human rights, government resolutions, constitutional and fundamental rights and how the Right to Information (RTI) Act works. Most importantly, guards are taught when to use force, how much of it, and having an overall humane approach towards prisoners.
 
 The jail authorities have engaged a prison superintendent to monitor and supervise the training. “Having worked on the ground, he will be familiar with challenges faced by staff and problems suffered by prisoners, way better than a rank outsider,” said a senior official.
 
 Jail authorities have also introduced a ‘video-calling’ facility for female inmates. Twice a month, female inmates can make a video call to their families. Another programme, where children of female inmates can spend few hours with them inside prison, has also been introduced.
