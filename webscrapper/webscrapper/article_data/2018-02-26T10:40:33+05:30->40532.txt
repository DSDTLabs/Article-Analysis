 Transport minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’   attributed fatal accidents to rash, negligent driving. He said it is not possible for the RTO authorities to monitor the entire road network in the state.
 
 “Minibuses are worst offenders. They drive recklessly to overtake and get more passengers. These competitions lead to accidents. Helmet-less two-wheeler riders also raise road fatalities despite knowledge about the benefits of helmet use,” Dhavalikar said.
