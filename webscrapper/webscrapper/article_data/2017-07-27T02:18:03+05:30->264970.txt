NEW DELHI: The president of JNU Student’s Union ( ),  , is no longer a student of the university as he has failed to pay the   imposed on him by July 26, the last day of submission.

 Pandey, a media studies PhD student, was not allowed to   himself for the monsoon semester. He said the fine levied on him was an attempt by the administration to “throw protesting students out of JNU.” He added that as he has not been allowed to register for the next session, his work of the past three and a half years has gone to waste.
 
 Several other students faced the prospect of losing out on their studentship status, but they were directed by Delhi high court on Wednesday to pay the fine in the next three days and wait for the results of the inquiry.
 
 The JNUSU president alleged that the administration is trying to crush dissent in the campus. “The recent remarks of “capturing JNU” and “fighting war on JNU” were in the same context as the VC is trying to disallow any kind of resistance,” Pandey said. He claimed that putting a fine on students, setting up inquiries against them and stopping their academic work is the “only method through which the VC can stop opposition.” Pandey said he will not pay to protest the “ransom tactics of the administration.”
 
 “Currently, I am facing six inquiries and two false FIRs. The inquiries range from pasting posters to raising a question over the appointment of the VC. In one case, I was punished even before the inquiry could start,” he added.
 
 The student said that no set procedures and standards of inquiries are followed by the administration. “It has become difficult for us to get free and fair judgment through an unbiased inquiry. The administration is not conversing with the students. A few days ago, I tried to meet the VC but he refused,” Pandey said.
 
 The administration had levied fine on over 20 students, particularly for the October 19 protest at the administration block for the “unlawful confinement” of the VC.
