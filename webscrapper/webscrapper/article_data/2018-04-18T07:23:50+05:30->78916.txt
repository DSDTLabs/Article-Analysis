LUCKNOW: In view of reports of inconvenience in the tendering process, the state government raised the ceiling for   to Rs 10 lakh on Tuesday. After this, local tenders could be issued for any government job worth less than Rs 10 lakh.

 This is the second revision since the scheme was launched by the   government in May 2017 with Rs 1-lakh ceiling to check corruption. The last time a revision took place was on March 27, 2018 when the ceiling was raised from Rs 1lakh to Rs 5 lakh.
 
 The decision was taken during a   held on Tuesday. Officials said that the change was made because after the implementation of Rs 1lakh ceiling rule last year, some departments had said that they were facing inconveniences in implementation.
 
 Interestingly, this was the same reason cited when the ceiling was raised less than a month earlier from 1 lakh to 5 lakh.
