Udhagamandalam: A male  , which was found abandoned in   forest division a month ago, was brought to Theppakadu elephant camp in   Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris for treatment on Monday.

 The 8-month-old calf was found abandoned in Ayyur Thenkani Kottai range of forests in Hosur division a month ago. “It was slightly injured and underwent treatment in Hosur,” field director of MTR Srinivas R Reddy told TOI. Attempts by forest department officials to reunite the calf with its mother went futile, he revealed.
 
 “A mahout from MTR was sent to Hosur division a few weeks ago so that the calf would get familiarised with him,” said Reddy.
 
 The decision to bring the calf to Theppakadu elephant camp was taken at the official capacity of the chief wildlife warden. After a few months, it would be decided at higher level whether the calf should be retained at Mudumalai camp or to be sent to Vandalur Zoo, said Reddy. According to Dr E Vijayaraghavasn, forest veterinarian attached to MTR, the calf is doing fine. tnn
