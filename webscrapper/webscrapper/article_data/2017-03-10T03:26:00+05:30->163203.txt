Panaji: The sixth offshore casino will soon enter river Mandovi as the state government on Thursday gave a conditional renewal to the licence of the offshore casino belonging to Golden Globe Hotels Private Ltd (GGHPL). 

 The GGHPL, a subsidiary of former Haryana minister Gopal Kanda’s MDLR Group, had filed a fresh petition for the renewal of licence of the offshore casino.
 
 “The government hereby grants approval of licence to the said licensee subject to the condition,” under secretary (home) Neetal Amonkar said in the order.
 
 The high court of Bombay at Goa on Wednesday directed the state government to consider the application filed by GGHPL seeking renewal of licence for its offshore casino in Mandovi within 24 hours.
 
 The state government has asked the GGHPL to produce statutory documents within 24 hours. “The time of 24 hours flows from the time given by the high court to the government and is a co-shared time frame. As this order issued on March 9, the time frame shall be covered to run from 10am on March 10 and to conclude on 12pm on March 14 as March 11, 12 and 13 being statutory holidays,” Amonkar said in the order.
 
 The order further states that in case the applicant is unable to produce any of the required documents, he should seek specific extension of time along with reason.
 
 She also said that as per the policy decision of the government applicable and as applied to all offshore licensee holders, prior to the issue of any license the verification of character and antecedents of the directors of the said licensee is sought by this department which has not yet been done in the instant case.
 
 In case the petitioner has any material details which have changed post October 7, 2016, the same may be informed by March 14 till 12 noon failing which verification will be done as per the documents already submitted, the order stated.
