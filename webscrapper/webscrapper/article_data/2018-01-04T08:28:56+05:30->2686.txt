 Indore, adjudged the cleanest city in India in the Swachh survey last year, is hosting the state government's ambitious event, Friends of MP, which aims at showcasing the investment potential of MP before foreign investors.
 
 At the inauguration of the event on Wednesday, CM   said: "I said earlier that the streets of MP are better than those in Washington. I will ask the delegates (who have come from the US) to see if Indore is better than Washington (or not)," Chouhan told reporters.
 
 
 
 Delegates (most of whom are NRIs) will find that there are several things better in Indore, the chief minister said.
 
 “They will come and see the cleanliness in Indore. There is no comparison between us and Washington…, we are really better (in cleanliness). The people of Indore, the nagar nigam, the representa and travelled on the road, I felt the roads in Madhya Pradesh are better than the United States... I am saying this not just for the sake of saying.”
 
 His statement triggered controversy and was ridicule by Congress, but he stuck to his stand. Reiterating his statement on his return from US, Chouhan said he truly believes that roads in parts of MP are better than in US, mentioning Indore Super-Corridor in particular.
