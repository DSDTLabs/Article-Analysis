MUMBAI: A Bollywood-style drama interrupted traffic on the busy   flyover on Sunday afternoon when a saffron-clad youth climbed its repair deck and started shouting, though nothing much could be heard 50 metres below on the road.

  After over two hours, with a joint effort of the police and the fire brigade, the man was brought down and identified as  , a Shiv   from Yavatmal on a ‘mission’ to unite the warring Thackeray cousins “for the betterment of Maharashtra”. 
 
  
  
 As the police tried to speak sense to him using a public address system, a crowd gathered to film the drama. Gaikwad was running across the deck and every once in a while appeared to want to jump off. Traffic had to be diverted and motorists, slowing down to catch the drama live, forced by the police to move on. Senior inspector   of   police station said, “Initially, he was shouting in Marathi and then started throwing leaflets.” 
 
 The leaflets revealed Gaikwad’s identity and purpose: unity among Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and MNS chief Raj Thakeray. Dadar fire brigade official Santosh Ingole picked up a leaflet and dialled the phone number mentioned. “I tried my luck. Gaikwad took the call. We tried to convince him to come down, but he refused,” said Ingole. Worse, Gaikwad had locked the entry to the tower’s staircase. 
 
 Finally, the fire brigade used a 42-metre ladder to reach him. After much difficulty, he was brought down around 4.45pm. The police have another challenge from him: Gaikwad has threatened to now go on hunger strike.
