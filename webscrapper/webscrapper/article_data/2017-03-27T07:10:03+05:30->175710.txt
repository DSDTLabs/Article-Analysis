KOCHI: The Kochi corporation is seeking the help of   (CPT) and   to work out a solution to complete the construction of Ro-Ro jetties without stopping the jankar services. They are even considering the possibility of completing the work without carrying out large scale piling works for jetties. 

 "Talks are being held at various levels to bring in Ro-Ro vessels for a trial. Then the experts with Shipyard and CPT will check out the technical aspects of constructing jetties without stopping jankar services," asid Kochi corporation town planning committee chairman PM Harris said
 
 CPT chief engineer G Vaidyanathan said that the local body should take a call on whether to stop jankar services to facilitate construction works. "Works of both jetties will be completed by April 30. We will see whether it would be possible to go ahead with the work without stopping jankar services."
 
 However, experts in marine structures want Kochi corporation and CPT to throw light on the design and the specifications of the jetties as well as details of construction. According to them it would at least take nine months to construct a RO-RO jetty on a war-footing. They are of the view that piling has to done at the jetties for ensuring safe berthing of these vessels.
 
 "The jetties will have to resist quite an amount of horizontal load. So it is necessary to undertake piling works. Corrosion of concrete and steel structures will be higher at estuaries (like  ) and tidal zones or splash zones. As the jetty is being constructed in a region where there is heavy current the authorities will have to undertake special construction works," said an expert in marine structures with Cusat. 
 
 Meanwhile, former town planning committee chairman K J Sohan ruled out the need for obtaining approval from ministry of environment and forest (MoEF) and   (KCZMA) as the RO-RO jetties are being constructed where there is an existing jetty.
