PATNA: RJD’s national vice-president   on Tuesday said prohibition rules would be relaxed if his party came to power in Bihar. 

 “Prohibition will remain in place but severe punishments such as confiscation of house and 10 years’ imprisonment for liquor offences will be removed. If   forms the next government, neither police will use breathalysers nor unnecessarily harass people in the name of prohibition,”   told reporters, adding that it would be incorporated in the RJD manifesto in the upcoming election.
 
 RJD has been speaking against stringent prohibition law since Nitish Kumar parted ways with Lalu Prasad’s party and Congress on July 26 last year and formed a new government in alliance with the   the next day.
 
 RJD chief Lalu and most of his party members have been terming prohibition as an “utter failure”. “Prohibition has been a big failure and a complete flop in the state as home delivery of liquor is happening in Bihar now,” Lalu had said on October 29, after four persons died after consuming spurious liquor in   district.
 
 But the ruling JD(U) alleged the RJD was opposing prohibition owing to its allegiance with liquor mafia in the state. “RJD will not be able to form a government in any eventuality. Besides, such statements issued by Raghuvansh, Lalu and Tejashwi Prasad Yadav show that their party has been taken over and being funded by liquor mafia. That is why they are speaking in their interest and not of people in general. By talking about relaxing the law, RJD is indicating they will allow the bootleggers to run their operations freely. Strict norms are necessary for effective implementation of law like prohibition,” JD(U) spokesperson   told TOI.
