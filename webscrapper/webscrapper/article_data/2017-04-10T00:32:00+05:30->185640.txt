Ajmer: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh   offered prayers at the dargah of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti and chadar (shawl) at the grave of the 12th century Sufi saint on Sunday.

 Accompanied by five Bangladeshi ministers, Hasina reached Ajmer by helicopter. She went to the shrine and was received by officials of the dargah’s Anjuman Committee (management committee). She offered prayers for 15 minutes at the shrine and stayed there for about an hour.
 
 She prayed for prosperity and harmony in her country as well as better bilateral relations with India.
 
 In the visitors’ book, she wrote in Bangla: This is the court of the Almighty and those who come here will receive divine peace. Those who come here have their desires fulfilled and the Almighty hears our prayers.
 
 After landing at the helipad in Ghugra, she went to the Circuit House for rest and then to the dargah. A band welcomed her at the gates. She was received by deewan Zanial Ali Khan of the dargah committee. Her khadim Kamruddin Chishti completed the rituals after her prayers.
 
 Anjuman Committee members also tied a turban to bless her and read a letter in her honour. According to the khadim, she was calm and peaceful. Her convoy later left directly to the helipad.
 
 Among those who accompanied Hasina were minister for liberation war affairs A K M Mozammel Haque, minister of water resources Anisul Islam Mahmud and minister of law Anisul Haq. She had earlier visited the shrine on January 13, 2010 with her family members.
 
 Meanwhile, heavy security arrangements were made for her Ajmer visit. Traffic was blocked and the dargah was vacated in the morning. Because of Mahavir Jayanti, the police had to also manage a procession by the Jain community in the city.
