HYDERABAD: Telangana government got relief when it received much-needed time from the apex court to implement the ban on liquor sale within 500m off national highways. There are 1,156 wine shops and 394 bars spread across three major national highways passing through the state. On Friday,   accepted the argument of Telangana and some states and extended time to implement the blanket ban on liquor sale. 

  As per order, in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, where excise licences are valid till October 1 and June 30 respectively, there will be no ban on highway liquor sales till September 30, 2017. Attorney General of India represented the  .
 
  The state would have landed in a bigger crisis had the apex court refused to extend the deadline. It had to return license fee collected for a period of two years ending on September, 30. The excise department calculated it had to return Rs 2,410 crore which would be a major dent to exchequer in the backdrop of dwindling revenues due to demonetisation.
 
  "Now, there is no such problem. Supreme Court accepted our request and gave time till September 30. We need not return the money to wine shops and bars. Private owners will also find this judgment rational as they would get sufficient time to relocate. We welcome the judgement," RV Chandravadan, excise commissioner of Telangana told TOI. Telangana is particularly happy with the court's decision to reduce the no-liquor zone in local areas with a population of 20,000 or less from 500m to 220m. The state claims most towns and mandal headquarters have less than 20,000 population and says relief given by court will benefit the government in next year's auction.
