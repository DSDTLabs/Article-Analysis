In fact, after this movie’s release, each and every boy will wish to have a father like my character.”

 Charle, who has acted in more than 670 Tamil films, tells us that his role in Maanagaram was challenging. He explains, “It was tough to play a character that has grey shades, rather than, a negative or a positive role. My character in Lokesh’s film had grey shades, which I found it difficult to portray. Most of the actors in the film were fresh faces and it was great working with such young talents. The director used to tell me that my role would be well appreciated after the release. As he said, I got good feedback for my performance.
