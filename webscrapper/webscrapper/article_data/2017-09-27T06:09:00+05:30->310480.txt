Noida: The body of the six-year-old boy, who was thrown into a drain allegedly by his father in an attempted suicide pact in Sector 15A, was fished out of the water on Tuesday morning.

 Some children, living at jhuggis of Sectors 15-16 along   drain, found Mayank’s body floating around 500 metre upstream from the spot where he was pushed into the water on Sunday evening. Later, local residents pulled the body out of the drain and informed his family members and police.
 
 On Sunday, Dharmendra   (32), a jobless man, left home around 7pm, saying that he wanted to take the kids to a Mata Ki Chowki being held in the community centre of Sector 15. On the way, he reached the bridge over Shahdara drain between Sector 15 and 15A, and threw his son Mayank into the water. Then he threw his daughter Eshu, before jumping into the drain.
 
 However, his daughter caught hold of him in the water and clung on to him, forcing him to change his heart at the last moment. Mayank, however, disappeared in the drain.
 
 Dharmendra had apparently gone back into the drain to search for the boy but to no avail. Later, police had deployed five divers but could not trace the boy despite hours-long search operations.
 
 “We received a phone call around 7am (on Tuesday) from a local youth, who informed us that the boy’s body has been found,” said Beena Devi, Dharmendra’s mother.
 
 Meanwhile, the police have booked and arrested   for attempted suicide and causing  . According to police, Dharmendra, who used to work at an eatery in TGIP Mall, had lost his job around two years back. Since then, he was under pressure from his family to find a job.
 
 “An FIR has been lodged against him under sections 309 (attempted suicide) and 304 (causing death by negligence) of the IPC,” Sector 20 SHO   told TOI.
 
 After the post-mortem, police handed over the boy’s body to family members, who performed the last rites on Tuesday evening.
