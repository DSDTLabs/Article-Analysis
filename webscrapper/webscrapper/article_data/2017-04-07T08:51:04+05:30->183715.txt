PUNE: A magisterial court has sentenced a property developer to six months of simple imprisonment for issuing dud cheques to four senior citizens as part of a compensation deal, after he failed to deliver them flats in a scheme developed on their ancestral land. 

 Judicial magistrate first class Vinaya A Desai also directed the developer to pay Rs 6.50 lakh as compensation to each of the four complainants within a month from March 30 when the order was passed.
 
 Soon after the sentencing, the developer Govind Gajanan Jalan, proprietor of Jalan Developers in Narayan Peth moved a bail plea stating that he wanted to file an appeal in the sessions court. "The magistrate allowed the plea by granting him bail. Jalan now has 30 days to file his appeal," lawyer  , who represented the four complainants, told   on Thursday. 
 
 Jalan had twice executed indemnity bonds in March 2013, promising Rs 46 lakh to each of the senior citizens Suresh P Vaidya (73),   (70),   (73) and Shobhana S Vaidya (61) towards compensation. The Vaidyas had signed an agreement with him on October 14, 2002 for the development of a residential scheme on their land at city survey no 859-B in Raviwar Peth. Jalan had agreed to allot them one flat each within two years, but failed to deliver on his promise. 
 
 After prolonged deliberations, he executed the indemnity bonds on March 14 and 18, 2013 and, as a first instalment, issued cheques of Rs 6 lakh each in August 2013. However, when the Vaidyas presented these cheques in their bank, the same were dishonoured in September 2013 owing to insufficient funds. The Vaidyas then issued a demand notice to Jalan, but he did not respond. They filed a summary case under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments (NI) Act against Jalan.
