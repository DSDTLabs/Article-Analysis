NEW DELHI: A five-year old boy was reunited with his mother at   ( ) airport by Central Industrial Security Force ( ) officials who found the child crying near a check-in counter and tracked his mother through CCTV surveillance.

 The incident took place on Sunday morning when CISF officials noticed a boy crying near the check-in counter of Jet Airways. After approaching the boy, he informed that he had   his mother at the airport.
 
 Within minutes, a team was sent to look for the mother, while subsequently a team used CCTV surveillance to track the parent. CISF officials said a passenger was spotted in the footage who appeared to be ‘worried’ and was looking for someone, following which she was approached.
 
 “We have often had cases at Terminal-3 of children going missing as it has a large area and tracking them through CCTV becomes the easiest mode. In this case too, we found the parent on CCTV surveillance as she seemed like she was looking for someone. Once we approached her, she confirmed she was looking for her son and we brought him over,” said a senior CISF official.
