LUCKNOW: A   at a company-owned-company-operated (COCO)   in in Gomtinagar was sealed by district administration as it was found tampered during inspection on Wednesday.

 The   (Indian Oil Corporation) said internal inquiry has been initiated to fix responsibility. The dealership is also likely to be suspended. The Indian Oil pump is located near a popular sweet shop beside the flyover in Vibhuti Khand.
 
 A drive against fuel dealers began on April 27 after special task force of UP police detected large scale anomalies at the Chowk-based fuel station. STF and district administration have been carrying out raids to ensure vehicle owners are not shortchanged. On Wednesday, a team comprising officials of weights and measures department and food and civil supplies department carried out a joint inspection at Shree Filling station which is managed by IOC.
 
 Sharing details, weights and measures department inspector Rishiraj Mishra from said, “Of the four dispensing units, tampering was found in one.” Though quantity of fuel being dispensed was accurate, it was found that the circuit of the machine and pulser assembly of the   had been tampered. The machine was sealed thereafter.
 
 Assistant rationing officer (ARO) Dharmendra Singh said, “A report on the anomaly has been prepared and will be submitted to district magistrate.” Senior manager IOC, M K Awasthi said dealers at COCO retail outlets are given 11-month lease. “The field officer is supposed to conduct quarterly inspections,” he added. Awasthi also said that during inspection if quantity of fuel being dispensed, oil stock register and seal of weights and measures department are found in proper order during visits, the field officer does not check pulser assembly units and that is how the anomaly might have gone unnoticed in previous inspections.
