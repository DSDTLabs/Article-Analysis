Amid the hum of Vedic chants by school students and the teary-eyed faces of devotees, a man with a traditional skull-cap waiting in queue to pay tribute to the Kanchi acharya Sri  , gave an inkling of the seer’s influence over people cutting across religion, faith and castes.

 
 People from all walks of life, including  , a Muslim carpenter, paid homage to the pontiff. He was instantly recognised by junior pontiff  .
 
 
  
 
 “I had made a chair for the mutt and handed it over only this Monday. I was called by the acharya who appreciated my work and also gave me an apple as prasad. I never expected this (his death),” an emotional Naseer said.
 
 Devotees from across Tamil Nadu and   thronged the mutt since Wednesday morning after the mortal remains of the acharya was brought to the mutt, to have their final darshan. There were school children chanting vedic hymns as well as senior citizens with walking sticks in hand, waiting for their turn to pay homage to the acharya.“I met him on Monday and he spoke well and gave me prasad. I came rushing after hearing the news that he was seriously ill, but by then I could only see him in this state,” said M Malathi from Chennai.
 
 
 As a group of veda pathasala students kept chanting ‘Rama Nama’ and slokas in praise of Lord Shiva, a few oduvars pitched in with Tamil songs in praise of Lord Shiva. The hall with photographs of young Jayendra Saraswathi and his guru   triggered nostalgic memories among the elderly.
 
 
 After paying homage to the acharya, the devotees spent a long time looking at the old photos of Jayendra Saraswathi in the hall. “We have visited the mutt several times, but only today we noticed these rare pictures of the acharya. It is an emotional moment,” said N Ganesh of Tiruvannamalai.
 
 
 Preparations are on for construction of the 'brindavan' where the acharya will be laid to rest at 8am on Thursday.
