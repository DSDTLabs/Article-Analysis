PUNE:  , 32, brought the sweetest news for the nomadic tribe which still carries a British-era stigma. Kale, a peon in  , won the civic election as a   candidate from panel number 7 B, becoming the first corporator from her community.

 Kale hails from Solapur and has studied up to standard IX at a school for the community in Yamgarwadi. After marriage, she came to Pune in 2004 and has been working in the college for the past eight years. Besides being an active member of BJP, she has been working for the community since she was 15 years old.
 
 “I never thought I will contest an election. Our community is very backward and we have never even had a sarpanch from the community .But the BJP gave me an opportunity and party workers worked hard for my victory ,“ a soft-spoken Rajashree said.
 
 She has brought up two daughters after her husband left her. “It is a curse in our community ... our men marry several times,“ she said, adding that her victory will encourage more women from the community to assert themselves.
 
 Her first job, Rajashree said, was to raise the issues the community faces. “I will work sincerely and hope my college gives me the freedom and concession to work as a corporator,“ she added.
 
 Her younger sister Rekha Shinde said that in their family of four sisters and a brother, Rajashree was the best.“The victory has brought hope for the community that lives a life of uncertainty in makeshift homes,“she added.
 
 Principal of Garware College, Muktaja Mathkari, said, “Rajashree has always had social awareness and is deeply connected with self-help groups. She had sought permission to contest the elections and we agreed. She is regarded highly among the women of the locality. The 50% reservation made it possible. We will cooperate with her and look forward to her work. We also hope she is successful with a better understanding of social reality.“
