PANAJI: A delectable menu is being whipped up in the recently renovated kitchen of the Costa family on  , Margao, for the homecoming of sorts of the Portugal Prime Minister  , on Thursday afternoon.

 Costa, the first person of Indian origin to lead a European country, will lunch with his paternal aunt 78-year-old Sinikka Jussilainen Costa, his first cousin and her family during his second visit in three decades to his ancestral house where his father and noted writer and poet Orlando da Costa grew up in the 1930s and 40s. 
 
 Considering the magnitude of the event, the family has roped in an executive chef of a starred hotel in Cavelossim, chef Mahesh, who has prepared dishes for the president of Hungary and top Indian leaders, to put together something special all under the watchful eyes of the   officials, of course. There will not be any Portuguese Goan dishes on the menu. Chef Mahesh has instead decided to give Indian dishes a very modern twist for the ‘Gandhi of Lisbon’. 
 
 Antonio Costa’s cousin Anna Kaarina Jussilainen Costa says the family doesn’t want to bore their ‘Babush’ with Portuguese food or Goan dishes since he will be getting these in large doses during his stay in Goa. 
 
 The family has a collection of Orlando da Costa’s books and Anna Kaarina’s husband, Vikram Antao, had fond memories of him raising the toast at their wedding on Utorda beach back in November 1998. 
 
 Orlando da Costa, born in Mozambique, studied at   and at the Liceu Afonso de Albuquerque in Panaji before leaving Goa in 1947 for Portugal where he became a noted poet, novelist, copywriter, even joining the communist party when it was outlawed. 
 
 “We’re all excited and honoured to have him over. Not just us, but the entire neighbourhood is eagerly waiting for his arrival,” Anna Kaarina says.
