AJMER:   ( ) has not yet become active in the  , where it has a solid organizational network and has helped BJP win both Ajmer north and south seats continuously for the last 15 years.

 For its campaign for Ramswaroop Lamba in Ajmer, BJP is relying on ministers, leaders of different communities and their strength in social networking.
 
 According to sources, senior RSS leaders are in a dilemma and have gone ‘soft’ on Congress as they have fielded a Brahmin candidate. Since BJP’s candidate is a Jat, upper caste members of RSS too are not eager to campaign. “A Brahmin candidate is better in terms of education as well as experience,” said a senior RSS leader of Ajmer.
 
 Though CM Raje, ministers and leaders have continuously campaigned for Lamba in Ajmer, senior BJP leaders confirmed that the party may not make much headway without the active support of RSS.
 
 Other than managing the polls, RSS is good in conducting door-to-door and word-of-mouth campaigns. “They have the cadre and system in place. These gave BJP the edge in Ajmer north and south during the last   elections,” said a BJP leader.
 
 Another factor that’s hampering Lamba is that during campaigns, local and senior leaders are asking for votes in the name of party rather than the candidate. “They rarely mention late Sanwar Lal Jat, Lamba’s father, during campaigns and speak of only policies of Prime Minister   and Raje,” added the BJP source.
 
 Though upper caste votes offer hope for Congress candidate Raghu Sharma, party leaders have not been able to channel the full anger against the BJP government in their campaigns. “The good part is that Congress is looking organized and disciplined this time as PCC chief Sachin Pilot has brought in new young faces,” said a Congress source.
 
 But former chief minister Ashok Gehlot’s ‘indifference’ and the party’s lack of influence among the rural vote bank of Rawats, Jats and Malis may affect the chances of Sharma.
