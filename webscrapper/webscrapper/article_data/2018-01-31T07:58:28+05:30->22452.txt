JAIPUR: Honesty and integrity may be much cherished qualities in policemen, but not so much in 11   who were found caught cheating during an inter departmental promotion test conducted on Tuesday.

 The matter came to light when invigilators and senior police officials found that as many 11 head constables were using cheating slips in the inter departmental promotion to for posts of assistant sub-inspector. The   were suspended and an action may be taken against them soon.
 
 The head constables were caught while they were cheating inside the examination hall of a private college on Tuesday.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police, (Headquarters) Gaurav Shrivastav informed TOI that all 11 cops were suspended with the immediate effect. “Usually these examinations are held at police academy, but since it was working day, we organised tests at a college. We found 11 cops cheating during checkings,” he said.
 
 According to Shrivastav, the cops were found to be using unfair meas. “Some of them had brought cheating slips. We immediately suspended the guilty cops because we don’t want good candidates to suffer because of the misdeeds of others,” he said.
 
 The Jaipur police will also issue chargsheets to cops and asked them to out their defence. As many as 250 cops had appeared in the test. The fate of 11 cops now hangs in balance as they might even lose their present posts of head-constable.
 
 The officials said that strict action will be taken against those who were found cheating in tests, “We decided to suspend them on the spot because we didn’t want for them to respond to chargsheets as it would be unfair for other candidates. We want a level playing field for everyone,” said an official.
