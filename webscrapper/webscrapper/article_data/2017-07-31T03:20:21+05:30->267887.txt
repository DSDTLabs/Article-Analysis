MUMBAI: Civil contractor Anil Mandal, who was carrying out renovation work at Shiv Sena leader Sunil Shitap’s flats at the Ghatkopar building that collapsed last week, was remanded in police custody till August 2. 

 Seventeen people had died in the tragedy. “Mandal was paid Rs 1 lakh for the job. He was supervising the renovation work and would look after the workers. He is the key link between the workers and interior designer Ranjeet Agale, who is still on the run,” said a police officer. 
 
 Investigators have written to the   and sought the building’s original sanctioned plan. The two labourers, who have been detained, have told the police that they came to work at the flats in the morning on that day and Shitap visited the site some time later.
