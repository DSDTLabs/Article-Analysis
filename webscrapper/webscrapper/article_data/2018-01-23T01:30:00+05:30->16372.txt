Hyderabad: French industrial software company   Systemes on Monday said it has inked a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) to set up a 3DEXPERIENCE Center at Amaravati at a cost of Rs 309 crore to make students industry-ready in the field of aerospace, defense, automotive and shipbuilding, said a release.

 While the AP government will provide Rs 36 crore in three instalments, Dassault Systemes will invest Rs 273 crore to establish the centre and offer its services at a subsidised fee to the students, the company said.
 
 As part of experiential learning, the 3DEXPERIENCE platform would be made available to the students either on premise or on cloud so that they have first-hand knowledge of operating on the platform.
 
 The center will enhance the employability skills of engineering and polytechnic (diploma) students by providing certification on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform.
 
 “The center will provide industry solution experience training leveraging virtual environment, which replicates the real world industry experience, thus eliminating the industry access constraints faced by students. The center will provide tele-operated learning facility, where needed, to facilitate remote learning as well,” the release said. 
 
 Commenting on the launch, Samson Khaou, managing director (India), Dassault Systèmes, pointed out that the center has been set up as a step to foster innovation and help instill the startup and research culture in AP as well act as a catalyst of growth by making world-class skilled professionals available to key growth sectors for AP and the country.
 
 K Sambasiva Rao, managing director and CEO, APSSDC, said, “Once fully functional, we will offer over 85 courses in aerospace and defense engineering, automotive technologies and marine infrastructure. Dassault Systèmes will bring in their experience and industry knowledge of working across diversified verticals and play a significant role in providing real and virtual demonstrations of modern day engineering and manufacturing.”
