NEW DELHI:   is yet to decide on the future course of action after the Delhi high court’s order to continue with the moderation of marks on Tuesday. However, officials said there won’t be any delay in declaration of the results and added that the board will also consult the   on the matter.

 On April 24, 2017, 32 education boards, including CBSE and council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, in a meeting arrived at a consensus to not spike the marks via moderation. 
 
 HC’s order — that has put an end to the proposal of not moderating marks for the   — “could create new troubles as boards like Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka are already declaring the results,” said a former CBSE chairperson. 
 
 A senior CBSE official said, “The decision on quantum of moderation is generally taken two-three days ahead of the finalisation of the results. So in case we need to ready the results for May 27, which is the target right now, moderation process will be initiated on May 25. We are yet to get the court's order and the HRD ministry will be consulted before the final decision is taken.”
