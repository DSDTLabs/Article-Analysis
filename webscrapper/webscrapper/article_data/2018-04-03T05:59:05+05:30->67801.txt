MUMBAI:   clocked $74 million in revenues for the financial year 2018 compared to $51 million in the previous year. The higher revenue comes at a time when the restaurant-discovery and   is competing fiercely with   to get a larger share of the online ordering market.

 The company's founder & CEO   wrote in a blog post on Monday that Zomato had clocked 45% growth over the previous year with its operating burn coming down to $11 million compared to $15 million earlier. Cash burn is a measure of the negative money flow incurred largely on discounting and marketing for consumer internet startups.
 
 "Food ordering comprised as much as 30% of our revenues, up from 18% in financial year 2017. We hit 5.5 million monthly food orders in March 2018," Goyal said. "We demonstrated that our business can generate profits - almost all throughout the year. We hit ebitda break-even globally, across all our business, and while maintaining good growth levels. And then, in the last two months, we decided to double-down on growth."
 
 Backed by  's affiliate Ant Financial, Zomato recently raised a $200-million round, which valued it at over $1billion.
 
 Goyal had tweeted earlier that Zomato hit $100 million in annual revenue run-rate, largely due to the growth spurt it registered in the past two months. Significantly, the months of February and March saw the company spend heavily on marketing with as much as $6 million of cash burn, as Goyal mentioned in his blog post on Monday. Currently, Swiggy and Zomato are both in the market to pick up fresh funds.
