CHANDIGARH:   is likely to lessen the tension of overworked PGI doctors. 

 The Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) on Sunday held a meeting with the Cinema Association of City to work on a plan to screen movies of the famous actor.
 
 "We had promised to show a movie once a month to doctors on the campus. We are holding talks with the association. We plan to start with a series of movies on Charlie Chaplin," said Dr Sombir Singh, association president.
 
 There are 1,200 resident doctors in PGI. The sitting capacity at   is 1,000. "The movies will be shown in the auditorium once a month. The idea is to keep humour alive when we are so overburdened with work. If all works well, we shall start showing the movies soon," said Dr Sombir.
 
 The show timings will be such that most can watch the movies. "Weekends are comfortable and those who are posted in the emergency can see them the next day," said a doctor. "This new facility within the campus will be convenient to take our family for an outing," said a senior resident doctor. 
 
 The new panel of the association formed in May this year has also started a swimming pool for doctors and their family. "We started the pool last month. There are still pending issues like resident doctors' lounge in  ," said Dr Sombir.
 
 Presently, doctors have been demanding   in the hostels. Most prefer comfort to recreational facilities.
