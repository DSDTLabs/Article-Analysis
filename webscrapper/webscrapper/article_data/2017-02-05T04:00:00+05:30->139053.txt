Surat: Vijay Mangukiya, an activist of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) who was accused of throwing ink and water on Rutvij Patel, state unit chief of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM), was arrested by police here on Saturday. Mangukiya was picked up from Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER) where he was admitted for treatment of his injuries. He was released on bail by a local court which rejected the policeâ€™s request for his custody to investigate the case. The police wanted to interrogate Mangukiya to know if it was a planned move by them to target BJYM rally.

 Mangukiya was admitted in the hospital on Tuesday last after he was allegedly thrashed by some BJYM members subsequent to being caught while throwing ink at BJYM leaders in a rally. PAAS members had targeted the BJYM rally from different points but Mangukiya was caught and thrashed for his act. He was among the 19 booked as accused by Sarthana police of whom 18 were later arrested. Mangukiya was not arrested then as he was in hospital.
 
 Mangukiya was kept in a lock-up at Umra police station since the police found it risky to keep him at Sarthana police station where the offence was registered. The police feared violence as Sarthana is a Patidar-dominated area, sources said. Meanwhile, PAAS members spread rumours that Mangukihya was kidnapped from the hospital when the police took him away after his arrest.
