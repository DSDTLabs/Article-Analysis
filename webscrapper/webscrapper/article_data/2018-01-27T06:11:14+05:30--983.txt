BENGALURU: Two bike-borne miscreants cocked a snook at city policeby snatching a woman’s handbag with Rs 1 lakh cash in it when she was travelling in an autorickshaw bang in front of the city police commissioner’s office early Wednesday.

 Diana Vaz, a resident of Lakshmipuram, Ulsoor and a hotel employee, lodged a complaint with   police. The incident took place at 3.40am on Infantry Road when the woman was heading towards her residence from   bus station, police said.
 
 “I came to Bengaluru from Kodagu in a bus and took an autorickshaw from   Junction. The auto drove through Race Course Road and entered Infantry Road,”   said in her complaint.
 
 We were somewhere near the police commissioner’s office and I was about to drink water, when two bike-borne men wearing helmets came closer to our vehicle next to Syndicate Bank ATM kiosk (which is on the premises of the commissioner’s office). The pillion rider snatched the vanity bag which was on my lap before the bike sped,” she added.
 
 She told police the bag contained property documents, bank passbook, ATM card, driving licence, PAN card and Aadhaar card and also Rs one lakh cash.
 
 Police said the auto driver chased the bike, but he failed to catch up with them. “Prima facie the drive looks innocent, but we can’t rule out anything at this point. We have asked him to appear before us whenever summoned,” a police officer said.
 
 Police said the miscreants were on a sports bike and took a left turn on Infantry Road near   junction before entering Cunningham Road.
