NAGPUR: Maskasath-based merchants, comprising traders of Areca nuts and groceries, staged a dharna on road on Wednesday protesting against the nexus of some lower rung politicians and goons running extortion rackets by threatening action by police and other government departments. They also observed a one-day bandh. 

 The traders’ agitation was also supported by auto-rickshaw drivers and owners, apart from women workers. The protest was called off after some sloganeering but they continued with the bandh suspending their business highlighting their harassment. 
 
 A trader in the area was harassed by some local politicians and goons at Chikhli on Tuesday which prompted the protest. The traders also submitted memoranda at Tehsil, Lakadganj and Kalamna police stations regarding the incident. They claimed they had approached the city police chief a couple of months ago with their grievance. The situation hasn’t improved even then. 
 
 One of the protestors   said representatives of various outfits, along with goons, barge into the establishments threatening to initiate a raid by police or   (FDA). “They demand money to stop it. Today’s dharna was a message but from now on we would collect evidence and file complaints,” he said.
 
 Another trader   said goons misbehaved in presence of women workers and intimidate them. “These goons suddenly turn up with a mob of 40-50 people and disrupt the business,” he said.
 
 Zonal DCP   said traders had never reported any such matter to him. “Police would never step into a merchants establishment to check materials. I would take action against any cop who would do that,” he said.
