LUCKNOW: Continuing to offer the party ticket to outsiders, the BJP might welcome Rajya Sabha member  's son Rakesh who is the SP candidate from Kaiserganj. If Beni's son would join the BJP it would be the second major setback to the SP, the first being Ambika Chaudhary joining the BSP two days back. 

 Beni Prasad Verma, a prominent Kurmi leader with influence in the area around Bahraich, had joined the SP after parting ways with the Congress which he had joined following his estranged relations with former SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav. After his return, Beni was made Rajya Sabha member in 2016. Before the family feud in the Yadav clan had intensified, then SP chief   had given the party ticket to Rakesh from Ramnagar in Barabanki district. However, chief minister   shifted Rakesh from Ramnagar to Kaiserganj which is the home town of Beni Prasad Verma. Apparently unhappy with his son being shifted to Kaiserganj and minister Arvind Singh Gope getting the party ticket from Ramnagar, Beni is believed to be in a mood for a new political shelter.
