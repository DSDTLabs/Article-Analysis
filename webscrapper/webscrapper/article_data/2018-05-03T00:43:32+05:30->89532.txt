 Predictions took the expected course as   and   SC booked their place in the final of the Goa   with comparative ease.
 
  At the Duler   Stadium in Mapusa, Sporting Clube missed at least half a dozen gilt-edge chances, and survived some close calls too, but eventually trooped out 2-0 winners against Salgaocar FC. An hour later, Churchill took on minnows Guardian Angel SC and, predictably, had no problem defeating them 5-1 on Wednesday.
  
  Sporting Clube and Churchill Brothers will now clash in the final at Bambolim on Friday.
  
  The first semifinal should have gone either way, given the number of chances that both teams created and missed in the opening minutes. Sporting Clube’s Nigerian striker Philip Odogwu and Salgaocar’s Umesh Harijan were both guilty of missing easy chances to give their team the lead, and following a spate of missed chances, there was a sudden flurry of goals for Sporting Clube.
  
  The first came in the 40th minute, thanks to a lovely move initiated by Alesh Sawant who found Glan Martins inside the box. The Sporting captain was smart enough to spot Marcus Mascarenhas and the striker made no mistake with a brilliant finish.
  
  Sporting’s second came at the stroke of half-time. This time, the goal came from a corner-kick as Phillip rose high to flick home Cajetan Fernandes’ measured delivery.
  
  Captain Glan was named the Man-of-the-Match for his super show in midfield.
  
  In the second semifinal, Churchill proved too good for Guardian Angel.
  
  Nigerian Francis Okechuku opened the floodgates at the half-an-hour mark and then scored another in the second session. It didn’t matter that Guardian Angel had got the equaliser immediately through Aslon Oliveira.
  
  The other goals for Churchill came from the boots of Uttam Rai, Alber Gonsalves and Rohan Adnaik.
  
  Alber was named the Man-of-the-Match.
