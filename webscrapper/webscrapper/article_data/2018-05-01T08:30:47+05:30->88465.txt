CUDDALORE: A 27-year-old Chennai-based engineer consumed poison and slashed his girlfriend’s throat with a knife on the Annamalai University campus in   on Monday morning, allegedly angry that she had broken off their relationship. Passersby and students who saw P   attacking M Lavanya hurled stones at him before handing him over to the police.

 While Lavanya, a 23-yearold second year agriculture student, is being treated at the Rajah Muthaiah Medical College where she is said to be out of danger,   is set to be discharged from the   where he was taken after the incident.
 
 The police said Naveen, a native of a village near Nattrampalli in   district, and Lavanya, resident of a neighbouring village in the same district, knew each other for the past six years.
 
 A few days ago, a quarrel broke out between the two and the girl decided to break up the relationship, a police officer said. She had stopped talking to him and also refused to take his repeated phone calls, he added.
 
 Naveen arrived in Chidambaram on Monday morning and immediately reached the girls’ hostel on the Annamalai University campus. Soon, he saw Lavanya walk out of the building along with a few friends. They were on their way to attend classes.
 
 Naveen, witnesses later told the police, ran in front of her in an attempt to stop her and began a conversation. But as she passed him and began walking, he drew out a knife and viciously slashed her and she slumped to the ground. Passersby and students managed to overpower Naveen and handed him over to the police.
 
 Police, who booked him under IPC Section 307 (attempt to murder), said he planned to end his own life after killing Lavanya and had consumed poison. Investigators will produce the youth before a local court as soon as he is discharged from hospital.
