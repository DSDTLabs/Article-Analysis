NEW DELHI: The much delayed   of   won’t be functional any time soon. The line, which was scheduled to start in March, is still awaiting the date for a safety inspection. The request for the inspection was submitted to the commissioner of Metro rail safety in mid-March. 

 The Heritage line was to become fully operational last year but was delayed because of various reasons, including technical challenges faced during construction at   and Kashmere Gate. While the section from   to ITO opened last year, the rest — ITO to   — has been inching towards completion for months now.
 
 In March, DMRC announced the integration of the signalling system from the existing operational section to the rest of the delayed line, enabling the operation of trains on the entire corridor. However, before the line can become operational, a safety audit is mandatory.
 
 Sources said that once the audit is complete, the corridor will be opened for commercial operation almost immediately. “The audit date needs to be fixed first, followed by the inspection and any clarification that the commissioner of Metro rail safety may have,” explained the official. Sources said that the commissioner had not responded till now.
