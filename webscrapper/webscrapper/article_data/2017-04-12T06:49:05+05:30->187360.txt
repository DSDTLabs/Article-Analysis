NEW DELHI: On a day the   government in UP took a bouquet of decisions to improve electricity supply, Union power minister   said a white paper was needed to expose the “deep rot” of the past 15 years in the state's power sector.

 “Some of the statistics which came out in last two weeks are mind-boggling and terrible. 
 
 I cannot even share it with you... Some of the figures and statistics that have come out, have strengthened my feeling that we should come out with a white paper on state of affairs in UP so that the people know that deep rot that has been set into the system for the past 15 years,” Goyal said after launching a scheme to monitor rural feeders and ‘Urja Mitra’ app for real-time tracking of blackouts.
 
 Coming a day after Goyal read the riot act to UP power department officials and asked them to shape up or ship out, his statement on Tuesday is a clear indication that the Centre will not cut any slack in improving power supply in the state.
 
 The state saw a high-decibel war of words between the BJP and   over electricity supply.
 
 While the BJP claimed darkness all around, the SP hit back with claims of 24-hour supply to Varanasi, PM  's   constituency.
