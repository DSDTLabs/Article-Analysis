Mumbai: The   has asked a public prosecutor to examine and state why three men convicted of raping a minor girl in 2012 and sentenced to 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment should not be   as they were denied an opportunity to cross-examine several witnesses during trial.

 The convicts’ case was that they were denied a fair trial. 
 
 Justice A M Badar was hearing an appeal by Kumar Devendra (38), Sadeep Irla (27) and Om Gaikwad (33) convicted by a   on December 23, 2013, in a 16-year-old’s   in a hutment area in Wadala. The crime was registered by Wadala TT police in June 2012. There were originally six accused, three were acquitted. The appeals were filed in 2014—only Devendra and Irla had sought bail. 
 
 Counsel Nandkumar Sawant, for Irla and Gaikwad, and Farhana Shah, appointed legal aid counsel for Devendra, cited several SC judgments to impress on the HC that even “at this stage itself, all accused need to be acquitted by quashing the impugned judgment of conviction as the sessions judge had convicted them without giving proper opportunity of cross-examining   witnesses, including the alleged victim…” The reason for no cross-examination, the HC observed, was recorded as the “absence” of the defence counsel and inability or refusal of accused to cross-examine the witnesses.
 
 Justice Badar observed that SC has underlined the constitutional guarantee of right to a fair trial and that free legal aid was an essential element of such right. The HC judge said though the advocate for the accused “remained absent, the sessions judge…did not care to inform this constitutional right as well as procedural law to accused persons and denied them right to cross-examine prosecution witnesses”. —Swati Deshpande
