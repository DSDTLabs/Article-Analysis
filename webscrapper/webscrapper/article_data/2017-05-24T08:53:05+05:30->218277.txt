RANCHI: There are no takers for vocational and   started by the Ranchi University (RU). 

 One such is a three-month certificate course on anti human trafficking for postgraduate students of sociology and psychology. 
 
 "Even as the course fee for general category students have kept at Rs 6,500 and Rs 5,000 for students of OBC and ST/SC background, it failed to attract them. Only five out of a total of 30 seats were filled, forcing us to close the course"  's public relation officer PK Jha said. The course was mooted by the Jharkhand State Women's Commission to keep students informed about the ill effects of trafficking. 
 
 Similarly, the university had started courses in Arabic and Persian in its Urdu language department on recommendations of former governors Syed Sibtey Razi and Syed Ahmed. "Both the courses received lukewarm response from the students. But, no one has signed up for these courses yet," Jha added. 
 
 A vocational course on environment and water management at the   was stopped with six months after it was started. "This vocational course was funded by the   and 30 seats allotted for it. I don't know why students stopped taking admissions. They perhaps felt there was no scope for job after completion of the course. It was very important and it is running successfully in other universities," said college principal, Jyoti Lal Oraon.
