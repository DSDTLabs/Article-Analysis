GUWAHATI: The   ( ), an  , said the state government should not carry out any eviction drives in the city as many indigenous people are settled in many of the areas earmarked for eviction. 

 The PVM said many of the indigenous people who have been "victims" of influx will have nowhere to go if they are evicted from the city. "The government should have completed eviction drives in Sipajhar, Palashbari, Mayong and other places where indigenous people are victims of large-scale encroachment by Bangladeshis," PVM convener and senior advocate Upamanyu Hazarika said.
 
 All land under encroachment in rural areas should, instead, be cleared, Hazarika said, adding that any controversy arising out of the encroachment drives should not be used as an excuse to stop eviction in other places.
 
 The state government has, however, clarified that it has no plan for conducting eviction drives on the hills of Guwahati, as has been insinuated. Chief minister   said "misinformation" is being spread. "The government has taken no decision to carry out eviction drive on the hills of Guwahati," Sonowal said.
