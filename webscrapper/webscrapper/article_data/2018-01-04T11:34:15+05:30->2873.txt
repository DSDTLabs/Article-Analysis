TRICHY: In a critical assessment of superstar Rajinikanth’s entry into party politics,   Irrigation Farmer’s Welfare Association (CIFWA) has said that he must first ensure state’s all rights to Cauvery water before floating the party.

 The CIFWA made their stand clear through a representation sent to the personal secretary of the actor on Wednesday. The association asked   to hold talks with   to settle the issue amicably before launching his party.
 
 “The issue had been there even in the Chola period. It was settled in 1924 following an agreement signed by the two states. It remained valid until 1970,” said  , president of Cauvery Irrigation Farmer’s Welfare Association Mahathanapuram.
 
 “The Karnataka government had then constructed a number of dams across the state since 1974, stating that the agreement entered between the two states became void. Even after 26 meetings between the   and Karnataka governments, nothing came out fruitful,” he added.
 
 Later, the Karnataka government refused to release the due share of water from Cauvery to Tamil Nadu, forcing the farming community to sit idle for more than six years. Without water, the farmers could not have started Kuruvai cultivation, he said. “It seems that the samba harvest is uncertain during this year, Rajaram alleged.
 
 “Rajinikanth should prove himself that he would safeguard the interest of the state. For that to happen, he should take an initiative to sort out the Cauvery water issue without affecting the interest of the farmers from both the states,” he added.
 
 Rajaram said that the association wholeheartedly wished success to   for political career. “But if he could not ensure an amicable solution to the long-pending Cauvery water question, he would never shine in politics,” he said. A copy of the representation has been sent to the personal secretary of the actor, Rajaram has stated in his statement.
