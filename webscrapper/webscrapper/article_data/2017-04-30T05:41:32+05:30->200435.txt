MUMBAI: To keep   and parking of vehicles at bay in Andheri, the   has begun the process of planting 1,000 foxtail palm trees around the area which has been taken up by hawkers and occupied by vehicles. 

 BMC's K-east ward authorities said that they had observed a spurt in the number of vehicles being parked illegally along the stretch below the Andheri metro station up to the Western Express Highway. The two streets, Old Nagardas Road and Parsi Panchayat Road, had many unauthorized hawkers selling their wares.
 
 Due to his, only 40 feet of the 60-foot road were being utilized for vehicular movement, causing congestion. The civic authorities therefore decided to bring in 1,000 foxtail palm trees from Hyderabad which are being planted on either side of the road.
 
 A civic official said that red soil has been put around the tree besides surrounding it with a ring. "This is a major link between Andheri metro station and the highway and several people comute along this route," said an official. "We wanted to plant strong trees. We have also tried to surround the trees with concerte rings so that no one sits around it or parks their vehicles."
 
 To maintain the trees, BMC officials said that they have roped in local shopkeepers along this route. The shopkeepers were called for a meeting recently and asked each to take up the responsibility of maintaining these trees by watering them regularly. Also, the advantage is that these plants are very tall and sturdy and therefore we feel that no person or animal will be able to tamper with them by trying to pull down leaves or damage them," said Devendra Kumar Jain, assistant municipal commissioner of the civic ward.
 
 Jitendra Mehta, who has a jewellery shop on the road said that this is a great move by the civic body as they are now hopeful as the plants will now dissuade hawkers from sitting on there.
