CHANDIGARH: As his party’s dissenting MLAs continue to speak against Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar,   high command has put general secretary   on the job of bridging the divide between the two parties.

 Vijavargiya was in charge of party affairs in Haryana ahead of the 2014 state assembly elections, which saw BJP attain power in the state on its own for the first time. A close aide of BJP president Amit Shah, he is going to chair a meeting of the dissidents in New Delhi on Wednesday.
 
 “This is between Vijayvargiya and them (dissidents). Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala and present state in charge Anil Jain too would be there during the meeting,” confirmed Haryana BJP spokesman Rajiv Jain.
 
 Rewari MLA Randhir Singh Kapriwas, who along with   and Barara MLA Santosh Sarwan, have been running a “campaign for being heard by the government of their own party” is hopeful of reaching a solution in the meeting.
 
 “We welcome the move. Let me make it clear that we are not dissidents but a group of people who have waged a war against political and bureaucratic corruption. We want party workers and the common men to be heard. We are implementing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s agenda of weeding out corruption at all levels,” said Kapriwas.
 
 For the past few weeks, close to a dozen BJP legislators have been vocal against the government alleging they were being ignored by bureaucrats, ministers and certain officers in the chief minister’s office (CMO). The matter to a head just before the budget session of Haryana assembly that concluded in the first week of March.
 
 As their dissidence reached the peak, Khattar was forced to convene their meeting at his residence. But things did not work out, and the party high command had fixed their meeting with senior BJP leaders in the second week of March. Situation has been the same ever since.
