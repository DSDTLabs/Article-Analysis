PATIALA: Punjab’s police officers knew that there might be an attempt to free dreaded gangsters from the high-security   jail a good five months before the jailbreak took place. And it wasn’t just a vague intelligence input. This was stated in an FIR registered on June 3, 2016.

 The FIR, registered at the Kotwali police station, clearly states that the jailed gangsters’ aides,   and three others, may try to free their associates.
 
 The cops made the observations after spotting Romy in and around Nabha along with three others. 
 
 The police station is 1.1 km from the jail. Interestingly, the FIR adds that this information had been wirelessly communicated to the district headquarters and a copy of the report had been sent to the area magistrate.
 
 TOI has a copy of the FIR which states that the men were moving around in a white   City bearing the number PB 11 AX 9515. It was also established that the number plate was fake and the car could have been a stolen one.
 
 On November 27, 2016, gangster   and four others had escaped the jail along with alleged   terrorist   after their aides stormed the jail.
 
 The FIR also states that Romy had been noticed by a team of cops just 2km from the Kotwali police station. It has named Jagseer Singh alias Sira, Saraj Singh and an unidentified person. Sira is the elder brother of Kulwinder Singh, who was arrested from a village in Moga with Sekhon. 
 
 The police knew that Romy had returned from Hong Kong — TOI had reported on Tuesday that he was living there — and was providing the gangsters money. 
 
 He was also managing the gangsters’ investments. The cops had put on record that if these men are traced and arrested, a ‘major (crime) event’ could be averted.
 
 SSP S Bhoopati said the FIR was not in his knowledge but admitted that there could have been some loopholes in the system. DIG   range   said they were checking to find out about the action taken after the FIR was registered.
