VADODARA: Hoardings hailing senior   leader   as the chief minister of the state irrespective of   or Congress coming to power sent political circles into a tizzy on Monday in Vadodara. Nobody claimed to have put up the hoardings till Monday night.

 The hoardings signed off by merely station ‘Amo Gauravvanta Gujaratiyo (We Proud Gujaratis)’ state that the government of Bapu (nickname used for Waghela) would be in the interest of all. They have the picture of Waghela with the background of an ornate throne-like chair.
 
 The hoardings generated a lot of interest as Waghela is believed to be trying hard to be named as the Congress candidate for the CM’s post.
 
 On Saturday itself reports had suggested that he had left a state core committee meeting with Congress national vice president   midway as his demand for being made the CM candidate was not being met. Waghela had, however, rubbished the reports. He had stated that he had attended the group’s meeting and had also met Gandhi. He claimed that he had left early with prior permission due to personal engagements.
 
 It has been widely speculated that Waghela has been considering returning to the BJP.
