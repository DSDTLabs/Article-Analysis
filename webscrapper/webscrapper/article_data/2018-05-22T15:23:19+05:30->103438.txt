TIRUPUR: A married couple has approached the district administration seeking action against a middleman and a  , who allegedly cheated them of Rs 35 lakh.

 
 In a petition,   Selvaraj of   in   said, “My husband Krishnamurthy was working as construction supervisor. To build a house in  , he availed home loan worth Rs 15 lakh from a private home loan company. Later, to take a business loan, we approached Selvakumar of  , who promised to help to get loan from a nationalised bank. Selvakumar claimed that Silambuselvi, an official working in the bank, would help us.”
 
 During the process, Selvakumar asked Krishnamurthy to sell the house to Bhavani. “Since he said that it will help to get the loan, we did so. Though we sought a business loan, Silambuselvi and Selvakumar said they could grant only a home loan. The bank was ready to give Rs 35 lakh as loan and we took it. We transferred Rs 15 lakh from that amount to the private home loan company and paid off the loan,” said Krishnamurthy.
 
 “Selvakumar had demanded 2% commission for his help but did not allow us to withdraw the remaining loan amount from Bhavani’s account. Selvakumar, who had obtained blank cheques from her, withdrew the amount. When we questioned about it, Silambuselvi and Selvakumar were ready to help us get a loan under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana (PMMY). But without our knowledge, loans worth Rs 10 lakh each were sanctioned in our names, and another Rs 20 lakh was also stolen. We came to know about it only when the bank officials visited our house to get the monthly repayments,” the couple claimed.
 
 They wanted the district administration to take action against Silambuselvi and Selvakumar and prevent their house from being seized.
