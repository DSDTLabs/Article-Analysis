The ultimate fashion queen of Bollywood, 
  knows how to make a style statement with her sartorial choices. She is one of the actresses in the B-town, who has redefined fashion in India. From wearing international designers to trying out the latest runway trends, she's a true style diva.

 
 The actress is currently promoting her upcoming movie and just like every time, her style gets to our notice. This time, the fashionista introduced us to a new kind of bottom wear. Styled by her sister Rhea Kapoor, her latest look is quite cool and refreshing. 
 
 She was seen wearing a grey sweatshirt paired with  , a hybrid of tights and boots. They might look weird at first, but this invention by Balenciaga surely is a cool fashion trend for the New Year. The stretchy fabric fits like second skin and offers a skintight look. After the season's favourite thigh-high-boots, this new design is quite appealing to all the fashionistas out there!

 The idea of pantashoes can be dated back to a 1960s design called Pan-T-Boot, which were something like hosiery tights with attached boots. However, they did have a problem of slipping down, unlike the new design of pantashoes. The spandex fabric stays put and has a fly button just like any pants. Genius, isn't it?
