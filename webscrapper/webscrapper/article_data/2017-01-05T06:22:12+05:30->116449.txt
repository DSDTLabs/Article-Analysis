NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday agreed to examine a plea by Federation of Indian Airlines ( ) challenging the government's proposal to levy Rs 7,500 to Rs 8,500 per flight operated by Indian carriers to create fund to develop  .

 “Pleadings are complete in the matter. List it for hearing on February 1,“ a bench of Chief Justice G Rohini and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal said during a brief hearing where FIA's counsel told the bench that the matter should be heard as authorities have started demanding money from the airlines.
 
 FIA expressed fears that the Centre may coerce its members into paying the fee even as the matter is pending in court. However, the HC refused to grant any interim stay and said it would hear arguments on February 1.
 
 The   and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ( ) had earlier defended the proposal and termed the FIA's plea as “misconceived“, saying it would eventually lead to growth of civil aviation sector as a whole.
 
 The ministry and DGCA, in a joint affidavit, had claimed that the scheme was in the long-term interest of the air transport sector and to further widen the penetration of air services in the country. The federation has argued that while the scheme allows it to pass on the levy to the passengers, it cannot do so as it is not a fee for which the carriers are rendering any service to flyers.
 
 FIA, which represents scheduled carriers like Indigo, Jet Airways, GoAir and SpiceJet, has also sought quashing of the October 21 notification inserting the rule for imposing the levy as well as the November 9 order declaring rates of the levy and the categories of the scheduled flights on which these would be imposed.
 
 It has also said that the levy would put an “immense financial burden“, estimated between Rs 388 crore to Rs 532 crore or more per annum. It also sought orders prohibiting the   from collecting the levy.
