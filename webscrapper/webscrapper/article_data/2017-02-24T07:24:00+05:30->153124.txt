New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked the special investigation team (SIT) probing the 1984 anti-Sikh riots to inform it about the timing of each FIR lodged against Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for the alleged killings.

 “You (SIT) must have investigated the cases involving the respondent (Kumar) here. Therefore, you must be aware of the timings of FIR lodged in connection with the cases against him (Kumar) and others,” Justice S P Garg said.
 
 The timings of each FIR were called for as Kumar is an accused in several anti-Sikh riot cases and the court had expressed concern on how a person could be involved in each one of them.
 
 The court also directed SIT to produce the copy of a trial court judgement by which Kumar was acquitted of all charges. It further directed the investigating team to show the copy of charge sheet filed against Sajjan Kumar and others in connection with the killings on the people in 1984.
 
 It said the documents shall be produced on March 14, the next date of hearing.
 
 The directions were issued to the agency after it failed to inform the court about the timing of the two FIRs out of 10, lodged against the Congress leader.
 
 Appearing for SIT, additional solicitor general (ASG) Sanjay Jain informed the court that 10 FIRs were registered in Delhi against Sajjan Kumar after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
 
 He submitted before the court that the timing in each of the FIRs were different, which pointed towards the involvement of the Congress leader.
 
 The ASG made the submission during hearing of its application seeking cancellation of the anticipatory bail granted by the trial court on December 21 last year in a case of killing of three Sikhs. PTI
