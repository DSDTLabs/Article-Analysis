 Rahman’s brilliance shines through as the music evokes spirits similar to the ones that true-blue Sachin fans used to feel when they watched the Master Blaster show his skills on the field. It encapsulates the energy and the emotions of the iconic player’s journey. Take a bow Rahman, for creating this goosebumps-inducing track. The Academy Award winner had created 14 versions of Sachin Sachin for the biography.
