'Oonchi Hai Building', 'Tan Tana Tan' and 'Ek Garam Chai Ki Pyaali' are the three songs   can self admittedly never leave out of his set list for live performances. "College students start screaming if I miss out on any of them. These chartbusters have survived the test of time," the composer-singer exults. Anu has another reason to rejoice as the makers of 'Judwaa 2', a sequel to the 1997 hit, have asked him to not only sing two of the tracks but also tune them to present-day sensibilities. "When I was recording 'Oonchi Hai Building', it was as if the clock had turned back. To re-create the feel, I played the harmonium while I sang, like I had done in the original. Sandy, who has worked with me and David bhai (director  ) was brought back as the sound programmer too. We have merged two antaras into one long chunk for the new song and made the beats catchier," Anu explains.

  
  
 Last week, while the recording was mid-way, David entered the studio and screamed, "You are nailing it!", distracting the shoot and leaving the team in splits. Later, when the final track was sent to producer  , he called back to say that his wife Wardha had already begun dancing to it and he couldn't resist shaking a leg too. "With both David and Sajid, it is an instant hit. If they suggest changes, it means they didn't enjoy it," Anu points out, adding that later this month, choreographer-duo, Bosco and Caesar, will be shooting the new version in London with  ,   and  .
 
 "We will be re-working 'Tan Tana Tan' as well. I've known Varun since he was four and it's a pleasure to sing for him when he's a superstar today. Now, sone pe suhaga will be for Salman to walk onto set and shake a leg to recreate the magic from 20 years ago," Anu signs off.
