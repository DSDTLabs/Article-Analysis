LUCKNOW: A month after it said that   was compulsory for admission to postgraduate courses,   on Tuesday issued a press statement stating that the instruction had been uploaded as a guideline by mistake. 

 In March, the   has put an interim stay on Aadhaar requirement while filling application forms of various competitive examinations. 
 
 The LU PG admission process that began on April 2 directed candidates to submit Aadhaar or at least its enrolment number as a mandatory clause for filling the application form. 
 
 However, realizing the blunder, the university authorities woke up a month later to clarify that Aadhaar was not mandatory and that it was by mistake that the form filling guideline carried the instruction of compulsory entry of Aadhaar number.
 
 "Aadhaar is not compulsory in the online application process of Lucknow University. Inadvertently, there was an oversight in the admission form filling guidelines regarding this and this error has been corrected. No forms would be rejected if Aadhaar is not given," said LU spokesperson  . 
 
 He added that the necessary changes which created confusion around the issue had been made.
