HYDERABAD: A major episode of a crater in front of NTR Gardens, a tourist destinations, was averted after Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) officials noticed a gap beneath the earth during ‘rehabilitation’ of a sewer trunk main through ‘cured in place in pipe’ ( ) technology.

 
 Officials also found severe damage to the pipeline network at eight places. Had the CIPP technology not been used to lay new pipeline, at least eight craters would have been formed. One of them could have been huge. The 1,800 mm diametre pipeline runs for 1.6 kms.
 
 
 
 
 In September 2016, a crater had appeared in front of NTR Gardens after a portion of a decades-old 1,800 mm diametre sewer trunk main was damaged. As a result, the road caved in and traffic movement was disrupted.
 
 
 “Had we not taken up the rehabilitation work, several incidents of road cave-in would have occurred. During our inspection of sewer trunk main, we identified damage at eight locations. In one place, we noticed a hollow portion on the sewer trunk. The upper portion of the pipe was damaged. We have rectified the damaged portions. The CIPP technology is trenchless in nature,” HMWSSB deputy general manager STP-Division-III ( ), M  , told STOI.
 
 
 CIPP’s objective is to rehabilitate the sewer main to increase the structural capacity of the sewer, protect the internal surface of the sewer from chemical and biological attack from sewage environment in a tropical climate. It enhances the lifespan of sewer, Manohar said.
 
 
 Over 90% of rehabilitation works were completed and works pertaining to reconstruction of manholes are going on briskly. By next week, the entire project taken up CIPP technology will be completed, said the official. For the first time, CIPP technology is being used for sewer work.
