Surat: Member of Passenger Service Committee (PSC), Ministry of Railways, Rakesh Shah has demanded thorough inquiry against staff members of mobile squad of Vadodara division for allegedly checking tickets of passengers alighting from trains at Surat railway platform. In a complaint sent to DRMs of Mumbai and Vadodara, Shah stated that he had gone for PSC inspection at Amritsar and arrived at platform number one at Surat by Swaraj Express on March 1, when he spotted two ticket checkers of the mobile squad stationed at the platform who were checking the tickets. Since the faces were unfamiliar, Shah inquired with the railway staff on the platform and they informed him that the ticket checkers were from Vadodara division.  Shah stated that only two squads in the railways—CCM and Railway Board squad-- have the right to check tickets from the passengers.  The staff members of Vadodara division have no right to check tickets from the passengers in other division.  Rakesh Shah told TOI, “It is learnt that the two staff members from Vadodara division checking tickets at Surat station are holding high posts in the railway union and are enjoying the support of senior officers. I have asked the DRM of Vadodara and Mumbai whether staff members of a particular division had the right to check tickets of passengers in other division”  Shah added, “If I don’t get a favourable reply from Vadodara and Mumbai DRMs, then the issue will be taken up to railway minister Suresh Prabhu for his intervention.”
