 Others like Syed Nabi, an activist from Arsh Mahal area, who works on government schemes, pointed out that similar cases have been noticed in which persons not employed by the revenue department approached applicants. “We approached the   with an oral complaint of this activity . In this case it was a lady who claimed to be a revenue official. She was on the phone with us. But the minute we said that we are from the mandal office, she switch off her mobile immediately.“ Activist S Q Masood, another activist from Old City, said that several applications filed with the required documents, a year back, are yet to be cleared.“Shahnaz Begum submitted her documents five months ago. Her 'marriage ID' is 2016SM16055046. While sanction orders were issued, the funds are yet to reach her,“ he said.
 
 Another such case is that of  , a resident Doodh Bowli. While her application has been registered, there is no further movement of the file.
