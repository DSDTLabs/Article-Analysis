JAIPUR: Despite the vigilance of local people, instructions from the district collector and even a   notice, work has concluded on the erection of two new windmills close to the boundary of the   in Jaisalmer district. These mills are coming up in the flight path of the Great Indian Bustard, locally called godawan. Forest officer Anoop KR, who is in charge of the DNP, said, “The permanent solution to the problem of windmills in the flight path of the godawan is to replace those that already exist and prevent new ones from coming up. The collector had earlier instructed the private firm that has been erecting these mills to halt work. Our staff had inspected the premises and we found no work occurring at the time of inspection.”

 Local people, however, say that work was likely undertaken at night too. Virender Singh, a resident of Jaisalmer who often tours the area, told TOI, “Villagers are alert now and the media too has taken up the matter but the private firm seems to be going right ahead. Work was halted by the district collector some while ago, at a stage when two pillars for windmills were still in the process of being erected. I was surprised to find that the mills now have blades on them!”
 
 In September last year,   barred the erection of windmills near DNP to prevent disturbance to godawan in their flight path. As work on the mills continued, collector   had intervened to enforce the ban just weeks ago. Sharma told TOI, “We have already issued orders to this private firm,  , which is putting up the mills. The firm is itself a party in the case in court. After issuing orders the last time, I reiterated the ban on erecting the mills even days ago. The problem is that the NGT orders too are not so clear on the area in which windmills are barred. We are doing everything to enforce the NGT order.”
