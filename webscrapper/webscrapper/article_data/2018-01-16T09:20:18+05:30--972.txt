SHIMLA: The  , which is gearing up for the 2019 parliamentary election, believes that it lost the assembly election in   due electronic voting machines (EVMs) and not because of infighting, factionalism or presence of rebels. In a memorandum submitted to the  , state party leaders have alleged that the EVMs were tampered with and have also demanded that elections be held with ballot papers.

 To discuss the reasons that led to the defeat of the Congress, a meeting was recently held in Shimla where state Congress president   said a big question mark had been raised on the entire election process due to tampering with EVMs. He added that unexpected results on some seats had further strengthened their belief.
 
 For the first time EVMs and voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) were used for voting at all 7,525 polling stations ofthe state. To conduct elections peacefully and to ensure the safety of EVMs, 17,850 personnel of police and home guards besides 65 companies of para-military force were deployed across the state.
