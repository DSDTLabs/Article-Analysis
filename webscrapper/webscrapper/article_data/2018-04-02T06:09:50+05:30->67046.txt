KOLKATA: A resident of   was seriously injured after she was hit by a car on EM Bypass at Chingrighata on Sunday evening. The driver managed to flee with the vehicle. 

 Locals blocked the Bypass corridor to protest against the accident. The agitation lasted about 20 minutes as heavy rains accompanied by a squall dispersed the crowd. The accident brought back memories of the mob fury that occurred on February 3, in which two college students were mowed down by a bus at Chingrighata Crossing.
 
 According to witnesses, Jhuma Sardar (50) was crossing the road at 6.55pm and got on the Science City-bound flank just before the Chingrighata bus stop. They said Sardar tried to pass through a gap between two pedestrian barrier installed on the median divider. The private car was coming from the Ultadanga end and hit her before fleeing the spot. Sardar was rushed to NRS hospital.
 
 The vehicle could not be traced. Officers of the Beliaghata traffic control said cops were busy with a VVIP convoy that was on the opposite flank at that time. "Chingrighata crossing is covered by   cameras. However, the accident spot - which is barely 150 metres from the crossing - does not have cameras. This is why the car could not be identified," an officer said.
 
 After the February 3 accident, the   and the Bidhannagar Police, along with traffic and transportation engineers of the   had conducted a joint inspection of the Chingrighata and Swabhumi-Kadapara ( ) crossings. They suggested a slew of changes for the three main crossings on EM Bypass - Chingrighata, Beliaghata and Swabhumi-Kadapara (Hyatt). These included separate lanes for pedestrians and cyclists, shifting the traffic signal posts and two foot overbridges with escalators.
 
 However, cops said jaywalking persists on EM Bypass. To prevent this, pedestrian barriers have been installed on the road divider. Plans are afoot to set up pedestrian barriers on both sides till Garia.
