PATNA: The   (  and Jharkhand) in CBSE Class XII exams, the results of which were announced on Saturday, fell to 70.54%, a sharp dip of 4.06% when compared to last year’s 74.60%. Even in 2013, the overall   was 74.44%.

 
 Teachers have attributed the sharp dip in pass percentage to several reasons. “These days, students opt for lesser known schools where attendance is not mandatory. This helps them to join coaching institutes to prepare for competitive examinations. However, the coaching institutes do not prepare the students for board exams. As a result, the students fail to fare well in examinations,” said Rajiv Ranjan Sinha, principal of Baldwin Academy and CBSE city coordinator.
 
 The no-detention policy up to Class VIII under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, according to Sinha, is another reason why students find it difficult to fare well in board exams. “The central government is planning to amend the RTE Act to allow states to conduct examinations in classes V and VIII and detain students if their performance is poor. Due to the no-detention policy, even weak students with poor basic concept advance to higher classes,” Sinha said.
 
 Abha Choudhary, a senior teacher at  , said the tendency of the parents to let their wards study in coaching institutes instead of schools has taken a toll on their performance in board exams. “It is easier for students with high aptitude to clear exams with little help, but average students need help and a regularised system of education with exams from time to time. Students who opt for lesser known schools only prepare for competitive exams. Coaching institutes too mislead the students and their parents,” Choudhary added.
 
 She said the coaching institutes do not pay attention to NCERT books. “The CBSE Class XII exams are mostly based on NCERT books,” the teacher said, adding when she recently visited schools in Gaya and other districts to conduct oral tests, students could not answer even basic questions.
