PUDUCHERRY: Nine years ago, when a team of researchers from the French Institute of   embarked on a journey to document all the   in  , little did they realise that the deities in some Hindu temples were originally Jain Tirthankaras.

 For instance, the idol believed to be that of Lord Vishnu at a temple in   in   district is actually the idol of the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha, while the huge rock worshipped as Thirumoorthy (an avatar of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva) at a temple in Thirumurthimalai in Tirupur has the image of one of the Tirthankaras cut on it.
 
 The idol at the Pudupair temple is covered with a cloth and worshipped as Lord Vishnu. “Idols of Parshvanatha are easy to identify as they are always in standing posture with a snake on the body,” said K  , IFP photographer and head of the team, which has developed an interactive DVD on 464 Jain sites in Tamil Nadu. Similarly, the rock-cut image of one of the 24 Tirthankaras at the Thirumurthimalai temple was concealed under coats of sandalwood paste.
 
 Apart from photographic documentation of the sites, the project aims to study the architecture and iconography of Jain temples, compile Jain inscriptions, and outline the contribution of Jains to the Tamil language.
