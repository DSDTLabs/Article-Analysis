NEW DELHI: The meeting of NDA allies saw   supremo   Thackeray face strong criticism from another NDA ally for repeatedly lashing out at the central government. Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief   criticized   and his party for speaking against the government openly despite being a partner in the alliance.

 Sources said   pointed out that while there is nothing wrong in being highly critical of any policy, it was improper to keep constantly criticising the alliance, which is in power. He suggested that Thackeray could raise issues within the NDA but his regular diatribes only weakened the alliance whereas all other partners were trying to strengthen it.
 
 Paswan was reportedly complimented by several leaders of NDA after the meeting ended. TOI has learnt that Thackeray was sitting next to Paswan during the meeting, which was attended by leaders of all the 32 allies in the NDA.
 
 Thackeray, who also spoke at the meeting, praised the working of Narendra Modi government and steered clear of raising any issue in the meeting. This was a significant departure from his usual style of politics, sources said. “Since we all have decided that the next general election would be fought under Narendra Modi in 2019, now there is a need to work with unity rather than criticise the government,” said an NDA leader.
