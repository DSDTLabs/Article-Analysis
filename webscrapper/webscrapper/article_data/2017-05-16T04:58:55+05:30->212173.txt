NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday achieved the rare distinction of having 10 women judges out of a total working strength of 38.

 With two women lawyers being sworn in as judges along with two men, the   now has one of the best ratios of women judges in the country. The four judges — Justices Rekha Palli, Prathiba M Singh, Navin Chawla and C Hari Shankar — were administered oath by Delhi high court’s acting Chief Justice  .
 
 The four were appointed as judges by the President after their names were approved by the   and later the central government. Out of the total sanctioned post of 60, the   now has a working strength of 38.
 
 Justice   was one of the country’s leading intellectual property rights lawyer and represented Indian generic drug manufacturer Cipla in its legal battle with pharma major Novartis. She recently appeared on behalf of Union minister   in his defamation suit against Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
 
 Justice Rekha Palli , who was designated as a senior advocate in 2015, was a familiar lawyer for members of the Armed forces whom she represented on several occasions. She argued against discrimination on the basis of gender in the defence services and appeared for the woman who fought for grant of permanent commission to all women officers who were recruited before May 2006 in the Indian Air Force and the Indian Army.
 
 Justices Navin Chawla’s focus as a lawyer was in telecom and broadcasting matters while Justice C Hari Shankar has been a leading indirect tax and service lawyer.
 
 Interestingly, the four new judges will get to sit in each of the four civil side division benches for two days each to familiarise themselves with working as a judge. As per the new roster, Justice C Hari Shankar sat with acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal on Monday while   shared the bench with Justice Ravindra Bhat.
