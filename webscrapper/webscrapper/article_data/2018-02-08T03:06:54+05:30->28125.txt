GURUGRAM:  , an industrial hub that houses around 1,200 industrial and commercial units and receives around 25,000 workers daily, is still waiting for   that were proposed around a year ago. 

 Sources in the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation ( ) said the industrial body had handed over land to MCG for the proposed toilet complexes as well as bus shelters in Udyog Vihar in March last year. But even after a year, the municipal corporation is yet to start work on the twin projects.
 
 Last week, HSIIDC shot off a reminded to MCG, seeking speedy completion of the projects. “It is informed that DTP/HSIIDC (Gurugram) has already forwarded land for public toilets and bus shelters approved by MD/HSIIDC to the executive engineer VI of MCG, who has also been requested to take up the matter on an urgent basis. The further action for construction of public toilets at Udyog Vihar is to be taken by MCG,” reads the letter sent by HSIIDC on February 2.
 
 As per the plans, MCG is expected to build three public toilet complexes and three bus shelters (stops) in the area, along with a 30m-wide road each in Udyog Vihar 1 and Udyog Vihar 2, and in a green belt near Udyog Vihar 4.
 
 The three bus shelters are expected to come up on a service lane of NH-8 near  , near Shankar Chowk, and by the side of the plot no. 328 and 329. Each bus shelter will be three metre wide and nine metre long.
 
 Aseem Takyar, a city-based activist, who has been following up the matter with the authorities, said, “Over 25,000 labourers work in Udyog Vihar. However, there is not a single toilet complex in the area. Women labourers have to walk back all the way home in case they need to relieve themselves. HSIIDC has transferred the land to MCG, which has agreed to fund the projects. But, nothing has happened on the ground.”
 
 AN MCG official said both the projects were in the pipeline and would be taken up in near future.
