AHMEDABAD: As far as AMC is concerned, it seems the government’s slogan of  , Beti Padhao’ is just for show and not meant to be followed. Sheer negligence towards   was visible all over the campus of Shahpur Shala Number 5, 6 where a teacher was alleged to have raped an 8-year-old girl on Saturday. 

 There were no CCTV cameras found inside the school, and the three toilets inside washroom for girls were without doors, depriving the schoolgirls of even a minimum modicum of dignity.
 
 The school authorities display slogans and pictures of ‘right to have education’ but they must not have taken the ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’ seriously, as filth and waste were seen lying all over the campus. There were three toilets inside the washroom for the girl students but it was not in usable condition as the drainage line was choked, and the entire toilet chamber was filled with sewage.
 
 School sources said that the girls have no option but to use the toilets without doors. “This not only compromises human dignity of the girl students, but also shows how apathetic the government is towards the basic needs of girl children while touting ‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan,’ a source said.
 
 Members of AMC’s school board said that they have not installed CCTV in any school under their purview.
 
 For last two years, budget provisions have been made to install CCTV in the schools, but tendering procedure was not initiated. There are 371 Gujarati medium schools and 15 English medium schools in which around 7 lakh students are enrolled. Sources in the school board said that the life and safety of the students can be ensured and crime can be detected swiftly, if CCTV cameras are installed in THE schools.
 
 Pankaj Chauhan, Chairman of school board of the AMC, admitted that not a single school run by AMC had CCTV cameras installed in them. He said that AMC has been considering e-tendering procedure for installation of CCTV.
