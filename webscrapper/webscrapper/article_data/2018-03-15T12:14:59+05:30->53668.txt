TRICHY: DMK Trichy south district secretary KN Nehru asked party men to exercise caution in the upcoming state-wide cooperative societies election, alleging that the ruling party was planning to declare their candidates victorious.

 Meeting the party workers in the city on Wednesday, he said that the ruling party will pressurise the cooperative officers to work in their favour. Alleging that cooperative minister   has already started hatching conspiracy in this regard, Nehru said that they would try all possible ways to reject nominations of DMK candidates. Thus, nomination papers must be filed in an accurate manner to avoid rejections.
 
 Asking candidates to meet the cooperative officers before filing nominations, he asked them to take help from DMK’s legal team as well. “More party members should file nominations for one post so that if one application is rejected, other party men could still be in the race,” he said. Saying that cooperatives elections should be considered a rehearsal for upcoming local body elections, he said and also asked them to start gathering votes from now onwards.
 
 Party men should not be confused over new political entrants like   and Kamal Haasan, said Nehru adding that DMK has 26-28 per cent stable vote share. This is further consolidated by the parties like  , communist and other parties, he said.
