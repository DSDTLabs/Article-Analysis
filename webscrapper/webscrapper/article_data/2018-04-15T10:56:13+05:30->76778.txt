BHOPAL: After rising steadily for a few weeks, prices of petrol and diesel have stabilised at Rs 79.50 and Rs 68.50 per litre this week, apparently under instructions from the Union petroleum ministry not to raise prices of the two commodities, for now.

 The manner in which prices of petrol and diesel were rising in the earlier part of the month, it appeared it will cross psychological benchmark of Rs 80 and Rs 70 per litre, respectively by the second week of April, but it didn’t happen.
 
 Bhopal-based Indian   (IOC) deputy manager Sohail Ansari, when asked why prices have stabilised now and whether oil companies are under instructions not to raise fuel prices for now, said, “Such orders are not given to us. We receive pricing of petrol and diesel from our regional office in Mumbai every day and fix prices of petrol and diesel, accordingly.”
 
 MP Petrol Pump Owners’ Association president   said “This dynamic pricing policy is a farce. Every time, there is an election in a state or some states, prices of petrol and diesel stabilise and then they start rising again. It happened during   election, election in the north-east and is happening again when   is going polls.” He said there appeared to be no link of petrol and diesel prices to international prices of crude as the dynamic pricing envisages to do.
 
 In past one week beginning April 8, petrol price hovered between Rs 79.61 per litre and Rs 79.51per litre and diesel between Rs 68.39 to Rs 68.44. In earlier part of the month and later half of March, prices of two fuels rose 15 to 20 paise per litre per day.
