After seven long years,   show 'Saath Nibhaana Saathiya' is all set to wrap up on July 23. While many feel that the show has run its course and has exhausted every ratings-garnering trick in the book — be it saas-bahu politics, time leaps, murder or the dead coming alive — the lead actress of the show,  , feels that these factors have added to its popularity. 
 She says, “I never thought that it would be a seven-year-long journey. When I replaced  , people were sceptical if I could be  , but here I am! People ask me how I feel about the show wrapping up and I find that question extremely silly, because who will be happy about it? There are some who find saas-bahu dramas regressive, but that’s what people want to see. Otherwise, how will you explain the ratings that our show enjoyed over the years? Viewers want to see a protagonist and an antagonist and the drama that unfolds between them.”
 When 'Saath Nibhaana'… took a time leap a year ago, there were rumours that some actors had quit the show as they did not want to play grandfathers or grandmothers. Interestingly, despite the huge leap, the lead actors never aged. Devoleena argues, “Why should they? A revamp is all about helping the show get popular again. I can’t recall any other show that has enjoyed such a long run with consistently good ratings.”
 Ask the actress about her future plans and she says, “I am recovering from a back surgery and so, I want to rest for a couple of months.”
