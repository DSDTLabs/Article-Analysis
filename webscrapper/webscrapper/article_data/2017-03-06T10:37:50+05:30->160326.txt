VISAKHAPATNAM: Two youngsters died while two other were severely injured when the car in which they were travelling rammed into a tree near BVK College at Visalakshinagar in the wee hours of Sunday.

 The incident occured at around 3.30 am and passers-by informed the police who rushed to the spot to rescue the injured. The police, fire personnel and local people took nearly three hours to bring out the victims from the fully damaged car.
 
 The deceased were identified as Vamsi Bhogaraju (24), a resident of Naiduthota and an IT employee working in Bengaluru, and Shasank Anuwaz (22), a B.Tech final year student of a private college and resident of Madhavadhara.
 
 The injured were identified as   (25), a software engineer from Madhavadhara, and   (22), final year B.Tech student and resident of Daspalla Hills. Behera was the owner and driver of the car. The cops confirmed that the incident took place due to over-speeding, but maintained that they were yet to ascertain drunken driving.
 
 According to the police, the four were returning to the city after a late night party in Rushikonda and took a right turn on the Beach Road towards the highway via Visalakshinagar to reach the national highway. 
 
 The police suspected that they took the turn to avoid the police check-post at Jodugullapalem Junction. They added that the driver might have taken the turn without slowing down and did not notice a speed-breaker. He lost control and rammed a tree.
