CHENNAI: Students appearing for state board exams has reduced by more than 32,000 this year. Nearly half of them have moved to CBSE schools. As per government data, number of CBSE   in Tamil Nadu has increased from 250 in 2010 to 830 in 2018.

 The 260% increase is the   of   to CBSE and few are simultaneously running branches.
 
 Educationists attribute this to introduction of national-level competitive exams like NEET,   and drop in quality of education in the state board education over the years. "The central government has indirectly pushed towards   by making   mandatory," alleged educationist Prince Gajendra Babu.
 
 Ashok Shankar from Tamil Nadu CBSE Schools Management Association said that apart from competitive exams, the knowledge gained through state board education has resulted in this migration.
 
 However, a state school education department official opined that when new textbooks of the revised syllabus are out students would be lured back. . "In another three to four years, these students will migrate back to our schools as they would have realised that we are way better than CBSE‚Äù, he said. Some have even attributed the drop in the rise in students dropping out.
 
 However, the dip in government school enrolment is not in correspondence with the increase in matric school students' population. Growth of matric schools is very marginal this year.
