SURI: Several   organizing committees in   on Thursday resolved to shun open display of   while observing the solemn occasion.
The decision found support in several local imams, activists and intellectuals who took part in the meeting. Among 10 such committees that attended the meeting only one sought for more time to rethink about the decision. The meeting decided to meet again to form a coordination committee, which will form detailed plans to observe Muharram with help of police and administration. The organisers hoped their efforts would be resonated on a broader scale in and around Suri town.
 
 Masudar Rahaman, a former Suri municipality councillor who presided over the meeting, said, “Some local youths like Lutfar Rahaman, Ibrar Alam and others took this initiative. They spoke to the residents of different localities and tried to convince them. Most of the people present in the meeting agreed that carrying arms in Muharram procession is not sanctioned by our scriptures.The senior imams of different mosques too convinced them by quoting from religious scripture that we should not carry arms in Muharram procession.“
 
 Mufti Nazrul Islam, the imam of   mosque, said, “ As per our religious rituals there is no such occasion, Muharram is the name of a month and one day is observed to expresses mourning.This does not support carrying arms in procession. It should be observed through prayers, fasting and offerings. We the imams of the local mosques have discussed the issue. We'll try to convince the Muharram organizers.“ Fazlur Rahaman, imam of  , too appealed the organizers not to carry arms in Muharraam procession.
