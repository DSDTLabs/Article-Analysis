HYDERABAD: Cocking a snook at the   ( ) officials who have been looking for him in the   ( ) case and even got a lookout circular issued, accused Hyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority (HMDA) director   surrendered before the court on Friday. 

 On February 2, ACB sleuths raided the houses and office of director (planning) of HMDA and unearthed disproportionate assets worth Rs 25 crore. 
 
 At around 10.15am on Friday, Purushottam Reddy surrendered before the ACB Special Court in the DPA case. He was sent to judicial remand by the court till March 1. 
 
 Intimated about his surrender, ACB sleuths moved a petition before the court seeking a one-week custody. The court has posted the petition for arguments to Monday.
 
 On Friday, the ACB team opened the Kotak Mahindra Bank's Bowenpally branch locker belonging to  , mother-in-law of Purushottam Reddy's daughter. 
 
 "We have found gold and diamond jewellery weighing about 1.5 kilos. Majority of the gold belongs to Nivedita Reddy but we have found two diamond necklaces weighing about 35 to 40 tolas, which Purushottam Reddy's daughter   wore on her wedding. The two necklaces are worth Rs 1 crore," ACB inspector   said.
 
 Though Nivedita Reddy told the ACB that the entire jewellery belongs to her, ACB sleuths believe that part of it is given by the accused as a wedding gift. 
 
 "We are yet to unearth most of the jewellery linked to Purushottam Reddy," the ACB official said.
 
 While Purushottam has surrendered, ACB is yet to locate the whereabouts of his brother-in-law,  , named as an accused in the DPA case and suspected to be his benami. 
 
 ACB also grilled   and Nishant Reddy, alleged benamis of Purushottam Reddy, on Friday. The court granted four days' custody of the duo to ACB sleuths. 
 
 Purushottam Reddy was earlier arrested by the ACB in 2009 in a DA case but the case was closed by the government in 2012.
