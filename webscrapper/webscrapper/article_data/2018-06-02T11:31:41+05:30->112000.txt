KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's transport minister says owners of more than 71,000 affected Honda cars will be penalized if they fail to replace flawed   in a drastic move to curb fatalities.

 
 The deaths of seven people in Malaysia have been linked to the defective airbags. The latest victim was a 23-year old student whose 2004   crashed in Kuala Lumpur on May 27, the second death this year alone.
 
 Transport Minister   said Saturday that owners of 71,315 Honda cars have still not responded to the recall replacement and will be barred from renewing their road tax if they don't do so.
 
 He says Honda sent 28 recall notices to the student's family but it didn't reach them because they didn't update their address.
