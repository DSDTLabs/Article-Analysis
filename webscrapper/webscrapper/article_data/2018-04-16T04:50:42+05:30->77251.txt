 The contract period for the new tender, which is to be floated this week, is six months, excluding  , and the cost includes maintenance for a period of seven years after the pumping station is completed.
 
 “The earlier contractor,  , was given sufficient time. We had over a dozen meetings with him persisting him to complete the work on time, but he didn’t,” said additional municipal commissioner Vijay Singhal. The contractor has been served a show-cause notice for blacklisting him from future civic works.
 
 With the pumping station only   and the new deadline set for January, it is not good news for Khar, Santacruz, Juhu and Andheri residents as they can expect to wade through another waterlogged monsoon.
 
 The BMC has also decided to recover the compensation charges for delay in deliverance of Rs 21 crore from the previous contractor’s running bill, said civic officials.
 
 “The project is half complete though three years have passed since work started,” said a civic official. “The pumps have been brought in from Korea and screens from Germany, but both are yet to be installed. The balance work includes getting the pumping station started.”
