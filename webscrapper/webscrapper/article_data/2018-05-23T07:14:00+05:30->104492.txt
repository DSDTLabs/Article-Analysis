GHAZIABAD: A political aide of   chairperson   allegedly threatened to kill the executive officer of the civic body by pointing a gun at his forehead during an argument on Tuesday. The incident occurred inside the cabin of the official K K   at the   office.

 According to police, the argument ensued after the aide,   Bhati, forcibly wanted to take home some government files pertaining to civic work in Khoda. 
 
 Yogesh Bhati is the brother of Reena Bhati’s slain husband  , a local BJP fucntionary who was gunned down by bike-borne assailants in the run-up to the municipal polls last year.
 
 “Yogesh called me on my mobile phone around noon when I was not in my office. He had reached my office with six men and wanted to take some files home. I denied them permission. He told me the files need to be perused by the chairperson but I asked him to bring her along to my office. A minor argument ensued,” Bhadana told TOI.
 
 Bhadana reached office around 2 pm accompanied by cops. “Reena Bhati had also reached my office. Yogesh Bhati picked up a bitter quarrel with me and pointed a gun at my forehead in the presence of the chairperson,” said Bhadana.
 
 Following this, Bhadana as well as Reena Bhati lodged complaints against each other at Khoda police station. Reena Bhati also alleged that the official pointed a gun at her and her aides during the argument.
 
 “Bhadana pointed a gun at me during the argument. The files pertain to financial dealings of civic work. There have been allegations of payoffs by contractors and I wanted to peruse the files but he has not been permitting me to do so,” said Reena Bhati.
 
 A large mob gathered outside the municipality office and Khoda police station after the news spread.
 
 “No FIR has been registered till now. Both parties are trying to sort out the matter after local elders of the colony intervened,” said Khoda police station in-charge O P Singh.
