NEW DELHI:   is around the corner and surely you are hoping that finance minister   will reduce income tax rates. At present, India has a minimum tax rate of 10 per cent and maximum 35.5 per cent. According to reports, the finance ministry is contemplating a hike in personal   and plans to tweak tax slabs. But if high tax rates bother you these facts should make you feel better. 

 
 
 
  
  
 One, our current tax rates are far better than peak rates of 93.5 per cent that Indians paid in 1970-71-- the highest ever.
 
 Two, in other developed nations tax rates are higher. In the US, the maximum tax rate is 39.6 per cent, the same goes for UK and China where the peak rate stands at 45 per cent. Even in South Africa, one has to pay a minimum rate of 18 per cent--way higher than what the current minimum rate in India.
 
 Lastly, as an Indian, you also have the advantage of fewer tax slabs. In 1970-71, India had 11 tax slabs which have gradually been reduced to three. The US and China have seven tax slabs each while our neighbour Pakistan has 11 tax slabs for its citizens.
