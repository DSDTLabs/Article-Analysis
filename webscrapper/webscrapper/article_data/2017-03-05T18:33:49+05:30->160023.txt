PUNE: BJP corporators belonging from Bhosari assembly constituency in   city and those from adjacent Alandi Municipal Council(AMC) took oath of national loyalty, reliability and all-inclusive development of the city. This oath was taken at the Shivai temple in Shivneri fort in presence of MLA Mahesh Landge, associate BJP MLA from Bhosari constituency on Friday.

 Shivneri fort is revered in the state as it is the birthplace of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. A total of 41 corporators from Pimpri Chinchwad city and Alandi town took the oath. Later these corprators went to see the development projects being implemented in Kusur village adopted by Landge.
 
 Vijay Phuge administered the oath to the newly elected corporators. They took the oath remembering Shivaidevi and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The oath read, “We will truly work for creating a strong nation as per the dream of Prime Minister  , for creating ‘magnetic Maharashtra’ envisioned by chief minister   and for overall development of Pimpri Chinchwad city. My political journey will be as per the priority list in which nation will be first, then the party and the post will be last. I will not fall prey to any political luring. I will not discriminate while undertaking development projects in my ward.”
 
 BJP corporators Seema Salve and   who have been elected from Bhosari assembly constituency were not present for the oath ceremony. It should be noted that Landge was a NCP corporator and the corporators owing allegiance to him are defectors from various parties. This shows that a rift exists among the BJP corporators elected from Bhosari assembly constituency.
