NEW DELHI:   cannot be treated differently and allowed to be kept in a separate prison, a special court said here on Monday, while remanding him in judicial custody till March 24. The court also rejected the defence counsel’s plea to hear his bail petition on Monday and directed that it be presented before a single judge as per the roster for Tuesday.

 Karti’s father P Chidambaram’s ministership in the home and finance departments was cited as the reason for his security threat. Senior advocates   and   argued, “He (P Chidambaram) handled several MCOCA and terror cases when he was minister of home. Several MCOCA, terror accused lodged (in Tihar jail), therefore the threat perception...” Special   judge Sunil Rana said the apprehension cannot be ignored keeping in view Karti’s social status.
 
 However, only keeping in view the fact of social status of the accused and his father, he cannot be treated differently from other accused persons and cannot be allowed to be kept in a separate room,” he held, rejecting Karti’s contention of a “great fear” that “something was going to happen” to him. The court then directed the jail superintendent and lock-up in-charge to provide   with proper safety and security as per the jail manual.
 
 Karti was produced before the court on expiry of his three-day police remand, after the CBI, in whose custody he was quizzed continuously for 12 days since his arrest on February 28 from Chennai, said he was no longer required for further custodial interrogation.
