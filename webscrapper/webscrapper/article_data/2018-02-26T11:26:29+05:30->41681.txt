CHARMINAR: The historic  , located in the heart of bustling Afzalgunj area is crying for immediate attention and restoration. 

 The  ' committee members have brought the issue to the notice of officials time and again, but no initiatives were taken to begin renovation of the masjid.
 
 Taking strong exception against the   officials' apathy, committee members said that abutment by trees, and the pathetic condition of the roofing and walls pose a serious threat to the devotees.
 
 "It is a   era's mosque built almost 300 years ago. The existing condition of structure poses a serious threat to devotees. Prior to this, some portion of the masjid has collapsed, and in the same place a big tree has grown up over time. It's roots have gone deep into the basement and all along the walls causing further damage to the mosque. The dilapidated and weak entrance of the masjid may fall anytime," said Masjid Committee President Mohammed Abdul Raheem.
 
 Committee members said they approached the   board as well, but the board failed to heed their advice.
 
 "  Chairman Mohammed Saleem appears to be active, but the oldest Masjid is being neglected unfortunately," criticized the mosque committee president.
 
  Members said while the Waqf board was collecting rent of shops, salaries of the mosque imam, mauzin, and caretakers were being taken care of by the committee.
 
 "The lack of attention toward this mosque has encouraged land grabbers. The mosque lies in dilapidated condition, and has been in that state for the last several years. Authorities should take immediate note of this and start renovation works,'' said Mohammed Khaleel, one of the devotees.
