VADODARA: Row over the forthcoming annual youth festival of M S   ( ) continued at M S University campus on Saturday as well. 

 It was on Friday that the meeting of MSUSU witnessed a spat between union’s general secretary (GS) Priyanka Patel and its vice-president (VP) Rati   over the dates on which the union’s cricket tournament and annual youth festival should be held. 
 
 Based on majority view at the meeting, MSUSU had announced that the annual youth festival will be held between February 7 and February 20. 
 
 But Mehta on Saturday claimed that she has received assurance from university authorities that the youth fest will not be held on this dates.
 
 “As per the rules, GS is supposed to call the meeting after giving 72 hours intimation. Even for calling an emergency meeting, consent of VP is required. In the case of Friday’s meeting, neither was the intimation given 72 hours in advance nor my consent was taken,” said Mehta, “hence the meeting was illegal.” 
 
 She claimed that as per rules two-third majority is necessary if any decision is to be taken. “There are many faculty representatives (FRs) who do not want the youth fest to be held on the dates that have been illegally declared,” she said, adding that their group has approached MSU vice-chancellor professor  , who is patron of the union and has final say in such matters. 
 
 Vyas, however, told TOI that he has not received any representation on the dates of the youth fest.
 
 The youth fest will be held on the theme of ‘Green university, clean university and pollution free university’. The union has planned a series of activities including tree plantation and cleanliness drives at the campus apart from the usual events like debates, antakshari, mime and skits, street plays, one act plays, movie shows, trans DJ, mimicry, concert, mono acting and fashion show.
