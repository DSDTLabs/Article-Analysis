Nagpur: Production at Reliance Aerostructure’s unit at Mihan-SEZ is planned to begin in the first quarter of 2018. Construction of the unit would start by end of the month. “The board of approvals (BOA) for SEZs, under the ministry of commerce, has recently sanctioned the company’s proposal to get a co-developer status in Mihan,” said a Reliance official.  “Reliance will be setting up the Dhirubhai Ambani Aerospace Park at Mihan. Spread in an area of 289 acres, it is dubbed to be the biggest greenfield aerospace project in the country”, he added. A co-developer can let out space to other units in the complex. The first phase of development will be spread over 104 acres and the second phase will cover an additional area of 185 acres.  At present the company has been allotted 104 acres with the rest to be taken up later. “The aerospace park will also be home to the Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited, a joint venture formed to execute the Rs30,000 crore offset program linked to the sale of 36 Rafale fighter jets to India,” said the official. The joint venture has shortlisted over 200 vendors, mostly small and mid-sized enterprises, to be part of the supply chain. “The proposed projects in the first phase include production of aircraft, electronic warfare systems, radars, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) for commercial aircraft,” said the official. Reliance will have to pay Rs38 crore to Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC), the developer of Mihan-SEZ, towards pending land cost. Only after the amount is paid, Reliance will get the final possession of 104 acres. Sources say the dues are expected to be cleared during this month. Earlier, Reliance wanted MADC to build a taxiway connecting its site to the airstrip, till then it had withheld the payment of Rs28 crore Now, the company has softened its stance, said sources.
