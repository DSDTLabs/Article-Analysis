 Ans: Strict implementation of prohibition and gambling laws. While the DGP’s office will directly monitor action on liquor traffickers, bootleggers and gambling den operators, the state monitoring cell will be given a free hand to act against such elements. We will equip the monitoring cell with adequate manpower and infrastructure to be effective.

However, if a crime results from such conflicts, we will take strict action according to the law to maintain peace in the state.
