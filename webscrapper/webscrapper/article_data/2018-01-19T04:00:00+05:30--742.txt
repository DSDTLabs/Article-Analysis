Rajkot: Kishan Mer, son of a stationery shop owner in Bagasra town of Amreli, bagged the third position in Gujarat in chartered accountancy (CA) final exam conducted by the ICAI. He is among the top 50 in the country. 

 His father Rajubhai could hardly contain his emotions. He said, “I had requested my cousin in Ahmedabad to help Kishan in further studies. I used to send him money by saving from house expenses. I can’t describe how happy I am today. After so much struggle, my son has cleared the CA final exam not only with flying colours, but is also among top three in the state.” 
 
 Kishan, who is in his early 20s, had studied throughout in Gujarati medium in Bagasra town. He graduated from a private college in Ahmedabad and passed all the CA exams in first attempt. “I used to study for 15 hours a day as I come from a small town and my goal was fixed. I was making my own notes,” he said.
