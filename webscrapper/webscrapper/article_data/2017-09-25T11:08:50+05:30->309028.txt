BATHINDA: With Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) deciding not to place any fresh orders for coal supplies for  , it appears that all is set for its closure. Besides, the existing stock of coal has almost finished.As per the   management, the units were made operational to exhaust the coal supplies. The PSPCL board of directors has already recommended the dismantling of two of the four units of the 460 MW power plant.The matter has been referred to a cabinet sub-committee headed by Punjab health minister  .

 The management is of the view that the plant has outlived its life and the power generation at this plant costs more than the other plants in the state in public and private sector. However, the power engineers association claims that the units1 and 2 could run efficiently till 2019 and the other two till 2029 after nearly Rs 700 crore were spent on their renovation and modernisation (R&M) from 2004 to 2014. Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal on Sunday said that the plant had been temporarily closed as there was not much demand for power.
 
 The PSPCL in a meeting of Board of Directors held in the first week of July had cleared the proposal to dismantle two units of 110MW each in Bathinda and 210 MW each in Ropar. The decision had been taken in the light of the   (CEA) norms of prescribing the life of any fuel-based thermal plant at 25 years. These plants, as per officials, do not fulfil the norms on the counts of age and emission and have outlived their age, said a senior PSPCL official.
 
 PSEB Engineers Association representative   said that after the R&M of the plant the four units still could generate power for some more years.
