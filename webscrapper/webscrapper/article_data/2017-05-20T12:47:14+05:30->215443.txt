KOLKATA: The construction of a   on the   on the east bank necessitates evacuation of a building on 42,  , so that strengthening and   can be done. On Friday, Justice Dipankar Datta directed to serve notice on the owner of a hotel in the building for appearance in court. 

 Majority of the occupants of the building are clueless about the impending evacuation. Metro counsel Raj Kumar Bose said, "The court has asked me to serve notice on the owner of Yatrik Hotel to appear in court on June 6."
 
 Employees of Yatrik, however, said they have not got any notice from anyone. "Where will we go, if we are evicted from here," wondered a hotel employee. Yogendra Yadav, an employee of a engineering parts shop, said the ownership of the building is disputed and there are multiple owners. 
 
 KMRC officials said the building is in very advanced stage of decay. "This is why we need to undertake extensive repairing job and reinforcement of the structure so that the vibration generated by the construction of the ventilation shaft does not affect it. There will be proper rehabilitation of the current occupants before the repairing is undertaken.
 
 KMRC has earmarked 25 vulnerable buildings along the E-W Metro corridor of which 16 are in 'poor' and 9 in 'extremely poor' shape.
