... or out of it, as neuroscientists try to discover magic tablets to ignite or quash romantic feelings.

 Hey there, going through a heartbreak? Pop a pill and get it over with! Feeling lonesome without romance? Take that love pill, fall in love, or re-fall in love (if you’ve been married for decades and the spark’s gone missing). Science may soon provide the first-ever ‘pain-free’ answer. In his research on love drugs, Brian Earp, researcher at Oxford University’s Institute for neuroethics, is trying to find magical pills to help you fall in and out of love. In his paper, he describes love as “a feeling of deep affection or fondness for someone, arising from attractive qualities...” According to this study, love is merely a chemical reaction in the human brain. And a love pill can be invented soon to trigger this chemical reaction in people.
 
 
 
 Says Mumbai-based blogger and student Surbhi Pandhya, “Yes, if it makes you fall in love. As you grow older, it gets harder to fall in love or meet the right man. This could simplify life, even with Mr Half Right!” Actor and anchor Gitika Ganju Dhar has a different view. She says a ‘love pill’ would change the dynamics and chemistry of love, which still makes the world go round. She says, “With a pill, we would be controlling the most romantic thing in our life. If we start manipulating the chemistry of love through drugs, that would make emotions quite mechanical.”
 
 
 
 However, the search for this love pill is serious business. And in a world, where finding a suitable boy/girl is becoming increasingly difficult, it may be the elixir of love. Australian philosopher and bioethicist Julian Savulescu and researcher Anders Sandberg claim in their study Neuroenhancement of Love and Marriage: The Chemicals Between Us that it’s possible to interfere with the biology of human attraction with the help of chemical ‘blockers’ for heartbreak, and ‘enhancers’ to make people favourably disposed towards love. The study also says the ‘love pill’ would have ‘modulators of love’, which could potentially help couples stay together longer, increase attractiveness and decrease infidelity. What could be better in our world of fractured relationships? But relationship expert Nisha Khanna isn’t totally convinced despite the “seemingly-positive” changes the pill can bring about. “A pill might change the attraction intensity and quotient, but you need trust and communication skills to keep the relationship going in the long run,” she says. Author Manjiri Prabhu is left aghast by the whole idea. “That would make poets turn in their grave and put an end to all romance for good. Wouldn’t popping a love pill just be too clinical? Falling in love is more than just nerves and chemistry. Emotions are neuroscience, but life is more complex than that.”
 
 The 24X7 digital world has left emotional devastation on its path, as we all can feel and see its effects all around us. Now that a love pill seems to be on its way to become a reality, what about heartbreak? That too, say scientists. In the study If I Could Just Stop Loving You: Anti-Love Biotechnology and the Ethics of a Chemical  , Earp, along with his fellow researchers, delve into modern neuroscience to come up with a range of possible interventions in case of heartache that might actually work. This one, I have a feeling, will have its takers even among the detractors, for no one forever wants to live in unbearable pain. And moving on is hard. In comes Date Dr Hitch... with his pills. Happy Sunday!

 -Falling in love is more than just nerves and chemistry. Emotions are neuroscience, but life is more complex than that.
