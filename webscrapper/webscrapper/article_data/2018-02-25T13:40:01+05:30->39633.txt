COIMBATORE: Candid laughter filled the Kikani Auditorium when 85-year-old Dr G   got on to the stage on Saturday. The audience had gathered to witness the release of ‘How to be Middle Class and Happy’ written by the octogenarian.

 It is his eight non-medical book, the doctor said. “I was born and lived in a middle class family all my life and since it was a large family, humour was the only way to survive each other,” he said.
 
 The book contains anecdotes from his life and even gives advice on how to get a good hair-cut and how to travel in auto-rickshaws to make middle class life enjoyable. “Among all classes it is the middle class that can enjoy their life. The upper class and the lower class can never enjoy life. So, this book is about the premise and advice on how to enjoy a middle class life,” Lakshmipathi said.
 
 “Middle class families often struggle to find out which class they belong to. If you go to work and find your name on the building, you are upper class. If you find your name on the nameplate on your desk, you are middle class. If you find the name on your cap or clothes, you belong to the lower class,” the doctor said, prompting loud laughter from the audience.
 
 “Seeing diseases and disability always, humour is the only escape to lead a happy life. I hope this book makes people’s lives simpler and happier,” he added.
 
 The book has the foreword from member of Parliament  . The chief guest at the function, film artist Mohan Raman, rightly put it when he said that this is the only piece of writing in which Tharoor hasn’t used any complicated words he is so famous for.
