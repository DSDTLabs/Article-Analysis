NEW DELHI: The second day of the assembly session opened on a dramatic note, with Karawal Nagar MLA   holding up a poster bearing a picture of AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP elect   holding a snake, with CM Arvind Kerjiwal’s picture photoshopped on it. When he refused to sit down, speaker   marshalled him out. BJP MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa was also marshalled out for obstructing the marshals when they were taking Mishra out. The issue was referred to the privilege committee.

 Leader of opposition Vijender Gupta was also pulled up by the speaker. Goel “condemned” Gupta’s allegations regarding marshalling out of Mishra. “It is very unfortunate that the leader of the opposition made baseless allegations that Mishra was beaten up by Delhi Police personnel when he was marshalled out of the House under my directions,” Goel observed.
 
 Later, Sirsa told reporters that he was not blocking the marshals but merely asking Mishra to leave. Earlier, Mishra alleged that   had “sold” its Rajya Sabha seats and demanded a discussion on the matter in the House.
 
 Meanwhile, Gupta issued a statement later to reinforce his views on the proceedings in the House. He “condemned the misbehavior of marshals with MLA Kapil Mishra”.
