Heritage   exponent and Padma Shri awardee Mohammad Ali Baig’s new play, 
 , is set for its Bengaluru premiere this weekend. Inspired by the major turning points in his own life, Under an Oak Tree, is an amalgamation of memories and experiences that are instrumental in shaping the person   is.

  A reminiscence of sorts, the play is “a poignant journey of childhood, adolescence and adulthood of a person who was raised in a privileged palace, grew up to immerse himself in the jet-set advertising world, came to terms with the deep loss of his father, returned to his family legacy of heritage theatre, and finally went on to receive one of India’s highest civilian honours, the Padma Shri”.
 
  Bengaluru comprises a significant chunk of this dramatic piece. “This city was a major learning ground for me. I had spent 10 formative years of my life in this city, learning the traits of the advertising world. It was a coming-of-age experience for me, leaving the cocoon of my home in Hyderabad and exploring myself as a professional in Bengaluru.” The play is presented by Qadir Ali Baig Theatre Foundation.
 
  Written by  , the play promises a host of interesting aspects that includes a contemporary-yet-heritage-toned set design and Middle Eastern style background score. The hour-long play formed part of the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival in Mumbai, while it also had a UK premiere in London.
 
  “It’s crafted in the storytelling format, with the narrative being highly gripping and imaginative. Costume and décor have been given equal focus in the play, with the essence of heritage theatre being maintained throughout the modern-day story,” sums up Ali Baig, who has also designed and directed the play.
