MADURAI: Belgian photographer  , who conducted a workshop on street photography in   on Tuesday, had a word of advice for the participants: Capturing the spirit of an event is more important than cheap sensationalism of gore and violence. Citing  , he said, “Jallikattu has to be photographed with cultural and traditional background in mind. Photojournalists clicking pictures of gore to create sensation only invites negative reaction towards the ‘magnificent sport’.” The Belgian national has documented the city extensively, bringing out daily life through breathtaking photographs.

 He conducted a workshop on street photography for young professionals on Tuesday. He shared his photographs taken around Madurai during the workshop. “If you want to shoot people, make them happy first. Photography is about talking to people and Tamil people in my experience are the best to pose for pictures”, he said.
 
 While people are often the subject, Henk also places tradition and culture in the background, making the picture lively. “The real challenge is showing the tiny things of life in the most beautiful way, which most of the professionals often forget,” he said.
 
 A retired prison superintendent, Henk’s connection to   dates back to 1987 while he was doing a thesis on the history of Indian architecture. He started coming to Tamil Nadu often and spent three months in a year here, learning the language and touring the state.
 
 Henk, in fact, uses a nickname, Oochappan, a name of an acquaintance in Madurai and adds that Mangulam, a village on the outskirts, is his favourite spot.
 
 “Madurai is a place where one can have a glimpse of the entire Tamil culture. It has every element of the state and one does not have to travel across the state,” he said.
