The Madras high court’s direction on Tuesday to remove a temple ‘constructed’ on Public Works Department land on   has brought the focus on several similar encroachments on public space. While some are right on roads, others have encroached upon pavements, narrowing the space for pedestrians.

 Of the temples TOI visited on Wednesday, one has grabbed a portion of the pavement on Medavakkam Main Road in  , while another has taken over a portion of   that is under the purview of metro rail, with an illegal structure extended till the pillars (of metro rail) even as a makeshift fence has been erected to expand it further. At Ashok Nagar, one temple stands in the middle of an intersection with 11th Avenue, while a temple on Pillayar Koil Street in West Mambalam has almost taken over the lane.
 
 Such encroachments are not new said T Nagar Residents Welfare Association secretary B Kannan. “Most of these illegal structures have political backing. That’s why government machinery is refusing to act,” he said.   said he had approached a court against an illegal place of worship on   in T Nagar which also ate up the pavement. “Despite the court’s direction, action is yet to be taken,” he added.
 
  
 
 
 Chitlapakkam Residents Associations Coordination Committee convenor P Vishwanathan said those keen on building places of worship must do so by purchasing land. “A few months ago, the (Kancheepuram) district administration and revenue department removed three temples on the bund of Chitlapakkam lake,” he added.
