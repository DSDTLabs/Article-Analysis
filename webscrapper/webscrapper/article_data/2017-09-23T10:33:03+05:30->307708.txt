VISAKHAPATNAM: AU Students' Welfare Association president   met Vizag North   P   and requested him to exert pressure on the government to make Government Order (GO) No. 40 applicable for them. 

 Rao said GO 40 promises a monthly scholarship of 1,050 and rice at subsidised prices for the hostel mess. "We at Andhra University are only getting 682 for BC students and 820 for SC/ST students as scholarship as opposed to 1,050 for students at welfare hostels. The amount we get is barely enough to meet even one-third of our mess expenses at the varsity. We have requested MLA Vishnu Kumar Raju to implement the GO," said Rao. Raju said he will raise the issue with the relevant authorities.
