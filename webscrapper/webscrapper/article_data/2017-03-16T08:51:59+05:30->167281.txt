PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The Maharashtra State   Limited (MSEDCL) has disconnected power supply to 16,202   in 10 days as a part of its drive against consumers not paying bills despite repeated appeals.

 A statement issued by MSEDCL said the company was in a difficult financial situation and so it was undertaking the drive to recover arrears. It has started disconnecting power supply of defaulters in the   zone, irrespective of the amount defaulted by domestic, commercial and industrial consumers.
 
 A consumer whose supply has been disconnected has to pay the bill, show the receipt of payment and pay reconnection charges for the power supply resumption.
 
 Directives have also been issued to lodge criminal complaints against the defaulters using power illegally.
 
 Consumers can pay their dues at authorized bill payment centres or online at www.mahadiscom.in or on MSEDCLâ€™s mobile app.
