We don't see any major change in the weather at the moment,“ said  , director, RMC. “Now that February is he re, the chances of the temperature falling below the normal mark seems remote. The north-westerly winds will steadily weaken. Coupled with temperature rise in northwest India, the mercury will head north,“ added Das.
 
 Kolkata recorded a lowest of the 11.2 degrees Celsius this season. Two successive western disturbances, however, intervened with the flow of north-westerly winds and pushed the mercury up.
