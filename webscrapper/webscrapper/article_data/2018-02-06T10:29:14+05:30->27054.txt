BENGALURU: With the current bench strength of 24 sitting judges out of a sanctioned 62 (a 61% vacancy rate, the highest in the country), and a backlog of 2.7 lakh cases (as of 2016), the Karnataka high court is the most stressed in the country.

 At full strength, each judge would have to handle a backlog of 4,478 cases, a workload that’s well above the national average of 3,299 cases per judge. However, this would put Karnataka behind the high courts of Andhra Pradesh/Telengana, Rajasthan,  , Allahabad and workload leader Odisha.
 
 But with the current state of the bench, Karnataka high court is the worst off in India. Each of   would have to handle at the very least, a mind-boggling 11,568 backlog of cases, assuming that the numbers have not changed since 2016. As this is unlikely, given the  , each judge’s workload is likely to be much higher.
 
 
  
  
 
 There were 2.5 lakh   and 24,007   with the Karnataka high court at the end of 2016. The situation became so stressful that judges stopped looking at new cases in 2017, focusing on trying to clear some of the backlog. And given that a case can drag on for anything between 8 and 10 years, petitioners may not see resolution in their lifetimes.
 
 If you want to litigate, the best place would probably be Sikkim. The threejudge bench is full, and the backlog per judge as per 2016 is only 57.
