Just when everyone thought that
 and 
 's mid-air spat was water under the bridge for the two of them, a new development has taken place due to which they have locked horns once again.

 It all started when Sunil said that he had not been approached by Kapil for his new show,  . When the latter had announced his show, many had questioned Sunil if he will be part of the same when it goes on air. In regard to this, Sunil Grover poured out in a tweet of his which incurred Kapil's wrath.
 
 Sunil in response to a tweet expressed, “Bhai aap jaise kuch aur log bhi mujhse same poochte hain. Lekin mujhe iss show ke liye KOI call nahin aaya. Mera phone number bhi same hai. Intezar kar Ke ab maine kuch aur sign kar liya kal. Aap logon ki duaon se ek achhe project Ke sath juda hoon. Jaldi aapke samne Aata hoon.
 
  
  
 
 This led to a barrage of tweets from Kapil's side, who, in reply to this tweet, accused Sunil of lying
 
 Kapil tweeted: Paji I called u more than 100 times n came to your house to meet u twice .. every time u were out for some show and all .. pls don’t spread rumors that I didn’t call u.
 
 He further stated in another tweet: He is lying .. I called him 100 times and sent my people to his home .. even I went to his home to meet him for the show .. but now I will not let anybody take any advantage on my name .. enough is enough.
 
 When one of his fans replied that he is one man army, Kapil replied: Don't want his support .. but at least he should not spread rumors.. m tired of all this.
