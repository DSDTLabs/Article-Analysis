LUCKNOW: Admitted in   of  , the   on Wednesday is still not out of danger. He will be under   for the next 48 hours to ascertain if he has any  .

 The young boy has suffered two gashes from a sharp subject—one in his chest and the other in the abdomen, which is a deep one. There are injuries on his face also.
 
 “The deep wound in his abdomen had penetrated through his muscle into the peritoneal cavity, which is a fine cover over the intestines. It is a 1-1.5-inch wound by width and its depth is yet to be known,” said head of trauma surgery department Prof Sandeep Tiwari.
 
 He added that while the boy was under observation, there was no need for a surgery yet. If there is any internal
 
 injury, it will manifest itself within 72 hours, he added.
 
 “The CT scan has not shown the depth of the wound. That will be clear in the next few hours. Gashes are from a sharp object but only a forensic expert can tell what object it actually was,” he added.
