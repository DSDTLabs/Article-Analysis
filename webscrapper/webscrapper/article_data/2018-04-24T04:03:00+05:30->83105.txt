Vadodara: A city-based software company submitted an application to police commissioner’s office on Monday to lodge a complaint against its former business development executive Neel Desai for cheating. But when the case was not registered, the company – Spaculus Software Private Ltd – approached the court that ordered the police to register the case.

 Desai is accused of breaching the employment non-disclosure agreement signed after joining the company in April 2016. 
 
 He used to carry out his own business as a competitor of the company. He also used the company’s software codes, portfolios, software database and client details for his own business. Desai also took help from company’s competitors, it is alleged.
 
 Cops said that Desai admitted to the fraud in July 2017 and gave details about the cheating on a stamp paper.
