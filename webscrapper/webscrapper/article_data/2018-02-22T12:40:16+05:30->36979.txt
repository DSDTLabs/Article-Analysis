 The petitioners said 'Manikya Malaraya Poovi', a Muslim folk song of Malabar region of Kerala, was written in 1978 by PMA Jabbar in praise of the love between   and his first wife Khadeeja. "What is hard to fathom is that a song which has been in existence for the past 40 years, which was written, sung and cherished by the Muslim community in Kerala, is now being termed as an insult to the Prophet and his wife."
 
 "The film 'Oru Adaar Love' is yet to be completed and Rs 1.5 crore has been spent on it. Such flimsy and baseless complaints and FIRs cause nothing but hindrance in the freedom of speech and expression," the petitioners said.
