 It is a tradition in Surti households to eat Undhiya, a delicacy made of a number of vegetables, on the day of Uttarayan. “We love to have Undhiya with puri, jalebi and mathha. I would buy papdi and brinjal and sweet potato to make the delicacy for family and friends,” said  , a housewife from Nanpura.
