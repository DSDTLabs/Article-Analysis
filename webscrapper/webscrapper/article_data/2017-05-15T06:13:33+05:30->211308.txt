BENGALURU: Several parts of the city were lashed by heavy rain and   – the Karnataka State Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) recording winds raging at 18 to 20kmph at Begur and Lalbagh around 4pm.

 Very high rainfall in localities of southeast Bengaluru such as   (68mm) and Mahadevapura (62mm) disrupted normal life. One of the arterial roads in Koramangala, 80 feet Road was cut off for approximately two-and-a-half hours, blocked by a tree that brought down an electric pole along with it. Power outage in the area only added to the residents’ woes.
 
 K Nagaraj, a resident of Koramangala 6th Block, said, “It’s an unfortunate day. Bescom, and personnel from other corporations are working in different areas. The trouble is that we are not receiving any response on the Bescom helpline (1912). The residents were forced to contact executive engineers and other officials working at the spot. The process would have been far smoother if the helpline was functioning.”
 
 Nagaraj said that the areas near the Subramanya temple and Club Road had been affected badly.
 
 Another resident Girish Vasudev attributed the mess on 80 Feet Road to work undertaken by various utilities. “80 feet road, and other streets in the area have been dug up. As a result, the roots of the trees have become weak. A number of cars have been getting stuck in the mud too,” he said. 
 
 
 
 
 The average wind speed recorded in the city on Sunday was 12 to 15kmph, according to KSNDMC. Warning the citizens to guard against instances of crashing trees, the body forecast scattered rainfall in Bengaluru, south and coastal Karnataka over the next three days. 
 
 SSM Gavaskar, a scientist with KSNDMC, said that the rain was a result of an active pre-monsoon. “Overcast skies, scattered rain can be expected over the next two weeks,” he added.
