 On Wednesday night, the Dow Jones Index in the US had dropped 370 points, or 1.8% — it’s steepest fall in about six months — amid uncertainty over Trump’s political future. The slide came on the back of reports that Trump, as US President, had tried to influence an investigation relating to alleged Russian interference in his election. Additionally, what is also being investigated is his close aides’ unauthorised contacts with Russian officials. As a result, the sensex started on a weak note, after rallying to new record peaks in four of the five previous sessions, and at one point was down more than 250 points. Of the 30 sensex stocks, 24 ended in the red, five closed with gains, while one stock was unchanged. 
 
 Dealers say that investors feel that the current political storm could keep Trump away from his agenda of slowing down the flow of Indian IT workers working in the US, the largest IT services export market for Indian companies. This, in turn, could help Indian IT companies maintain higher margins.
