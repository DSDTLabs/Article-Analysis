For the Congress, which appears to be an underdog in the current scenario, the much-needed solace came from Jharsuguda district where of the six ZP seats that went to polls in the first two phases, the party has since bagged five. With voting for three more seats pending in the next phases, local Congress MLA Nabakishore Das said his party would comfortably form the council. 

 The second phase polling debunked for sure the myth that the   is only confined to certain western Odisha pockets and the coastal region is invincible for it. In Kendrapada district, of the 14 ZP seats where elections were held, eight have since gone to the BJP, breaking the monopoly of the BJD in particularly Patkura and   constituencies. The ruling party has so far got six seats. The district has 32 ZP seats.
 
 So has been the situation in   district where of the 22 seats the BJP has so far got 10. The district has 46 ZP seats, of which 12 and 10 went to polls in the first and second phases, respectively.
 
 Given the trend available thus far, the BJP looks sure to form the ZP council in at least three districts - Kalahandi, Balangir and Mayurbhanj. 
 
 Kalahandi district has 36 seats. The BJP in the last two phases has bagged 18. In Balangir district, the saffron brigade has so far won 11 of the 13 seats that went to polls. Elections to the remaining 21 seats would be held in the next three rounds. Similarly in Mayurbhanj district, once considered a JMM stronghold, trends show the BJP is doing quite well having won 22 out of a total 56 seats.
