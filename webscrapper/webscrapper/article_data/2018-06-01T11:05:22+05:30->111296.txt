CHANDIGARH: A fire broke out in bushes in an open area in Industrial Area   on Friday. It took half-an-hour for the fire department to douse the flames. 

 Two fire tenders were pressed into service.
 
 Though no damage was reported, some parked cars in the adjacent parking lot could have been damaged if the fire wasn't controlled on time. People who noticed the fire informed owners of two cars, who removed their vehicles from the spot. But owner of another car could not be traced. But, before flames could spread further, fire tenders controlled the fire.
 
 Though the exact reason of the fire could not be known, fire officials suspected that it might be task of someone who either might be smoking or had thrown some flammable material at the site.
 
 Since the fire station was situated in Industrial Area Phase-I, fire tenders reached the spot within five minutes after getting the information.
