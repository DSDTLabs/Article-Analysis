NAGPUR: A   conspired with her boyfriend (18) in a bid to eliminate her parents at her place in   in Nandanvan on Saturday night. The girl, who regarded her parents as being a hurdle in her relationship, laced her parents’ dinner with rat poison which her boyfriend   gave her. When the poison failed to kill the victims, the girl even let him in her house to stab them. 

 Bhilkar, who dropped out of school after he couldn’t clear Std X, and the minor girl, studying in Std XII, were in a relationship since three years and stayed in the same locality. But girl’s father wanted her to concentrate on her studies. “Bhilkar was slapped with kidnapping charges by Kotwali police earlier as the duo had run away but were later nabbed,” said PSI  . Bhilkar was released from the remand home a few days back, she added.
 
 Sources said that the girl mixed poison in the food that her parents and two younger brothers had. But when she saw that the poison did not work, she called up Bhilkar. Her family was in deep slumber when the girl opened the main door and let Bhilkar inside. Bhilkar attacked the girl’s father, a school van driver, with a sharp weapon and throttled him too. As his wife rushed to save him, the duo attacked her too. Hearing the shouts, the minor’s uncle went upstairs but until then, Bhilkar fled from the spot.
 
 Nandanvan police reached the spot after being informed. The victims were shifted to a private hospital. Bhilkar was rounded up from the area within a few hours. On Sunday, police recovered the wrapper of the rat poison from his place. The police rounded up the girl for questioning. During questioning, she told them, “Bhilkar had promised me a good life. As my parents were against our relationship, Bhilkar told me to kill them and he too would help me.”
 
 An offence of attempt to murder has registered against Bhilkar and the minor. The family is recuperating in the hospital. Further probe is underway.
