VADODARA: Professor Umesh Dangarwala got elected as president of the   ( ) on Saturday. 

 It was after a gap of ten years that election for the post of BUTA president was held with Dangarwala and Janak Shah – both from M S University’s Faculty of Commerce - in the poll fray. 
 
 A total of 209 teachers out of 300 registered voters exercised their voting right on Saturday. Dangarwala defeated Shah by a margin of 70 votes as he bagged 139 votes while Shah bagged only 69 votes. One vote was declared invalid during counting. 
 
 While Shah was seen as a candidate supported by   vice-chancellor Parimal Vyas, Dangarwala is already at loggerheads with the university’s top brass after the former took the controversial decision of barring the latter from holding any executive post at the varsity for a period of next five years. 
 
 “We don’t believe in conflict but the university administration should follow the rule book and ensure that there is no injustice done,” said Dangarwala after getting elected as president. 
 
 The last election for the BUTA president was held in 2007 at the campus when Dr I I Pandya had defeated Shah by a margin of 300 votes. 
 
 Shah has been defeated four times in the past including that in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2007. After 2007, Pandya had won all the elections uncontested. In 2015, when Pandya chose not to jump in the poll fray, Sanjiv Vaid was elected uncontested as president for the period between 2015 and 2017. 
 
 BUTA’s new body for the term between 2017 and 2019 now has Dangarwala as president, Dr K V R Murthy from Faculty of Technology and Engineering as vice-president, Nikul Patel from Faculty of Technology and Engineering as general secretary, Dharmendra Shah from Faculty of Science as secretary (administration) and   as secretary (organisation).
