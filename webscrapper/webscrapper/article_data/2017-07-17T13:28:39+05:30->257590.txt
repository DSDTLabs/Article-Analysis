PATNA: The crisis in the ruling Bihar coalition persisted on Sunday with JD(U) leader and CM   unrelenting over RJD coming clean on corruption charges against Lalu Prasad and his kin even as the stand-off prolonged into yet another week.

 According to JD(U) sources, some sections of the party are not keen on forcing the issue. Also, the CM is seen to be weighing options as Lalu has categorically said deputy CM   will not resign on the FIR lodged by the   in a land-for-railway hotels deal during the RJD chief’s tenure as rail minister.
 
 Well-placed JD(U) sources close to the CM, however, said there was no division of opinion in the party over the need for RJD to deliver a point by point response to the case against its ruling clan as the claim of political vendetta would not wash in the public eye. The CM is understood to have made it clear that he will not budge on the issue. The crisis was dragging on as the JD(U) would have to give its partner some time to respond and Monday is the presidential election.   has already offered support and Nitish is well aware of this.
 
 JD(U) and BJP sources, who have worked with Nitish for over a decade, said the CM would certainly remove Tejashwi if he did not resign, but he is only buying time till his plan is through. They also said no one in JD(U) could question Nitish, who had removed Jitan Ram Manjhi from the CM’s post in 2015 after the latter revolted against him. At that time, five JD(U) MLAs had left the party with Manjhi.
 
 Some JD(U) sources spoke of concern over desertions but others said no one would go across to a sinking ship if Kumar remained the CM.
 
 There is speculation of likely seat-sharing between JD(U) and BJP but that stage may be in the future. JD(U) is clear that while it has not formally demanded Tejashwi’s resignation, the RJD has ruled it out. Also, the party is sceptical about   playing mediator as it has already backed the RJD’s claim of political vendetta.
