PATNA: A   team on Tuesday quizzed former chief minister   at her residence in the city in connection with the alleged land-for-railway hotel scam.

 Sources said CBI officials reached Rabri’s residence around 10.30am and returned around 2.30pm. This was for the second time that the CBI team visited Rabri’s residence in connection with the scam.
 
 “Only   was quizzed in connection with the FIR lodged by the CBI last year,” Delhi-based CBI spokesperson R K Gaur told TOI over the phone.
 
 The alleged scam dates back to the year 2005-06 when RJD chief and Rabri’s husband Lalu Prasad was the railway minister in the Congress-led UPA government. According to the FIR, the railways gave contract to a   Private Limited for running two IRCTC hotels in lieu of which Lalu family was given land worth crores in Patna.
 
 A Rs 800-crore mall was coming up on the land. Its construction was, however, stopped by the Centre and the plot attached by the ED in December last year after the alleged scam surfaced.
 
 It was after the CBI FIR that CM Nitish Kumar-led JD (U) parted ways with the RJD that led to the fall of Grand Alliance government in the state. Nitish subsequently formed a new government in alliance with the BJP in July last year.
 
 The CBI had conducted raids at 12 places, including Patna, Gurugram, Ranchi and Puri in connection with the alleged scam last year. Besides Lalu, Rabri and their son and former deputy CM Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav, IRCTC’s former MD P K Goel and Sujata Hotels’ directors   and Vinay Kochar have been named as accused in the FIR.
