NEW DELHI: The increased   fares, which came into effect from Wednesday, have gotten a number of students agitating. Students Federation of India has threatened to start a “movement” if subsidised tickets for students are not introduced in the form of passes, or the Metro fares reduced.

 Meanwhile, those travelling by the mass transit on Wednesday were not happy as they had to shell out substantially more with the new fares. The average distance travelled by commuters on the   is 15km, which falls in the high fare bracket.
 
 Divided into six fare slabs, the new fare structure, Monday through Saturday, ranges from Rs 10 to Rs 50, with travel beyond 12km costing Rs 30 and above. Those using a smart card or travelling during off-peak hours were better off, availing a discount of 10-20 percent.
 
 “While on one hand, the central government is ready to give lakhs of crores of tax concessions to big businesses of the country, it is not ready to make adequate investments in public transport system,” said SFI member Sunand Singh. Protesting against the  , SFI demanded a reversion of the hike, and making the report by the   public. 
 
 “We also want that the government initiate a concrete study to materialise the possibilities of concessional passes for students,” said the SFI member.
