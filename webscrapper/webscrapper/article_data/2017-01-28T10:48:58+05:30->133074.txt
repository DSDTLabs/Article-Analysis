PANAJI: In the last phase of Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) poll campaign in state, Prime Minister   will address a public rally at Campal in Panaji on Saturday.

 All eyes are now set on this meeting, which party feels would be attended by a crowd of 50,000, as Modi may elucidate on the statement of BJP national president,   that the next government in Goa will function under the defence minister,  .
 
 Speaking to reporters, South Goa member of parliament Narendra Sawaikar said that as part of the election campaign, Modi will address the public meeting on Saturday. It will commence at around 3.30pm, instead of 4.30pm owing to security reasons.
 
 “The prime minister has a distinct relation with Goa and affection for the state too, which had reflected in his speeches in the past,” Sawaikar said.
 
 “We have trust in Modi that through his address, he will deliver an important message to the people bringing cheer to them,” he added.
 
 He also appealed to the people to attend Modi’s rally in large numbers. The meetingwill be attended by defence minister Manohar Parrikar, chief minister, Laxmikant Parsekar, BJP Goa election incharge and Union minister Nitin Gadkari, Union AYUSH minister Shripad Naik, deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza, BJP state president Vinay Tendulkar and others.
 
 Sawaikar said that the party manifesto would be released on January 29 at the hands of Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.
 
 Reacting to the Congress manifesto, Sawaikar said that it has been prepared without giving serious thought to what people want. He said he has no doubt that the BJP will come back to power with absolute majority.
