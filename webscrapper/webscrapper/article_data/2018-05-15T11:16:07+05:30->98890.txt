CHENNAI: The Madras high court has made it clear that applicants cannot claim collateral free education loans as a matter of right for amounts greater than Rs 4 lakh.

 
 Justice S   made the observation while disposing of a plea moved by R Sanskrit, a first year MBBS student of Shri Sathya Sai Medical College and Research Institute, Tiruporur, seeking a direction to Indian Bank’s   branch to sanction an education loan of ?63.90 lakh towards tuition fees for her medical course.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing,   authorities filed an affidavit submitting that as per the guidelines issued by the government, they can provide education loan only up to ?4 lakh without any security. For loans above the prescribed limit, collateral security is a must, they said.
 
 The judge said, “As it is stated that the petitioner is hailing from a poor family and that the application is pending with Indian Bank, the college may permit the student to attend the classes for the first year by taking a necessary undertaking with regard to payment of balance fees and the same shall be paid on receipt of loan from the bank.”
 
 ‘Petitioner can’t sit for exam if fees not paid’
 
 The judge added, “If the petitioner is unable to get the entire amount as loan, she may have to pay the balance amount from her personal funds.”
 
 The loan application may be processed by the bank with respect to each academic year as per the guidelines fixed and the eligible amount may be sanctioned to the petitioner to enable her to pay the fees, the judge added.
 
 The court made it clear that if the fees are not paid, the petitioner will not be permitted to sit for the examination.
