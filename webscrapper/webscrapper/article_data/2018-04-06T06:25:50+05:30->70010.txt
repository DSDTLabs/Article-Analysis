 (TBM) Rachna had touched the diaphragm wall (concrete panels built around the underground stations to integrate them with the tunnels) on Wednesday and drilled halfway through it. The punching was over around 1pm on Thursday. The end of Rachna’s journey signals completion of the first phase of tunneling of the Metro corridor that aims to link Howrah Maidan with Sector V.
 
 TBM Prerna, which had done a ditto on March 22, is currently being dismantled. In another three days, Rachna, too, will be dismantled. The main part of the two TBMs will, however, remain underground, till the retrieval shaft is built by another contractor, ITD-Cementation by September 2019.
 
 Officials and engineers of construction agency Afcons and implementing agency   ( ) waited eagerly for the tunneling team to emerge out of the Howrah Maidan underground station. Around 1.30pm, the team, clad in orange fluorescent jackets, came out. Above the surface, Virendra Kaul, general manager, Afcons, Satya Narayan Kunwar, deputy project manager, and others greeted them.
 
 The engineers looked relaxed, knowing that Rachna has safely broken through the western diaphragm wall, 28m under the surface. Rachna is building the Kolkata-bound or the west-bound tunnel for the 16.55km corridor.
 
 The new TBMs are expected to begin journey next month after punching the eastern diaphragm wall at the Esplanade station site.
