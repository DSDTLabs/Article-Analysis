SURAT: A 17-year-old girl, who was a student of the five-year integrated BCom LLB degree course at Veer   (VNSGU), ended life at her residence in   on Sunday. 

 Urvi   hanged herself from a ceiling fan using a dupatta. Family members said she was depressed after being disqualified from appearing in the final examination of the course starting from Monday.
 
 Parate was among 150 students of the department of law at the university who had been disqualified from appearing in the final examination either due to insufficient attendance or for having failed in the internal test.
 
 Many students were upset since the notice was put up recently at the department without them being informed in advance, some claimed. The students made a representation to university authorities after which those having insufficient attendance were allowed to appear in the final examination but those who had failed in the internal test were not. Parate had insufficient attendance and also failed in the internal test, university sources said. 
 
 “The incident has been brought to my knowledge and is being looked into by the department of law. I am collecting details to find out what exactly had happened. The university will extend all possible help to the students,” vice-chancellor   said. 
 
 Meanwhile, postmortem examination of Parate’s body confirmed that she had died due to hanging. Police have registered a case of accidental death and begun investigation.
