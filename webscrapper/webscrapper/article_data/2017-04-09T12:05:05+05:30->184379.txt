Visakhapatnam: Despite the central government banning the sale of BS-III compliant vehicles from March 31, the   ( ) has said some dealers are still selling these bikes by offering huge discounts and issued cautionary notices to them.

 According to sources, dealers are offering customers in the rural and plain areas free vehicle insurance, free helmet and other discounts on the total value of the vehicle.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Visakhapatnam district RTA deputy transport commissioner S   said if any dealer cheats customers by selling BS-III vehicles after April 1, the department has the right to take action.
 
 “We are keeping an eye on every dealer in and around the city and advising the people not to fall for the discounts. We register nearly 500 new vehicles in the district monthly, but the number has came down after the new rules have been imposed. All our RTA staff have been directed to ensure that the rules are implemented successfully,” Venkateswara Rao added.
 
 Rao further said the BS-III vehicles will run on BS-IV compliant fuel and the RTA will not restrict the sale on second-hand vehicles.
 
 “I request buyers to be alert so that dealers are not able to sale their old two-wheelers. In such a case, the buyer will not be able to ride the vehicle as we will not register them,” Venkateswara Rao said.
 
 Another senior RTA official said the country will move from BS-IV to BS-VI emission norms by 2020. “Purchasing BS-III vehicles will hurt the resale value of the vehicle,” the officer said, adding that the automotive industry have incurred a loss of more than Rs 12,000 crore by keeping nearly 9 lakh BS-III complaint vehicles unsold before the deadline.
