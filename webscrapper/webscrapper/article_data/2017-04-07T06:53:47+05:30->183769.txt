HUBBAALLI:  , resident of   here, has got a reply from external affairs minister   for his   seeking her intervention to bring his wife Silvia Noreen from Pakistan. 

  For the past nine months, Daniel has been running from pillar to post to get a sponsorship certificate signed by any Indian gazzetted officer to bring back his wife. 
 
 Daniel, an employee of a mobile company, married Noreen, his distant relative and whose family lives in Pakistan, on June 25 last year. The wedding was held at United Pentecoastal Church at Youhana Colony in Lahore (Pakistan) in the presence of relatives. The wedding was registered, and the couple got a certificate by the Pakistan government.
 
 But when his repeated requests to officers and elected representatives seeking to bring back Noreen did not yield results, he tweeted to the minister to intervene and unite the couple.
 
 "I got a reply from the minister to my tweet. Earlier, I had met many officials and elected representatives concerned and spoke to them about my concerns. They did not heed my request even when I produced valid documents, including my marriage certificate. The sponsorship certificate signed by any gazetted officer -- the tahsildar, the AC, the DC -- will help my wife apply for Indian visa in Pakistan," said Daniel, hoping that the minister's replay will bail him out.
 
 In her tweet, Swaraj has that she will "examine the issue". 
 
  "I hope the minister will take up my case seriously and clear the hurdles coming in our way," he said, adding that he will wait for a fortnight to see the issue sorted out. "Else, I will personally meet the minister with help from local MPs".
