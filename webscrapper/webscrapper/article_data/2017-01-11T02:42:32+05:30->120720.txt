NEW DELHI: Consumer affairs ministry reiterated that   cannot force their clients to pay “service charge” during a meeting with representatives from the industry associations on Tuesday. It also asked the industry to address the concern of consumers “with transparency” whether the   is actually passed on to the employees.

 Sources said that the industry had approached the ministry for meeting after a public statement was issued by the government clarifying that service charge is “voluntary” and paying it or not is the discretion of consumer. It had also said incorporating it in the food bill without not prior consent of consumers is a unfair trade practice. The industry has assured that it would work out a proposal and put it before Centre, keeping in mind the best interest of consumers.
