LUDHIANA: Ludhiana boy Vasu Aggarwal has secured All India Rank 12 in Common Law Admission Test ( ), the result of which was declared on Thursday. He has scored 144.25 marks out of 199, securing a seat in National Law School for India University, Bangalore. 

 In Class XII, the 18-year-old non-medical student had scored 91.6%. 
 
 “My hard work, consistency and never-say-die spirit made this possible. I studied dedicatedly the entire year to score good marks in Class XII as well as CLAT,” said an ecstatic Vasu. 
 
 Sharing some success tips, he said, “Leave no stone unturned to achieve your goal. To motivate myself, I have pasted inspirational posters on my room wall. Mock tests help a lot. I took about 40 mock tests which helped me complete   in time and with accuracy. There are 200 objective questions for which 120 minutes are given. Students should attempt easy questions first and the tougher ones later. Since there is negative marking, one should be sure about answers.” 
 
 Besides reading books and newspapers, he studied online notes, too, to crack the exam. 
 
 “The syllabi of CLAT and Class XII are completely different, so I had to put in extra efforts. There were no fixed study hours. I gave maximum time and attention to both,” Vasu, a resident of Pakhowal Road, added. 
 
 Looking forward to take admission in National Law School of India University, Bangalore, Vasu aspires to be a corporate lawyer and work with top corporate companies.
