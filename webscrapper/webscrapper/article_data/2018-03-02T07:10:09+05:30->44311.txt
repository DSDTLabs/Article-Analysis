HYDERABAD: Attempting to play down the increasing confrontation between the BJP and TRS, which was reflected in chief minister  's criticism of Prime Minister   and the right-wing party taking umbrage to that, Union defence minister Nirmala   said on Thursday that she has been informed by industries minister   that his father's remarks against the PM was a 'slip of tongue'. 

 Sitaraman told the media here on Thursday evening that it was only after getting the clarification from KTR from Delhi that she decided to take part in the inauguration of the Apache helicopter unit at Tata Boeing Aerospace Ltd in the city.
 
 Last week,   had 'criticised' Modi on issues related to farmers. In response, state BJP leaders had burnt the CM's effigy and complained to governor ESL Narasimhan about the personal attack on the Prime Minister by the chief minister.
 
 "KTR told me that it could be 'slip of the tongue' and that he believes that his father would not have intentionally opted to use such words," she told the media. According to her, KTR told her this when she telephoned him from Delhi and checked with him whether to participate in the Tata-Boeing programme or not in the wake of his father KCR's remarks against the PM.
 
 She said that before boarding the flight in the morning, and while sharing the dais at the function, she had raised the issue and told KTR that it was not proper on the part of a chief minister, who is holding a constitutional post at the state, to abuse the PM, who is also in a constitutional post. KTR could not be reached for his comments on the matter.
