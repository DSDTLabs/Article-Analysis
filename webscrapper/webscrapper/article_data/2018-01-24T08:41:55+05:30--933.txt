NEW DELHI: He had “died” over a  , and the   in which his alleged death occurred was considered  . But he had done this stunt just to get cops off his heels so that he could   with ease.

 However, Tajender Sood’s run ended after police laid a trap and caught him red-handed while committing a crime. This 59-year-old man has now been charged with many heinous crimes committed in his “afterlife”. The cases range from attempt to murder, robberies and severely hurting victims.
 
 Sood was declared dead by a court when he was 48 years old. He kept changing his attire and wore wigs to avoid getting recognised. His “haunted house” remained vacant and he would sneak in there at night. If anyone saw him, they would mistake him for a ghost.
 
 A police source said that his family knew about his plan and would meet him at his hideouts. He would change his location every few weeks and never spoke to or made friends with anyone in the placed he lived at.
 
 During the ongoing checking for Republic Day, a special team led by SHO (Kirti Nagar) Anil Sharma caught hold of four proclaimed offenders on the same day, one of whom was Sood. He had been living in Jahangirpuri with his wife and two daughters.
 
 Sood told police that as he had many criminal cases lodged against him, he contacted other criminals on the internet who suggested that he should get himself declared dead. He then roped in his wife and daughters for this task and after some time a court declared him dead.
 
 The criminal didn’t use a mobile phone to avoid getting tracked. He was paid a hefty amount for each contract to injure people. He had learnt from action movies about how to thrash people and not kill them. Police are trying to find out how many cases have been committed by him till date.
