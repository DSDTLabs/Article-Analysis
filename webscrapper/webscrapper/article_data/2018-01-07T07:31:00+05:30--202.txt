CHANDIGARH:   has become the first state in the country to launch high risk pregnancy (HRP) portal. This portal not only helps in early identification of high-risk pregnancy cases up to the grass-roots level but also ensures their timely referral to the civil hospitals for further management and delivery by specialists.

 Haryana health minister Anil   said on Saturday that the initiative had been lauded by the Niti Ayog and the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The High Risk Pregnancy Policy has been implemented across the state since November 2017, for identifying 100% name-based high-risk pregnancy cases and ensuring their delivery by specialists at civil hospitals.
 
 “This initiative will definitely increase the pace of decline in maternal mortality rate ( ), infant mortality rate (IMR) and still birth incidence as morbidity and mortality is quite high in high risk pregnant cases, if not managed timely,” Vij said.
 
 Principal secretary of health department   said, “This innovative web application has been designed to track every high risk pregnant woman till 42 days after delivery, so that she receives adequate treatment during the ante-natal period for healthy outcome of pregnancy.”
 
 National Health Mission mission director   said instructions had been issued to all civil surgeons for 100% entry of high risk pregnant cases in the HRP Portal and their management at civil hospitals by specialists.
 
 The Union health ministry and Niti Ayog have acknowledged the portal as a good practice to be implemented across India at the conference held in Delhi on Friday, she added. 
 
 Haryana had also implemented birth companion strategy under which one female attendant would be allowed during delivery in the labour room, she said, addding that the presence of a female birth companion during delivery was a step towards improving the quality of care in labour rooms for improving the maternal and neo-natal outcome and for respectful maternity care.
