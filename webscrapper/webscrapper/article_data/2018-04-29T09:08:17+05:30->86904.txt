The Moon-Kim handshake was historic by all means. But it wasn’t the first handshake that shaped history. Some other handshakes that made history:

 
 
 
 * In Sept 1993, in one of the most dramatic moments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israeli PM Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine’s Yasser Arafat — with US President Bill Clinton’s arms stretched around them — shook hands. 
 
 * The meet yielded autonomy for occupied Palestinian lands, and ended its bloody uprising — the Intifada. Two years later, Rabin was killed by a Jewish extremist opposed to the process. A fresh Intifada broke out in 2000.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 * At a memorial service for   in 2013, US President Obama made headlines when he shook hands with Cuba’s  , the first such public greeting between leaders of the bitter neighbours after decades of enmity.
 
 * Within months, there was a rapid thaw. Full diplomatic relations were restored in July 2015, followed by once-unthinkable steps to mend ties after more than half a century of enmity.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 In a landmark moment in the   peace process, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II met  , a former top commander in the  . He wanted end to British rule in the province, which was a cause for much bloodshed in the region.
 
 
 
 
 After decades of estrangement following a traumatic split at the end of a civil war in 1949, the presidents of China and Taiwan met for the first time in Singapore. In unprecedented scenes, China’s   and Taiwan’s Ma Ying-jeou shook hands for more than a minute and smiled for reporters before holding talks. The summit led to the setting up of a hotline between Beijing and Taipei and a lowering of tensions.
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 The next major handshake on the global calendar is expected to feature   again — this time with US President Trump. But Trump’s awkward handshakes sometimes make headlines for the wrong reasons. Most famously, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe last year appeared to roll his eyes in an apparent expression of relief after a long handshake with Trump in Washington. Quite how Kim might react to an impromptu arm-wrestle, only time will tell.
