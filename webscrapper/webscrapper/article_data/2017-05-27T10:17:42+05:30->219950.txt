  "Sachin: A Billion Dreams" is an Indian biographical film based on the life of Indian   icon and living legend   Tendulkar. A tale of a restless 10-year-old boy and his journey from watching India's first World Cup winning skipper Kapil Dev lift the trophy, to the fulfillment of his dream of holding it in his hands for India. He is the most celebrated sportsperson in India, a virtuous hero who created an era, which Indians are proud of. The film captures Tendulkar's dedication to cricket and his personal life in dramatic detail, as well as reveals aspects of his life which have never been heard or seen before.
 
 
 Sachin Tendulkar plays himself in this sports-docudrama that traces the life and times of one of the world‚Äôs biggest cricket phenomenas.
 
 
 Academically though this film is important one because for a nation that revers cricket, it serves as a reminder that prodigies may be born, but they become Sachin Tendulkar only through perseverance, patience and preparation. Go India go. 
 
 
 
  Sachin - A Billion Dreams has taken a good opening of 30-35% which is better than most of the regular films according to early reports on boxofficeindia.com. Watch this space for more information.
