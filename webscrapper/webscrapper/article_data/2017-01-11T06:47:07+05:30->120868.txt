NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India J S Khehar protested loudly on Tuesday against the non-seriousness on the  's part while filing response to the court on crucial issues, saying the `lackadaisical' approach was evident from the ministries and departments filing reply affidavits through the lowest ranking official - under secretary.

 It all came to a head when the bench headed by the   found that the Centre, which was obliged to audit the accounts of NGOs which received public funds, had scant knowledge of its duty to keep a check on the spending of the money given from the exchequer.“When reply affidavits are filed by under secretaries, what more could one expect,“ the bench observed.
 
 Turning to additional solicitor general Tushar Mehta, the CJI asked -“In your opinion, who should be the officer in all India services should be filing the reply affidavits?“ After giving an hour to   to respond and finding that no response was forthcoming, the bench told him, “Henceforth, no   of the Union government will be permitted to be filed in the SC without it being signed by the joint secretary of the department concerned.“ The court has finally put the accountability on the head of the department and senior officials for every affidavit that would be filed in future.
