LUCKNOW: A day after   Yogi Adityanath’s  , more than 1,000   coming from various districts of the state and   brought traffic around Hazaratganj to a grinding halt on Monday.

 Commuters were caught in snarls around Hazratganj, Vikramaditya Marg, Vidhan Sabha Marg, Charbagh, and Lalbatti crossing and even routes on outskirts of the city, like IIM crossing, remained choked till evening.
 
 Sarika Singh, who had gone to pick her daughter from a prominent convent school near Bandariyabagh, said, “The stretch between Vikramaditya crossing to Lalbatti crossing was in a gridlock, with roadways buses congesting the road. There was no space even to stand on the road.” 
 
 For Vikas Verma, who was coming from Nishatganj, driving on the road was a nightmare. “ I had to catch a train to Bengal from Charbagh. I covered the stretch between Hazratganj crossing and Station road in one hour,” he said.
 
 Paritosh, who was coming from Cantonment road and was stuck in a traffic jam for over 40 minutes, had a similar story to tell. Talking to TOI, he said, “It was complete chaos at Mall flyover. At Lalbatti crossing, people had parked their vehicles in front of the VVIP guest house, which only added to the congestion.”
