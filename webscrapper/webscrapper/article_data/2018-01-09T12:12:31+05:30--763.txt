HYDERABAD: The land belonging to   is being illegally used to accommodate multiplexes, wine shops and shopping malls, residents alleged.

 Resident fighting to protect the land had filed a petition in the   saying that the property being encroached is being put up for sale in the open market.
 
 “Apart from multiplexes and shopping malls being constructed on the lands, people have also set up wine and toddy shops. Three function halls already exist in the area. The open piece of land is now again being encroached by constructing huge boundary walls,” Mir Raza Ali, a resident said.
 
 As there has been no action initiated to protect the waqf land so far, the residents approached   G Kishan Reddy requesting help in protecting the massive piece of land.
 
 The MLA responded by bringing the issue to the notice of chief minister   through a written application seeking immediate action and a thorough inquiry.
 
 “I request your goodselves to kindly look into the matter and advise the concerned officials to protect the wakf lands from the landgrabbers, as the land is meant for the development of the community,” the application read.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, the   CEO was not available for comments.
