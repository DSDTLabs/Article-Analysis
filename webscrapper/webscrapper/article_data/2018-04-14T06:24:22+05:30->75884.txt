JAIPUR: A   (PIL) has been filed in the   against the installation of Dr Ambedkar statue near collectorate at Sawai Madhopur. 

 The petition filed by one Bhuvanesh   who had made principal secretary (home), district collector and CEO of municipal council as respondents said through social media that he came to know that some people are planning to install a statue of Ambedkar at the Indira Circle near collectorate on April 14 on the birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar. 
 
 He feared that this could trigger a caste conflict in the area as the some communities are very agitated over the violence occurred during the Bharat bandh called by the Dalits on April 2.
 
 He pointed out that according to the   order on January 1 2013 Union of India Vs the state of Gujarat, the apex court had categorically stated that state government would not give permission to install the statue of any leader at public places. He contested that if the statue of Dr Ambedkar was installed at the Indira Circle it would not only amount to contempt of court but might create unnecessary tension as other communities would also start installing statues of other leaders.
 
 This would seriously jeopardize the communal harmony in the society, he contested.
