SALIGAO: The issue of constant power fluctuations dominated the Nerul gram sabha on Sunday. Villagers urged the panchayat to look into the matter and arrange a meeting with the engineers or power minister to solve the issue immediately.

 Villagers also raised the issue of non-functional streetlights. Deputy sarpanch   promised to look into the matter. Another villager questioned the sarpanch as to how a road which does not exist is shown on   Maps. Sarpanch   told the villager that the order of the deputy collector will be obtained before constructing the road.
 
 The gram sabha which went on smoothly suddenly broke into chaos when a group of villagers demanded an answer over the constant electricity supply failures in the village. They said that load shedding had damaged several electrical appliances and urged the sarpanch to immediately solve the issue.   said that the department is in the process of providing around 33 KVA of electricity from   to Nerul. 
 
 The villagers retorted saying that even after having several meetings with the assistant engineers and junior engineers nothing has improved. The villagers suggested that they lead a delegation to the office of the assistant engineer or power minister to which sarpanch agreed.
