VASCO: The road built by the   for heavy vehicles to reach the Goa Shipyard Limited ( ) has become a matter of concern for the  . This road is close to the compound wall of the fire station, and is being built to lessen the traffic bottleneck at the shipyard’s gate. 

 Officers from the fire station had written to the PWD three months ago expressing their concerns, and subsequently sent a reminder, too.
 
  One officer pointed out that heavy vehicles would ply on the road, the vibrations of which would likely be damaging to the compound wall.
 
 Four holes that were made in the fire station’s compound wall to drain out rain water and alleviate the flooding problem that the area is prone to, have been obstructed following the construction of the road, officers said. 
 
 Another problem they listed was of the pipeline that lies below the road and supplies water to the 5,000 cubic metre master balancing reservoir.   assistant engineer, Vishwambher Bhende, however, said, “It is a ductile iron pipe, is quite deep and has proper cushioning. It is not in any danger.”
