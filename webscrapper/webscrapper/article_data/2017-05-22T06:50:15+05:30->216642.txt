KOCHI: An organisation working for the  ,  , has started a special cell, which they have named   to monitor the community members who are unfamiliar to them. 

 The group, which played a pivotal role in enrolment of transgender people in the  , says that there is migration of transgender people happening to the city. According to Navas, coordinator of Marvel, they set up a unit to monitor illegal activities by the community members unfamiliar among them after continuous talks with police officials.
 
 "Top police officers during meetings with us, used to say that there are people from our community indulging in crimes like chain snatching and pick-pocketing. We took this into consideration and decided to monitor those we don't know," said Navas. "Other than collecting information about them. we also monitor them to check whether they are involved in any illegal activities. The move is in the wake of the community members in the city losing face because of the crime committed by outsiders," said Navas adding that even if they found any illegal activities by outsiders they were not in a position to act on it.
 
 The unit says that they are in talks with the police for a solution to the problem. "We are willing to cooperate. But revealing the identity of everyone to police is not practical, as many community members would have problems as it is a sensitive gender issue. However, in case of new people coming into the city and engaging in criminal activities, we can definitely share information about them to the police or the concerned authorities," said the association members.
 
 According to a senior police officer, there are reports about offences committed in late night. "We are conducting discussions with them and are trying to find a solution for it," said Kochi city deputy commissioner Yathish Chandra.
