CHANDIGARH: Shri Dhanwantry Medical College and Dabur Dhanwantry Hospital of Sector 46B, which was earlier affiliated to Panjab University, has sought this status once again for opening a new college and introducing 13 courses in the session 2018-19. The PU   will take up the matter on Saturday (February 24).

The syndicate had decided further to keep ayurvedic colleges under the faculty of medical science.

  The matter had also reached the Punjab and Haryana high court. The same college has now sought affiliation for the new campus and has already got an NOC from the UT Administration. However, the NOC from the  , department of Ayush, ministry of Ayush, is also required.
