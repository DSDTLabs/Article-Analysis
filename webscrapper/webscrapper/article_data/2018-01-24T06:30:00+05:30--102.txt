Hubballi:  , which can clock speeds of up to 180-200kmph, are likely to run between   and Bengaluru after the ongoing track doubling work is completed, said Dharwad MP  .

 Joshi told TOI that he has been demanding that Centre sanction a high-speed train between Hubballi and Bengaluru. “It will be a reality only after the completion of the doubling of tracks. The track doubling work may be completed by 2020. I have approached the ministry of railways which assured of sanctioning a semi high-speed train or Talgo train,” Joshi said.
 
 Sources in the Railways said Talgo coaches will have features including natural tilting leading to higher speeds on curves, independent axle-less wheels, lightweight aluminium body coaches, disc brake system, articulated wheels to keep wheel parallel to track, integrated suspension, enhanced passenger comfort and they are designed for operational speed of 200kmph.
 
 At present, it takes more than eight hours to commute between Hubballi and Bengaluru. The journey time will reduce to five hours if the Talgo train is introduced.
 
 However, it may be recalled that the Railway ministry, after the trial of a Talgo train in 2016, formed a committee to look into the matter of introducing such trains between Delhi-Lucknow, Mumbai-Ahmedabad or Bengaluru-Chennai. However, no progress has been made so far.
 
 Railway activist Rohith Jain expressed doubts over the project becoming a reality in the near future but stressed that there is a need of introducing a high speed train from Hubballi.
 
 “There are 13 railway zones in the country. No high-speed train such as  ,   or   originates from Hubballi, which is the headquarters of the South Western Railway. This is because of the negligent attitude of the governments towards Karnataka. Let them first introduce a Shatabdi between Hubballi and Bengaluru as the   takes much time to reach the cities,” he said.
