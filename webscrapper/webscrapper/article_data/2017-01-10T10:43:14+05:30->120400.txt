CHENNAI: Bringing cheer to the city, the   released   on Monday. If the present rate of flow of 1,000 cusecs (cubic feet per second) is maintained, the city could get a month's supply of water (1 tmcft) in 10-12 days.The water from Kandaleru reservoir in   will reach Poondi in two to three days.

 Due to the failed northeast monsoon, the combined level of the four city reservoirs on Monday was only 14% of the total capacity, and the city was staring at an acute water crisis. The release of Krishna water comes two days after   chief minister   sought the intervention of his Andhra Pradesh counterpart N Chan drababu Naidu to ensure the immediate release of `agreed' quantum of water. While the TN government had asked for 3 tmcft, the AP gov ernment had indicated to TOI that 1-2tmcft would be released. In his letter to Naidu, Panneerselvam wrote, “I am given to understand that as on Thursday, the water level at Kandaleru reservoir was 13.5tmcft (thousand million cubic feet). Therefore, AP appears to be in a position to release water for Chennai city.“
 
 Pointing out to the 1983 inter state agreement, which promises a quantum of 12tmcft of water to be released at the TN border in two spells from the Kandaleru reservoir, Panneerselvam wrote that only 0.99tmcft had been realised between October and December last year.The agreement mandates a supply of 8tmcft from July to October and 4tmcft from January to April to the state. While the city reservoirs address the bulk of the daily water needs of the residents, water managers take recourse to Veeranam lake, desalination plants at Nemmili and Minjur, and farm wells. The water supply began in October last year was suspended twice owing to illegal tapping of water along the canal that takes water to Poondi reservoir in Tiruvallur district. Krishna water flow was again suspended in December on account of cyclone Vardah as per guidelines.
