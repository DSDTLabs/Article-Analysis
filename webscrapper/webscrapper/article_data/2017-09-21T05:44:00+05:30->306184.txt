Nagpur: Aiming to promote the concept of learning apart from academics, Gurukul.education is organizing a series of workshop ‘Learnathon’ powered by The Times of India on September 24 at Chitnavis Centre, Civil Lines.

 The event has created a buzz in the city with almost 2,200 pre-registrations, as per the organizers.
 
 Altogether 84 workshops will be conducted wherein people, irrespective of age and gender, can have a taste of various activities under one roof.
 
 “The main idea behind the workshops is to promote learning as a holistic approach towards knowledge rather just academic learning. People make barriers around themselves and limit the learning process just up to the things we learn in schools and colleges, but they fail to realize that there are numerous things in the world to educate ourselves,” said Anup Dubey, co-founder of Gurukul.education.
 
 Dubey said the event is being organized by the students of the institution and who worked on every aspect to conceptualize and market the programme.
 
 “Around two months ago, we surveyed the citizens and designed the workshops as per feedback. Some sessions are very basic like how to tie a tie, gift wrapping, email writing and many more while some are advanced courses like GST workshop, depression, beat boxing and others,” he added.
 
 All the workshops will be conducted simultaneously and sessions are designed in such a way that one student can attend around 12 workshops throughout the day. Each conclave has a specified time duration and will be administered by an expert in the respective field.
