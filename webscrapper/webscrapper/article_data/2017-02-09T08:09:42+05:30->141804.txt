NEW DELHI: Sachin Tyagi wanted to   his children with a gift that he had bought and kept in his car hours before it caught fire and charred him. His family last heard from him a few minutes before the incident when he called his wife and asked her to prepare dinner.

 The family was inconsolable when cops recovered the remains of the gift he had left on the front passenger’s seat. His body was handed over to the family after an autopsy on Wednesday.
 
 Tyagi had been staying at   with his wife, Mamata, mother and two children for the past five years. His father had passed away a few months ago and his brother drives a cab in Ghaziabad. “He was the sole breadwinner and had been treating his mother’s ailment with his meagre income. He had to work extra hours to meet the demands of the family,” said a relative.
 
 The victim had bought the car around 18 months ago from a showroom in east Delhi on a loan for five years. He got it refurbished for ferrying passengers. “He loved to take care of his car and spent almost half the day on it. It was really shocking for us when we heard that the vehicle had gone up in flames,” said Atul Kumar, a neighbour.
 
 Family members said that a proper inspection will reveal what caused the fire. “Generally, a fuel leakage due to a faulty line in the engine bay coupled with a short circuit can trigger a fire. But this possibility is bleak if the car is new,” said Kumar.
 
 Though the family has not registered a complaint about foul play, Tyagi’s relatives said that a witness told them about two people suspiciously running away just before the car caught fire. Police said they are probing the allegation.
