DARJEELING: The   of a   (DHR)   derailed at Mahanadi, 8kms from   (from Darjeeling end), on Tuesday afternoon, injuring six persons, including three tourists. The cause could not be ascertained immediately but sources said   due to rain could have led to the   

 The train had started for New Jalpaiguri from Darjeeling at 10.15am. When it reached Mahanadi, the wheels of the locomotive came off the tracks at a turning near Dhungey Kothi. In the process, the locomotive toppled, dragging the first coach behind it. 
 
 “Some passengers received minor injuries and were taken to the Kurseong sub-division hospital for treatment,” said Darjeeling DM Anurag Srivastava. “We don’t know the exact cause but the slippery conditions could be a reason, particularly as the train was negotiating a sharp curve. We have initiated an inquiry,” said DHR director M D Bhutia. 
 
 There were nearly 50 passengers on board when the train derailed. Tindharia assistant divisional mechanical engineer S Dutta said: “Restoration work was hampered as there was no electricity. The tracks have got bent due to the pressure but we hope to rectify the damage and restore services by Wednesday,” he said. 
 
 Most Kolkata-bound tourists didn’t suffer injuries and special vehicles were arranged to take them to Siliguri. Many of the passengers complained of police and DHR inaction though.
