LUDHIANA: A 32-year-old woman accused an 80-year-old   and his friend of gang-raping her at his house in Lehra village, Ahemadgarh, on Tuesday. 

 The woman said in her police complaint, “A friend of my husband told us that an NRI, who has returned home after years and lives alone, was looking for a domestic help, who could   too. I called up the NRI and joined work on Tuesday.” 
 
 The woman reached Ahemadgarh, Ludhiana district, by bus. “From there, the NRI took me to his house in a car. He showed me his house and said I could bring my family along and live there. He then asked me to wash his clothes and cook food,” she added.
 
 When she was busy with the household chores, a man came to visit the NRI. “The NRI’s friend forcibly took me to a room and raped me. Some time later, the NRI too joined him,” she told the police. 
 
 After the duo left, the woman called up her husband. “When my husband and mother-in-law reached his house, the NRI escaped along with his friend.” 
 
 Dehlon police station SHO said a case under Section of 376-D (gang rape) of the IPC has been registered. “A thorough investigation will be conducted before arresting the accused,” the SHO added.
