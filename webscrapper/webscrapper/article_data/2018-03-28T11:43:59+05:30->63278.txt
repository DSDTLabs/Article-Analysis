PANAJI: Public works department (PWD) has undertaken the construction of a major   on the Cortim end of the hillside of  , Panaji at an estimated expense of Rs 2.5 crore.

 Expected to be complete before the upcoming monsoon, the approximately 200mt-long wall with a height of about 20-25 metres is being made to prevent collapse of the hillside, thereby protecting the high court building and houses on the other side of Altinho from damage due to possible landslips. The new wall will be the first structure of its kind to be constructed at Altinho as a preventive measure.
 
 Hundreds of old-structured houses and government offices are situated on the Altinho hillock besides bureaucrats’ residential quarters. Altinho residents, had, in the past petitioned the town and country planning department, PWD and the corporation of the city of Panaji about unplanned construction activity on the hill.
 
 In 2009, Geological Survey of India (GSI) had studied the unstable areas on Altinho hillock and recommended soil nailing as a protective measure to arrest landslips during monsoon. The vulnerable spots for landslides identified were located around the high court of Bombay at Goa, Fr Agnelo road, the area behind the now-closed Hotel Samrat and the Mala slope.
 
 Former Panaji MLA   inspected the wall’s construction work on Tuesday, along with PWD executive engineer Sunil Raikar, and the contractor handling the project.
