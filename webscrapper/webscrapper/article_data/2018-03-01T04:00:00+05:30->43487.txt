Vadodara: Two robbers targeted an ornaments manufacturer in crowded Khanderao Market area on Wednesday evening and stole silver ornaments worth over Rs 1 lakh. 
 
 Hetal Shah, an ornaments manufacturer living in Ghadiyali Pol for 20 years, had come to deliver ornaments at a jewellery shop in Vrajsiddhi Tower near Khanderao Market crossroads on Wednesday evening. When Shah was parking his two-wheeler, the two robbers called him but he did not go there and went to deliver the ornaments. 
  
 After 30 minutes when Shah came back, his two-wheeler’s tyres were deflated. He called the shop’s owner to whom he had come to deliver the ornaments and requested him to keep the bag of jewellery in his shop until his vehicle’s tyres were mended. The shop owner sent a man identified as Mukesh Patel from his shop to get the bags. When Patel was climbing the staircases of the commercial complex with the two bags, one of the robbers who had worn a red cap came near him, snatched one of the bags and ran away. 
  
 Patel immediately ran behind the robber but he and his accomplice, who was waiting on his bike at a short distance, fled away towards Khanderao Market. Meanwhile, a tea seller who witnessed the act also ran behind the bike for a distance but the accused managed to escape despite of heavy traffic in the area. 
  
 After the incident, a big crowd gathered there and the police was also called. Cops have taken footages of CCTV cameras installed nearby and have started investigations on the basis of it. Police have not ruled out involvement of an insider since the two accused were already waiting when Shah reached the complex and they called him specifically even in a crowded locality.
