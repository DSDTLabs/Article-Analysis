NOIDA: Even as RWA federation has sent out circulars across sector RWAs to ensure implementation of plastic bag ban initiated by authority, it has written to   reiterating the need to ensure stray dog sterilization job which is nor carried out despite repeated complaints.

 "With a view to ensure polythene free environs and to implement the plastic/polythene bag ban drive initiated by authority, we have forwarded the circular issued by authority to all sector RWAs so that they can implement and monitor the same at their end. Apart from this we have reiterated to authority CEO   to look into the the stray dog menace as the job of sterilisation is not happening up to the mark," said N P Singh, president   Welfare Associations ( ).
 
 A N Dhawan secretary general FONRWA maintained that though there's a deployment of an agency for carrying out the sterilization of stray dogs by authority, it has not been carrying out the job to satisfaction. "There's an essential need to augment the process with deployment of 2/3 more agencies as also to bring forth required improvements in the system/ process being followed by the present agency, with a view to meet alarming situation as reminders from member RWAs to attend to dog sterisation process in many residential sectors remain unattended even after 15/20 days from the date of lodging of their complaints. Priority complaints too are not being taken care of promptly," said Dhawan urging Tandon to issue the agency necessary directions to attend to the complaints lodged by FONRWA.
