While many students found the class XII language paper-I exam held on Thursday easy,  

 Those who had opted for Tamil and French said there were a couple of twisted questions, which required that they had read the textbook thoroughly. Language teachers were also of the same view.
 
 “In the Tamil paper, there were a couple of unexpected questions in the short answer section. Among the objective questions, some were from the textbook. The paper was easy otherwise,” said Rohit, a class XII student from a city school.
 
 “The Tamil paper was easy. But, only those who had read the textbook fully would have been able to get all the answers right,” said a Tamil teacher.
 
 In the French paper too, there were objective questions that the students found confusing. “They had changed the questions a bit and some questions also seemed incomplete,” said Ukkash, another Class XII student. 
 
 The students said they felt such questions were introduced to reduce the number of centums. However, apart from such surprises, the French paper too was easy.
 
 A total of 36,833 students from the Coimbatore revenue district have registered for the Class XII board exams. Of this, around 422 were absent on Thursday, said education department officials. The students wrote the exams in around 113 examination centres.
