DIBRUGARH: Students of Dibrugarh will no longer have to stand in a queue to pay their fees as the university has gone the cashless way. 

 Students could now pay their fees online through an e-payment gateway available on the   online services portal (https://dibru.online), registrar MN Dutta said on Wednesday.
 
 "Through this portal, students can also keep track of their payment history and receive notifications on their dues. The university is also making provisions for other stakeholders to make online payments through the same portal," the registrar added.
 
 He revealed that from the academic session 2016-17, the university had been using online application submission system for   (DURAT) where the payment gateway was integrated to enable online payment. No candidate had to come to the university campus and stand in a queue while applying for admission, Dutta said. The process had reduced paperwork and made the system more efficient, accurate and transparent, he added.
 
 The most important and unique feature of the   adopted by Dibrugarh University, according to Dutta, is that neither the stakeholder nor the university has to pay any transaction charge while paying through online modes like credit card, debit card and internet banking.
 
 As the result of an agreement between the payment gateway provider, the bank and Dibrugarh University, the transaction charges fixed by the   for online transactions have been waived for Dibrugarh University and its stakeholders.
