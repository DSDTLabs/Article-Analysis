Students of Impact College of Engineering and Applied Sciences recently participated in a seminar on   conservation. Associate Professor K Satish, during his thesis, collected data of Bengaluru and surrounding areas, spanning over 111 years, over a period of six months and studied the same, understanding the impact of urbanisation and encroachment in the city.

 “Through my thesis, I classified the data further into seasons and realised that Bengaluru receives low to medium precipitation due to rainfall. There are 13 observatory wells in and around Bengaluru and the same are maintained by CGWB and Department of Mines and Geology. These wells are monitored four times in a year during May (pre-monsoon), August, November (post-monsoon) and January. Owing to the rapid and haphazard urban development, the infiltration of water has decreased, resulting in low ground water levels. I believe the ground water levels will go down drastically by 2030,” says Satish.
 
 The professor says that the objective of having a seminar like this is to create awareness not just among students, but others as well. “I wanted to share the findings with my students, who in turn will tell others about the same. Just saving water is not enough; conservation of water is the need of the hour. We want to educate people and tell them before it’s too late,” says Satish, adding that in the coming days the college will organise a walkathon to create awareness about the topic.
