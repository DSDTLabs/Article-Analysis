MUMBAI: The number of beds in state-run   (SNCUs) has remained stagnant for five years, even as   increased by 15% and babies in need of acute care doubled. Appallingly, it took the   of 55 infants at   Civil Hospital’s SNCU for the authorities to wake up and overnight place orders for warmers and non-invasive ventilators.

 The 36 SNCUs in the state with 660 beds catered to 50,373 babies in 2016-17, of which a significant number were born premature and weighed less than 1,000gm. Five years back, the SNCUs treated 25,147 babies, half of the present inflow. But as patient load increased at these centres, many of which are starved of doctors and trained nurses, the state did little to strengthen manpower or infrastructure. 
 
 Sources told TOI the last effort by Directorate of Health Services (DHS) to add infant beds was in 2015, when a tender to procure 719 infant warmers and 380 phototherapy units was floated. More than two years later and close to 25 events of re-tendering and postponing the purchase, the exercise is likely to be scrapped now. “DHS wanted the warmers to have CE marking (certification to trade in European Union areas) and US FDA approval, knowing well that most Indian manufacturers only have CE certification. Thus, the tender was never fulfilled and procurements never happened. The last major procurement by DHS was in 2011, when it purchased 743 warmers,” said a bidder. 
 
 “Despite several representations, the government was adamant on he specifications. The medical colleges that run NICUs, which are a level above SNCUs, have no qualms about only using warmers with CE certification,” said another manufacturer of infant warmers. 
 
 The problems of bureaucracy and inadequate infrastructure ails tertiary   of Mumbai in same measure. At BMC-run BYL Nair Hospital, a tender to procure 18 warmers has been lying idle for a year. A doctor told TOI, “We often rely on donations to buy warmers, incubators and ventilators for babies. Since NICUs in public hospitals are always overflowing, it is usual for more than one baby to occupy one warmer.” Nair Hospital dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal said the tender was tied up due to GST regulations, but has now been cleared for processing. 
 
 DHS head Dr Satish Pawar denied government laxity. “The solution is not merely in expanding beds. In fact, deaths in SNCUs declined from 11% to 7% over the years due to infection control and other measures. Even Mumbai’s tertiary-care medical colleges don’t have these survival rates,” he said, adding that doctors in SNCUs work against extremely trying situations to save babies. “At the Nashik hospital, more than 90% were preterm and weighed under 1.5kg,” said public health minister Dr Deepak Sawant. He announced that eight SNCUs would be commissioned along with three NICUs at the district level.
 
 But health activist and paediatrician Dr Abhay Bang, who has been working for decades towards sustainable healthcare in Gadchiroli, said the state would once again be missing the woods for the trees if the focus remains solely on beefing up SNCUs. “SNCUs are a tip of the newborn mortality problem and cater to merely 10% ailing newborns. Most deaths happen in the community and public health data barely captures that,” he said. “Statistically, more than two lakh newborns need SNCU care but only a minuscule reach them,” he said. Dr Bang suggested that the state should empower health workers to treat mild and moderately ill newborns so that only critical ones reach SNCUs. 
 
 Dr Pawar said ASHAs will administer antibiotics to ill children and stabilise them before bringing them to a medical centre.
