AURANGABAD:   workers continued with their agitation on Friday over the government’s failure to approve the remuneration that it had promised a few months ago. 

 Hundreds of workers affiliated to Anganwanwadi Balwadi Karmcharti Kruti Samiti took out a morcha from AITUC office to the zilla parishad here demanding the government to immediately approve their increased remuneration as was agreed by the ministers and officials cocerned about four months ago.
 
 Addressing the workers at the zilla parishad, CPI leader   said that the morcha was taken out as a part of the state-wide agitation to draw attention of the government towards its promises. “This is an exercise aimed at preparing for the September 11 state-wide agitations planned by anganwadi and balwadi workers. We have also served a notice to the government that, if they fail to consider our demand by then, we will resort to state wide indefinite strike on September 11,” said Baheti.
 
 “Earlier, we had planned a state-wide agitation from April 1, however, finance minister   and minister for women and child development   promised to look into the matter and said that they would immediately issue a government resolution in this regard. Though we had demanded Rs 20,000 and Rs 15,000 for anganwadi workers and their helpers, respectively, the government had agreed to pay Rs 7,500 and Rs 5,000 instead. They were expected to issue a GR in this respect within two months. However, almost four months have passed and the government has done nothing in these directions,” he said.
 
 He also said that about two-years-ago, the government had agreed to pay Rs 1 lakh and Rs 75,000 to anganwadi workers and helpers, respectively as a one time amount on their retirement. These schemes were implemented for some time after which people were made to run from pillar to post and still haven’t received the amount. We have also highlighted this issue and the government had promised to look into it, but to no avail,” Baheti added.
