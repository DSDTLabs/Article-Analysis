AGRA:   ministers   and  , who were in Agra on Wednesday, said that opposition parties, including SP, BSP and Congress, had a hand in the widespread violence during the Dalit agitation on Monday.
 
  Maurya, who was formerly with BSP and is currently UP labour minister in the BJP government, said that since the opposition has “run out of valid issues”, it is misguiding people and creating a divide in society for political benefits. “Those violent protests were planned by BSP and supported by SP and Congress. The BJP government is functioning in an unbiased manner and is committed to the welfare of weaker sections,” he said.
  
  Meanwhile, Khanna, who holds the urban development portfolio, said, “I personally do not think that the Supreme Court order has in any way diluted the SC/ST Act. Members of Dalit community were misled and provoked by the opposition. They were told that the government was also trying to change the reservation policy.” 
  
  Maurya said that taking note of the discontentment among the Dalits, the BJP government at the Centre filed a review petition in the apex court. “Everyone should have faith in the Supreme Court and must wait for its final judgment. BJP will do everything to protect the interest of Dalits,” he said.
  
  “It is unfortunate that BSP chief   is alleging that the SC/ST Act has been diluted. When she was UP chief minister, her Cabinet had taken a similar decision to ensure that the act was not misused. At that time, no violent protests were held. Now, for political gains, BSP is misleading youngsters,” said Maurya.
  
  On his visit to Agra, Maurya inaugurated a registration camp for construction labourers. He distributed certificates of over Rs 4.22 crore to 8566 construction workers under various schemes run by the state government. On the other hand, Suresh Khanna chaired meeting of Agra officials and reviewed development-related works in the City of Taj.
