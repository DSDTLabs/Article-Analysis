NEW DELHI: A 50-year-old freelance journalist was robbed of jewellery worth Rs 25 lakh and Rs. 30,000 cash by two men after they fed her dog and made a friendly entry inside. The incident was captured on cameras installed both inside and outside the house in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar.

 Police said that the journalist, Mrinali Singh, and her family members were away from home when the incident took place. The two men came to the woman’s house at 1 pm. They broke the lock and entered, only to rush out when they noticed a Labrador dog trying to chase them away. Police said that after 20 minutes, they came back to the house with dog biscuits and fed the dog. Police said that the men spent around five minutes inside the house and fled with a bag full of jewellery and cash. 
 
 When Singh returned at 3 pm, she said nothing in her room was kept at its actual place. She then made a PCR call.
