CHANDIGARH: Divyanshu  , the first elected president of the Haryana unit of the   (NSUI)—the student wing of the Congress—on Tuesday flayed chief minister   and ‘thanked him’ for helping him get noticed.

 Divyanshu, along with Hardik Nain, was released from Ambala jail on Monday night after a   court granted bail to both in a case registered against them on January 5. Both student leaders were charged with obstructing a government official in discharging his duty during CM Manohar Lal Kahttar’s direct dialogue with students at the Government Post Graduate College, Panchkula on Friday.
 
 Budhiraja, Nain and others raised anti-government slogans and waved black flags. Later, they were rounded up and a case was slapped against them. “Thank you CM Khattar for helping me get fame. My voice would have gone unheard if you didn’t order the registration of case and your people didn’t make the viral video,” said Budhiraja.
 
 “Khattar Sahib, you blamed me for resorting to politics. Yes, we do politics, not of your kind which set Haryana ablaze thrice in three years. Not like your party that had been betraying the youth, students and a cross section of society,” he said after his release from the jail.
