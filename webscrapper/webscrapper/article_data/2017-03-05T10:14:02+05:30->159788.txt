NASHIK: Going tough against the   evaders, the civic body officials on Saturday decided a unique method to recover its dues.

  (NMC) have planned a unique scheme where they will be beating drums outside the commercial and residential property owners who have evading tax worth Rs 1 lakh or more.
 
 Despite show cause notices and seizure of properties, NMC failed to recover taxes from defaulters. Dhol tasha will be played in front of the defaulters’ properties with the hope that the defaulters would pay up due to public embarrassment.
 
 NMC has appointed 18 squads for recovering taxes before the end of this fiscal. In a span of three days these squads have visited different divisions and have recovered taxes or seizing properties.
 
 They have seized seven properties in Panchavati division on Saturday, two in   (CIDCO) and two in Nashik East. They have recovered taxes up to Rs 30.60 on Saturday.
 
 “We have recovered a sum of Rs 1.07 crore as property tax and have sealed 18 properties in the past three days,” said deputy municipal commissioner Rohidas Dorkulkar.
 
 He said, “In order to have maximise property tax recovery scheme, NMC will be using dhol tasha which has been a success in other cities as well.”
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   told TOI that they would be starting with the dhol tasha drive for tax recovery from next week onwards.
 
 In the meanwhile, notices have been issued to 200 mobile phone towers to pay their taxes by next Thursday. If they fail to pay their taxes NMC will start sealing the towers. These tower owners have to pay Rs 2-3 crore to the NMC.
