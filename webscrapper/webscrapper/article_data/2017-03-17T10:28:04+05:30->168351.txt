BARASAT: A 63-year-old man, a father of three, got the shock of his life when a   showed he had a uterus, ovaries and adnexa, and even mentioned his gender as “female”.   from Machhlandapur has lodged a complaint.

 Down with stomach and lower-abdomen pain for a while, Sen was seeing a local doctor. When medicines did not work, the doctor advised him to get a USG of the whole abdomen done. Following a USG at Barasat Cancer Research & Welfare Centre, Sen collected the report on Wednesday. He did not even read the report and so was unaware that three female organs — ovary, uterus and adnexa — have been included in his document, which also had the reports of pancreas, gall bladder, liver and spleen. 
 
 On seeing the doctor’s expression of shock, Sen broke into a sweat. The doctor assured him the report “seemed fine except that he appeared to be a woman”. “How could they make such gross mistake?” said Sen, who went to the Barasat police station. 
 
 “It could have been a printing mistake. We are probing how the error crept in,” said  , a member of the committee that runs the Barasat Cancer Research and Welfare Centre.
