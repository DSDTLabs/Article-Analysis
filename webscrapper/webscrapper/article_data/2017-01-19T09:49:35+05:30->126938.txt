Reality TV star   has been embracing leading a quieter life out of the spotligth with her kids.
 
  The 36-year-old beauty retreated from the spotlight after being robbed at gunpoint in October.
  
  Despite initially being too "shocked or traumatised" to do very much, she has enjoyed having a break to spend quality time with her and husband Kanye West's kids, three-year-old North, and Saint, 13 months, reported Femalefirst.
  
  
 
  
  "Taking time off after the robbery has really changed Kim for the better. She initially was just too shocked and traumatised to deal with anything but her kids but as time went on she realised she actually loved her slower life," a source said.
  
  "She feels very grateful that she has been able to spend the past few months just focusing on North and Saint. Kim thinks they are growing too fast and has enjoyed spending more quiet time with them."
