COLVA: Parents, who met in Mumbai for a two day 2nd national meet under the aegis of India Wide  , resolved to approach the central government to demand framing and enacting a central fee regulatory act and appointing central and state-level fee regulatory committees to checkmate growing commercialization of education by private players.

 Parentsâ€™ associations across India, including legal experts and well-known activists in the field of education who deliberated at the meet, felt that the government has neglected education in India and private players, taking advantage of the situation, have made it a highly profitable business. The main concern of parents is the rising cost of education without significant rise in infrastructure and quality of education.
 
 National parents body resolved that central, private and state boards be made more accountable to ensure infrastructure, affordability, quality and transparency.
 
 Orlando Pacheco, who represented Goa parents at the 2nd National meet in Mumbai, said that it is high time the state and the national governments should take concrete steps to reform the education policy, implement existing laws and address this issue in all seriousness.
 
 The parents demanded that the central and state government improve the quality of all government-run schools, aided schools and to open more   level schools in rural and urban areas of the country or convert all gvernment schools to   level schools.
 
 It was unanimously resolved that the draft of the new educational policy should be scrapped and the existing policy should be amended in conformity with the directive policy of the constitution.
