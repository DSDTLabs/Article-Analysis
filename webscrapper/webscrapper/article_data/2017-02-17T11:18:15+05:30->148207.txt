ETAWAH: Chief minister and   president   on Thursday said “some people whom I trusted, tried to create differences between me and Netaji ( ), but people of my home town (Etawah) will teach them a lesson”.

 “I will not tolerate any conspiracy against party and Netaji. I have also heard that some people have earned too much money, but we were not probing such cases. However, if someone submits an application, the matter will be probed thoroughly,” Akhilesh said without elaborating.
 
 “I also know that a group of people is working secretly to defeat the cycle, whereas some others are considering formation of a new party. These people had earlier tried to snatch the cycle, but no one can take it from the Samajwadis. We have saved the cycle, now it’s your duty to ensure it wins,” Akhilesh said at a rally held in Numaish Maidan in favour of SP candidate from Etawah Sadar, Kuldeep Gupta.
 
 “Nai party banane se kuch nahin hota, asli party toh Samajwadi Party hai (Forming a new party is of no consequence, Samajwadi Party is the original party),” he added.
 
 “Irrespective of against whom we are fighting, I am sure that Samajwadis are united,” said the CM while seeking blessings from the masses. “If we win and form government in UP again, it will increase the ‘samman’ (honour) of Netaji.”
 
 Earlier in the day too, Akhilesh had made an apparent reference to the recent family feud while addressing a rally in Karhal, Mainpuri, another stronghold of the Yadav family. “Some people attempted to take my exam in politics recently, but I was patient and took decisions according to time and circumstances. Leaders and workers along with the party organisation helped me come out of the crisis,” he said.
