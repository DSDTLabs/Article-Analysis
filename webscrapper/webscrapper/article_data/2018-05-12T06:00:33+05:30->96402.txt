PUNE: An IndiGo   to Chennai, which was preparing to take off from the   on Thursday, ran into a technical glitch with one of its doors not shutting. 

 
 The flight (6E-302) with more than 100 passengers was scheduled to take off from Pune at 1:45pm. However, once the boarding was done and the passengers were seated, the flight attendants realized that one of the doors in the front was not closing.
 
 A   the flight tweeted with a picture, "Door isn't closing. Six people trying. Would you take this flight?"
 
 Another passenger, who requested anonymity, said, "The flight was about to taxi for the take-off when the snag was noticed apparently while closing the door. With the cabin crew not able to shut the door, six engineers were called in. The passengers were told to be patient. We sat in the plane for a long time until things could be rectified. There was frustration for sure but then we were lucky that the snag was noticed before take-off."
 
 The flight finally took off at 4:51pm and reached Chennai around 6pm. "If the flight was on schedule, we would have landed in Chennai at 3:30pm. The   should have deplaned us and made us wait in the terminal building. Even if the airline thought the aircraft was ready to make the journey after the snag was fixed, some passengers were scared during the flight. The flight should have been changed," the passenger said.
 
 However, IndiGo said that the delay was minor. "While preparing for departure, some interference was noted while closing the passenger entry door. The technical team did a thorough check prior to departure to ensure door operation was satisfactory. The aircraft was cleared post-inspection. This process resulted in a minor delay," a spokesperson of the airline told TOI.
