HYDERABAD: A distinct drop in temperature in the city on Wednesday failed to bring much respite to denizens, who were left sweating profusely all through the day. Reason: a sharp rise in   in the state. 

 According to the readings of the India Meteorological Department, Hyderabad, the relative humidity that was restricted to 24% until Tuesday shot up drastically within 24 hours to settle at a high 40% on Wednesday. "The rising humidity levels are because of moisture-laden winds blowing from the eastern parts of the country, which are in close proximity to the Bay of Bengal," said  , director (in-charge) of IMD, Hyderabad. "The heat in the city is of the base order of 45 degrees Celsius. When this is met with air filled with humidity, it is bound to lead to heat-discomfort," he added
 
 Residents couldn't agree more. In fact, many were left stunned to know that Wednesday's temperature had fallen below the 40 degree Celsius mark - the highest recorded during the day was 39.2 degree Celsius. 
 
 "This comes as bit of a surprise because I thought that today (Wednesday) was much warmer than other days. It could be because the day was very sticky and humid," said Nandhini S, a resident of Begumpet.
 
 Given the change in the summer 'pattern', many even complained of sudden dizziness and nausea. "Though the temperatures have hit higher degrees in the past, the last few days have been more difficult to survive in comparison to those days. I guess that's because people in the city aren't very used to handling humidity. The weather here is largely dry," said  , a resident of Gachibowli, ruing how air-coolers are proving unhelpful because of the rising humidity levels.
 
 But with IMD predicting no rainfall over the following days and instead issuing heat wave warning across parts of the state over the next 24 hours, residents are unlikely to find any respite from the sticky weather any time soon.
