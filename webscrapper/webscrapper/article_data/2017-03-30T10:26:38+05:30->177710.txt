PONDA: Ponda MLA  , on Wednesday, said that the taluka’s sewage treatment plants will be set at the proposed sites of Kavlem and  . 

 Villagers of both areas had opposed the setting up of the STPs and the Bandora panchayat had even resolved to revoke the permission issued for the Undir plant.
 
 Naik said he had been informed by the sewage corporation official that roads in the area had already been dug up for laying sewage pipes and as such the STPs would come up at the earmarked sites.
 
 The Ponda legislator held a meeting with officials of the  , sewage infrastructure development corporation and electricity department on Wednesday to take stock of developmental works in the constituency. 
 
 Post the meeting, Naik told reporters that all the roads in the constituency damaged due to the sewerage work would be temporarily repaired by the corporation.
 
 Naik added that he had informed the PWD’s water division official to replace the old pipelines as they faced the risk of rupturing. Additionally, he said that he would move a proposal for the construction of three overhead water reservoirs - two at   and one at Curti - to solve the irregular water supply issue.
 
 Durgabhat has a shortage of potable water supply and the department presently supplies the same by way of tankers.
 
 The need to change the electricity conductors across the town was also brought up in the meeting by Naik.
