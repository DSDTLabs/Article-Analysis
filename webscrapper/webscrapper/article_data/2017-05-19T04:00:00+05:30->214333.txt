Mumbai: Malaysian   Khazanah, which runs the worldâ€™s second largest healthcare group Integrated Healthcare Holdings ( ), on Thursday sold its remaining shares in   for about Rs 830 crore, triggering speculation that it was preparing an aggressive bid for Fortis Healthcare.

 On Wednesday night, IHH had put up 66.5 lakh shares of Apollo Hospitals, 4.8% of the company, up for sale through the accelerated book-building method at a share price of Rs 1,245-1,260. Deutsche Bank was the sole manager to the offer 
 
 After the deal was executed on NSE, Apollo shares closed 2.4% lower at Rs 1,275 on BSE. This is the second stake sale by IHH in Apollo. In March this year, the firm had offloaded 6% stake in Apollo for about Rs 1,060 crore.
 
 Industry players are speculating that IHH, with nearly Rs 2,000 crore in kitty, is a strong contender to buy a controlling stake in Fortis. It is seen vying with private equity consortium of TPG and General Atlantic to acquire Fortis with a market value of $1.6 billion. 
 
 IHH had bought into Apollo in 2011, at an average cost of Rs 480. After holding the shares for nearly six years, it exited Apollo at a price 2.5 times its entry price.
