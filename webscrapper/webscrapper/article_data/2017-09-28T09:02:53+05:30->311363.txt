JODHPUR: In yet another relief to the film actor   in a matter pertaining to a poaching case of Jodhpur, the trial court here rejected the application of prosecution accusing Khan of misleading the court for seeking exemption from appearance in the court.

 Magistrate Dev Kumar Khatri had completed the arguments on this application on September 23 and had reserved the order to be pronounced on Wednesday.
 
 Counsel for Khan, HM Saraswat said that the then forest officer Lalit Bora had moved an application in the trial court objecting to the ground presented by Khan while seeking exemption from appearance in the court for recording of the accused statements in a case against him under Arms Act.
 
 “Khan had to appear in the court on April 23, 2015 for recording of the accused statements but he could not appear in the court on account of the pain in ear which recommended not to travel by air,” said Saraswat.
 
 But Bora moved an application in the court challenging the ground stating that Khan misled the court as he was shooting for his film Bajrangi Bhaijan in Kashmir then.
 
 “We argued in the court that his pain did not bar him from working but travelling by air. The doctors had prohibited him from travelling by air as the pain in the ear could aggravate”, Saraswat said.
 
 According to the prosecution counsel  , two more applications are pending before the court of which one is pertaining to the submitting a false affidavit of missing arms in the court by Khan and another one was moved by Khan against Bora.
 
 Arguments on both these application will take place on October 4 now, while the final arguments in the   poaching case are under progress in the trial court.
