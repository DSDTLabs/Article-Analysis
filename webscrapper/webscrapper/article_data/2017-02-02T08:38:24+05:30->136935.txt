BHUBANESWAR: Chief minister   on Wednesday said the   on many counts. 

 "Not much has been done to address the adverse impact of demonetisation. Specific concerns of   specially relating to development of Koraput-Balangir-Kalahandi region, opening of bank branches in unbanked gram panchayats and development aspirations of ST/SC communities have not been addressed," Naveen said in his reaction.
 
 The chief minister, however, welcomed the Centre's decision to commemorate the bi-centenary of the 'Paika Bidroha' (rebellion) against the British East India Company' in Odisha in 1817.
 
 Welcoming the Centre's effort in bringing transparency in political funds, Naveen said the initiative would be taken forward. "We will be fully supportive of every initiative taken to bring transparency in public life," Naveen added.
 
 On Centre's decision over nation-wide implementation of the maternity benefit programme, which is a replica of state government's Mamata scheme, the   said it is indicative of the success of state's model scheme.
 
 Naveen, though, appreciated some of the steps taken for the farm sector especially in dairy processing and infrastructure development fund under Nabard. He said the interest rate on agricultural credit should be reduced to 1% as done by the state government. 
 
 He, however, expressed displeasure for not inadequate focus on creation of job for youths. Naveen said allocation of funds for schemes relating to rural roads, rural drinking water, education, mid-day-meal programme and urban development is almost stagnant.
 
 Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee president Prasad Harichandan also criticised the Centre for not allotting any special package to Odisha. "KBK development has been ignored yet again," Prasad tweeted.
