 is undoubtedly one of the best dancers   has ever witnessed. If you ever wondered who could match steps with the quick-footed Shahid, looks like we have found the perfect match. 

  
  
 We’re talking about his darling daughter Misha. On the occasion of World Dance Day, the ‘Rangoon’ actor posted a video that sees him shaking a leg. But it’s his li’l princess   who steals his thunder in the video as she too bounces along to the beat. Shahid shared the video with the caption, “#worlddanceday #havefeetwilldance #mj dance is in your blood.” Well, Misha has certainly got dance in her genes. Whether she will grow up to become a nimble dancer like her daddy dearest or not is another question. For now, we can’t stop oohing and aahing over the little one’s moves.
