BHUBANESWAR: A year since chief minister   laid the foundation stone for the second campus of the Khallikote Cluster   here, construction of the new campus is yet to begin. 

 Almost 20.20 acres of land in Palur Hill in the Kanisi tehsil was demarcated for the new campus in January of this year for the proposed campus. 
 
 University authorities have neither received Rs 55 crore sanctioned for the second campus under the Centre's   (RUSA) fund, nor the state government approved Rs 50 crore that university authorities had sought additionaly.
 
 "The government has sought several clarifications to release the RUSA funds. We have compiled these and hope to get the funds for the construction of the new campus," said university vice-chancellor,  . The 138-year-old college has 18 under-graduate and post-graduate departments with 4,500 students.
