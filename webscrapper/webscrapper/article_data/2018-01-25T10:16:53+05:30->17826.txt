PANAJI: Flanked by his family members, Special Judicial Magistrate, Mapusa, Sudin Sangodkar, in an unusual gesture by a member of the local judiciary, addressed a media gathering on Wednesday in  . Sangodkar has raised objections against the functioning of the anti-corruption branch ( ), which recently questioned Sangodkar in a case of bribery by the peon Tilu   attached to Sangodkar’s court. Sangodkar’s house was also searched.

 He said that holding a press conference ‘may go against me’ but he had no option because his parent department, which is the high court, was not helping him in any way.
 
 “From the time the incident took place on January 11 till date, I continue to be a judicial magistrate. My powers should have been withdrawn if there was a case against me. I have asked for the copy of the complaint now. But when I was called for questioning I was simply sent a call, and not a summon, which said the ACB wants to ask me a few questions pertaining to Aroskar’s case and then suddenly my residence was searched,” said Sangodkar.
 
 He claimed that as per procedure, the high court has to direct him to appear before the ACB for questioning and the ACB cannot call him directly. 
 
  “I was posted in   for most of my career. I have returned to Goa only one-and-a-half year ago. I had taken voluntary retirement. I was appointed as judicial magistrate on a contract just three months ago. How can I make money in just three months, that too under MV Act?” said Sangodkar.
