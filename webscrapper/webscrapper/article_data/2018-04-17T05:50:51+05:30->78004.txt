NEW DELHI: With revamped toilets, upgraded waiting rooms and a new colour scheme, the   is going to don a new look by the end of June. 

 As part of the first phase of its  , bright orange and blue will replace the dull white on the exteriors of the station to match the colours that are already being used for foot overbridges. Railway officials said the work is on track and most of the external changes have been completed, adding that more aesthetic changes will be made in the next two months. Paintings and street art will adorn a portion of the wall at the station entrance, stretching all the way up to the booking and enquiry counters. 
 
 “The exteriors will be changed by the end of May and the deadline for all the remaining upgradation is June. We have improved the waiting rooms and toilets and have also added more seating options. The interiors have been painted by various artists, depicting the traditions and heritage of the country,” said a senior railway official.
 
 The first phase of the renovation plan consists of immediate measures that are needed at the station, while the long-term measures— including a coach-guidance system, false ceilings with LED lights and new toilets on certain platforms—will take another 12 months to complete.
 
 Last year, railways had conducted a detailed audit of the station and found that passengers wanted better cleanliness and improved aesthetics.   to guide passengers, and more lifts and escalators are also part of the plan. “We have taken into account all facilities that passengers wanted...improvements have been made to the existing infrastructure. The entire station is getting a fresh coat of paint. We have already painted the Ajmeri Gate side, including the foot overbridges,” said the official.
