INDORE: Tension gripped   on Wednesday after some saffron activists gathered near a Hanuman temple and alleged that construction was being carried out despite a high court ban. 

 
 Under heavy   deployment, officials took stock of the situation and assured the agitators of a solution in 24 hours. “Despite a court ban on any construction at both religious sites, there has been a lot of construction in the past 15 days, including marble flooring and brass decorations. We complained to police and administration, but no action was taken,” alleged members of Hindu Jagran Manch.
 
 In a bid to mount pressure on the authorities, saffron activists gathered near Hanuman Temple in large numbers. While one group sat down to chant mantras, another group went to work with cement and bricks to start their own construction. Police from  , led by CSP B K   and SDM Bihari Singh, rushed to the spot and persuaded the agitators to disperse. 
 
 Around 3.30pm, additional forces arrived and police and administrative officials carried out a site inspection. “We have inspected the spot and will discuss the issue with the district collector. He will decide the next course of action. Saffron activists will be informed accordingly on Thursday morning,” SDM Singh told reporters.
