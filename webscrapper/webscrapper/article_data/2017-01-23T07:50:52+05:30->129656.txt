BHOPAL: In a first,   (DGRR) will outsource   for   

 Likely to commence next week, the   hospital operating from Kamla Nehru wing of Gandhi Medical college (GMC) will outsource the tests to overcome the shortage of radio diagnostic machines. “Tendering process for outsourcing tests has been completed. Three private diagnostic centres have been selected for conducting the tests at 5% or more lower than central government health scheme (CGHS) rates,” said DGRR director Dr KK Dubey. “Success of the initiative is likely to be replicated by other government hospitals, including GMC,” he added.
 
 GMC associated Hamidia Hospital has been functioning without CT-scan or MRI machines. These machines are considered mandatory for emergency care and mandatory as per Medical Council of India guidelines for a medical college. Over the years, a CT-scan machine at Kamla Nehru wing was operated by the DGRRR. However, the CT-scan machine has been out of use for years and is expected to be auctioned soon. GMC proposal to purchase MRI and CT scan machines has been pending with the directorate of medical education. DGRR proposal is based on CGHS rates. It would include MRI, CT-scan, colour Doppler and mammography diagnostics. “As per our agreement, the service provider would provide ambulance for patients. Emergency patients report would be furnished in three hours and other reports within a working day,” he added. PET-CT scan a combination of PET scan and CT scan for detection of cancer and heart diseases will cost about Rs 12,500 (40% less than CHGS rate), MRI 20% less than CGHS rate, he added.
