BENGALURU: Playing outside is no longer fun for children of   in northeast Bengaluru's Thanisandra after heavy showers on Saturday resulted in overflowing sewers and potholed roads.

 The problem, however, is not unique to Saraipalya. Overflowing manholes, uncovered shoulder drains and dug-up roads are a common sight on MG Road, Nandidurga Road, St  's Road, Kalyan Nagar flyover, Babusa Palya, Ring road,   main road among other parts of the city.
 
 “We have complained to the corporator several times but to no avail. For the past 7 to 8 years, sewage water spills on to the roads here and remains there for about a week every monsoon. Children have no place to play, vehicles have to wade through water, and autos and cabs refuse to come here,“ said R Ramesh, a resident of Thanisandra.
 
 “Most road surfaces have been completely washed away ,“ he added. “The area is yet to get proper sewers. We will raise the problems with the authorities concerned,“ said corporator Mamtha K M.
 
 Seema Kini, who commutes from Bhadrappa Layout to   daily, said, “Au thorities have cleaned the ad jacent canal but haven't cleared waste from the road side. In case of rain, it spills all over the street.“ According to residents, some roads dug up for cable laying work have not been filled up.
