SAP SE said it paid 128.6 million rand ($11 million) to companies linked to  , which is headed by three brothers accused of using their friendship with former President   to defraud state-owned entities.

 The findings represent the first time that an international company has given details on specific payments made to Gupta entities. Other global businesses to become embroiled in the corruption allegations include US consultancy McKinsey & Co. Inc., which said last year it had made “several errors of judgment” while working for state utility Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd., and KPMG LLP, which audited Gupta companies and has said the work fell below its usual standards.
 
 SAP said a probe by law firm Baker McKenzie found that the German software giant made the payments to third parties as commissions on contracts with Eskom and ports and rail operator Transnet SOC Ltd. Three senior executives who were suspended last year have now quit and the Walldorf-based company is cooperating with ongoing investigations by US and South African authorities.
 
 SAP said last year it’s being probed by the   and the US Securities and Exchange Commission over how it won contracts with South African state businesses. The Guptas, who are in business with one of Zuma’s sons, are accused of using their political connections to win contracts and influence ministerial appointments. They and the Zumas deny wrongdoing.
