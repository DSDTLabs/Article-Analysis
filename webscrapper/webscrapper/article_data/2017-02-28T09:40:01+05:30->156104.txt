 A red letter notice is a final warning to tax evaders. The notice was written in red ink that communicated the urgency of the matter. The BMC identified 192 habitual defaulters and sent them the warning. Since the day of the issue of the notice, the civic body has been able to collect Rs 2.5 crore, which will go a long way in meeting the target set for the current financial year towards holding taxes. The BMC has set a target of Rs 42 crore for the current fiscal, said an officer of BMC. So far, the urban body has collected Rs 18 crore.

There are   slabs for different holdings.
 
 On January 9, the BMC decided to take punitive action against the evaders by obtaining a special permission from the   (RDC, central division), who designated three deputy commissioners of BMC as certificate officers. The officers are empowered to seize the properties in case the defaulters don't clear the dues. 
 
 In another development, the BMC identified 219 more tax evaders, who will be slapped closure notices soon. Till now, in two phases it has identified 411 defaulters. A final list of defaulters will be prepared after the end of current financial year and punitive action will be taken against them, said an officer. 
 
 The BMC hopes the red letter notice alone will will help them generate Rs 10 crore revenue to meet the target of Rs 42 crore. The city currently has around one lakh holdings. Every year, there are 10% (10,000) defaulters.
