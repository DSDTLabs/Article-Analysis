LUCKNOW: More than 40% sanitary workers are on a long leave to celebrate  , leaving the city littered after the festival. 

 With the all-India survey of cleanliness set to begin next week, a dirty Lucknow is a concern for  . 
 
  Though   says that officially only 40% workers have taken leave till Sunday and the rest have resumed work on Saturday, uncollected waste from houses and stinking garbage heaps on roadsides present a different picture. Despite being present in records, there is prolonged absenteeism of most sanitary staff. 
 
 TOI conducted a reality check to know the cleanliness and sanitation conditions of the city after Holi and the result was disappointing. 
 
 There was a huge pile of three-day-old garbage near Rahimnagar crossing. 
 
 Tariq, a shopkeeper, said, "The ground was cleaned properly only ahead of the Investors' Summit. After that, it is just being cleaned superficially. You will always find garbage spilling on to the roads." With scattered garbage come flies, infection, stinking surroundings and cattle menace. The same was witnessed at many spots on Saturday: near sector Q crossing in Aliganj, on Janakipuram's sector J road, on   near Bhootnath Market and on Prag Narain Road, among others. 
 
 Shikha Cahturvedi of Aliganj said, "Because of the absenteeism of workers, locals have started dumping domestic garbage on main roads." 
 
 An LMC health official said, "Though most streets and dumping grounds were cleaned on Saturday, falling of leaves and dust-laden winds have littered streets further. The long leaves of workers has enhanced the problem." 
 
  Even the private company responsible for collecting garbage from houses didn't inform people of absenteeism of its collectors. Aarti from Mahanagar said, "We have a function at home and many guests have arrived. A lot of garbage is dumped near the dustbin but no one has to come to collect it for three days."
