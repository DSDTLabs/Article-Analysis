MADURAI: The case pertaining to the alleged misappropriation in the making of a panchaloha idol weighing over 220 kg at   has been transferred to the CB-CID wing from the idol wing police. The latter had registered a case on unearthing irregularities in the making of the idol of the temple’s presiding deity - Thandayuthapani – during 2003-04. 

 The director general of police issued the orders to transfer the case as it was more of misappropriation and cheating in the idol making, whereas the idol wing police were largely into investigation of smuggling of idols. The idol wing police led by inspector general A   had conducted inquiries in the alleged crime that took place during 2003-04. A team led by him had also checked various documents pertaining to the case a few days ago. 
 
 The police had arrested two people – chief sculptor   and administrative officer of the temple KK Raja. According to the police, the temple officials decided to make an idol weighing 200 kgs in 2003 and Muthiah was roped in. The idol was completed in 2004 and kept in front of the presiding deity. However, it was removed within six months since it turned dark. Since then it had been kept away in a room. 
 
 It was suspected by the police that making the new idol was part of a larger ploy to replace the old one with it and smuggle the former out of the country. Moreover, it was suspected that the accused could have swindled large quantities of gold jewellery obtained through donations throughout the country to make the idol. A test conducted by the police also revealed that all five materials which constituted panchaloha were not used to make it. Moreover, the idol was planned to be weigh 200 kgs but ended up weighing 221 kgs.
