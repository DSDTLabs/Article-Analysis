CHANDIGARH: The judgment in the J&K sex scandal case in Chandigarh district court is expected to be out by the end of May as Punjab and   High court dismissed the defence and prosecutrixâ€™s plea to allow her to record her statement again and further examine her in the case.

 Dismissing the plea, the HC said the prosecutrix cannot be recalled once her statement had already been recorded. Earlier, a special CBI court had rejected the application, following which an appeal was filed in the high court.
 
 This is one of the two cases which were transferred from Jammu and Kashmir to Chandigarh district court.
 
 Now, in her late 20s, the alleged victim had filed a petition before the Punjab and Haryana high court saying that she wanted to appear before the court and was willing to record her statement again. It was said that the woman wanted to add more points in this case.
 
 The defence and prosecution have concluded their final arguments in this case in the Chandigarh district court, but the final order was stayed after the HC put a stay on the same.
 
 The next date of hearing in this case is May 22.
 
 The scam had made headlines in 2006 after police had discovered two video CDs showing sexually exploitation of Kashmiri women. The police had questioned two girls, including the prosecutrix and the alleged kingpin. Names of 56 people, allegedly involved in the racket, had cropped up during the interrogation.
 
 The case was transferred to the CBI after names of ministers and influential men had surfaced in the case. The   then shifted the case to Chandigarh the same year.
 
 The name of then J&K chief minister   had also surfaced in the CBI chargesheet which made him quit as CM in July 2009. Later most of the accused were acquitted for lack of evidence and several witnesses turning hostile.
