What a time to be alive! Film maker Satayajit Ray’s iconic sleuth,  , is bobbing about on a camel around the concrete desert of a certain eastern metropolis. 

  On the 50th year of Satyajit Ray’s extremely popular private investigator  , aka Feluda’s first book appearance, Kolkata pays tribute to both the creator and the character with a theme park that was launched in Kolkata’s   on Friday.
 
  The park found most of its motifs from the Satyajit Ray’s first Feluda movie 
  (The Golden Fortress) based on the book of the same title. Named   (The   Park) the recreation spot is built around sculptures of the alert sleuth atop a camel in hot pursuit, a reminder of the storyline where the ace detective chases kidnappers through the dunes of Rajasthan. 
 
  At the park, Feluda is accompanied by cousin Tapesh Ranjan Mitra or Topshe who is the narrator of the stories. Ray introduces comic relief Jatayu ( ), a writer of thriller novels, in the 
  book. In the park, Jatayu can be seen perched on the camel, scared out of his wits, seated behind Feluda. Heaps of sand made to look like dunes provide the perfect backdrop.
 
  Feluda first appeared in the Bengali short story "Feludar Goyendagiri" (Feluda's Investigations) which was published in 
 , a children's periodical edited by Ray himself. In the Feluda series that followed, he was portrayed as a man of around 27 with a tall, athletic figure adept in martial arts, who relies mostly upon his superb analytical ability and observation skill. 
 
  Feluda possesses a .32 Colt revolver but rarely uses it.
