 Inspector general (Punjab Frontier) of the BSF Mukul Goyal said that at 8.15 am on Monday their patrolling party spotted a person entering the Indian territory from a place near the Simbal border outpost, taking advantage of a thick layer of fog. Initially, he was warned by the BSF troops. Ignoring the warnings, the intruder entered the Indian territory, following which the BSF opened fire and he was shot dead.
 
 Following the killing, the BSF held a flag meeting with Pak Rangers and gave the photograph of the intruder, who was believed to be in early twenties. But the Rangers declined to identify the intruder and even refused to take the body, which was later handed over to police. The BSF didnâ€™t find anything objectionable from the intruder, whose body has been sent for a postmortem examination.
 
 Interestingly, Pak terrorists who had struck at Dinanagar police station in 2015 and Pathankot Air Force base in 2016 had reportedly entered India through the Bamiyal sector.
