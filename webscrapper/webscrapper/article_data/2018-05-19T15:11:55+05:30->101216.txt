TIRUNELVELI: ‘Maiam Whistle’ app is not just another mobile application but a wonderful tool as well as a weapon to be used for the good of the nation, actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan has said. The app was a chisel that should be used responsibly and with pride to shape   by getting their grievances redressed.

 Kamal emphasised on using the party’s app at all the places where he spoke on the third and last day of his three-day tour of the southern districts on Friday, when he travelled to many places in Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar districts. “I did not start the party. You made me start the party,” he told the gathering in Tirunelveli.
 
 Noticing many people gathered around his vehicle taking his pictures and recording videos, he asked how many of them had the Maiam Whistle app. “It is an app for members of the party. Those who have it and know how to use it should teach others to use it. You should use it to inform us (grievances and needs),” he said.
 
 As in the previous two days of his tour, Kamal made his speech short at many places on Friday too, much to the disappointment of the fans and public who thronged hear him speak. The longest time he spent at a place was close to six minutes in Tirunelveli town when people asked him to go on when he wrapped up his speech in less than three minutes. “People are asking me to talk. I don’t have a prepared speech,” he said and added that the words he uttered were coming from his heart. “I realise that I have responsibility of giving back to you as an Indian and Tamilian,” he said. At another place he said he had come here earlier as an actor but now as someone to serve the people.
 
 Starting his final day’s schedule at  , he also spoke at Melapalayam before addressing people at Tirunelveli town. He also spoke at Alangulam, Pavoorchatram, Puliyangudi, Tenkasi and   in Tirunelveli district before heading to Rajapalayam in Virudhunagar district.
