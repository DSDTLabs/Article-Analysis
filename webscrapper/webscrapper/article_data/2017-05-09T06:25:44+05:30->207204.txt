GUWAHATI: For 16 years, the results of the Class X board examinations in the state have been manipulated by   in an attempt to present a "misleading" picture of improvement in the  , education minister   said in the House on Monday. 

  "Yesterday (Sunday), the Secondary Education Board of Assam (Seba) chairman asked me what pass percentage the board should declare this time ... I asked what he meant. He said that last time the pass percentage was 61% and asked what it should be this time. He said this process has been followed for years," Sarma said. 
 
  Making the "revelation" during Zero Hour, Sarma said the pass percentage in the Class X board conducted by Seba has always been below 30%. However, that figure has been jacked up by at least 40% by revising marksheets under instructions from the government. 
 
  Sarma, who was education minister in the previous Congress government as well, said, "I had also been an education minister, but only for two years. When I came to know about this, I quit," Sarma said, indirectly referring to his dissidence against the then chief minister, Tarun Gogoi.
