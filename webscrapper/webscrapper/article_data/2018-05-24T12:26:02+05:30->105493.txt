CHENNAI: Three months after   set out to test the nutrition of food provided under the midday meal scheme, the department's report indicates they have bitten off more than they can chew. 

 
 Since January, designated food safety officers have collected 140 samples from schools in six districts, including Chennai, and sent them for analysis to the government food testing labs. However, their final reports have little on the nutritional value of these samples, instead it clears them of having any dangerous microbiological content.
 
  
 When food safety commissioner P Amudha sought an explanation from officers, they cited shortage of manpower and equipment in the six government labs approved by the  . At least 80% of the positions in these facilities lie vacant. 
 
 Tamil Nadu's food laboratories were among 65 such units across the country that were rapped by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India for not possessing accreditation from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL).
 
 Officials say each lab receives anywhere between 400 and 600 samples for testing a month. "We do have a shortage of hands in our labs," acknowledged Amudha, who is in the process of compiling a report on the deficiencies in these labs. Samples of cooked food from midday meal centres have to be delivered to the labs within two hours to check for nutrition. "We had issues coordinating with the school heads. This will be addressed soon," said Amudha. 
 
 Officials are also mulling outsourcing the samples to private NABL accredited labs. 
 
 TN's upgraded version of the meal programme, the Midday Nutritious Meal Scheme, which then chief minister M G Ramachandran launched in 1982, today covers more than 48 lakh children across the state. The state has a total of 43,143 noon meal centres.
