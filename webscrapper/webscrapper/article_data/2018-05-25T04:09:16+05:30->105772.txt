MUMBAI: Bombay high court on Thursday denied interim relief to Maria   in her plea for pre-arrest bail in a cheating case worth about 3 crore. Susairaj, a former model and actor, had been arrested in 2008 in the   murder case and was convicted in 2011 for playing a role in the destruction of evidence. 

 Susairaj moved the high court this week to prevent arrest in connection with a case filed by   police station, Thane, for offences punishable under sections 420 (cheating), 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 465 (forgery) criminal breach of trust and other offences on April 9. 
 
 The anti-extortion cell, crime branch (Thane), is investigating the case. Her lawyer Naveen, Chomal, sought relief as she has "not an iota of concern in the case and has only been dragged through a concocted story to rope in more people associated with main accused,  ".
 
 A   businessman had filed a complaint that he was duped of Rs 2.9 crore by the gang in September 2015. The accused promised him a 30 crore bank loan, he said. 
 
 She said that "over a decade back she also worked as a model and was an aspiring actress in the film industry, because of which she has come into limelight and is very well-known to the media". She claimed that she had "never done any business in her life and has no inclination to either''. 
 
 The vacation bench said no relief would be granted unless she deposited Rs 1 crore, which Chomal said was not possible. A regular bench will hear the matter when the court reopens.
