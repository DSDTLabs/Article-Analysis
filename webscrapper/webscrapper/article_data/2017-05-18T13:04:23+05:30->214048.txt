WASHINGTON: As President   prepares for his first overseas trip,   has announced to make a whopping $200 billion investment in the US and intends to purchase arms worth $300 billion from America, a senior administration official has said.

 Saudi Arabia will be the first stop of Trump's maiden overseas trip beginning later this week.
 
 In Saudi Arabia, Trump would address a gathering of Muslim leaders on Sunday.
 
 Leaders of more than 50 mostly-Muslim countries, including   and Pakistan from India's neighbourhood, are scheduled to attend the meeting convened by Saudi Arabia over the weekend.
 
 After Saudi Arabia, he travels to Israel and follow it with a visit to Italy, where he will have an audience with Pope Francis at the Vatican.

 "Saudis would be signing for making $200 billion of investment in the United States which would create a lot of jobs," said a senior administration official involved in planning of the major presidential trip on Wednesday.
 
 "They (Saudis) see America a place to invest their money for all the reasons. They see our economy really about to take off. They see great rule of law. They see great opportunity here. So they want to invest in US a lot which is good for us to create jobs," the official said.
 
 "They (Saudi Arabia) also intend to purchase about $300 billion of military equipment. They would be signing agreements for about USD 109 billion, which is all dollar for dollar stuff which American would have to buy alone if we were to go alone to keep the region safe," the official said.
