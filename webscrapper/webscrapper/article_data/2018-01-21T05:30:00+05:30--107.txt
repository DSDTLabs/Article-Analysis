Mysuru: Barely two months after JD(S) legislator S Chikkamadu’s death, his family has expressed desire of joining the Congress party.

 Their decision is a fallout of recent developments in the JD(S) for which   untiringly worked for nearly 15 years. Sources claimed Chikkamadu’s family has been sidelined after Chikkanna joined the party recently.
 
 Initially, party leaders including H D Kumaraswamy had promised to support Chikkamadu’s son Anil saying he will be given an opportunity in the ensuing assembly election, but JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda is backing Chikkanna. Anil, a member in Mysuru Zilla Panchyat, was asked to work under Chikkanna, which has saddened Chikkamadu’s family, sources said.
 
 Following the development, Anil is said to have met chief minister Siddaramaiah at his residence in Bengaluru recently. The chief minister has asked him to come with an opinion of the taluk leaders and later he would decide over it. Chamarajanagar MP Dhruvanarayan, too, is in touch with Chikkamadu’s family members.
 
 Will contest as independent: JD(S) rebel
 
 Mysuru: JD(S) rebel K Harish Gowda on Saturday said he will be contesting the assembly election as an independent candidate from Chamaraja constituency if he doesn’t get ticket from any of the parties. 
 
 Gowda, however, said that senior leaders from the Congress, BJP and even from JD(S) have approached him and he has kept his options open.
 
 The former JD(S) city unit president is yet to get an official communication from the party top brass about his expulsion.
