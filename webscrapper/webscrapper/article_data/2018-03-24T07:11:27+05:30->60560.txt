NEW DELHI: The   has come out with amendments in rules to ensure better management of   and bio-medical waste through revised targets and monitoring under the Central Pollution Control Board.

 
 The amended e-waste (management) rules, notified by the environment ministry on Thursday, made it mandatory for the ‘Producer Responsibility Organisations’ (PROs) to register themselves with the CPCB — a move which will help it to keep a watch on them.
 
 Under the rule, it is the responsibility of electronic goods manufacturers to collect and channel e-waste from consumers to authorised dismantlers and recyclers.
