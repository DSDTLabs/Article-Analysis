  On that note 'strap' is often referred to a gun.
 
  The report further mentioned, according to the rapper's representative, "Months ago, Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson filed to trademark the phrase 'Get The Strap,' a slogan he has been posting across all of his social media platforms. It is posted in connection with photographs and videos, including many featuring just him or things he is promoting."
 
  The statement continued, "Taken in its proper context, the specific post in question was neither intended as, nor could reasonably be interpreted as a threat or call to violence against anyone. So the record is clear, Mr. Jackson does not condone or promote the use of violence against anyone.? 'Get The Strap' is a playful phrase used by Mr. Jackson to punctuate absurd and outrageous situations."
