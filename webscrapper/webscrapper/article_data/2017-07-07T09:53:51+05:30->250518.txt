MUMBAI: A 65-year-old   driver fell victim to a fraudster who siphoned off Rs 49,000 while pretending to help him deposit the amount in an   with   deposit facility on Wednesday. The incident occurred when the victim stopped at the unmanned ATM of a nationalized bank near Mithibai Junction in Vile Parle to deposit money into his son’s account for his college fees. Juhu police have sought the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage to identify the accused.

 The incident occurred around 11.30am after the victim, Mira Road’s Girish Koli, found the ATM. In his complaint, Koli said, “I was inside the ATM kiosk when a man stepped in. I was wondering how to deposit the money when the man said he knew the method and took the money from my hand. I gave him my son’s account number.”
 
 Minutes after the money was deposited, Koli called his son and checked whether he had received the money. When money is deposited in a cash deposit ATM, the deposit is immediately reflected in the creditor’s account. 
 
 Koli lodged a complaint after his son’s account did not reflect the deposit even after three hours. “The unknown person seems to have deposited the money into his own account. We have sought details from the bank regarding the account where was deposited,” said the investigators.
 
 Juhu police senior inspector Sunil Ghosalkar confirmed the incident. “The victim had gone to deposit the money when the accused followed him and   him,” said Ghosalkar. A case of cheating has been registered against the unidentified man.
