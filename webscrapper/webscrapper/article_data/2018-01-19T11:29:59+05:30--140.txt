HYDERABAD: Justice B   of the   has directed   Crime Investigation Department (CID) additional director-general to conduct a full-fledged investigation into a complaint filed against R J  , a trustee of Puttaparthy   Trust in   district.

 A petition was filed in the high court by Ganapathy Raju, a relative of Satya Sai Baba, charging Ratnakar with misusing trust funds and assets and foisting false cases against him because he was informing his misdeeds to other trustees. Raju, in his plea, said Ratnakar had created a fake email in his name and sent it to trust officials seeking ₹25 lakh. A complaint was filed with the Hyderabad cyber police too, which referred the plaint back to Puttaparthy police, who were reportedly hand-in-glove with Ratnakar, he claimed.
 
 Raju also alleged Ratnakar was upset with him ever since he foiled his attempt to hand over Satya Sai Airport to a private company. “Ratnakar got a false atrocity case registered against me,” Raju said in his plea. The judge, however, refused to quash the atrocity case against Raju. “Since you are saying it is a false case, you can go to the trial court and brief it about the same,” the judge told Ganapathy Raju. Regarding the complaint against Ratnakar, the judge directed additional DG of CID to call for records from the local police.
