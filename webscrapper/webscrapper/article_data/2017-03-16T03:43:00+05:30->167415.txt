Established way back in the year 1932,  , situated in the heart of Margao, is named after its founder, the late Anta Raikar. Now, four generations on, it is managed by Aditya and his wife, Prajita Raikar, who have managed to retain the goodwill generated by their forefathers, Babairao and Gajanan.

 Explaining his fascination for the trade, Aditya says he would watch his father, Gajanan, work at the store, crafting fine, jewelled items. So, when the lad graduated in 1998, he knew exactly what he wanted to do—carry forward the family business. 
 
 Following his formal entry into Anta Jewellers, Aditya took it upon himself to carry out some much desired renovation work and upgrade the ambience to keep the small, box-like shop relevant to the present era.
 
 Aditya, who has two sons of his own, Aarnav, 11, and Ayaan, 7, is proud of the mark the family business has made in the state’s commercial capital. “Anta Jewellers deals with gold, silver, diamond and platinum jewellery, though the latter is on order basis. We also sell Hallmark 916 grade jewellery and branded diamond ornaments,” he says, adding, “Nevetheless, as there still exists a demand among Goan clients for our fine filigree work on jewellery, we have limited our array of personalized designs as we now offer a slew of imported designs.”
 
 While Aditya believes that Anta Jewellers’ unique selling proposition is the price, quality and innovative designs of its ornaments, Prajita adds that after-sales services and customized jewellery items are also factors that draws clientele from all walks of life to the store. 
 
 “Previously, customers could choose only from two or three patterns of jewellery. Now, we provide a variety of designs,” she says.
 
 The couple has also broadened the reach of the business by tying up with an annually-held beauty pageant as an associate sponsor.
