BHUBANESWAR: The state government has decided to start the admission process in junior colleges for Plus II courses from the third week of May, almost a month after the declaration of the Class X state board exam results. 

 Parents and students are not happy with the delay and allege that this can lead to loss of valuable time especially when compared to other boards' schools which have already started classes for Class XI.
 
 "The centralised admission process for all junior colleges in the state will begin around the third week of May as results of other boards like the   and ICSE are yet to be announced," said nodal officer for college admissions, Mihir Das. 
 
 Most students who pass their Class X examinations from schools affiliated to the   (BSE) face difficulties in the plus two or college level as the medium of instruction changes from Odia to English. " This is the reason for which a large number of students who do well in the school level topple in colleges. If the summer vacation can be used by the colleges to prepare students with bridge courses, it would be of great help to them," said  , director of the  , a private Plus II science college. 
 
 Unlike schools affiliated to CBSE or ICSE boards, classes in colleges begin in the last week of June. "Obviously we will lag behind them and it will also affect our performance in Plus II," said  , who has graduated Class X.
 
 The state government may also have decided to conduct board examinations in the first year of Plus II, according to sources. "A couple of months after admission there will be a puja vacation, a month later there will be winter vacation. Can the course be completed by March for the board exam?" asked  , a high school teacher whose son passed Class X this year.
