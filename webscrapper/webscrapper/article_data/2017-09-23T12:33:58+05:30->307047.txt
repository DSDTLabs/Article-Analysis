CHANDIGARH: Granting relief to a large number of candidates selected as constables in Haryana Police under the economically backward person (EBP) category, the Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday permitted them to join the training academy.

 A division bench headed by Justice  , however, made it clear that their appointment shall remain subject to the outcome of the final decision of the   on the issue.
 
 As many as 500 candidates were selected as constables in June 2017 under the EBP category. While several of them had joined the police training academy, some were restrained from joining by the state government in view of HC’s July 5 orders.
 
 “Reservation as per notification issued on September 27, 2013 be not given effect to in the selection process initiated pursuant to the advertisement issued on July 19, 2015”, the HC had ordered. The orders were passed on a plea that such reservation was given against the constitutional provisions.
 
 Aggrieved from these orders, around 30 candidates had approached the HC through senior advocate Girish Agnihotri and Bhuvan Vats, seeking vacation of stay.
 
 Agnihotri had argued that the selection process under the EBP category was challenged and relief of stay was declined by the HC, therefore, the selection process based on the EBP quota was continuing unabated. It was also stated that these candidates cannot be restrained from joining because similarly situated candidates had already join the academy.
 
 Responding to their pleas, the Haryana government had consented that they can be permitted to join subject to the final outcome of the petition.
 
 The matter had reached before the HC in wake of a petition filed by  , a resident of   district and four others.
