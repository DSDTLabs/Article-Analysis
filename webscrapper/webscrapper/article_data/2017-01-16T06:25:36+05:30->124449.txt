 Earlier, US firm   had raised their reservations when the state government was about to finalise the purchase of  .
 
 “Both the manufacturers were called to present their case by the GAD but none of them came. So the government will take the process further. Now the most plausible action is to call open tenders once again,” said an official from the empowered committee.
 
 Officials though claim that that their process was transparent and claims by Bell and Airbus were based on unfounded reasons. The two manufacturers alleged that the state government floated a tender on November 21 for a helicopter for chief minister   that made only particular company qualified.
 
 The tender allegedly specified that the government only wants AgustaWestland’s AW169 helicopter, therefore, making AgustaWestland the only company that qualified to supply the helicopter. The deal is estimated to be worth over Rs 50 crore. In its fresh bidding, it is expected that government will put a condition of buying back its grounded state chopper which is estimated at Rs 13 crore.
