Panaji: A ferry on the Cortalim-Madkai route broke down twice on Tuesday merely days after its counterpart was towed away for major engine repairs. The Cortalim-Madkai route has only two ferries designated to it. One of them, ‘Harvalem’ had gone for major engine repairs last week to the river navigation department’s (RND) Betim workshop. An extra ferry from the RND’s fleet was then deployed on this route. This replacement ferry, ‘Mandovi’ had been operating since; but broke down due to gear box failure at around 11am on Tuesday. The burden of ferrying passengers across the waterbody was, therefore, on a single ferry, ‘Penha da Franca’. With an average footfall of 1,000 people per day, the single ferry managed to operate through the day till the ‘Mandovi’ returned later in the evening. Ferry commute through this route, therefore, resumed for a brief period. The ‘Mandovi’, however, broke down for the second time due to problems in its engine. It was then sent to the RND workshop at Betim for repairs. The ferry ‘Tiswadi’ is expected to replace it on Wednesday. Sources from RND attributed the reason for the failure of the ferry to operational problems, which are common during heavy rainfall. “Ferries operate non-stop for 16-18 hours per day. There is added stress on the mechanical make-up due to heavy rainfall. The breakdown was as a result of this. These are operational problems that we are constantly trying to resolve,” an RND official said. Sources also informed TOI that the RND is in the process of acquiring new ferries. RND has floated a tender for three new ferries which are expected to hit the river routes by December this year. Three old ferries have already been condemned and sent for scrapping. RND is also contemplating bringing in two more ferries in this financial year.
