Panaji: Of the close to 70 new private primary schools that have opened across Goa since 2012, the state government has allowed three to operate from the buildings of government primary schools which have shut down in the respective areas.

 Government records show that Shanta Vidyalaya of Sodiem in Siolim has been allotted the vacant building of the Government Primary School Aframent in the locality, which had shut down. Similarly, Sunandabai Bandodkar High School of Salvador Do Mundo is operating from the government primary school building at Salvador Do Mundo.
 
 Prabodhan Prathamik Vidyalaya of Pomburpa has been allowed to run from the premises of the shut down Pomburpa government primary school.
 
 The number of government primary schools with less than 15 students has been steadily increasing over the last few years. This eventually forces many such schools to shut down.
 
 The directorate of education (DoE) is struggling to maintain vacant buildings of several government primary schools that have shut down over the years. Some have shut down as early as the 90s, leading some in areas like Sattari to come crumbling down.
 
 There is increasing pressure on the DoE from sports clubs, private gymnasiums, NGOs, etc to lend the vacant buildings to them to run their operations from. 
 
 It is a two-edged sword for the DoE as it either hands over the vacant buildings to private clubs or faces the burden of maintaining these properties. In these circumstances, handing over the building to schools to run educational activities emerges as the better option.
 
 But, in two cases, the state has handed vacant   buildings to private bodies. Lions Club of Assagao operates from government primary school building at Bhairo, Alto-Assagao, and government primary school in Saligao has been handed over in part to the post office and part to the club Adarsha Yuvak Sangh of Saligao, according to DoEâ€™s records.
