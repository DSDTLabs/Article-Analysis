CHENNAI: MLAs across parties wanted the government to permit them to use the   in front of their vehicles as they need not stop at toll gates. The issue was raised by deputy leader of opposition S   when chief minister   was present in the house. 

 “The government must allow all MLAs to use the   in front of their vehicles. It will enable us to just tell the toll gate personnel and cross it. Now it is difficult for us to tell them about our identity and then cross the toll gate. I request the chief minister to make an announcement on this,” said Duraimurugan. 
 
 Soon after Duraimurugan said this, legislators from the DMK, the AIADMK and Congress tapped their benches in approval. This enthused the DMK veteran. 
 
 Soon after this, the chief minister started consulting senior ministers on the issue. “The toll gates are coming under the Centre and we will definitely take the issue to the Centre and find a solution,” said Palaniswami.
