PATNA: The JD (U) has decided to oppose the Centre’s   ( ) proposal. Chief minister and JD (U) boss   said on Tuesday said a formal letter in this regard would be sent to the Centre on Wednesday. 

 Centre has sought suggestions from various stakeholders, including all state governments and political parties on UCC, which is a part of the directive principles of the Constitution of India.
 
 “The way central government has proposed UCC is wrong. India has a plural society as people of various communities and religions live together. As all segments of the society have been following their own religious and traditional norms from the very beginning, it is essential that detailed feedback is taken from each community before coming up with any uniform law; otherwise the plural structure of our society would be in danger,” said Nitish.
 
 The feedback on the UCC has been sought through a questionnaire prepared by Law Commission of India, which is available on its website (lawcommissionofindia.nic.in). The Nitish government has already refused to reply to the questionnaire through a decision taken by the state cabinet on January 10.
 
 Taking a dig at the feedback-seeking exercise through questionnaire, Nitish said, “Is this the way to seek feedback from state governments on sensitive issues like UCC? Are we giving any exam or seeking job that we have to answer on a question paper?”
 
 Nitish added that a decision to oppose the proposed UCC was taken at the meeting of the core committee of the JD (U) on Monday. “Bihar was the first state to reject replying to the questionnaire on UCC. We are of the view that the Centre should give specific proposals for different sections of the society and detailed deliberations should be held on different aspects before seeking any final feedback,” said Nitish.
