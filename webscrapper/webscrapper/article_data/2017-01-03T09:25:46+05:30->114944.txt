KOLHAPUR: The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation ( ) has finally made its first move towards cashless transactions at its bus stands. 

 The state transport utility has decided to install Point Of Sale ( ) machines at its major reservation centres across the state in a week, which could push the digital transactions and reduce the burden on the employees.
 
 The state government has directed all its departments to adopt cashless mode of transactions. To take the move forward, the transport corporation has decided to make available PoS machines in its reservation centres. 
 
 Though the MSRTC bus booking can be done online through its website through digital payments and Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), the facilities of cashless payments were missing from the reservation centres.
 
 Ranjit Singh Deol, vice chairman and managing director of MSRTC, said the corporation has decided to make PoS machines available on its reservation centres on the bus stands. 
 
 “In the first phase, we are in the process to procure 72 such machines from the  . These machines will be put up at major depots in state. Eventually, we will deploy more machines as per the demand of divisions. The PoS machines will be deployed within a week in Kolhapur,” he said. 
 
 Divisional MSRTC controller (Kolhapur)   said it was a good decision to deploy the PoS machines at the reservations centres. “It is not possible in rural depots of the district, where people prefer cash. It can be deployed at the high turnover depots like Central Bus Stand ( ) Kolhapur, Sambhajinagar, Rankala, Kagal, Ichalkaranji. It will help the people on long routes. Even it will reduce the burden upon the staff.”
 
 Abhay Kadam, who is in-charge of the CBS, said that it is one of the busiest reservation centres in the district. “The daily earning of the depot is between Rs 11 to 14 lakh. The PoS machine will be helpful on long routes. Even monthly and temporary pass holders will benefit with it,” he said.
