Thanjavur: Alleging the Central government of trampling over state autonomy, MDMK chief   called for a conference to protect the federal system in India, here on Friday. 

 “The Union government is crushing the autonomy of states. We will hold a conference in Chennai on November 20 to protect the federal system of the states, secularism and Dravidian principles,” said Vaiko, speaking at the state conference in Thanjavur on Friday during the birth anniversary of C N Annadurai. 
 
 He also said that he will invite leaders from all the states for the meeting. 
 
 MDMK passed several resolutions at the conference, including taking forward fundamental aims - social justice, linguistic, race, protection of traditional rights, secularism and state autonomy of the Dravidian movement and also to spoil the attempts by the Hindutva forces to become strong in Tamil Nadu.
 
 One of the resolutions warned of unprecedented protests by the party in the event of the Central government failing to get the consent of the president for the bill passed in Tamil Nadu assembly to exempt Tamil Nadu from NEET. 
 
 Resolution were also passed to make education a state subject apart from formation of Cauvery management board as well as Cauvery regulatory committee. 
 
 The party also insisted on the withdrawal of the decision of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi to permit the exploration of methane, hydrocarbon and shale gas in the Cauvery delta areas. 
 
 MDMK also demanded to disband NITI Aayog as the functioning of the body was inimical to the interest of the state government and instead form a new one which works in tandem with the state government in terms of financial allocation and schemes. 
 
 A resolution also demanded to release May 17 movement founder Thirumurugan Gandhi who was detained under Goondas Act for holding a protest in memory of Eelam Tamils killed in Mullivaaikkal in Sri Lanka, besides insisting on the release of students arrested for protesting against NEET.
