BENGALURU: Is the city heading into its second consecutive ruthless summer? This   is likely to come through, given the mercury spiral in the past few days, forcing Bengalureans to go shopping for sunblock creams and caps to blunt the sizzle.

 According to a bulletin issued by the Met department, the maximum   on Sunday was 35 degrees Celsius.
 
 While citizens might be feeling the heat, experts say this is the normal temperature for this time of year.
 
 “Over the next 2-4 days, the temperature will rise to a maximum of 36-37 degrees Celsius. When this happens, it will rain again. And this cycle will continue till the end of May,“ said MB Raje Gowda, a professor of agro meteorology,  .
 
 The highest temperature recorded for March was 37.3 degrees Celsius in 1996; it was 36.3 degrees Celsius in 2016. Bengaluru recorded its highest temperature on April 24, 2016, at 39.2 degrees Celsius, beating the previous high of 38.9 degrees Celsius recorded on May 22, 1931. The previous highest temperature for April was 38.3 degrees Celsius, recorded on April 30, 1931.
 
 “The impact of the heat might be felt more due to the largely clear skies during the day, with the temperature reaching its maximum between 2pm and 3pm, and cloud formation taking place after 3pm,“ weatherman Raje Gowda said.
