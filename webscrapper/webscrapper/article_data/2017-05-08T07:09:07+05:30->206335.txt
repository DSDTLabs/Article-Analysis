BENGALURU: Bellandur Lake, it appears, is never out of the news. On Sunday, a fire was reported from the banks of the lake in southeast Bengaluru. 

 According to  , additional chief secretary, who visited the waterbody, it was an accidental fire caused by people cutting dry grass at the spot.
 
 "When I reached the lakebed around 4.30pm, there was some smoke, but barely any evidence of a fire. The flames spread over a tiny patch -- 50ft x100ft -- of the massive 900-acre lake. I spoke to people and it appears the fire might have resulted from a stray cigarette or a beedi butt. It was not intentional nor related to the lake's pollution," he said.
 
 The incident took place on the edge of the lake bordering the BWSSB sewage treatment plant and Belur-Nagasandra Road. Seema, a resident who lives on the opposite side of the lake, said the fire may have started out small but the flames soon spread. "The fire started around 12.30pm and we all saw it; it lasted for 2-3 hours. However, once the flames starting growing, we decided to inform the authorities. We had hoped such incidents wouldn't occur after the   order. On February 16 too, a portion of the lakebed caught fire. We are concerned about the lake," she said. 
 
 Sarfaraz Khan, joint commissioner, health and SWM, BBMP, said the civic agency would, on Monday, meet farmers and grass-cutters working in the area to discuss the effects of such activities.
