VIJAYAWADA: The   and TDP crossed swords yet again after the   results started trickling in on Tuesday. In the morning, when it appeared that BJP would attain simple majority, its national secretary incharge of AP tweeted: “Our southward march has begun.”

 Hitting out at   in his tweet,   said: “In Karnataka, Chandrababu Naidu used all his tactics to dissuade Telugu voters from supporting BJP. But in   where most Telugus live, BJP has increased its tally from 6 to 20+. People have rejected CBN’s politics.”
 
 By the afternoon, TDP hit back with its leaders stating that no leader from its party had campaigned in Karnataka. Naidu had only appealed to the Telugus living in that state not to vote for those parties that are ‘anti-AP’. In response to Madhav’s claim, TDP put out its own figures to claim that it was   that had done very well in that region.
