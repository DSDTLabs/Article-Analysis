HYDERABAD: The timely intervention of two cops saved the life of a 28-year-old woman who jumped into Hussainsagar to commit suicide on Friday morning.

 The rescued woman is a postgraduate student from Godavarikhani. She was in love with 29-year-old   hailing from the same place. Abhilash has been working at a private firm in Secunderabad. Recently differences cropped up between them and they decided to end their relationship.
 
 Meanwhile, the woman’s family fixed her marriage with another man. On Thursday, she came to Hyderabad to meet Abhilash. She stayed in a hostel for the night and on Friday morning they came to Tank Bund to discuss their future plans.
 
 During the discussion, she got upset and jumped into the lake.  , a   constable who was on a morning walk, noticed the woman and jumped into the lake to rescue her.
 
 “I saw people raising an alarm about the woman jumping into water and since I know swimming, I also jumped into the lake. She was resisting my attempts to pull her out. Soon I got support from another person and both of us pulled her out of the water,” Yadagiri said.
 
 The other person who jumped into the water and helped Yadagiri in rescuing the woman was a NDRF head constable Janaiah. “I was on my way to office and saw people gathered on Tank Bund. I stopped and noticed that a man was struggling to rescue a woman. I got into the water and pulled her out with his support,”   said.
 
 The woman and Abhilash were sent to   for counselling. In 2018, Lake police rescued 24 people.
