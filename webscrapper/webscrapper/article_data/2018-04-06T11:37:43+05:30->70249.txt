LUCKNOW: Dalit icon BR Ambedkar’s grandson,  , said on Thursday that all political parties, including BSP, had failed Dalits who had ‘grown up’ in the last 70 years and would no longer like to remain a vote bank.

 Prakash, who is in city for ‘Save the Constitution’ rally, said that Dalits, including the most backwards, are seeking participatory space even now, and would go along with any party that promised them that.
 
 
 In light of the recent surge in Dalit appeasement by parties, especially in UP, Ambedkar said, “The most backwards are especially craving for participatory space and will go with any party which gives them that space. However, no party at present will offer that. Congress and BJP are upper class parties and how much could they possibly change. Can BJP give them space in Parliament? BSP has always used them for votes so they don’t look at it as an option. One must keep an eye on SP now to see how it moulds itself,” he said.
 
 He said that young leaders like Jignesh Mevani and   succeeded because Dalits felt that they would provide them participatory space but that won’t be possible till they function as individuals. “We would like to see them develop as organisations, not as individuals. But we don’t see them building an organization,” he said.
 
 A two-time MP, Prakash said that in next elections at least 44 Lok Sabha seats would be decided by how Dalits and Muslims vote, a clear reason behind the rush by all parties to fete  .
 
 He opposed UP government’s move to change Baba Saheb’s name. “He may have signed his name as   in the Constitution but Ramji was his father’s name and I am against its official use,” he said.
