AHMEDABAD: The permanently burning toxic Pirana dump mound, spewing venom into city’s air for more than a decade now, will finally see some action to arrest one of the city’s worst  . With the high court seeking urgent action to halt the continuing environmental damage, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation ( ) has turned to biomining.

 The method was successfully implemented by   municipality in Tamil Nadu (TN) recently. It uses a bio-culture, a solution containing a host of friendly bacteria, to first reduce the size of garbage mounds and then segregate the waste. Not only has this 150-year-old TN municipality reclaimed the dumpsite land, but the agency engaged had also claimed that almost all the waste could be recycled. On December 26, 2016, the AMC brought out a proposal inviting agencies to implement biomining or other cost-effective processes at Pirana.
 
 In biomining, the waste mound is loosened using JCBs. Large waste items are manually removed. Into the loosened mound is the sprayed the composting bio-culture, which are organized into wind rows that are few meters high with enough space for air. These small mounds are turned over every week. Over time, the volume of waste falls by up to 45%. The product after several weeks is called ‘bio-earth’. It is used for controlling methane-fueled fires at dump sites.
