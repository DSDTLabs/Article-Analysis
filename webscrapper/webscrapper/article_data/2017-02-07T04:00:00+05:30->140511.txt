Mumbai: Justice S J Kathawala of the Bombay high court on Monday adjourned to March 7 the hearing of a plea filed by a few minority non-promoter shareholders of three   companies to restrain the promoters from voting to remove independent directors. 

 Navroz Seervai, counsel for the petitioners Janak Mathuradas and three others, had moved a plea against the extraordinary general meetings (EGMs) at Tata Chemicals, Tata Motors and Tata Steel that had sought removal of industrialist Nusli Wadia as their independent director.
 
 Janak Dwarkadas, counsel for Wadia in the high court and   in the National Company Law Tribunal ( ), said it is now likely that the main petition before the tribunal will be amended to challenge Mistryâ€™s removal as director of   as being yet another act of oppression.
 
 The HC had passed an interim order to provide for one vacant seat on the boards, subject to the outcome of the petition. Zal Andhyarujina, counsel for  , said two other minority shareholders who had moved the NCLT and its appellate body too had got no relief to prevent an EGM at Tata Sons that was held on Monday for removal of Mistry as its director. 
 
 Prateek Seksaria, another counsel from the Tata camp, said he needed time to respond to an affidavit filed in reply by Wadia, which was received a couple of days ago. The reply was a detailed account of all his representation to the company, shareholders, Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and the ministry of corporate affairs, pointing out that in two of the three companies, non-promoter votes were against the resolution to remove him as director. Seervai said that only in Tata Chemicals were even the non-promoters in favour of his removal.
 
 While the game went to Tata Sons on Monday, the Mistry camp is still not out of reckoning as its petition before the tribunal alleging mismanagement and oppression of minority shareholders has yet to be heard on merits and decided, the next hearing of which is on February 13.
