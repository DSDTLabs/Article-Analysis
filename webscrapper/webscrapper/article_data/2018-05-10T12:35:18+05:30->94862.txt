SURAT: The development on the side of Adajan-Pal essentially has taken place thanks to Sardar Bridge. Once cable-stayed   and   bridge are ready along with the portion of Sardar Bridge undergoing expansion, the development is expected to pick up on Pal-Bhata area of the city too. 

 
 The landscape of Surat changed once Sardar Bridge was thrown open in 1992. It joined   with Adajan and opened up a new area of Adajan for human habitation. Around five lakh people came from congested localities and settled in this new area of Surat. 
 
 Many areas of Adajan were inundated during the floods of 2006 and people got gripped by self doubt, but things have now stabilized. 
 
 Professor  , a faculty member of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, said: “With more and more bridges coming up and people getting better accessibility to workplace, drive towards Pal will increase. Internal mobility of population will be visible after a few years of these new bridges becoming operational.” 
 
 At present, people tend to prefer houses in Vesu, Piplod, Gaurav Path and City Light localities. However, the preference of people is bound to change once cable-stayed bridge and Umra-Pal bridge are inaugurated in the next few months.
 
 Currently, the population in new areas of Adajan, Palanpur Patiya and Pal is approximately five lakh. There can be an explosion in the population in these areas, thanks to internal migration, experts said.
