INDORE: Following   records being tampered with, Gwalior-based   has started working on sending   to owners in case changes are made in their land records.

 “Ever since we started computerising the revenue records of land in the middle of 2016, cases of records being tampered with have come down drastically. With the new SMS service, the owner as well as officials concerned will get information about changes in land records allowing them to immediately report any fraud,” MP Land Records Commissioner, MK Agrawal told TOI.
 
 Agrawal added over 90 percent of scanning and digitalization-related work of a total of 4.5 crore revenue records of land has been completed. Aadhar cards and mobile numbers of   will also be linked to keep them updated with any changes via SMS.
 
 “The entire process may take 6 to 8 months” Agrawal said.
 
 He added that the department is set to launch a mobile application soon which will allow farmers to access their land records through smartphones.
 
 “The new facility will help reduce human interaction, check corruption and farmers will be able to get online maps and ownership-related details on their mobile. It will help us put a stop to any tampering with land records,” the commissioner said.
