GURUGRAM: Two workers at Suzuki’s bike   in Kherki Daula suffered burn injuries when   which was leaking from an LPG   caught fire while they were doing welding work on Saturday morning.

 Other workers, however, managed to douse the flames within minutes with the help of fire safety equipment in the plant. The victims — Baljeet Singh and Anil Kumar — are being treated at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital where they were referred to by a city-based private hospital.
 
 Following the incident, some workers stopped work for an hour, claiming the fire could have been prevented had the company management not turned a blind eye to their repeated complaints of gas leakage in the plant.
 
 Police said the fire broke out around 7 am when Singh, originally from Bhiwani district, and Kumar, who belongs to Sonipat district, were doing welding work on a bike. The welding was being done using a gas cylinder that was kept near them.
 
 The duo smelled gas that was leaking from the cylinder but before they could react, it caught fire. The flames soon spread to Singh’s clothes and he sustained 40% burns. Kumar also suffered 25% burns while trying to douse the fire, cops said.
 
 Other workers rushed to the site immediately and doused the flames within minutes. Singh and Kumar were rushed to a private hospital, where they were referred to Safdarjung Hospital.
 
 “On a number of occasions, we told the company management about gas   at the welding section. But it did nothing for the safety of employees,” said a company employee, on condition of anonymity.
 
 “We are waiting for the statement of the injured employees. On the basis of their statement, action will be taken as per law,” said inspector Yashwant Yadav, SHO of Kherki Daula police station.
 
 When contacted, a company official said, “The injured are being given all possible help and we are looking into the matter. We are also investigating the cause behind the incident.”
