KOLHAPUR: School students will be given lessons on power conservation and safe handling of the   very soon. 

 Chief engineer of Kolhapur zone of MSEDCL, M G Shinde on Thursday said, “There is an acute power shortage across the state especially during summers. Therefore, we have decided to start a campaign for school level students. This is an annual campaign and we will be focusing on the importance of power conservation and safe handling of electric appliances at home.”
 
 “There has been a manifold increase in electricity consumption in the last few decades. Natural resources are depleted at a faster rate. We need to take an urgent action and preserve as much electricity we can. School going students are the best source to spread this information to their family and friends. We hope that this step will be curb the electricity consumption across the city,” he said.
 
 “Our focus will also be to avoid accidents due to electric shock. On this background, we have selected school children for our campaign who help us organise the campaign successfully. Our engineer level officers will be visiting the schools to interact with the students and their teachers,” he added.
 
  principal   said, “ You will find power saving placards across the school wall. We have taught our students to switch off the tube light, bulb and fans before leaving the class room. We are actively involved in the power saving campaign for the past many years.”
 
 “We welcome the MSEDCL approach to train our students regarding safe handling of electronic appliances and the need for power consumption,” he added. 
 
 Over 3500 school including   across the district will be a part of the MSEDCL power conservation campaign.
