NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court sought explanation on Monday from   Ashok Chauhan on steps taken by him to help out a law student who had committed suicide after being denied to appear in the examination due to poor attendance.

 A bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit said it was necessary for Chauhan to file affidavit for the court to know his stand as the student, Sushant Rohilla, had written a mail to him before committing suicide. 
 
 The apex court had in September last year taken suo motu cognisance of a letter written by Rohilla‘s friend Raghav Sharma to the Chief Justice of India, blaming the   authorities for the suicide on August 10, 2016. The court had also appointed senior advocate F S Nariman as amicus curiae to assist it in the case.
 
 Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Amity, told the bench that its law school had nothing to do with the University and there was no need to direct Chauhan to file affidavit. He said the law school was affiliated to   and followed rules and regulations of Bar Council of India.
 
 But his plea was opposed by Nariman who contended that Chauhan should be asked to explain what he had done after receiving the student’s mail.
