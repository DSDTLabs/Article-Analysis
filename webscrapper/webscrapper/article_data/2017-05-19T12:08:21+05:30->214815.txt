THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: In consultation with  , government will explore ways to provide relief to the victims of   by   in Plachimada, Palakkad.

 The government’s move comes in the wake of President Pranab Mukherjee denying assent to the bill passed by the state assembly in this regard.
 
 In a reply to the submission raised by Mannarkkad MLA N Shamsuddin in the assembly, law and parliamentary affairs minister A K Balan said the President had denied assent to the bill as it had many provisions which were in the Act passed by the central government for setting up the green tribunal.
 
 He said the government will explore possibilities of approaching other legal forums since the matter cannot be taken up in the green tribunal as it will consider cases registered only after 2005. 
 
 Shamsuddin said the state had to face the situation as the provisions of the act were prepared without proper application of mind.
 
 The Centre had scrapped the state’s Plachimada Coca Cola Victims’ Relief and Compensation Claims   passed by the assembly in 2011, terming it as unconstitutional as it violates the provisions of the law executed by Parliament under article 253 of the Constitution.
