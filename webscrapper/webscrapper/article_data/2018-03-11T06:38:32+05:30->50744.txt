PATNA: No one would be spared for damaging statues of leaders anywhere in the country, Union minister of state for home Kiren   said in Patna on Saturday.

 Talking to reporters on the sidelines of official language conference of East and   regions, Rijiju said Union   has issued an advisory in this regard and all states have been asked to take strong action against people indulging in such offences.
 
 “PM   has also given strict instructions on this issue,” Rijiju said. “Now that the Centre has issued advisory on this issue, it is the responsibility of the state governments to prevent such incidents. States should take stringent steps in this regard,” he said.
 
 Two statues of communist icon Vladimir Lenin were brought down in south Tripura and a statue of Periyar was stoned in Tamil Nadu’s Vellore district earlier this week. On Wednesday, Jana Sangh founder Shyama Prasad Mukherjee’s bust was reportedly defaced in Kolkata.
 
 Sources said Ministry of Home Affairs issued two advisories on the issue on Wednesday. The first advisory asked the states to take stern action against persons damaging statues and book them under relevant provisions of law. The second advisory asked the state governments and union territories to ensure that DMs and SPs take all possible action to control the law and order situation in their areas of jurisdiction.
 
 Sources said the DMs and SPs were also directed through the second advisory to ensure strict vigil on antisocial elements, social media and rumourmongers and strong action against anyone indulging in violence or inciting violence.
 
 Speaking at the event, Rijiju said he became a popular leader in a short span of time owing to his good grasp of Hindi. “People should use Hindi while visiting foreign countries as well,” he said.
