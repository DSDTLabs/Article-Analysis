KORAPUT: It is not the living persons who experience horrific conditions at the subdivisional hospital of Jeypore in   district. Even the dead are not spared.

 The cadaver cold storage unit with two compartments at the mortuary has not been working since 2005 and the bodies decompose beyond recognition, if stored, inside the defunct units.
 
 Officials said as per rule, it is mandatory to keep unidentified bodies for at least three days to be identified by the family of the deceased. But due to non-availability of the cold storage, bodies are not being preserved. If the bodies are kept out, flies swarm all over them. 
 
 "When any unidentified patient dies at the hospital during treatment, it is mandatory to preserve the body for at least three days. But we are unable to keep the body due to the defunct freezer," said sub-divisional medical officer (Jeypore) Sitanshu Satapathy.
 
 Sometimes police bring unidentified bodies for autopsy and after postmortem the body should be kept at the cadaver cold storage unit. But that is not always possible, he added.
 
 Also, police take at least two days to do paper work of unknown bodies. So when the bodies are kept in open, they decompose. There have been many instances of bodies being putrefied. Officials said the decomposition rate increases in summer.
 
 According to official sources, the freezer developed technical snag in 2005 and has been defunct since then. Subsequently, a few parts of the freezer got stolen and the hospital authorities remained silent by lodging a police complaint but took no pain to either replace the defunct cooling chambers with new ones or to get it repaired. "I will take up the matter with higher authorities" said Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati.
