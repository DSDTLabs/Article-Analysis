KOLKATA: This year’s state budget, to be tabled in the Assembly on Wednesday by finance minister Amit Mitra, will be the first of its kind in the GST regime like the Union Budget. Mitra will have his task cut out ahead of two important elections — the panchayat polls in 2018 and the Lok Sabha election in 2019.

 In the post-GST regime there is hardly any possibility to tweak tax rates except for liquor, petrol and the stamp duties. Only thing an FM can do is prioritising expenditures. This time the government has to tweak budgetary allocations for some key areas — panchayat and rural development and health and education — and also the centrally-assisted projects for which the   government has either slashed or stopped grants. The state has so far maintained a good track record of capital expenditure that generates assets. This year a major challenge will be to maintain the growth in capital expenditure. There has been a seven-fold growth in capital expenditure in the last six years.
 
 The state economy, barring a near Rs 3 lakh crore debt burden and subsequent debt servicing, looks healthier going by figures. The gross state domestic product (GSDP) is touching the Rs 10 lakh crore mark in 2016-17 from Rs 4.60 lakh crore in 2010-11, making it among top 5 economies in India. Though the total debt stock has gone up, the debt to GSDP ratio has gone down from 40.65% in 2010-11to 33.71% in 2016-17, following high growth in GSDP.
 
 The revenue deficit to GSDP is approaching almost zero. From 3.75% in 2010-11 it came down to 0.96% in 2016-17. “It has come down below 1% and we are hoping that it will soon become zero. This is because of better expenditure disciplines,” an official said. The fiscal deficit to GSDP has also come down to 2.56% (revised estimates) in 2016-17 from 4.24% in 2010-11. The plan expenditure has gone up four fold to Rs 57,693 crore in 2016-17 in six years.
 
 Economist   felt that this state budget would be more like an expenditure budget. “In the income side, the tax administration can be improved and tax base can be widened. One good thing I would say is that the committed expenditure has dipped in last few years,” he added. The former head of the department of economics at ISI, Dipankar Dasgupta, also said that this budget would be more of an expenditure statement. “I feel that there could be thrust on social sectors,” he added.  , chairman state taxes committee of MCCI, feels that state has a scope to enhance income.
 
 Director general of  , Rajeev Singh, pointed out that the focus on agriculture, education and health is extremely important. President of Bharat Chamber Sitaram Sharma felt that after demonetisation and GST, housing and construction sectors in Bengal have suffered a setback leading to lack of market for constructed floor space both in the housing and commercial sectors.
