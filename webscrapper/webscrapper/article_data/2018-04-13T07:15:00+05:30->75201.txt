GHAZIABAD: Two students attending class at a government secondary school in Ghaziabad’s Pasonda had a narrow escape on Thursday after a mound of plaster peeled off the ceiling and fell on them.

 Class VI students Inshad (13) and   (14) escaped with minor injuries and their health conditions were said to be stable. Police said Inshad had suffered an injury to the leg and was admitted to GTB Hospital in Delhi.
 
 “The incident took place around 10am when a teacher was taking class. Two minor boys suffered injuries and one of them is in GTB Hospital. The other boy didn’t need to be taken to the hospital as portions of the plaster fell on his back. We have sent a report in this regard to the education department,” Sahibabad circle officer DSP Rakesh Mishra said.
 
 Administrative officials, who visited the school after the accident, said some of the rooms were in dire need of repairs. “There are three rooms in the school building that are relatively well-maintained and fit for use. However, one of the better rooms of the school was being used as a store. The students who had been using this room had recently been shifted to the dilapidated room. Prima facie, it appears there was negligence on the part of the school teachers. Necessary action would be taken against them,” district basic education officer   said.
