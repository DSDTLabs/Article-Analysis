CHENNAI: A 78-year-old man has gone home from hospital nearly a month after getting a new heart. The patient, doctors say, is probably the oldest in the city to undergo a  . 

 Subramanian was diagnosed with ischemic  , where arteries supplying blood to the heart muscle narrowed leading to heart failure. He also had hypertension and diabetes. 
 
 In November 2016, when he came to   with disorientation and weakness of limbs, he was referred to neurologists. Scans showed a block in the blood vessels and specialists recommended a surgery. But doctors knew his heart condition wouldn't permit them to open his skull. They also knew that besides his age, there were no serious concerns to have his heart corrected. His kidney function was impaired but it would improve if the heart was treated. 
 
 "The only option left was a heart transplant. So we wait-listed him," said Dr Suresh Rao, head, cardiac anaesthesia and critical care. A month later, they found a 43-year old donor. After a successful surgery and rough recovery period, scans showed his heart improved. Symptoms of a brain clot vanished and he was declared fit for discharge. 
 
 There are currently no policies on age of recipients or the circumstances for a transplant. "We told the family about the risks involved but the patient told us he would rather die on the table than suffer from a poor quality of life," said senior cardiac surgeon  . 
 
 Doctors admit his case is probably an exception. Surgeons don't expect a flood of older patients and most elderly with failing hearts aren't good candidates for demanding transplant surgeries, and organs too continue to be scarce.
