MUMBAI: Some unknown person kept a   on railway track near   and this led to delay in train services in   during morning peak hours.

 The railway authorities made announcements at all stations along Harbour route that trains are running late this morning. A senior official said that a team was sent to remove the bicycle and ensure that there was no problem on tracks before services resumed.
 
 There was however bunching of trains and this led to delays in running of locals. 
 
 A day earlier, Harbour line commuters were majorly inconvenienced with the 8-hour traffic block and the work extending by another hour on Sunday evening.
