PATNA: The   (BSHSA) has given a call to doctors based in the state to “boycott work” on February 14 in protest against the alleged mishandling of a Hajipur sadar hospital’s doctor by a  . The state unit of IMA has supported the call.

 BSHSA general secretary Dr   said on Sunday he has appealed to all the private and government doctors not to give their services on Tuesday. “The OPD and IPD (in-patient department) services in the hospitals in the state will be paralysed. Only emergency and postmortem services have been kept out of the purview of the call,” he said.
 
 The ugly confrontation between Dr Arvind Kumar and DSP S Gupta took place in Hajipur on Friday evening. Hajipur-based doctors -- government and private -- proceeded on indefinite strike from the next day, demanding action against the DSP.
 
 “The doctor was examining patients in the morning when the DSP reached the hospital and asked him to examine his patient first. The DSP and his driver beat up the doctor brutally when he refused to oblige the cop,” the BSHSA functionary alleged. The DSP could not be reached for his comments.
 
 Dr Ranjit Kumar said he would write to the principal secretary (health) on Monday, informing him about the work boycott call.
 
 State IMA general secretary Dr   said they would urge doctors to exempt IPD services too. “Protesting doctors should boycott only their regular OPD duty,” he said.
