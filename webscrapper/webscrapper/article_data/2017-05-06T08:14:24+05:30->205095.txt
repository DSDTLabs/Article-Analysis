PANAJI: The Goa Pradesh Congress Committee recently lashed out at   (GFP) for coming out in support of expansion of coal handling at   Congress spokesperson   said that the coal was being  , but it is Goa that’s paying the price.

 “There is visible pollution. People have clearly indicated that they are against it. What made Goa Forward come out in support of a company in Karnataka? If they want to support the coal companies, they should rename their party as Karnataka Forward,” Kawthankar said.
 
 GFP came out in support of MPT’s proposal to enhance coal handling capabilities on grounds of the state’s dependence on power from central grids. A public hearing was held at Tilak Maidan, Vasco, to deliberate on MPT’s expansion plans for coal handling.
 
 Congress also slammed the PWD for issuing a circular curbing pre-monsoon works. “This circular is dangerous and it is a result of the debt that the government has put the state in. They should prioritize what is important and what isn’t important, if their financial state is so bad. But issuing a circular and giving instructions that no tender should be floated for pre-monsoon work is barbaric,” Kawthankar said, adding that if pre-monsoon works were not taken up, the roads and drains would flood in the monsoon.
