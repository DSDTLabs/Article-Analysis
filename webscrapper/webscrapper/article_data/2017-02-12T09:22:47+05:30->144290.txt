HYDERABAD: The   has no plans of amending the government order related to the chief minister's overseas   for minorities (CMOSSM). 

 With the objective of giving wings to aspirations of students from minority communities, willing to pursue a masters degree in foreign universities, the government introduced the scheme in May 2015. The beneficiary would receive 10 lakh in two instalments. This was later enhanced to 20 lakh. 
 
 However, applicants such as  , a resident of Amberpet, pointed out that those who wish to pursue a one-year post graduate course are ineligible. This, despite courses and the universities being recognised.
 
 Minorities Welfare Department secretary   ruled out changing the guidelines. Speaking to TOI, he explained that these were framed after deliberations with the Scheduled Castes Development Department. The CMOSSM was modelled on the lines of a similar scheme for Scheduled Castes. 
 
 "There are several dubious institutions which claim to be universities. They thrive on funds of overseas students. The degrees offered by these fly by night universities are not good enough for the market. This is why we have taken a decision to approve applications of those who apply for a two-year course," Jaleel said. 
 
 The department has decided that a certificate in English proficiency such as IELTS or TOEFL is mandatory as some students, poor in English, are taking six-month courses in English. "The government is paying for the masters degree but not the English improvement course. Hence, the proficiency certificate has been made mandatory," the secretary said.
