 TV actress   aka   from the serial Chidyaghar was in Lucknow a few weeks ago. 
 
 Born and brought up in Meerut, Shafaq says she has been to Lucknow earlier but mostly for promotional activities for her shows. 
 
 “Lucknow is a lovely city. I especially love the historical look that the city has.I like Lucknow even more be cause of its adab and lihaaz wala culture. The people here are courteous and of course, the food is awesome ­ the Lakhnawi kebabs are something to die for,“ she says.
 
  
  
 Shafaq, who has done a lot of saas-bahu serials before turning to comedy, finds both genres equally difficult, “Acting in both comedy and saas-bahu serials is equally difficult. One has to prepare and put equal amount of hard work to make the audience believe and appreciate your acting skills. So, there should be no comparison between the two genres of acting.“
