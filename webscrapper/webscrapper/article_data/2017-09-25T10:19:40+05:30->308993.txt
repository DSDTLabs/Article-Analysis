CHANDIGARH: The police on Sunday freed the son of a Bahadurgarh   from his abductors after a fierce encounter in Asauda village of Jhajjar. One head constable was injured in the operation. Abhishek, son of priest   Mathew, was kidnapped while returning home from a professional institute in Rohini, Delhi, on Thursday. Police said Zavier received a call seeking a ransom of Rs 76 lakh for his son's release on Thursday night and informed cops. When the kidnappers called, Xavier negotiated with them and a deal was struck at Rs 25 lakh.

 The kidnappers fixed a place near Asauda and Barahi villages for picking up the ransom amount. Meanwhile, crime branch teams were deployed there under Jhajjar SP B Sathish Balan.
 
 Police said the person who had gone to deliver the ransom amount raised an alarm when the kidnappers refused to release the youth even after taking the money.
 
 Balan said the cops then quickly rescued the victim. It led to an exchange of fire between the cops and the abductors, in which head constable Ravinder Singh was injured. The cops then overpowered the kidnapper who had opened fire on Ravinder.
 
 â€œOur priority was rescuing the boy. Our team is interrogating the accused," DGP BS Sandhu said.
