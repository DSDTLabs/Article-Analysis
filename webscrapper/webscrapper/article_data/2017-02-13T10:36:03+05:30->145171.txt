Popular show ' ' has the lead female protagonist   playing double roles in it. Juhi is very happy that she is working with Swastik Productions. She shares, "Working with Siddharth is a learning experience. This is the first time I am working with him as a director. I have worked with him when he was producing. He is absolutely brilliant. He knows exactly what he wants and explains to you in such a way that you get it right. And you know what is to be delivered. There were   when I used to do scenes in my way, then he used to come up to me and explain and I used to perform exactly the same as the scene. I am very very happy that I got this opportunity to work with him and I am thankful to him that he chose me to play Sanghya and Chaya. And most importantly he had that faith in me that I would be able to play these difficult characters."
