Thiruvananthapuram: The Nemom police on Wednesday arrested a man, who was wanted in connection with sexually harassing a nine-year-old. The police identified the accused as Sadhu Kunju (49) of Pravachambalam under Nemom police station limits. 

 The accused was wanted by the police for allegedly sexually harassing the daughter of his neighbour. The alleged crime had taken place on Sunday, when the girl’s father left her at the residence of the accused before going out for work. 
 
 The girl’s mother had died of cancer and she was raised by her father, who is a daily-wage labourer. Since the accused was also a father of two girls, he used to entrust his daughter in the latter’s custody whenever he had to go out for work. But, on Sunday, Sadhukunju’s wife and daughters were not at home and the accused exploited this situation to sexually harass the girl. He had even threatened the girl not to reveal the incident to anyone. 
 
 The girl, however, told the matter to her father on that night itself following which he filed a complaint before the police the next day. The accused was on the run since then. He was arrested by a team led by Nemom circle inspector K Pradeep. He was produced before the court and was remanded in judicial custody.tnn
