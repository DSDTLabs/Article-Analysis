CHENNAI: A day after the election commission cancelled the   following allegations of money distribution to voters,   (Amma) faction hit out at the opposition parties, and the BJP government at the Centre, stating that they have ganged up to attempt to destroy the party and destabilize the state government by levelling false charges.

 “We will overcome the challenges. They will not win for sure,” party deputy general secretary   said, emerging from a two-hour long session with party functionaries at the headquarters here. Sasikala's nephew, whose faction was blamed for all wrong reasons, denied any inducements and allurements by his supporters for victory. The faction contesting on hat symbol, after election commission froze their two leaves symbol acknowledging the split in the party, drew huge number of outstation functionaries and cadres for the election work.
 
 The leader trained his guns on the Modi government, in particular. “The Centre's role could be gauged from the I-T raids (in health minister C Vijayabaskar's residence) and the 29-page order of the election commission (cancelling the bypoll). It is all a planned drama of BJP, as they cannot get back even their election deposit and foresee my victory in the constituency. Election Commission has fallen into the trap of opposition,” the leader said.
 
 Reacting to the I-T summons to the health minister on Monday, after seizure of documents at his premises and associates across the state, Dhinakaran said, “I don't understand why the seizure of money from Vijayabaskar’s associate should be linked to   bypoll.”
