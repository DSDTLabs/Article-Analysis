MUMBAI: Activists raised concerns as thousands of Mumbaikars visited   zoo on the first Sunday after the inauguration of the   enclosure. Many said the sudden inflow of such enormous crowds to the exhibit area could lead to the birds’ stress levels going up. 

 Authorities at the enclosure were continuously trying to limit the number of people entering the exhibit area on Sunday but the crowd only kept swelling. By the end of Sunday, over 20,000 people had visited the zoo, the authorities said.
 
 Dr Rina Dev, an avian and exotic expert from Bandra, said penguins get stressed very easily. “It’s essential that the penguins are gradually introduced to such large crowds. You cannot have thousands of people looking at them in one day. Generally, when penguins get stressed they refuse to eat or may start moulting (shedding feathers). The authorities need to limit the crowds,” said Dr Dev. 
 
 Pawan Sharma, founder of the RAWW NGO said the penguins had been recently brought out of quarantine and put in a new enclosure, so they will be traumatized if they suddenly see so many people. “Within the quarantine area, the birds were used to watching the doctors and keepers. Suddenly, if so many people are continuously staring at them, it could stress them out. The zoo authorities need to work out a way to regulate such large crowds,” said Sharma. 
 
 Ever since the birds were brought to Mumbai in July last year, they were quarantined. They were shifted to a new enclosure within an interpretation centre of the zoo on March 6.
 
 Activist Stalin Dayanand said excessive human exposure to animals and birds is known to intimidate them. “Besides, Byculla zoo does not have the capacity to handle so many   in one day,” said Stalin. 
 
 BMC spent over Rs 2 crore on procuring six penguins from Coex Aquarium in Seoul, South Korea; two were given free. One of them died last October due to an infection.
