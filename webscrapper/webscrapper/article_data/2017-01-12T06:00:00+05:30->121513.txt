KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police will investigate an alleged   involving the pilferage of   (EPF) and   (ESI) contributions of over 1,500 Group-D contractual staffers in state-run teaching hospitals since 2011. The decision was taken after several workers wrote to   and the   through Calcutta high court advocate Sourjya Ghosh.

 In 2015, EPF and ESI officials ticked-off hospital administrators on several occasions and a number of superintendents had admitted that internal audits are required, but no steps were taken to stop this pilferage.
 
 “On Wednesday, I received a call from the office of the assistant commissioner-II, central division, Kolkata Police, informing me that he will be in charge of the investigation. We hope these poor workers get justice. Crores have been pilfered over the last few years, but no steps were taken. Authorities have finally taken notice after I threatened to move the high court,” Ghosh said. 
 
 The workers identified Suman Chatterjee as the owner of several agencies that hire workers on contract basis. Chatterjee reportedly runs his business from the premises of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. When contacted, Chatterjee said, “I am just an employee. How can I be aware of the goings-on.” However, he refused to name the agenies’ owners.
 
 Ghosh claimed the agencies also succeeded in getting fake work orders cleared by hospitals authorities. “In some cases, less than 50% of stipulated workers were supplied while payment was received for the whole group, ” he added.
