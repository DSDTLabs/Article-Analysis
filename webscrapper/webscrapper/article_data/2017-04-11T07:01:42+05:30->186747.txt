 K Ratna Prabha, Manmohan Singh, Adityanath Das, SV Prasad, B Sam Bob and M Samuel were given Rs 7.56 lakh each by the government through GO Rt No 719 on February 19, 2014. The petitioner said the IAS officers have to obtain stamped receipts from the advocate for the fee and furnish to the state. Though this was not done, the tax sleuths remained silent despite representations to them to act in the matter, Penjuri Venu Gopal, counsel for the petitioner said.
 
 The bench, however, felt the plea has elements of public interest in it and directed the registry to post it before an appropriate judicial bench.
