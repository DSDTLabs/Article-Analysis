KOCHI: A stretch of the   turned black at   near   industrial belt on Thursday. The discolouration of water was noticed by residents around 7.30am. Carbon dust with a thick film of oil was floating on the river from Pathalam to Eloor. They immediately alerted the pollution control board officials who came to the site and collected water samples from the area where colour change was observed.

 Environmental activists in the area alleged that discolouration was caused due to excess discharge of chemical wastes into the river by industries located on the banks of river. “This is not the first time the discolouration is happening. Last year itself the colour changed more than 10 times. We strongly suspect that pollution from industrial units as the reason for the colour change as it has been the primary cause in these kind of incidents in the past,” said  , an environmental activist and a research co – ordinator with  .
 
 “Due to drop in dissolved oxygen content the water can get discoloured and gradually turn black. But at the moment we cannot immediately assess and ascertain the exact reason in this regard. Since the shutters of the Pathalam bund is not frequently opened waste materials are getting accummulated in a particular area which leads to contamination of water bodies. So we have asked the irrigation department to partially open the regulator – cum bridge so that pollutants as well as water hyacinths can be flushed out to solve the problem for the time being, ” said P B Sreelakshmy, engineer, PCB, Eloor.
