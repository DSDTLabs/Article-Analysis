Chennai: The top gear growth of utility vehicles has now earned the segment almost one-third of the total passenger vehicle market. According to the December 2017 data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, UVs now comprise 27.38% of the overall passenger vehicle market in the April-December 2017 period. This is up from just under 25% in the same period previous year . In the first 10 months of this financial year, passenger vehicle sales hit 24,25,911 units, up 8.13% over the year-ago period. A lionâ€™s share of this growth has come from UVs which grew nearly 20% in the period to hit 6,64,230 units, up from 5,56,159 units in the same period last financial year.

 The UV share in the overall passenger vehicle pie remained more or less the same for nearly a year in 2016. 
 
 In April-October 2015-16, UVs comprised just over 20% of the overall passenger vehicle sales riding on the back of several just-launched successful products like Hyundai Creta and Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza that followed. Two years on, the segment has jumped by 700 basis points (100 basis points = 1%) as more mass market and premium carmakers join the UV rush. In the interim, total passenger vehicle sales have remained mostly flat. In fact monthly sales went from 2,68,630 units a month in October 2015 to 2,39,712 units in December 2017 though the dip is because October is a festival month.
 
 Meanwhile monthly sales for SUVs went from 58,121 units in October 2015 to 67,073 units in December 2017, up 15.40% in just over two years. As more and more new SUV models line up for India debut the SUV share is expected to go up around 40% of the market, say analysts.
