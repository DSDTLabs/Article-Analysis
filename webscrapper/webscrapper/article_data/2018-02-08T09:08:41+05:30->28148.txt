QUEPEM: Holding bottles of muddy water and empty pots, residents of  , a village within the jurisdiction of the   panchayat, on Wednesday protested the government’s failure to supply drinking water and roads in their area.

 The only borewell in the predominantly dhangar populated area was drilled around 40 years ago and has a 100 litre water tank on top, a villager said. “The source has become corroded and the water is muddy and unsafe,” Dhulo Velip, a resident, said.
 
 The pump, which works on a solar connection, functions erratically.
 
 The villagers, led by the   unit, demanded that they be supplied water through tankers. They criticised authorities and four-time MLA  . Later, they visited the offices of PWD and   deputy collector. PWD assistant engineer V S   assured them of tanker water supply after two days, on temporary basis.
 
 Residents also said the village’s only 5-km-long road, which is untarred, becomes unmotorable during the monsoon and even ambulances refuse to enter the area.
