MUMBAI: The Bombay   has directed the BMC to state if additional flats on podium level can be permitted in Shimmer, a residential tower in   (west) to accommodate buyers who were sold flats in unsanctioned floors. The buyers, who were duped by Kamlashri builders, submitted a proposal earlier this week to add few more floors and modify the plans to ensure maximum possible accommodation. Justice S J Kathawalla directed the executive engineer to submit his comments in court on the plans on March 29.

 Kamlashri Builders had relied on a commencement certificate, “till 17th floor”, which the HC has observed is “forged and fabricated.”
 
 The fate of the buyers still stands unresolved for months after builder Jitendra Jain and his brother were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing in a case for cheating and forgery. 
 
 To ensure that the hapless buyers, original occupants of two buildings which were razed and redeveloped as Shimmer, a 14-storeyed   in a prime spot in the western suburb, get their flats, the HC also appointed a committee of 10 people including buyers, an independent architect Amol Shetgiri to complete the construction. The HC said the builders “downright cheated flat purchasers by collecting Rs 68 crore, promising flats in a 17-storey tower” 
 
 The builder had sold 35 flats when legally he could sell only 22.
 
  Buyers’ lawyer has submitted a new proposal in court to try and fit in maximum possible buyers and compensate the remaining. An alternate plan suggested was to auction the premises.
