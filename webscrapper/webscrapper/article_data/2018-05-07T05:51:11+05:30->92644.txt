KOLKATA: Taking a cue from the  , which has shifted to vegetarian menu for its internal meetings, the   has also decided not to serve any food items like kebabs, biryani or anything that has chicken and mutton in it at its member mayor in council or board meetings for now.

 Bidhannagar Municipal Corporation (BMC) mayor Sabyasachi Dutta said that the decision was a fallout of the  . “No chicken and mutton related food will be served for now. God knows what kind of meat products I have eaten in the last few years,” the mayor said.
 
 Dutta, who is fond of biryani, has decided not to touch any kind of biryani or kebabs for the time being.
 
 Dutta said that a civic team led by MMiC (health) Pranay Roy would conduct inspections at various eateries and restaurants in Salt Lake and adjacent places within the corporation area to check the quality of meat that is being supplied to these food joints. There are several popular eateries and restaurants in Salt Lake which are known for serving delicious kebabs and biryani.
 
 Civic officials said that the authorities have sent a request to the state health department to appoint a food inspector for them. “Presently, the civic body does not have a specialised food inspector to check the quality of food at eateries under its jurisdiction. A food inspector on a temporary basis can also solve the problem for now,” a civic official said.
 
 The KMC authorities have so far carried inspections at several eateries in Alipore and Kidderpore area and have destroyed large quantities of meat that was either stale or had contained spurious colour.
 
 The Bidhannagar civic authorities are also keeping an eye on the canteen being run on the Poura Bhavan premises in Salt Lake. “Though there is no possibility to store carcass meat there since it has no refrigerator, those who run the canteen have been instructed to check the quality of meat items they serve,” said a civic official.
