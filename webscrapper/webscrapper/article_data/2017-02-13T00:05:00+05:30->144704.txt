Reality show   witnessed some high drama this week. Reason? Huccha Venkat who is a contestant on the show, in his trademark fashion, made a few snide remarks that caused some tense moments on the show that also led to one of the celeb judges to walk out.
It so happened that during the course of the shoot, Venkat who is known for his unusual ways, happened to make unsavoury remarks about item numbers. Irked by his words,   Dwivedi who along with Sharmiela Mandre was a celebrity judge for the week, told Venkat that unless asked for an opinion, he should refrain from giving it. Soon after, Venkat performed a dance number with his partner and got a rating of 4 from Ragini. Taking offence to this, he stormed out of the show. Ragini, too staged a walk out. “Understandably, Ragini was upset and she didn’t return to the sets. Venkat came back after a while and apologised to all for his behaviour,” sums up a source from the channel.
