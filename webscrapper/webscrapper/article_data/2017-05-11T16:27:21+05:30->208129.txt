Ever since the news of   Entertainment Television bringing back   has come out, rumours about   not hosting it due to clash with   11 has also been doing the rounds. However, Timesofindia.com has exclusively learnt that the Bollywood superstar will be hosting both the shows.
 
  Sources close to both the shows informed us that Sony Entertainment Television is very keen to do Dus Ka Dum with Salman Khan and are even ready to wait for him.
  
  
 
  
  Hence, Salman and Sony TV have mutually arrived at a conclusion that the show will happen next year. The Sultan star will shoot Dus Ka Dum in January 2017.
  
  Bigg Boss will air early this year. It will come in three weeks early as the channel ( ) is not planning to bring   and apparently   also this year.
  
  
 
  
  Salman will finish shooting for Bigg Boss 11 by end of the year and might take up Dus Ka Dum season three in early 2017. With The   Show going nowhere, Sony TV is not willing to take a chance. Salman shares a close rapport with Colors and would not like to ruin it.
  
  Salman has previously hosted two seasons of Dus Ka Dum which have done well. The show also saw many of his close friends from the Industry and field of sports making appearance.
  
  On the other hand, this year Salman will be hosting the Eleventh season of Bigg Boss.
