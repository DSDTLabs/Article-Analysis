LUCKNOW:  's ambitious housing projects could be delayed for a while. This comes in the wake of its   estimating an amount of about Rs 6,000 crore for farmers in exchange for their land. As per LDA, the authority doesn't have the amount, the highest estimated for acquisition yet. 

 LDA has planned housing projects in Chak Ganjaria on Sultanpur Road, Vasantkunj Project on Hardoi Road, Ujariyaon project in Gomtinagar and Prabandh Nagar Yojna on IIM Road. In many of these, infrastructure development has already begun. LDA officials said after the new land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement law was imposed in 2015, the authorities are liable to pay four times the DM circle rate to farmers. This has escalated the cost significantly.
 
 LDA secretary Arun Kumar said, "This is too high an estimate for compensation to be given to farmers for land acquisition under our schemes. In the previous years, the acquisition cost was almost one-fourth or one-third of the present estimate. This will make it difficult for us to execute the projects fast."
