Guntur: “The contribution of DVS Prasad and his wife to our village is massive. The couple funded construction of roads, community halls and setting up of drinking water facilities,” said Dr Prakasa Rao of Medical and Cultural Association of Repalle.

 As a youth, DVS Prasad dreamt of making millions. Meritorious in studies, Prasad went to America to further his career after completing graduation in engineering. He worked with top multinational companies, including Deloitte and PricewaterhouseCoopers.
 
 By his own admission, Prasad felt uncomfortable with his growing bank balance. He realised that the solution for him was paying back to society. Prasad, who spent over two-decades in US, gained peace after returning to India and serving society. His wife Sunitha, a dental professional, backed him throughout and helped him start a trust in the memory of Prasad’s parents.
 
 Prasad initially adopted Jillepalli village and wanted to expand activities to the neighbouring areas in a phased manner. The locals were overwhelmed with the initiatives of Prasad and his wife. The trust took up a number of activities, including developmental activities and welfare programmes.
 
 DVS Prasad is keen on sponsoring students of underprivileged sections to pursue higher-education. “Education will help them beat poverty and help society. We need to help every child,” Prasad told TOI.
