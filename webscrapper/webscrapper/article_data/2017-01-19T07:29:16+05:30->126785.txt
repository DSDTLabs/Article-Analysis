LUCKNOW: Bahujan   chief   will start her election campaign from February 1 from two western UP districts --Aligarh and Meerut. The two Muslim-dominated districts have been carefully chosen in view of the party's strategy in these elections to woo the minority community to augment its vote bank.

 In 2012 elections as well, Maya had launched the party's campaign on February 1. But that time she was the chief minister and lost to a young Akhilesh Yadav . This time she is facing the challenger to make a comeback and her task has been made tougher by the likelihood of SP-Congress alliance.
 
 â€œThe BSP chief, who is depending largely on Muslim votes and has given maximum 97 tickets to the candidates for minority community . She was hopeful that in view of an immi nent split in SP and Congress being bad shape, BSP would be the first choice of Muslims. But in view of the changed scenario post   verdict in favour of Akhilesh and likely tie-up of SP and Congress, she may have to go for a changed in strategy.
 
 So far, Mayawati has been very focused and most organized as far elections preparedness is concerned despite a slew of desertions.
