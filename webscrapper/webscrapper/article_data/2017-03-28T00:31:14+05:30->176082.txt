Bhopal: Handwriting of   Muzaffar, the key accused in the Bhopal-Ujjain train blast case, will be matched with the documents seized by Uttar Pradesh police from the house of Saifullah who was killed in an encounter on March 8, a day after the blast that injured 10 people.

 The three accused — Mohammed Danish, 27, Syed Mir Hussain, 19, and Mohmmed Atif Muzaffar, 22, --- were produced before the court of special   judge, Gireesh Dixit, by NIA officials here on Monday. They were in NIA custody since March 16 and their remand was coming to an end on March 27. NIA, however, did not seek any further custody and the three accused were sent to judicial remand till April 10, 2017. Sources said the handwriting sample of Atif Muzaffar was taken by the NIA officials under section 311A of CrPc. This sample will be matched with the evidences collected by the Uttar Pradesh police from the house of Saifullah, said sources. If need be, they would be taken into custody again, said sources. Special public prosecutor Ajay Gupta appeared for NIA. 
 
 On March 7, the trio placed timer pipe bomb on Bhopal-Ujjain passenger train at Bhopal railway station. The explosion injured 10 passengers, three of them seriously, when the train was approaching Jabdi station in Shajapur district around 9.40 am. All the three were arrested around 1.30 pm from a bus near Pipariya in Madhya Pradesh’s Hoshangabad district by Madhya Pradesh ATS on the same day. On March 15, the case was handed over to NIA for probe, said sources.
 
 Saifullah, who was killed in an encounter by UPATS on March 8, was suspected to be linked with the blast in the Bhopal-Ujjain train and allegedly belonged to a self-proclaimed group of ISIS supporters. He was killed on the outskirts of Lucknow after a 12-hour police operation. They had zeroed in on Saifullah following inputs from the same Atif Muzaffar, the self-motivated ‘jihadist’ behind the train blast.
