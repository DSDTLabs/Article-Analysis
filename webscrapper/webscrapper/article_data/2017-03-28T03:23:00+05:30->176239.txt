Margao: During the gram sabha meeting held on Sunday, apprehensions were raised by Lotoulim villagers regarding the recent remarks made by chief minister Manohar Parrikar and town and country planning (TCP) department minister Vijai Sardessai about the setting up of a garbage treatment plant at the Verna industrial estate. One of the villagers, Franky Monteiro told TOI that Lotoulim villagers had firmly objected to the proposal of the Mormugao municipal council (MMC) following the directives of the South Goa collector to set up a garbage dump on a site identified adjacent to the national highway missing link, which is a sloping area with residential houses located below. “There is also a possibility of contamination of the drinking water wells and natural springs as well as destruction of the paddy fields in the vicinity. Hence, a resolution was unanimously passed by the gram sabha chaired by the deputy sarpanch Mario Pereira that the proposed land for the garbage plant be identified. Since, the villagers are firmly opposed to the site that was identified last time,” said Monteiro. The gram sabha also directed the village panchayat to conduct the auction for the sopo tax collected by the panchayat in view of it expiring on March 31 pointing out that the village panchayat would lose substantial revenue should the election code of conduct be enforced by the state election authorities.  Another issue raised was that of the Saturday market wherein vendors keep their wares blocking the roads. It was decided to write to the police to curb this menace and regulate the traffic especially on Saturday mornings, added Monteiro.
