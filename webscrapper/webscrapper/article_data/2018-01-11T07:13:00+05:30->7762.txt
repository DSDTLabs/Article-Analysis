GURGAON: A series burglaries in societies in Sector 47, 52 and 45 reported all through December 2017 have left residents fearful for their life and property. The robbers have routinely stolen only cash and jewellery and CCTV footage acquired from the societies shows the robbers were carrying similar weapons and had a physical resemblance. 

 Residents from Antariksh apartments,   and   reached out to TOI on Wednesday expressing their fear over the frequency of the crime.
 
 “My house was targeted by thieves on the night of December 26,” said Rohit Jagnani, a resident of Royal Residency. “Another burglary occurred the very next day, December 27, in Doordarshan apartments, Sector 45. On December 4, thieves had struck in Ardee city Sector 52 and on December 30, theft case was reported in Pragati Hill Apartment in Sector 47. All these cases have one thing in common, only cash and jewellery were stolen. Also, all the thieves had the same weapons and looked similar in appearance when we checked CCTV footage. A similar theft was reported from Olive Crescent Apartments in the last week of December.”
 
 “We are very concerned. Had it happened once or twice we would have managed but these crimes have a pattern and alarming frequency,” said Mahipal Singh, another resident. Residents suspect people from nearby illegal hutments that have sprung over the last couple of years for the thefts. “Just two years ago, there were hardly a few shanties, now there are over a hundred that surround colonies like Antariksh apartments, Royal Residency and Doordarshan apartments,” said Shobha Bhat, a Doordarshan apartment resident. “Imagine when they happen in quick succession, the fear it precipitates among residents? It is massive, we fear for our lives.” However, Gurgaon police officials could not comment on the issue. “The cases are under investigation, I cannot speak on the matter,” an official explained.
