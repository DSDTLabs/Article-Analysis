NOIDA: Commuters had to battle snarls on the expressway for nearly two hours after a private bus collided with a container truck on the Greater Noida-Noida carriageway of the Expressway during peak hours on Monday morning. 

 The accident occurred around 8.15 am on the stretch between the Advant building and Pari Chowk. The driver and conductor of the truck and the bus suffered minor injuries but around 35 passengers of the bus were not hurt.
 
  According to an eyewitness, the accident occurred when the driver of the container apparently missed the cut towards Tilapta in Dadri and tried to turn his vehicle back towards Pari Chowk.
 
 “In an attempt to take a wrong turn, the driver hit the speeding bus which was travelling from Gorakhpur to Delhi on the same carriageway,” an officer from   police said. 
 
  Ram Dayal Gupta, the owner of the bus, said: “We have reached a compromise with the other party.”
 
 Commuters travelling from   to their offices in Noida and Delhi said traffic moved at an extremely slow pace as it took time for the traffic police and civil police to remove the bus from the spot. Vanita Srivastava, who was travelling on the carriageway, said the police had to side-line the traffic on the Expressway leading to snarls.
 
 Commuters also had to battle snarls in Sector 27 ahead of   where three cars collided around 9am. 
 
 “Three cars had a minor collision in sector 127 area. Fortunately, all the ones inside escaped any major injuries but commuters had to battle snarls for around 15 minutes,” Anuj Jain who was travelling towards Delhi, told TOI.
