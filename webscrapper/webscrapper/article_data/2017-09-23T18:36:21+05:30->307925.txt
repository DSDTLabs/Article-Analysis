AGRA:   police on Saturday booked   leader 
  who slapped a girl publicly on Tuesday for being in a relationship with a man from another community following a complaint by the girl's father. 

 Aligarh SSP Rajesh Pandey said cases under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to promote breach of peace) of IPC have been registered against the leader.
 
 In a complaint, girl's father stated that on September 19 (Tuesday) his daughter went to Naurangabad market to buy something where a woman, identified as Sangeeta   had stopped her and accused her of going around with a man from other community. "My daughter refuted the allegations but they called me and then I took her back home," he stated. 
 
 He further said that his daughter told him about slapping incident when he was watching a TV report. 
 
 However, according to the video clips of the incident (in possession with TOI), the girl's father had admitted his daughter's 'mistake'. In fact he had slapped his younger daughter, who had accompanied her sister on Tuesday and also asked Sangeeta Varshney to slap the girl when she was arguing with the leader.
 
 When contacted,  , said, "If this is a crime to save the "izzat" of a Hindu woman then she is ready to do it again and again". She added that she doesn't bother of such cases and if the situation warranted, she would do it again.
 
 On Tuesday, when the 18-year-old girl came to meet her boyfriend in Naurangabad area of Aligarh, Varshney confronted her and after an argument she insisted the girl to call her parents on the spot. When the girl refused, Varshney slapped her, an act which was recorded in a video clip.
 
 The police on Wednesday had registered a case under section 294 (indulging in obscene act in public place) of the IPC against the man, Mohd Faizan, who was detained by the police after Hindu Yuva Vahini activists took him to the police station at Gandhi Park.
