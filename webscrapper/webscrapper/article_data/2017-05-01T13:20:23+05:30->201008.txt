INDORE: After it was closed down, re-opening   number 8 at MY Hospital has been delayed over officials approaching the high court for its consent.

 The operation theatre was shut in May 2016 after two children were wrongly administered nitrous oxide gas instead of oxygen.
 
 While passing an order on January 13 on an interlocutory application moved by hospital authorities, the court had put forward a condition that all norms to run the facility should be set in place before the facility is made fully functional again.
 
 After it surfaced that the gas-supply lines had been wrongly colour-coded, hospital management and a contractor appointed by PWD to conduct ‘miscellaneous work’ started playing the blame game. Also, the OT’s sterilization and disinfection process failed in two culture reports. This too resulted in the delay for the OT to re-open.
 
 Following this, a three-member committee was constituted to coordinate with concerned departments including the PWD to complete construction work and for microbiology department to provide a third cultural report. After it came back negative in the third test and PWD officials agreed to give the work-completion certificate, the   is confused over approaching the court for its consent.
 
 “In our report, we informed the hospital superintendent about receiving a   from the microbiology department as well as a work completion certificate from the PWD as is required to reopen the OT. Further decisions will be taken by him,” said HOD, anaesthesia department,  .
 
 “A discussion will be held with committee members to approach the court for its consent to reopen the OT, if required,” superintendent   told TOI.
