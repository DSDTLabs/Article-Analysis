CHANDIGARH: Fund crunch has forced the municipal corporation ( ) to stop giving permission for even minor repair   other than key development projects that have already been stalled, indicating that the civic body’s finances have hit the lowest ebb.

 
  
 
 The situation has come to such a level that the engineering department has stopped even carrying out works on the request of private companies, government and semi-government entities. That’s not all. The accounts department of the MC has issued instructions not to release a single penny to any department except for salaries of employees of the MC, bills of resident welfare associations and market welfare associations for maintaining parks and toilets. Since the MC has to spend around Rs 40 crore to 45 crore monthly over salaries of its employees, it has to look into all the other related matters.
 
 “We are not even taking money from private companies, government and semi- government deposit to carry out works related to digging of roads for laying cables. If we dig the roads, the same won’t be repaired as contractors have stopped working since their payments are yet to be released. We have stopped doing minor works,” said a senior officer.
 
 There are around 150 contractors working with the MC. Payments of a majority of them are still pending with the civic body. The contractors even met the city mayor a few days back, raising their concerns on the matter.
 
 All the major works of the engineering department were stopped around a month back, while others that were given a nod in the general house and finance and contract committee meetings were yet to start.
