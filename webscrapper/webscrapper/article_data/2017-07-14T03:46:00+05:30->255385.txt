Amravati: The paediatrics department of Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Memorial Medical College and Hospital, Amravati, where four newborns died early last month, has shut down following the resignation of ten doctors working there. The development has put child patients and infants coming to the hospital for treatment from various parts of the district in a fix. The hospital management has, however, rejected the resignations and issued these doctors show cause notices instead. The management has also started the process to recruit new doctors, so that all three paediatrics departments, including neonatal intensive care unit, can be reopened shortly. The death of four infants in early June, within a span of half-an-hour, had caused a sensation and attracted nationwide attention. It had resulted in the arrest of a doctor and a nurse, and suspension of the head of the department and the arrested doctor. Protesting this action, 10 other doctors working in the department tendered their resignations, refusing to give emergency services. They include Dr Sanket Pande, Dr AV Bajaj, Dr Arundhati Kale, Dr Rushikesh Patil, Dr Shripad Jehangirdar, Dr Pratibha Kale, Dr Narendra Tayde, Dr Pankaj Barabde, Dr Ninad Chaudhary and Dr Kaustubh Dshmukh. Following the resignations, and consequent refusal of these paediatricians to work there, the college had to close down all its three paediatrics departments, though dean Dr Dilip Jane had not accepted the resignations. Finally, Dr Jane issued show cause to the doctors on Thursday. He told media persons that once the process of recruiting new doctors is completed, all three paediatrics departments of the hospital would be reopened. The hospital is a tertiary care centre and caters to patients from tribal areas of Melghat. In view of the closure of the paediatrics departments, infants coming to the hospital for treatment would be in jeopardy.
