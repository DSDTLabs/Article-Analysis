 Police commissioner   said, “The duo was extorting money from criminals involved in illegal lottery business, sports gambling, prostitution and drug peddling. They have been dismissed with immediate effect.“
 
 Earlier, too, the two cops were accused of criminal activities. While Swaran was booked in three cases, including thrashing and abetment to suicide, Kamaljit had two cases registered against him.
 
 The dismissal order states, “After perusing the official record it is clear that their continued misconduct with cumulative effect and indulgence in criminal activities reveal incorrigibility and complete unfitness for the police service.Their retention and continuation in service will be harmful to the interest of the state as well as the general public. Though the penalty of dismissal from services is very harsh and oppressive for a public servant, but no sympathy can outweigh the consideration of the public interest and regard for public good.“ (sic) Dhoke said, “Police should be accountable. Any cop indulging in any such malpractices or misconduct will face stern action. The two have been dismissed under Article 311 (2) (b) of the Constitution of India.Therefore, neither any inquiry is marked against them nor any explanation sought.“
