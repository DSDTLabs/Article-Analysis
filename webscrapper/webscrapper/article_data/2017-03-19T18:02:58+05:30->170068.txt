MUMBAI: On the first Sunday after its inauguration over 20,000 people were seen visiting the Humboldt   within the Veermata   and Zoo in Byculla.

 Zoo officials said that large crowds continued to pour in from 9 am in the morning and there has been a steady flow of visitors since then. Dr Sanjay Tripathi, zoo director said that they had already informed the local police about the huge rush of people. "We have been monitoring the situation since morning and the crowds have been continuously flowing in," said Tripathi. 
 
 On March 17 the Shiv Sena chief   had inaugurated the Humboldt penguin enclosure.
 
 On July 26 last year, three male and five female penguins were brought into Mumbai zoo from Coex Aquarium, Seoul in South Korea. Ever since they were brought they had been kept in a quarantine facility where temperatures maintained at 16-18 degrees Celsius only to be moved into a swanky enclosure in the last week of February this year. One out of the eight penguins brought died as well owing to an infection in October 2016. The seven birds are called Olive, Molt, Bubble, Donald, Daisy, Popeye and Flipper. While the one who died was known as 'Dory'.
