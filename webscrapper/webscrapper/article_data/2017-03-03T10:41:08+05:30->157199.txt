HYDERABAD: The 10,000-member  , which has long centred around areas like A S Rao Nagar and  , has begun observing the 40-day fast or the penance titled ‘Lent’ from Wednesday which culminates into Easter Sunday.

 Speaking about the importance of the fast, which will come to a close on  , Maureen Hatch, an Anglo-Indian who has spent all her life in Hyderabad said: “For Anglo-Indians, Lent is not only about giving up non-vegetarian food, one of the things members of the community are especially fond of, but also about adopting a kinder approach to the people around them. On Good Friday, eating a ‘hot cross bun’, which is a bun marked with the symbol of a cross, is another tradition followed by the Anglo-Indian community.”
 
 According to members of the Anglo-Indian community, apart from the church ‘mass’ that is organised , other cultural events that bring members of the community together include a glitzy ‘Christmas Ball’ and a ‘Boxing Day ball’, apart from frequent lunches and picnics. While Anglo-Indian schools can be found in cities like Bangalore and Chennai, in Hyderabad there are presently none, although the city is peppered with schools affiliated to the   for Anglo-Indian Education. 
 
 This might change soon. Hyderabad is likely get its very own Anglo-Indian school, ‘Neil O' Brien public school in two years or so, confirmed members of the twin cities chapter of the   (AIAIA).
