NEW DELHI: A 22-year-old man had a lucky escape at a Delhi Metro   when he was trying to cross the tracks and a train started pulling out at the same time. 

 The incident took place on Tuesday morning. Thanks to the alert driver, who applied the brakes on time, the man survived miraculously despite falling between the train and the track and being knocked down.
 
 The incident happened around 6am at the   on   (Dilshad Garden-Rithala) when the 22-year-old man,  , was trying to cross the tracks to get to another platform. According to sources, Patel, who hails from Jaipur, was using the metro for the first time. It appears that he wanted to take a train towards the opposite direction but wasn’t aware that he had to reach the concourse area to cross over.
 
 The   footage from the platform shows the man climbing down platform no. 2 and then crossing the tracks to reach to the other side. He comes in front of a stationary train standing on the opposite platform, which starts to pull out of the station at the same time. 
 
 Patel could be seen trying to pull himself up on the platform, but the train knocks him and he falls on the track. However, the driver immediately applies the brake and comes out to check on him. By this time, Patel had managed to climb up and started walking away.
 
 “The passenger was safe and brought to the station control room.   Rail Police was called for further course of action. He was asked to pay Rs150 fine and was let off after counselling,” a DMRC spokesperson said.
 
 DMRC advises public not to cross tracks in this manner as it may prove fatal and affect its services. “Crossing or walking on tracks is a punishable offence under Delhi Metro Operations and Maintenance Act,” he said.
 
 Since January 2018, CISF has apprehended and fined 110 passengers crossing the metro tracks. To avoid such situations, DMRC would be installing platform screen doors at all its upcoming corridors, including the Magenta and Pink Lines.
