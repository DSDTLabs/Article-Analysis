NEW DELHI:   MP   has asked the government to convene a special, three-day session of Parliament to discuss increasing "judicial activism" in the country, including recent verdicts on liquor bars and dance bars. 

 In a letter to finance minister   and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Naik said the judiciary was crossing the "  Rekha" and "step by step, brick by brick, the edifice of Indian legislature is being destroyed". 
 
 Naik said just as the Prime Minister could not decide judicial matters, judges should not interfere in matters in the domain of the legislature and the executive. 
 
 The Congress lawmaker cited how the   had laid down a distance criterion from highways for operation of liquor bars. He also said the SC did not take into consideration the unemployment of lakhs of people because of closure of such outlets. He said if the courts were going to dwell on such administrative issues, what role would Parliament and state assemblies play. 
 
 "In Goa, highways pass through the heart of cities and towns, leading to closure of thousands of liquor shops and bars. The state government has not taken any initiative to approach the court and private efforts have not gone any forward," he said.
 
 Naik said the apex court was now deciding how cricket should be played and managed in India, and who should be the office-bearers and who should not be on the Board of Control for Cricket in India. It was also telling the government how droughts should be managed when the country had proper legislations to regulate national disasters, he said.
