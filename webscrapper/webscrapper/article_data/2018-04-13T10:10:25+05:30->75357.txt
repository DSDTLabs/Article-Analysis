HYDERABAD: Banjara Hills is the most liveable ward of the city with air pollution less than the city average and has been categorised as ‘dark green’ in air pollution visualisation maps prepared by city-based urban governance organisation Lakeer.

 
 On the other hand, Begumpet, Monda Market, KPHB Colony, Jeedimetla and East Anand Bagh have been categorised as ‘Red’ areas due to high air pollution, whereas Gachibowli falls under the ‘Orange’ category by Lakeer, which is measuring 40-plus indicators of liveability across Hyderabad.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Founder of Lakeer and civic entrepreneur Dipika Prasad said in a tweet that the organisation had visualised liveability at the ward-level in Hyderabad based on air pollution data on Wednesday afternoon across 150 wards of the   (GHMC).
 
 “Wards in red have lowest air quality & wards in green highest. Before you get too worried — the happy news is Hyderabad’s air quality is way better than Delhi or Bengaluru. You should decrease exposure to roads with traffic, but you can be outdoors in general. Imp - People with health sensitivities may still suffer. However the air in the wards in red (Begumpet etc) is worse than the city average, and in the wards in dark green (Banjara Hills etc) is better than the city average. Imp caveat — data verification is still pending, and data was not available for six wards out of 150 GHMC ward(sic),” tweeted Dipika Prasad.
 
  chief scientific officer P Veeranna told TOI: “The mapping can be done after preparing an emission inventory. We have four continuous monitoring stations and 18 manual monitoring units in GHMC limits. Currently, PCB is not doing pollution mapping. We have staff crunch issues. We have plans to work on these lines in the near future.”
 
 Geomapping and data expert Srinivas Kodali told TOI: “The initiative by Lakeer is a welcome move. This will help understand pollution patterns. But it has to be more scientific as more data will reflect the correct picture.”
