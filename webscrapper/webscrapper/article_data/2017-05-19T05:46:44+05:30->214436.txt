BHOPAL: The deadlock between the authorities of   health Limited and 108 Ambulance   continues, as the former failed to show up at a meeting with   (NHM) on Wednesday. 

 The 108 Ambulance spokesperson Aslam Khan said, "We were supposed to meet authorities of ZHL and NHM, but no one from ZHL bothered to attend the meeting. Since they were not present, even our delegates were not allowed to put forth our demands.   secretary of health   and managing director of MP NHM V Kiran Gopal held the meeting in our absence and said that they had would sort out the matter with ZHL soon."
 
 He said, "When health minister Rustam Singh had announced that the employers should pay us overtime for the extra four hours we put in, why are they not abiding by his words? I sense some sort of corruption in this matter. They are only dragging us from one department to another uselessly." The employees said that they were ready to join their duties as they were aware that health services were getting affected, but ZHL had not handed over keys of the ambulances to them without getting their signatures on the contract issued by it. 
 
 However, CFO (ZHL)   said, "We were not aware about Wednesday meeting, and hence we could not participate in." Meanwhile, the decision of the high court regarding the four demands that the 108 employees have put forth is likely to come today.
