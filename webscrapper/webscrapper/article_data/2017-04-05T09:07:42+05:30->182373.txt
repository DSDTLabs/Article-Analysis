BENGALURU: Cricket fanatics from the city are waiting with bated breath to witness the opening ceremony of the 10th edition of the   (IPL), set to kick off at Uppal's   International Stadium, on Wednesday. The ceremony will have a host of special programmes, including a performance by Btown actress Amy Jackson.Adding to their excitement is the first match of the 20-20 tournament that'll see home team Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) -also the defending champions -clash with arch rivals   (RCB).

 No surprises then that tickets for the first day first show sold out in no time, both over the counter and through online website, leaving those waking up at the last minute thoroughly disappointed.
 
 “I spent over five hours on Tuesday trying to buy some tickets, but to no avail. Everything is sold out,“ said a dejected sports enthusiast Dheerendra Vishwamitra. His attempt to book tickets at the Saroor Nagar Indoor Stadium too did not yield any positive result. While some coughed up to `5,000 to grab a seat at the stadium, a few not-so-lucky others made peace with buying their team's merchandise and decided to cheer for them from the comfort of their homes or eateries. “We wanted to book 10 tickets but failed as our leave was approved in the last minute. So we have decided to wear SRH t-shirts and cheer our team from a city eatery,“ said Vishnu Vardhan, an   employee.
 
 The police authorities, meanwhile, assured spectators of a smooth entry into the stadium on Wednesday . “The police has taken all the precautions -such as allotment of parking places, diversion points, installing signages and boards -to prevent traffic jams,“ said N Divyacharan Rao, additional DCP (traffic) of Rachakonda.
