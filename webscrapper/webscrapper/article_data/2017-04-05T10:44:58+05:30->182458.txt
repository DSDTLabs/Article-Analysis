Two men were questioning her, and she could be heard confessing that she had earlier stolen money and a mobile phone from the area.
 
 A police constable was also seen entering the scene; sources said he later took the woman to Virar police station.

 “We had earlier produced her in front of the magistrate to sign a bond in a similar case, but she continues with her ways,” said Younis Shaikh, senior inspector, Virar police station. He also said that since no one had come forward to register an FIR, the woman was asked to leave. Sources said she lives in a slum in Virar (East) and is a small-time thief.
 
 But the Virar cops failed to record her complaint for the humiliation and beating she had suffered at the hands of the mob, despite the existence of clear video proof.
