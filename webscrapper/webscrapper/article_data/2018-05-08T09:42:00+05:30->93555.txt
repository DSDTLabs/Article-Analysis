LUCKNOW: Former principal of BRD Medical College, Dr  , who has been lodged in   jail for the last eight months after 30 children died in August 2017, is currently undergoing treatment at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) in the state capital.

 
 The bail plea of Dr  , a patient of liver cirrhosis, had been turned down by the Allahabad high court a week ago. Since Dr Mishra’s health condition was unstable in jail, he was referred to the Lohia Hospital on Saturday.
 
 RMLIMS director Prof Deepak Malviya said, “He is recuperating at the institute. He is suffering from liver cirrhosis and so his health gets affected often. We have kept him under observation and decision to discharge him will be taken after a health review perhaps in two or three days.”
 
 The Allahabad high court had on May 1rejected the bail plea of Dr Mishra, one of the nine accused in the death of several children due to alleged disruption in oxygen supply at the hospital last year.
 
 Dr Mishra has been charged under sections 409 (criminal conspiracy), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and 120B of the IPC besides section 7/13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Dr Mishra’s wife,  , a co-accused in the case, is also currently lodged in Gorakhpur jail. The high court on Monday turned down the bail plea of Dr Purnima Shukla.
 
 While the doctor couple has been denied bail, two other accused in the case,   and Dr Kafeel Khan, have been granted bail by the   and Allahabad high court, respectively.
