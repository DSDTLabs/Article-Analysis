NAGPUR: Two poachers involved in removing body parts of tigers from  , were on Tuesday seen sharing dais with local   leader Shanta Kumre from Deolapar. They escaped when forest teams zeroed in on them.

 One of them Manraj Inwate is sitting panchayat samiti member and was involved in chopping paws of a tiger found dead inside Pench. Similarly, 73 tiger whiskers were seized from Rajaram  , former zilla parishad member. Nagpur Bench of Bombay High Court has rejected their anticipatory bail.
 
 On Tuesday, Paoni RFO Pandurang   and his team tried to nab them after receiving specific intelligence inputs that tribal department was holding a programme at tribal school in Kolitmara and absconding accused Inwate and Kodwate were sharing dais with Kumre, a sitting ZP member, and others.
 
 “When the accused saw forest officials, they ran away from the venue and hid inside a house inside the village. The villagers blocked the forest team and started abusing them,” said forest sources. However, Kumre intervened and assured the foresters that she will make them surrender by April 5. This shows Kumre is backing the accused.
 
 Sensing trouble, forest teams including Pakhle and Sachin Jadhav, RFO of Nagalwadi, and other staff retreated. A team led by Pakhale had nabbed one absconding tiger case accused   last month. There are still 15 accused whose bail have been rejected and who are absconding. “The efforts to arrest the absconding accused will be intensified soon,” said Pench field director RS Govekar.
 
 A couple of months’s ago, HC had rejected anticipatory bail of Chandrakala Varathi, sister of accused Inwate, who had obstructed forest team that had gone to arrest him.
