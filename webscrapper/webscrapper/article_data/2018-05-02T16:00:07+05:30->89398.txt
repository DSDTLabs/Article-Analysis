Heavy rainfall in Guntur and Krishna districts on Tuesday exposed the construction quality of the   secretariat building on Tuesday. 

 
 The rain that continued for around 30 minutes flooded the premises of the AP secretariat in Velagapudi. 
 
  
  
 The seepage through ceiling and walls is continuing to haunt the chamber of Opposition leader YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in the AP Secretariat complex. The housekeeping staff of the secretariat rushed to Reddyâ€™s chamber and mopped the floor. Waiting Hall near Secretariat Gate-2 also witnessed seepage.
 
 Last year also, Jagan's chamber faced the same fate during rainy season. After several protests from YSRCP, the Speaker ordered an inquiry into the matter. However, the inquiry committee closed the issue by giving a report stating water leakage had been caused by pipes which were cut.
 
 Participating in a debate on the matter in secreteriat, TDP leader   said water entered the room because of an open window. Narayanamurthy said that it is happening in every minister's chamber.
 
 AP secratariat staff was not in their offices as it was May 1. So there wasn't much inconvenience to the staff. But many are commenting on the construction quality of AP secretariat after this incident.
