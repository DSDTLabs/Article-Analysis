Calangute: With the Congress declaring Joseph Sequeira as its candidate from Calangute on Sunday, the pace of political activity in the tourism hub picked up on Monday. Bharat Janata Party’s (BJP) Michael Lobo filed his nominations from Calangute constituency on Monday.  While members of the Calangtue panchayat back Sequeira, Lobo has found some strong support in Candolim. Sarpanch Sandra Fialho, representing Candolim panchayat, which was a stronghold and homeground of former Congress MLA Agnelo Fernandes, was present with Lobo, as he filed his nomination papers. Also present with Lobo were Parra sarpanch Delilah Lobo and Arpora-Nagoa sarpanch Reshma Kalangutkar. It is unclear whether Fernandes, who was also lobbying for the Congress ticket, would support Sequeira, with whom he had a bitter rivalry in the past, having twice defeated him in the assembly elections. When contacted, Fernandes said, “As a loyal Congressman, I expected the ticket, but they have given it to someone who was threatening to contest against the party, if he wasn’t given the Congress ticket. With regards to my support in the future, I have to discuss the matter with my supporters, who are unhappy that I haven’t got the Congress ticket. I will decide in a day or two whether to support Sequeira,” he said. Most of the panchayat members from Parra, Arpora-Nagoa and Candolim, which constitute Calangute constituency, have sworn their support to Lobo. Beach shack owners and tourist taxi unions have also extended their support to Lobo. Lobo is confident that developmental works such as the garbage treatment plant, sewerage system, widened roads, etc, will work in his favour, while Sequeira is hoping to translate the recent discontent over the delay in shack licences and demonetization into a favourable wave for him. Sequeira said he would be filing his nomination papers either on Tuesday or Wednesday.
