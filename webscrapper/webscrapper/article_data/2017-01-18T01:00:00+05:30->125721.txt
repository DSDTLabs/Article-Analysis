Actor  , who will soon be seen in the TV show 'Prem Ya Paheli... Chandrakanta', will tie the knot by the end of this year. And, like many men before him, love found a way to Abhishek’s heart through his stomach. About his girlfriend  , he says, “She cooks amazingly well. I can apologise to her even without committing any mistake just for that. In fact, I would like her to do an international chef course.”
The two have been in a relationship for the past two years. “Our families have met and are planning our roka in a few days. We will tie the knot by the end of this year,” he says, adding, “She is the kind of girl I have always wanted to marry. After being at wrong places, God has finally landed me at the right one.”
 Considering the fact that Ankita is younger than him by nine years, was it difficult to connect with her? “Not at all. Being an actor, I get to work with people across age groups and I get along with everyone,” says the actor.
 Ask him about his failed relationships with   and Kalpana Sonawane and he replies, “My past doesn’t matter anymore. I am superstitious and don’t want to jinx my beautiful present with Ankita.”
 Along with his personal life, Abhishek’s professional life is looking up, too. “'Chandrakanta' will be my first costume drama. I am excited about being part of a legendary show, which I have watched as a child. I will play Kroor Singh’s aide Ahmed. Though negative, he is a comic character,” he signs off.
