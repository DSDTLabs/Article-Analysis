THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   has issued an order   the conduct of vacation classes in schools in the state. If at all a vacation camp is organized, it should last only for a week, said a circular issued to the heads of schools in the state.

 The order is applicable to all schools in state, including those following   and ICSE boards. As per Kerala Education Rules (KER), the 2017-18 academic year ends on March 31, and schools must be closed for summer holidays. However, it has come to the notice of the department that certain schools are gearing up for classes during the vacation period.
 
 
 Last year, the state commission for protection of child rights had issued instructions to the   department banning summer classes after many schools were found to be holding such classes.
 
 
 This year too, the commission has received several complaints over certain schools conducting classes during summer. Pointing out that summer holidays are an essential break for children for their   well-being, the commission directed the department to ban such classes.
 
 
 The circular has warned that strict action would be taken against school authorities, principals and teachers who are responsible for conducting the classes. These people would be made responsible if students face heat-related illness. The circular has urged all district-level education officers to conduct inspections in schools which are reported to be conducting summer classes, and initiate action against the school authorities.
