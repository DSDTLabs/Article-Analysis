BENGALURU: The Congress high command has reportedly asked chief minister   to be “cautious“ and “exercise restraint on sensitive issues“ like having a state flag.

 AICC general secretary (in charge of Karnataka)   held a closed-door meeting with Siddaramaiah here on Friday and reportedly sought clarification on the issue before conveying it to the high command.
 
 The CM was told to be cautious on  , particularly when assembly elections were round the corner.
 
 Defending the government decision, the CM is said to have told Venugopal there was a demand from Kannada organizations and writers to have a flag for the state. However, not yielding to their demand immediately, he had instead constituted a committee to look into the issue.
 
 With the Congress high command expressing reservations on the flag, it remains to be seen if Siddaramaiah will pursue the issue after the panel submits its report.
