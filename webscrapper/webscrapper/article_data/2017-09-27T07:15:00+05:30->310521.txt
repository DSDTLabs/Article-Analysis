GURUGRAM: Soon, health cards will be provided to all  . The card holders will be able to avail free medical tests in government hospitals. This new provision will benefit around 2.5 crore people. Notably, the services will be made available at your doorstep.

 Under this scheme, all   will be given health cards which would entitle them to around 35 free medical tests in the government hospitals. The decision was made in a meeting headed by state health minister   last week. The district government hospitals will provide health vans in their areas where residents can get various blood tests done.
 
 The state will be divided in four to five zones, and separate agencies will be hired to conduct a survey. The data will include details such as name, age, addresses, health records, etc. This database will also be available online.
