CHANDIGARH: The Haryana government on Tuesday ordered suspension of Hisar deputy   Paramjit Singh with immediate effect. Confirming this, minister of state for labour and employment Nayab Singh said Paramjit remained absent from the Building and Construction Workers’   held at Dabwali in Sirsa district, on March 26. 

 He had also disobeyed direct orders, besides   in his duties, Nayab said, adding that the work of the department related directly to the workers. “Therefore, absence of the officer concerned in an awareness conference organized for them reflected negligence on his part, especially in view of the minister being present at that meeting.
 
 Instructions have been issued to all officers and other employees to discharge their duties with dedication and honesty. Strict action would be taken under the rules against those who are found lax in their duties,” he said. During the suspension period, he would be posted in the office of the labour commissioner at Chandigarh.
