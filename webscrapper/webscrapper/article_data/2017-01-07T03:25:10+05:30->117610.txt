NEW DELHI: While sanitation workers of the East Delhi Municipal   struck work on Friday to protest the non-payment of salary for almost three months, trouble looms over the civic body in north Delhi too. The safai karamcharis of the North Corporation, who too have not received their salaries since November, are mulling a similar strike.

 Rajendra Mewati, president of Dilli Pradesh Safai Mazdur Union, warned on Friday that employees in the north would soon join the strike started by the   workers. 
 
 “We are calling a meeting of the United Front of MCD employees on Monday to discuss this. It is almost certain that in the joint meeting, all teachers, doctors and sanitation workers will support our just cause.” 
 
 Admitting that the situation in the North Corporation wasn’t as bad as in the east civic body,  , president of MCD Swacch Karamchari Union, nevertheless asserted, “Our brothers and sisters in the north will join our strike soon. They are in regular contact with us and in solidarity with our cause.” With shouts of “mazdoor ekta zindabad” ringing around, Gahlot indicated at a total breakdown in the two corporations in next few days. 
 
 Apprehensive of the protest spilling into north Delhi, a delegation of senior functionaries of the North Corporation, including mayor Dr   and standing committee chairman Pravesh Wahi, met lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Friday. The LG assured them he would take a serious look at the matter. However, Baijal also asked the civic officials to take steps to ensure efficient tax collection to make the corporation self-dependent. The North Corporation currently has an annual income shortfall of Rs 3,610 crore.
 
 The hints of a civic crisis in north Delhi are already there.  , president of CA Block Shalimar Bagh RWA in north-west Delhi, said on Friday, “We have been told by the workers that the dhalao-clearing would stop in the coming days.”
