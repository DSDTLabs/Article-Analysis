MUMBAI: Dinesh  , the victim of Thursday’s tree crash in  , has left behind a wife and two small daughters,   (9) and   (4).

 Sangle, who owned a photocopy shop at  , would come home for lunch around 3.30pm every day. Fighting back tears, Divya, his wife, said on Friday, “He would leave home in the morning, around 9.15am. It was routine for us that he would come back and we would have our lunch together. On Thursday, when he did not return, I kept calling him on his phone, but there was no response. Later, I got a call from a police officer who said my husband felt giddy and was in KEM Hospital.”
 
 When Divya reached the hospital, she learnt the truth. Sangle made around Rs 20,000 a month. Divya works as a maid and makes a tenth of the amount her husband earned. The daughters are yet to come to terms with the fact that their father is no more. “They keep asking about him,” said Kishore Malusare, a relative. “We are now worried about the girls’ education. The family no longer has the financial wherewithal to ensure that the girls are sent to a good school. With this tragedy, do we now have to enroll them to a municipal school?”
 
 The Sangles were all set to leave for Mangaon, their native place, next month. “Our tickets were booked. Just two days ago, we also bought new clothes for our daughters,” said Divya.
