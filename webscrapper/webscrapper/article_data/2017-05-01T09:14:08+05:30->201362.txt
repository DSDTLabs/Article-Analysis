 It has been over three months since CBI filed a voluminous chargesheet against former liquor baron  . However, Mallya’s lawyers have not been able to peruse the mountain of ‘evidence’ produced by CBI against Mallya. For, the chargesheet is over 15,000 pages.

    national president   intervened for the first time in January to arrest the factional fight in party’s Karnataka unit. He suggested a mechanism, but party’s minders from Delhi couldn’t ensure compliance. Once again, the factional feud became a public spectacle with either side — state unit chief BS Yeddyurappa and ex-Karnataka BJP chief Eashwarappa —giving vent to their feelings. This time, too, party general secretary in-charge of Karnataka,  , was unable to restrain them. In fact, on the day of public display of factionalism, Rao was in Arunachal Pradesh. Incidentally, both functions in Arunachal and Karnataka were pre-scheduled, but Rao chose one over the other. BJP is now ‘concerned’.
  
  
 
  The buzz about a senior   leader joining BJP, it seemed, was spread by the leader himself and that too at a time when he was on a vacation. Hence, the party was unable to give an official denial until they were finally able to contact him. Congress insiders say the leader spread the story to bag a plum designation in one of the parliamentary committees. So much for loyalty!
