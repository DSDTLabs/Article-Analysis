AHMEDABAD: An interactive discussion on   of   will be hosted at   (AMA) in the city on Wednesday. Mukesh Patel, an eminent tax guru, will be one of the main speakers. Director general of income tax (systems), Harish Kumar, will deliver the keynote address.

 “We’ve known about e-filing and e-processing of tax returns. Now e-assessment will be implemented with effect from the coming financial year,” Patel said. “This will do away with the manual procedure involving issuing of notice and meeting IT officials and responding to their queries. The personal interface between the officer and the taxpayer will be replaced by electronic communication.”
 
 There are immense benefits of such a system, Patel said. “It will ensure greater transparency as there is no human interface,” he said. “The system will promote accountability and efficiency. The discussion will elaborate on the roadmap on how the system will operate. Harish Kumar will highlight this.”
 
 The event is being organized by AMA, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce & Industry, All India Federation of Tax Practitioners, All Gujarat Federation of Tax Consultants, Income-Tax Bar Association, Chartered Accountants’ Association, ICAI Ahmedabad branch and Tax Advocates Association, Gujarat.
 
 Taxpayers from Gujarat will also participate in the discussion. “Authorities of Centralized Processing Centre will talk about certain open forum issues as part of the discussion,” Patel said.
