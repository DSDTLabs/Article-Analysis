AHMEDABAD: Last year 57,482 Amdavadis were bitten by stray dogs, which is almost 3,908 more dog bites than were recorded last year. In January alone this year, 6,248 citizens were bitten. The canines are today the Ahmedabad’s fiercest street gangs and notorious stalkers. Their terror makes you tremble when venturing out to buy provisions, or heading to a tuition class, or when returning home from office at night.

 According to the 2011 dog census carried out by the   ( ), there are 2.16 lakh stray dogs within the city limits. 
  
  
 Four NGOs have been able to sterilize and vaccinate just 1.28 lakh dogs between 2013 and 2017. Ahmedabad today tops Gujarat’s stray dog population and ranks third in the country after Bangalore and Delhi.
 
 To understand the gravity of the problem, it is worth mentioning that a city like Delhi — which has a human population of 1.9 crore — has a stray dog population of 2.62 lakh. 
 
 Ahmedabad has a human population of 60 lakh, just one-third of Delhi’s, but has a stray dog population of 2.16 lakh. Yet, only 19% of them have been sterilized over the past decade.
 
 The figures indicate how a stray dog lurks around every 28 Amdavadis and that one can encounter a stray dog every 25 metres. “If officially, 10 years is what one requires to control the stray dog population, Ahmedabad has suffered,” said a senior AMC official. 
 
 “In 2007 and 2008, only 218 dogs and 800 dogs were sterilized. This provided enough room for the dogs to procreate and multiply unchecked.”
