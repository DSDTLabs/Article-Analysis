NEW DELHI: South Delhi Municipal Corporation on Thursday decided to hand over seven of its multilevel   to Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) to ensure that the facilities are utilised.

 “The multilevel   are being given to DIMTS as they have expertise in this field. The agency will deploy its own manpower and equipment to run the facilities, while the corporation will pay the electricity bills and maintain it,” said Shailendra Singh, standing committee chairman. “Surface   costs Rs 20 per hour, so we have decided to charge Rs 10 per hour at the multilevel parking facility,” he added.
 
 The seven parking lots can accommodate nearly 2,300 vehicles and can help reduce illegal parking on the roads. While only one multilevel facility at Hauz Khas is currently functional, leader of the House Subhash Arya claims the other six will be ready by the end of the month.
 
 The multilevel facility at Hauz Khas was inaugurated officially thrice, but it is lying vacant due to the illegal surface parking in the area. 
 
 Last year, SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel had increased the rate of surface parking from Rs 20 to Rs 100 to ensure visitors use the multilevel facility, but the order was revoked.
 
 The multilevel parking lots at Kalkaji and New Friends Colony were completed in June 2016, but remain locked. The one at Munirka was ready by January last year, but remains empty and has become home to stray dogs and drug addicts. Contractors at the Rajouri Garden facility claim it will take at least one year to finish the project.
