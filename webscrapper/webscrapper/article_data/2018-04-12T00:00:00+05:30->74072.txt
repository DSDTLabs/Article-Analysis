Director Prashant Raj’s film this week,  , is not a road movie, but the narrative involves a journey, which sees the protagonists —   and   — traverse across Karnataka. “We shot at multiple locations across Karnataka, especially in the north, which will be a visual treat for audiences. The story is such that the lead pair decide to take off on a trip and what transpires thereafter forms much of the narrative. The timing of our shoot in   was during the hot weather, which was rather harsh on Prem and Kriti. In fact, Kriti almost had sunburns on some days. They also struggled with the cuisine, as both were on diets, which were far-fetched from what was locally available. Yet they were both sporting and managed during this schedule,” says Prashant.
