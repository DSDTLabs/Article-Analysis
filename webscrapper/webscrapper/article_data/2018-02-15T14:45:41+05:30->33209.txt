PANAJI:   who were absent and could not be administered   tablets on February 10 will receive them on Thursday.

 Thursday has been selected as the ‘mop up’ day, to ensure that no child is left out. 
 
 Students from pre-primary right up to Class XII (age 1-19 years), studying in government, aided and a few private schools, were each given the de-worming tablets for parasitic intestinal worms, under the ministry of health and family welfare national deworming programme on Saturday.
 
 Children below the age of two are given half a tablet, while those between the age of two to nine are given one tablet. In government and aided schools, teachers have been giving the students the chewable tablet on a full  , after interval. Some schools have also been giving the students the tablets to take home.
 
 The programme aims to improve the health and well-being of preschool and school children by reducing the   (STH) infections through mass deworming and other preventive measures. The Soil Transmitted Helminths prevalence for the state is 42%.
 
 While the parents of students studying in private schools turn down the offer of the tablet, government and aided schools don’t find much resistance to the programme.
 
 “We speak about the programme during the general body meeting of the   and ask the parents who have any objections to send us a letter,” one principal of an aided school said.
 
 In other schools, parents are asked to give their consent in the students’ diaries before each biannual deworming drive. Some schools also send in formal consent forms to be signed by parents.
