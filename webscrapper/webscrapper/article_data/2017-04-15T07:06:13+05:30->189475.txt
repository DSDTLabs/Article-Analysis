SURAT: A three-year-old girl was raped by a 13-year-old boy studying in class VI in   area of the city on April 11. 

 The boy was caught and produced before a juvenile court here on Friday after the girl’s parents registered a police complaint against him. 
 
 Police said the boy used to take the girl out to play with her daily. 
 
 The girl’s father is a daily wage labourer while the boy’s father is a carpenter and the two families are neighbours in a building.

 A police officer said, “We have subjected the boy and the girl to medical examination. The boy was presented before a juvenile court on Friday evening.
