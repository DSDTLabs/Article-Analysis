 Following the Supreme Court’s relaxation of its order on banning all liquor shops on highways, the cabinet discussed the issue of regulating liquor sales. “Many hotels and pubs on arterial roads passing through municipal limits of Tamil Nadu cities and towns wanted the government to de-notify arterial roads as those maintained by local bodies, instead of highways. 
 
 The issue figured in the cabinet. State home secretary   attended the meeting,” said the official. Apart from the state ministers, chief secretary   was present in the meeting.
