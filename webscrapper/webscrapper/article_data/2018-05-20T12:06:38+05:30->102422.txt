The last week of promotion is generally crucial for any film. For John Abraham’s ‘Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran’, it’s a little more than that. The actor received a clearance from the   on May 10 to release the film on its appointed date, May 25. With less than two weeks on hand, the actor is not leaving a stone unturned to reach out to his prospective audience.

 And guess who seems to have extended support to the actor-producer in this hour? Filmmaker  , high on the success of his last co-production ‘Raazi’ (backed by Junglee Pictures), invited John for a meeting at a suburban address on Friday night. John, who has previously worked in Karan’s productions, including the cult ‘Dostana’, was quite happy about the gesture.
 
 “John had been meaning to meet   for a while now but he couldn’t do in recent days because he shoots his film ‘Satyamev Jayate’ in the night and works on ‘Parmanu…’ promotions in the day. On Friday, everything worked out well and John wrapped work just in time to go across and meet Karan. They sat together for a while, talking about work and catching up in general. Karan also showed immense concern for ‘Parmanu…’ which put a smile on John’s face,” says a source close to the actor.
