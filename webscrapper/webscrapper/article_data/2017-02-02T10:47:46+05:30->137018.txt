The city can hope to gain from Union finance minister  's announcement of making major investment in infrastructure development for major cities in India. After an analytical studies of the Union budget, a section of the KMC officials is gearing up to send some major infrastructure projects to the Centre under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). If funds are available, these projects when implemented would change the face of the city , a civic official said.

 Sewerage rejuvenation and upgrade:The KMC had in 2009 undertaken a massive overhaul of the city's underground sewerage network. Some of the roads which were brought under the Rs 500 crore   national   (JNNURM) include Rashbehari Avenue, Vivekananda Road, APC Roy Road, AJC Bose Road (parts). The KMC top brass now wants to submit another major sewerage revamp project under AMRUT. This project aims at cleaning heavily silted trunk (major) sewerage lines from Sealdah station to Palmerbazar drainage pumping station. For this the KMC needs to spend Rs 400 crore.“We will send the project under the AMRUT to the Centre. If funds are approved, we have to engage a consultant and begin the work before this monsoon,“ said a KMC sewerage and drainage department official.
 
 Water supply upgrade programme: The KMC water supply department has drafted an integration plan to connect the city's two major water treatment plants -Palta waterworks and Garden Reach water treatment plant. Currently, the Palta water treatment plant in   supplies water till Park Circus area. According to a KMC water supply department official, under the Rs 500 crore project, if an underground water pipeline is laid from Park Circus to Behala via EM Bypass and along Tolly's Nullah, the entire city would benefit from this project.
