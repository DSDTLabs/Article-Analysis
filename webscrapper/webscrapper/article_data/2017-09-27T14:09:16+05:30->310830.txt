KOCHI: Despite the formation of   (CHZCS), many heritage structures in Kochi continue to be in a state of neglect.

 “The society was formed to coordinate all the departments who have a stake in heritage protection. However, not even a single meeting has been convened so far. The government has role in the destruction of many heritage sites here through various unnecessary projects in the name of development,“ said  , member of the commission and former Kochi mayor.
 
 While structures of historical importance like Bastion Bungalow and   at  , which are popular owing to its old architectural styles and mode of construction, are renovated using modern construction materials, thereby destroying its historical value.Warehouses in  , Dutch cemetery are getting dilapidated due to neglect.
 
 “Heritage structures like Chinese fishing nets which have been in use for over 500 years here are iconic images of   tourism. However, the authentic wooden structures are replaced with steel ones, draining it off its historical relevance. Many of the fishing nets are now positioned on land and have become obsolete too,“ said M P Sivadattan, director of Homestay and Tou rism Society and member of CHZCS.
 
 Leasing out of such buildings has proved to be damaging for the structures with lessees modifying them to suit their needs. Many old warehouses in Mattancherry have been leased out by residents who in turn rent them out to migrant labourers.
 
 “Structures that are hundreds of years old are given up for private ownership on lease and are destroyed over time. Such edifices cannot be maintained with the help of authorities alone. The locals should also be given a role in preservation of the same, after due awareness campaigns,“ said  , historian and former director general of Centre for Heritage Studies.
