NEW DELHI:   forced repeated adjournments in   on Wednesday to protest against the “murder of democracy” and “stealing of mandate” in Goa and Manipur, where it was not invited to form the government despite emerging as the single largest party in the assembly polls.

 Citing two judgments by constitution benches of the Supreme Court, Congress leader Anand Sharma said it was incumbent on the governor to first invite the single largest party to form the government and allow it to prove its majority in the event of no one getting a clear majority. 
 
 Instead, the Union government and   “turned it upside down to violate the mandate”, he said.
 
 In response, leader of the House   said, “It was a hung assembly in Goa and Manipur and it is natural that no one party has a simple majority. 
 
 It is clear that there were two options for the governor who could either call the single largest party or a minority-led alternative alliance which had the magic figures.”
 
 Jaitley referred to the SC decisions and said it had rejected the Congress plea and said it would take two minutes if Congress proved it had the numbers. 
 
 He said Congress did not even claim to form the government in Goa. “It is the principle of democracy to form the government of parties touching the magic figure.”
 
 He cited the example of Jharkhand’s hung assembly in 2005 where JMM was called by the governor to form the government with Congress’s support though BJP was the single largest party.
 
 Leader of opposition   said, “We have to raise our voice at the way the central government is propping up state governments without majority. This is murder of democracy... they have made a mockery of the Supreme Court judgments.”
 
 CPM’s   noted that President Shankar Dayal Sharma in 1996 had first invited A B Vajpayee to form the government, which lasted just 13 days, as BJP had emerged as the single largest party.
