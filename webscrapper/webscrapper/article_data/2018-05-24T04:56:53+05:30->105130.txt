BENGALURU: Hours before chief minister   and deputy CM   took oath, UPA chairperson   and   president   told their MLAs to stay united against “anti-democratic and communal forces” and ensure that the coalition government in Karnataka is not disturbed at any cost.

 
 Accompanied by   leader Mallikarjuna M Kharge and former chief minister Siddaramaiah, Sonia and Rahul met the 78 newly-elected Congress MLAs at a five star hotel where the lawmakers have been lodged.
 
 According to sources, the Congress leaders lauded the MLAs for resisting the temptations BJP offered to defect. A Congress leader quoted Sonia as having said during the meeting that the political scenario in the country is fast changing and it was imperative for them to join hands with like-minded parties like JD(S) and remain united to fight the common enemy. 
 
 “Sonia and Rahul told the legislators that Congress was not aligning with JD(S) for power, but for restoring democratic values,” a senior party leader privy to the conversation said.
 
 The MLAs, the leader said, appeared buoyant after the meeting and posed for a group photograph with their top leaders. While Sonia left early, Rahul stayed back, interacting with the MLAs and listening to their experiences at the resort, the sources said.
