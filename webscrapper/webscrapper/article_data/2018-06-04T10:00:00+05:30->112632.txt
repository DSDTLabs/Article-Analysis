It was a starry night, literally. Theatre lovers of the city gathered at a south Kolkata auditorium where Kaushik Sen’s much-awaited play   premiered on Tuesday. Based on Srijato’s novel Tarabhora Akasher Niche, the play features Anjan Dutt, Riddhi Sen, Reshmi Sen, Surangana Bandyopadhyay and others. 

  
 “Taraye Taraye, for me, is an emotional and a personal journey. And that’s why I was a little apprehensive on whether I will be able to connect with the audience. But the response is overwhelming. We are really happy. Also, just before the show, Anjanda asked one of our team members to read out a letter that he wrote for us. It was extremely emotional for all of us to go through his journey with us,” Kaushik told us.
 
  
 Meanwhile  , who was spotted enjoying the show, said, “I really liked the way Kaushik has adapted the play. My novel is a huge one and the play is of one-and-a-half hours. Kaushik’s inputs in the play are really interesting. In fact, I would say, Taraye Taraye is a blend of my novel and Kaushik’s imagination. Anjanda is outstanding. I have seen him dwell in the character even in real life.” 
 
  
 Rajatava Dutta, who has a long association with  , said, “I was a part of the group and even after I left, I performed in their productions. I always try to watch their annual productions that are usually staged on their birthday. It was an amazing experience. Anjanda’s intense acting is breathtaking, so is Riddhi’s and others. Taraye Taraye is an amalgamation of many talents. Even though all of them are busy, I hope they manage time to stage the play so that theatre lovers can enjoy 
 the production.”
