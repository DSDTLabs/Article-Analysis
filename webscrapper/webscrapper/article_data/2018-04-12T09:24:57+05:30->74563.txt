SHIMLA: With the   government transferring 1,010 bighas to the government of India, now IIM, Sirmaur, is likely to have its permanent campus. At present, the IIM is functioning from a temporary campus since 2015.

 According to state government officials, the required land for the construction of a permanent campus has been transferred to the government of India and now the Centre has to take a decision to start the construction activity. All funds for the construction of a permanent campus have to be provided by the Centre.
 
 On August 15, 2014, the then Himachal Pradesh chief minister,  , had announced the setting up of IIM campus at Dhaulakuan in Sirmaur district. Later, on March 12, 2015, a central committee had selected a site comprising 1,010 bighas at Dhaula Kuan near Nahan town for a permanent campus. The three-member central committee was headed by  , joint secretary, ministry of human resource development, along with prof  , director, IIM-Ahmedabad, and prof  , task force head from IIM-Lucknow, as the other two members. 
 
 Sources said that as the land belonged to the state agriculture department, there would be no requirement to seek clearances from the forest department under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. They further said that as construction of a permanent campus for the IIM in Sirmaur and central university has remained an issue in the state and parliamentary elections are due next year, there are chances that either Prime Minister   or Union human resource development minister Prakash Javdekar can come to lay the foundation stone of the premier business school before the elections.
