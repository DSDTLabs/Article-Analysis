The Keeping up with the Kardashians star   didn't mince any words while slamming people who are doling out unsolicited 'advice' after her beau Tristan Thompson was caught cheating. The reports surfaced just days before she gave birth to their daughter True.

 
 In her tweets, she made it very clear that she is in no mood to listen to anyone who claims to know that they know better.
 
 For the uninitiated, Tristan Thompson was seen kissing model   in a nightclub before reports of flings with several other women emerged just days before Khloe gave birth on April 12 this year. 
 
 Much to her fans' surprise, Khloe didn't pay much heed to the reports. She has been holed up in Cleveland, where Tristan is based, focusing on her baby girl and her fitness. 
 
 The 33-year-old reality star tweeted on Sunday (27th May, 2018): 'They love to give advice but are not living the advice that they are offering. Most of the ones giving advice are in no place to give anything at all.'
 
 She continued in the same vein: 'Focus on your own world. I’m sure there are cracks there that need your attention. We all got them.'
 
 The Keeping Up With The Kardashian star concluded with the tweet that read as: 'Misery loves company. People can't stand for someone else to flourish and be happy. Nowadays people thrive off one’s downfall rather than their success. Sadly.'
 
 She is clearly in no mood to lend an ear to anyone and is currently enjoying parenthood with Tristan.
