Pune: Automaker Volkswagen on Monday said it produced 1,45,145 cars in the country in 2016, a rise of 17% over the previous year when the carmaker produced 1,23,456 cars. 

 In terms of domestic sales,   also seems to have found its mojo back since July 2016, also coinciding with the launch of compact sedan Ameo. The company sold 10,966 Ameo’s between July and November, this year. Overall, the German automaker sold 42,975 units in January to November of 2016 against 40,585 units in the same period of 2015. 
 
 Last year, this time, VW was saddled with an emissions controversy that gripped it worldwide. The carmaker “voluntartily” recalled 3,23,700 diesel cars in India after testing agency the Automotive Research Agency of India reported to the department of heavy industry that the carmaker was emitting excess nitrogen oxide on road than in standard test conditions. “The shift towards petrol has majorly been due to the Indian market’s trend itself which has been observed across the industry,” said Andreas Lauermann, president and managing director, VW India.
 
 “In 2016, the plant has produced over 36,700 Polo cars, 15,400 Ameo cars (since the production started in May 2016), 83,300 Vento cars and 9,600 Rapid cars catering to the growing demand from the domestic as well as export market in addition to assembling the 1.5-litre TDI engine,” the carmaker said in a statement.
 
 The automaker made about 42% of the cars for sale in India and balance for exports.
