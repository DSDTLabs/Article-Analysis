ZIRAKPUR: After every two months,   resident Harish   has to get his car serviced and its wheels aligned. As roads around his residential society are maintained poorly and riddled with potholes, Lamba is not the only person in Dhakoli and Gazipur who has been making more-than-frequent trips for getting his car serviced. 

 According to locals, while roads at present are dusty and have tolerable potholes, the situation gets worse in monsoon, when these potholes are filled with water and motorists don't even know what they are driving on. During a visit to the two areas falling under Zirakpur municipal council, a team of The Times of India came to know that the road had not been repaired for more than a year, even after a number of reminders to the civic body.
 
 A resident of Zirakpur, S K Wadhawan, said residents faced a tough time when it rained recently. "While motorists still managed, imagine the plight of pedestrians: They had to walk on slush," he told The Times of India.
 
 Advocate Satbir Singh, another resident, said officials kept on giving assurances, but nothing was done on the ground. "It is our right to get a basic civic facility like road," he said.
 
 There are no traffic signals on the VIP road, making it next to impossible for motorists to move around during rush hour. The lack of discipline among motorists and lack of traffic cops adds to the chaos. Residents said traffic lights should be installed in the area along with speed breakers and dividers should also be installed on required junctions.
 
 Nikhil Mishra, a resident of   I, said the toughest time for people residing in areas around VIP Road was after 6.30pm. "Most of the time, I get stuck in traffic in the evening for at least half an hour. This gets worse in festive season. The civic body needs to get its act together," he said.
