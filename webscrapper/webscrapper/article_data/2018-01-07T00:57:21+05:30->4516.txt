Chennai: The Indian National League (INL) on Saturday dubbed the   an ‘ill-intentioned’ one brought by the   government. It has asked opposition parties to oppose it in Parliament. While appreciating the need to remove the practice, the INL demanded a proper scrutiny of the bill.

 INL’s state president Inayathullah told reporters here that if the BJP government’s intention was to ensure that   were granted their rights, Union law ministry could have called for a discussion with Muslim organisations and All India Muslim Personal Law Board soon after the Supreme Court verdict on talaq four months ago.
 
 In a press statement it said the BJP government was communalist and it had been targeting Muslims and dalits through direct and indirect means. “Some examples are the beef controversy, attack on dalits in BJP-ruled states and cancellation of subsidy to Haj pilgrims. As the BJP has realised that it will never get the support of Muslims, it has decided to destroy them.” 
 
 Inayathullah sought to clarify that triple talaq, as per the Sharia law, was not an instant utterance. “After the first talaq is pronounced, the man has to live with the wife for the next three menstrual cycles. If within that period the couple reconcile the differences, the man may continue to live with the wife,” said Inayathullah.
 
 INL said uneducated Muslim men were not aware of this. “Jailing Muslim men for their ignorance is an unacceptable act. It will lead to the destruction of the Muslim community. The wife will be left to fend for herself if the husband is jailed. Muslim families will be economically and socially disadvantaged.”
