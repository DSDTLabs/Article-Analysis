HYDERABAD: In view of heightened threat perception to chief minister  , the intelligence wing of the state police department has decided to enhance his security.

 A senior police officer said   henceforth will be guarded by 18 commandos trained by Greyhounds, the elite anti-Naxal outfit. The commandos will form the core of the security of the CM.
 
 As of now, the ubiquitous safari-clad personnel, trained by the   (ISW), have been part of the chief minister's security. The ISW, a part of the state Intelligence wing, is responsible for the security of those holding constitutional positions and other VVIPs.
 
 Apart from the ISW personnel, an elite team of commandos will form a ring around the CM. A fleet of mine-proof   vehicles form part of KCR's convoy .
 
 Though officials claimed there is no serious threat to the chief minister from any quarters, they do not want to take any chances. â€œThe latest move to enhance security of the CM has got nothing to do with any imminent threat, it has been done as part of a more professional approach by upgrading skills,'' a senior police officer told  .
 
 Though the influence of CPI (Maoist) in the sta te is almost insignificant, still the chief minister could be their target. Apart from that, the Threat Perception Report (TPR) is periodically reviewed by intelligence authorities considering the threat from political opponents, extremists like Maoists and other outlawed forces.
