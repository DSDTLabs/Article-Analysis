NAGPUR:   diseases are infections that are transmitted between animals and humans. There is not much awareness about these diseases and their diagnosis. If not treated on time, they can affect the brain and also lead to mortality. 

 Researchers with GM Taori Central India Institute of Medical Sciences (CIIMS), along with  , have been working to develop diagnostic kits for various diseases like brucellosis, listeriosis, scrub typhus, brain TB, dengue, chikungunya etc. 
 
 “Our efforts for the last many years are bearing fruits now and are helping to create awareness and facilities for treatment of these diseases,” said Dr Lokendra Singh, director of CIIMS, during an interaction between researchers and clinicians on creating awareness about zoonotic/neuro infections and about advance diagnostic kits developed by CIIMS. 
 
 “The main aim of this interaction is to connect with maximum number of people who require treatment for diseases transmitted from animals to humans,” said Dr Singh. 
 
 The interaction was organized by CIIMS, in association with  , on Thursday.
 
 “We have tried to reach places in Central India where many farmers need tests for zoonotic diseases. If these diseases are not cured on time, the infection can reach the brain and cause death,” said Dr Rajpal Singh Kashyap, director research, CIIMS. 
 
 CIIMS researchers are working on-field in collaboration with the tribal health care centre for the last 8-10 years. They are in a process to establish a research centre at Melghat, a tribal region with high mortality rate and malnutrition cases. 
 
 Three brochures were released at the function. Dr Lokendra Singh, Dr Rajpal Singh Kashyap, Mohan Agarwal and Dr HF Daginawala released the leaflet on diagnosis of diseases. Zoonotic and research leaflets were released by Dr Singh, Dr Kashyap, Dr Chandrashekar Charm, Sunil Mansingh, Vinod Bajaj, Dr Sanjeevani Kelkar, Dr VS Agarwal and Dr Daginawala.
