PANAJI: The   (GMC) and Hospital is likely to start a   outpatient department from next week onwards.   has signed a memorandum of understating (MoU) with   hospital to enable it to see cancer patients in the GMC itself, before its full-fledged facility for treating cancer patients is set up in the hospital complex.

 While the latest statistics are not available about cancer cases, medical superintendent of GMC and hospital, Dr S M   said cancer cases are on the rise in Goa. “We don’t know what the reason is, but cancer cases are rising. We will start the cancer   from next week,” said Bandekar, adding that all formalities to make the OPD functional are being completed.
 
 Recently, health minister Vishwajit Rane announced the setting up of an oncology department under Dr   at GMC. The file was processed for setting up of a new department.
 
 About eight months ago, the state government signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the central government to set up a regional cancer centre at GMC. The Rs 100-crore project was approved more than a year ago, but wasn’t pursued by the state government until a few months ago. The central government has sanctioned Rs 45 crore for the project.
 
 A few months ago, Rane announced that he would see that GMC has a cancer centre set up so that patients from Goa don’t have to travel outside the state for treatment. Besides, the process is also under way to upgrade and improve the intensive care unit (ICU) facility of the state’s premier hospital. 
 
 The current strength of the ICU facility at GMC is 17 beds which they intend to increase to 25 beds. Bandekar said the guidelines are being finalised for the same.
 
 The process to put in use unused operation theaters (OTs) of the hospital are also under way.
