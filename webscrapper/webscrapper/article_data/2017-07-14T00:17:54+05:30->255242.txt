Kolhapur: Over 10,000 candidates will appear for the Teachers’ Eligibility   (TET) on July 22 in the city, informed district primary education officer Subhash Chougule on Thursday. He said the exam will be conducted for two papers — paper 1 and paper 2.

 “We have prepared some 31 centres across Kolhapur city. However, there are chances that number of centres may reduce to 20-21, as we are giving preference to the centres which can host both the papers. Many candidates for paper 1 are going to appear for paper 2. Hence, such arrangements,” he said, adding that students can download their hall tickets online till July 22.
 
 In a bid to improve the quality of teachers in the education field, the state government had decided to conduct the TET examination in the month of December 2013 for the very first time.
