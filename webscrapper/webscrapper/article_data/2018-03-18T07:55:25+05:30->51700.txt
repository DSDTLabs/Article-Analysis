CHANDIGARH: Yamunangar police on Saturday arrested a 17-year-old boy and his friend for allegedly raping a minor girl. The court sent the rape-accused boy to a juvenile home, while his friend was remanded to judicial custody.

 The case was registered on Friday evening, after a woman approached the police and reported her missing granddaughter. In her statement to police, the girl told cops that she had been staying with her grandmother for the past two years. She said she came in contact with a boy last year and was lured into a relationship with him. She said the boy, a minor, forced her into sex on the pretext of marriage but made her video and started blackmailing her. She said this went on for the past one year. 
 
 On March 15, she came to know that she was four weeks pregnant. She alleged that when she told her perpetrator about her pregnancy, he took her to his friend, who also outraged her modesty. She told this to her grandmother, who approached the police and a case was registered.
 
 “They had approached the Chhappar police station during late evening hours. Soon after registration of the case, we arrested the minor boy on Friday early morning and the other was arrested later in the day,” said   deputy superintendent of police  , who is the supervising officer in the case.
