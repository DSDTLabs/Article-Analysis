MUMBAI: An   was arrested on charges of rape after he shot an obscene video of a woman and blackmailed her into a physical relationship. Later, he forwarded the video to her husband when she stopped giving in to his demands. The accused, Sartaj Shaikh, was booked under section 376 of the IPC.

 “The woman was devastated when she approached us with a complaint four days ago. She was afraid her marriage would break. We took Shaikh into custody immediately," said a senior official at Malad police station.
 
 Shaikh (27) and the 26-year-old complainant have known each other for two years. They used to work together at a factory. After quitting his job, Shaikh began to drive rickshaws. He approached the woman as she owned a rickshaw and hired the vehicle from her. Three months ago, he called her up and complained that the auto had broken down. He sought her help.
 
 The woman, who lives in Bhayander, did not suspect anything amiss and went where Shaikh had called her. He offered her a soft drink laced with a sedative. After she passed out, he shot an obscene video of her. He later told her about the video and threatened to make it public.
 
 “Twice after that, Shaikh called the victim to hotels where she was raped," said a police official. “When she stopped giving in to his demands, he circulated the video and also sent it to her husband." That's when she rushed to the police.
 
 A case has been registered against Shaikh, the official said.
