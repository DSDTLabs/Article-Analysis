NEW DELHI: A man who dismantled and sold off   vehicles has been arrested. Zeeshan Pahwa would receive the   stolen from Delhi and sell off the parts at the infamous Sotiganj market in Meerut. He has apparently sold thousands of cars that way. 

 
 Pahwa’s factory was known as ‘mortuary’ among vehicle thieves, and he could “cut down” any car within an hour. Crime Branch officers believe the arrest is a major boost to their crackdown on automobile theft. A stolen XUV, a Verna and a Polo have been seized from his factory, police said. 
 
 Joint CP (crime) Alok Kumar said Pahwa has about 25 criminal cases of vehicle theft and tampering of engine or chassis numbers of vehicles registered in Delhi, Meerut, Gurgaon, Noida and Ghaziabad, and was declared a proclaimed offender by several courts. 
 
 A team led by DCP Bhisham Singh and ACP Aditya Gautam had been tracking Pahwa across Delhi and UP after it was learnt that some of the most notorious vehicle lifters arrested by Delhi Police were the regular customers of Pahwa.“A team finally tracked him   to Dwarka while he was fleeing with a stolen Polo. When he was intercepted, he tried to shoot at the police team. He was overpowered and nabbed,” said DCP Bhisham Singh. 
 
 Pahwa said he came from a middle-class family in Meerut and opened his own garage four years ago after working as a helper at several garages for about eight years. Initially he would only receive small cars, but lately he would only get bigger cars like Toyota Fortuners and Innovas. 
 
 Prices of the parts would vary going by the condition and model of the vehicle. Pahwa gave contracts to different gangs in Delhi. For this, he even provided duplicate keys. In the past few years, he received and sold over a thousand stolen cars, either as parts or intact to another receiver in Meerut.
