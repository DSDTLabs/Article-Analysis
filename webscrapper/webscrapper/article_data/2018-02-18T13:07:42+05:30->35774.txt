 has been in the works for over two years and now that the team has finally finished shooting, its lead actors   and   has started dubbing for the movie.

 The movie, which will mark the Mollywood debut of Siddharth also poses a unique challenge for the actor who is all game to tackle it head on. Kammarsambhavam’s director   had earlier told us that Siddharth would indeed dub in Malayalam for the movie, and based on the Tamil actor’s tweet, he has started the process.
 
 Siddharth had tweeted: “Love a language, she will love you back. Acting without your voice is at best a deceit! Starting dubbing for my toughest picture yet. Need your blessings and expectations. I am because I try! 3 year journey:) Thank you Rathish Ambat and Murali Gopy. #Malayalam #Kammarasambhavam.”
