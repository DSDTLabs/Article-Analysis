Vadodara: In a shocking revelation it came to light that less than half the number of students who qualify the PhD Entrance Test (PET) eventually get registered as PhD students at M S University. 

 Official data suggests that although the number of students who qualify for PhD after clearing their test is much high, when it comes to actual registrations the number of students who get ultimately registered for PhD programme is much low. 
 
 In academic year 2015-16, for instance, a total of 654 students had qualified for PhD. Against this, however, there were only 162 students who got registered for the PhD programme. 
 
 Similarly, only 155 students got registered for the PhD programme in 2016-17 – the academic year in which MSU had not organised the PET. 
 
 The data of 2017-18 suggests that a total of 569 students had qualified for PhD but eventually only 133 students took up the PhD programme. 
 
 The low conversion ratio is a matter of concern even amongst MSU authorities as number of PhDs that the university churns out directly impacts the research environment at the campus.
 
 “Many a times, students put in hard work to clear PET but eventually are discouraged by teachers who do not want to burden themselves with additional workload. It is this negative attitude of teachers which needs to be changed,” said an official.
