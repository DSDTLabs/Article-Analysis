 The PGIMER will have these new additional posts on the pattern of AIIMS New Delhi. Though at the moment, these doctors have not received any information officially. "I do not know about the selection yet," said Dr Rajwanshi.
 
 The objective of having separate deans for research and academics is to have focus on research and teaching. "We plan to enhance the research aspect of the institute as well. There are many patients who come to the hospital daily. Besides being a hospital, PGIMER is an educational and research centre as well," said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER. 
 
 However, there are some senior doctors who feel that these additional posts will not only enhance research activities, but would also help the director in sharing responsibilities. "Research does not depend on the top authority, but has to come from within. Also, the doctors are so much burdened with clinical work that it's not possible to give enough time to research," said a senior faculty.
