GUWAHATI: Some   in the city are still taking   from customers despite the district administration's strict instructions. 

 "I had to quarrel with the security staff at   in Bhangagarh. When I refused to pay parking fee, they tried to abuse me. I didn't pay but they were taking money from others," said Pranjal Deka, a government employee.
 
 Similar incidents are taking place in other areas as well. Anup Saikia, another shopper, had a similar experience a few days ago. "The staff at the Pantaloons charged parking fee for my two-wheeler. I think there is lack of awareness for which these shopping malls are still charging parking fee," said Saikia.
 
 The Kamrup (Metro) district administration has already instructed commercial establishments, hospitals and others to arrange for their own parking spaces. "We have taken it seriously and will ask the   (GMC) to be strict," said deputy commissioner M Angamuthu.
 
 Traffic DCP Amanjeet Kaur said it's illegal and strict action will be taken. "We have regulated commercial establishments, hospitals and shopping malls. Action will be taken against those establishments which charge parking fee. We also appeal to the public to report to us if they notice any kind of misdeeds," said Kaur. 
 
 The district administration has already raided several commercial establishments and issued notices for failing to meet the norms set by the GMC and the administration. 
 
 The residents feel the administration must conduct awareness campaigns so that people can lodge complaints.
