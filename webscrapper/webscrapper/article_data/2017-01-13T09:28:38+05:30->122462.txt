AHMEDABAD: Nikol police claim that Bhogilal   had orally agreed to hand over his land, near Nikol crossroads, for building a   to none other than inspector H J Chaudhary, but had later retracted. 

 Chaudhary was recently arrested for abetting the suicide of one of his own – a police constable.
 
 So, cops went ahead to build a chowky on Prajapati’s land, despite his protests, say sources, with Prajapati repeatedly urging them to stop construction.
 
 Three days ago, unable to contain his rage and frustration,   hired a JCB and razed the part of the police chowky built on his land. To Nikol cops this was unacceptable.
 
 A police team rushed to the spot, seized the JCB, and detained the driver forcing Prajapati to go to Nikol police station. “Senior police officials, despite their VGGS assignments, rushed to the spot, as the issue of building a police chowky on private land, without the owner’s consent, could have caused embarrassment,” said a source.
 
 But now things seem to be under control. Prajapati, who had first claimed that he had never permitted cops to build a chowky on his land, and who even went to the extent of razing the construction, has fallen silent after spending about five hours in the police station. Sources say the JCB and its driver were released only after Prajapati resigned to his fate and struck a compromise.
 
 Prajapati seems out of reach and couldn’t be contacted for further comment on the issue.
 
 C B Gamit, inspector, Nikol police station, said, “The chowky was under construction for a year, and the part of land where the incident took place belongs to Prajapati. However, we will now check land records with municipal authorities.” Gamit also mentioned that Prajapati had orally agreed earlier to inspector Chaudhary to give away his land to the police, but had retracted.
