Chennai: State-run electricity discom   has denied last week’s news reports which stated that lower grade imported coal was procured from Indonesia at a higher price last week. This was after Arappor Iyakkam, a Chennai-based   alleged that there was a Rs3,000 crore excess invoicing scam in the procurement, as the discom had paid a much higher price than the market value by playing around with the moisture specifications of the coal.

 For procurement of coal, Tangedco had set the specification of Gross Calorific Value (GCV) at 6,000 Kcal/kg on Air Dried Basis (ADB), which is equal to GCV of 5,500 Kcal/kg on Gross as Received (GAR) basis, which is the specification in which Indonesian coal is dealt. Using RTI information and their own calculations, the NGO had considered two scenarios of 5,500Kcal/kg and 5,700Kcal/kg on GAR basis to estimate the loss to exchequer between Rs1,700 crore and Rs3,025 crore.
 
 “In the news item, it is stated that coal with GCV of 6,000Kcal/Kg (on ADB) is procured at 6,000 GAR coal price, which is factually incorrect. 6,000ADB coal is procured by Tangeco by comparing with equivalent prices of 5,900 and 5,800 GAR coal after bringing prices equivalent to Tangedco’s 5,604 GAR (6,000 ADB) coal,” the statement from Tangeco read. They also stated that the price was finalised by comparing with international indices like Platts and Argus ICI2 index. “The   of the NGO which appeared in the media are totally false,” the statement said.
 
 When asked for a response to Tangedco’s rebuttal, Arappor convenor Jayaram Venkatesan said that Tangedco saying that the coal procured is of 5,604 GAR is ‘an indirect acceptance of the loss which would be in between these two scenarios the NGO had proposed’.
 
 They also demanded that the authorities publish a copy of the comparative statement with the market price that their technical committee approved during each of their bid based on which the procurement price was fixed.
