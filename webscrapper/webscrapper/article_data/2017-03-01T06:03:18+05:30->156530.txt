Mumbai: The   and NCP’s loss seems to be the Majlise Ittihadul Muslimeen’s gain in the polls for 10 municipal corporations in the state. Though MIM won just two seats in Mumbai and Thane, it performed well in Amravati and Solapur while opening accounts in Akola, Pune and Nagpur with one seat in each city. 

 In Amravati, where the   scored a zero and Congress won just 15 seats, MIM won 10 — three more than   did. In Solapur, MIM won 9 seats. “Our performance in Amravati and Solapur is reasonably good because of strong organizational set up in these cities. Muslims backed us overwhelmingly here because they were disillusioned with Congress and NCP,” said MIM’s Maharashtra president Syed Moin.
 
 That MIM opened its account in almost every corporation election it has fought since 2014, said MIM legislator Waris Pathan, showed the party had spread its footprints in Maharashtra. “Our acceptance is increasing among not just Muslims but dalits too,” said Pathan, adding that MIM had weaned away Muslims from the Congress.
