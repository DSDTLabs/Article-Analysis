Gandhinagar: Just a day after gangster Ravi Pujari’s threat calls to 10 Gujarat Congress MLAs was raised in the assembly, MLA from Kankrej, Dharshibhai Khanpura, too, claimed he had received threat call from Pujari. Leader of opposition, Shankersinh Vaghela had raised the issue of Pujari’s threat calls on Tuesday.

 Khanpura, who raised the matter on Wednesday, however, is yet to lodge a formal complaint. “Today, I wanted to meet the speaker but since Ramanlal Vora, the speaker, was not available, I could not lodge a complaint,” said Khanpura, adding, “I will definitely inform him on Thursday.”
 
 The Kankrej MLA said that it was not the first time that someone identifying himself as Ravi Pujari had called him up and threatened him to vacate his seat and not contest in elections.
 
 “Around 3 am, on Wednesday, I received the threat call, which was not for the first time,” said Khanpura. “I had received another call about seven days back from the caller who identified himself as Pujari and asked me not to contest.”
 
 Khanpura also said that he didn’t understand why Pujari was interested in his Kankrej seat. He wondered whether someone might be trying to scare him away from contesting polls.
 
 On Tuesday, Shankersinh Vaghela had raised the issue of Pujari’s threat calls in the assembly and had said that in the last one-and-half month, Congress’s Gujarat in-charge Gurudas Kamat and 10 MLAs including Shaktisinh Gohil, CK Raulji, Amit Chavda, Hirabhai Patel, Govabhai Rabari, Pirjada and Chandrikaben Bariya had received threat calls from the gangster.
