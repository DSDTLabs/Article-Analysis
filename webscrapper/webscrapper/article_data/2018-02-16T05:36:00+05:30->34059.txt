MUMBAI: The RBI has continued to remain mum on the more than Rs 11,000-crore fraud reported by   even as markets continued to speculate on the banks impacted by the scam. The RBI did not respond to an emailed query from TOI on whether any action has been taken. It also did not reveal if the central bank has said that PNB must honour its guarantees provided in the form of LoUs. PNB, on its part, has issued a detailed clarification to its investors stating that the RBI has been kept in the loop.

 The BSE has sought clarifications from banks that figured in news reports as being impacted by the fraud. Of these, only   has responded, stating that it has sold all its loans advanced against the guarantees issued by PNB.
 
 In a clarification issued late on Thursday, PNB said that it had submitted a fraud report to the RBI on January 29 after a first lot of LoU turned out to be fraudulent on maturity. This LoU amounted to over $44 million, equivalent to more than Rs 280 crore in respect of three group firms of Nirav Modi. In addition to Gitanjali and the   group, the bank has also filed an FIR with the   about two groups â€” Chandri Paper and Allied Products.
