MADURAI: While the stalemate between the state government and the trade unions over fixing the salary continues, almost half of the government buses stayed off the road. The rest of the buses were operated with the help of the   backed trade unions and temporary drivers as the strike entered into fourth day.

 Even as the number of buses being operated increased day by day, the percentage of the fleet utilised by TNSTC Madurai was only around 50 per cent on Sunday. Police sources said that by noon the number touched its peak of around 57 per cent. TNSTC officials said that the number would increase on Monday. 
 
 Scenario of buses operated in long routes was also improved on Sunday, with a large number of   buses operated to Chennai and other places. However, the crowd was lesser than a usual Sunday. The uncertainty over the availability of the buses was said to be the key reason.
 
 City residents had to rely on private transport facilities like mini buses and share auto rickshaws. Being a holiday, many people ventured out with their family to restaurants and theatres. “If the scenario remains the same on Monday it would affect a larger section of people. Students in particular would be affected the most,” said  , a resident of Iravathanallur.
 
 With the transportation facilities being better than Friday and Saturday, complaints of fleecing by private buses also came down. Sunday largely remained incident-free, few untoward incidents were reported on Saturday.
 
 Unidentified persons pelted stones to damage the windshield of a TNSTC bus near Silaiman on Saturday night. Based on a complaint from the driver identified as V Sakthivel, 43, from  , a case was registered with Silaiman police station. Another incident took place close the same spot, while the third incident took place near Mattuthavani.
