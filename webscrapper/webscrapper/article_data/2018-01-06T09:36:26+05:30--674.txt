JAIPUR: Rajasthan has topped the chart for having the most number of universities in the country. It stood third in number of colleges. The desert state has 78 universities (all types), followed by country’s most populous state   with 72.  , which is way ahead in academic parameters, has 58 universities. The number of colleges has jumped from 2,435 in 2010-11 to 2,774 in 2013-14, and 3,203 in 2016-17.

 But the rise in number of universities has its flip side. Except for teachers, the   doesn’t speak on other academic categories. However, other related parameters in the survey raised some pertinent questions on the unchecked rise of higher educational institutes in the state.
 
 The rise in number of institutes has severely reduced average enrolments across all categories. It has come to a level by which the state doesn’t figure in among the top five.
 
 Average enrolment per college in the state fell from 725 in 2010-11 to 665 in 2013-114. It further went down to 443 in 2016-17.
 
 This shows the dismal performance of higher education in the state. The number of colleges has sharply increased in the state but has failed to attract students.
 
 Leading the chart in average enrolments is Chandigarh with 1,964, but with number of colleges as low as 25. “The average enrolment of 443 is not sufficient for a full-fledged college to sustain. The end result is closure which is also happening at a fast rate,” said  , an expert on higher education.
 
 They also commented that the number of universities has risen without proper feasibility studies and would eventually face a meltdown. “Most of the universities are being run by corporate houses with a larger aim of branding. They are running sprawling campuses with less than 200 students,” said an expert.
 
 The survey remained silent on the institutes which have closed down in the state. Every year, an average of 20 engineering colleges shuts shop for want of students. In the 2017-18 academic session, enrolment in engineering colleges touched rock bottom—14,000 against 36,000 available seats. The strength of MBA colleges has also fallen from 150 in 2011 to less than 30 in the current academic year.
 
 
 
 Jaipur known as country’s most valued tourist destination has made a strong pitch to be known as an education hub.   has secured second position in number of higher educational institutes in the country. The city with 635 institutes is next to Bangalore, which is way ahead with 1,025 institutes. Jaipur has left behind the established education cities such as Hyderabad (487), Pune (421) and Mumbai (322). The city may be second in terms of overall institutes, but remained on the top when it came to universities. Jaipur has over 25 universities (all types). “The good law and order situation and better connectivity make Jaipur an ideal city in north, west and central India for students to pursue education. They only need to sustain the quality of education which has seen a dip in the last few years,” said  , a senior academician.
