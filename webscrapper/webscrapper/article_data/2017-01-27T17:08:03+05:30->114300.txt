 is one actor who doesn't shy away from working with newbie directors and why would he? Especially when his previous two films by debutants, Vellimoonga and Anuraga Karikkin Vellam were super hits.

  The actor will soon be seen in Orayiram Kinakkalal which will be helmed by newcomer Pramod Mohan, who had earlier directed the sitcom, Chumma- Just Fun. 
  On the movie, the director-cum-scriptwriter says, 'Like the title suggests, the film is all about a thousand dreams. The story is based on the dreams of a set of people and the short cuts they take to fulfil it. It is going to be a comedy thriller with a lot of situational humour.'
 
 Pramod says that the film's title is a tribute to popular directors Siddique and Lal, whose film Ramji Rao Speaking had featured a song with the lyrics Orayiram Kinakkalal' 'My film's genre is similar to their directorial debut Ramji Rao Speaking,' he adds.
 
  Biju Menon plays a UK returnee in the movie. 'His character Sreeram wants to settle down in Kochi with his wife and four- year-old child. Sharu P Varghese of Mudhugauv fame is the female protagonist in the film.'
 
  The movie will go on floors by the first quarter of 2017 and will be shot extensively at Kochi. 'We have an interesting set of cast and a technical team. This includes cinematographer Santosh Anima, music director Ranjith Meleppatt and art director Vinesh Banglan,' he says. The additional dialogues and screenplay will be written by Kiran Varma and Hrishikesh Mundani.
