THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Offering solace to the shelterless poor, the   as the   to set up `Shelter for the Urban Homeless' (SUH) as part of the   (NULM) project.

 As part of the project, the Kudumbashree is set to con duct a survey of the shelterless across the state from July 15.
 
 In the pilot survey, 250 individuals were identified as homeless poor on the streets across Kerala.
 
 Ahead of the survey , a meeting was held by officials with police personnel on night patrol, night duty security staff in various organizations, night autos and street vendors at night to have first-hand information on the shelterless sleeping on roadside pavements at night.
 
 The survey team will comprise members from the district Kudumbashree mission management unit, corporation, municipality, health department and the police. Each team will comprise at least three members and the survey is expected to be completed in a month, Kudumbashree officials said.
 
 “Though the urban homeless people contribute to the economy of the cities through their cheap labour in the informal sector, yet they live with no shelter or social security protection. The urban homeless survive with many challenges such as no access to elementary   like health, education, food, water and sanitation. The SUH project aims at ensuring a better livelihood for all in urban areas,“ said Kudumbashree executive director S Harikishore.
