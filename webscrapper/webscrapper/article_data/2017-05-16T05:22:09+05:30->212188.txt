GURUGRAM: Panic gripped the DLF Phase II area early morning on Monday when a major fire broke out in an independent three-bedroom house on the second floor. While the family of six, including two children, managed to escape unhurt, their properties were damaged. 

 The fire broke out around 2:00am in house number K-10/16, where retired architect   lives with his wife, son, son’s wife and two grandsons, of age two years and eight years. According to the owner, around 2:00am the house was filled with smoke and the occupants started choking.
 
 According to the family, fire tenders reached late, adding to the loss. However, the fire officer I S   claims that after receiving information two fire engines were sent to the spot where they doused the fire in about an hour.
 
 “We saw that a green cloth kept outside the balcony had caught fire. We raised the alarm and with the local security’s help we made it out of the house. Police had also reached the spot. Then we called the fire brigade, but they took around 50 minutes to reach even after repeated phone calls. At first, one tender came with a small water tank. They spent some time deciding how to reach the second floor. By then flames had engulfed our house. They doused the fire after about an hour, but nothing could be saved,” Kulbir Singh, house owner and secretary of Gurudwara committee, DLF-I, told TOI.
 
 The front-side bedroom which had valuables, including cash, jewellery worth over Rs 7 lakh, documents and electronics was completely gutted.
 
 When TOI contacted I S Kashyap, he said they received the information at 3:04am and two fire engines were sent in some time. The house owner, however, said they had repeatedly called the fire station, but nobody received their calls for a long time.
 
 “Maybe the house owner wasn’t making proper calls. As soon as we got the information, our team was sent to the location,” the fire officer repeated his claim.
