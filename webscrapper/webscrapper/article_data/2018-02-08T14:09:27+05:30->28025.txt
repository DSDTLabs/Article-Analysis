MADURAI: The   on Wednesday ordered notice to the state transport secretary on a petition seeking to constitute a commission headed by a retired judge of the court to probe how the   state transport corporation ( ) sustained losses worth Rs 20,488 crores. 

 Petitioner K K Ramesh of Madurai said in his petition that TNSTC had 1.4 lakh workers and operated 22,509 buses in the state on which 2.02 crore people travelled daily. Around 650 government buses were in judicial custody as the transport corporation had failed to pay compensation in accident cases. Besides, the corporation paid Rs 12 crore a month as toll fee on national highways. While other states collected check post tax and insurance fee from the passengers along with ticket fare, this practice was not followed in Tamil Nadu. This too attracted losses for the corporation, the petitioner told the division bench of justices M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha. 
 
 The transport corporation failed to deposit Rs 2,600 crores collected from its workers towards provident fund. This had forced transport workers to call for an indefinite strike, which was suspended on the intervention of the court, the petitioner said. The government was yet to hold an inquiry to find out the causes of the Rs 20,488-crore losses. The petitioner said that various reasons including malpractices, poor management, irregularities in purchase of spare parts and machineries and misappropriation of money by leaders of trade unions affiliated to political parties and corrupt officials had contributed to the losses. 
 
 To overcome the losses and have a good administration, it was necessary to appoint an IAS officer in all divisions of the TNSTC, stay bus fare hike announced by the government recently and conduct an inquiry led by a retired judge of the high court into the matter, the petitioner said.
