After the meeting, the government has constituted a committee which will present its recommendations if it is suitable and feasible to have a separate bench of Rajasthan high court,” said  , general secretary,  , Jaipur.
 
 But lawyers of Jaipur and Jodhpur, which have high court benches, are not happy with the decision of the government for forming a committee on demand of separate bench of high court in Udaipur.
 
 “If separate bench of high court is established in Udaipur, then Jaipur and Jodhpur will have to give up some districts. For examples, there are districts such as Kota, Baran, Bundi, Jhawalar which comes under high court bench of Jaipur district. If separate high court bench is established in Udaipur, some of these districts will go under Udaipur. It will be a loss for lawyers in Jaipur,” said Rajawat.
