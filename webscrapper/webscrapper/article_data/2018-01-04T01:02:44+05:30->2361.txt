NEW DELHI: Innovation and tweaking of norms to increase competition has helped the government save about Rs 600 crore in the contract to build the longest road tunnel in India at   in Jammu & Kashmir. The 14-km tunnel, once completed, will reduce the travel time between Srinagar and Leh by at least three hours. 

 At present, driving through the tough and deadly stretch called Zojila Pass — situated at an altitude of 11,578 feet — takes three and half hours. The all-weather tunnel will reduce the travel time on this stretch to only 15 minutes, road transport and shipping minister   said while announcing the Cabinet approval for Rs 6,089 crore for all expenses required for the project. 
 
 One of the domestic infrastructure major has bagged the project at Rs 4,900 crore while the indicative cost of the projected quoted by government was Rs 5,500 crore. “We tweaked the conditions since we were not getting bids when tenders were floated four times. The intention was to allow more Indian players to participate in the bidding and we received four bids for this project,” Gadkari said. 
 
 PM   is likely to lay the foundation stone for the project in May-June. The Cabinet also approved the Rs 5,369 crore Jal Vikas Marg Project for enhanced navigation on the Haldia-Varanasi stretch of Ganga. The project is expected to be completed by March 2023 and will provide an alternative mode of environment-friendly and cost-effective transport, the shipping minister said.
