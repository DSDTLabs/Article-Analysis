MUMBAI: By the end of this financial year, there will be a total 107   across the city’s suburban stations, thanks to corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding. At present, 41 escalators are operational on railway stations in the city—15 on   and 26 on  .

 “More escalators for suburban railway stations under CSR has become a possibility because of the initiative undertaken by railway minster Suresh Prabhu and minister of state for power Piyush Goyal,” said CR chief public relations officer Narendra Patil. 
 
 Western Coalfields Ltd, a  , has promised Rs 30 crore to fund the installing of escalators in Mumbai’s suburban section under the company’s CSR plan. “The Rs 30 crore will be utilized to instal 30 more escalators—25 on CR and five on WR stations—in 2017-18,” Patil said. “The escalators will bring a great relief to commuters, especially senior citizens.” 
 
 A few other PSUs have also offered funds to erect escalators to make commuting easier for scores of Mumbai’s residents.
 
 Among those planned, CR has sanctioned 19 escalators at seven suburban stations while Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation (MRVC) plans to instal 16 on eight stations. “With Western Coalfields sanctioning another 25 escalators on 19 stations, the total number of escalators on CR stations will touch 75,” said Patil.
 
 WR chief public relations officer Ravindar Bhakar said, “Of the 19 escalators sanctioned under CSR by public sector units, five will be financed by Western Coalfied, 12 by Power Finance Corporation and two by Powergrid.” MRVC will fund four escalators and Western Railway 24.
