BHUBANESWAR: The BJP's impressive performance in the latest round of assembly elections has fuelled hopes of the state unit about the party's prospects in 2019. 

 The winds of change that the BJP boasted of following the saffron surge in Odisha in the aftermath of the panchayat election has been bolstered further with the clean sweep in Uttar Pradesh,   and a good show in Manipur.
 
 BJP insiders are now more than confident that it won't be difficult to halt Naveen Patnaik and the BJD from returning to power in the assembly election in two years' time. 
 
 "The results of the assembly elections as well as the rural polls in Odisha are seen as positive votes, a referendum for Narendra Modi government's policies in the past three years. Moreover, anti-incumbency against the government of the day - as reflected in the results in all the five states of UP, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Goa and Manipur - is being seen as a bright spot by the saffron outfit in its fight against the Naveen government," a political analyst observed.
 
 In 2019, when the Odisha assembly will go to polls simultaneously with the   election, Naveen would have completed four successive terms, too long a time for any incumbent government to remain popular, another analyst opined.   president Basanta Panda felt people's appreciation of the Modi government's pro-poor policies and his party's rising organizational strength at the grassroots level have given it reasons to be optimistic for 2019. 
 
 "People are fed up with Naveen's approach. The change is in the air. People feel the BJP is the only alternative," Panda said. Many BJD leaders felt the party would face a formidable challenge in the next assembly polls the way the saffron outfit has been making its presence felt across the nation. 
 
 On record, however, BJD spokesperson Amar Satpathy said the party has no reasons to worry.
