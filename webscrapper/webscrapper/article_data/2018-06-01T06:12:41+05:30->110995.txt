MUMBAI: The state government has decided to increase the   of   working under  , which includes   and   in  , to 60 from 58. The decision will not affect the health services in hospitals in the cities, including JJ or St George’s.

 The proposal was sent to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for the final nod. An official said the CMO has approved the proposal, and will soon issue a government resolution. “The government could not announce the decision earlier due to the code of conduct in place for the graduate constituency elections for the legislative council,” said a state government official.
 
 Of the over 8,000 scheduled posts of doctors in rural health services, only 6,000 have been filled. Rural health services are already in very bad shape due to non-availability of specialists like paediatricians, gynaecologists and surgeons. 
 
 “Doctors are not willing to join the post in rural areas and go on long leaves instead, which affects the health services there,” said a senior official from the state health department. “To fix the situation, the government has decided to increase the retirement age of doctors so that existing doctors stay at least for the next two years and treat patients.” On Thursday, about 250 doctors were due for retirement.
