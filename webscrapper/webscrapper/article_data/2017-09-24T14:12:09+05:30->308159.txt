COLVA: Launching a membership drive for youth,   president Shantaram   said that youth were rendered jobless because of the BJP-government’s demonetization move which was the cause of recession in the country.

 Naik went on to criticize the BJP for trying to downplay the role of Congress leaders in the freedom struggle. Naik said that the BJP had started giving due respect to the father of the nation Mahatma Gandhi but was shying away from admitting that BJP leaders were supporting English rulers during the freedom struggle.
 
 “There is a difference between the Congress and BJP organizations, while there is Sevadal and mahila wings in the Congress, the BJP’s frontal organizations are RSS,   and Bajrang Dal,” said Naik at the launch of the membership drive in  .
 
 Former chief minister and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat urged youth to take a keen interest in politics but simultaneously added that youth had become wayward due to lack of political direction. 
 
 He further said if the youth are vibrant the country can march forward. 
 
 In a parting shot at his own party leadership, Kamat said the Congress leadership had underestimated the unity of various Congress panels in the Margao constituency.
