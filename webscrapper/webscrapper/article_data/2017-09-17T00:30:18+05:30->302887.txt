Panaji: Goa Police has directed heads of educational institutes to intimate the police if they suspect any person of selling narcotic substances within their premises. 

 The police said in a circular that there are some unverified reports of narcotic substances being sold near educational institutes at a few places in the state. 
 
 “If you have noticed any such drug-related activities like consumtion, peddling or if you have any such information related to   being sold by any person near your institute, the same may be passed on to the nearest police station in-charge or the toll free number 100. The caller’s identity will be protected,” the circular states.
 
 At the recent-concluded assembly session, most members of the House raised the issue of drugs being sold outside educational institutes.
