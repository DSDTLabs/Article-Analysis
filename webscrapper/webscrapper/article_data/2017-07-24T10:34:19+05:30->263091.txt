BENGALURU:   were fighting with their backs to the wall after hosts   racked up a mammoth 605/7 declared on the second day of their four-day Dr Thimmappaiah memorial all-India cricket tournament at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here on Sunday.

 When stumps were drawn, the visitors were in dire straits on 90/5 in 34 overs, trailing by 515 runs. Left-arm spinner J Suchith and medium-pacer   did the bulk of the damage by taking two wickets each.
 
 Earlier, resuming at 343/4, KSCA rode on a brilliant century from Mir Kaunian Abbas. Resuming at his overnight 45, Abbas scored 137. His innings ended when Sarupam Purkayastha had the batsman caught by Tarjinder Singh but not before the right-hand batsman forged three crucial partnerships with Pavan Deshpande (42),   (57) and   (54 not out).
 
 Abbas' fourth-wicket stand with Deshpande fetched 90 runs. He then added 89 with Binny for the fifth wicket and 88 with Gautam for the sixth-wicket to put Karnataka in a strong position.
 
 At the RSI grounds, KSCA President's XI bowlers came up short against Andhra Cricket Association. The visitors rode on centuries from KS Bharath (157 n.o.) and Hanuma Vihari (132), and their impressive 259 second-wicket partnership, to take control of the match. Replying to President's XI's 393, Andhra ended the day at 352/2 in 81 overs, needing a further 42 runs to take the innings honours. Earlier, President's added just 24 runs to their overnight score of 369/9.
 
 Meanwhile, at the Alur grounds, KSCA Colts were faced with a huge challenge after Cricket Association of Bengal posted a formidable 426 all out in 130.2 overs. Colts started well with the opening stand between D Nischal (69 not out) and Shivam Mishra (43) realising 101 runs before the latter was trapped in front by Amit Kuila. At close, Colts were 125/1 after 49 overs.
