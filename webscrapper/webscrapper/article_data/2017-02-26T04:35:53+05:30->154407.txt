Ahmedabad: The Sarkhej Roza’s finely pierced stone mesh, ringed domes, splendid motifs and ornamentation to this day causes an intricate play of light and shade when the sun’s rays seeps through its exquisitely sculpted filigree jalis. It’s enough to takes one’s breath away. Within its 72-acre sprawling complex lie stories that are yet to be deciphered. Not much has been written about the   inscriptions on the sandstones blocks used in its construction.

  
  The   is a monument buildings and a tomb of the Sufi saint Ahmed Khattu Ganj Baksh, who was revered as the patron saint of Ahmedabad and spiritual advisor of the city’s founder   I. The structures were built between 1445 AD and 1451 AD.
 
 One of the first such inscription in   script at the Roza was discovered by the former director for epigraphy with the ASI, Dr Z A Desai while he was deciphering the Persian inscriptions on the Roza. 
 
  
  A few years later, a peon at the   committee, Hanif, found four other such inscriptions within the Roza campus. There was one on the right side walls, as one entered the Roza compound. Then the other was just below a sandstone tree support near the Baradari. The other could be seen on one of the walls of the Roza as one got down into the Ahmed-Sar tank, while another is engraved on the back walls of the Roza mosque.
 
 Some of these inscriptions describe the orientation of the Ahmed-sar tank with respect to their location. “I and linguist Dr   tried to decipher the Gujarati and Devnagri engravings along with the Roza peon. We are yet to come to a conclusion. The first such inscription was discovered by Dr Z A Desai and we will be referring to his research paper on this,” says city-based historian Rizwan Kadri. He also claims a Persian inscription on Khattu’s tomb was a poem dedicated to the Sufi saint.
