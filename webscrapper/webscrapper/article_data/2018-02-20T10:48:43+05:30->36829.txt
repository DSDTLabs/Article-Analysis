MADURAI: Till last year, the Southern Bank Road on Vaigai river used to provide a breezy passage for road users when the parallel Kamarajar Salai remains choked with traffic almost the whole day. Most two-wheeler and four wheeler users would take a diversion to reach till AV Bridge and get into regular traffic at   while small vehicles navigate till Raja Mill Road to reach Arapalyam Junction.

 But, the stretch between Kuruvikaransalai and AV Bridge, which was dug up for underground drainage (UGD) work last year, remains battered though the civic body has completed it. The road has not been laid again, causing hardship to road users. 
 
 Till 1996, these roads on the river bank were encroached by slum-dwellers. During the DMK regime from 1996 to 2001, then assembly speaker,   took efforts to clear these banks, and converted them into wide roads. During festival times as well as emergencies like road blockage, the river bank roads prove their usage, absorbing significant amount of traffic. 
 
 Between these banks, Southern Bank Road houses several small scale industries, rice mills and furniture making units especially in Ismailpuram area. Trucks, including big ones attempt to navigate the stretch and get caught in potholes. “It used to be an easy thoroughfare during traffic hours in Kamarajar Salai. Of late, at least one truck get struck here, blocking the road. So, I am forced to take Kamarajar Salai and cope with the traffic jam,” rued S  , a resident of Kamajar Salai. 
 
 Though corporation has completed UGD works, manholes overflow now and then, so corporation keeps working on them. “When the road was laid, lot of vehicles used this stretch. Now it is a backbreaking task to ride in this stretch,” recalled P Ponnusamy, a resident of Ismailpuram.
