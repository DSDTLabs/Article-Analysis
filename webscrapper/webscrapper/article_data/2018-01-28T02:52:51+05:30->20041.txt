NOIDA: Teachers and principals of government schools in the district have urged that   (PTM) be formalised as a routine affair every month. This demand came after the first formally convened parent-teachers meeting (PTM) was held in 685 government schools of the district and saw the participation of nearly 70% parents.

 Most parents and teachers were excited about the PTM. Nearly 78,000 children study in government schools in GB Nagar district.
 
 While some schools said they already hold PTMs on their premises every month, not many parents would turn up.
 
 Kiran Bala, principal of the primary school in Harola, told TOI, “We had been organising PTMs earlier too but they drew very poor response. Now, with the direction from the district administration and the day being reserved for the PTM, many parents participated and shared their problems. We were able to discuss the problems of irregular children with them.”
 
 Priya Saini, a student of Class V at Adarsh primary school in Sector 12, is a bright student but is irregular, her teacher complained. “She always completes her homework and performs well in tests but is very irregular. You should send her to school every day,” the teacher told her mother Sushma Saini.
 
 “We stay in Khoda and do not send her in the absence of her brother, since children go missing sometimes. She has to take a UP Roadways bus on her own as there is no school bus available from there. My son is not very regular and this results in her absence too,” Sushma told TOI.
