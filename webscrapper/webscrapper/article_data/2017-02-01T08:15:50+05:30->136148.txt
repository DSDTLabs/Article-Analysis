KOLHAPUR: Rohit Tambekar, a youngster from Gargoti village who recently completed the Pune-Kanyakumari cycle tour to encourage people to use cycles, has taken his initiative one step further by printing the   on his  .

 Rohit, a graphic designer, started using cycle to travel to his workplace a few years ago and after he realised its benefits, he urged his friends to do it too. Recently, he led a tour from Pune to Kanyakumari to promote   to work place and incorporating it into everyday life. So far, more than 25 people have been inspired by Rohit and have started using cycle to work.
 
 When asked about his decision to print the benefits of cycling on his invitation cards, Rohit said, “We have printed more than 1,500 cards containing this message. Many people asked me about this concept and promised that they would give the message some serious thought. It was a good medium to start a conversation in comparison to the usual methods.” 
 
 “During our cycle tour to Kanyakumari, we interacted with people from colleges, government offices and corporate offices in Karnataka, Kerala, and Chennai,” he said.
 
 “Cycling is the need of the hour. Pollution levels are on the rise. Cities like Delhi and Beijing are being chocked by pollution. It is our responsibility to use cycle to for better air and health. Cycling is a good option for people who have desk jobs, like those work in corporate and government offices and software companies. It could reduce traffic on road and pave the way for a better future. I have completed many cycle tours like Kolhapur-Pune, Kolhapur-Goa, Pune-Kanyakumari.”
 
 Rohit‘s friend, Kirtiraj Desai who works in a government polytechnic in the city said, “Rohit urged us to use cycle. As I work in the government polytechnic, I hardly need to go outside. So, cycle is a preferable mode of transportation. I daily travel 8km on my cycle to reach the workplace. This helped me complete the Pune-Kanyakumari cycle tour in January.”
