The last RAW before WWE’s first pay-per-view of the year, The  , was going to be an exciting one with both   and   scheduled to be at the Quicken Loans Arena, Cleveland, Ohio for the show. The much anticipated standoff between Goldberg and the Lensar did happen in the final segment of the show, but no one expected that the standoff could be interrupted. 

 The Undertaker’s gong hit, the lights went out and there stood the ‘Phenom’ staring down the visibly shocked Lesnar and Goldberg. With all three superstars entering the rumble, many would have been anticipating this epic standoff at the Rumble match but RAW got it absolutely right with this booking and it sets up not only a fantastic Rumble moment but a possible angle between the three going in to Wrestlemania.

 Also, the show witnessed a championship match, for the United States strap which the challenger Roman Reigns won, although via disqualification, meaning the strap remains with champion Chris Jericho despite the loss. Sami Zayn earned himself a spot in the Royal Rumble match defeating Seth Rollins via the small package when Rollins was distracted by the Triple H’s entrance music. The Game, however, never showed up but did enough to cost Rollins the match
