Pune: Nearly two months after the civic education board was dissolved, the Pune Municipal Corporation ( ) is yet to form an alternative body, which will regulate more than 330 schools and 70,000 students.

 The civic administration issued the dissolution order in June when the term of the board came to an end. 
 
 A temporary team for the education department is being readied by the PMC. 
 
 The department will be headed by the additional municipal commissioner (general). The education officer will be the branch head of the secondary division and the administrative officer (education) will look after the primary division. 
 
 The staff working for the school board will be shifted to other departments according to their rank.
 
 “The law and state government orders have made it mandatory to form a separate body to look into the affairs of civic schools. But no action has yet been initiated in this regard. As a result, students are suffering,” Dilip Barate, a municipal corporator, said. Students are facing problems of non-availability of educational material and delay in receiving scholarships.
 
 The civic body’s central stores depot will be responsible for the purchase of stationery and other material for the department. The bank accounts of the school board will be closed. The PMC’s audit section will take charge of financial transactions of the education department.
 
 Of the total budget of Rs 400 crore, the civic body spends over Rs 50 crore every year as financial aid. 
 
 “Currently the standing committee and the civic administration is taking decisions regarding educational activities,” Murlidhar Mohol, chairman of the standing committee, said.
 
 Civic schools impart education in various mediums including Marathi, English, Urdu and Kannada. Around one lakh students are enrolled in these schools. Most of them belong to the underprivileged section of the society.
