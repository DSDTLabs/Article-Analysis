Coimbatore: Two men died and another man is struggling for his life after the goods autorickshaw they were travelling in was buried under a heap of M-sand dislodged from a truck on the Sulur-Coimbatore Road on Monday. The deceased were identified as T Vellaian, 26, of Arasanur in Trichy and A Karthick, 21, of Thirunarayanapuram, also in Trichy. “Vellaian was the driver of the goods autorickshaw and Karthick was travelling with him. S Kumar, 18, of Sivagiri in Tirunelveli district, who was also in the three-wheeler, suffered injuries on his scalp and is undergoing treatment in a private hospital at Sulur,” a police officer said. The trio was travelling towards Sulur from Coimbatore in the autorickshaw when the incident happened. “When they reached near the Sri Krishna Maruti Showroom on the Sulur-Coimbatore Road, a speeding tipper truck carrying M-sand heading towards Coimbatore overturned, dislodging the sand on the vehicle. Though an earthmover was used to remove the sand, Vellaian and Karthick had died of suffocation. Kumar, who was struggling for life, was sent to a private hospital,” the officer added. The bodies were handed over to the families of the victims after postmortem at the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH).  Traffic was affected on the Trichy Road for more than one-and-a-half hours following the incident.
