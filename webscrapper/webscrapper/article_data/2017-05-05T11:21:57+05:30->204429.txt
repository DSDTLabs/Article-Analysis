THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: How many advisers chief minister of the state have?

 It seems chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan himself is clueless about the exact number.
 
 In a reply given to two different questions raised by the opposition members in the House, he gave two different figures. To the question raised by T V Ibrahim and Parakkal Abdulla on April 25, the chef minister said that he has six advisers.But on the same day , to a different question raised by M Vincent, the chief minister said he has eight advisers.
 
 The written replies to these two questions were placed before the House on Thursday which later created a row. V D   raised this issue before the House and said that the chief minister was misleading the House. Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan later intervened in the issue and said that he would look into the disparities in the answers.
 
 The chief minister has six advisers at present.John   (media), M C   (science), N K Jayakumar (law), C S Renjith (development),   (finance) and Ra man   (law and order).
 
 The other day , opposition leader Ramesh Chennit hala had complai ned to the speaker that the chief mini ster was not giving replies to the written questions asked by the members of the House on the home department and on his office. He had said that till date, 113 questions have gone unanswered and wanted the Speaker to take effective steps to get the answers. Following this the chief minister's office placed all the answers before the House on Thursday .
