MUMBAI: After alleged illegal alterations by Shiv Sena man   brought down the   building in Ghatkopar, the BMC has cracked a whip on 300-odd unauthorized constructions which are standing on encroached public space.

 On Saturday, the BMC instructed its 24 ward officers to take immediate action against illegal structures, especially commercial ones.
 
 “There are several structures which are on encroached public spaces. A list of such structures has been drawn up, especially in cases where notices have been served and court orders have ruled in favour of BMC,” said a civic official, requesting anonymity. Civic officials have been told to apply for police protection in advance so that demolition can begin from Monday.
 
 A ward official, however, said that the crackdown has nothing to do with Tuesday’s Ghatkopar building collapse. “These are routine demolition drives that the BMC carries out as there is a backlog. Despite occupants being served with notices, they do not vacate the space. Action is pending in many cases,” said the officer.
 
 Activists called this a knee-jerk reaction, which happens every time there is a tragedy in the city. King’s Circle activist   said, “Following the fire at   in Kurla in 2015, which killed eight persons, the BMC cracked down on several restaurants flouting safety norms. Later, it told the hotels to themselves put up boards stating that their premises are fire safe. This action against commercial structures is similar.”
