AYODHYA/FAIZABAD:   leader and Ram temple movement protagonist   on Wednesday raised the issue of building a temple at the disputed site in Ayodhya. 

 Talking to TOI on the phone from Delhi, Katiyar said the "Ram Mandir" issue would always be alive and no compromise would be made on it. "Ram Mandir must be built on the site where the Babri Masjid once stood," he said.
 
 "The Ram Mandir movement started by Vinay Katiyar 30 years ago became the base for the giant leap of the BJP," he said.
 
 Coming after the   ruling that seeking votes in the name of religion would be considered a corrupt electoral practice, Katiyar's statement is likely to create a storm.
 
 Katiyar, however, said his statement should not be connected to the   elections. 
 
 "There is no need to connect Ram Mandir with state elections, but Ram Mandir is an old issue and this issue must be raised till the construction of a great temple at Lord Ram's birth place in Ayodhya," he said.
 
 He said the temple issue was inherent to the BJP and the party could not abandon it.
 
 The founder of right-wing organisation  , Katiyar had played an important role in the temple movement from 1986 till the demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992.
 
 Katiyar's statement came a day after BJP state president Keshav Maurya had said a grand temple would be built in Ayodhya if the BJP secured a majority in Uttar Pradesh.
