KOLKATA:   (KoPT) will start operating the first heritage cruise on the Hooghly from April 28, it was decided on Wednesday. 

 The cruise will start from KoPT's   at the Old Fairlie Warehouse. This museum is a treasure trove for those interested in the country's maritime history. According to KoPT secretary S Pradhan, the museum also has the only facility after the National Library to preserve old documents that go back in time to when Kolkata was a bustling city under the British. From the heritage centre, tourists will be transported to the historic Man of War Jetty in Prinsep Ghat. From there, they will board a cruise vessel for the next two-and-a-half-odd hours to take a look at historical structures.
 
 "The cruise will pass along historic ghats, the   jetties where foreign ships used to berth, the Howrah bridge, the Kidderpore Dock lockgates, the oldest marine workshop,   where Nawab Wajed Ali Shah was kept by the British and the Netaji Subhas Dock Lockgate. If timings match, the tourists can also watch ships moving into the port through the lockgates. They will also get to see the Suriname Memorial. The tour will end at the Indenture Memorial and Old Clock Tower site," said Gautam Chakraborti, security advisor and heritage co-ordinator, KoPT.
 
 "There is so much to see and learn. The Kolkata port is steeped in heritage. Places like the Indenture Memorial are staging points for most of the Indian diaspora. I am not aware of any other port in the country that has so much heritage to showcase," KoPT chairman Vinit Kumar said.
