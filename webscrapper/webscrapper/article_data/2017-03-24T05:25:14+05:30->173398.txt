PATNA: Apparently taking a cue from UP chief minister  , Bihar animal husbandry minister   on Thursday said a report has been sought from the DMs on illegal   operating in their respective districts despite a ban on cattle slaughter in the state.
 
  The  , 1955 allows slaughtering of only the bovines that are either more than 15 years old or disabled. Also, such animals can be slaughtered only after antimortem so as to prevent spread of any disease.
  
  “There is a committee in every district headed by the DM to monitor cattle slaughter. We have asked the DMs to submit a report on illegal slaughterhouses so that steps can be taken to stop such illegal activities,” the minister told reporters outside the state legislative assembly.
  
  Closure of illegal slaughterhouses was one the poll promises of Yogi. Reports said a number of unlicensed slaughterhouses have been shut in UP ever since Yogi took over as the CM on Sunday.
  
  Bihar animal husbandry officials admitted most slaughter houses in the state are illegal. “As per the last assessment done by the department, there are 144 slaughter houses running in the state and only one or two are registered with the urban local body concerned. While the number of such slaughterhouses is higher in the Seemanchal region, including Kishanganj and Purnia, over a dozen slaughterhouses run illegally in   and Patna City areas of the state capital,” said an official, preferring anonymity.
