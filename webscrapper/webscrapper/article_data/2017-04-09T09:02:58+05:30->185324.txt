LUCKNOW: The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to digitise all important books found from the trunks once owned by   alias Bhagwanji, who many believe was   living in disguise. For others, Gumnami Baba was a seer who lived in solitude in Faizabad and Ayodhya for nearly a decade till death on September 16,1985. State culture department has been entrusted the task of digitising the books for which Rs 1.12 lakh has been allocated.

 The former government led-by Akhilesh Yadav, in accordance with the 2013 Allahabad high court order directed officials to keep belongings of Gumnami Baba on display in Ram Katha Museum and Art Gallery in Ayodhya. Historian Hugh Purcell in a journal ‘History Today’ wrote that the collection of books was “most thought-provoking”. 
 
 Purcell wrote, “Bose had received an English medium education (finishing at  ) and, in the eyes of the British, had committed war crimes against them possibly escaping to the Soviet Union. On the other hand, he appreciated, Gulliver’s Travels, P G Wodehouse's ‘The Inimitable Jeeves’, the scarcely available International Military Tribunal for the Far East, The History of the Freedom Movement in India, The Last Days of the Raj, Moscow’s Shadow Over West Bengal and Solzhenitsyn's The Gulag Archipelago. This could not be the bedtime reading of a typical sadhu. Either he had been an obsessive collector of Bose memorabilia, or someone had added to his possessions posthumously as a hoax, or he really was Bose.”
