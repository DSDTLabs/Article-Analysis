KOLKATA: A day after the alleged rape of a three-year-old girl inside a bus at   in Ultadanga by its conductor, Lalbazar claimed it would implement a parking policy for the 5500-odd buses in the city. The new policy, claimed an officer, will allow cops to confiscate a bus parked for more than 10 weeks at one spot.

 
  said they would also make each bus owner responsible for any crime committed inside his vehicle. “The bus owner should inform each traffic guard where he is parking his bus. It’s his duty to ensure that no one can have access to the bus which can then be used to commit crime. In addition, all abandoned buses — single buses not parked in clusters and those which have not been driven in a while — will either be taken to the police guard or the dumping yard,” said DC (traffic) Sumit Kumar.
 
 
 The police said they have been receiving multiple complaints of   being used to plan and commit crimes. “This is particularly true in added areas and some pockets of east Kolkata like the Canal Road from where this incident was reported,” said an officer. Police said special drives, in consultation with the KMC, will be undertaken.
 
 
 Police sources admitted that most buses do not have a permanent garage or a permanent terminus, forcing drivers to park their vehicles on main roads and wider by-lanes. “We are asking the owners to make sure that such buses remain locked. The helpers and drivers cannot be allowed to sleep there. It may, however, take some time to discipline them,” said an officer from Lalbazar’s traffic planning wing.
 
 
 Earlier in January, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation had raised questions about unused old cars and damaged vehicles parked on important roads. Meanwhile cops produced accused Sk Munna in the special   and asked for his police custody. The cops have slapped sections 4 and 6 of the   against him.
