Chandigarh: No re-employed faculty of the Panjab University will continue to hold office in his respective department after his tenure is over as per the appointment period. As per the new guidelines that will be presented in the upcoming syndicate scheduled on September 23 for approval, a re-employed faculty will have to vacate his office space within one month after the tenure of his office of re-employment is over.

 After receiving number of complaints from various departments stating that they have been unable to get the office space vacated from the re-employed faculty even after the completion of their tenure, the Panjab University vice-chancellor Professor Arun Kumar Grover constituted a committee to set guidelines for the issue which would be followed by all departments and centre of the campus. The complainants further said they are unable to provide office space to the regular staff as the rooms have been occupied by the re-employed staff even after their completion of the tenure, who neither come to the department for any work nor handover the office space to the department.
 
 There are more than 100 re-employed faculties who are presently working in various departments of the campus. As per the norms which the university is following a faculty member can work in university till the age of 60 years and after that can be re-employed for five years in their respective department. In university every department used to have an administrative committee that handled such issues but owing to the lack of the guidelines, the committee fail to take any action on the faculty.
 
 The committee recommended giving a one-month notice to the re-employed faculty to vacate the room but there are suggestions to review the cases before the serving notice. There are cases where members of the re-employed faculty are handling prominent projects of the university and thus should not be served any notice under the said guidelines.
