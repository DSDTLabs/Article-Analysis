MUMBAI: On a lazy Sunday afternoon, as the sun slowly moved down towards the horizon, tabla maestro   played to inaugurate the   and the Vijay Tendulkar Rangmanch at Juhu.

 The inauguration with a musical performance by Husa in, accompanied by Shabir Khan on the Sarangi, marked a decade-long relentless effort by local citizen groups, Gulmohar Citizen's Welfare Group and Save Open Spaces, to reclaim the open space along the Irla nullah.
 
 The baug and rangmanch now form a contiguous open space along with Kaifi Azmi Park. The brainchild of activist PK Das to create open spaces along the city's nullah is part of his   plan.
 
 Rajya Sabha member  , who funded the development of the open space through his MP Local Area Development Fund, said it was necessary to reclaim the city for its citizens. Akhtar who composed a poem `Hill Station', for the occasion, said it was ironic that people have to go to other places in search of greenery and serenity .
 
 It was 10 years ago that citi zens first came out, demanding that they be allowed access to the open space. Ashoke Pandit, who led the agitations to reclaim the open space, said, “Back then, this was a wooded place and it had become a den for drug addicts. Then there was a plan to build a private club by the   to whom the land had been leased. Around 500 trees were cut.“
 
 They were joined in their fight by actor and former parliamentarian,  .
 
 The work on creating the walk of fame along either side of the nullahwill be completed in a few months. The path will have statues of famous personalities from Juhu.
