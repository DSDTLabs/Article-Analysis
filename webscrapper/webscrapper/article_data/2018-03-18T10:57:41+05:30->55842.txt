It’s the one day in the year when, for gourmets in Delhi, breakfast is not the most important meal of the day – dinner is! The Times Food and Nightlife Awards 2018, or the ‘Food Oscars’, were held in a glitzy ceremony at the ITC Maurya on March 15, and had in attendance actors, beauty queens, TV stars, fashion designers, top cops and bureaucrats.

  
  
 
  Filmfare Award-winning actor, singer, songwriter and foodie   unveiled the brand new Times Food and Nightlife Guide 2018 for Delhi and the rest of the NCR. The guide, in a swanky new avatar that features the best of the best in each category, has been compiled by food critic Marryam H Reshii and nightlife expert Deepali Gupta. The stylish black book gives you the lowdown on not only the best places to eat at and party at, but also tells you about culinary trends, the Delhi foodscape, food from across the country and more. 
 
  Emcee Anuj Gurwara had guests laughing as he cracked jokes and set the mood for the evening. Once they had worked up an appetite, after the awards ceremony, the guests made a beeline for the famous dinner spread. Even fitness-conscious Ayushmann, shooting in Delhi for Junglee Pictures’ Badhaai Ho, stopped by the bowl of nihari!
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
  The Times Food and Nightlife Awards 2018 honoured the best in the F&B industry across categories and cities – from premium to casual dining, and from not just Delhi, but also Gurgaon and Noida. Said Zubin Songadwala, general manager, ITC Maurya, New Delhi, “We are proud that Bukhara and Dum Pukht continue to retain their legendary status at the  , the nation’s Food Oscars. This recognition endorses ITC Hotels’ endeavours to present the finest renditions of India’s culinary traditions and encourages us to strive to preserve and present the rich legacy of our nation.”
 
  Ayushmann Khurrana, who unveiled the new-look guide this year and gave away awards to the winners, stayed on to sample the nihari and Mughlai food. Actor, singer and popular host Maniesh Paul also spoke about his love for food, saying, “It was lovely being here, and being a Delhiite and a Punjabi, I can never resist food!” Popular TV actor Karan Vohra, who was there with his wife, said he hadn’t had a cheat day like this in ages – he had something from nearly every stall, he said! TV actor Vishal Malhotra, who also presented awards to the winners, said, “This is my first time experiencing a festival of food like this. I have to shoot after this, but I think idhar se jaane ke baad suit hi nahi fit aayega!”
 
  The Times Food and Nightlife Awards, Delhi-NCR, 2018 were presented in association with Swiggy, India’s largest food ordering and delivery platform, Narang Group - O Smart Natural Mixers, drink smart mix Natural and QUA natural mineral water, and Diageo – Johnnie Walker The Journey that has told stories of personal progress.
