GURUGRAM: Green activists were up in arms, after land mafia broke a fence put up by the forest department during the past week to encroach upon land in Mangar, which has the only “sacred grove” in Delhi-NCR.

 Reportedly, land mafia pulled down 10 to 12 poles of a 400m-long fence along the Gurugram-Faridabad road.
 
 
  
 Afterwards, not only have they installed a portacabin in the area, but also levelled an area of around 4,000 sq yd with mud, destroying the topography of the land.
 
 Located close to Mangar police post, it’s the same piece of land where over 500 trees were felled in December 2017. “After trees were felled and we filed complaints, the forest department fined the offenders. But over the past week, such attempts have once again begun in the same area,” said   of environmental NGO Save Aravalis.
  
 Bhadana alleged that forest officials are hands in gloves with the land mafia. 
 
 “Despite all these complaints, I have not got a single response from the forest department. Police said forest department is misleading them by saying it has granted permission to encroach upon the area. However, such permit in areas under sections 4&5 can’t be given,” he alleged.
 
  A cop at Mangar police post, on condition of anonymity, said, “We’ve received a complaint and informed the forest department about it. But, a few days ago we were told by a forest official that permission for construction on this land has been granted, though we’re yet to receive anything from them in writing.”
 
 This is the eighth reported case of   in the Aravali, and the third in Mangar, since December. The encroached area lies within 1km-radius of Asola Bhatti Sanctuary.
 
 Neither conservator of forest (Gurugram circle) D Hembram, nor district forest officer (Faridabad) Ranbir Singh, were available for comments.
