Nagpur: The anti-narcotics cell of crime branch seized 1.24kg charas, worth around Rs1.24 lakh, from a peddler at New Narsala Road on Tuesday. The peddler, identified as Nilesh Asre, had come to the place in his car, which too has been seized. 

 The anti-narcotics cell, under PI RD Nikam and API Dilip Chandan, had received information regarding a peddler selling charas. The police unit sent a decoy customer to lay a trap for Asre. The informer, posing as a customer, lured Asre to purchase charas from him. As per the deal, Asre was supposed to come near Gajanan Temple on New Narsala Road, where the police informer had promised to wait with the cash. 
 
 When Asre reached the place, the police team nabbed him red-handed with the contraband consignment. He was taken to Hudkeshwar police station where an offence was registered against him under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. PI Nikam said that Asre’s background would be thoroughly probed once his remand custody is procured from court. “We intend to find out the source of the consignment, and since when he has been engaged in peddling narcotics,” said Nikam.
