 Donal Bisht, who plays the protagonist on the show, is rumoured to be in a relationship with her director  , and the crew members swear by their chemistry. Seems, the two even took off to Goa recently, to spend quality time with each other.
 
 Informs a unit hand, “Everyone on the set is aware of Donal and Prateek’s relationship. They have been dating since five months and their families, too, know about it. The show’s producer,  , played Cupid between them. They hang out together post the shoot and whenever they get a day off. While their equation is evident to everyone, they are mum about it.”
 
 When contacted, Donal denied any truth to the buzz and said, I am not in a relationship. Why will I hide it if I am dating someone? I would rather announce it. I went to Goa with four friends, not just prateek. Also, what’s the problem if I go out with him or any other friend? Can’t I do that?”
 
 Prateek echoed the sentiment, “We were a group of four-five friends, who went to Goa. I have always been open about my relationships, but there is nothing between Donal and me. Whenever there is anything, I will talk about it.”
