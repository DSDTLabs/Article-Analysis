With two leading ladies on his couch,   Khan and  ,   knew that he wouldn't have to do much to keep the coffee talk going. The two actresses are known to be uninhibited and outspoken, and that is exactly what they were on Karan's show. 
 
  In the episode that aired this Sunday (January 14), it was hilarious to see Karan accusing   of being a pregnant stalker since she is always in the know of things. Right from tracking her industry friends' airport looks to the rumours and gossip that surrounds them, there is nothing that Kareena is not aware of.
  
  Karan also went on to call her a Jagga Jasoos. He talked about how Kareena ridicules his fashion sense by sending him his airport looks with a question mark. Goes without saying, there are many others who come under the fire for their fashion blunders by the actress.
  
  
 
  
  And this was not all. Kareena backfired by including Karan and Ranbir in the gang of gossip-mongers as well. This observation was further validated by Arjun Kapoor, who appeared as a jury on the show. Arjun went on to say that Kareena is running the film industry as she, Karan and Ranbir know everything beforehand.
  
  After the madness of this one, the next episode of   will see Quantico star Priyanka Chopra. 
  airs every Sunday at 9 pm on Star World and Star World HD.
