AHMEDABAD: The investigating agencies are generally flooded with cases where murders are dressed up as accidental deaths. However, in a case reversal, experts from central forensic science laboratory (CFSL),   at New Delhi concluded that a case of suspected murder was in fact an accidental death.

 A paper presented by Nilesh   and   discussed a case of December 2015 handled by them. Body of a 45-year-old man, belonging to lower socio-economic strata, was found from a public park in South Delhi area. The man had injury mark on back of his head and blood was oozing out of his nose and ears.
 
 As the relatives alleged it to be a case of murder by friends, the case was referred to the forensic experts. Wagh said that the specific method of psychological autopsy, also known as equivocal death analysis, was employed due to circumstances of the case.
 
 “A popular method of deduction in countries like the US, it’s a new concept in India. It includes analysis of the crime scene, interviews with family members, relatives, friends and all other associated with the person. It also entails examination of medical, psychological, educational records and takes into consideration police report and laboratory results,” said Wagh.
 
 In the case, the investigators got to know that on the night of the incident the victim was hanging out with his friends and he was in highly inebriated condition. The friends’ statements were checked with polygraph examination which termed them innocent.
 
 “In the end, it was deduced that he had fallen at the spot and had sustained injuries. However, as he was heavily drunk, he could not get up and seek help. The internal injuries – proved fatal. The conclusion was drawn on the basis of the factors such as – he was new to the place and did not know the spot where he fell, there was no disturbed crime scene, no sign of struggle and absence of defensive behaviour,” said Wagh.
