Renowned Indian lyricist  , who has extensively written about different elements of nature, says it has been always been part of his "poetic imagination". 

 The poet, who will be inaugurating an art show titled "Shakhein: Another Tree, Another Sky" by Delhi-based artist Renuka, says the show has a special appeal for him.
 
 "The world of nature and the environment has always been a part of my poetic imagination. Renuka's paintings on trees and skies, clouds and seasons have a special appeal for me. 
 
 "The passion and freshness with which she explores the wonders of nature, and highlights the dangers that threaten our environment, have touched a chord in me," Gulzar told PTI. 
 
 Inspired by nature, the exhibition features paintings that highlight environmental degradation. 
 
 The show, featuring a set of 30 paintings in oils and acrylics, depicts a refreshing perspective on nature and and especially trees. 
 
 "I often go to Mussoorie even now and I am usually pained to see how the landscape has changed. These forests have almost disappeared as the hills have been vandalised. I still live in those forests, and relive those monsoon sunsets, the green hills turning pink, purple and gold," she says. 
 
 The artist has used bottle and nozzle as her instrument to create swaying movement of the trees, while brush and knife have been used to create the textural effect on the canvas. 
 
 "It's never too late and one is never too old to talk about what one feels strongly about. Through my work, I want to not only revisit my childhood but also bring back focus on why environment protection is important," she says. 
 
 The exhibition will begin from March 1 at the Visual Arts Gallery here.
