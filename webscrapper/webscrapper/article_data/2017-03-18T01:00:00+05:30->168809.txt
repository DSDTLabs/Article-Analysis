 invited Punjabi singers   and   to conclude the last day of the college's annual cultural festival, Quintessence. Students danced to Punjabi beats as the duo performed at the college's sports ground.

 
 While Babbal began the performance, Jassi joined him later on stage. Starting with the original version of the song 'Challa', from the movie 'Crook', he said, "Aap sab bhangra ke liye taiyyar ho? Because   is all about bhangra."
 
  As he started singing the song, he added, "Main apna college karke Australia chala gaya tha. Socha tha wahan jaake paise kamaunga, par bahut struggle bhi kiya. Wahan taxi bhi chalayi aur tab yeh gaana likha tha. You all are in college now, so we all wish that you do best in your studies."

 Though Jassi came on the stage an hour later, he told everyone, "Main toh kabse ready baitha tha, par stage se hari jhandi nahin mil rahi thi. But thank you so much for your love, it means a lot to us."
 
  The students, however, danced throughout the performance on dhol beats. Anjali Bisht, a first year student of BA (Programme), told us, "I havenâ€™t listened to their songs before. But I have been dancing on all the songs because of the dhol beats."
 
  Bulbul, another student of BA (Programme) added, "Punjabi songs ka yehi hota hai. Chahe samajh na aaye, but dance toh kar hi lete hain."
