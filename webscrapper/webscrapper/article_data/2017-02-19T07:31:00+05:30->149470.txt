SHIMLA: Distressed prisoners of   are now getting a cathartic treatment to bring positivity and hope towards life, as they are now painting art on walls of the jail after learning techniques from professionals. 

 Taking out time through their tight schedules, a couple from the state and eminent artists and painters,   and Renu Kashyap, have volunteered to teach basic painting techniques including drawing and filling colours to the prison inmates of Kaithu jail of Shimla.
 
 Himachal Pradesh director general (DG) of prisons   has initiated the idea. “Painting is one of the art forms which can bring cheers among prisoners who feel trapped and helpless. It helps the brush holders in creating a positive outlook diminishing stress and refines thoughts of individuals from negative to positive as the person undergoes catharsis while doing any art form. Paintings will also add colour to the dark walls of jails,” he told TOI.
 
 Goel said that to let the idea gear up, he had requested the   couple to contribute their precious time in the cause. The plan took off on February 13. 
 
 “After the prisoners learnt some of the painting techniques, we conducted the first painting activity in Kaithu jail on February 16 in which half a dozen prisoners participated. From 2,200 prisoners in all 14 jails of the state, whoever wants to learn painting would be given the opportunity. But, it will not be possible for the Kashyaps to provide their time in all jails. So, I am appealing from local artists to volunteer in the cause,” he added.
 
 He said the jail inmates are provided wages for each productive task and are involved in weaving, running bakery and canteens to keep them busy. Now, the prisoners are getting paid for painting and can send their earnings to their families. “This is just the beginning. We would launch many such activities for the betterment of all,” Goel added.
