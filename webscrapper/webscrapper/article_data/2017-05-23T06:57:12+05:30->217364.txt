KOLKATA: The   have hinted they might be recording some more statements of actor  's closest acquaintances once they receive a few preliminary test reports, one of them being the blood report of the actor that was collected hours after the accident that killed model  . 

 According to sources, this might include Vikram's father Bijoy Chatterjee, who had claimed before the media that his son might have held the glass but was not drunk. He had also suggested his son had little fault in the accident, with a second "yet to be identified car" getting in the way of his son's   Altis.
 
 The police said talking to Bijoy was necessary to ascertain who had briefed him about the accident. Vikram's lawyer Rajdeep Majumdar said the family will have no problem helping the cops establish the truth. "We have been always cooperating with the police," said Majumdar. The SIT formed for this case said they might be comparing the statements with those gathered from doctors at Ruby hospital. "Sonika's family has written to the police commissioner asking for a fair probe. We will ensure all the angles are covered," said a source.
 
 Police sources insist this will not only help them establish whether Vikram had been drinking, but will also help them know whether he had tried misleading the investigators initially.
 
 Sources said while taking stock of the actor's activities during the night, cops found some anomalies in his statements and those given by Sonika's friends. "We are still finding it difficult to completely trust him in the light of some observations made by those present at the pub," said a police official.
