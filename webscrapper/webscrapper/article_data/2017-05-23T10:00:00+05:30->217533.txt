One-year-old Joey Marie Choi has no idea that she’s an online celebrity. And the credit goes to her photographer mom  !

 While Joey is napping, she dresses her up in super-adorable costumes, and click photographs that are bound to make anyone go awww…! From being a diver, baker, milkmaid, mermaid, santa, princess, rockstar, spa-goer to cartoon characters like Pikachu, Ariel, Goku, Jasmine, and even Jon Snow from Game of Thrones…this baby has donned every costume you can imagine. 
 
 Still wondering for more? Imagine Joey posing (or rather napping) as an Indian girl in sari, and it will probably make your heart melt! She’s cute, chubby, and her Insta handle is quite addictive.
 
 This little toddler has over five and a half lakh followers on Instagram, and is taking the internet by storm for all the obvious reasons! Here are some of our favourites
