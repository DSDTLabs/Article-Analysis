Patiala: Bhadson police, Patiala have booked an man and his accomplices for abducting a 17-year-old girl, who was missing since August last year. The girl’s family claimed to have tried lodging a missing complaint since then, but the cops did not register any case. 

 However, in the mid of December, last year, the family came to know about the whereabouts of their daughter, who was abducted by her cousin on the pretext of a marriage. Following this police inquired into the matter and booked the cousin and three of his accomplices on charges of abducting her. The accused were also booked under sections of POCSO Act on Tuesday.
 
 Speaking to TOI, mother of girl said, “We work as weavers and my daughter is Class X pass. For months, we did not know about our daughter and kept running from pillar to post in her search. Police refused to register any missing. It was only after we came to know in December the whereabouts of our daughter. My sister’s son, who is a labourer, had abducted her on the pretext of marriage. Now, the police have booked them and inquiring about him from his relatives.”
 
 The police, however, claimed that all the accused have been booked after they had received the complaint of abduction. The police added that girl’s family did not name anyone for abduction too. They added that investigation is going on and the girl will be recovered and accused will be nabbed, soon.
