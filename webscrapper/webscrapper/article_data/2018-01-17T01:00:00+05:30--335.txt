Every dark cloud has a silver lining, or so they say. Dr  , the director of the Sunny Deol-starrer 'Mohalla Assi' will agree. The filmmaker spent four years battling the   (CBFC) at its various offices, and the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) in the court, to get   cleared without undue cuts and with an ‘A’ certificate. However, we hear the story doesn’t end there. The filmmaker has not just won the court battle, but has also convinced Sunny to work with him again. The former CBFC member and the actor are expected to start work on their next film together after Sunny’s son, Karan’s debut film, 'Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas', releases this year.

 When contacted, Dwivedi confirmed the news. He said, “Sunny and I are working on another film, but it’s too early to divulge details. It’s an interesting story. When we discussed it, he told me that he wants to complete his son’s debut film before commencing work on our film. 'Mohalla Assi' taught me a lot, but alongside the struggle, I also found a great friend in Sunny. I am glad that through this struggle, I got to know who he really is.”
