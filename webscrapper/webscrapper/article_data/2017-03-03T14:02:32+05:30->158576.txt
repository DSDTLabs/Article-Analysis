 According to reports, the alleged attack took place on the city’s VIP Road, leading up to the  , where Dutt was shooting for the film but left as soon as the incident took place. Media personnel had stated that they were covering the traffic snarl in the area which they claimed was because of the shoot.
 
 A video that has surfaced on social networking platforms shows the commotion breaking out on the streets. A few policemen and film crew personnel can be seen trying to break up the angry mob and keep them away from the sets.

 Early this week, director Omung was forced to halt the film’s shoot after a large group of fans, who came to catch a glimpse of Dutt, turned rather unruly. A source from the unit later shared that they did not expect the crowd to get out of hand, considering they had beefed up the security on the sets, including the state police force deployed on location. 
 
 ‘Bhoomi’ marks Dutt’s comeback to films after last making a cameo in the 2014 Aamir Khan starrer ‘PK’.
