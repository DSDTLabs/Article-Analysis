PANAJI: Suggesting that the BJP appeared ignorant of the Constitution, the state   unit challenged BJP MP Narendra Sawaikar to state under which provision of the Constitution the cabinet advisory committee (CAC) had been constituted. The Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) continued to insist that the   has no constitutional sanctity and hinted it could intensify its opposition to its functioning. “The CAC is not a substitute for the chief minister,”   spokesperson and advocate Yatish Naik said. Naik said that the CAC was not empowered to make any policy decisions, which reflected in the failure of the current coalition government to address the mining crisis.
