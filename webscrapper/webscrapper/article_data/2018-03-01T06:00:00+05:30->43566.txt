Various junior colleges in Hyderabad were bustling with activities early on Wednesday as   got underway in the state. From an early hour, both parents and their wards were seen making a beeline to various examination centres with looks of nervousness on their faces. 

 Long before the gates were opened, many could be seen biting away their fingernails as they sat clutching their heads in their hands engrossed in last-minute-preparations. The parents looked equally tensed as many passed on last-minute tips to their children.
 
 Once the gates were opened, momentary chaos and confusion erupted among the students as they looked for their allotted rooms according to their roll numbers. Many could be seen running from one room to another reading through the roll number lists affixed on the doors. There were also some late comers, thanks to the city’s maddening traffic during the peak hours. “This is our first exam and that too it’s Sanskrit. I don’t know what I am going to write as it’s a language I never spoke in my life,” said   from the   college.
 
 There were also some like Afroz, who were well prepared. “My subject is Arabic and I am well prepared for it. However, like always, I am a little tensed thinking about the question paper,” said Afroz.
 After the students were seated in their respective rooms, a sense of calm descended on the faces of parents who patiently waited outside the centres for the exam to finish. “More than the exam, it’s the chaos of finding the roll number in the list which is worrisome,” said a parent.
