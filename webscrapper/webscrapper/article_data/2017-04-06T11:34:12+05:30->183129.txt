MUMBAI: A   attacked a pregnant woman in a compartment reserved for disabled people between   and Virar on Tuesday.

  Anita Sohoni, a Dahisar resident, said, “I boarded a slow Virar local for Dahisar from Goregaon at 6.30pm. I got into the disabled coach as I am four months pregnant. At Goregaon, a woman and a child boarded the train and began abusing commuters.” 
 
 CR and WR have permitted pregnant women to travel in coaches reserved for handicapped.
 
 Sohoni said the woman stood at the door, blocking it. When others told her to move, she got angry. “She pinched them. She scratched my hand and bit me. I called up the helpline, but it wasn’t reachable.” 
 
 Commuters said they looked for police on the platform at each station but could not spot any. At Dahisar, Sohoni approached a cop who asked her to go to the   GRP station. “There, the station master refused to note my complaint. I was taken to a medical room, where they gave me first aid,” she said. 
 
 Sohoni said she could connect to the helpline only after reaching Dahisar. Senior divisional security commissioner ( ), WR,   said, “An inspector has got in touch with her and we are helping her register an FIR.” He said they have intensified drive against those blocking compartment doors and travelling illegally in disabled coaches. On why the helpline did not work, he said, “That was unlikely as there are five lines.”
