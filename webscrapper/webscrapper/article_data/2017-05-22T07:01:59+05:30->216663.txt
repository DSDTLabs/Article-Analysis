MEERUT:   has hit work at the busy   (RTO) here. The   say while the   issued from the office has increased multifold, 70% of the   are yet to be filled.
 
 The office issues around 150 licences each day but no new employees have been recruited. There are a total of 54 sanctioned posts at the RTO — 42 clerks and inspector-level officers, eight peons, two watchmen and two sweepers — but only 18 people man the office.
 
  “With a limited staff, it is getting very difficult to operate quickly, thereby delaying the service that has to be provided to the people who come to the office. The main problem is that the existing clerks and other staff who have to deal with paper work are neither well-versed with computers nor aware of the old files which are kept in the store,” said Ranjeet Singh, assistant regional transport officer (administration).
 
  Against the vacancy of 42 clerks and inspector-level officers, only 14 people have been employed while four people are employed on the eight posts of peons. However, the office has neither a watchman nor a sweeper.
 
  “The government talks about Swachch Abhiyan, but does not give any sweepers to the department. How can one expect the RTO premises to be clean if there are no sweepers in the first place,” said an RTO official who did not wish to be identified.
 
  Officials further say that they have written to the higher authorities about the vacancies but to no avail. “We have written to the higher officials informing about the vacancies but there has been no response so far. There is little we can do in such a situation. The ones working are already putting in all their efforts to keep the department work going,” said KP Gupta, regional transport officer (enforcement).
