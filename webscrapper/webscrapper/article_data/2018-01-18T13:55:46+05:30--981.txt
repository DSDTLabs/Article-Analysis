PUDUKKOTTAI: In yet another instance of bulls going berserk beyond the jallikattu arena and even the collection point, a 45-year-old man was gored to death by a charging bull at   in   district on Wednesday. 

 The victim, identified as M   of Kovilpatti in Pudukkottai, was the first casualty of the season’s bull-taming sports in the district, but overall, the fifth in the state. 
 
 A flower merchant by profession,   was walking on the open ground when a bull charged at him from behind. 
 
 He sustained grievous injuries in his neck and was rushed to the Pudukkottai government hospital for treatment. However, he succumbed to his injuries within minutes of reaching the hospital as he had lost excess blood. Onlookers say that Jeeva saw the bull approaching only at the last minute. “He seemed to bend down for a moment in front of the bull but this only enraged the animal which crashed into his neck. He could have been alive had he fallen flat on the ground,” said a spectator. 
 
 Sub-collector K M   told   that the incident didn’t come to the notice of the medical team stationed at the jallikattu arena as it happened outside the collection centre. The victim was taken to hospital in a private ambulance. 
 
 She said that apart from police personnel, volunteers were deployed for about 100 metres on either side of the bull running area. A V-shaped collection centre is set up at the end of this area enabling the owner to catch hold of his bull. 
 
 However in this case, “the bull owner failed to catch hold of the bull which went out of control and charged at the victim,” said the sub-collector. While an inquiry was on to ascertain the circumstances that led to the killing of the spectator, she said that they were awaiting the post-mortem report which could give a clearer picture. Meanwhile, as many as 522 bulls and 192 bull tamers took part in the jallikattu event on Wednesday which saw a total of 22 tamers sustaining injuries.
