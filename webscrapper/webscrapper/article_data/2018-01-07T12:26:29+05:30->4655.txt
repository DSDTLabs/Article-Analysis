SURAT: While the   state unit on Saturday elected   as the Leader of the   (CLP) in  ,   got the message only when he landed in Diamond City from Delhi on Saturday night. 

 Talking to the media persons at the airport, Dhanani said, “I got the message of my selection as the CLP leader in Gujarat assembly from my friends who had come to receive me on the airport tonight. I have come here to attend a private programme and will be leaving for Amreli on Sunday morning.”
 
 Dhanani said, “People of Gujarat were in favour of change, they were yearning for freedom from fear, illusion and corruption. But, unfortunately, the BJP used their tactics of power, money and muscle and were successful in forming government in Gujarat.” 
 
 He added, “I am assured that the people of Gujarat have given us a chance to be in a strong opposition in the assembly to voice their anguish. The power of the young force in the opposition will always fight against the fear, illusion and corrupt tactics of the BJP government in the assembly.”
 
 Asked whether he met Congress president   in Delhi on Saturday, Dhanani said, “I have not met Rahulji today. I joined   in 2013 and am continuously working for the party. I am indebted to the party leadership, my MLAs, elders for their blessings.”
