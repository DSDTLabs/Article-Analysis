GAYA: Police launched a massive operation against sand and stone mafia in four districts – Gaya, Aurangabad, Rohtas and Kaimur – on Friday night. Zonal IG   spent the better part of the night on Grand Trunk (GT) Road to monitor the operation.

 Altogether 335 heavily overloaded trucks were seized and 208 persons detained for their alleged involvement in the clandestine trade. The detained persons are being interrogated.
 
 Confirming the crackdown against sand and stone mafia along the Bihar stretch of GT Road (NH-2), the zonal IG said activities of those engaged in the clandestine business were causing immense losses to the state exchequer. “Such raids will continue,” Khan said, adding that illegal sand mining and stone chip transportation was also resulting in damages to roads.
 
 The zonal IG, who is camping in  , said showcause notices have been served on 18 SHOs deputed in police stations located along the GT Road. District magistrates of all the four districts have also been asked to look into the role of government officials, including the commercial tax department personnel, officials of the weight and measurement, forest, mining and  . “Such a big racket cannot go on without the connivance of field officials,” said the IG. Show cause notices have also been issued to four sub-divisional police officers, Khan added.
 
 Earlier, residents of Gaya had demanded complete ban on sand mining in the Falgu river between Bodh Gaya and Bitho as it was causing imbalance in the eco system and adversely affecting the storage and filtration capacity of the river. Though mechanised mining stands prohibited in several areas, the sand mafia was indiscriminately using heavy machinery to lift sand from the riverbed. Several children in the district got drowned in 2016 in deep ditches dug by the sand mafia.
