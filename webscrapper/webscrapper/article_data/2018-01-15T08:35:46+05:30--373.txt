THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: All dental   in   will have to get registration from the state dental council. The government took such a decision after several complaints arose that people with no adequate qualification were opening dental clinics in several parts of the state. The government has decided to give powers to the state   to inspect and scrutinize the   who are running clinics.

 "Several dental clinics are functioning without adequate facilities and safety mechanisms. Several kinds of infections are being reported due to the under-qualified people employed at these clinics and also due to the substandard equipment used to treat patients. To end these unethical practices, the government decided to make the registration mandatory," said a senior health official.
 
 The dental council will have powers to inspect clinics, verify the certificates of people employed at these clinics. Though the Dental Council Act of 1948 prescribes powers for the council to act against clinics, no such strict measures were taken to inspect clinics.
 
 Also, several doctors, who passed courses in other states and registered in dental councils of those states, are practising in Kerala. But, they were not asked to get the recognition of the dental council of Kerala. This has changed now. At present, there are over 20,000 dental surgeons who have registered with the state dental council.
