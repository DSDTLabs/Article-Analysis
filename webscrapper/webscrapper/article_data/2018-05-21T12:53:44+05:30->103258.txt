AURANGABAD: Ten days after   police ordered an inquiry into the role of cops in the communal riots that rocked the city on May 11 and 12 on the basis of a video, another clip showing policemen shouting “communallycharged” abuses surfaced on social media. The authenticity of the video, however, could not be independently verified.

 
 A 17-year-old boy and a senior citizen were killed while 60 people, including 31 police personnel were injured, in the communal violence in Aurangabad’s old city area. The new clip, a copy of which is with TOI, appears to have been shot from one of the houses in   in the early hours of May 12. It shows policemen firing from their self-loading rifles, abusing the residents of the area and then challenging them to come out of their houses.
 
 When contacted, SIT chief and deputy commissioner of police (headquarters)   said they are investigating the video and the accused would soon be identified.
 
 “It is very embarrassing that our policemen are found to be showering communal abuses and shielding the rioters. Whether complainants come forward or not, we will initiate action against the guilty policemen,” said a senior police officer. Residents of the area have alleged that several rounds were fired and several caps of empty cartridges were found on the road the day after. They added that fearing the threats, they remained indoors, while the rioters continued to torch their vehicles and property. The policemen later left the spot.
 
 The previous clip also hinted at cops’ complicity in the violence as if showed them accompanying rioters who were torching vehicles and property. When contacted, residents of the area alleged that the men were from the city police force not from the  .
 
 “These policemen caught on camera are the same men in the earlier video who were walking towards Jinsi. These men belong to the same group of policemen who, along with rioters, torched the vehicles and property in our area,” said a resident.
