CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh was ranked as the third cleanest city in the country in the Swachh Survekshan 2018 results released on Wednesday, a huge improvement from its dismal 11th position last year.

 The cities were assessed on three main segments and given marks. These were checking of the documents of the MCs, Swachhta App and public feedback and physical inspection or verification of various sites. The exact details of marks in each components were yet to be released by the Central government. Chandigarh had lagged in the public feedback segment in 2017, drawing huge criticism. As a result, the civic body this time put optimum efforts in this segment by engaging employees of the MC irrespective of the fact they were working in which department.
 
  
  
 
 “The MC managed to connect with around 36,000 people with the Swachhta app and used other multiple feedback means like advertisements and interactions with public, residents welfare associations and markets welfare associations. Special teams visited colleges and educational institutes to engage youth to download the Swachhta app. All this worked for us,” said an official of the MC.
 
 Teams of the Central government had stayed in the city for physical inspection for over a month and scrutinized areas, mainly slums, periphery, markets and other public areas to get the exact status of sanitation.
