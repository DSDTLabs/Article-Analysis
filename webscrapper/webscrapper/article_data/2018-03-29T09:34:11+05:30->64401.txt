NDORE: Removal wing of Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) on Wednesday demolished residential structures of seven notorious criminals. 

 The drive was a part of an initiative taken up jointly by civic body and police department to discourage goons from getting involved in criminal activities. 
 
 The drive which began around 11 am was carried out by a team of 200 IMC workers and officials who were equipped with four earth moving machines and dumpers. Seven structures including four permanent and three temporary houses were removed in the drive. 
 
 The drive was carried out in listed areas under zone 12 and zone 2. While four constructions were demolished in Juni Indore area, remaining three were razed down by IMC team in Raoji Bazaar, Pandrinath and Chhatripura areas. 
 
 Houses of criminals –   of Palda Colony, Rajesh alias Gabbar of Jabra Colony, Arjun of Triveni Colony, Prahalad alias Gotu of Harijan Colony, Rajesh alias Chhu of Harijan Colony, Sonu of Luniapura, and Ramnath of Aada Bazaar, were demolished. 
 
 IMC officials said power supply to the structures was disconnected before the drive that continued for more than seven hours. 
 
 IMC’s deputy commissioner   said that goons have over a dozen criminal cases registered against them. “We had also issued notices to the occupants of all the seven constructions, which were raised illegally. As occupants were not ready to clear them, we went ahead and removed their constructions,” he said. 
 
 IMC team also had to face opposition from occupants who alleged that IMC of impartial action. “There are many other notorious criminals in our area, why they are targeting our constructions,” alleged one of the occupants during the removal drive in Juni Indore area.
