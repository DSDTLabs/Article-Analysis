CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh district court on Monday framed   against the owner of a private company in the IT Park, who was arrested in a case of sexual harassment with a woman employee at his office.

  Kohli, who is also the director of the IT company, along with another were also booked for assaulting policemen. The trial in this matter would start from the next date of hearing.
 
 The court framed charges under Sections 294 (Obscene acts and songs), 354(Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354b (Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe)
 
 The matter dates back to December 9, 2017 when the police registered a case against Sahil after receiving a complaint from a woman employee at his office.
 
 The complainant had alleged that the accused sexually assaulted her. Later head constables Shubhkaran and   of the IT Park police station had gone to probe the case against Sahil. The police had gone to tell the accused to join the investigation. But, he had refused to do so. Later, Sahil and his brother Saumil reportedly agreed to go to the police station on the condition that they would go in their own car. On their way to the police station, the accused brothers allegedly took a detour and took the car to Shastri Nagar in Kishangarh, nearly 5 kms away from the police station. When cops chased them down, the brothers entered into a fight with the policemen. Though policemen were suspended for thrashing Sahil and his brother, the duo were later booked for assaulting the cops.
 
 On January 5, the district court has dismissed the bail application of the 25-year-old IT company owner   in a sexual harassment case. Kohli had already been denied a bail before.
