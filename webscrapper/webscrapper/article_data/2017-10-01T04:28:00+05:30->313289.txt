Ahmedabad: The Indian epic of Ramayana also resonates with Indonesians strongly as the tale of Rama, Lesmana, Sinta along with Anomana has enthralled generations. It is a hugely popular drama especially in centers such as Bali, Java and Jakarta with their own interpretation of the epic.

 Gujarat will witness the first ever Ramayana performance by an Indonesian group on September 30 to coincide with Dussera at the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Auditorium near SG Road. The Indonesian consulate said that the epic and ballet inspired by it talks about integration and thus has remained relevant after all these years. “The epic is integral part of Indonesia’s social fabric and has transcended religious boundaries. Out of the troupe of about 40 artists, a large number follow Islam but they equally revere the universal tale,” said Saut Siringoringo, the consul general of the Republic of Indonesia in Mumbai.
 
 
 Cinta Rizkia Hervitaniar, who plays Sinta (Sita) in the ballet, said that she finds the character very inspiring as she is beautiful but strong, gentle but firm. “I feel honoured to play the part,” she said. The make-up for the act takes about three hours. 
 
 Novian Musthofa, who plays Anoman (Hanuman), said that there are so many roles Hanuman plays in the epic. “I find him one of the strongest characters. I developed a distinct voice to play the part,” he said.
