CHENNAI:   MR Vijayabaskar said despite the indefinite strike by the labour unions in Tamil Nadu, 75% of the government transport services are operating. “We will ensure cent per cent operation from Tuesday onwards,” the minister said.

 While reviewing the services in the city, Vijayabaskar announced that all eligible driving licence and conductor licence holders can approach the nearby transport depot and they would be prioritised for recruitment. The temporary recruitment from Tuesday will be purely on daily wages. “Only experienced will get the job,” the minister said.
 
 Metro rail has announced a 40% fare discount and southern railways has announced special unreserved, reserved and suburban trains on Monday following state government’s request.
 
 Vijayabaskar said the government has issued an order sanctioning Rs 750 crore towards retirement benefits accumulated over two decades, and the rest would be disbursed in a phased manner. A sum of Rs 496 crore will be credited on Wednesday itself, and dearness allowance for the period of eight months to the tune of Rs 79 crore has also been credited to the accounts two days ago.
 
 “I myself attended five rounds of talks with the labour unions and requested them to give up their protest plan. But DMK’s Labour Progressive Front, CITU and other labour unions are resorting to strike with an agenda for political gains. Only 10 unions are striking and 37, including AIADMK’s Anna Thozhirsanga Peravai, stay with government,” the minister said.
 
 Vijayabaskar said the sentiments of the labourers are respected and the retirement benefits would be released in a phased manner.
