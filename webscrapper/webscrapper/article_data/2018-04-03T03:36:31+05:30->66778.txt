NEW DELHI: Taking suo motu cognisance of the board exam question paper leaks,   has issued notices to the  , CBSE chairperson and the   commissioner asking them for an explanation within four weeks.

 The commission has stated that authorities have “failed to keep the faith of students intact”. 
 
 It has asked the HRD ministry to inform the commission about the steps taken regarding counselling of the aggrieved students and to make the process of conducting board examinations trustworthy and foolproof to avoid recurrence of such incidents. 
 
 Observing that such instances would adversely affect the credibility of the institutions, NHRC said, “The students have been undergoing trauma engulfed with helplessness, heart break and mental agony during examinations days. The parents and the teachers try their best to counsel and motivate them to remain calm and confident”.
 
 “Several government and non-government agencies, including the media also contribute to impart ancillary support to the students to deal with the anxiety attached to the board examinations. In spite of all the best efforts made by every stakeholder, if the preparations done by the students go in vain due to such demoralising and unexpected incidents like  , it would definitely shatter the enthusiasm of the young aspiring students,” said NHRC.
 
 So far, six students have been detained in Jharkhand, several others, including administrators of some WhatsApp groups, coaching centre’s owners and tutors have been questioned while three teachers have been arrested and an official of the CBSE has been placed under suspension.
