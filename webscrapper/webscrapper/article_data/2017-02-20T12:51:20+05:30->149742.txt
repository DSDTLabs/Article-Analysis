After one of the prominent actresses of Mollywood was sexually assaulted, a lot of hullabaloo has been brewing up on why the leading actors are not expressing their thoughts on their social networking sites. The blame goes to  , Mohanlal and   who usually go effusive about socially relevant issues. 

 Mohanlal has always been known for his socially concerned blogs and as he usually writes it on the 21st of every month, fans are eagerly waiting for his comments. Trolls were aimed at Mammootty and Nivin Pauly when they posted in favour of Jallikettu, saying that they are posting it to gain support of the Tamilians as they are planning to spread their wings to Kollywood!
 
 Many actors say that they are now in a catch-22 situation where even if they do not want to air their opinion on social networking sites, they are forced to do it as the society now demands keyboard activists than empathising and supporting the one, who has gone through trauma in real.
 
 
 
 When quizzed a popular actor on why isn't he posting anything in support of his colleague who was sexually assaulted, he replied, "I called her up and expressed my solidarity. I do not think I should put my heart out on my social media pages to prove that I am in deep pain and empathise with her. I never wanted to be an activist or a warrior but just another human being, who can feel his neighbour's pain!"
 
 A leading lyricist from the industry expressed his helplessness saying, "I am shocked and have no words to express my disturbance but I am expected to write something on my page, which I really do not want to do. I neither know the reality nor the facts!"
