 “All the DMs and SPs have been issued directives in this regard,” said Board chairman   on Wednesday and added free and fair examinations would be the responsibility of the DMs, who will be the chief controllers of examinations in their respective districts.

They have also been directed to ensure proper frisking of examinees, including that of girls by women cops.
 
 In case of cancellation of any examination, the DM concerned will send a report citing reasons to the BSEB. “There were instances when the centre superintendents did not report irregularities immediately. Now they have to send their report every day to the DM concerned,” said Kishor.
 
 The DMs have also been asked to call a meeting of police officers and discuss the deployment of forces, including stationary force, flying squad and patrolling party. One magistrate with a patrolling party will look after four centres, he said.
 
 Kishor has asked the DMs to ensure that the executive magistrates have powers under the Bihar Conduct of Examination Act, 1981 to punish examinees involved in malpractices. The DMs have also to prevent teachers and staff of the same school from invigilation duty.
 
 Earlier, examinees used to keep their books and guides outside the examination hall, but now no one will be allowed to carry books or bags inside the examination centres.
