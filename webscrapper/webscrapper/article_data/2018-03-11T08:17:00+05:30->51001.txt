 ‘Trend not good for party or country’
 
 Azamgarh SP (rural) NP Singh said, “An FIR against unidentified persons has been registered. People involved in vandalizing the statue would be nabbed soon.” Burhanpur tehsildar   said a new statue of Ambedkar would be installed in place of the damaged one.
 
 In Aurangabad, Savarkar’s statue situated near a makeshift police control room was vandalized, causing much embarrassment to the administration.
 
 Without naming BJP, fourterm Shiv Sena MP Chandrakant Khaire said after the new government came to power, statues of   were pulled down in Tripura and this had resulted in a spate of defilement of statues of great people across the country. “The trend is neither good for the political party, nor for the country,” he said.
 
 In Patna, Rijiju told reporters that the Centre had issued an advisory to state governments to take strong action against those found guilty of damaging statues of leaders.
