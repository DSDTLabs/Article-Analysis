AHMEDABAD: Gujarat’s social justice and empowerment minister   said on Wednesday that Dr   choses Buddhism over  . Parmar was speaking at a function held for giving away of an award named after Ambedkar, on Buddha Purnima. 

  “Babasaheb had declared that he did not wish to die in the same religion in which he was born. Many years later, Hyderabad’s Nawab came and offered him Rs 700 crore. Christians also approached him but Babasaheb refused all of them. He chose to convert to Buddhism which had its origins in Hinduism,” Parmar said.
 
 Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani endorsed Parmar's statement. 
 
 “As mentioned by Atmarambhai in his speech, Babasaheb was born a Hindu but was frustrated with untouchability. Hence he did not want to die as a Hindu,” Rupani said. 
 
 Many people from different religions invited Ambedkar to embrace their faith. “But   had decided to embrace Buddhism, which is a historical decision,” Rupani said.
