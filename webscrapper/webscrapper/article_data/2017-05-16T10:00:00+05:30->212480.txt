There is often the misconception that heartburn is related to heart.

 In spite of its name, heartburn which means acid reflux, it has relevance with esophagus. But since the esophagus and heart are positioned close enough, either one can be related to chest pain which is the reason many individuals confuse heartburn for angina and the other way around.
 
 
 
 
 Heartburn is a typical condition created by stomach acids ascending into your throat. This can bring about chest pain that occasionally transmits to your neck, throat or jaw.
 
 
 
 
 When the symptoms dissipate on burping, chances are most likely that it is not related with the heart but with the esophagus. However, presence of shortness of breath or sweating is indicative of a heart-related issue. But, everyone is different, and not all signs are caused by one or the other.
 
 
 
 
 If you are unsure whether it is heartburn or heart attack, look for therapeutic consideration immediately. It's anything but difficult to confound the two issues so let a specialist preclude the most serious probability. This is a particularly critical message for ladies, who tend to call for help for others and neglect themselves.
 
 
 
 
 Avoid liquor, smoking, anti-inflammatory drugs, and citric fruits which may otherwise open the valve and cause acid back flow to the throat. In case indigestion happens at bed time, gravity can come handy if one sleeps with head raised higher so that the acid remains in the stomach. One must also avoid eating late at night and let the food be digested before hitting bed. Over-the-counter medicines like antacids may help to reduce the symptoms. Always consult the doctor to figure out the cause of the symptoms.
