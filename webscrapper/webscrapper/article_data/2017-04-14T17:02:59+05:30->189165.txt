Even though Salman Khan’s ‘Tubelight’ is set for an Eid release this year, the film’s makers have not released a teaser or a trailer yet. The film's director   opened up about his plans for the trailer's release. Kabir said that the trailer of the film will get released in May and the teaser will make its appearance by the end of April. 

 Kabir also said that he doesn’t believe in extended periods of marketing months before the film’s release, but only closer to the release.
 
 Kabir further stated that he doesn’t believe in going berserk with marketing as long as he’s able to get his message out and inform the viewers about the film’s release date. Kabir added that he won’t disclose much about the film and he’d rather let people discover the message of the movie through the trailer.
 
 Previously, Salman and Kabir have worked together in ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ and ‘Ek Tha Tiger’.
