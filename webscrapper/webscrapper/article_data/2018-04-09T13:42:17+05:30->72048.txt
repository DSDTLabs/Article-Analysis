MARGAO: Four days after Eurico  , 21, from  , Salcete, was allegedly abducted and assaulted, the Maina-Curtorim police on Sunday claimed to have made a ‘breakthrough’ in the case by arresting an uncle-nephew duo.

 Maina-Curtorim PI Pravin Kumar Vast said, “The accused, identified as Xavier Fernandes and his nephew,   Fernandes, were arrested on Saturday night.” There will be more arrests, said   SDPO Dy SP Raju Raut Dessai. The police action came a day after former Nuvem MLA Francisco   addressed the media along with Oliveira’s relatives in Margao, demanding for a thorough investigation.   sought that justice be provided to the family that had approached him being their former legislator.
 
  He informed the media about an incident of theft at a house in Lotoulim on March 30 when the owners of the house were attending Good Friday rituals. “The complainant, Anthony Fernandes, had challenged the police that if they failed to nab the culprits, he would do the needful.” Oliveira was allegedly kidnapped and assaulted by five-six men the same day. He managed to escape and was treated at a hospital for his injuries. He claimed the men demanded that he give back the gold ornaments stolen from his neighbour Anthony’s house.
