GURUGRAM: Commonwealth Games winner   is miffed with the news going around that she was insulted during a felicitation ceremony held in Dadri on Tuesday.

 The   winner went on to say that this is wrong reporting and it should be stopped. “Why do journalists go to any extent to create a sensational news? This I believe they do when they can’t get a story. Such type of wrong propaganda should be stopped,” said Bhaker. The ceremony was conducted to honour medal winners at the   from Haryana. In her first Commonwealth Games, 16-year old Manu Bhaker won India's first gold medal in   in the women's 10m Air Pistol event.
 
  
  
 
 Manu’s father   was also miffed with the entire episode. 
 
 “Such reporting should be banned. We give respect to our elders and this is what my daughter has done too. She was not insulted. Don’t add misery to what she has got for this country. Learn to respect your elders like Manu does. Salute her and don’t point fingers at her or the people who felicitated her.”
