NEW DELHI: Three associates of gangster Naveen Bhanja, who had shot at the owner of an eatery in   for refusing to pay extortion money, were arrested on Friday. 

 The owner, Gagan Babu, had earlier informed the police about the threat call he received from the gang asking him to pay the amount. After he refused to pay, Bhanja, who is currently lodged in Tihar Jail, sent his men to teach him a lesson.
 
 DCP (southeast)   said the accused, Subeg Singh Shibbu, Pradeep Dabas and Sharwan, were caught by a police team from   in outer Delhi. They have recovered two sophisticated pistols from their house. 
 
 “Shibbu was close to Bhanja and had met him a few times in jail. He had earlier tried to extort money from a jeweller in Lajpat Nagar as well,” said DCP Biswal.
 
 During interrogation, Shibbu told police that he was a financier and was running an office at Lajpat Nagar. Last year, he was cheated by Aniruddh, a resident of Najafgarh. When Shibbu tried to confront him, he got a threat call from Bhanja. After this encounter, Shibbu met Bhanja in jail and decided to work for him, police said.
 
 Shibbu told police that after the jeweller, Sachin Babbar, refused to pay the amount, he had thrashed him with snooker sticks at a pool bar in Lajpat Nagar. Shibbu wanted to create his own extortion racket at the Lajpat Nagar market. 
 
 On March 28, Shibbu and his associates opened fire at Babbar near the eatery to scare the the its owner and extort money from him later. The bullet, however, had missed Babbar and hit the owner, Babu, instead. 
 
 Babu is currently undergoing treatment and is critical, police said.
