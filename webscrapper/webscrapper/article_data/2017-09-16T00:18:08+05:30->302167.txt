Manohar Parrikar’s absence from the Fifa U-17 World Cup winner’s trophy unveiling proved to be a disappointment but sports minister Manohar ‘Babu’ Azgaonkar tried to make up for the chief minister’s absence at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Friday.
 
  Parrikar was expected to unveil the trophy but abstained at the last minute. The organisers said a review meeting was also rescheduled.
  
  It was left to the sports minister to unveil the trophy and also appeal to Goans not to give this “wonderful opportunity” a miss.
  
  “The world’s best young players will be taking part and in Goa we will have powerhouses like Germany, Iran, Brazil, Niger and Costa Rica. We Goans have   in our blood and the tournament provides us with a wonderful opportunity. I don’t think any football lover will want to miss these matches,” said Azgaonkar.
  
  Goans will have the chance to be part of the trophy experience for the next four days. Starting Saturday, the trophy will be showcased at the Rosary ground in Navelim from 9.30 am at a Mission XI Million festival that will see children from schools across Goa participate in several fun activities and small sided games. The trophy will also be displayed at the Inox Courtyard on Sunday from 3pm to 8 pm.
