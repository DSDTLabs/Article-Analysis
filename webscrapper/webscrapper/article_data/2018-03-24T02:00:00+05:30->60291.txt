PATNA: More than 200 non-resident Biharis participated in   celebrations organized by the Bihar Jharkhand Association of North America (BJANA) in collaboration with the Consulate General of India-New York (CGINY) for the first time on March 18.

 Several events to mark the 106th anniversary of the state’s foundation day are also being held in other foreign countries, including the UAE, Japan and Qatar.
 
 “Bihar Foundation — a state government initiative — coordinates with its chapters to organize Bihar Diwas celebrations across the globe from March 22 to 24. We have been informed that a number of programmes are going to be held in different parts of the world where Biharis reside,” Bihar Foundation’s chief executive officer and state industries department principal secretary S Siddharth told TOI on Friday.
 
 Sources claimed that Biharis living in other states like Mumbai and Bengaluru also come together and organize events like seminars and cultural activities on Bihar Diwas.
 
 Homemaker Medha Verma, who lives with her husband and kid in Dubai, came to Patna a day before the Bihar Diwas celebrations began. “Celebrating Bihar Diwas is a proud feeling for people like us who live abroad. It brings us together and gives us an opportunity to show others what Bihar means to us,” she said.
