AHMEDABAD: Chain snatchers, used to targeting women on city roads, snatched a gold chain along with a mangalsutra of deputy mayor   on Saturday night, when she was returning from a wedding function in Usmanpura. Vadaj police reached the crime spot and started investigation after Sutariya called them up and complained that two scooter-borne persons had snatched her gold chains worth Rs 70,000.

 Speaking to TOI, Sutariya said that she had been to Aman Party Plot near   in Usmanpura to attend a wedding in her brother’s family on Saturday evening. “ I had just walked out of the event at about 8.30 pm when two men came on a scooter from dimly-lit road towards me. Before I could understand what was happening, the pillion rider lunged at me and snatched my gold chain along with a mangal sutra,” she said.
 
 While she resisted, her mangal sutra was broken into two parts, one of which was taken away by the snatchers while the other part fell on the road. Apart from this, the snatchers had already taken her chain. While she began shouting for help, the duo zoomed off. 
 
 “It was indeed a scary experience. It is a direct assault on a woman and steps should be taken to prevent such crimes,” said Sutariya.
 
 “ I am going to bring the incident to the notice of the city civic authority. Police should deploy staff, especially at wedding venues and social gatherings, which are spots clearly vulnerable to such crimes,” said Sutariya.
 
 While Vadaj police officials did not respond to repeated calls about the complaint, Sutariya said that she has estimated value of the snatched chains between Rs 60,000 and Rs 70,000. 
 
 Three to four chain snatching incidents are reported in the city per week, especially in western city parts. While city police have formed special teams to tackle bike-borne youths involved in such offences, the rate of detection remains low.
