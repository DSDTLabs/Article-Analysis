 (West Godavari): Even as Dalits face social ostracism for the last three months at Garagaparru in West Godavari district, a team of three ministers from the AP cabinet descended on the village offering them houses, roads and individual toilets on Monday.

 Ministers Nakka Ananda Babu, K S Jawahar and Pitani Satyanarayana, SC Finance Corporation chairman Jupudi Prabhakara Rao and local legislator Vetukuri Sivarama Raju held a meeting with the Dalits. They explained to the Dalits the measures being taken by the government to for their welfare and that the prime accused in the case were arrested. But, the ministers had no answer when the Dalits shot back saying the arrested accused were released on bail.
 
 The ministers promised to provide funds through the SC Finance Corporation, SC Sub Plan and the general welfare programmes. They listed out the names of Dalit leaders like G M C Balayogi, K Pratibha Bharati and A Mahendranath who were promoted by the TDP since its inception in 1983 and claimed that the TDP has greater concern and commitment for the Dalits than the other parties. They blamed the social groups and other political parties for misleading the Dalits.
 
 The government is ready to provide permanent houses, lay cement concrete roads in the village and provide individual toilets for every household in the Dalit colony, the ministers said and promised to organise skill training programmes for them apart from creation of assets for livelihood.
 
 They said that the sensitive issue should be handled carefully without creating a rift between the Dalits and other castes. The local legislator said that the villagersâ€™ sentiments were badly hurt and the government is ready to reinstall the statue of Ambedkar in the village and extend all benefits that are due for the Dalits.
