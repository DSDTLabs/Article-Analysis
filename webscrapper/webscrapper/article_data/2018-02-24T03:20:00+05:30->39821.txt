Panaji: The family of the woman police constable whose death has been registered as a case of unnatural death, alleged that one of the police sub-inspectors posted in Mormugao taluka is involved in her death. They have demanded that he be suspended immediately. The family of Harshala Parsekar has demanded that the sub-inspector be taken into custody to ensure a fair and an impartial inquiry. Parsekar had died after consuming poison on February 4. Alleging that he “physically, mentally and sexually exploited” Parsekar, the sister of the deceased, Veena Parsekar Naik said that the sub-inspector intentionally lured her sister by making false marriage promises and “used his authority and power as a senior officer, and then eliminated her when he found her to be a hurdle when he wanted to marry another girl.” The family said that despite the police sub-inspector being named in the complaint, the police has still not arrested him. “If the police say it is a case of suicide, they must show us the evidence to prove this and tell us the reason for this (suicide),” Naik said. The family has requested the police to gather the entire chat history, WhatsApp messages, photos and videos from the phone records of the deceased as well as the police sub-inspector, from the mobile service-provider. This, they said, will help establish the truth. Both mobile phones of the deceased were handed to the police by her family.
