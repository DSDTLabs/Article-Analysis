KOLKATA: Days ahead of a proposed meeting between   and chief minister Mamata Banerjee over fielding a secular candidate for the presidential polls,   Pradesh Congress president   Chowdhury wrote to the Congress president against taking this understanding with Trinamool Congress beyond the presidential polls.

 Chowdhury wants to continue with the no-alliance policy with Trinamool in West Bengal, while he has nothing against roping in all the opposition parties over the presidential polls. 
 
 Alleging TMC was soft on BJP-RSS, he complained that the ruling party was acting more as an enabler for the saffron brigade in the state. 
 
 In his letter, he alleged that Congress councillors were being intimidated and arm-twisted to defect. 
 
 “In Pujali municipality, Congress councillors had to switch over to TMC. In Raiganj, TMC has engineered defection of five Congress candidates before filing nomination,” wrote Chowdhury. 
 
 He has also pointed to pressure tactics being put in place by Trinamool at Domkal in Murshidabad. Incidentally, Congress had Left Front as an ally in the three municipal areas. 
 
 At a press conference, Congress state general secretary   claimed his party had gained strength in the last state assembly election. “Congress and Left Front secured around 39% of the vote while TMC bagged 45%. This clearly puts Congress and its allies in the state in a much stronger position,” he said.
