RAMESWARAM: Over 4,000 fishermen from Tamil Nadu were on Sunday chased away by the Sri Lankan navy which also snapped the nets of 100 boats for allegedly fishing in their territorial waters off   island. 

 Fishermen from Rameswaram and Mandapam had ventured into sea on Saturday on 800 boats and were fishing near Katchatheevu island when the Lankan navy arrived and told them to leave,   President P   said.
 
 They also snapped the fishing nets of 100 boats before chasing them away, he alleged. He sought Centre's intervention in resolving the contentious issue.
 
 All the fishermen returned to the shore this morning.
 
 The mid-sea incident comes after a spate of detentions of the fishermen this month on charges of fishing in their territorial waters.
 
 On January 4, as many as 13 fishermen from   near Rameswaram were arrested by Sri Lankan authorities for allegedly fishing waters off Katchatheevu island.
