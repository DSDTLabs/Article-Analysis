Madurai: A 60-year-old man was killed on the spot and his relative suffered severe injuries, when the two-wheeler on which the two were travelling, was knocked down by a private bus in Othakadai Junction on the outskirts of the city on Sunday.

 The victims were identified as P Arunagiri from Erumaipatti near Singampunari in Sivaganga district who was killed on the spot, while his relative, M Kathiresan was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he is undergoing treatment. The duo who came to Madurai, were on their way back to Sivaganga, when they were knocked down. 
 
 Based on a complaint from the victims’ relative, Rengasamy, a case was registered with the Othakadai police station. The bus driver P Kannan, 45, of Thirupachethi in Sivaganga district was arrested under various Sections of IPC for rash and negligent driving and causing death by negligence. 
 
 Incidentally, a route bus belonging to the same company was involved in an   due to rash and negligent driving in Ring Road at Mandela Nagar, three months ago. Over 20 passengers were injured when the bus bound to Kamuthi in Ramanathapuram, plunged into a pit. Commuters say that private buses are becoming a menace on the road due to rash and negligent driving by their drivers. 
 
 “Seeing the buses itself creates panic among the commuters, especially in rural areas and on the city outskirts, where they drive recklessly without caring much about the lives of other road users,” said K Sanjeev Kumar, a regular to the city from Tirumangalam. 
 
 This is second accident involving private buses in the last 15 days. Barely a couple of weeks ago, an elderly couple from the city were mowed to death by a private bus in front of the Tirumangalam bus terminal. Chandran, 60, from Vilachery and his wife Jothi, 52, were returning home on June 2 night when the accident took place.
