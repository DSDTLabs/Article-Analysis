GHAZIABAD: A 55-year-old   was shot dead by unidentified assailants in his office in   on Friday morning. The victim has been identified as Naresh Yadav.

 According to the victim’s brother Sunil, Yadav had left his home, which is 600 metres from the office, at 8.30 am with some persons in a car. He was dropped at his office, located near   roundabout, by 10 am.
 
 After a while, the same car returned to the spot and two persons went inside Yadav’s office and allegedly shot him from point-blank range from the back. However, no one from the nearby shops heard any gunshots. The matter came to light after a person from a nearby shop entered his chamber and found Yadav slumped in his chair. 
 
  SSP Vaibhav Krishna, SP (City) Akash Tomar and CO I (City) Manisha Singh rushed to the spot along with a forensic team. Yadav was taken to Fortis Hospital in Noida where he was declared brought dead. “I was at the home when he was killed. We own five shops near Tigri roundabout which have been given on rent. Shopkeepers told me about what happened,” Sunil added.
 
 He said Yadav, who dealt in buying and selling of plots of land, was stressed for the past three-four days over financial issues. “It was quite unusual of him to leave home so early in the morning. Usually, he used to wake up around 9 am and seldom went to the office during the day in summer,” said Sunil. 
 
 SSP Krishna said, “An investigation is on. We are talking to family members. The assailants most probably came in a car.”
