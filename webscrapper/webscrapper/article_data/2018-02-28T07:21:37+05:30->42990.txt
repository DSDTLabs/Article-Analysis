LUCKNOW:   on Tuesday expelled   organising secretary, Sanjay  , for six years for speaking out against the induction of former BSP leader Naseemuddin   into the party. 

 The party had served notice to Dixit and UPCC secretary Awdhesh Singh for openly criticizing Siddiqui's entry into Congress. On Monday, Dixit had submitted his response to the party, saying that while he would continue to serve the party, he was against Siddiqui as he was not the sort of person Congress should have within its fold or someone who could be trusted. He had alleged that while in BSP, Siddiqui had taped phone conversations of party supremo   and was also the "commander" of BSP's loot.
 
 However, not satisfied with his response, the party expelled Dixit. "The decision to induct Siddiqui into the party was taken at the highest level so criticizing it meant questioning party president Rahul Gandhi," said sources. 
 
 In a statement issued by party spokesperson Ashok Singh, the party said Dixit had been publically criticizing the party's decision, making baseless allegations against it and Siddiqui, and instead of communicating with the party through official channel, had chosen to air his discontent on social media which is why he was found guilty of indiscipline.
 
 "Dixit had been found guilty of breaching the party's discipline even in the past. Despite warnings and having apologized as well, he continued with anti-party activities," Singh said.
