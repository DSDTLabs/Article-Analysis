LONDON: Rafael Nadal hit his head on a door frame while executing a pre-match drill a little before he walked onto Court No.1 on Monday. Then, a tad slow and playing from way behind the baseline, he allowed his big-serving opponent   the upper hand in the fourthround clash.

 Nadal dismissed the first as `just a small accident' but rued the second, shaking his head on what turned out to be an evening of hits and misses.
 
 The 31-year-old came back in the third and fourth sets before caving into the pressure of serving second in a crackling decider that had the crowd at the edge of their seats. Nadal has only made the fourth-round twice since 2011, couldn't find a way past the tenacity of the Luxembourger, who held nerve and serve. Muller won 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 15-13 in 4 hours and 48 minutes shutting the door on his opponent in fading light.
 
 “I tried to hang in there. Rafa stepped it up in the third and the fourth sets. Then I told myself, `I'm doing the best I can. I'm playing well. Just hang in there and you're going to get your chances',” Muller said adding, “After I was struggling a bit on my service games in the third and fourth sets, I started playing well on my serve again (in the fifth) and won my games more comfortably.”
 
 Nadal, who was his usual animated self, said, “When you play against a player like him you don't have a lot of rhythm. Also you cannot make mistakes yourself. That's what I did twice, in the first and second sets.”
 
 “I had some important breakpoints, these kind of breakpoints are almost match points,” Nadal said of the fifth set. “I make few mistakes especially one where I went to the net. Easy to say now, but I'm better than him from the baseline, so I probably should not have gone to the net that early. He had chances too in the fifth set, more chances than me. So maybe he deserve it a little more than me.”
