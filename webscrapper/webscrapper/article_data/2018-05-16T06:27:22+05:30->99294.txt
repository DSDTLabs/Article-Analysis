MUMBAI: Central Information Commission ( ) has penalized an   (IMD-Mumbai) official Rs1,000 for denying a substantial part of information to a city   activist and for trying to charge GST on information accessible under the RTI Act. 

 
  Taking note of the harassment to the applicant with various demands, the CIC directed   to pay a token compensation of Rs500 to the applicant within 15 days. 
 
  Chetan Kothari had filed a query on September 9, 2017, seeking details of warnings/red alerts issued by IMD, the reason of such warning/alerts for heavy rain, earthquakes, cyclones, storms, etc, the places for which they were issued, and if they turned out to be true or false.
 
  IMD central public information officer Bishwombhar argued that the application was incomplete. "When I cleared my position through an e-mail on November 2, 2017, he told me to deposit Rs5,808, including Rs886 for GST in advance, as the information was voluminous. I was shocked when told to deposit GST as it never fell under the ambit of either goods or services," he said.
 
  The CIC later issued a show-cause notice to the officer for including GST and telling the activist to pay in advance for furnishing information under the RTI Act. In the order passed on February 5, CIC M Sridhar Acharyulu held that demanding GST was illegal and unreasonable.
 
  Kothari said the order made it very clear that the Rs1,000 should be recovered from Bhishwombar, in-charge of the RTI cell of IMD, Mumbai. The penalty had to reach the commission by July 10.
