 ED officials found that the Gems SEZ was at an isolated place and there were no armed security guards among SEZ security staff and managing with two temporary guards of PNB might make the stock vulnerable. The seized stocks pertain to five units at the SEZ, including Gitanjali Gems, Bezel Jewellery, Nakshatra World Limited, Nakshatra Brands Limited and Gili India Limited.
 
 The Gitanjali group is owned by Mehul Choksi, who was named an accused in the second FIR filed by the CBI in the PNB loan fraud case. Interestingly, two of the top officials of the Hyderabad Gems SEZ were not available for the investigation agencies.
 
  senior manager   told TOI, “All the stock has been shifted to PNB from the SEZ. The work at the SEZ stopped after the seizure on February 16. With the entire stock taken away, we have no hope now of restarting work.”
 
 Employees were continuing their protests on a daily basis at SEZ park demanding that the units be restarted. At least 600 employees lost jobs due to closure of five units at the SEZ spread over 175 acres of land.
