RAJKOT: A branch canal for transporting   water to Tappar dam of   was damaged on Friday in less than a year’s time after it was constructed. The damage has disrupted water supply to towns like Adipur, Anjar, Kandla and some parts of   in Kutch.

 The canal was constructed last year before the state assembly elections were announced. Prime Minister   had inaugurated the ambitious pumping station in  , which is used to pump water into the canal.
 
 
 The branch canal was constructed in Anjar to bring the Narmada water to Tappar dam in May last year. The water flows 15 metre down from the main canal to this sub-canal.
 
 Sources said the water supply into the branch canal started on Wednesday and 500 cusec water per day was being released. The target was to fill the Tappar dam in eight days. But the flow of water damaged the walls and floor of the branch canal on Thursday night itself. It suffered more damage on Friday morning following which the water supply was stopped.
 
 Superintendent engineer of irrigation department M B Kotwal said, “The protection wall at the end of dam and flooring has been damaged and breach in lining is also seen. We did temporary repair work and 200 cusec water supply has started.”
 
 As the protection wall was damaged, the wastage of water was also reported. However, the irrigation department officials said the quantity of water wasted is not known. Sources further said that permanent repair of the canal will take time and the work will start after soil investigation and determining the cause of damage.
