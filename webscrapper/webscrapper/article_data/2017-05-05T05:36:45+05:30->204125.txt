CHENNAI: Ten opposition  , including DMK affiliated LPF and   of   have called for an   from May 15, after talks with the government over a charter of demands, including resolution to delay in extending   and implementing revised pay, failed on Thursday.

 A resolution to this effect was adopted at a meeting of federation of all transport corporation trade unions here on Thursday, a three page statement bearing the signatures of trade union representatives said. “We are forced into a strike to save the transport corporations and protect the welfare of labours... The indefinite strike will commence from May 15. Gate meetings will be organised at all zonal headquarters ahead of the strike on May 9,” the statement added. 
 
 Alleging that post-retirement benefits are not offered to employees, the statement said that about 13,000 workers, who superannuated three years ago, are yet to receive their retirement benefits to the tune of Rs 1,500 crores. Delay in reimbursing subsidies to transport corporations has hit the health of state undertaken corporations, it said, adding that pay revision has not been implemented.
 
 The statement also condemned the absence of transport minister during the talks on Thursday. When contacted, CITU state president A Soundararajan said that a strike notice has been issued.
