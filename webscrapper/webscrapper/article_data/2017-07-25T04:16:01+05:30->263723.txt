ITANAGAR: The Border Roads Organisation ( ), responsible for building and maintaining roads in international border areas, said it would construct two tunnels through the 4,170-metre-high Sela Pass in Arunachal Pradesh.

 This would cut the distance to the   through Tawang by 10km, which is in keeping with India’s bid for faster access to the   frontier through the difficult terrain in the eastern Himalayan state.
 
 RS Rao, commander of the 42 border road task force under BRO’s Project Vartak, has initiated a formal requisition to the West Kameng deputy commissioner Sonal Swaroop for acquisition of land for the tunnel, a BRO release said here on Monday.
 
 “The survey for land acquisition will start after the monsoon,” Swaroop said. The project includes widening of the existing singlelane road to a double-lane National Highway from Baisaki.
 
 From there, a 12.37km greenfield alignment will take off, which will include two tunnels — 475m and 1,790m-long — through the Sela-Chabrela ridge. It will meet the existing Balipara-Chaudur-Tawang road on the Nurarang side.
 
 “The altitude of the new alignment will vary between 11,000 and 12,000 feet,” Swaroop said, speaking from Bomdila, the district headquarters.
 
 “The tunnels will cut at least an hour of travel time between the Army’s 4 Corps headquarters at Tezpur and Tawang. Moreover, the tunnels will ensure that NH-13, especially the 171km stretch between Bomdila and Tawang, remains accessible in all weather conditions,” the release said. It added, “The construction of tunnels... obviates high altitude, steep gradient and hairpin bends on either side of the Sela Pass which would bring relief to commuters as snowfall during winter causes a lot of hardship.”
