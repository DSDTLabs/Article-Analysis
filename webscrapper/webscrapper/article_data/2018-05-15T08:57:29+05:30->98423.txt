PATNA: Vehicles carrying   and stone aggregates will not be allowed to ply on the dilapidated Mahatma   on the Ganga. The ban will become effective within a week.

 Such vehicles, mostly trucks and tractors, will now have to go through either newly constructed Ara-Chhapra bridge or Rajendra Setu at Mokama.
 
 Also, the pontoon bridge under the Mahatma Gandhi Setu will remain open round the clock. As of now, vehicles are allowed to pass through it only from 6am to 6pm.
 
 These decisions were taken at a meeting convened by chief secretary Anjani Kumar Singh on Monday. It was attended by Patna SSP   and SPs of Vaishali, Saran and Bhojpur districts.
 
 Road construction department principal secretary Amrit Lal Meena told TOI it was also decided that heavy vehicles would be allowed to ply on the JP Setu from 10pm to 5am on a pilot basis.
 
 As of now, heavy vehicles are not allowed on the JP Setu between Digha and Sonepur. Vehicular movement commenced on it on June 11 last year.
 
 Meena said a DSP and two inspectors each would be deployed for regulating vehicular movement on the Mahatma Gandhi Setu and JP Setu.
 
 Chief secretary Singh said such measures were to ensure that the ongoing rehabilitation work on the Mahatma Gandhi Setu was not affected.
 
 The superstructure of 35-year-old Mahatma Gandhi Setu is being demolished and triangular steel girders are proposed be erected under the rehabilitation work.

 Union minister Ashwini Choubey and state road construction minister   presided over the bhumi pujan ceremony of four-laning of Bhojpur- Buxar section of Patna-Buxar NH- 84, at Buxar on Monday. 
 
 “PM Narendra Modi laid the stone of Patna- Buxar NH- 84 in August 2015. Work on its Patna-Koelwar and Koelwar-Buxar stretches is underway, while the bhumi pujan for Bhojpur- Buxar stretch was held on Monday,” Nand Kishor said.
