GUWAHATI: The centenary celebrations of  , the state's  , may be held without an   adorning the Sabha president's post in February. 

 Sources said the current vice-president of the apex literary body, Parag Thakur, may soon take charge as the sabha president to ensure successful conduct of the gala event in Sivasagar. The Sabha is facing flak from various quarters for the absence of an elected president ahead of the celebrations. 
 
 "The president's post is prestigious and has been adorned by noted litterateurs since 1917. The Sabha plunged into a crisis after after president   suddenly resigned a few days ago. The absence of a permanent president at this hour is a cause of concern as only a few weeks are left for the Sivasagar event," said a Sabha insider.
 
 The prestigious post of president is vacant after Borah resigned from the coveted post due to an internal rift in the literary body in the end of December last year.
 
 The reception committee of the centenary session has banned Sabha secretary general Paramananda Rajbongshi from joining the gala celebrations, accusing him of being involved in several irregularities after his name figured in the suicide case of Rajendra Nath Dutta, former head assistant-cum-accountant at the Sabha's head office in Jorhat. Though Rajbongshi said he is not guilty, Borah wanted his (Rajbongshi's) ouster. But when the members of the executive committee of the Sabha wanted Rajbongshi to continue as Sabha secretary general, Borah resigned from the president's post. 
 
 Now all eyes are on the crucial Sabha representative meeting to be held on January 8 to decide the future course of action. The highest decision making body of the Sabha is likely to take a call on the new president at the meeting.
