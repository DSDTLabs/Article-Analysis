VARANASI: In a twist to the dispute over control of   in   of the city, a caller from Pakistan reportedly asked the city magistrate hearing the case to reopen the sealed mosque at the earliest. 

 In a report sent toDM and   on Wednesday night, city magistrate Vishram said he received many calls from a Pakistani caller to reopen the Badi Masjid in   area of Varanasi that was sealed in April 2016 following a dispute between Deobandi and Barelvi sects over its control. The magistrate said the caller identified himself as "Adhimal of PML group" and pressurized him to reopen the mosque at the earliest. According to Vishram, a hearing in the dispute between Deobandi and Barelvi sects over control of the mosque was scheduled on March 14. However, he received several calls on his official mobile from number +92-3155061388 on March 12 and 13.
 
 "I received a call on March 13 and the caller disclosed his identity as 'Adhimal of PML' from Pakistan. He asked me to order reopening of the mosque and when I told him that the matter was pending in my court, he said that he would continue to pressurize me till the mosque is opened," the city magistrate said.
 
 During hearing of the case on March 14, the city magistrate enquired about the call from both the parties, but none of them had any idea. Vishram said after verifying the number through Truecaller app, he prepared a report and forwarded it to DM Yogeshwar Ram Mishra and SSP R K   for action. Bhardwaj said, "We are mulling whether an FIR should be lodged or the matter should be handed to other agency."
