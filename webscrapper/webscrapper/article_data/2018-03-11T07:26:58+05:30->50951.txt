CHANDIGARH: Union food processing industry minister   urged Prime Minister   on Saturday to talk to France President   about Sikhs being made to remove their turbans while being photographed for official identification.

 Macron arrived for a four-day visit to India on Friday night. Harsimrat, in a letter to Modi, said she had received repeated requests from the Sikh community settled in France, as well as the Counseil Representatif des Sikhs de France, that a law which required removal of turbans while being photographed for passport, identity card, health card, transport card, driving license or any other identification issued by the French administration, was causing them severe humiliation.
 
 She said this law was also a violation of Sikh tenets, and the Sikh community was confident that the issue could be addressed by the Prime Minister. “Nowhere else in the world were Sikhs subjected to this kind of discrimination,” added Harsimrat. She said there was a need to sensitise the French government about Sikh culture, and explain them the sensitivity of the community on this issue, while asserting that the turban was an integral part of the Sikh identity.
