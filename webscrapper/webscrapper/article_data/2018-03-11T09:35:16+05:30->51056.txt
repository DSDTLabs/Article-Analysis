CHANDIGARH: Despite the enormous startup opportunities to provide solutions for making cities smart, it is difficult for startups to work with the government because they have a pay cycle and it is not easy to get money from the government. This was stated by  ,   and director of Gaia  , who was at   to discuss “cand Their Enormous Startup Opportunities” for the entrepreneurship festival Udyami here on Saturday.

 
 “It is not easy to satisfy the millions of pre-qualification criterion that they have. The tender criteria are prohibitive in many ways because it requires so many years of experience and that specified turnover which startups won’t have. That needs a change and I think some of the governments are changing. It is changing but the change needs to be far more and there needs to be at a bigger scale and the government has to make sure that the payment cycles of all of these schemes like Startup India are conducive to entrepreneurs,” Bipin told TOI.
 
 
 Moreover, talking about the efforts of Chandigarh to become a smart city, Bipin said the   is setting up test beds for smart cities but it has to move from test bed to actual implementation. Bipin, who has also studied the requirements of Chandigarh to become a smart city, said, “Though the administration is setting up test bed, I think it has to move from test bed to the actual implementation. It should move from PEC to a sector and then further.”
 
 
 On filing patents for startups, Bipin, who has his three patents for developing mobile technology, said patenting is a complex process and involves shelling out a lot of money, which the startups don’t have initially. However, he said there are other ways too to secure the intellectual property right of your startup idea.
