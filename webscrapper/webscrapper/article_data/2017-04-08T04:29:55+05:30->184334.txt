NEW DELHI: Tarun Vijay’s comments on south Indians left   squirming with embarrassment on Friday and came at a time when the party is making concerted attempts to enlarge its footprint south of the Vindhyas.

 The party distanced itself from the former MP’s remarks even as several leaders expressed strong reservations.
 
 “It will further embarrass the party. Let him handle it. We are deeply hurt at his selection of words,” a senior leader said.
 
 The Congress latched on to the comments to claim that it reflected BJP’s mindset.
 
 “Subsequent apology will not erase the clearly racist, communal and divisive mindset and the philosophy behind it. It is such slips of the tongue which actually reveal the true mindset. It has frightening repercussions for India,” party spokesman   said.
 
 BJP does not have much presence in southern states, apart from Karnataka, and has been making strenuous efforts to make inroads into Tamil Nadu and   in particular.
 
 After J Jayalalithaa’s death, BJP made no bones about its political interest in Tamil Nadu where it has been working hard to make its presence felt. 
 
 In Kerala, several of its cadres have faced political violence, an issue raised in Lok Sabha on Friday as   and parliamentary affairs minister Ashwini Kumar spoke vehemently about it.
 
 After BJP’s victory in recent assembly polls, Prime Minister  , in his celebratory speech at the party headquarters, had spoken of expansion in the east and south, making it clear that the two regions were top priority. BJP chief   has been equally consistent in his focus on the two regions.
 
 Interestingly, Vijay had extended support to   by joining a protest by Tamil Nadu students in Delhi and termed opponents of the bulltaming sport as “brown viceroys knowing nothing” about India and its culture.
