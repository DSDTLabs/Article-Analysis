PATNA: Industries minister   told the assembly on Thursday that disputed plot of land under   ( ) would not be allotted to any entrepreneur or investor until legal impediments are removed.
 
  Singh was giving government’s reply to the call attention notice of BJP MLA  , who had drawn the attention of the presiding member of the House, Ram Narain Mandal, that BIADA first allotted its disputed plot of land and then cancelled the allotment.
  
  Chaurasia also pointed out that the BIADA had advertised two categories of its plots of land – disputed category and the plots free from legal disputes – and also invited applications from entrepreneurs and investors through the advertisement published on February 4, with the last date for the receipt of applications for allotment of the land as February 27. He sought to know if the disputed plots of land were being allotted.
  
  The minister, in his reply, defended the advertisement of both the categories of land, saying the advertisement was purported to give the status of land under BIADA with complete transparency. He said a decision was taken that only project clearing committee would allot the land, and in no case the BIADA is authorised to allot the land.
  
  Animal husbandry and fisheries resources minister   said the government had allotted Rs 11.99 crore in 2016-17 for the purchase of medicines, of which Rs 8.31 crore has been used by the districts concerned. “The utilisation of the allotted money was 69% till March 16,” the minister added.
  
  Replying another question, agriculture minister Ram Vichar Rai said the state government had not yet decided to promote e-marketing of fruits, as it would lead to issuance of licence and start of the “licence raj” in the state. Rai said the government has already freed the market by its 2006 decision of allowing farmers to sell their produces in any part of the state.
