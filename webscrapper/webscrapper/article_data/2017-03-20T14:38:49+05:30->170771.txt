Prabhudeva is making some noise across Kollywood, Tollywood and Bollywood after he shifted his base to Mumbai. Ever since, the multi-talented actor has been dabbling with acting, direction and choreography. 

 His recent outing, a trilingual -'Abhinetri' along with Tamannaah has gained a good response at the box office. Prabhu is busy with a couple of projects that are lined up throughout the year including one under the direction of Chakri Tholeti, in which he was roped in to play the role of an antagonist. This movie is a trilingual and has Nayanathara in its Tamil and Telugu versions while the Hindi version will have Tamannaah replacing Nayanathara. 
 
 Meanwhile, it is learnt that Prabhudeva has also signed a project that is touted to be an action entertainer and a trilingual as well. The movie will be directed by Sumanth Radhakrishnan, in which the actor will don the role of an Archaeologist. The character is loosely based on that of the Indiana Jones. 
 
 However, any further information about the movie is yet to be known and the unit is currently working on the pre-production procedures of it. Once the cast and crew are finalised, the movie will go on floors from early June.
