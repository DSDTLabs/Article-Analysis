Well-known South Indian actress filed a complaint of sexual harassment, reportedly against a city based businessman. The actor told reporters that the man used vulgar language against her while she was rehearsing for an upcoming event in  , at a dance studio here.

 She said she felt humiliated and shocked. “I decided to approach police because I felt very unsafe,” she said, and added: “I’m an independent working woman and I’d like to work free of any disturbances. So many women like me work independently and we all should feel safe and comfortable. The police have taken up the case.”
  
 A probe is on in the matter, police said. Asked who he was, the actress said she did not know. However she suspects the role of an insider connected to the event. She said, "He knew I was there at that time. That's why I thought it was unsafe because I'm an independent working woman. So there is definitely a close source. That's how he knew I was there at the time. I feel extremely unsafe. Someone involved at the event has only given this information.”
  
 The pretty actress has acted in a number of Tamil and   movies. She was briefly married to a director with whom she had worked in a few projects and the couple later got separated following some issues.
