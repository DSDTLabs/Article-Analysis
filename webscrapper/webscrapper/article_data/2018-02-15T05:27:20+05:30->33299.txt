Supermodel and host   says she doesn't want her son to follow her footsteps into the modelling industry.

 "Being a mom and raising a son... I just don't want him to be a model," Banks told people.com.
 
 The model tried to apply a bit of reverse psychology on her son.
 
 "No actually, let me change that. Baby, I want you to model. I want you to get up and model every single day. Because they rebel right? They rebel. I just think that for guys, being a male model, what does that do to you?" She said.
