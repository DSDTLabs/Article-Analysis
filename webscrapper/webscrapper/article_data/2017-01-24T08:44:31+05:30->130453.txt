NEW DELHI: A   which killed an   on a Delhi road on Monday has once again highlighted the urgent need to pass strong laws to tame potential offenders. The Centre has proposed a hefty increase in penalties for speeding from the present Rs 400 to at least Rs 1,000 or up to Rs 2,000, which is pending in   for approval.

 Speeding has been the single biggest reason of crashes on Indian roads accounting for at least 44% of people dying every year - that's at least 177 people daily. In 2015, speeding caused 47.9% of all road crashes (2,40,463 out of a total 5,01,423 accidents) and 64,633 out of 1,46,133 total deaths. In Delhi, speeding caused 3,148 crashes leaving 640 dead and another 3,382 injured during 2015.
 
 The   introduced in Parliament has enhanced fines for speeding related offences. The fines are double for drivers of medium and heavy vehicles such as mini trucks, trucks and buses.
 
 Repeat offences will attract higher fines and the amendments provide for impounding and suspension of driving licences for second or subsequent offence. The states have also been empowered to increase the penalty up to 10 times in case of every offence.
 
 "Stricter laws with higher penalty for traffic offences and proper enforcement are key to make our roads safe. We have written and appealed to all political parties to pass the Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill during the budget session, which has deterrent provisions against speeding, overloading and other traffic offences," said K K Kapila of  .
 
 In fact, India can learn from Sri Lanka, which recently increased the penalty for seven traffic offences such as speeding and overtaking from a mere 250 Sri Lankan rupees to 25,000 Sri Lankan rupees. The Lankan government has refused to come under any pressure to reduce the fine maintaining that saving lives was more important.
 
 However, they have also put in place stricter provisions to ensure traffic police don't use this provision to exploit drivers, something that has been lacking in India.
