GUWAHATI: In what could set off a chain reaction in the Northeast,   (Isak-Muivah)   has said the   signed with the Centre two years ago recognised the organisation's demand for the   in the region.

 “The historic framework agreement recognises the unique history , identity, sovereignty and territories of the Nagas. It also recognises the legitimate right of the Nagas to integration of all Naga territories,“ Muivah said in his address to NSCN (IM) cadres at Camp Hebron, the group's headquarters in Nagaland, on its `38th Republic Day' on Tuesday .
 
 This is the first time that Muivah has spelt out the crux of the closely guarded framework agreement, a key issue in this year's assembly election in neighbouring Manipur. Should the Centre agree to the integration of Naga areas to establish a `Greater Nagalim', Manipur stands to lose more than 80% of its geographical area.
 
 PM Narendra Modi, in his campaign speech in Imphal last month, had assured the people of Manipur that the Naga accord did not contain anything harmful to the state's territorial integrity.
 
 Assam and Arunachal Pradesh also have Naga inhabitants. NSCN(I-M)'s `Greater Nagalim' also includes parts of Myanmar.
