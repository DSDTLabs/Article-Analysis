GHAZIABAD: Rebel Congress functionary   (52) was ousted from his party for a period of six years on Thursday after he was fielded by the   (RLD) for the Ghaziabad assembly constituency. Khari, a sitting councillor from Ward No. 52 in Vijay Nagar, had filed his nomination for the assembly polls on an RLD ticket on January 24.

 The Ghaziabad district Congress committee issued his expulsion letter addressed to senior office bearers in UP. “Khari had been involved in anti-party activities for quite some time. We had issued him warnings in the past asking him to desist from these activities. However, he had paid no heed to the warnings,” district Congress president Harendra Kasana told TOI.
 
 Khari had filed his nomination soon after the ticket for the Ghaziabad constituency was awarded to K K Sharma, a former NSUI president and AICC secretary. 
 
 On Thursday, Khari, who had been associated with Congress for the past three decades, announced at a news conference in Vijay Nagar that more than two dozen office bearers of Congress have left the party along with him to join RLD.
