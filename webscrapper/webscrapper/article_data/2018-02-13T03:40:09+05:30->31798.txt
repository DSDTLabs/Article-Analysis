NEW DELHI: The new caps on stent prices are likely to disappoint industry, which was hoping for a roughly 10% hike. Domestic companies feel the 8% margin shared with the distributor and hospital, is too little to cover the inventory carrying cost. 

 Rajiv  , forum coordinator, AiMeD which represents domestic manufacturers, said “Manufacturers would have welcomed higher pricing to accommodate inflation, but I guess that may be forthcoming in the April review. We are happy with NPPA’s new decision to continue with their directive on price cap by not falling to the lobby of overseas multi-national manufacturers. 
 
 Single category for DES is scientific and continuation of this stand gives confidence to manufacturers”. If the formula suggested by AiMed is applied for items between Rs 1,000 and Rs 1 lakh, trade margins between import price/ex-factory price and   would come down to 66%, providing tremendous savings to consumers, Nath added. 
 
 The   (AIDAN) welcomed the price revision but asked for expansion of price cap to consumables to make angiography and angioplasty more affordable. AIDAN also demanded that   write to the   to conduct an investigation on large hospital chains for abusing their dominant position and overcharging for angioplasties after the price cap.
