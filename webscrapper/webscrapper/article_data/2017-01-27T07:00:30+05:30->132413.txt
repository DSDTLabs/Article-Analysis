CHENNAI: A   led to the tripping of four units at   on Wednesday, leading to the loss of 840MW of generation. "At first units 1, 4 and 5 tripped after current transformer burst. Later unit 2 also tripped due to boiler tube puncture. By Thursday morning we were able to re-start unit 5 and by evening except unit 2 all other units were ready to re-start," a senior Tangedco official told TOI.

 The Tuticorin plant has five units with a capacity of 210MW each. Most of these units were commissioned between 1979 and 1991 and since then it has been generating power with mostly imported coal. 
 
 "We have units 1 and 4 on standby as the demand is less and we have re-started units in Mettur and   to supplement the loss from Tuticorin," said the official. 
 
 On Wednesday evening, the peak demand touched 13,222MW. Much of this was met with other Tangedco thermal and central units. "Kudankulam Unit 2 is also generating power to its full capacity and we are getting more than 400MW from this unit. Due to these factors there has been no power shortage," he said. 
 
 The unit 2 in Tuticorin as well as the transformer will take at least two days to repair. "We are hoping to re-start the unit 2 by Sunday and still we will be able to meet the demand even if it crosses 13,500MW without any power cuts," the official said. 
 
 Meanwhile, unit 1 of Kudankulam will restart by the weekend. "We are ready to re-start unit 1 by weekend and by start of next week we will reach full capacity of 1,000MW. The maintenance work on unit 1 has been completed. Unit 2 is also generating 2,000MW continuously and we are yet to go for the last few tests on this unit," said Kudankulam site director RS Sundar.
