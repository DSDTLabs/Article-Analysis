Actress   is furious. A few months ago, stories of her going bankrupt went viral online and even today, people ask her about it. She says, “I don’t know how these stories circulated. Yes, I was going through some difficulty, but that does not mean I had gone bankrupt. I have never asked anyone for money. I am the only child of my parents and it is my responsibility to look after them. My mother was unwell a few months ago, but even then, I did not ask anyone for a loan.”
The actress broke up with her live-in partner (director  ) a few years ago and has been single since then. “We lived together for seven years, but then we realised that we weren’t compatible. I don’t think I want to get married now or look for love. I am happy focusing on my work.” Meanwhile, on the work front,   will soon be seen playing a social worker on Badho Bahu. She says, “It is an interesting role and I am looking forward to being a part of the show.”
