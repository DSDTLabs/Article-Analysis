KOCHI: When UAE-based business developer Hari Krishnan was told of his 12-million-dirham (Rs 20.7 crore) lottery win at   international airport’s big ticket draw, he initially thought the calls informing him about the jackpot were prank calls.

 “I ignored the first couple of calls which informed me about having won a lottery as I thought pranksters were trying to pull a fast one. But later, when some radio stations and media persons started calling me, I asked my wife to check the lottery website, just in case. And she said we had actually won. The state of disbelief we were in then, we are still in it,” Hari said over the phone from Abu Dhabi.
 
 Fortune smiled on Hari on Sunday, his third attempt at the raffle. He is yet to decide how he would like to utilise the prize money, which he will receive on February 5. “I had bought the Dh 500 tickets twice before. There were no real expectations, but with God’s grace I turned out to be lucky,” Hari said.
 
 
 
 
 As of now, I’m thinking that I’ll use the money for my post-retirement expenses and my kid’s education,” said Hari, who has been working as a business developer in the   since 2002.
 
 Hari, who hails from a family with eight siblings in  , will be visiting his hometown on Friday. “I was planning to be in   from January 5 for a week but couldn’t as my leave was not sanctioned. It turned out to be a good thing. Now I can go home to celebrate the joy with my family and friends. As I’m not very active on social media, my friends from different parts of the world had called up my home to get my number and convey their wishes,” Hari said.
 
 Hari and his family will spend two days at Guruvayoor.
