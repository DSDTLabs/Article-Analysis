BENGALURU: After facing a huge backlash, the Karnataka government has replaced the words " " with "all innocent" in its revised circular.

  Earlier, the circular had asked the police officials to drop cases registered against "innocent minorities" involved in the incidents of communal clashes.
 
  However, Karnataka Minister   had yesterday rebuffed the reports and said that it was not a circular, but only a reminder.
 
  "The   doesn't understand English properly. It's not circular, just a reminder. Minority leaders represented that some false cases registered against minorities. IG sent a letter to SPs, gave the reminder that's all", Ramalinga Reddy told ANI.
 
  Reportedly,   issued the circular to withdraw cases against people, who belonged to the   and were allegedly involved in the communal riots in the last five years.
 
  The BJP has cornered the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government for the circular and accused it of resorting to "minority appeasement" ahead of the assembly elections in the state that are due for April or May.
