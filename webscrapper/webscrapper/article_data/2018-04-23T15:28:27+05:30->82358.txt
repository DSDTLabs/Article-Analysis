VADODARA: Income tax (IT) inspector   killed his wife in Harni area of the city on April 11 but the FIR of kidnapping and murder has been registered in Jaipur. The city police helped the   police in investigating the case but, interestingly, no case was registered here. However, if the Rajasthan police agrees, a case of murder may be filed here as well.

 When asked why the city police didn’t register a case despite the crime being committed here, city police commissioner Manoj Sashidhar said, “The Rajasthan police had already filed FIR of dowry against the accused and the incident of murder came to light during their investigations. So, they have filed complaint of murder. CrPC has provisions where the police investigating the case can file complaint irrespective of where the crime has happened.”
 
 Sashidhar, however, said that the city police may investigate the case too. “If the Rajasthan police wants, it can transfer the case to Vadodara. We can investigate the crime,” Sashidhar added.
 
 “We have done videography of the exhumation and after finishing all the standard procedures the body will be taken to Jaipur where the post-mortem will be conducted on Monday,” said Hanuman Prasad, additional DCP (Jaipur East). The body will be handed over to the family members later, he added.
 
 The case was cracked when Choudhary admitted to the crime before the police during his interrogation. Choudhary, an income tax inspector posted in city, had called his wife Munesh to live with him at their bungalow in Trisha Duplex
