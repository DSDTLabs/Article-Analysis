SURAT: A huge national flag on a 100-feet (30 meters) mast will be erected at the Surat airport by April 2017. 

 The   (MHA) has given approval for the erection of 100-feet national flag mast at Surat along with other airports across the country. 
 
 Official sources said that the   (AAI) has started the process of erecting the national flag mast at Surat. The AAI officials posted at Surat has sent a detailed proposal for the same, which is likely to be approved in a day or two.
 
 Though the AAI has been successful in bringing up such a flag that boosts the patriotic spirit of the citizens, however, the location of the flag on the premises of an airport raised many eyebrows, as there are certain height limitations for structures in and around airports.
 
 “The mast is as tall as the four high mast lights on the ‘airside’ of the airport. Installation of the flag mast has all permissions from the authority and it does not affect movement of aircraft or the functioning of the airport, as it does not come in the line of runway,” Airport Director   said. 
 
 The air traffic control (ATC) tower close to the runway and current terminal is a 4-storied structure and only about 50 feet high, he added.
 
 Sources said that the proposal for the national flag mast was sent for approval much earlier by the AAI to the MHA. However, the approval has been given few days ago, along with other airports across the country.
 
 “We will have to maintain spare flags for replacement if any problem occurs to the existing one. It will be a permanent feature at the airport and will be flying even in the night,” said an airport officer.
 
 The flag’s fabric would be in the range of 30 feet long and 20 feet wide. As per the norms of  , the permissible height of structures in the location of the flag is about 43 metres. The flag is installed in front of the terminal which is at a distance of at least half kilometre from the nearest point of runway.
