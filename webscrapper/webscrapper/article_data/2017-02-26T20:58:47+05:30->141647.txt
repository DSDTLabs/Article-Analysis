The two ladies, who have been rumoured to be on sour terms with each other, hugged it out as they posed together for pictures at the farewell dinner on the sets of the hit television series ' '. 

 Nina and Ian, who played lovers on the Vampire series, went on to date each other off-screen as well for years before calling off the romance in 2013. Ian went on to date Nikki Reed (believed to be good friends with Nina) and they eventually tied the knot in May 2015. This surprise wedding announcement was followed by Nina's shocking exit from the hit show after 6 seasons. This move gave rise to many speculations of alleged 'backstabbing', 'feuds' and 'jealousy' brewing between the reel couple (Ian and Nina) and real couple (Ian and Nikki).

Farewell dinner with team Somereed! So good catching up with these goofballs. All love', Reed took things a step further, penning a long caption that should shut down those 'made-up stories' once and for all.
