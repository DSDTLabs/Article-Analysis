Indore: Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan inaugurated the much-awaited fire station at Sanwer road on Monday. The new fire station at sector F is expected to minimize fire incidents in industrial area and cut response time limiting losses.

 Mahajan stressed upon the need of a hydraulic fire tender in Indore for quick and effective fire response.
 
 Audyogik Kendra Vikas Nigam (AKVN) has constructed fire station in the sector F of Sanwer road industrial area on 20,000 sq ft. The cost of building is around 90 lakh. The maintenance, logistics and operations of the fire station will be handled jointly by the Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) and fire department.
 
 Fire superintendent SP Anjana Tiwari said, “We are hopeful of cutting down the response time by Sanwer road fire station to about 5 to 10 min against 15 to 30 min earlier when fire tenders had to rush from Laxmibai Nagar.”
 
 “Fire incidents rises in fire season which commences from March 15 and with the inaugural of the station, we expect less industrial fire cases from this year.”
 
 The fire station is equipped with 2 fire tenders, 1 bullet vehicle and 1 water tanker of 25,000 litre capacity. The station will have 23 staff members.
