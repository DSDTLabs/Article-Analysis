When popular television producer   set out to make her first film, she was clear about one thing — the movie had to make people sit up and take notice of it. She achieved her goal with ' ', a thought-provoking film which bagged innumerable awards, and has been honoured with the National Award now. Excerpts from a conversation with an elated Rashmi... 

 
 
 We were ecstatic, it’s a dream come true. The best part is the category in which we have won the award; this film was an effort to bring forward the issues faced by women in today’s world.
 
 
 
 CHANGE is inevitable. This film was an effort from our side to bring about a wave towards reforming society. The subject was so strong that the first time we heard it, we knew this was what we wanted to be associated with. I am overwhelmed with the kind of response to the movie.
 
 
 
 There is a dialogue in the movie which says ‘No Means No’ which got a lot of accolades. In our patriarchal society, men ignore or pretend to ignore a woman’s ‘No’. They take it as ‘Yes’, but this thinking needs to change. Our movie, to a certain extent, has been able to bring about this change.
 
 
 We got a lot of feedback from women, a lot of them came up and shared their thoughts with us. This film encouraged women to stand up for what is right. Men talk about how women should be treated equally and not be objectified, but in reality they are mere words. I personally feel this changed after 'Pink'.
 
 
 
 We want to make a film which will surpass the love and respect 'Pink' has got us. We are in the process of finalising scripts and you will hear about it soon.
