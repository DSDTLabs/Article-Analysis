Bhopal: Rising temperature and deepening   began to impact construction of about 5,000 houses, being carried out under PM Awas Yojana in Guna, a district bordering Rajasthan. Zilla panchayat CEO says he will ensure no person remains thirsty and will have to acquire private water sources to see the houses get constructed before the onset of monsoon.

 Already, the villages bordering the desert state are feeling the heat.Villages of Bamori and Chachoda blocks, adjoining Rajasthan, are facing acute water crisis. In some villages, people have to fetch water from a distance of 2 to 4 km. Water bodies are drying up and the water table has gone down impacting tube-wells as well, said Nandram, a villager in Cachoda.
 
 “Guna is ahead of all districts in the country in the construction of the houses under PM Awas Yojana,” said CEO of district Panchayat Kailash Wankhede. More water is required to construct a house and 5,000 houses, at varying stages, of construction need water, he said. 
 
 “We want to complete construction before the monsoon. At the same time, we will see to it that people get adequate water to quench their thirst as well. Rs 2 lakh have been issued to panchayats in areas facing water crisis to repair and maintain water sources for optimum use of water. Besides, we will also make lakes to ensure more water in coming monsoon,” Wankhede said.
 
 As many as 7,500 houses are being constructed in Bamori while 4,500 houses are under construction in Chachoda block, he said. Of them 5,000 houses are located in villages facing acute water crisis.
 
 District collector Rajesh Jain says he is monitoring the situation on a day-to-day basis and will ensure water crisis does not affect life of people and construction of the houses.
