NOIDA: A 30-year-old man was booked on Saturday after he allegedly went to a house   with two revolvers and threatened to shoot the occupants as they had objected to him sexually harassing their minor daughter, in Noida Extension. 

 The girl’s brother said that on Friday evening, his 14-year-old sister visited the local grocery shop to buy a cold drink. “My sister was returning home when the accused,   and his 3-4 friends, stopped her and passed derogatory remarks. She asked them to mind their language and returned home,” he said.
 
 The girl then informed her family members, who believed the matter had been resolved and did not approach police. However, the accused reached the girl’s home with two revolvers the following morning, said her brother.
 
 “He knocked on the door. We opened it and found him armed with guns in both hands. He seemed to be inebriated and was stammering and pointing the guns at us. He threatened to shoot me,” he said.
 
 One of the family members captured the ruckus on his mobile phone. In the footage, the accused is seen repeatedly threatening the family. The girl’s family locked themselves inside the house. They claimed the accused had been harassing the girl for some months.
 
 Akhilesh  , SHO of   police station, said a case under sections 307, 452, 354, 504 and 506 has been registered against the accused who is missing.
