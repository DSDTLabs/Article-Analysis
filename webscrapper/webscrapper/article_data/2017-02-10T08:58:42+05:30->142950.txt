BHOPAL: Over 3 lakh school students in Bhopal on Thursday chewed the deworming pill in a mass deworming exercise to flush out parasitic worms that could cause acute anaemia and malnourishment among children.

 Students were given the chewable tablet, Albendazole 400 mg, by trained employees. Trained teachers and anganwadi workers were deployed on duty for smooth conduct of the event. The inaugural programme was organised at Raja Bhoj Higher Secondary School, Bhopal. “The children in the age group from 1 to 18 years were de-wormed through government-aided schools, tribal ashram schools and anganwadi centres. As many as 3 lakh school students were given the pill,” said   (DEO) DK Sharma.
 
 The DEO said students who were absent and could not get the tablet will be dewormed on February 15 in the next phase of campaign. CMHO Dr   said minor side-effects like nausea, headache, vomiting, dysentery and tiredness may be experienced, but it is temporary. “Deworming is necessary twice a year. If not done, it can lead to lack of nutrition and anaemia,” she said, adding that if symptoms don't subside in 24 hours, the child must be given immediate medical attention. Albendazole suspension/pill, ORS packet, domperidon tablet, dicyclomin tablet and suspension, paracetamol tablet and suspension and CPM tablet/cetrizin tablets were made available in all schools and anganwadis across the city.
 
 Children in the age group 1-2 years were given the tablets diluted in water in the morning hours. However, the drive did not cover private schools due to unavailability of trained staff. The campaign was organised by public health and family welfare department in association with departments of school education, integrated child development and tribal welfare throughout the state. Besides, 1,47,666 children of primary, middle, higher secondary and private schools, 166 central schools and 63,832 anganwadi centres chewed the tablets across state on Thursday.
