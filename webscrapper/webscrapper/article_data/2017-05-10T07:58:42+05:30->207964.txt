CHARMINAR: A jittery minorities welfare department (MWD) is racing against time to install   cameras at the  , ahead of Ramzan. 

 The deadline is ticking as   converge at the masjid everyday. Sources said that while as much as 1 crore has been given to the Departsment of Archaeology and Museums for conservation work, the installing of cameras continues to be the prerogative of the minorities welfare department. To speed up the process, sources said the department is unlikely to go through the conventional process of calling for tenders. Instead, the department has written to city police commissioner, M Mahender Reddy, seeking clear specifications so that they can be installed. 
 
 "A reply has come from the city police commissioner. The   has empanelled three CCTV camera vendors. It is likely that we will procure it from them. It comes with a two-year maintenance contract. A file has been circulated and it will be with the chief minister  ," said minorties welfare department secretary Syed Omer Jaleel.
