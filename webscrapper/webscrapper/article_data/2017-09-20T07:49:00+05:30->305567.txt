Faridkot: Baba Farid Agman Purb –– a national-level heritage, religious and sports festival –– started with fanfare on Tuesday at the princely town of Faridkot. Besides town residents, thousands of people from far-off places attend the five-day festival.

 Faridkot deputy commissioner Rajiv Parashar, who is the chairman of Agman Purb committee, inaugurated the heritage festival. Faridkot MP Sadhu Singh of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and Faridkot MLA Kushaldeep Singh Dhillon of the Congress were also present.
 
 The fest started with a Kafila-e-Virasat (heritage caravan) depicting the heritage of the town and of Punjab. Decorated camels and horses and girls in traditional Punjabi dresses with plaques against social evils were the centre of attraction in the walk.
 
 “A national-level seminar on the life of Baba Farid and a host of cultural, sports and Sufi presentations will be held during the fest as the artists from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal and Rajasthan will showcase their talents during the festival,” said DC Parashar.
 
 Baba Farid Sewa Society led by chairperson and philanthropist Inderjit Singh Sekhon had started observing Baba Farid Agman Purb 48 years ago in 1969 to preserve the memory of the Sufi saint. The festival started attracting hundreds of visitors in the following years and going by its popularity, the North Zone Cultural Centre (NZCC) had started supporting the Purb in 1986.
 
 “In 2009, it was accorded the status of heritage festival and the Punjab government became a partner in organising the event. Baba Farid’s bani (writings) was researched by the founder of Sikhism Guru Nanak Dev and pursued by Guru Angad Dev, Guru Amar Dass, Guru Ram Dass and finally were recorded in Adi Granth in 1604 by Guru Arjan Dev,” said Maheepinder Sekhon, a member of Baba Farid Sewa Society.
