Panaji: The first   of the New Year will be launched on January 6 with Prasad Creations’ film titled ‘Martin’. The 90-minute suspense thriller is yet another making of A Durga Prasad of ‘Enemy’ fame.

 “This film is not based on a socio-political issue like most others tend to be. This is a light-hearted Konkani movie that offers a lot of entertainment,” said director  .
 
 He further informed that the narrative has a human interest angle to it that reveals the workings of karma on one’s actions.
 
 The plot revolves around the titular character, Martin, who returns to Goa after eight years, and the events that follow. 
 
 A total of 25 characters take the story forward to meet its resolution.
 
 With a budget of Rs 50 lakh, the film was shot in 10 days in South Goa. Martin features two songs sung by Sia Ghodge and Elvis Mascarenhas. The film will also mark the comeback of actor  , who was last seen in Rajendra Talak’s 2004 release ‘Alisha’.
 
 Sharing his thoughts on the surge of Konkani films, cinematographer Sharmad Pai Raiturkar said, “We are slowly growing from 2-3 films a year to over 10-15 films. There is immense potential for filmmakers in Goa, thus there is a need to expand this industry in the state.”
