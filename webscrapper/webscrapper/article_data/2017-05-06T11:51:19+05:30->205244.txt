 PATIALA: The Patiala municipal corporation is set to declare five new wards in areas which boast a large number of   The wards will be created within the   of the corporation. 
 
 A running survey to find out the new number of votersis underway in Patiala, with around 200 surveyors on a month-long mission to survey every ward till the end of May.
 
 "We will include five new wards and the number will increase to 55," said PMC commissioner  . 
 
  The corporation currently has 50 wards, five councillors of which are from the Congress, and the rest from the   (SAD). Out of these 50, 28 wards fall in the Patiala urban area while the rest are in the rural constituency segment. 
 
 Interestingly, the corporation dropped a plan to add new areas to the limits of the corporation. Officials had suggested including areas like Bhadso road and urban estate, which would have their development especially with regard to laying of sewerage and water pipelines there. Currently, these areas fall under panchayats.
 
 "The PMC should incude our area in its limits," said  , a resident of urban estate. "There is no sewerage laid here, and during rains, the water remains on the streets. Similarly, there are no pipelines laid for the supply of water."
 
 But these residents have no luck for now. "Somehow, the plan got dropped," Chahal said.
