LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party president   on Saturday said his bonhomie with independent MLA   alias Raja Bhaiya is over. “Lagta to nahi hai ki humare saath hain”(It doesn’t seem that he is with us), Akhilesh said, responding to a media query.

 
 A known bitter rival of BSP supremo Mayawati, Raja Bhaiya had made headlines days before recent   polls when he announced support for SP. Akhilesh also tweeted his photo with Raja Bhaiya, and thanked him for his support.
 
 
 Raja Bhaiya’s role came under cloud when spare SP votes could not secure a victory for BSP candidate and Mayawati blamed Raja Bhaiya. Minutes after Mayawati’s statement, Akhilesh deleted his tweet thanking Raja Bhaiya.
 
 
 Responding to a media query, Akhilesh said, “If my information is correct, Raja Bhaiya did not support us, then there was nothing wrong in deleting the tweet.” Asked whether Raja Bhaiya voted for SP, Akhilesh said “Lagta to nahi hai”(It doesn’t seem so). Akhilesh went on to add that those who claim to be with SP should abide by party decision or else stay away.
 
 
 Defending senior SP leader Azam Khan, against whom a probe has been ordered, Akhilesh said the government is out to defame opposition leaders. “They are only trying to defame and harass   because he had given jobs to unemployed and ruling BJP does not like that,” said a combative Akhilesh while adding: “BJP will reap what it is sowing.”
