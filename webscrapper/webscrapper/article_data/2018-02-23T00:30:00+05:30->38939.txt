Trichy: The Trichy Corporation on Thursday launched an novel initiative to beautify the city roads by placing flowering plants along the arterial medians. In the first phase, as many as 230 pots with flowering plants were placed on the median of the arterial Anna Nagar link road. The pots bearing the Trichy Corporation’s Swachh logo were placed at a distance of three metres each on the median connecting MGR roundabout with Thennur. When the flowering plants grow, they will serve an additional purpose -- they will block the high beams from the headlights of vehicles which could pose danger to drivers coming from the opposite direction. According to corporation officials, the beautification initiative covering wide roads and walking tracks will induce pleasant feel among the commuters and morning walkers. The corporation procured 1,000 flowering plants with pots at an estimated cost of Rs 5 lakh. “We have procured the flowering plants, including vedchi (Ixora coccinea) from Hosur, and compost prepared from our micro compost yards will be used to enrich the plant’s growth. Our sanitary workers, while involved in morning cleaning activities, will ensure that the plants are watered properly,” a senior corporation official said. The drive would be covering mostly the four lane roads in the city such as Anna Nagar link road and Bharathidasan Salai, corporation sources said.  Though the move is touted to beautify the roads and give a pleasant feel for road users, stray cattle menace would be a challenging task for the civic body to maintain the flower pots, residents said. Corporation sources also said that more medians in arterial stretches would be beautified with the plants and added that fencing would be done to covering the pots to prevent stray cattle from damaging them.
