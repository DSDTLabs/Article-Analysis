KOZHIKODE: Kerala   (M) chairman and former finance minister K M   has said that the statements made by CPI state secretary   opposing the entry of KC(M) into the LDF fold was borne out of his and his party’s inferiority complex.

 Speaking at the district leadership meeting of the KC(M) at the   here on Saturday, Mani said that KC(M) has not submitted application for entry to any front.
 
 “KC(M) is a party with self-respect and we are currently following an independent political stand. We won’t stand in a queue before any front, seeking entry. Then why should Kanam and CPI make such irresponsible statements. I think it reflects the inferiority complex of the party and its leader,” Mani said.
 
 Stating that the party had won many elections in the past on its own, Mani said that the KC(M) will have electoral cooperation with parties which are aligned with the policies of the party with regard to agriculture and development.
 
 Taking a dig at Kanam, Mani said that the CPI leader should end his ‘Kanana vasam’ and come to the real world to understand more about KC(M).
 
 Mani however said that he was putting an end to the war of words with the CPI leader over the issue and will not respond to Kanam’s statements henceforth.
 
 Later Mani held talks with   state president Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal and MPs P K Kunhalikutty and E T   at the League House. Mani also participated in the E Ahamed remembrance meeting.
 
 Mani had on Friday addressed a seminar organized as part of the CPM’s ongoing state conference in Thrissur.
