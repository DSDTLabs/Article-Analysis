THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state assembly on Friday, passed a unanimous resolution urging the central government to initiate effective steps to protect the interests of Malayalis working abroad, especially in   countries, "where they are on the verge of losing  ". 

 Immediate measures should be taken to rehabilitate the Malayalis losing jobs due to localisation policies in Gulf countries, especially  . The measures should include help to find new jobs in their current resident countries with the support of chambers of commerce and embassies, the resolution said.
 
 Though presented by CPM MLA K V   as a private members' resolution, the assembly, after discussions, decided to pass it as an official resolution with some amendments, considering the merit of the issue. "The central government is not giving due consideration to the problems faced by the expatriate population, whose remittance contribute to more than a third of  's GDP. These expatriates should be given encouragement, concessions and benefits similar to those given to exporters and foreign investors," the resolution said.
 
 It also pointed out that 86.3% of the 31 lakh Malayalis working abroad were in Gulf countries (out of which 37.5% are in the UAE and 22% in Saudi Arabia). The Saudization in commercial establishments will affect a huge population of Keralites working as salesmen there (11% of Malayali expatriates), the resolution said.
 
 Earlier, presenting the resolution, Abdul Khader said the central government should contribute to the welfare fund and various schemes meant for NRKs, which are now running with contributions from the state and beneficiaries.
