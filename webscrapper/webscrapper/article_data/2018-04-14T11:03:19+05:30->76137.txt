PATIALA: The local city police on Friday rounded up some protesting residents who demanded basic amenities including sewerage in Mohindra Colony. The police made them sit in the police station at the behest of the local   councillor,  , and then let them go after they 'agreed' for a compromise. 

 The residents in Ward no. 40 represented by Malhotra on Friday, staged a protest against the city mayor and the local councillor besides raising slogans against Punjab chief minister   and his wife and former union minister Preneet Kaur. 
 
 One of the protesting residents said, "We had high hopes in the CM who represents the city. But all the promises have turned out to be false. We met the local councillor who even threatened us." Four protesters Pardeep Singh, Gurmeet Singh and two others were detained. Malhotra said, "I have got approval for funds for my ward including Rs 9 lakh for sewerage, Rs 10 lakh for construction of Haridass Dharamshala." 
 
 Police station Division No. 2, Station House Officer (SHO) Surinder Bhalla said, "They were brought here and a compromise was made between them and the councillor. We haven't misbehaved with anyone."
