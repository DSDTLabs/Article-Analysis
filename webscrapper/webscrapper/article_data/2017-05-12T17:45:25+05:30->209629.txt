NEW DELHI: In a huge setback for Congress president   and her son Rahul, the Delhi High Court has cleared an 
  , Times Now reported.

 The case is based on a private criminal complaint filed by BJP MP   in 2012. He has accused the Gandhis and others of conspiring to cheat and misappropriate funds by paying just Rs 50 lakh to acquire a company worth more than Rs 2,000 crore. In addition to the Gandhis, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey and Sam Pitroda are the other accused in this case.
 
  
  
 Swamy said that an entity called Young Indian Private Limited (YIL) - in which Sonia and Rahul both have shareholdings - paid Rs 50 lakh to acquire The   (AJL) which published the   newspaper. What the BJP MP alleged as being dodgy was the fact that AJL owed as much as Rs 90.25 crore to the   and that YIL "took over" in a questionable manner AJL that is worth more than Rs 2,000 crore.
 
 The Gandhis, who are accused in the case along with some other Congress leaders, contended that 
  was "in the nature of a fishing and roving enquiry which is not permissible in law".
