KOLKATA: The   may move court against some Madurai traders, including a  , over allegedly   at a Kidderpore ATM around 2am on November 9, hours after demonetisation was declared.

 The police are especially looking to question the shipping magnate to learn why a major chunk of money, which was transferred from the ATM, belonged to him. “The industrialist seems to be the ring leader. He disregarded our notice for the second time on Thursday and now, we may arrest him,” said an officer. The other Madurai traders questioned have refused to clarify why people in Kolkata would use their (traders’) debit cards to transfer money to defunct KYC-compliant accounts in Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.
 
 The income-tax department found out about the ostensibly illegal transfers during a series of raids in Tamil Nadu in November-end. “A pan-India chain of middlemen, with links in Kolkata, are involved,” claimed an officer.
 
 Following the Tamil Nadu raids, the Watgunge police joined the “Kolkata dots” during the probe into the arrest of two youths whom a patrol team found in a Kidderpore ATM, its shutters pulled halfway down. The Port division police said on entering the ATM, the cops found the youths —identified as Samirddin Sk and Arshad Ali from Bihar—transferring money with 18 cards from a government bank, none belonging to them. They transferred around Rs 2 lakh to accounts of Madurai, Bihar, Odisha and Andhra residents. The cops have found that the youths were paid Rs 2,500 for each transaction.
