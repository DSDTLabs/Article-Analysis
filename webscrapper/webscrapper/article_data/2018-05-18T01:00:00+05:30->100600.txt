' ' is a film that’s about the cool camaraderie and bonding between four gal pals —  , Kareena Kapoor Khan,   and  . This picture featuring the four actresses is from a point in the film when the girls go on a trip, enjoying on the beaches of Phuket, Thailand. For this particular shot, the actresses got clicked in their own swimsuits. 

 It was just supposed to be a candid photo shoot, but they were having such a blast on the beach and it looked so real that director Shashanka Ghosh, included it in the song Veere from the film. The girls were totally living it up in Thailand and for the duration of this shoot they even stayed in the same villa. 
 
 In the film, Kareena’s character contemplates the decision of calling off her wedding. Her way of dealing with the unsure feeling is to go on a vacation with her friends. Her buddies Sonam, Swara and Shikha step in to pep her up. In that sense, the besties are out on a honeymoon of sorts with each other, minus the men of course.
