Panaji: Goa has been asked to submit details of the remedial teaching provided to students of Class IX under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) during the annual review of the scheme.  Officials of the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry expressed concern at the high drop out rate in Class IX in Goa. Minutes of the meeting held earlier this year show that Goa officials tried to explain the high drop out in Class IX stating that the 4,349 students who are repeaters from the previous academic year should not be taken into account while calculating the drop out rate. According to them, this brings down the drop out rate in the class from 32% to 17%. But, HRD officials said, “The enrolment in Class IX was 24,157 and in Class X was 19,837. From these two figures, the drop out turns out to be 17.88%, which is still high.” The no-fail policy, which was introduced in Goa in 2010, prohibits schools from detaining students up to Class VIII. But, there is nothing to prevent schools from detaining students from Class IX onwards. In their hunger for a place in the roll of honour as a school with cent percent pass out rate, schools often appear to keep students back in Class IX. The state board has long acknowledged the practice of detaining students in Class IX for better Class X results. The board's data in 2013 had shown that city schools are likely to make a bigger chunk of upto 50% of its Class IX students to repeat the class. While the officials feel that the trend has always existed, it is not clear if there has been a rise in detentions in Class IX due to the no-detention policy.
