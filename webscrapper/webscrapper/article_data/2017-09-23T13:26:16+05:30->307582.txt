CHANDIGARH: Agitated over the recent circular sent by the  , Sector 38, Chandigarh, asking parents to accompany children in school buses, the Chandigarh Parents Association on Friday filed a complaint with education secretary B L Sharma.

 In the complaint, the association alleged that by asking parents to accompany the children in the school buses, the school is coercing parents to be  .
 
 The complaint reads, “Education Department had recently issued guidelines for ensuring the security of school students, however, it seems that some schools got the wrong end of the stick. It has been further specified that if a parent is not able to do his or her bus duty on a particular day, he will have to exchange it with the other parent and inform the school two days in advance.”
 
 Notably, the school recently issued a circular to the school asking one of the parents will have to accompany his ward in the school buses both during the morning and return trip, on a rotational basis from October 3.
 
 “The Circular reads that only the father or the mother of the child would be permitted and no guardian or household help would be allowed to fill in. We find this insane and atrocious, to say the least. If this circular is allowed to sustain, in future they may like to outsource other duties to the parents like guarding the washrooms on a roaster basis,” said association president, Nitin Goyal.
 
 He said that instead of involving the parents in the decision-making process to deciding on the school’s budgets and fee structure, they are forcing parents to work free as bus attendants.
