TIRUPATI: Even as scientists are debating the   at the main venue of the  , a small group is engrossed in understanding the origins of man and life on the earth.

 “Life begets life,” argues researcher   of   in Kolkata, negating the theories of evolution. “If you want to understand the creation of man and the creator, you should first know the basics like spiriton and big vision,” he said.
 
 Spiriton is just like an electron, he said, adding that one cannot see either. As electrons are an essential part of matter, spiritons are building blocks of life. This group does not believe the big bang theory, but propounds the big vision theory. “What we need is the big vision to understand life, its origin and the one who makes life. Unfortunately, most of us lack the big vision to fathom the depths of life and move closer to the creator,” said researcher PS Murthy.
 
 “Research is going on in our institute. We have come out with publications but the vision is so big that we are yet to understand it,” said Das.
