BENGALURU: The Karnataka Milk Federation’s (KMF) attempt to boost revenue by seeking tax exemption for milkshake has been spiked by the  . The department has categorically told KMF, which markets milk products under the brand name Nandini, that milkshake is not milk. 

 The debate on whether milkshake can be classified as milk went on for over six months in bureaucratic circles, before the commercial taxes department came out with the verdict which was notified by the Karnataka government on February 9. 
 
 It all started when KMF approached the department stating that milkshake falls under serial number 24 of the first schedule (which mentions the products eligible for tax exemption) of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act-2003 (KVAT Act-2003). Serial no. 24 pertains to milk and pasteurized milk.
 
 Citing a   judgment in a similar case, the KMF had stated that milkshake prepared by sterilization of toned milk at high temperature by adding sugar, colour and flavour is capable of being classified under serial no. 24 of the first schedule of KVAT Act –– 2003. 
 
 However, the commercial tax department chose to apply Wikipedia’s definition of milkshake as a “sweet, cold beverage which is usually made from milk, ice cream or iced milk and flavours or sweeteners such as butterscotch, caramel sauce, chocolate sauce or fruit syrup”, and ruled: “Milkshake is not fresh milk or pasteurized milk per se, but is a different commodity made from milk. Hence, it cannot be classified as milk.” The department ordered that milkshake manufactured and marketed by KMF is liable to tax at 14.5% as per the KVAT Act-2003.
 
 The department also stated that if KMF were to sell pasteurized milk without any additives such as sugar, colour and flavour it could have been eligible for tax exemption. The other option was to coax the government to include milkshake in the list of products that have been extended tax exemption.
 
 Sources in KMF maintained that they would appeal to   to exempt  .
