CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh administration is yet to approve the the revised drawing of the  , which   has sent to them. The aim was to increase the sitting area in the vending zones. 

 But, with the approval still hanging fire, the shifting process of the vendors from current places to the earmarked vending zone will be delayed more.
 
 Earlier, the earmarked area for the registered street vendors of the city to sit and do their business was 5 feet by 3 feet. The space was too narrow and short. Hence, MC was told to revise the plan. The vendors as well as political parties also asked the authorities to consider the same.
 
 After that, the civic body sent the revised proposal to the Chandigarh administration revising the earlier size of each sitting plan from 5 feet by 3 feet to 6 feet by 5 feet.
 
 Significantly, the move had come at a time, when the engineering wing of the MC had already demarcated the area in most parts of the city. Significantly, the engineering department of the MC has already spent around Rs 1 crore to construct the temporary sites for the vendors in different areas of the city.
 
 City mayor   has recently held the meeting with the senior officers of the urban planning department of the Chandigarh administration along with all the municipal councillors to resolve their issues regarding the subject. The issue of settling the vendors of Sector 17 and earmarking of space for the vendors in Sector 22 were also discussed there.
