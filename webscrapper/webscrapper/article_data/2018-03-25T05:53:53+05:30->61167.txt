CHANDIGARH: A development   of Rs 200 every month on all   of  , a substantial jump in allocation across most sectors and a roughly 30% increase in revenue receipts were the highlights of state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s second budget, which was presented on Saturday. Even allocation for farm debt waiver was more than doubled from Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 4,250 crore. The overall size of the budget has been pegged at Rs 1,02,198 crore.

 
 The finance minister insisted that the state was taking baby steps towards fiscal consolidation, but problems still hounded Punjab with rising debt and growing expenditure. Elaborating on the financial health of the state, he said, “Debt servicing (principal and interest) for 2018-19 is a whopping Rs 24,870 crore. The only way left for this government is to mobilise more revenue, while cutting down on noncommitted expenditure.”
 
 
 He proposed raising Rs 1,500 crore through additional resource mobilisation, including the new tax. But this still leaves an unfunded resource gap of Rs 4,175 crore. “I hope that with improved tax compliance and efficient delivery of public services, expenditure will be economised,” he said.
 
 The total budget size has been kept at Rs 1.29 lakh crore, though the effective size is Rs 1.02 lakh crore.
