MARGAO: Persistent power problems were the topic of discussion at   gram sabha on Sunday.

 Telaulim sarpanch   said, “The villagers sought that the panchayat requests the electricity department to replace the old, worn-out conductors and take necessary measures regarding low-lying wires. Another issue discussed was that of increasing the height of the bridge proposed by chief minister   for the western bypass in order to let emergency service vehicles pass through.”
 
 Only four panchas of the seven-member panchayat were in attendance at the meeting.
