PATNA: Chief minister   on Wednesday evening ordered   conducted by the   (BSSC) following the arrest of commission secretary Parmeshwar Ram and data operator Avinash Kumar earlier in the day in connection with an alleged question leak scam.

 The arrests were made by the Patna Police’s special investigation team (SIT) which had recommended scrapping of the examinations after its probe detected large-scale irregularities in the BSSC functioning.
 
 At least 18.5 lakh candidates applied three years back to the BSSC for its four-phase examinations to fill up 13,120 Intermediate-level clerical vacancies in various departments of the state government. Almost half of the applicants wrote the tests on January 29 and February 5 while the remaining aspirants were to appear at the examinations to be held on February 12 and 19. 
 
 “Call detail records of Avinash as well as Pawan Kumar, Vineet Kumar and Navneet Kumar, arrested from Patna on February 4 for allegedly running a job racket, confirm they were in constant touch with one another,” Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj told newsmen, adding the answers of February 5 examination was available to select candidates on January 29. 
 
 “This means the questions were leaked even before they reached treasuries in the districts where examination centres were located,” the SSP said.
 
 Police are learned to have found several roll numbers and other details of many candidates in commission secretary Parmeshwar’s cellphone. “Two admit cards and other incriminating documents were also recovered from Parmeshwar’s Bhagwant Nagar residence on Bhootnath Road in Patna,” Maharaaj said.
 
 Patna ASP (operations) Rakesh Dubey said Avinash has confessed his involvement in the scam. He has told interrogators he used to act on the directions of Parmeshwar.
 
 The scam came to light when a hand-written page with 135 answers surfaced in public domain several hours before the February 5 examination.
