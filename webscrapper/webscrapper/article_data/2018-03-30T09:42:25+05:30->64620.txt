CHENNAI: Makkal Needhi Maiam president, and actor   on Thursday said the BJP government at the Centre was delaying constitution of the   because of the impending assembly election in Karnataka where the BJP is trying to wrest power from the Congress. The   government should mount pressure on the Union government to get this done, he added.

 “The Centre can establish   Management Board, if it is keen to do so. But, I too believe like several others that the Centre is delaying it due to the impending elections in Karnataka,” Haasan told reporters on Thursday. “I have sought time with the chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami to discuss the way forward on Cauvery,” he said.
 
 The Prime Minister can do it, if he wants to do it. “Sir, you can do it, if you have the will to do it. Please do it,” he appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “From requesting Cauvery water in TMCs, we have not come to this. We have been going down in getting our rightful share in water as well as getting our rights fulfilled. This is not good for the state and the country,” he said.
 
 “Suicide is something am opposed to, even if it is committed by someone who is heartbroken. The politicians are using it as a joke. However, I will appreciate and praise them if they go ahead and resign as MPs, as promised earlier,” Kamal said, reacting to an AIADMK MP’s assertion to commit suicide.
 
 Reacting to the ongoing public protests against the functioning of Sterlite Copper smelter in Tuticorin, Kamal Haasan said, he will be joining the public in their protests against the plant on April 1. 
 
 “We cannot allow another Bhopal like tragedy to happen in Tuticorin,” he said.
