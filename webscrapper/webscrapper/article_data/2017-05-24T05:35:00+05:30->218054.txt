MUMBAI: Animal activists have welcomed the state government’s decision to rehabilitate or compensate Victoria owners and drivers so that the horses do not have to run on concrete roads. 

 On Monday, the   banned horse carriages in Mumbai and decided to rehabilitate all 91 Victoria owners and 130 drivers by issuing them hawking licences besides compensation of Rs 1 lakh. Those who don’t want the licence will get Rs 3 lakh relief. 
 
 The state decision comes nearly two years after the Bombay high court ruled that using   in Mumbai for ‘joyrides’ is illegal. The high court had heard arguments from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India, an intervener in the case, along with   (PFA) and the main petitioner, Animals and  , that included expert veterinary testimony that forcing horses to ply on concrete was making them lame. 
 
 Dr  , PETA India’s director of veterinary affairs, said, “We are pleased that we are closer to seeing the horse-drawn Victorias relegated to the pages of history books. We commend the Maharashtra government for this positive step.” 
 
 However, horse handlers and owners are sceptical of the decision as their business will be hit. Mohommad Allarka Goyal, a Victoria owner, said, “They took away our horses saying we harm them, but they themselves are not providing the horses basic necessities. We have been left jobless without any compensation.”
 
 MP  , who supported the ban on horse carriages, said, “We thank the Maharashtra government for this positive step. Now no horse will be exploited on the streets of Mumbai and the owners will get alternative employment which will be more stable. A horse can fall sick anytime, but a hawker’s licence will guarantee them steady income and livelihood.”
