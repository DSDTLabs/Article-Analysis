Ramanathapuram: As wind speed exceeded the prescribed limit, train traffic on the Pamban railway bridge connecting   island with the mainland came to a standstill after 3pm on Wednesday. The winds continue to blow heavily disrupting traffic and train services will be resumed only after the wind speed reduces, according to railway officials. 

 In order to ensure train safety, anemometers are fixed on the bridge and they turn the signals red automatically once the wind speed exceeds 58km per hour. Once the wind speed exceeded 60 kmph on Wednesday afternoon, the signals turned red on both sides of the bridge. 
 
 As a result, train no. 56721 Madurai – Rameswaram passenger about to cross the bridge was halted after Mandapam. Since the winds remained heavy till evening, the train could not cross the bridge and passengers after waiting for more than two hours got down from it and took the road to reach Rameswaram.
 
 Subsequently, most of the trains which were to cross the bridge were stranded. The Rameswaram – Madurai passenger leaving at 6pm is yet to start from the station. Similarly, express trains like Boat Mail starting from Rameswaram at 5pm, Rameswaram – Coimbatore Express at 7pm have been affected. Inbound trains to Rameswaram are also affected. Railway sources in Madurai division said that train services could resume only when the wind velocity comes within permissible limit. Till then trains will be delayed, they said.
