Nagpur: Citizens have demanded that all new roads should be over nine metre wide keeping in view the future requirements of the city.

 The demand was raised during the meeting of city-level advisory forum of Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Limited (NSSCDCL).
 
 Tejinder Singh Renu, member of the forum, said that effective width of the roads shrunk soon after their construction as people parked vehicles on both sides. “We should plan for 30 to 40 years ahead. We can’t do redevelopment every 10 to 15 years,” he told TOI. Renu further said that NSSCDCL planned to install 65 automated public information kiosks. “The number is very high. It should be drastically brought down as Nagpurians are not trained enough to use them. Moreover, most such machines have become non-functional after a few months and they were not repaired,” he added.
 
 The members also opposed free Wi-Fi for initial 30 minutes. “This has actually reduced efficiency rather than increasing it. It is more used for unproductive data,” said Renu.
 
 Smart City consultants have suggested that LED display boards be installed at squares to educate road users about traffic rules. Members said that it was a bad idea as violators would hardly be affected by the messages.
 
 Renu also stressed that beautification should only be done if NSSCDCL was planning to maintain it. “We have many examples of taxpayers’ money being wasted on a large scale and the beautified spot turn ugly within some years due to lack of maintenance,” he added.
