HYDERABAD: More than 1,000kg of ganja hidden under a load of cabbage was seized from a truck headed towards Hyderabad from Vijayawada.

 Sleuths from the   (DRI), Hyderabad, arrested the truck driver in Vijayawada on Saturday night. They impounded 1,334kg of ganja, one of the biggest seizures in recent months.
 
 This is the second major seizure of ganja in 15 days. In the last week of December, 800kg of ganja was seized at Shamshabad. “We got a tip about a consignment of ganja headed to Hyderabad. The truck was intercepted in Vijayawada, and the driver, T  , a resident of Serigalapally near Palakollu, was arrested. The driver said he did not know who was behind the ganja racket,” a senior DRI official said.
 
 The driver admitted that he knew he was transporting ganja, and said he had been asked to take it to Hyderabad. He was hired to drive the truck in which the stash was covered with plastic and hidden under a load of cabbage, a DRI officer said. Officers seized 440 packets, each containing 3kg of the drug.
 
 “The driver said he was supposed to drive the truck from   area to Vijayawada and from there another driver was to take over and head to Hyderabad. He did not have a mobile phone. He showed us the place where his reliever was to take over. Perhaps the other driver heard about the seizure. He did not report at the designated place when we went there,” an officer said. 
 
 The driver, who is from Andhra Pradesh, was arrested under the   (NDPS) Act.
