 became the most talked about show this season due to various controversies around it almost every day. Amidst all the housemates, the most controversial one except   was Swami Om.
 
  Swami Om entered the Bigg Boss 10 house as a commoner and went to all extents for TRPs and entertainment.
  
  A self-proclaimed swami, Om's behaviour irritated everyone in the house including host  . There was no episode of Salman where he didn't correct him for his behaviour.
  
  
 
  
  Om, who considered Priyanka Jagga his daughter, made everybody's life a hell inside the house. They went to such extreme that the father-daughter duo was chucked out of the house by Salman Khan.
  
  Swami disgusted everyone in a task by throwing his pee on Bani J and Rohan Mehra. Swami went so out of control that all the housemates had to lock him inside the jail and special security was called inside to take him out.
  
  After coming out of the house, Swami still didn't stop. From making remarks against Salman to disgusting comments on the housemates, Swami did it all to steal the limelight.
  
  
 
  
  Recently, we stumbled upon a viral video of   changing his clothes at Delhi railway station platform. Everyone around him stopped to look and made fun of him.
  
  Just a reminder, Om and Priyanka both were also banned from attending the grand finale of Bigg Boss 10.
