BHOPAL: Dreaded dacoit of yesteryears Malkhan Singh has urged the government to start paying in cash to   in mandis. Post-demonetisation, farmers are harassed and have been facing difficult time, said Malkhan, who has been elected national president of   community while addressing a press conference on Friday.

 “When farmers go to mandi, they should be given cash in hand and not cheques as has been happening after note bandi,” he said. After scrapping notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, farmers are the one of worst-affected. Besides, daily wage labourers are badly hit and a large number of them have lost employment, he said.

 He said he would be focused on restoration of a large number of forts and fortress. They include forts in Kach Bhuj and Junagarh, Chanderi and Garh Kundar in Tikamgarh district of  .
