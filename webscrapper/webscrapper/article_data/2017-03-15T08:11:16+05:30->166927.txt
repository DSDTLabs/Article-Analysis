BENGALURU: CM Siddaramaiah presents his 12th budget at 11.30 am today. This exercise was sewn up after spending 162 hours on marathon meetings with officials, 25 representatives from different organizations and, for the first time, convening a council of ministers' meeting to elicit opinions from them. A lot of expectation ride on the budget in the pre-poll year.

 Siddaramaiah, who holds the record of being the only Karnataka CM to present the highest number of budgets, is expected to focus on farm-loan waiver, announce sops to farmers facing the sixth drought in a row and populist schemes for the common man. With the GST coming into existence later this year, the chief minister has little scope to announce fresh taxes.
