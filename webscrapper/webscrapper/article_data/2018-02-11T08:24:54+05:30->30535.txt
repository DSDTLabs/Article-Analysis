BATHINDA: Punjab finance minister   Singh Badal has dared former deputy chief minister   for an open debate over state's finances, politics and corruption, including 'goonda tax', on TV, at a public rally or in the state assembly. 

 He said   would get 45 minutes to put his point and he would speak for 15 minutes and people would make their conclusion on who was a liability for the state.
 
 The showdown between estranged cousins reached a flashpoint on Friday when   (SAD) president Sukhbir, while addressing a rally in Bathinda district, termed Manpreet as a liability for the Amainder Singh government and asked the chief minister to oust him to sustain his government as the Akalis had done in 2010.
 
 On Saturday, Manpreet said the Punjabis know the reality of Sukhbir and how he had amassed wealth. "Till 2007 no one in Punjab had ever heard about 'goonda tax' and it was started by the Akalis during their 10 years of misrule in sand mining, cable and transport. "Sukhbir sees me as a hurdle in the upcoming parliamentary election of his wife   and wants to distract people from the real issues."
 
 While visiting the refinery in Phulokhari village of Bathinda on Februaary 8, Sukhbir had accused Manpreet's brother-in-law   (Jojo) of collecting 'goonda tax'. Sukhbir could not be reached for comments despite repeated attempts.
