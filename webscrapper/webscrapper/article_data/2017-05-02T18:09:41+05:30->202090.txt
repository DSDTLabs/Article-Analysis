MUMBAI: While all eyes have been on Egyptian   Ahmed’s health after she underwent bariatric   at Saifee Hospital, a city woman, who until two years back was among the heaviest Indian women, quietly underwent a second round of   surgery last month to lose further weight.

 While today Eman (36) weighs 176 kg—a drastic reduction from the 500kg that her sister had told international press of, in September 2016—Vasai’s 44-year-old Amita   has lost 175kg since she underwent the first operation in 2015. “Bariatric surgery has given me a new lease on life,” said Amita, who chose to undergo both her surgeries the same day—April 2—albeit two years apart. “I was over 300kg when doctors in the Pune hospital where I underwent the surgeries weighed me on a platform weighing scale,” said Amita, a share transfer agent.
 
 As she completes a month on Tuesday after the second operation, she weighs 125kg. “My life has changed drastically. Until 2015, I was confined to my bedroom for almost eight years as I could barely walk a few steps.’’ Four to five people were needed to help her stand. “Today, I step out of home every day and my mother teases me about it.’’   kept gaining weight through her teenage years; her parents took her to London for a consultation, but no reasons could be found. “It was only after my father passed away in 2014 that I got depressed and decided to do something about my weight.” Bariatric surgeon Dr Shashank Shah who operated on her said 7% of super obese people need second stage bariatric operation. “These surgeries should ideally help her lose 60% of her weight. Amita should stabilize between 75kg and 80kg in a year.”
