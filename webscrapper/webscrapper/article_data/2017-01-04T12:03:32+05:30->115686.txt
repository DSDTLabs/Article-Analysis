NAGPUR: “Savitribai and Jyotiba Phule did not just provide education to women or poor. In fact, they brought a revolution in education system in India as they were not only teachers but educationalists also,” said Hari Narke, a noted scholar and author, on Tuesday.

 Narke was speaking at a programme jointly organized by Buldhana Zilla Nagrik Mandal, Dhanwate National College and   to celebrate the birth anniversary of   Phule. 
 
 Narke said, “The work done by Phule in the early 19th century is relevant even today and will continue to be so in the future. Schemes launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for promoting education have similarities with the views of Phule.” Skill India, free primary education to all and increase in industrial and agricultural education have its origin in the movement launched by Phule, he added.
 
 Narke remembered the works of other great people who were inspired or were students of Phule like Tarabai Shinde and Tanubai Birje. He also talked about the reasons due to which education was not spreading in India as was desired. “In today’s world, knowledge distribution is necessary. But creation of knowledge is more important,” he added.
 
 The programme started with the dignitaries lighting a traditional lamp and garlanding the portraits of Savitribai, Jyotiba Phule and Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh. Baban Taywade, Khushal Bopche, MP Ajay Sancheti, Asha Pathan and Purushottam Patil were the guests.   was felicitated with Krantijyoti Savitribai Phule award for working for the cause of women. The award consisted of cash, bouquet, shawl and a memento. A calendar on Phule was also released. The programme was conducted by Komal Thakre.
