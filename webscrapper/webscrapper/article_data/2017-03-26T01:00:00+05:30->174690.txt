The buzz around KV Anand’s   started picking up ever since its trailer was released. With   and T Rajhendherr essaying lead roles in the film, along with  , the producer of the film hopes that the project will strike the right chord with the viewers. Interestingly, this is the third time that AGS Entertainment has teamed up with  . Producer Kalpathi S Aghoram says, “What I really like about Anand is that he trusts his subject more than the actors. He writes the script and then goes in search for the artistes.”

 On the alleged similarity the film has with Anand’s own Ko, he says, “The only similarity the two films has is the media backdrop. The subject Kavan deals with is different from the one Ko handled. Kavan touches upon a social issue, but it will not be preachy. The film revolves around television medium — it talks about the politics in that field. The story is such that it will be hard-hitting. At the same time, it will have ample romance and action.”
 
 The film, perhaps, is the biggest project in Vijay Sethupathi’s career. “The budget for a Vijay Sethupathi film generally does not exceed `12 crores. But our film’s budget is a little more than 18 crores. We didn’t want to compromise on the quality. I’m sure that his market will witness a rise after the release of the film,” points out Aghoram. 
 
 The production team is also elated about working with composer   and TR. “The former’s sound is in sync with today’s youth. He has given some great songs for the film. TR has been getting a lot of offers. But we are glad that he chose to work on our film. He is extremely cooperative and very patient.”
