KANPUR:   is very shocking and unfortunate, said national president of   and former chief minister   on Sunday.

 Talking to reporters in Etawah - his home district, he said, "Such an incident and that too happening on Republic Day was very unfortunate. Violence has no place in democracy." He appealed to the people of Kasganj to maintain calm and peace. 
 
 "People of different communities should respect each other. SP during its tenure worked to strengthen the 'Ganga-Jamuni' tehzeeb (culture) of the state. Our schemes were implemented without discrimination. Both Hindus and Muslims have worked hard to take the state forward. We demand action against the culprits responsible for inciting the violence but at the same time injustice should not be done to innocent people," Akhilesh said.
 
 "BJP believes in dividing people on communal lines, and there is a long history of this party dividing people for its political gains. In the last 10 months of its rule, the   succeeded in creating a void between the two communities which is dangerous," alleged the former chief minister. 
 
 Condoling the death of youth Chandan Gupta in Kasganj violence, he has demanded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh to Chandan's family. "Once normalcy is restored I will visit Kasganj and meet Chandan's parents and will try to do my best with whatever help they need," Akhilesh said.
