LUCKNOW:   was forced to delete a tweet about encounters in Uttar Pradesh. Quoting the notice issued by   (NHRC) to UP government on Monday, the curator handling Amnesty’s twitter account posted – Over 900 people have been killed in police encounters in Uttar Pradesh between March 2017 and January 2018. NHRC says   are ‘misusing their power in the light of an undeclared endorsement given by the higher ups’.

 From the time Yogi government took over, police department have gone all canons after the criminals with total encounters touching 1,000 mark in less than a year. Chief minister has also endorsed the strong action of department at multiple forums stating – police in UP will respond to a bullet with a bullet.
 
 Social media cell of UP police noticed the post and immediately rebutted Amnesty’s claims. In a smart but punchy reply the department responded – Dear Amnesty we beg our pardon but there’s a major human error in ur numbers, unless U have redefined D injured & dead alike! With due respect to the 37 dead V request you to respect the ones alive & Not declare them dead! We’ll make sure our legal notice is better researched.
 
 The department’s stand on the matter evoked a lot of response with one of its followers tweeting – Bang Bang! Twitter encounter by UP police. The backlash forced Amnesty to pull down the incorrect tweet and posted later that over 900 people have been killed or injured in UP.
