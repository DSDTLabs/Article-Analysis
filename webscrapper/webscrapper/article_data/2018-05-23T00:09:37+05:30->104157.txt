Pune: Automotive and defence forgings maker, Bharat Forge, reported a Q4 net that was half of the net profit it posted in the same period previous year, hurt by an impairment it took on one of its investments.

 In the three-month period ended March 2018, the company posted a stand-alone net profit of Rs100 crore against Rs208 crore a year ago. The company had to make an impairment provision of over Rs130 crore on investments in certain non-core and now, not so profitable, assets.
 
 The company said it had made a total income of Rs1,500 crore in the quarter against Rs1,205 crore a year ago. The cost of raw material also jumped up 38% to Rs535 crore.
 
 In the financial year ended March 2018, the company, on a consolidated basis, posted a net profit of Rs754 crore on a total income of Rs8,557 crore. This was against Rs711 crore net profit on a total income of Rs6,717 crore in the fiscal ended March 2017.
 
  to acquire  
 
 Pune: City-based salary advance company, Early Salary, said it had acquired CashCare — a financial technology company — to introduce the “shop now, pay later” option on a much larger scale.
 
 The company did not disclose the value at which it acquired the Mumbai-based CashCare but Akshay Mehrotra, co-founder and CEO, Early Salary, said the amount “was insignificant because the company had so far raised seed capital only”.
 
 Mehrotra said the checkout feature that the company would offer now would be similar to Bajaj Finance’s lending mechanism. He said the acquisition would play well into the company’s strategy of growing its loan book from Rs60 crore a month currently to Rs500 crore a month in the near future.
 
 “We have aggressive plans but the growth can only happen when consumers are given other options,” Mehrotra told TOI. He said the company plans to get 15-20% of its total loans from this pay-later mechanism.
 
 Early Salary primarily lends to young individuals who require short-term salary advances prior to their payday.
