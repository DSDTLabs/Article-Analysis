Bhopal: The search for the perfect image of Gond   to chisel out a statue of her is over, but the monument will take some more time. 

 Bhopal Municipal Corporation has called for fresh tender for the statue, in which the Rani will be seated on a throne, say sources. She will occupy a picturesque spot along   and BMC is expected to spend over Rs 5.5 lakh for the pedestal on which her statue will be placed. 
 
 There are no images of the Seventeenth Century Gond Maharani, whose beauty was the stuff of legend. Wife of Nizam Shah, who ruled from  , she built the seven-storey   that overlooks Upper and Lower Lakes. Her statue will be located next to the water pump near her palace, which is now an ASI-protected monument. 
 
 Chief minister   had announced installation of a statue of the Gond queen in 2016, soon after inaugurating the new cable stay bridge. But the problem was finding a likeness of her. Just like   ruler  , whose statue watches over Upper Lake, no sketch or image of the Gond Queen has ever been found.
 
 Sources say an image of Rani Kamlapati has now been finalised. “A high-level government committee has finalized a statue of the Gond Queen sitting on a throne and overlooking Upper Lake,” said an official, refusing to give any more details.
 
 Due to lack of bidders, the original tender was cancelled and fresh bids were invited. It is not clear if permission from ASI has been taken for the project. Earlier this year, BMC redeveloped a wall along Kamla Park within 50 meters of the ASI-protected palace.
 
 When Nizam Shah and then Queen Kamlapati ruled over these parts, Ginnaur was the capital and Bhopal a prosperous village. A charming Gond legend describes how on moonlit nights Rani Kamlapati would emerge from her waterside palace and float on the lake, carried afloat by a lotus flower and attended to by 500 maidens following her in rowing boats.
