PATNA: A day after   allotted ‘cycle’ symbol to UP CM  , RJD boss   on Tuesday said he and his son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav would campaign in his favour in the assembly election in the neighbouring state.

 Lalu also urged Samajwadi Party founder and his ‘samdhi’ Mulayam Singh Yadav to end internal strife in the SP’s first family at the earliest and contest the election unitedly to check split in secular votes.
 
 “I, along with Tejashwi, will campaign for Akhilesh to ensure his return as UP chief minister,” Lalu told reporters here. He also said his party would not contest the UP polls and, instead, strengthen the alliance of secular parties which would be formed by SP, Congress and other like-minded parties.
 
 Taking the side of Akhilesh in the Samajwadi ‘pari-war’, Tejashwi tweeted, “New Era. New Politics. Akhilesh is Mulayam.” His tweet further reads, “Desh mein UP vishesh hai, jaruri Akhilesh hai (Akhilesh is necessary because UP poll is special for the country)”. 
 
 Tejashwi’s youngest sister Raj Lakshmi is married to Akhilesh’s nephew and Samajwadi Party’s Mainpuri MP Tej Pratap Singh Yadav. The Mainpuri MP and Lalu’s son-in-law, who was initially with Mulayam, is learnt to have now sided with Akhilesh in the family feud, RJD sources said. 
 
 Earlier on Monday, while addressing a programme at the State Congress office here, Lalu said Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s daughter   and Akhilesh’s wife Dimple Yadav had already formed an alliance for poll-bound Uttar Pradesh and the RJD and the Congress would campaign together in the neighbouring state.
 
 The RJD chief said he spoke to Sonia a week ago over phone and she agreed to campaign together in UP. “I told Sonia ji that UP election is not only for a state, but for the entire country. The UP election results will decide the future course of country’s politics,” Lalu said.
