GURUGRAM: An   response from the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG) states that only one micro   treatment plant (STP) has been set up in the city till now. The lone plant in the city treats 25 kilo litre sewage per day.

 The MCG planned to install 56 STPs in the entire district, one in every village, in 2015. 
 
 “As of now, only one decentralised micro STP has been installed in front of ITI Lunch Park in Sector 14 for treating sewage water for irrigation purpose of this park. The quantity of the recycled water of this micro STP is 25 kilo litre per day,” states the RTI response by MCG (a copy of which is with the TOI).
 
 Currently, more than 200 million litre per day (MLD) of untreated water flows to the main Najafgarh drain that ultimately goes down into the   river. The city has three drains that are linked to the main drain.
 
 The RTI response also states the capacity of the lone STP in the city can be decreased.
 
 “This (current capacity) may be decreased owing to the availability of sewage water. The output of the recycled water is severely affected when the sewer line water is afflicted with industrial effluents like heavy metals/chemicals,” the RTI further states.
 
 In 2015, when the   (NGT) asked the corporation to submit a detailed action plan to check the discharge of untreated waste water into the Najafgarh drain which pollutes the Yamuna river, many operational gaps were found in it, according to the   (HSPCB).
 
 Meanwhile, an official from MCG said that plans are underway to set up more STPs. “We are finding it a little difficult to find space. However, an action plan was prepared by the corporation to set up STP at various places,” said an MCG official.
