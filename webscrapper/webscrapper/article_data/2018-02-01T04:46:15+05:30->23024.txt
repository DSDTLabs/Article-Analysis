MUMBAI: Notices for public hearing for cutting/transplanting 2,665 trees at   are expected to be issued soon, said civic sources. The trees are to be cut for the   car shed.

 Zoru  , an activist who has been following up on issue, said the first approval to cut three trees at   and transplant 20 was sanctioned by municipal commissioner   in December last year. The information was obtained under the RTI Act. Mehta used his powers under the new tree cutting policy that allows a commissioner to sanction cutting of 25 trees without the nod of the Tree Authority. The trees were to be cut/transplanted for construction of the launching shaft at Sariput Nagar.
 
 Prior to this, another proposal to cut 49 trees for the casting yard abutting the   was put up before the commissioner. The deputy municipal commissioner had noted the matter was sub-judice.
 
 “If there is no stay order from the National Green Tribunal, what is the harm in putting this up before the Tree Authority immediately?” Mehta had noted. The Tree Authority is yet to sanction this proposal.
 
 In August 2015, the NGT had directed the BMC to maintain status quo. “Since then, BMC has not granted permission for any activity, including laying of electricity cables or construction of toilets for the tribal hamlets in Aarey,” said Bhathena. The activist pointed out that in October last year when the suburban collector granted permission for excavation, one of the conditions was that no tree would be cut in the process.
 
 Currently, the Tree Authority has no tree expert. Mehta said the law says a tree expert is desirable but not mandatory.
