BAREILLY: An FIR was lodged against two city-based doctors at Kotwali police station on Friday in a case relating to amputation of a newborn’s leg just a little over a month after her birth. The baby’s parents had accused the doctors of  .

 The matter was taken to court after which police registered a case against child specialist Dr Ravi Khanna and gynecologist Dr Neera Agarwal under sections 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. While Dr Khanna has been accused of negligence leading to the baby girl’s leg amputation, Dr Agarwal is alleged to have purposefully referred the child to Dr Khanna to make money.
 
 It was nothing short of a nightmare for a Bareilly based couple Rajeev Gangwar and Durgesh Patel as their newborn daughter’s limb was amputated on June 17 following major infection in her right leg. The girl’s parents had alleged negligence and a panel of three doctors was constituted by former chief medical officer Vijay Yadav to look into the case.
 “I have already made a formal deposition in front of the Medical Council of India and have explained my side of the story. A medical team is looking into the case. I have nothing to fear as I haven’t done anything wrong,” Dr Khanna told TOI. Meanwhile, Dr Agarwal was not available for her comment. 
 
 “Our daughter was under the supervision of Dr Khanna, but he chose to travel out of station for work. He continued monitoring the case and instructed his team over the phone. During this period, her condition deteriorated,” Rajeev Gangwar, the baby girl’s father said.
