MUMBAI: A man from Mumbai who surrendered, claiming to have been hired by extremists to derail trains, has now admitted under questioning that he concocted the story for a reward or a job in the railways.

 Vasant Kumar Yadav, originally from UP, confessed before the UP ATS that he lied. On December 29, Yadav had walked into BJP's Mumbai office in  , and met railway activist Subhash Gupta. Yadav told Gupta he knew about a gang recruiting youth for sabotage. Gupta alerted the RPF, which then questioned Yadav. He told them a Bihar ring had trained him in subversive activities, which raised fears about his links to the recent derailments near Kanpur (see graphic).
 
 The Maharashtra ATS was roped in. “We quizzed him early this month and found several loopholes,“ said ATS chief  . The ATS then allowed Yadav to go. When UP ATS took Yadav into custody for questioning, it found he had lied to get a job or a reward from the PM. UP ATS took Yadav to the places he mentioned as `training spots', but did not find any evidence. Moreover, they found he was in his UP village at the time and not in Mumbai as claimed. He is likely to be subjected to a lie detector test now.
 
 Yadav had said the Bihar gang was led by one Suresh.When questioned by Mumbai police, he said the group lured unemployed youths by paying them Rs 70,000 each. Cops were startled by his claim that two men from his training camp had carried out an operation after being paid the amount. Yadav told police these details at a time when Bihar police had already busted a ring, which may have received funds from the ISI to derail trains in the country.
 
 This gang reportedly admitted to causing a derailment of the   near Kanpur on November 20, 2016, which claimed 140 lives.
