BHUBANESWAR: A massive fire broke out at a   area here on Monday. While no loss of life or injury was reported, assets worth crores of rupees were gutted in the inferno. Firefighters attributed the cause of fire to electric short circuit. 

 “We engaged 12 fire tender vehicles to douse the fire, which had spread to Lingaraj Biscuit Private Limited’s godown and plant area. Huge quantities of biscuits and other raw materials were stashed in the storeroom,” said deputy fire officer Ramesh Majhi said. Majhi said the factory did not possess fire safety certificate. A team of   was also stationed to assist the fire brigades to control the blaze.
 
 The intensity of the fire was so massive that the firefighters took over 10 hours to douse the flame. Sources said the fire mishap occurred around 3 am. Nobody was present in the factory when the incident occurred, police said. Owing to absence of adequate entry and exit points at the mishap site, the fire brigade mobilised bulldozers to demolish the plant’s walls to spray water. 
 
 Officials of the factories and boilers directorate rushed to the spot and sealed the area. “We will conduct an inquiry to find out the cause of the mishap. We will also find out whether the company adopted adequate safety measures to deal with hazardous situations. The plant will not be allowed to operate untill our inquiry is over,” said deputy director (safety) of factories and boilers Malay Kumar Pradhan. 
 
 Sources said the directorate last year initiated legal action against   for not complying with safety standards, prescribed by the government. “We registered a case against the company in trial court in December last year. The company was asked to adopt on-site emergency action plan to handle crisis situations. But the company had ignored the safety standard. The case is still under trial in court,” said Kamalendu Mohapatra, director of factories and boilers. Despite repeated attempts, the company officials were unavailable for comment.
