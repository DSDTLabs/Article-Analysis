MUMBAI: The daily   has gone down to its lowest ever: 25.9 lakh. It is a sharp fall of 40% in the past seven years, if one goes by the figures for 2009-10, when the transport undertaking boasted of having a daily commuter strength of 43.7 lakh.

 This was revealed at the   meeting by BJP member Sunil Ganacharya, who was referring to the numbers for February. He attributed the drop to a lot of factors including unavailability of buses for a longer time at stops.
 
  
  
 Ganacharya said, “BEST has done precious little to improve its performance as well. Its electronic display boards on buses are not working properly in many vehicles, and the e-ticketing system has almost failed with a sizeable number of defunct handheld machines.” He said that passengers had to wait for a long time at stops for buses to arrive.
 
 According to Congress member Ravi Raja, the decrease in fleet and cutting down of routes lately can also be blamed to some extent for the decline. “If we have a good number of buses on all routes, citizens will board our buses instead of switching to other modes of transport,” he stated.
 
 Another key reason, said a committee member, was congestion on roads which did not guarantee that a commuter would reach his/her destination on time. So several passengers preferred to skip buses for alternative modes like trains or Metro. Poor frequency and late arrival of buses was another cause. The wait is sometimes as long as half an hour, and this frustrates commuters who switch to share autos or taxis, a member said.
 
 According to transport experts, the increase in fares – hiked 167% between 2010 and 2017 – is also a factor. The latest hike was spared for commuters travelling distances up to 4 km, but those on longer routes had to face hikes from Re1 to Rs12. “This will only bring falling ridership, growing congestion on roads, longer travel time and rising deficit,” said transport analyst Hussain Indorewala.
