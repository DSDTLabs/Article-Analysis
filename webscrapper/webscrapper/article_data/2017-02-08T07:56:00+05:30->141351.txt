GURUGRAM: Brisk winds, lesser fog and moderate temperature have had a cumulative effect on the overall pollution levels across Gurgaon in the last five days that sent alarming levels of   crashing, officials told TOI.

 The PM 2.5 level, which was 288.68 micro grams per cubic metre on February 2, came down to 119.89 on Tuesday. The   index (AQI) has also improved since Monday. The maximum temperature recorded 22 degrees on Tuesday, while the minimum slid to 10 degrees.
 
 “Winds don’t let the particular matter to stagnate in the air. And with all these three parameters in place, which is shallow fog, rising temperatures and wind movement, the pollution levels have come down drastically,” said Devendra Pradhan, a senior scientist at Indian Meteorological Department. 
 
 
  
 Pradhan said Gurugram and other parts of the NCR region will continue witnessing slight rise in temperatures for the next couple of weeks. “The temperature though would still hover in moderate condition. There won’t be much cold, but there won’t be much heat either,” he said.
 
 Though the pollution has witnessed the drastic improvement over the last five days, the concentrations levels of PM 2.5 still wavered between the dangerous levels. For instance, Tuesday’s 119.89 µg/m3 is twice as much as the permissible limit. Prolonged exposed to PM 2.5 can cause acute respiratory illnesses.

 Officials of   (HPCB) said that lower pollutions levels will persist for some more days. “Lower pollution concentration is there because there has been road cleaning exercise done by MCG near the site where AQI monitor is installed,” an official said.
