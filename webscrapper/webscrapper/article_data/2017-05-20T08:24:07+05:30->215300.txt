CHANDIGARH: The Chandigarh police's vigilance department has started investigating cops in the proclaimed and summon cell (PO cell) for allegedly taking bribes from accused persons and not presenting them in court.

 Vigilance department officials say that they have found this illegal practice to be most common in cases related to the consumer court. This has caused undue delay in executing court orders in a number of cases. The officials have registered an FIR against unknown staff in the PO cell for non compliance with court orders.Names of the accused will be included in the FIR after investigation. Vigilance officials told TOI that they have received a number of complaints regarding the cops. The cops would receive a summons from consumer court and instead of arresting the accused, they would file a status report that accused was not there when they reached his home or that he had left the place before they reached the spot. 
 
 The vigilance department became suspicious after the list of absconding accused kept increasing with every passing day . Sources in the vigilance department said that although they haven't named anyone in the FIR, they have found lapses by two cops. They intend to name them after completing investigations and getting concrete evidence.
 
 Last month, PO cell offi cials arrested  , son of former   councillor   but it turned out to be case of mistaken identity. They mistook   for another accused. When Vikas was produced in court, he pleaded that he had nothing to do with the case, but had been picked up and was released.The actual accused in the case were still at large. Vikas had threatened to file a criminal case against the erring cops in local court at the time.
