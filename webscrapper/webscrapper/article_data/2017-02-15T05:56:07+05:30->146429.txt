CHENNAI:   to parts of   will be disrupted for three days from Thursday to Sunday to facilitate maintenance work at the desalination plant in Nemmeli. 

 South Chennai areas like Adyar, Besant Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur, parts of Velachery and Tharamani, Kottivakkam, Palavakkam, Perungudi, ECR (Neelankarai and Injambakkam), Old Mahabalipuram Road (Okkiam Thoraipakkam, Karapakkam, Sholinganallur, Semmencheri) may experience shortage from 6am on February 16 to 6am on February 19.
 
 Chennai metrowater has appealed to the public in these areas to store sufficient water in advance and contact the concerned area engineers for supply of water through mobile water tankers for urgent requirements.
 
 The desalination plant in Nemmeli supplies around 100 million litres of water per day (mld). In January, the civic body had reduced supply of water to the city from 831 mld to 550mld, owing to dwindling resources. 
 
 The storage levels in the four reservoirs that cater to the city the lakes in Red Hills, Cholavaram, Chembarambakkam and Poondi stand at just 14% against their total capacity of 11,057 million cubic feet (mcft). They are largely relying on Krishna water, which continues to trickle into Poondi reservoir, to boost storage.
