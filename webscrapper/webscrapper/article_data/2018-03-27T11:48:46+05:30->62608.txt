SURAT: Surat was one of the first few cities in India to have gone open defecation free (ODF) in 2016. However, a new study on the labour conditions in Surat’s textile industry by Vadodara-based   ( ) revealed that urinals don’t exist in 30%   including power loom, textile processing, as well as embroidery and garment units. 

 Survey carried out at 48 textile units in various industrial areas across the city, which included 28 textile processing units, 10 powerloom units, seven embroidery units and one each of hosiery, garment and a composite mill. About 50 respondents filled up the questionnaire, among which three were female workers. 
 
 The study reveals that 10% units do not have toilet facilities and most units do not have separate toilet facilities for women workers. In hosiery units, there are restrictions on how many times workers can visit toilets in a day. 
 
 In textile processing units, where number of female workers are 20 against 680 males, they do not have separate toilets for females. The situation in the powerloom units is worse as only few number of industrial areas have toilets and urinals, while most do not have urinal facilities and workers are forced to defecate in the open. 
 
 Jagdish Patel, director of PTRC, told TOI, “A female helper in a processing unit working told us that since past 10 years, the workers defecate in the open as there are only two toilets and no urinals. This unit employ 68 male and 20 female workers. This is a blatant violation of the Factory Act.” tnn
