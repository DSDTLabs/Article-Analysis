NEW DELHI: The Law Commission has recommended amendment to the Advocates Act to allow lawyers a day's token strike in compelling circumstances with the prior approval of the bar council concerned even though it suggested barring lawyers from practising if they indulged in chronic disruption of court work.

 The tough stand taken in the report submitted to the government by the commission headed by Justice B S Chauhan was because of the large number of working days lost in courts because of lawyers' strikes across the country.
 
 In Uttarakhand's Dehradun district court, 455 days were lost because of advocates' strike between 2012 and 2016. In Haridwar district, it was 515 days for the same period. In UP, Muzaffarnagar saw court work suffer for 791 days between 2011-16. In the same period, in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram, lawyers struck work for 687 days. The law panel said frequent strikes by lawyers were untenable as the reasons behind such disruption had no co-relation with grievances against the judiciary. 
 
 Some of the reasons for strikes were inter-state water dispute, amendment to Sri Lankan constitution, earthquake in Nepal, moral support to movements by activists, heavy rain, religious occasions like Shradh, Agrasena Jayanti and even 'kavi sammelan'.
 
 However, the commission suggested a grievance redressal mechanism for lawyers in every district headed by the district judge. “The purpose of this committee would be to deal with the day to day issues and grievances of advocates. In case of lawyers' grievance against a judicial officer, the bar association may raise it before the chief justice of the concerned HC,“ it said.
 
 The commission also noticed a problem faced by superior courts where raw law graduates started appearing without gaining sufficient training in subordinate courts on court etiquette and craft. It also suggested reviewing the regulatory mechanism of legal profession in India.
