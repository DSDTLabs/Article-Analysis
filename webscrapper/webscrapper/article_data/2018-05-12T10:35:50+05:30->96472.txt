LUDHIANA: Ludhiana MP, Ravneet Singh Bittu on Friday, lashed out at Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) saying, “Akali leaders had always preferred to include chapters of 'Badal and Majithia' families into the history books and ignored   for which they don’t deserve right to speak on the issue. They are indulging into petty politics as they have no real issue against the   government which only one agenda and that is progress and development of Punjab.” 

 Bittu said this while inaugurating the development project worth Rs 6.99 crore in Atam Nagar constituency. Some of the works include repair of roads in D-block at the cost of Rs 77 lakh, repair of roads near Gurdwara Santokhsar Sahib worth Rs 86 lakh, works of Rs 84.34 lakh in Nirmal Nagar and Rs 84.92 lakh in Dugri Main Market, Rs 1.56 crore for Jawaddi and Pakhowal road, Rs 55.83 lakh for Guru Nanak Colony's roads, works of Rs 54.10 lakh in Chet Nagar and repair of roads around Gill Chowk and Dhuri railway lines at the cost of Rs 31 lakh. Speaking on the occasion he said that with the Congress led new civic body taking on reins of the city into its hands, the pace of development will get double and Ludhiana will have the best infrastructure in the state for which state government led by Amarinder Singh would leave no stone unturned.
