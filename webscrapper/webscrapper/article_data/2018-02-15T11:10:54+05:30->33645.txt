VISAKHAPATNAM: District collector   held a review meeting on anaemia-caused   on Wednesday. 

 Kumar said medical authorities and PHCs must focus on encouraging institutional deliveries, especially in remote areas, and added that awareness camps must be held to bring various government medical schemes to the notice of the public. 
 
 “Anaemia is a main reason for maternity deaths in the agency and remote areas of the district. This is mainly because of non-availability of proper nourishment and lack of awareness about medicines that would help make pregnant women stronger and healthier,” Kumar said. The collector urged PHCs and medical authorities to focus on supply of iron tablets, repeatedly conduct monitoring surveys to monitor the health of pregnant women and frequent medical camps. 
 
 He said a special training camp for paramedic helps would be held in Araku, Chintapalli and Paderu mandals involving medical staff as well as sarpanchas of various villages.
