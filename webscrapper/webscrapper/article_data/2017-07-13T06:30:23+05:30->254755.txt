LUCKNOW: Expressing unhappiness over the instances of ‘show-off’ staged by local authorities during his visit to  , chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi has issued   to them to desist from making such  . His   has issued an order in this regard a copy which has been sent to all DMs and district police chiefs.

 The order signed by the CM’s principal secretary SP Goyal says: "It has been seen during the CM's visit to other districts that despite directives, administration makes special arrangement like laying red carpet, using towel of a particular colour and using special sofas etc." 
 
 “There has been a clear directive from the CM that officials should not make any special arrangements or do anything that leads to inconvenience of the common people,” the order further says.
 
 Goyal's order mentions two specific visits -- one to a martyr's house in Deoria and other in Gorakhpur -- when local officials spread out red carpet, put up sofa and air-conditioners. All these stuffs were taken off just after the CM’s went away. The matter was widely reported in the media, inviting a strong reaction from Yogi, who had expressed extreme unhappiness over the arrangement and directed not to repeat such acts in future. But when even after his verbal order the officials didn’t refrain from resorting to the ‘show business’, his office issued a terse written order.
 
 During the CM's visit to other districts, or even during various programmes in Lucknow, officials have been quite regularly using saffron towel. What's more, even the sign boards on the background of the stage, too are mostly saffron in colour. The press conference at Tilak Hall on Tuesday after the first Budget of the Yogi government also had a signboard in saffron colour.
