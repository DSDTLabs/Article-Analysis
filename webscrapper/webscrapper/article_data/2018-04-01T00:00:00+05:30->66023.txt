Something comfortable like an athleisure outfit, track pants and a nice ganji with a jacket or otherwise just my favourite pyjamas.

 
 
    because he’s so versatile. My favourite international designer is Zadig & Voltaire. I also like the new   collection.
 
 
  What our grandmothers have been telling us – drink a lot of water! Sleep is important for the skin and so is the goodness of aloe vera. Also, stick to just one face wash and one moisturiser – something that suits you.
 
 
    once told me ‘less is more’. I swear by that because anything overdone is overkill.
 
 
  I love the flared high-waist jeans. But I only wear them when I’m wearing high heels and I don’t wear those that often. I like skinny jeans as they look good on me with a high waist, for sure.
 
 
  I am always in a rush. So just lots of mascara and a nice pop of colour on the lips for me.
 
 
  The fringe made no sense to me. On bags it was fine dangling out, on clothes it was a bit weird.
 
 
  Mascara – it’s quick to put on and easy to wipe out.
 
 
  I tend to buy a lot of bags and shoes. But I do use them. So, I don’t overbuy anything. I’m a controlled person.
 
 
 
  Kangana Ranaut. She’s style and chic.
 
  Blue, white, beige and nude tones, which look good on me. Black would be another favourite.
 
  My gym clothes, as they are the most comfortable.
 
  Nude
 
  Something appropriate for the occasion. But my go-to is dewy skin with a pop of colour on the lips – pink maybe!
