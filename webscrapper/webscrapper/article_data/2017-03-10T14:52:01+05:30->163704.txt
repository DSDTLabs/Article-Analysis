In 2015, the   (CBFC) had demanded that two kisses in the   film Spectre "be cut down by half", while films like  's 'Magic Mike XXL',   and  's erotic drama 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and its sequel 'Fifty Shades Darker', which had a 2017 February opening, were not permitted to release in India.

 But now, in a surprise move, the censors have gone easy on the ' ' sequel and passed a shot of   stripping in a phone booth in which you can clearly see his naked butt. The clip, certified 'A', has been attached to the   starrer 'Logan' in the theatres from today.
 
  
  
 Confirming the news, the spokesperson of Fox Star Studios told Mirror, "We are excited that the 'Deadpool 2' clip will be out from today with 'Logan' and played the way it was intended to -without any cuts."
 
 While speaking to Mirror (February 4, 2016) at the time of the 'Deadpool's release last year, Ryan had wondered how his upcoming film which was liberally sprinkled with expletives, would be screened in India.
 
 "You always prefer to have your movie shown in its original form, but I guess its better that audiences get to watch it in an altered version than not watch at all," he had reasoned.
 
 Mirror has learnt that the studio muted out the word 'mother***er' which can be clearly heard in the clip that is available online, before it was submitted to the Indian censors.However, other four-letter words in the clip have been allowed to go unchallenged by the CBFC.
