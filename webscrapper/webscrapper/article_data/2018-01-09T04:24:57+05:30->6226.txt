Chief minister   has directed the   to shift out   in   after local residents complained toxic fumes from the melting and polishing units were causing health issues. 

 Bhuleshwar resident Harkishan Garodiya who met the CM at a public grievance redressal meeting at   on Monday said almost all the homes in the congested Kalbadevi and Mumbadevi areas have such units which are a major fire safety hazard.
 
 “Every day toxic fumes are released from the chimneys that have risen from these units. Many locals have been facing bronchial issues,” Vimal Sheth, another resident of the area, told TOI. 
 
 Residents say chemicals like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and hydrochloric acid are used in these workshops with nearly 76 chimneys releasing poisonous gases. 
 
 Fadnavis has asked the BMC to serve these units a notice and start the process of shifting them out in the next three months to an alternative location in Mumbai itself. 
 
 Officials in Mantralaya say BMC will not find it difficult to act against these units as most of them are illegal and are also violating environment norms. 
 
 However, the move did little to alleviate the anxiety of residents. They say similar orders were issued earlier too, but no action was initiated. 
 
 In 2001, there was a huge fire in one of these units and 24 people were killed. After the incident, the government had said they would shift the units in one month. “But that has not yet happened,” said a resident.
