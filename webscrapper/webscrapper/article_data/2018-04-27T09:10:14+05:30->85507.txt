GANGTOK: Former Indian football captain  , along with some politicians and professionals from Sikkim, on Thursday announced the formation of their regional party Hamro Sikkim. Hamro means ‘ours’ in Nepali language.

 The announcement ends all speculation over Bhutia’s next political move after he quit the   on February 26. Bhutia, addressing a media conference at the   of India in New Delhi, said: “This party has been formed by the people of Sikkim and we dedicate it to them. I am not here to become the party president or the chief minister but to inspire the people in Sikkim and the country to join politics. Good people should come forward in order to cleanse politics.”
 
 Bhutia touched upon a number of pressing issues of the hill state, including ‘massive corruption’ under the Pawan Chamling-led Sikkim   government. “Corruption is a major problem in Sikkim but the government has barred CBI from investigating. We also have the second highest unemployment rate and the highest suicide rate in the country, which need to be addressed,” he said.
 
 Insiders said Hamro Sikkim will be launched in Sikkim within May, when the names of post-holders and executive members will be announced. The wedges between Bhutia, a native of Tinkitam in  , and   had deepened irreversibly during the 104-day Darjeeling strife.
