BENGALURU:   projects undertaken by the   (BDA),   and other urban housing development authorities will come under the purview of the   (Regulation and Development) Act.

 This means that these government agencies will have to complete their projects in time or face action as per the Act. A senior BDA official said there is every possibility that BDA might stop developing layouts now on, and focus on apartments.The former involves acquisition of large tracts of land, which is challenging and invariably delays projects.
 
 Layout development schemes launched by BDA in the past 10 years have been mired in controversies related to possession and completion. In the case of Arkavathy layout, BDA had planned to give possession of sites in three years. But only a few buyers have got possession, even after nearly 14 years. In 2007, the BDA announced the Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Layout and set a deadline to complete it in three years, but still many are awaiting possession. The BDA and other housing development authorities were hoping for exemption from   since they are registered as non-profit, charitable organizations. Karnataka housing secretary Kapil Mohan said the Act covers all bodies (private and public) that develop real estate projects for sale to the public.
 
 Madhusudhan S, a property consultant, said the implementation of RERA will impact housing projects being developed by government agencies.“It will be beneficial to buyers because all property related disputes would have to be addressed in 60 days,“ he said.
