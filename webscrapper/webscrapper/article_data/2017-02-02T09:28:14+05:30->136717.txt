LUCKNOW:   players and stakeholders have different viewpoints on the  . While some welcomed the measures announced by the government, others found them lacking. Industry players also pointed at the slow execution of government policies in Uttar Pradesh.

 While everyone welcomed the incentives offered to builders undertaking affordable projects, they also pointed out how they will have to pay tax on notional rent on unsold inventory within a year. “The sector has remained extremely weak for three years. More was needed. Focus on just affordable housing is not enough,” said  , joint managing director of a real estate developer, who dubbed the budget as lacking.
 
 Chief managing director of another real estate firm, PN Mishra, said, “Every year, sops are announced for affordable housing. But nothing improves on the ground. We have undertaken two affordable projects in Allahabad and Lucknow. Though we have completed the formalities, we are yet to get benefits from the government. They should work on an effective execution.”
 
 But CREDAI UP president SK Garg was hopeful. “Very limited number of units below Rs 20 lakh are available in the city at present. A lot of families do not prefer to stay in government schemes. With easy financing to developers making affordable buildings, we will be able to provide units in the range of Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh,” said Garg.
