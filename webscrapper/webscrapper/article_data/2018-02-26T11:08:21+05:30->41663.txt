HYDERABAD: Collecting   is very difficult. In hardly 1% of  ,   are detected, said the   of  .

 “Fingerprints play an important role in murder cases. But now criminals have become smart enough to not leave any fingerprints on the crime scene. Nowadays fingerprints help us trace offenders mostly in property offence cases, such as theft, robbery and house burglary,” said N Venkanna, scientific officer of clues team in Hyderabad.
 
  
 Officials say there are nearly 60 crime scene officers in the clues team under Hyderabad commissionerate, apart from 17 photographers, videographers and assistants. One of the most difficult aspects of their job is to detect the identity of a charred body. “There are hardly any tissues or blood samples that can be extracted from a charred body,” said Vekanna.
 
 Elaborating more about the clues team, he said investigation and inspection of a crime scene was the most important part of their work. Though clues team is a part of the police department, it works separately.
 
 “Based on their suspicion, police interrogate and investigate, while we help them in linking the evidence to a criminal. Depending on the evidence, the team sometimes provides leads to an investigating officer, based on which the officer focuses on working in a particular direction. However, police and forensic team work separate mostly,” he added.
 
 When asked about the recent murder case of a baby girl in Uppal, whose severed head was found on the terrace of the accused’s house, he said blood stain analysis helped police find a lead in the case.
 
 “The accused tried to trick the police by filing the complaint himself. So, the team did not scan or inspect their house intensively. However, few days after the case came to the clues team, they managed to find the blood stain inside their house,” he said.
