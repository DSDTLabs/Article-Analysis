CHENNAI: The trekking expedition at Kurangani in Theni, which claimed the lives of 16 people, has brought focus on the now defunct trekking programmes once conducted by the   ( ). Treks were organised by the state-owned corporation in coordination with the forest department across Tamil Nadu until about eight years ago.

 Talking about its successful start, former TTDC tour manager N Ravi said that 28 treks were conducted across TN in six months when the state delved into exploring its adventure tourism prospects. “We had organised treks at Yelagiri,  , Kodaikanal,  ,   and   between September 2009 and January 2010, to promote adventure tourism. The general manager of the   wing, who was a senior forest department official on deputation to the tourism department, coordinated with authorities from his department for the trips,” he said. Safety was accorded high importance on these trips, with trekking allowed only during the day.
 
 Noting that the trips evoked huge response, Ravi, who was incharge of organising trekking tours said, “A study regarding the distance, route and period of visit would be done for every trip. Forest officials well versed with the hilly terrain and would accompany the trekkers ensuring safety.”
 
 However, curtains were drawn for the initiative due to little impetus given by the TTDC for its promotion, after the ecotourism wing allegedly became inactive. “There were attempts to revive it (trekking programmes) in 2012, but nothing materialised,” Ravi said.
 
 When contacted, official sources with the TTDC said that trekking programmes are no more organised by the corporation. “The post of general manager of the ecotourism wing has remained vacant because we are unable to get an officer from the forest department for the purpose,” a TTDC official added, when speaking about the initiative going inactive.
