Bhopal: The family of Akansha Sharma is distressed by the way her brother was roughed up by some mediapersons in Bhopal after her cremation on Saturday.

 “We are already in pain after hearing about the gory murder of our daughter. Despite knowing this some journalist in Bhopal roughed up my son who was not in any state of mind to talk to them. Are they not sensitive enough to under the feeling of someone who lost a near one?” Shivendra Sharma, Akansha’s father., told TOI on Sunday.
 
 According to police, a stringer attached with a national channel started the ruckus when Akansha’s brother Ayush refused to speak to the media at Subhash Nagar crematorium. “They blocked his way. One of them said ‘we will not let you go unless you give a bite’. When he tried to push through the crowd, a cameraperson lost balance and fell down after which some other mediapersons roughed him and put him on the ground. He was rescued by Bankura police personnel.”
 
 The ruckus didn’t stopped there. When Ayush was rushed to a car, someone took out the keys saying “you cannot leave unless you give a bite”. A Bengal police official stepped out and spoke to the media, said police.
 
 Circle Inspector Amitabh Sinha confirmed the incident and said, “Such behaviour was not expected from journalists. It’s unethical and cruel.”
 
 Akansha’s father recalled how Udyan visited them in Bankura in October and told them that he works “in the same Unicef office with her”. He stayed with them for two days. “When he came to my house I found him to be a gentleman. He behaved very nicely with us. I didn’t have the slightest inkling that he is a maniac and had already killed my daughter.”
