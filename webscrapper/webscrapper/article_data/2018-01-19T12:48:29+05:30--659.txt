COIMBATORE: About 50 people began an indefinite fast on the premises of   temple at Sullivan Street in the city on Thursday seeking an apology from lyricist Vairamuthu for his statements on Hindu deity Andal.

 The protesters said they were holding the fast in support of Srivilliputhur Jeeyar Sadagopa Ramanuja, who is holding a similar fast, until Vairamuthu renders an apology. They also asked Tamil filmmakers to boycott the lyricist. 
 
 Founder of   and Vivekanandar Peravai G R Jalendran, who headed the fast, demanded that Vairamuthu must go to Andal temple in Srivilliputhur and apologise there. “We also seek Tamil filmmakers to boycott him from now on,” he added.
 
 Women, who were gathered for the fast, said the lyricist had spoken ill of a woman who they deemed as god. “In the month of Margazhi, we recite Tiruppavai and   written by Andal. How can someone insult her,” said  , a protester.
 
 “Our Jeeyar, who never comes out of the mutt is out on the streets protesting now, so we too have come out in protest,” said another woman protester. “We want Vairamuthu to go and apologise to Andal in  ,” she added.
 
 When asked why they were protesting when Vairamuthu had clarified his statements twice in Twitter and also said he felt sorry if he had hurt anyone, the protesters said feeling sorry was not same as apologising.
