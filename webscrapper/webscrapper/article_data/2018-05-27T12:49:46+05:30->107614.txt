There is a lot of excitement around the upcoming Kannada   Amar, considering that it is the launch of   Ambareesh's son,  .
 
  Abishek has been working hard — on his acting skill and on his body — to make the right impact with his debut. We had reported earlier that Tanya Hope, who had studied with Abishek in London, was roped in as the female lead. And we can now confirm that the film kickstarts tomorrow.
  
  We have learnt that shooting will begin in Bengaluru, but huge portions of it will be shot abroad.
