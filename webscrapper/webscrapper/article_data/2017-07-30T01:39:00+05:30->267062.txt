Ludhiana: The city would soon get new challaning machines that would help trace stolen vehicles and vehicles that have already been challaned. The proposal for getting these machines has already been sent by the Ludhiana police for approval and by the end of next month, they would be provided. The machines are called POS (point-of-sale) machines, run by a special software developed by the Ministry of Roads, Transport, and Highways.

 While this machine would make challaning drivers easier, it would also help cops get more details of the vehicles. If one just fills the vehicle registration number or licence details of the driver, all the other details of the vehicle and driver would start flashing on the machine screen, of which a printout can also be taken. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-Traffic) Sukhkpal Singh Brar said: “The Ludhiana police have already sent a proposal for the machines, and we may get them soon.”
 
 Further, the official said that with the help of these machines, cops would also get details like whether the vehicle was also challaned earlier, in which states, and how many times, or if it was a stolen vehicle. This information would also help nab traffic violators and miscreants with stolen vehicles. These machines have already been launched in Jalandhar recently by ADGP (Law & Order) Rohit Chaudhary.
