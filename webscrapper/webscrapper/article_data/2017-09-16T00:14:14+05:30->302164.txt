Pune: Afghanistan’s Ambassador to India Shaida Mohammad Abdali on Friday said close ties between India and Afghanistan do not pose any threat to Pakistan and the latter needs to change its old narrative.

 “Both, Afghanistan and India, want peace with Pakistan,” Abdali told TOI on the sidelines of the ‘Pune Dialogue on National Security-2017’. He was responding to a query on Pakistan’s defence minister Khurram Dastgir’s statement that his country was reviewing ties with the US in the wake of a nexus between India and Afghanistan.
 
 Abdali said, “We hope Pakistan’s narrative will end. Neither Afghanistan nor India wants to harm Pakistan. Therefore, the proximity between the two countries should not be seen as a threat to Pakistan.”
 
 He said naming of Pakistan-based terror groups (Jaish-e-Mohammed, Lashkar-e-Taiba and the Haqqani network) in the BRICS declaration was a positive step. “This can take us to a situation where the region and global community will fight terrorism together,” he added.
 
 The ambassador acknowledged PM Narendra Modi’s efforts towards strengthening India-Afghanistan ties. “If the US, Russia, China and Iran join such efforts, it will serve the interest of everyone involved,” he said. 
 
 “We need to fight terrorism at root level and not get misled by the name of any particular terror group. We have to focus on terrorism as a single entity and fight it together,” he added.
