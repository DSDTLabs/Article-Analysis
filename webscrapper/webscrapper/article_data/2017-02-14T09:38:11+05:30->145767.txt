SHIMLA: Even after the death of a woman,   (SMC) is not speeding up the dismantling work they had initiated at   which is still posing threat to lives of people. 

 Everyday thousands of people stand at the spot to catch a bus but there are no safety barricades or signage while the work is going at a snail’s pace.
 
 In January, when Bhattakuffar resident Sunita Thakur (45) was waiting for a bus at Old Bus Stand, a part of the building part fell over her and four others which injured them badly. She could not survive her injuries and lost her life at   and Hospital, Shimla. After the incident, municipal commissioner (MC) Pankaj Rai had ordered inquiry and punishment for the responsible ones. But, the same situation is prevailing there as the work is being delayed.
 
 “Beautification or road widening is important in Shimla and should be done quickly,” Sanjauli resident Suresh Chauhan said. Dhali resident   said Local Bus Stand is very crowded and people are seen walking and waiting there entire day, but due to negligence of SMC, anyone can become a victim of an untoward incident.
 
 MC Rai said the dismantling work will take some time because it can only be done at night from 11pm to 5am. “But it is beneficial for the people as there is so much hotchpotch at Local Bus Stand which is getting cleaner and wider now for their convenience,” he added. He said that by Monday, the dismantling work will be completed after which they will start the same at Boileauganj. The building, from which the part had fallen down on a woman, was already in poor state but the matter is under inquiry right now which will clear everything, he added.
