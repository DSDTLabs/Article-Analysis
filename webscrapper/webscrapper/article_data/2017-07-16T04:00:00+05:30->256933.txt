Vadodara: An elderly woman was robbed of gold bangles and mobile phone by an unidentified woman in Nizampura on Saturday afternoon.

 The complainant Jyoti Mistry told the police in her complaint that an unidentified woman from a trust working for widows came to her on Saturday. She told Mistry that the trust is paying Rs 2,000 every month to widows who fall in the category of below poverty line (BPL).
 
 Police said that when Mistry agreed, the woman took her to Nizampura where she claimed the trustâ€™s office was. On reaching Nizampura, the woman asked Mistry to remove her gold bangles worth Rs 50,000 and her mobile phone in her purse as her photo needs to be clicked for the form.
 
 After taking the photo, the woman went inside a house in Bhawanipura Society and brought Rs 2,000 for Mistry. Later, she told her that she will have to meet her boss but before that she will go and bring the form for her. She asked Mistry to give her purse to her and wait for her.
 
 Police said that the accused woman, who according to Mistry was around 45-year-old went towards Delux crossroads and did not return. After waiting for half an hour, Mistry realized that she was cheated and has lost her gold bangles.
