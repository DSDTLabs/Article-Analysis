GHAZIABAD: A 17-year-old   XII student had gone missing from his home in Lohia Nagar on Saturday after failing in the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exam. His father   has filed a missing person’s complaint about his son   at Sihani Gate police station.

 Piyush, who is a businessman, told TOI, “Arnab was a student of science stream (Physics, Chemistry and Math) at Sanskar school. He went missing from home around at 1pm.” His father said Arnab had informed his younger sister  , a class X student, about his result and then left the home. “We initially thought that he would return after some time, but when he did not come back till evening we went and filed a complaint at the local police station,” said Piyush.
 
 Piyush said Arnab had torn his mark sheet before leaving the home and so the family is not sure in which subjects he failed.
 
 Looking at the sensitivity of the matter, the police have launched a manhunt to trace the boy. Cops have also taken the help of social media platforms like Twitter to spread the information about the missing boy. 
 
 This year, the pass percentage of class XII has improved to 83.01% from 82.02% last year.
