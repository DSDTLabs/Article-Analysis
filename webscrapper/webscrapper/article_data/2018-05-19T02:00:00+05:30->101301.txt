PATNA: A painting workshop-cum-competition was organised at Bihar Museum to mark the   on Friday.

 The theme of painting competition was ‘Sketch the most interesting object or antiquity at Bihar Museum’. As many as 70 students from the College of Arts and Crafts participated in the competition.
 
 “The aim of the workshop was to let the students know the importance of historical objects and antiquities. The idea was to connect the students with the museum, an institution of learning. Students were also provided guides, who briefed them about different prized possessions of the museum,” said Ranveer Singh, curator of Bihar Museum. 
 
 “The workshop was a mixture of history and art. Such public spaces, especially museums, offer an opportunity to us to explore, learn and have fun. We saw the museum’s collections, galleries and artefacts. The curators informed us about archaeology, miniature, paintings, history and other aspects,” said Amrita Kumari, a student pursuing bachelor’s in fine arts from College of Arts and Crafts.
 
 Director of Bihar Museum Md Yusuf said, “Museums are acknowledged for their archival and preservation work. On International Museum Day, we have pledged to increase social awareness about history, heritage, arts and culture in the modern world.”
