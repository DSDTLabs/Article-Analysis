CHENNAI: Weeks after attacking lyricist Vairamuthu for calling deity Andal a “dasi”, BJP national secretary   found himself in a soup on Wednesday for calling DMK Rajya Sabha MP   an “illegitimate child” of DMK president M  .

 Raja soon came under flak, with former Union minister and senior   leader P Chidambaram demanding to know the BJP’s stand on it. “There is no such thing as ‘illegitimate child’. All children are perfectly legitimate. Will the BJP please explain where it stands?” Chidambaram tweeted in a counter to Raja. “Every child has a mother and a father,” he added further, in a tweet in Tamil.
 
 Raja took to Twitter on Wednesday morning, after seemingly provoked by the tough questions posed to governor Banwarilal Purohit from journalists at a press conference on Tuesday. He wanted to know whether journalists will have the guts to ask such hard questions to Karunanidhi. His tweet, however, did not mention Karunanidhi and Kanimozhi by name.
 
 CPI state secretary R Mutharasan condemned Raja’s Twitter statement saying it was merely for publicity. “Raja has been inciting violence in the state through such irresponsible statements and he should be arrested under the Goonda’s Act,” Mutharasan said.
 
 “I don’t want to respond to what Raja has said. They either try to patronise you or intimidate you to force you out from public space. Those days are over and that is not going to happen. You cannot intimidate women any more,” Kanimozhi told TOI.
 
 Later in the day, BJP state president Tamilisai Soundarajan felt “disturbed” with people commenting on the personal life of women in public life. Director P Bharathiraja too reacted saying, “I condemn Raja’s indecent remarks...how dare you (Raja) sling mud on their relationship, you pervert.” He said “people like Raja who are trying to incite riots in TN must be punished”.
