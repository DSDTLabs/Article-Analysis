PALWAL: The   has once again landed in an embarrassing situation after an audit revealed discrepancies in the   data reported by districts in the state. In March,   district had reported that its sex ratio was 1,217 (1,000 boys for 1,217 girls) — the highest in the state for that month — when in contrast the sex ratio of the entire state for the month was 950. The chief minister himself had made the announcement about the “achievement”, and called it a historic moment too. 

 However, when some reports revealed that the district’s data was inaccurate, the chief minister office(CMO) conducted an independent audit, which confirmed the flaws. On Thursday, two district officials were suspended for fudging the data.
 
 In the absence of dedicated staff for registration of births, a sewadaar (peon-cum-gardener) of PMC, Manoj Kumar, has been compiling the information for years now. 
 
 The audit, conducted earlier this month, revealed that Palwal had reported birth of 237 boys and 402 girls in March. The figures were later corrected to 328 boys and only 313 girls, which brought the monthly district sex ratio at birth down to 983, instead of the lauded 1,217. 
 
 To save the face, the state government on Thursday ordered immediate suspension of PMC registrar Manender Singh and sub-registrar Sandeep Kumar. Singh holds the charge of executive officer of the urban local bodies department as well. He told TOI that he did not compile or check the data. “I had authorised the sub-registrar to get the work done by a clerk.” Sandeep too said he didn’t compile, or even sign the wrong report. 
 
 A secretary was appointed in 2015 to compile the data, but for a few months. After his tenure ended, Manoj has been compiling the data. an official said. “The error took place after he registered some boys as girls,” said an official. Palwal deputy commissioner Maniram Sharma said an inquiry would be conducted.
