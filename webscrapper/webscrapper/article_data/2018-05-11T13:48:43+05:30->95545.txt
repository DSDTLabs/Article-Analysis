PALANPUR: Radhanpur police have booked a 23-year-old call centre owner in the town for allegedly raping a law student after promising to marry her. 

 Along with the accused Keyur Patel, the police also booked his uncle and aunt Dr   and   and four Ahmedabad-based friends for abetting the crime. Though the woman was raped in December last year, she approached the police late on Wednesday night. She has also sent a copy of her complaint to Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) Shivanand Jha.
 
 The rape survivor told police that Keyur was her   and he had proposed to marry her despite knowing that she was a divorcee. On December 3 last year, Keyur allegedly took her for a movie in Ahmedabad and later forced her make a night halt in a hotel. He allegedly raped her there and clicked her obscene photos. Later, he assured the woman that all his relatives including uncle and aunt have agreed to their marriage.
 
 As per the complaint, Keyur, his four friends and uncle and aunt took her to Mount Abu between December 25 and January 1 where he again raped her after consuming liquor. Later, Keyur reneged on his marriage promise and told her to forget him.
 
 On March 2, 2018, when the woman contacted Suthar in his office at Ahmedabad, he allegedly hurled abuses at her and asked her not to come again. “Being helpless, I then filed a complaint with   police station in Ahmedabad in this regard. However, I later withdrew the complaint after his advocate promised to strike a compromise with him,” the woman said. She said that the accused threatened to make her pictures viral.
