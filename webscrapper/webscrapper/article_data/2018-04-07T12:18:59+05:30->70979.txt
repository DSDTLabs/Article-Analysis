BHUBANESWAR: A committee of the higher education department has allowed 64 colleges in the state to open new courses and streams during this academic session in order to accommodate more students. 

 The 18-member committee, headed by higher education secretary  , has given his approval for the introduction of new streams and courses in 29 educational institutions under Bhubaneswar regional directorate of education (RDE), nine institutions in   RDE and 26 in   RDE.
 
 Three new Plus III science colleges will come up in the Bhubaneswar region, while four new degree colleges with Plus III arts will be opened under Berhampur division. "Most of the colleges will start the new courses in self-financing mode from this year," said an official letter of the higher education department. 
 
 The committee has also allowed three colleges - rural institute of higher studies (RIHS) at Bhograi, DAV autonomous college at   and   autonomous college at Rayagada - to open PG courses.   will open PG in Odia and English with 16 seats each. 
 
 Similarly, DAV autonomous college will open PG in Odia, political science and chemistry with eight seats each. Rayagada autonomous college will open PG courses in commerce, physics, chemistry, mathematics, life sciences, English, economics, history and political sciences. 
 
 According to the rules of the higher education department, minimum student strength for each subject should not be less than 32. The respective RDEs will examine the student strength and report it to the department. 
 
 This apart, the department has also decided to increase seats of different colleges of the state. It is seen that students face problem in getting a seat in colleges due to lack of departments or courses or less number of seats.
