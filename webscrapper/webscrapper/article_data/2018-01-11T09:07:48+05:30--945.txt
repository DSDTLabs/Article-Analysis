CHANDIGARH: The   social welfare department is preparing a proposal for having a budget in the 2018-19 financial year for the recently-formed transgender welfare board, a top official has confirmed to The Times of India.

 The department will send the proposal to the   administration for the final nod. UT social welfare director Nishu   said the department was trying to ensure that they cover funds for all activities of the board. “Budget demand will include money for recruiting staff, organising seminars and workshops to raise awareness, and holding the annual pride walk,” Singhal said.
 
 She said the requirement for a budget arose in the first meeting of the  . “During discussions, it was pointed out that money would be needed for the board’s activities,” she added.
 
 She said it was proposed during the meeting that even though staff of the social welfare department was taking care of the requirement of transgenders in the past, they felt the need for additional staff as workload increased after the board’s formation.
 
 During the meeting, members of the board suggested that funds were required for operating the board and a proposal was unanimously approved for seeking finances from the administration. They suggested that a shelter was required for transgenders who had been disowned by families.
