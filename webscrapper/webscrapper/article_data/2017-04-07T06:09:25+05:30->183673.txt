HYDERABAD: With at least 18 confirmed deaths of babies - barely a few hours to a few days old - in and around the city along with some cases reported from  , the AP   has demanded that the government immediately revive the   in the state. 

 The NGO was reacting to the case in which a young woman allegedly drowned her newborn boy in a bucket of water on Sunday night in Gachibowli. In many such cases, the babies are either abandoned or killed by their mothers for various reasons. "The most common reason is fear of retribution by families in the event of   or when for some reason, the parents decide that the baby is a burden," Achyuta Rao, a member of the Sangham, said.
 
 He also said that though the police register cases if such incidents come to light, they are rarely pursued. 
 
 "The government must go back to installing cradles at government hospitals, primary health centres, anganwadi centres, Shishu Vihars and other units deemed appropriate by the   and child welfare department," he added.
 
 "Mothers can leave their babies in the cradles and that can save the lives of many newborns. Women can maintain their anonymity and can at least live with the hope that their babies will be taken care of. There are nearly 11,500 applications for adoption from childless couples," he said.
