AMRITSAR: While various Sikh bodies across the world have condemned the attack on preacher Amrik Singh Chandigarh in a gurdwara in the UK, Sikh seminary   has approached the   for action against him for alleged anti-Gurmat propagation.

 American Sikh Council secretary general Davinder Singh told TOI on Friday, “This kind of uncouth behaviour by Sikhs inside a gurdwara is completely unacceptable and we condemn it in the strongest terms. There is no excuse for this type of conduct regardless of differences in interpretations of Sikh doctrine or history. It it goes against the basic tenets of Sikh faith as practiced by the Sikh Gurus who laid down their lives in defense of the right of others to freely practice their faith.”
 
 Amrik was allegedly attacked during his visit to Sri Guru Singh Sabha Gurdwara, Southall, on May 8. His   was also knocked off his head.
 
 Lead activist of UK-based Kesri Lehar Jagdeesh Singh said the attack on Amrik, especially when Sikhs worldwide were attempting to restore the pride of turban through various forums and activities, called for action on the horrid underbelly of ideological, social and religious facisim.
 
 American Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee coordinator Pritpal Singh said if any religious groups had any kind of differences then they should resolve the same through a dialogue and not in a belligerent manner.
 
 Damdami Taksal spokesperson Sarchan Singh said he had given a representation to Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh, seeking religious action against Amrik. He alleged that Amrik’s preachings were causing confusion in Panth and it had to be stopped.
 
 Jathedar Gurbachan Singh said the matter would be deliberated in the ensuing meeting of Sikh high priests.
