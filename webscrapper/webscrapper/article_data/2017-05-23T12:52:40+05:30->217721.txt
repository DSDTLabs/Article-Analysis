MUMBAI: A  , which had managed to find its way to the 16th floor of a  , was rescued by   on Monday — two days after it had climbed up. 

 On Sunday evening, the kitten was sitting on a concrete ledge and mewing away when residents of the   called for help.
 
 Prakash Tilia, who lives on the 18th floor, said that the feline was first spotted on the 11th floor on Saturday. “Nobody knows how the kitten landed there. We tried coaxing it to move lower, but it kept climbing up. By Monday morning, she was on the 16th floor, mewing away loudly… Maybe she was hungry and scared,” said Tilia, who contacted volunteers from 'In Defence of Animals' to help rescue the kitten.
 
 On Monday morning, there was much excitement in the building when firemen came to rescue the kitten. While residents of the building tried to herd the kitten towards safety with a stick, a resident got some dried fish and gave it to the firemen who managed to lure the famished kitten towards the common passage.
 
 The fish-and-stick approach worked very well, said an official from  . “The kitten was drawn to the smell of the dried fish. It kept inches towards us, step by step,” said assistant station officer Sandeep Jadhav. When it was within reach, the firemen gently scooped her up and brought her to safety.
 
 Had this trick not worked, the alternative plan was that a fireman, with harness strapped to the waist, would go to the ledge and rescue the kitten.
 
 As the drama unfolded, a 9-year-old resident of the building watched with bated breath. Aarush Unkule, who pets stray cats and dogs in the building compound, said: “I was very scared the kitty would fall and kept praying for her to be safe. The firemen and god saved her.”
