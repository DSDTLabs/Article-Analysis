GUWAHATI: Award-winning actor   has engaged himself in promoting   of the state across the country. Taking part in the two-day   here in the city, the   said the situation has improved much over the years, something which needs to be told to people. 

 "The Dimasa people are one of the gentlest people I have come across. They are wonderful people. My connection to Dima Hasao has been very old. As a child I used to visit the place and have always been mesmerized by its breathtaking beauty," Banerjee told TOI on Sunday, while sipping Judima, a local rice beer.
 
 The Shillong-schooled Banerjee also spoke of being a fan of the traditional cuisine of the Dimasas. "Around four years ago I was invited by the council to be their ambassador, which I happily agreed to do. They have wonderful cuisine, which includes a fantastic rice beer. They have plenty of fermented fish dishes," said Banerjee, who has been associated with the region for the last 65 years.
 
 "My heart belongs to the Dimasa people and to the people of the northeast. Whenever I go to deliver lectures in IAS academies, colleges and schools, I always try to bring in the northeast. It may be the bamboo of Mizoram or the various beautiful tribal cultures of Misings or Bodos. See, today there is a culture of violence everywhere and the culture of moral value has degenerated. On the contrary, lot of tribal people like Dimasas represent moral values. They might be at war but they are not violent. They are innocent and simple," Banerjee added.
