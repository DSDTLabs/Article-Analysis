NEW DELHI: A 45-year-old doctor was allegedly thrashed by a group of men in yet another incident of road rage in south Delhi’s Malviya Nagar. The incident was reported on Tuesday night when the victim was returning home after work and accidently brushed past another  .

 The man told TOI that he had stopped at a market close to his house to buy a few household items. While leaving, his Hyundai Getz brushed past another car, the owner of which was standing outside with two friends.
 
 “I was leaving the parking when the three came up to me and asked me to pull the windows down. When I did so, one man, who had a baseball bat, accused me of hitting his car from behind. I moved my car ahead as he would have hit me right away,” said Dr Asif, the victim. 
 
 Asif said that he tried to go to a nearby police post. “However, as soon as I started to move, the men started shouting that I had threatened to kill them and was trying to escape.”
 
 “Hearing them call out for ‘help’, over 50 people gathered around my car and I was forced to stop my car. I rolled up the windows and locked the doors. But the three men broke the window pane and pulled me out of the vehicle,” he said. The men thrashed Asif until he collapsed.
 
 A local informed the police and he was rushed to a private hospital nearby, where he was treated and discharged on Wednesday evening. The man claims that the hearing in his left ear has been affected since the incident.
 
 “A case was registered and the accused have been arrested for causing hurt,” said a police official.
