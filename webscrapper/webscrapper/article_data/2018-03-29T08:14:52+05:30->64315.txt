HYDERABAD: The Central Board of Secondary Education’s (CBSE) decision to re-conduct the Economics (for Class 12) and Mathematics (for Class 10) examinations, left students and parents in the city flustered. Terming the move as unfair, they said that board should not have conducted the exams on Wednesday, in the first place, when it already had a clue about the paper leak.

 “If the paper is leaked in Delhi, why should my son suffer here in Hyderabad? Why can’t the re-exam be limited to the Delhi region,” questioned  , whose son   is a Class 10 student of  . In a quirk of fate,   faced a similar situation 30 years go when she appeared for her SSC boards. “I cannot believe my son is going the same thing after so many years. The authorities must take serious measures to plug such leaks,” she said.
 
 News of the leak not only shocked students but also cutshort their celebrations.
 
 “We were actually rejoicing as the paper was very easy, when we suddenly received this message. I almost choked on my food and felt like yelling at the officials for being so negligent,” said   C, a Class 12 student.
 
 While school managements insisted that there was no paper leak in the city, some parents claimed that they had overheard students talking about the leak while waiting for their wards outside the exam centre.
 
 “I noticed a group of students coming out of the centre extremely jubilant, saying the paper was exactly the same as the one their teacher had given them to prepare. A little later, another group of students stepped out and said something on similar lines. So, I think the paper was leaked in Hyderabad as well,” said Jayanthi R, parent of a Class 10 student.
 
 Speaking to TOI, school principals said that they have sent out a message to students about the re-exam. They, however, maintained that except for the circular posted on the CBSE website, they are yet to receive any final confirmation from the Chennai regional office about the issue.
