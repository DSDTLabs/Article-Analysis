COLVA: In December 2016,   ( ), under its   cell, launched a unique and an ambitious project in a bid to bring about a change in the mindset of students on garbage handling. On the other hand, it was a two-pronged strategy to make adults aware about disposal and segregation of waste.

 The programme, which was put into action last year, will end in February and has, so far, received a tremendous response from 11 schools and its students. Students have brought hundreds of kilogrammes of dry waste to their schools and the waste management cell has picked it up from the selected schools and sent it for baling.
 
 “The basic idea behind launching this programme is that when a child is involved, every family member gets involved and thus, the awareness of segregation of waste will reach maximum households,” said MMC chairperson Babita Prabhudessai. She told TOI that the council had funds under   and she wanted to experiment with the idea of involving children ‘as they are the future of the country’.
