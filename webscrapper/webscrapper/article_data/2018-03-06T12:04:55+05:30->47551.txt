Actor   said his upcoming film   is very quirky and a different comedy. Asked whether he has become 'mental' in the film, Rajkummar said: "I am very mental and from April onwards, I will entirely become mental. People are asking me that 'Mental Hai Kya'? So now I feel '#MentalHaiKya' will trend."

  
  
 Rajkummar will be seen with actress   again in 'Mental Hai Kya' after starring in the 2014 hit movie 'Queen'. "It's an amazing script as it is very quirky and different comedy. Kangana is such a powerhouse performer and we are coming together after   along with   (producer) so it's going to be lot of fun."
 
 He shared the film's poster on Monday on his social media accounts and within a short period it received very positive response from the audience. Asked about the other cast in 'Mental Hai Kya', he said, "As of now, me and Kangana are there in the film and to see who all are there in the film, audience have to watch the movie".

 Does Rajkummar keep a count of films he does in a year?
 
  "I don't keep a count. I think media will tell me how many films I have done in 2018 same as they did in 2017. So, let's see how it goes but I don't really keep a count. I love doing interesting work." 'Mental Hai Kya' has been written by Kanika Dhillon and will be helmed by National award-winning director  .
