PANAJI: The river navigation department ( ) will add three new ferries to its fleet. Malar, Agapur and   will replace three of the state’s oldest ferries, one of which was manufactured in 1961, the year of Goa’s liberation.

 “Two new   boats are ready and one more will be in the coming week. We are waiting for the handover by the manufacturer. Once this happens, the ferries will be launched and their operations will begin immediately,” an RND official told TOI. Built by Dempo Engineering Shipyard Limited, the due date for the handing over of the ferries is April 14.
 
 One of the ferries may operate on the   route while the other will be along the busy Panaji-Betim route. The third ferry is likely to ply along the Old Goa-Divar route. 
 
 TOI had reported on March 31, 2017, that the oldest surviving ferry, Pomburpa, would be condemned along with two others—Kerim and  , both manufactured in 1997. Though these ferries are 30 years younger than Pomburpa, the need for costly repairs urged RND to condemn them before time. “Major steel replacement is required for the two ferries, the cost of which is over 50% of the price of a new one. Instead of spending a whopping sum on repairs, it is better to replace them,” sources said.
