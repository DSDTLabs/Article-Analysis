MUMBAI: After months of negotiations,   has acquired on-demand logistics startup   in an all-stock deal as the Gurgaon-based food discovery and ordering company looks to build its own delivery fleet. The transaction is estimated to have valued Runnr, which is the combined entity of   and Roadrunnr, at $40 million, sources close to the matter said. 

  Tinyowl, which was a food ordering app competing with Zomato, and Runnr were two of the most well funded on-demand startups in 2015, having collectively raised more than $50 million from investors like Sequoia Capital, Nexus Venture Partners and Matrix Partners. 
 
  TOI reported first about Runnr holding talks with Zomato and UberEATS for a sale on May 15, followed by another report saying Zomato was closing the acquisition in its June 6 edition. The deal values Zomato at $800 million, as we reported then. 
 
  While announcing the acquisition on Wednesday, Zomato founder & CEO Deepinder Goyal wrote in a blog post, "I'm very excited to share, that beginning today, you will see our team in their red Zomato T-shirts delivering food to you. We've been adding to our Runnr team steadily over the past week; it is already 1,500 strong, and growing by the day." 
 
 Goyal said Runnr will continue to function as an independent logistics company (owned by Zomato) offering logistical services to players other than Zomato like pharma, grocery and e-commerce.
