Trichy: The sudden bursts of rain amidst scorching summer in Trichy over the past couple of weeks could result in people contracting viral and  , warned doctors.

 The unpredictable weather conditions can aggravate certain existing health issues too. With these potential risks, people have been asked to be careful, especially during the pre-onset of monsoon.
 
 Changes in the weather, especially unexpected rainfall during summer, can lead to the growth of infectious agents, according to city-based neurologist Dr M A Aleem. “Since this change can cause water contamination, there could be a breakout of water-borne diseases,” he warned.
 
 The neurologist also added that people with existing health issues should be careful during times like this. “Over the past few days, several people with migraine came to me saying that their headache frequency had increased. People with asthma and epilepsy can also experience such aggravation,” he told TOI. Aleem suggested people to wear dust masks whenever they experience unpredictable weather conditions.
 
 On the other hand, dean at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) Dr G Anitha said that rainfall during summer doesn’t mean that summer-related diseases would go away. “It is very possible to get skin diseases like miliaria rubra and fungal infections,” she said.
 
 The risk of people contracting dengue or viral fever is also possible due to water stagnation. Hence doctors said that people should make sure of the overall hygiene of their localities.
 
 Apart from this, following simple diet routine by including more fruits and vegetables is very essential. “I would urge people to stop eating at roadside shops for some time,” Anitha added.
