MUMBAI: To ensure that there are no mistakes in scores of SSC and   students in internal exams and what appears on marksheets, examiners will have to feed scores in optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets for the upcoming board exams.

 Ahead of the board's theory papers, teachers hold practical and oral exams for class X and XII students. These exams make up for 20 marks in a subject. Until now, teachers would write the marks on a list provided by the board which would be added to the theory marks. However, in the past there have been cases where marks were wrongly entered in the system.
 
 From this board exam, examiners will be given OMR sheets where they will highlight students marksin addition to writing it. “The OMR sheet will have two additional columns in which numbers from zero to nine will be printed. The examiners will have to highlight marks scored,“ said Dattatray Jagtap, chairperson of the board's Mumbai division. The sheets will be scanned to process data in the system.
 
 Teachers said the change will bring more clarity. “Marking the scores on OMR definitely will be clearer,“ said Prashant Redij, an SSC examiner.
