COLVA: The BJP has swept all four constituencies in the Mormugao taluka. This was no mean feat, as it had to overcome dissent within the party in Vasco, while in Dabolim, former Congressman Mauvin Godinho not only had to woo voters, but also overcome the MGP hurdle to retain the seat. In Cortalim, Alina Saldanha was facing the electoral battle for the first time, while power minister Milind Naik was fighting the anti-incumbency wave in Mormugao.

 Congress’ Sankalp Amonkar blamed his defeat (by 140 votes) in Mormugao on election officials as they refused his application for re-counting of VVPAT slips. 
 
 In Vasco, BJP’s sitting MLA Carlos Almeida managed to retain his seat by drawing 8,765 votes. Almeida said the margin could have improved had he not faced challenges within the party, while thanking his voters who stood by him. In Dabolim, former Congressman Godinho, who polled 7,234 votes, said he was humbled by the support he received from the youth and women. 
 
 MGP’s Premanand Nanoskar said money played a key role and suspected manipulation of EVMs. “How can a Congress man join BJP and win is a surprise,” he wondered. 
 
 In Cortalim, Saldanha, who was elected unopposed in 2012 following her husband’s death, won by 518 votes. She said she would now be able to complete the work that remained unfinished because of paucity of funds.
