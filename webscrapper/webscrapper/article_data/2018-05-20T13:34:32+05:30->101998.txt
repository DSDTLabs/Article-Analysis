TIRUNELVELI: A special police team has been formed to nab the miscreants behind audio recordings threatening to kill the superintendent of police of   district, P Ve Arunsakthikumar, which have been doing the rounds on social media. The anonymous sender clearly states that the threat is aimed at the police in general and to the SP due to the crackdown on anti-social elements.

 The four recordings, that run into 55 seconds, include one spanning 22 seconds and three others of 11 seconds each, giving an impression that it could have been recorded on WhatsApp. The speaker attacks the police for allegedly breaking the legs of his mates due to the inability to get them convicted. Raining abuses, he also says that they have murdered people escorted by the police as well as a number of police personnel too in the past. “We can even kill the SP and the CM,” he adds. Though the person claimed that the messages were recorded in February, police strongly believe that they were under circulation for not more than a day or two. Police sources suspect that the caller could be a sympathiser of history-sheeter Rocket Raja of Tirunelveli who was arrested by   earlier this month and also brought to Tirunelveli for his alleged role in the murder of a college faculty member. “A special team has been formed to nab the person who is yet to be identified. We have got a number from which the recordings were circulated and are trying to find if he has shared it,” said SP Arunsakthikumar. tnn
