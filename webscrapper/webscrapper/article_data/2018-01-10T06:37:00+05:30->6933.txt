AHMEDABAD: Dr Brijesh Patel, whose dentistry clinic is adjacent to the provision store, said he had frequent run-ins with Chaudhary family over their living in the commercial premises. “I had warned them frequently that they were causing danger to themselves and others, but they did not pay any heed. In a letter to the municipal commissioner dated April 18, 2017, the issue of illegal residence was also mentioned,” he said, adding that nobody listened to his repeated pleas, leading to the incident.

 The letter, written by the government-appointed administrator S S Cholkar, in scathing language states that Shop No. 6, where the provision store was located, was used as residence by the family illegally. When they were confronted, they refused to budge and dared the authorities to take action. They also had illegal an sewerage connection causing health and sanitation issues, it mentioned. The letter also highlighted the illegal construction by a shopkeeper which had completely covered the fire system including the pipe, valve and hose, which has to be used for emergencies. Other shops were also mentioned as for encroachments, becoming regular haunts for anti-social elements and the use of drinking water for washing vehicles. No action was initiated by either the AMC or local police, and Cholkar mentions that she was threatened when she tried to take up the issues with the authorities.
