Chandigarh: Corruption-accused income-tax (IT) officer Rakesh Jain and his wife, Suneet, collected   worth Rs 1.77 crore in cash and gold through “unethical means”, a chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has revealed.

 A copy of this chargesheet is going to be handed to Jain on the next date of hearing of the case, Wednesday. The ED has filed this chargesheet in the court of district and sessions judge Balbir Singh, in connection with a money-laundering case against Jain, registered under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.
 
 Jain was arrested from his home in Sector 22 with a bribe of Rs 50,000 on February 5, 2013. While CBI has already filed a chargesheet in a special CBI court against Jain, the ED is investigating into the money-laundering aspect of the case.
 
 Running into 122 pages, the chargesheet against the husband-wife duo includes 19 witnesses. Initially, the ED had made Jain’s father and mother accused in the case, but their names were deleted after investigations. The charges are likely to be framed on Wednesday too.
 
 An income tax officer with Chandigarh branch, Jain was arrested red-handed while accepting a bribe of Rs 50,000 from a local businessman on February 6, 2013. Jain was arrested from inside his house and CBI sleuths recovered the bribe amount from his possession.
 
 The trap was laid on a complaint by businessman Ashok Arora. Arora, a resident of Sector 20, owned a real-estate firm in Sector 22 and was served a notice by the income-tax department. On approaching the income-tax office, Arora met Jain, who offered to sort out the matter for a bribe of Rs 3.5 lakh. The deal was struck at Rs 2.5 lakh.
 
 Arora then approached the CBI and a trap was laid. On the day of arrest, Arora went to Jain's residence to pay the first instalment of Rs 50,000 and Jain was caught red-handed by the CBI. CBI is also in possession of a telephonic conversation that Aroa had with Jain and recorded it in his phone
 
 At the time of raid, CBI had recovered a brick of gold weighing 1 kg, in addition to gold coins and jewellery weighing 500 gm and worth Rs 15 lakh from Jain’s locker in the Sector 17 branch of Bank of Baroda and another locker in the Sector 22 branch of the State Bank of Patiala.
