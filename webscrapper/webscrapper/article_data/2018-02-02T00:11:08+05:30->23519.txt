Pune: The Sahakarnagar police has booked a serving woman police constable and two retired policemen for misappropriating and   23 motorcycles, 22 cell phones and a laptop,total worth Rs 11.13 lakh, from the police station’s seized property room since 2004.

 The two-wheelers, cell phones and the laptop were part of the seized property that was kept in the `muddemal’ (seized property) room of the police 
 
 The incident came to light during an annual audit of the police station’s seized property room.
 
 An enquiry was initiated and it was revealed that the woman constable and her two former colleagues, who were responsible for maintaining the seized property at different points in time, made changes in the register of the police station to show less number of ‘seized properties’ in the room.
 
 The `muddemal’ room in each police station is managed by the city courts as the property is seized on the directions of the court. 
 
 The property is taken out of the room only after receiving directions from the court. No policemen, including the senior police officers, are allowed to touch the property without the court’s permission.
 
 However in last 17 years, the three suspects, who were responsible for maintenance of the room, took out 23 motorcycles --- which were either seized by the police in different offences or were found deserted on road --- 22 seized mobile phones, some cash, and a laptop.
 
 Police inspector Appasaheb Waghmale of Sahakarnagar Police Station lodged a complaint of cheating and misappropriation against the two retired and a serving constable.
 
 In 2012, two silver bricks were found missing from the muddemal room of Swargate Police Station. Before a complaint could be lodged, two constables, who manned the room, committed suicide at their residences. 
 
 The bricks were seized by the Khadak Police Station but were kept at the muddemal room of Swargate Police Station.
