If you thought star kids have an advantage of discussing scripts with their family members,   says that he has never encouraged that as he always wanted to be independent when it comes to choosing his films. He says, “Most of the films that I did early in my career were with Appa’s combination. So, obviously both of us got narrations from the respective directors. Once the narration is done, we would discuss the script and then take it up. But if I am doing a subject that only has me in the lead, I don’t discuss scripts with my father before I sign a film. I have done a couple of films and I know by now what works for me and what doesn’t. Of course, my family is there to help me whenever I need them and I do ask them for suggestions if I am doubtful about a film. But eventually, the call whether I should do the film or not would be mine.” The actor has   ready for release and will begin shooting the second schedule of   in the coming weeks.
