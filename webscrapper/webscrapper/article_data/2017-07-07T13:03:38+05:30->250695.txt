KOLKATA: Designer   woke up to the news of the arrest of actor  . Reacting to the news, Das said, “I still have faith in the judiciary system. It’s her birthday on July 12. She will now rest in peace.”

 Said the designer, “After the accident, all the facts started coming out. We saw how   was reacting and moving around freely as if he was challenging the system. It was quite demoralizing for all those who believed in country's law & order and judicial system to see all that happening right in front of public eye. I think finally Sonika’s parents will be able to sleep a bit at night.”
 
 Meanwhile, Vikram’s friends have insisted that the actor had always maintained that he was not intoxicated. They have pointed out that there is a difference between social drinking and intoxication. They have maintained that this is an accident that could have taken the life of Vikram too. Unfortunately, it was   who lost her life. To counter the argument of Vikram’s friends, Das said, “It is even worse if one has to accept that rash driving led to someone’s death. I think, he would have got lesser of a sentence if he would have claimed to be drunk. It says a lot about the kind of person Vikram is.”
 
 Das also added that it’s important for everyone to take a lesson from such an incident. “Sadly, with a loss of life we had to learn this lesson. Nevertheless, Sonika’s parents are to launch the ‘27 foundation’ which will be working on area awareness Designated Driver Initiative. Vikram’s arrest just indicates the fact that we would like the truth to come out which has been hurriedly buried. His arrest only makes us believe that there must have been more than conclusive evidences to let him roam around on a bail than to arrest him. Now, we just hope that the judiciary takes its own course. He has to prove his innocence. So that is what we all were hoping. It's not a revenge we are looking for. It is justice that we seek!” he concluded.
