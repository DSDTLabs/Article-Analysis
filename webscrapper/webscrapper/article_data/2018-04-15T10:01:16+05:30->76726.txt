BENGALURU: Despite his best efforts to woo  , chief ministerial candidate and BJP state president   was at the receiving end of questions on Union minister and   MP  's statement about changing the Constitution.

 
 On Saturday, on the occasion of the 127th birth anniversary of B R Ambedkar, Yeddyurappa had breakfast at a Dalit household in Mylanahalli village of Nelamangala taluk.
 
 This time he left no room for speculation about "outside food" being served and allowed cameras to capture him and his entourage relishing the 'uppitu' and 'bonda' served by Maruti and his family. Around 11.30am, he addressed a gathering at the village. A member of the audience asked how BJP members could take an oath on the basis of the Constitution prepared by Ambedkar and make statements about changing it. A miffed Yeddyurappa tried to assuage the questioner: "I admit the statement was wrong. No person can tolerate changing of the Constitution by its architect Ambedkar. On the direction of PM Narendra Modi, Hegde has already apologised for the statement."
 
 Later, Yeddyurappa hosted lunch for safai karmacharis at his home in Dollars' Colony. In 2017, Yeddyurappa had organised a similar lunch for Dalit families at his residence.
 
 At the BJP head office, the party faced some embarrassment when MLC and senior leader Ramachandra Gowda caused a ruckus over not being given a chair on the dais during Ambedkar Jayanthi celebrations. He was mollified and given a chair in the front row on the dais, along with Karnataka in-charge Muralidhar Rao and Union minister Prakash Javadekar.
 
 In Delhi, CM Siddaramaiah paid his respects to Ambedkar at Karnataka Bhavan. JD(S) state chief HD Kumaraswamy garlanded an Ambedkar statue in Mysuru.
