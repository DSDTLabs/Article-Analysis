 VIJAYAWADA: The vehicle strength of   police is one of the lowest in southern India. The state police department has 7,729 vehicles, which is slightly better than   with 7,419 vehicles.   tops the list of southern states with 15,926 vehicles followed by   with 12,013 vehicles and   with 9,579 vehicles as of January 2016. 
 
 Nationwide data of all states suggests that the southern states provide better mobility to their police personnel. While the national average of vehicles per 100 police personnel is at 7.69, southern states have an average of 12.55 vehicles per every 100 police personnel.
 
 AP has 13.06 vehicles per 100 police personnel while Telangana has 14.85. 
 
 Bihar recorded the least number of vehicles in the country with 0.74 vehicles per 100 policemen followed by Uttar Pradesh with 3.7 vehicles and Himachal Pradesh with 5.46 vehicles.   has 23.23 vehicles per 100 policemen followed by Lakshadweep 15.17 vehicles and Telangana with 14.85 vehicles.
 
 Mobility is measured by the ability to move an entire police department in one go. As the mobility of police personnel is directly related to overall performance, better transport facilities are vital.
 
 Vehicles needed for police mobility were divided into four categories: Heavy, medium, light and two-wheelers. Depending on specific local needs, some states procured special purpose vehicles like riot-control vehicles, mine- proof vehicles and mobile forensic vehicles.
 
 A major chunk of the police vehicles consist of heavy, medium and light vehicles including trucks, troop carriers, buses, jeeps and cars. They account for 55.23% of the total police vehicles in the country. The data from 2006 indicates that the police departments in all states have focussed on increasing their fleet of vehicles over time.
