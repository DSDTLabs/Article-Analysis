Even though there were speculations about  's episode being dropped from 
  the promo of the upcoming one has come as a sigh of relief for fans of the comedian.

 Kapil Sharma is all set to grace the couch next week and can be seen at his funniest best in the promo of the show. It begins with Kapil asking Karan to switch over to Hindi as his English dictionary is limited to 700 words.
 
 Next, "The Kapil Sharma Show" star talks about Twitter and tells Karan candidly that people write anything on it and that includes him. Referring to the controversy where Kapil tweeted to the Prime Minister about corruption prevalent in the system, Karan asks him about what took over him that night. Kapil then tells him that he would like to advise people not to drink and drive, and not to drink and tweet either.
 
  
  
 Playing the Koffee quiz, Kapil is seen in a fix when Karan asks him to translate titles of English movies to Hindi. For Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Kapil funnily says there is no need to translate this one, and for Fault In Our Stars, he says, 'Shah Rukh Khan ki Galtiyan'.
 
 Considering the teaser is so entertaining and promises fun, we can't wait to see the full episode when it airs next.
 
 Koffee With Karan airs every Sunday at 9 pm on   and Star World HD.
