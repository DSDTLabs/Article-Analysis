NAGPUR: India’s contribution to   rights (IPR) is not significant given the fact that the people are either reluctant, are not aware or not willing to get patent for the inventions they made, said divisional commissioner   on Thursday.

 In his keynote address at a seminar on ‘Intellectual property right and exposition on innovations and technology 2018’, organized by   (CII) and Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Intellectual Property Management at the latter’s facility, Kumar emphasized the need for promoting new ideas. IPR lacks its roots in remote areas and hinterlands are considered to be the hotbed of inventions, he added. The topic of the seminar was ‘Fostering innovation & IP for a better tomorrow’.
 
 Kumar said there are a lot of things in Nagpur which need to be patented and the groups/tribes associated with the invention should claim their rights over it. He mentioned the famous ‘saoji’ recipe by   community while referring to IPRs in culinary creations to prevent others from copying it for economic gains.
 
 The delegates learnt about the various tools through which they could safeguard IPs in technical sessions by experts who explained the procedure to obtain patents, trademarks, graphical indications (GIs) and copyrights. During the daylong technical sessions, they also learnt how to leverage IP and achieve funds through it to gain commercial success. 
 
 Rahul Dixit, chairman of   said, “Generation and management of knowledge is crucial for the success of an enterprise and IPR is a method of legally protecting this piece of information. This knowledge need not just belong to science, technology or engineering. Dance, music and other forms of art are also included in it.”
