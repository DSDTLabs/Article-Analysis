CHENNAI:A 17-year-old boy who did part-time dubbing and voiceover work at a studio in   has, in a complaint to the Child Welfare Committee, accused his former employer of sexually misbehaving with him.

 The minor, a Class XI student, had called Childline to report that he was sexually harassed by a 45-year-old woman, who runs the dubbing studio along with her husband. He appeared before the CWC on April 24. The boy, who hails from a poor family, met the couple at an event in Kerala three years ago. The couple volunteered to sponsor his education in Chennai and made space for him to stay with them. They also paid him a stipend for working in their studio.
 
 The boy said he received “suggestive” texts and was “touched inappropriately”.
 
 
 
 
 The boy claimed problems began when the woman, a mother of two, started making sexual advances. When he spurned her advances, he was physically abused. The couple then circulated pictures of his cupboard showing boxes of condoms among the dubbing artists’ circuit, the boy alleged. Unable to bear the torture, he called his mother in Kerala for help.
 
 “We have recorded the case and transferred it to the CBCID,” said CWC member Sheila Charles Mohan. The motherson duo said they had also approached the cyber cell for help. When TOI contacted the studio owner, he said the boy was getting back at them for a complaint they had lodged with Virgumbakkam police on April  .
 
 The couple claimed he had misbehaved with their domestic help. “We took him in and offered to sponsor his education,” said the owner, whose name is being withheld as the case is under investigation. After their help complained about the boy, the couple confronted him. “He denied it. But we were suspicious. When we searched through his belongings we found wads of notes and condoms. We immediately lodged a complaint,” he said. Virgumbakkam police confirmed they had received complaints from the couple and the minor.
