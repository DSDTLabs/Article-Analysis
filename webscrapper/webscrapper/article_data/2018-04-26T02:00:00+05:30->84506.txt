PATNA: Three of the four Congress MLCs, who switched over to JD (U) recently, have found place in the party’s list of 20 star campaigners for  . The three are former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Choudhary and former Congress MLCs Dilip Kumar Choudhary and Tanveer Akhtar.

 Four Congress MLCs, including Ram Chandra Bharti, had quit the party on February 28 this year. Though all four are now with JD (U), some political analysts in the state are surprised over their inclusion in the JD (U)’s list of star campaigners for Karnataka polls, as several senior party functionaries have failed to find place in the list. 
 
 As per the list released by the JD (U) here on Wednesday, CM Nitish Kumar, party’s Bihar unit president Bashishtha Narain Singh, secretary general K C Tyagi and three general secretaries – R C P Singh, Sanjay Kumar Jha and Shyam Rajak – top the list of star campaigners. Two state ministers – Maheshwar Hazari and Jai Kumar Singh – have also found place apart from Rajya Sabha member from Bihar Kahkasha Parveen.
 
 Meanwhile, JD (U)’s Karnataka unit president Mahima J Patel on Wednesday issued second list of 12 party candidates for the assembly polls. Earlier, the party had released names of its 15 candidates. Though JD (U) is an ally of NDA, it is contesting the Karnataka polls on its own. Nitish had visited Karnataka on April 11 and formally launched his party’s campaign in the southern state.
