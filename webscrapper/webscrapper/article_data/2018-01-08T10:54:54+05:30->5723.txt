PUNE: Twenty   have alleged that a city   has denied them cashless medical treatment for the past two days under the Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme ( ).

 However, the Aditya Birla Memorial Hospital (ABMH) has denied the allegations, claiming that no patient had approached them in this time period. “We don’t have any idea (about denying facilities at hospital). If there was any emergency, we would have certainly provided facilities to the patients,”   Dubey, chief executive officer of ABMH, told TOI on Saturday. 
 
 The AMBH has signed an MoU with the ministry of defence to provide facilities under ECHS for two years. 
 
 “It was an unfortunate decision taken by the hospital. As per the terms and conditions of the MoU, if any empanelled hospital wants to stop extending facilities, it should give us a notice in advance,” a senior army officer, who is aware of the development, said. 
 
 Several city hospitals — with the exception of ABMH — had pulled out of the agreement with the Centre, citing pending bills worth crores of rupees. The officer said bills for Rs10 crore are with the government, of which “Rs4 crore worth have already been processed”. 
 
 “Since the hospital denied them services, we had to direct patients to private hospitals. Some of them had to stand in queue for treatment, which was an inconvenience,” a source said.
 
 “On Friday evening, I got a call from the hospital, informing me that they have stopped providing cashless facilities to veterans under ECHS. The ECHS centre helped me admit my wife in a private hospital. It is shocking the way they stopped their facilities; they didn’t even think about the patient. Unacceptable,” said a retired colonel, whose 57-year-old wife was to get chemotherapy treatment at ABMH on Saturday.
 
 Another patient termed the situation sad. “I am a dialysis patient and have been receiving treatment at the hospital for a few months. I (now) have to get treatment at another hospital,” the patient said.
