This budget came as a mixed bag for forest and environment sector. Amid some let-downs, big boost to solar energy became the silver lining. 

 From last year’s Rs 850 crore, the budget allocation for environment, forestry and wildlife schemes was increased to Rs 962 crore. “But it is disheartening to see that no announcement was made for schemes to tackle human-wildlife conflict across the country,” said  , former member of National Board for Wildlife.
 
 Some feel that the earmarked funds are quite less for protecting entire forest area which is 20% of India’s land mass. “Maharashtra itself has around 53 lakh hectares of forest. How can it be conserved with such a small amount?,” said  , retired member of state forest land committee.
 
 Much to the disappointment of wildlife lovers, no special budgetary provisions were made for crucial projects like tiger conservation or fighting forest fires, said president of Green Planet Society Suresh Chopane. 
 
 Meeting the increasing demands for clean and sustainable power, the budget reflects a shift towards renewable energy. With the government pushing for 20,000MW increase in solar energy output, the sector is expected to rule the roost. 
 
 “Solar industry had turned uncompetitive in the country but this move will make it competitive enough against the other polluting energy sources. This switch-over will definitely result in less carbon footprints,” said environmentalist Sudhir Paliwal. He added that cutting basic customs duty on LNG will also abate pollution. 
 
 The exemption of Basic Customs Duty (BCD) on solar-tempered glass, which is used in manufacturing solar cells and panels, is expected to bring out more affordability. “Countervailing duty on its raw materials has also been brought down to 6% from 12.5%. With this, the input cost will reduce for the manufacturers. Demand for solar will also increase. Domestic market will come at par with the international,” said solar expert Sudhir Budhe.
 
 Though the budget announces setting-up of waste-to-energy plants in Delhi and Jaipur and five others, environmentalists feel that solid waste management is a big challenge in all urban cities. “Seven plants are not sufficient for the entire country,” said  , founder of Green Vigil Foundation. 
 
 Referring to India ratifying Paris climate change agreement, Chatterjee added, “Much more was expected from the budget in terms of dealing with climate changes and other environmental challenges. Incentives should have been added for those contributing in reducing pollution.”
 
 What’s good

 * Exemption of Basic Customs Duty on solar-tempered glass, countervailing duty on its raw materials brought down to 6 % from 12.5%
 
 * Cutting basic customs duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5%
 
 * Increasing funds of Ministry of Water Resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation to Rs6887 crores
 
 * Increasing funds for Green Mission
 
 What’s bad
