Nagpur: The indefinite strike led by 700 resident doctors from   (GMCH) and Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) against assaults on doctors got heated up more after two more attacks on female doctors on Tuesday.

 All residents have applied for mass leave without putting   (MARD) in between. The resident also took out a candle march at 6pm on Tuesday with strength of about 800 to 1000 doctors taking part in it. The march began from surgery casualty building and went through Medical Square -Tukdoji Square and Super Speciality Hospital (SSH).
 
 They said that the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) had regulated norms on safety of resident doctors 10 months ago which are still not implemented due to the apathy of government. 
 
 One of the resident said, “None of these things were ever implemented. If all these rules were strictly followed, there was no chance of such large number of assaults taking place. This level of strike would never have taken place.”
 
 The residents from both GMCH and IGMCH had refused to join duty from Monday 8am. A resident said, “On that day at 12 noon, we protested outside dean chamber for about an hour but got no response from him. Till now, we haven’t been able to communicate with the dean Dr  .”
 
 On Tuesday morning, the residents finally submitted a letter to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, DMER director Dr   and Dr Niswade.
 
 Talking about the government policy framed in 2016, a resident said, “We were involved in the process of framing the policy. A team had arrived from DMER, meetings were taken, and residents were also involved. We had recommended requirement of 400 security guard including armed guards, as against the existing 110 guards. We also proposed introducing passes for patients’ relatives, limiting the entry to two relatives per patient.”
