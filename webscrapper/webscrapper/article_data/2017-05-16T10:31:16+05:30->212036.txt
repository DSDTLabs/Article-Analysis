MADHUBANI: The two-day eastern zone poets’ meet held at Darbhanga under the auspices of  , has evoked protests from locals over treatment of Angika as a   from Maithili.
 
  The meeting, which ended on Sunday, was attended by more than two dozen litterateurs of Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Assamese, Odia, Magahi, Bhojpuri, Maithili and Angika.
  
  Taking exception to the Academy move to treat  , noted Maithili scholar Ram Deo Jha, who was invited to preside over one of the sessions, skipped the event.
  
  In his letter to the organisers, Jha sought to know the reason behind treating Angika independent of Maithili. Angika is a dialect of Maithili spoken in the southeastern region of the state, he wrote, adding the poets writing in the dialect have always been gracing Maithili literary programmes.
  
  Jha also accused the Academy of lacking a clear-cut policy on language and dialect. “If Angika can be treated as a separate language, why tribal languages have been left out?” he asked while talking to this correspondent.
  
  His decision to skip the event to register his protest has been widely hailed by   from the region.
