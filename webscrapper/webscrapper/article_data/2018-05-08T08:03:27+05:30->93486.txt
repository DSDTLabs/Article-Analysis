PATIALA: College authorities of   in   held a meeting of the core committee on Monday seeking suspension of a teacher who has been accused of sending objectionable messages to a student. The authorities sprung into action after coming across a video that had gone viral in which the accused teacher, who works as a guest lecturer in the college, was thrashed and dragged by college girls and parents of the said student on Saturday. The authorities wrote to Director Public Instructions (DPI) Higher Education for his suspension and initiated the probe. 

 The student received yet another objectionable message even after lodging a complaint with the college authorities in the matter. After this, she revealed the entire episode to her parents who reached her college and nabbed the accused lecturer. She, along with her mother and other students, thrashed and dragged the accused and made him sit down on his knees and seek an apology. The girls also recorded a video and uploaded it on social media sites. 
 
 Principal of Government College for Women, Chiranjiv Kaur, said, “We received the complaint of a student of BA-II who said that the teacher used to send her objectionable text messages. The girl claimed in her complaint that the accused teacher also used to send her messages late in the night. We marked the probe after which the accused sent her a message again following which she revealed the matter to her parents. They dragged the accused out of the college and thrashed him and took him to the police station where he apologized. The accused landed in a compromise with our student and her family members in front of the police. However, we are still conducting the probe. I had written to the DPI to suspend the accused teacher who has been working with us for the past one year. We had to take this action as the video had gone viral. However, we have not seen any of the messages so far.”
