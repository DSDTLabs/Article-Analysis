Ahmedabad: City-based Vikram A Sarabhai Community Science Centre (VASCSC) organized ‘Shala Vigyan Mela’ for tribal children from January 4 to 10 in Valsad in a first such initiative. The event was organized with support from Vigyan Prasar. Officials said that from now on, it would be an annual event to explore various tribal areas in the state.

 Dilip Surkar, executive director, VASCSC, said that the initiative was aimed to create children’s interest in STEM subjects with hands-on activities. “These were children who did not have the same educational aids available easily in urban areas. Thus, our focus was to make things from locally-available material,” said Surkar. Speaking about the programme, he said, “It was not a science fair as it included competitions, do-it-yourself workshops, games, movies, night sky observation and above all, career counselling for students of primary and secondary sections.”
 
 The events took place primarily at ashram shala (residential schools) in areas such as Kaprada, Lavkar, Varvat, Khutli and Talat. tnn
