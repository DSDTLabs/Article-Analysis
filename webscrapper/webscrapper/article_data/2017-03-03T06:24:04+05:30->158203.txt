 Police sources said they have also asked SSKM, where Roy died on February 24, to provide his medical details.

Joint CP (crime)   said all proper legal steps were being followed in the probe. 
 
 Roy’s widow Ruby came back to Swasthya Bhawan on Thursday to submit a written statement on the allegations against   and spent over an hour with the enquiry committee. Sources said the probe team has started comparing the allegation and Apollo’s defence to zero in on discrepancies. 
 
 “Rupali Basu’s resignation is an eye wash to cover up the fiasco by the hospital,” said one of Roy’s relatives on Thursday.
