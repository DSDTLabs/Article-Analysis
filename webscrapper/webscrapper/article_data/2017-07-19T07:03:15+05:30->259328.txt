Patches have been identified where more greenery can be added for the herbivores and plantation is already underway,“ said a senior forest official.
 
 The census is a part of the new 10-year wildlife management plan to monitor the changes taking place inside the sanctuary . Forest officials say that camera traps and sand beds will be placed in different parts of the sanctuary that are frequented by animals.
