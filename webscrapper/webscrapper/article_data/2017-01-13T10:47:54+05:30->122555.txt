NAGPUR: ‘If a crime like rape, kidnap or an acid attack happens against a woman, the society only blames her and not the man who committed the heinous act. In this scenario it is necessary that women stand on their feet’. These thoughts have been expressed in one of the poems composed by Jyoti Asatkar.

 Usha Mishra, a well-known retired Hindi teacher, activist, social worker and a leader explained the poem during the release of 129th collection of Hindi poems ‘Mere hisse ki dhoop’ by Asatkar .
 
 The programme was held by Prakshep Publication at Neem Hall, Chitnavis Centre, Civil Lines on Thursday. 
 
 Through ‘Kehna Sunna’, Mishra said the first fight of woman is with herself. In another poem ‘Gudia’, she described that men treat women like puppets. She also threw light on the themes of other poems like ‘Roshni ke kadardan’, ‘Zindagi jeena aasan nahi’, ‘Laxman rekha’ etc.
 
 Sagar Khadiwala, senior Hindi author, said that Asatkar is a far better writer than many others he knows. 
 
 Divisional commissioner  , who released the book, said, “The book talks about women who do not receive the importance they deserve.”
