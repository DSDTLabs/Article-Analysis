Written directed and performed by  , the play   revolves around these questions – What does it mean, to be who you are? Are the pillars of today’s society built on our personal beliefs or are they predetermined by age-old doctrines set by our ancestors? Most importantly, what kind of future are we heading towards if who we are now is something that refuses to change? There is no easy way to answer questions like this. They need to be asked all the same though.

  Presented in association with Quiver Productions, Bloom is a performance piece that takes a look at gender roles through the eyes of woman, the other, in a dystopian future and where new truths can only be voiced in the potential world of the in-between.
 
  This one-woman show grows beyond the dichotomy of genders and embraces the collective through movement, text, sound and visual media.
 
  It is scheduled to take place  , on June 8 (7.30 pm and 9 pm).
