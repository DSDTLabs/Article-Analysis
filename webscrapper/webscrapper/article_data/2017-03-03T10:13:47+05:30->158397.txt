As all eyes were glued to actors   and ‘Lion’ star Sunny Pawar during the   award show, one Bollywood star seemed to have made it through the event unnoticed until now.   recently revealed she was at the show ‘in spirit’, and even tried her best to prevent the Best Picture goof up before it was made. 

 According to the actress, the presenters   and Faye Dunaway couldn’t hear her or understand her Hindi dialect, and hence went ahead and announced ‘La La Land’ as the winner over ‘Moonlight’. 
 
 Anushka took to Twitter to share her Oscar account saying, "Yeh log mujhe sun nahin paye, main toh kab se Hindi mein keh rahi thi ki naam galat likha hai (These people couldn’t hear me. I was telling them for a long time, in Hindi, that they got the name wrong).
 
 
  
 For those wondering what brought this on, it is not that the actress is still reeling over the big Oscar flub, but rather an online promotional strategy for her film ‘Phillauri’. Using ‘#ShashiWasThere’ fans have joined in to post pictures of their ‘sightings’ of Shashi – Anushka’s friendly ghost character from the film.
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 Directed by Anshai Lal and produced by Anushka Sharma, ‘Phillauri’ also stars Diljit Dosanjh. The romantic-comedy hits theatres on 24 March 2017.
