KOLKATA: At least four police personnel, including an assistant sub-inspector (ASI), were severely beaten up allegedly by a biker gang at Gopalnagar in North 24-Parganas late on Wednesday night. The attack on cops comes amidst the Bengal police taking special measures to crack on rogue bikers in the city and it’s surrounding areas.

 Around 20-30 youths on some 10 motorcycles, armed with bamboo sticks and iron rods, attacked the officers for arresting their biker friend who tried to run over a cop in a drunken state.
 
 Before that, around 12.30am, a police team, including the ASI officer Adhir Chandra Sarkar, from Gopalnagar police station had been carrying out checks on   at Dasmile, adjacent to North 24-Parganas-Nadia border check post to crack on rogue bikers. Trouble broke out when the team stopped a rogue biker. The accused youth, however, managed to make a call from his mobile before being arrested, a senior police officer said.
 
 Soon the gang appeared and started hitting Sarkar. The other cops also got beaten up in a bid to save him. “Sensing trouble, the three cops allegedly fled the spot and ran for cover leaving the ASI to fend for himself. Sarkar did manage to escape the gang but with a few broken teeth and his face covered in his own blood,” a source said. The gang also helped the accused flee from detention.
 
 The ASI was admitted to Bongaon Jiban Ratan Dhar Sub Divisional Hospital.
 
 Later, a large police team led by Bongaon SDPO, Anil Roy, arrested seven persons in this connection on Thursday. “Seven among those involved in the attack were nabbed from the Bongaon-Chakdah area and produced in the court. The raid is on to nab others,” said Bhaskar Mukherjee, SP, North 24-Parganas.
