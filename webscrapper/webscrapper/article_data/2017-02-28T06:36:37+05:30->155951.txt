AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s radio broadcasts titled   has inspired the Jamanagar-based Gujarat Ayurved University to launch ‘Tan ki Baat’ with which it hopes to promote   and vegetarianism through lectures at different places. 

 An agriculture scientist at the university, Dr Hitesh Jani, who conducts research for   and Gauchar Vikas Board, said that Tan ki Baat will elaborate on the benefits of cows to encourage people to protect the animals. Jani has also come up with ‘Medical Strike’ lecture series, which he admits has the same ring as ‘surgical strike’, which was carried out by the Indian Army against terrorists in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir last September.
 
 “Using terms like ‘Tan ki Baat’ and ‘Medical Strike’ attract people to consider the university’s programmes on gau raksha and vegetarianism,” Jani said. One of his research studies for the cow board concluded that the belching of Western cows adversely affects the ozone layer.
 
 “The title Tan ki Baat was in my mind before the PM started his Mann ki Baat,” Jani said. “At any rate, the similarity will attract people.” He said he started   lectures a year ago. 
 
 “In Medical Strike, which I launched a month ago, we make people aware about the harmful effects of allopathic medicine, and also of ayurvedic medicines if taken without proper prescription,” Jani said.
