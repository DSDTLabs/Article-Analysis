Pune: Three employees of C P Goenka School on Pune-Ahmednagar Road were arrested on Friday following a complaint lodged by the parents of a special child alleging that the institution’s authorities had “impaired their child for life”. “The employees — Kumar Madhukar Mahamunkar (30) from Yerawada, Jasinta Kumar Wilson (42) from Kharadi and Shalin Shahnawaz Adtani (32) from Kalyaninagar — were arrested under the Indian Penal Code, Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act and Juvenile Justice Act,” said sub-inspector Pravin Deshmukh of the Yerawada police. Based on the parents’ complaint, the police had registered a case against the school for alleged violation of norms related to education and care of children with learning disabilities, often described as special children. The child was admitted to the school last year in Grade I. The arrested employees will be produced before a magisterial court on Saturday. Deshmukh did not specify the individual roles played by the employees. The school principal, Rashmi Gupta, said, “We will take the legal route and ensure the three persons are released immediately. We shall be with them. One of them is a teaching staff, while the two others belong to the administration department of the school.” Gupta added, “Some people are trying to malign the image of the school. We take care of each and every student.”
