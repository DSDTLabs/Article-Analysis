Patiala: Congress leader and former Union minister   has said that Punjabis had to make a careful choice between chaos and good governance in the upcoming assembly elections.

 Interacting with professionals, businessmen, lawyers, traders and chartered accountants in Patiala, Tewari said Punjab could not afford “another spell of anarchy” after a decade of lawlessness and disorder by the Akali-BJP alliance. “We all know that Punjabis have made up their mind for change, but let us ensure that we make the right choice,” he said.
 
 Tewari cited the five years of Capt Amarinder Singh’s regime in Punjab, saying it touched all sections of society. “Be it farmers, traders, industrialists, employees or professionals, everybody was happy,” he said.
 
 He added that the period ushered in an era of progress and development in Punjab. “Punjab needs Amarinder now more than it needed him any other time. The state needs to be retrieved and redeemed from chaos, anarchy, lawlessness, and economic, financial and agrarian crisis,” he said.
