An alumnae meet was organised recently by pass-outs of a well-known girls’ school located in Cantonment. The do was attended by passouts from different parts of the globe. Feeling quite nostalgic. the girls visited their school during the day time and also went inside their classrooms to revive the good old memories. Everyone gathered for a dinner party in the evening.
