Ahmedabad: This year’s theme for World Kidney Day, which is celebrated on March 9 every year since 2006, is about linking obesity with kidney disorders, with the theme, Obesity and  : Healthy Lifestyle for Healthy Kidneys'. Various research studies have established the link between kidney ailments and obesity. Further, according to city-based medical practitioners, 50% of kidney patients are diabetics too.

 Explaining the matter further, Dr Kavita Parihar, head, department of Nephrology, Apollo Hospitals, said, “Obesity tends to create several complications including diabetes and hypertension. Moreover, unhealthy eating habits, poor sleep and stress for prolonged duration and an unhealthy lifestyle are all responsible for kidney ailments.”
 
 Even prolonged and unregulated use of painkillers can cause kidney ailments. While they are more common among males, there is no specific age-group that suffers from the disease. Recently, a 22-year-old man was referred to (Institute Of Kidney Disease And Research Centre) IKDRC, where both his kidneys were found to have failed. “He had hypertension at an early age. Currently he is undergoing dialysis and as soon as he finds a donor, we will conduct a transplant,” said Dr Veena Shah, deputy director, IKDRC. Around 1.5 lakh patients suffer from kidney ailments every year in India and only 20% of them get necessary treatment according to estimates by specialists in city.
