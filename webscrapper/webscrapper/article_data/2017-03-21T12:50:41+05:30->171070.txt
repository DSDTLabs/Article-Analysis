PATNA: Frequent fliers between   and   have reasons to rejoice as four new flights are expected to operate on the route from March 26. 

 According to   (AAI) sources, Indigo and   have proposed one flight each while   has proposed two flights on the route.
 
 The new flights are part of the summer schedule of the airlines. Since flights fail to land at Patna before 10am due to foggy conditions in winter, most airlines had cancelled or rescheduled their morning flights while finalising their winter schedule, which came into effect from December. Now that the foggy conditions are over, morning flights can operate.
 
 With the proposed additions, the number of flights operating from Patna will go up to 30. For now, the proposals have been sent for their further processing by the Director General of Civil Aviation, said the sources.
 
 Air India currently operates three flights and Indigo seven flights on the Delhi- Patna-Delhi route. The Indigoâ€™s new flight is proposed to land at Patna at 2.45pm and depart at 3.15pm. The schedule of the other three proposed flights could not be known immediately.
 
 GoAir currently operates four flights on the route. However, executives of the low-frills airlines ruled out introduction of any new flight for now though they might change the timing of their existing flights.
 
 Meanwhile, work is on for the expansion of Patna airport terminal building. The district administration recently completed mutation formalities for transfer of 11.5acres of land near the airport to AAI.
