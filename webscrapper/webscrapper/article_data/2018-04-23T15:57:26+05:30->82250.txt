VISAKHAPATNAM: The sun is beating down mercilessly on north-coastal  , with most areas registering temperatures well in excess of 40° Celsius.

 Day temperatures are surging across the region by 1-5°C and almost all places in the region are witnessing scorching temperatures.
 
 Navagam vilalge of Palakonda mandal in Srikakulam district registered a maximum of 42°C as per the 24-hour   observations from 8.31 am on Saturday till 8.30am on Sunday by the state wing weather observatory unit of AP State Development Planning Society (APSDPS).
 
 According to inputs from APSDPS, the state has registered maximum   between 40-45°C at 442 places in 13 districts including 19 in the three districts of Srikakulam (four places),   (seven places), and East Godavari (eight places).
 
 “Registering maximum temperature of 42°C in north-coastal districts is the first time in this   season. Hereafter, the temperatures levels would go up till onset of the southwest monsoon. 
 
 In future, the temperatures may cross even 45°C, mostly from the first week of May,” said a senior weatherman from the state meteorology wing.
 
 The state disaster management authority has already issued instructions to the collectors of four districts to keep a tab on the vulnerable areas and mandals in the region to prevent the problems due to the moderate and severe heat wave conditions.
