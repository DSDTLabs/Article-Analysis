KOLKATA:   Singh on Friday took his first steps around the ICU at   after his heart transplant on May 21. Though he was confident of walking on his own, the physiotherapists assisted him as they did not want to take any chances.

 
 He then asked to listen to some music and the nurses didn’t disappoint him. One of the medical staffers whipped out her cellphone and played the Bengali song “Ora hridoyer rong janena (they do not know the colour of the heart)” by Lagnajita Chakraborty. Singh could not agree more as the young nurse attending to the heart recipient translated the meaning.
 
 After the heart transplant surgery on Monday, the 39-year-old is on the way to recovery at a fast pace.
 
 “He listened to music and is in good shape and mood. He, however, continues to be under close monitoring as he is still vulnerable to infections,” said Dr Saikat Bandyopadhyay, senior consultant, cardiac anaesthesiologist and intensivist at Fortis Aanadapur.
 
 Singh’s diet has also been switched to solid food and he had rice and dal for lunch.
 
 Though visitors were still restricted, he was allowed to meet his brother.
 
 Since his constant companions are the nurses and the doctors, the medical team does not mind making special efforts to lighten up his day.
 
 “We have to initiate his physical mobility. So we made him walk on Friday and his steps were confident. He is recovering well,” said Dr K M Mandana, director, cardiothoraic and vascular surgery.
 
 The Kolkata medical team, including Mandana, Bandyopadhyay and Dr  , have taken charge of Singh after the transplant surgery — led by Dr KR Balakrishnan and Dr Suresh Rao of Fortis Malar — last Monday.
