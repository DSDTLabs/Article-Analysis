CHENNAI:   in Tamil Nadu are likely to be delayed further as a bill was introduced in the assembly to delimit   of every local body on the basis of the 2011 population census. 

 The bill was introduced by state minister for municipal administration S P Velumani in the assembly. As per the agenda, the bill will be passed on Monday itself.
 
 "Delimitation of wards in every local body with reference to the population as ascertained at the 2011 census and reservation of wards for the SC, ST and women based on the latest census figures are serious and very sensitive in nature," said Velumani in the assembly.
 
 â€œThe government has decided to constitute a   to make recommendations for carrying out delimitation of wards in every local body," said the minister.
 
 The local body elections are likely to be held only after the delimitation commission submits its report. 
 
 Sources said it would take more than six months for the commission to present its report to the government. Only after that, the elections could be held, they added.
 
 As per the original poll notification issued on September 26, 2016, elections were to be held in two phases on October 17 and 19, 2016. The matter was dragged to court by the DMK and others. The Madras high court had asked the state government to complete the process by December 31, 2016 after setting right the anomalies cited in the writ petitions by the DMK and others. Assailing the order, the state election commission filed appeals and gave an undertaking to the court that it would complete the process by May 14, 2017. However, the election was not held in May too.
 
 Cases are pending in the Madras high court and the Supreme Court with regard to the local body elections.
