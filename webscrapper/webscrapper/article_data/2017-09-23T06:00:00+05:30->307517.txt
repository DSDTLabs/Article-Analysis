All of   has been doused in the sights, sounds, and scents of the Bathukamma, quite literally.

  Glimpses of women of all ages, dressed in traditional finery making a beeline at temples greet the eye at every street corner; chants of traditional Bathukamma songs resonate across every locality and the air is filled with the sweet fragrances of the flowers of the season —   (cassia), bera (luffa), gunugu (elosia), thamara (nelumbo) gummadi (cucurbita), banthi (marigold), kanakambaram (crossandra), ramabanam (ixora) and mandhara (hibiscus) — as the ladies come out to pay floral tributes to the Mother Godess with colourful   every evening. For once, the chaotic hustle and bustle of the city seems to have been relegated to the background as the “Bathukamma Panduga” has lit up the city with its endearingly quaint, rustic charm. Here are some snapshots of the festvities from various corners of the city. All hail the Bathukamma.
