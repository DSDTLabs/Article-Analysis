COLVA: Public works department (PWD) roads division laid speedbreakers between late Friday night and early Saturday morning on the   to   stretch of road following a report in STOI on February 13, on the high number of accidents due to speeding.

 Notified speedbreakers were removed in October 2016 to facilitate smooth movement of the motorcades of world leaders and other VVIPs attending the   summit held in Benaulim and Cavelossim. But the authorities failed to re-lay the speed breakers.
 
 Due to this vehicles started using this road stretch like a racing track and it led to accidents, some of which were not even registered as those involved in the accidents would compromise among themselves.
 
 Since the speedbreakers were laid afresh in the dark, it had itâ€™s own problems. One lady rider failed to register the speedbreaker and fell from her scooter and sustained head injuries and was shifted to the hospital, the police informed. 
 
 Though the speedbreakers are in place, they are yet to be painted and the signboards warning of the same are yet to be installed. 
 
 Before publishing the news report about the rise in accidents on this stretch of road, STOI had spoken to PWD engineer  , who had said that work was pending because of election code of conduct even though the work order was issued to the contractor. On Saturday, he said that the speedbreakers would be painted soon and signages would be put up.
