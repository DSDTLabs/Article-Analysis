Vadodara: As the countdown to the forthcoming syndicate elections has begun, MSU vice-chancellor (VC) professor Parimal Vyas has appointed former dean of Faculty of Social Work professor Magan Parmar as his nominee to the syndicate body. 

 With this, Parmar, has also become ex-officio member of university’s senate body thereby making him eligible to vote in the forthcoming syndicate elections.
 
 Parmar will replace professor Ranjan Sengupta, who was so far acting as VC nominee in the outgoing syndicate body. 
 
 Interestingly, despite being VC’s nominee in the syndicate body, Sengupta, who heads the Maharaja Sayajirao Vishyavidyalay Shaikshik Sangh (MSVSS) – a teacher’s body, had remained vocal regarding some of the decisions that were taken in Vyas’ tenure. 
 
 Last year, Sengupta had publicly aired his views against the quality of discourse during the syndicate meetings which according to him has fallen to the lowest levels in the recent times. 
 
 Sengupta had also alleged that a handful of syndicate members are running the university administration according to their whims and fancies. 
 
 He was one the syndicate members who had registered their dissent when the university took the decision of barring professor Umesh Dangarwala from holding any post for a period of five years. But on the basis of majority, the university administration had not even recorded the dissent registered by the group of syndics. 
 
 With Parmar being appointed as VC nominee, the appointment of VC nominee from the non-teaching staffers is expected to be announced soon. 
 
 Elections for the 15 elected representatives in the new syndicate body will be held in the last week of this month. 
 
 While election for the one representative from amongst the head of departments will be held on February 24, elections for the rest 14 representatives will be held on February 27.
