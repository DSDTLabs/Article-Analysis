Vadodara: Two heads of Gujarat-based IT companies will represent the state in the National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM) – the national body representing technology companies. 

 While Maulik Bhansali, CEO of city-based NetWeb Software was nominated as member of the NASSCOM national SME council; Jaimin Shah, managing director of Ahmedabad-based Dev IT Limited, was appointed as chairman of the NASSCOM domestic council. 
 
 “It is for the first time that NASSCOM has set up a SME council which has been formed to focus and drive SME specific agenda and issues to help them overcome challenges, increase revenue and global footprint,” said Bhansali, vice-chairman of the Gujarat Electronics and Software Industries Association (GESIA) – the body that represents information and technology companies of Gujarat. 
 
 Shah, former president of GESIA was part of the executive committee of NASSCOM. 
 
 The national SME council has representation of members from all the NASSCOM regional councils.
 
 “In the current times, when the big players are going through turbulence, all eyes are towards SMEs as they are growing well but need support for further scalability. Gujarat with at least 1,000 IT SMEs is thriving on this front,” said Bhansali, adding that around 50 percent NASSCOM members are also SMEs. “Gujarat is now increasingly getting visibility on IT map and stage of India. We are very happy and proud of this,” he said.
