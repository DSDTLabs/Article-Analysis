LUCKNOW: Notwithstanding their CM Siddaramaiah’s ‘jungle raj’ remark for the UP CM in January, the government of   is sending a   present for Yogi Adityanath’s dream project.

 
 As many as 11 trained elephants are being sent from   and Bandipur Tiger Reserve for Dudhwa National Park. The ‘free exchange’ has been moderated by the Union ministry of environment and forests. A team of 15 mahouts (elephant rider, trainer, keeper or handler) from UP is already in the two national parks to familiarise themselves with the jumbos so that they can be transported to UP by April 20. Special arrangements are being made by   (UPSTDC) for the purpose.
 
 “The elephants will be transported in huge trucks having a set of five tyres each. The caravan of 11 trucks will also include veterinary experts and handlers from both UP and Karnataka. The road journey will take 5-7 days,” said UPSTDC managing director Akhand Pratap Singh.
 
 Dudhwa is very close to CM Yogi’s heart. Talking about the Dudhwa National Park at several platforms including the Investors’ Summit, Yogi had said: “I have seen Dudhwa. No other forest in the country is as rich. It is home to birds, deer and tigers. Animals can be sighted at every kilometre.”
 
 The CM has asked forest and tourism officials to develop the place as a world-class eco-tourism destination. The plan includes starting a heritage train like the one in some European countries and setting up ultramodern Swiss cottages for a luxury experience.
 
 Deputy director of Dudhwa National Park Mahaveer Koujlagi said, “Only two of the 11 elephants are males. The strength of elephants in the park will now be 24. They will step up our capacity to conduct rescue operations in case of man-animal conflicts and undertake better patrolling of the forest, especially in the rainy season.”
