AMARAVATI:   chief minister   on Friday said that the Centre should reconsider its recent decision on the division of assets listed under Schedules IX and X between the two Telugu state, failing which AP would have no option but to move the  . 

 The Union home ministry had said in April this year that the assets under Schedules IX and X of the AP Reorganisation Act would belong to the respective Telugu state where it was located. AP's contention is that the bulk of assets and institutions listed under the two Schedules are located in Hyderabad and as per the Centre's order it would all go to Telangana.
 
 "The Union home ministry's order goes against the SC's directive," Naidu said at a review meeting on the sharing of assets and liabilities at his chambers in the Integrated Government Complex (IGC) on Friday. 
 
 Briefing the media after the meeting, information and public relations minister   said, "The Supreme Court's directive made it clear that institutions listed under the two Schedules should be divided based on population (58% AP and 42% Telangana). So, we will appeal to the Centre to reconsider its decision. If the issue still remains unresolved, we will have no other option but to move the SC," Srinivasulu said.
 
 Srinivasulu further said that he, along with a few others, would visit New Delhi in June to request the Union government to scrap the home ministry directive.
