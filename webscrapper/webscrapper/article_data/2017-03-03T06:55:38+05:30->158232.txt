JAIPUR: To improve the performance of   in  ,   is all set to appoint principals of   as   (PEEOs) on the lines of district education officers (DEOs).

 PEEOs will be responsible for school performance and annual results. These officers will have powers to inspect schools, disburse salaries and will also have to maintain records. They should also ensure that teachers are punctual in schools.
 
 “As per the proposal, principals of 9,895 Adarsh Schools will be designated as PEEOs. A district is a very large unit. It’s not possible for a DEO to oversee the functioning of the whole district. It’s difficult even for a block elementary education officer (BEEO) to manage it,” said an official.
 
 “PEEOs will also now be the first link for improving elementary and secondary education in schools. A PEEO will be authorised to inspect all government schools in a panchayat, entitled to sanction leaves and carry out salary-related work,” added the official.
 
 “Directives for the same have been issued by the state education minister, Vasudev Devnani,” added the official.
 
 At present, the state has 9,895 Adarsh schools, with as many as 65,000 school teachers who will be monitored by these principals. Several issues will now be sorted out at the level of school principals.
 
 However, the decision has not gone down well with the principals of Adarsh Schools. They are apprehensive that the government move would reduce them into doing clerical work.
 
 “We will have to do a lot many activities of the government. Already, the situation of schools in panchayats is not that great. Managing day-to-day affairs will be tedious and may affect our own performance,” said a principal of Adarsh School.
