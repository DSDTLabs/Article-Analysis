 "The submissions have been made by both the sides. The decision on the future course of action is to be taken by the International Court of Justice.
 
 "Are they going to ask for further submissions or are we moving towards a decision-making process? That is something the ICJ is supposed to decide,"   spokesperson   said in response to a question on the status of the case.
