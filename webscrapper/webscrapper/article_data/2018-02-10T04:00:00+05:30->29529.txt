Chennai: For freelancers and early stage startups, space is no constraint in Chennai. After Karya Space, @works and CoWrks, Radiance Realty has launched its coworking space cum private office at Guindy. 

 The 11,000 square feet space has 170 seats and offers a mix of dedicated and open desks.
 
 “When I was in the US couple of years back, I had the chance to see coworking spaces and the flexibility it offered to startups. This is our effort to do the same in Chennai. We chose Guindy for multiple reasons. Besides the heavy population of corporates, anyone passing by the airport or going to OMR would pass by Guindy, making it an ideal location to be at,” said Varun Manian, founder, Radiance Realty. In addition to the services such as 24*7 access, front desk, housekeeping, in house security and high speed internet business support, there are amenities like cafés, pantry, break out zone with gaming (PS4), library. Varun Manian, founder, Radiance Realty said that multiple events will be held with thought leaders in the industry to facilitate networking. 
 
 “Rates will customised to each one’s requirement,” he added. “HQ10 is a new generation work space that is a junction of ideas, trends and meaningful interactions. conceptualized to strengthen business connections and collaborations, HQ10 is a work space that offers you a platform to nurture, grow and add value to your business,” he said. The company has 2 more spaces coming up in Guindy and Thoraipakkam, totalling 1.75 lakh sq ft. Manian expects both to be up and running by September 2018.
