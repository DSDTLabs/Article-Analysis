MUMBAI: The state government has given tablets to its drug inspectors to bring in transparency and enable more efficient inspection of  ,   and hospitals.

 Inspectors will have to log in to an app developed for the food and   administration ( ) department whenever they step into a premise for inspections. The inspection report will need to be filed through the app.
 
 “Once the report is filed, no one can change it. The inspector will also be asked to take pictures and attach them along with the report,” said state food and civil supplies minister  .
 
 Chief minister   allotted the first 100 tabs to inspectors on Tuesday. The remaining 328 inspectors will get their tabs soon.
 
 Each tab has cost Rs 9,416 and the state had spent a total of Rs 68 lakh on this project.
 
 Officials say currently the process is mired in corruption as inspectors indulge in corruption to give a favourable report. There are six lakh shops in Maharashtra which have to be inspected every year. Bapat said if the feedback on the tabs is positive, they will use the same method for food inspectors and even weights and measures inspectors.
 
 The comptroller and auditor general report tabled in legislature last week had slammed the FDA for its poor performance. The report mentioned the laxity in creating a database on food business operators. Against the estimated 16.86 lakh FBOs in the state, only 9.43 lakh or 56% were registered as of now.
 
 Another glaring revelation made by the report stated delay in recalling ‘not of standard quality’ (NSQ) drugs had resulted in public consumption of these drugs.
