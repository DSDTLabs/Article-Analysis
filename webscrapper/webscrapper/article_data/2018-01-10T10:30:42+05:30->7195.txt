PANCHKULA: A day after a leopard was found shot dead on the outskirts of   in   village in Pinjore, the wildlife department on Tuesday ruled out poaching.

 “It does not seem to be a case of poaching, but still the chief conservator will hold an inquiry with the police and conduct a door-todoor verification of weapons registered with villagers of the area. We have asked them to ascertain the weapon used to kill the wild cat. The report is to be submitted in 15 days,” said principal chief conservator forests S M Somashekar. It was the fourth death of a leopard in one-and-a-half years in Panchkula.
 
 Wildlife officers said a female leopard, probably around two years old, was found dead with a bullet injury in her chest. The leopard, in a bid to rush back to the forest after being hit, died on the way, said conservator of forests and wildlife M L  . “Preliminary inquiry has pointed out villagers use guns to shoo away wild boars to save their plantations. It seems one such villager must have shot the leopard thinking it to be a wild boar. We have termed it as a case of mistaken identity,” he said.
 
 The post-mortem revealed the leopard might have been hit from a close proximity. “The death must have occurred around 24 hours before the carcass was discovered at the village. The body of the animal had no other injury marks. If it had been a case of poaching, the killers would have extracted claws, skin or other body parts,” said Rajvanshi.
 
 Wildlife and forests officials said shooing away wild boars is a common practice in villages in Morni area as they come in groups and destroy the crop. Villagers during the nights fire shots to scare away the animals. Rajvanshi said, “According to such practice, we assume the villager must have fired at the animal thinking it to be a wild boar. But killing of a wild animal is an offence, whether knowingly or unknowingly.”
 
 The leopard was cremated at the local wildlife centre in Panchkula.
