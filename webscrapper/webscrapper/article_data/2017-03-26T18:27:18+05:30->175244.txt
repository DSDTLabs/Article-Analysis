UDUPI: Is the district administration keen to leverage   vis-a-vis  ? Yes it seems given the keen interest that minister for youth empowerment and sports   is taking to develop it into a world class facility. Located close to Malpe, the Padukere beach with its idyllic settings and clean appearance, Pramod, also the district in-charge minister said this beach will be developed into a world class beach.

 Completion of   at a cost of Rs 17 crore has provided directed connectivity for people wanting to visit Padukere beach. The   will take care of needs of this beach as well. The beach cleaning machine bought for upkeep of Malpe beach will be used at Padukere as well. There is ample scope to promote tourism by providing space for vehicle parking, toilets, bathing and change rooms for tourists.
 
 The administration also has plans to start home stay at Padukere with cooperation from locals; he said adding steps will be taken to ensure that model home stays come up in all three coastal districts of Karnataka, Udupi included. Such a measure will not only make tourism an inclusive activity for the local population, but also give them an extra source of income, he said adding the sense of local participation will also ensure better promotion of the beach.
 
 Incidentally, the bridge across the Udyavara rivulet that the minister inaugurated recently fulfilling a five-decade long demand of residents of Padukere means they now reach Malpe by traversing just one-kilometre. Hitherto, residents had to travel about 15 km by road to reach Udupi and 18 km to reach Malpe or use ferry service which posed its share of inconvenience to young and the elderly. The administration is now seriously mulling to promote the beach.
