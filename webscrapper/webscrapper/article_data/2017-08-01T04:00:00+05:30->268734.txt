Gandhinagar: According to directions from the Election Commission of India (ECI)—following a complaint by the Congress party about threats to Gujarat Congress MLAs—the Gujarat government provided police security to the families of all opposition party legislators in the state. Chief secretary J N Singh on Monday evening submitted a report to the ECI about action taken on the ECI directions. The ECI also directed the chief secretary to probe if any Congress MLAs were threatened or offered money by BJP leaders, to defect.

 Singh said, “According to the ECI’s directions, we have provided security the families of all Congress MLAs. As most of Congress MLAs are away from state, they will be provided security when they return.”
 
 “As the Congress MLAs are not available to make their statements, I have reported the status to the ECI and will act according to further directions,” Singh said.
