CHANDIGARH: The   (AAP) has written to the   chief electoral officer seeking transfer investigation of FIRs registered against Congress   assembly bypoll candidate   and Inspector Parminder Singh Bajwa out of Punjab, preferably to Chandigarh.

 In his letter on Saturday, leader of opposition   has submitted that it would be in the interest of justice if investigation of these two FIRs was shifted outside the state since the issue had turned into an ugly slug-fest. Khaira submitted it was a matter of concern for the people of Punjab though there had been no further probe into the FIR against Laddi despite grave charges of illegal mining, but the police took no time to arrest Bajwa, who registered the FIR against Laddi, at   on Friday for minor offences and that too on the complaint of a police officer.
 
 The leader of opposition also said since there are non-bailable sections of illegal mining against the   candidate and he had not secured bail from any court of law, he should have been arrested by the police that day. Khaira submitted in the letter, “The real cause of the hurried arrest of Parminder Singh Bajwa is actually an outcome of Capt Amarinder Singh’s personal hatred against the said police officer, as he dared to publicly reply to the chief minister’s charges of immoral character.”
 
 Demanding transfer of the investigation outside state, Khaira also alleged, “Needless to mention, the Punjab police is known to concoct fictitious complaints, fabricate evidence and indulge in falsely implicating people.”
