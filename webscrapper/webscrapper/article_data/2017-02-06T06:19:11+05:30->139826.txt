HYDERABAD: Workers emerging out of gutters, chest high in filth, after crawling through sewage to clear   could be a thing of the past with Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) planning to install plastic ones in   division.

 In 2016, seven people died in manhole-related incidents in the city and most of these tragedies were triggered by a failure to follow safety measures while cleaning jammed drains.
 
 “To control frequent complaints on sewer overflows and save lakhs of rupees, the water board proposed to introduce 'plastic manholes' in the city. In cities, including Mumbai and Bengaluru,   have been installed and the pro ject is a success. Now, HMWS&SB has proposed to install them on pilot project basis.For this, we have chosen operation and maintenance divisionVII (Marredpally) and decided to put in place new manholes near   in Secunderabad. Initially, we will install 15 plastic manholes on a 485-meter sewer line. Work on installing the plastic manholes will start in a couple of days,“ the HMWS&SB director-operations, G   told TOI on Sunday.
 
 Explaining the advantage of plastic manholes over tradi tional metal ones, the official said, “It is easy to clean and maintain too. Plastic manholes, which are manufactured with polyethylene, are free from damage. Also, the lifespan of a plastic manhole is nearly 50 years. Most European countries use plastic manholes. The cost of each plastic manhole is Rs 30,000, whereas conventional one costs between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,000. Though the initial cost of the plastic manholes is high, it is in durable,“ he added.
 
 A Mumbai-based firm Supreme has approached the water board to take up installation of plastic manholes. “Once the pilot project is successful, we will discuss the issue with the municipal administration and urban development (MA&UD) department and roll it out across the city,“ the water board official said.
