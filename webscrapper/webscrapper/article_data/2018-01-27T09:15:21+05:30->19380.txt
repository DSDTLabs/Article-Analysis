NEW DELHI: For weightlifter Saikhom Mirabai Chanu, Thursday brought an end to the long, excruciating wait for government recognition ever since she returned home with a silver medal from the 2014 Glasgow  . Finally, she will now be addressed as 'Padma Shri  ', a recognition she didn't expect to come her way after being denied the Arjuna award on earlier occasions. On Thursday, the government announced her name as one of the proud recipients of the  , the nation's fourth highest civilian honour.

 "My gold medal effort at the recent World Championships (in California in December) has been acknowledged. It (the government award) was long overdue and I am happy to have been chosen for the honour. I would like to dedicate this award to my coach   whose faith and determination in my abilities has turned me into a medal-winning weightlifter," Mirabai told TOI from her native village   in Manipur's Imphal East district.
 
 After Chanu won the medal at the Worlds, TOI had reported about Mirabai's long wait for awards from the government. Though Mirabai was happy with the Padma Shri, she's still waiting for the elusive Arjuna award, for which she had previously applied twice.
 
 "I haven't got the   or the Arjuna award, but have been announced as a Padma Shri recipient straightaway. It's a nice feeling, but I would be happier when I will receive the other two (Khel Ratna and Arjuna), the highest sporting honour. I am hoping to win a gold medal at the Gold Coast CWG and, may be, that would prompt the sports ministry to select me for the award," said the 22-yearold who had missed her elder sister Shaya's wedding on November 22 to continue her preparation for the Worlds.
