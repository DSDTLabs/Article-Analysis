BIJNOR: The infighting in SP does not seem to die down. A   leader here,   has now announced to join BJP. Tomar, said to be a close aide and loyalist of Shivpal Yadav, said that he will join the saffron party on Saturday along with several village heads at a public meeting.
 
  District president of gram pradhan sangathan, Kamendra Tomar belongs to Jat community and is chairman of Bhumi Vikas bank in Najibabad.
  
  After infighting in SP, Tomar was upset as his mentor Shivpal Yadav was sidelined in the party, following which he decided to switch to BJP.
  
  Talking to TOI, Tomar said, “Earlier I thought SP was the only party which can develop the state and improve the condition of the poor. This party was being run for the common people. But now it has become a party of only one family.   has sidelined all senior leaders who nurtured the party by their blood.”
  
  He further said, “I have decided to join hands with BJP and on Saturday I will switch over to BJP along with hundreds of village heads in the presence of BJP’s senior leader Upmanyu.”
  
  According to sources, Tomar is a close aide and loyalist of Shivpal and his substantial influence on Jat community may prove advantageous to BJP.
