Soon their friendship started flourishing. They met in person five months ago and married on December 28 according to Buddhist rituals.
 
  When contacted, Pallavi said, “I had met him in Nellore in Andhra Pradesh, when he came there with his company’s delegation. We immediately realized that we were made for each other.”
 
 “In most such cases, family and peer pressure prevent two persons from radically different backgrounds from marrying. But both of our families were broadminded and followers of Buddhism that united us,” said Pallavi.
 
 Pallavi said that she had decided to settle in China as Ma Hai has problems with food and weather of India. “I do not have any problems with food and weather there, as I had been to China six to seven times due to my work,” she said.
 
 When asked if Ma Hai ever tries to learn Gujarati, she said, “Yes, he tries a lot, but he is not a quick learner like me. He can just speak two sentences — Kem chho (How are you) and ‘Maja ma’ (fine).”
 
 Pallavi’s father, Nikhil Gautam, said that his family had no issue with the Chinese groom, because it was his daughter’s choice. “But, as we cannot pronounce his name, Ma Hai Guo, we call him Mahi,” he said.
