 Auto component maker,   (BFL), said on Thursday that it will take 45% stake in Pune-based   startup,   for a cash value of Rs 30 crore.

 
 This investment will be completed in three tranches over two years and values the start-up automaker at about Rs 67 crore. 
 
 Bharat Forge said that the investment will enable it to get a better grip on the overall component ecosystem in the   space. 
 
 "This will help the company to develop components/ subsystems to address the huge potential in the Indian personal mobility space... and the increasing economic viability of electric vehicles," Bharat Forge said in a statement. 
 
 The   team has developed a motorcycle, codenamed the T6X, which is capable of going 100 km on a single charge. The company has, however, been unable to commercialize the product despite showcasing it over a year ago. 
 
 In the meeting with TOI earlier, Tork's founder Kapil Shelke had said that the company had received 10 times the number of (pre) bookings than it had anticipated. Tork had begun to take online pre-bookings, free of cost. 
 
 Shelke told TOI on Thursday that the investment from BFL will help Tork invest more in R&D, getting the product and components tested and approved, get validation done and set up a place to showcase the product. 
 
 "It will help us take a few steps towards commercial launch," Shelke added. He, however, refused to disclose the launch date for the bike. 
 
 â€œ Tork is committed towards the development of the motorcycle and the technology for drive trains for electric vehicles, and we see Bharat forge as a strong partner helping us in achieving our goals," Shelke said in an official statement.
