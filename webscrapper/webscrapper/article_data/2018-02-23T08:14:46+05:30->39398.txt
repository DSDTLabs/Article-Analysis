CHENNAI: The latest trend of industrialists and billionaire-businessmen fleeing the country after committing white collar crimes and bank frauds, has prompted the   to reject the request of a sand mining scam accused for return of passport and permission to fly abroad. 

 Justice G  , turning down the plea of  , said: "The country is facing a peculiar crisis and the criminal legal system is not grown enough to secure a person who flees the country and takes shelter abroad. Under the pretext of fundamental rights, the person accused of committing grave offences like money laundering and other economic offences cannot be allowed to go abroad, unless there is a strong case to permit him to go abroad and stay away from investigation which is pending."
 
 Premkumar is a co-accused of sand mining baron   and they both figure in the case of seizure of 30kg gold and 3 crore demonetised currency, and new currency notes totalling 33 crore. He moved the high court after XI additional CBI court in Chennai refused to return his passport. 
 
 Confirming the CBI court ruling, Justice Jayachandran said the petitioner had wide contacts across the border and that, if allowed to possess his passport, could possibly flee the criminal judicial system.
 
 Making it clear that travel abroad was not an absolute right without any fetters like any other fundamental right, Justice Jayachandran said: "Travelling abroad is also subject to reasonable restrictions. Therefore, a person accused of a grave crime cannot seek the return of passport as a matter of right claiming that holding the passport is infringement of his/her fundamental right."
 
 The judge pointed out that Premkumar's case was being probed by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate from multiple dimensions and angles, including money laundering. "This court is fully satisfied that the petitioner does not really intend to go abroad for the purpose he has stated in the petition," he said.
