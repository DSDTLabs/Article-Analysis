PANAJI: The Congress and the   are in a neck-and-neck fight in Goa with each party winning 11 seats and leading in three constituencies each. For the Congress, which won just nine seats in  , it is a gain but for the BJP which had a simple majority of 21 in 2012, there is an impression that the BJP is struggling to come anywhere close to the magic number of 21 this time around.

 Interestingly, the latest entrant into Goa’s political scene,   has already won three out of the four seats that it contested in the  .
 
 The MGP has won three seats though senior party member   has lost from his constituency in Priol. NCP’s   has won Benaulim constituency for the Nationalist Congress Party.
 
 Congress had shown good momentum in the early half of counting day to lead in various seats before BJP began to trim Congress’ lead.
 
 BJP’s vote share in the state assembly elections stands at 33.4% while the Congress continues to trail with 27.5% vote share.
