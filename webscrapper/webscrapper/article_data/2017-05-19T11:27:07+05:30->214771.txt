HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Thursday directed Telangana DGP Anurag Sharma to appoint a SP-rank officer to inquire into the whereabouts of Amboji Naresh and the alleged suicide of  , the   who have been in the news after their marriage ended in tragedy.

 “Put all your efforts, trace Naresh and produce him before the court on June 1. Or else, furnish a report of the enquiry officer explaining the case as a whole and also about the efforts you had put in,“ said the bench of Justice P Naveen Rao and Justice M S K Jaiswal, which was hearing a habeas carpus petition filed by Naresh's father  . The bench pointed out the dismal performance of the police in the case with authorities not foreseeing the consequences of events that culminated in ces of events that culminated in Swathi's death hours after the bench summoned her to the court three days ago.
 
 The bench asked the state counsel if the police had questioned Swathi's father so far. It also sought to know whether the call data of the deceased had been analy sed. State counsel Sarat Kumar said the police was connecting all missing links.
 
 Counsel for the petitioner N S Arjun Kumar informed the bench that there we re doubts about whether Swathi's death was really a suicide or whether she was killed to prevent the truth from coming out.
 
 Naresh's father has lost all faith in the investigation by the local police, Kumar said. Swathi was pressured to go back to her father, he alleged. The fact that a “settlement“ took place in   shows the cops did not act fairly, he said. Since the marriage took place in Mumbai and Swathi had lodged a police complaint in Mumbai apprehending threat from her father, the counsel sought aCBI probe or a probe by a special in vestigation team with the court mo nitoring its progress. The bench re fused this request and instead ordered that a SP-rank officer be entrusted with the in vestigation and posted the matter to June 1.
