LUCKNOW: A month ahead of the investors meet in UP, the state government on Monday offered yet another sop to   by giving them the option to take power from the power distribution company of their choice. 

 The power will be wheeled to the industrial units under the 'open access system' for which the state government will set up a help desk at the UP state load dispatch centre (UPSLDC), said principal secretary (energy),  .
 
 The permission to take power from a source other than the existing distribution company will be granted by the   power transmission corporation limited and the respective discom. Industries have been seeking power under the open access system but could not do so since the process for getting clearances was tedious. 
 
 "Now, the help desk will coordinate with all concerned authorities to get the job done," said energy minister  .
 
 The open access policy, experts said, could prove to be a boon to the industries in UP which has a power crunch. 
 
 The Aditya   government has been wooing industry with various sops and had recently set up a single window clearance system.
