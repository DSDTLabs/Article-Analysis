PATNA: The   Teachersâ€™ Association ( ) served a legal notice to the State Election Commission and the Patna district election officer-cum-district magistrate on Monday in connection with the deployment of university and college teachers for urban body election duty.
 
  The legal notice pointed out the Patna high court (HC) had exempted teachers of Magadh University from performing civic body election duty in 2006. Therefore, their deployment for the election duty this year will amount to violation of the spirit of the HC judgment, said MUTA president A K  .
  
  MUTA advocate   referred to the judgments of the cases bearing numbers   7493/2011, 2011 (2), PLJR 680, 4168/2007 , 4374/2009, 5524/2009, 2009(2), PLJR 640 and CWJC 5871/2006, which exempted college teachers from performing election duty.
  
  According to MUTA sources, most of the teachers of the city- based colleges have been made patrolling magistrate by the district election officer for the civic body election to be held on June 4 and 7 next month. Though these teachers have already reported for their training, they are yet to get a final appointment letter for the duty.
  
  It is feared that the evaluation work for the Degree Part III honours examination, slated to begin in June, will be hampered if teachers go on election duty.
