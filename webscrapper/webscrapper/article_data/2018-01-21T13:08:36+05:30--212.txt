BATHINDA: A protest by employees of Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant (GNDTP), Bathinda, and members of PSEB employees’ joint forum kept   finance minister   Singh Badal away from a function at a private school, where he was called as the chief guest.

 To show Manpreet black flags as a mark of their agitation, the protesters on Saturday appeared outside the school much before the minister was scheduled to reach there.
 
 As Manpreet had to skip the function, Bathinda zone inspector general of police (IGP) M S   stepped in as the chief guest on his behalf.
 
 The employees waved black flags and raised slogans against Chhina, mistaking him for Manpreet. However, the protesters ended their protest after they came to know that it was the IGP and not the finance minister who had come to attend the function.
 
 Meanwhile, the contractual employees of GNDTP continued their protest along with their families for the 20th consecutive day, after the plant was shut down on January 1. “We will continue our agitation until the state government rolls back its decision. We are ready to make any sacrifice for this. We will continue our protest against Manpreet Badal as well,” said PSEB employees’ joint forum member Gursewak Singh.
 
 Meanwhile, former minister and   leader   went to the GNDTP employees and assured them that he would take up the matter with the chief minister.
 
 “I will soon meet chief minister   and will urge him to negotiate with the employees,” Lal said.
