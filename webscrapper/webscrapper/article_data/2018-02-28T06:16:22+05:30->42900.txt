HYDERABAD: Smoke from a luggage bag in the helicopter carrying chief minister   sent his securitymen into a tizzy on Tuesday. A security guard noticed the smoke and immediately put it out. Director-general of police M   said an inquiry has been ordered into the incident. 

  was going from Karimnagar to   in Adilabad in a helicopter after participating in a meeting of farmers when one of the officials accompanying him noticed smoke emanating from a bag. The bag was part of the luggage of the security personnel accompanying the CM. The security official immediately offloaded the bag and threw it after running about 100 metres away from the helicopter. Luckily, the helicopter had not taken off when smoke was noticed.
 
 The CM proceeded to Adilabad and later to Mancheryal where he addressed farmers and Singareni workers.
 
 The exact cause of smoke is not clear but it is suspected that the bag contained battery for a   (VHF) wireless set. Overheating of the equipment may have led to the fire. 
 
 Soon after the incident, the DGP's office clarified that there was no technical snag in the helicopter.
