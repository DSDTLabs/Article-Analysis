Vijayawada: The employees of Dr NTR University of Health Sciences ( ) staged a protest against the allocation of the university   of about Rs 168 crore for providing basic amenities to 15 government hospitals that fall under the purview of the AP Government Directorate for Medical Education.

 The government recently passed an order to use the university funds to provide basic amenities such as sewage tanks and fire safety measurements. 
 
 In a statement here, the development, funds procurement and protection committee of the university demanded revocation of the order and said that such a step would put the very survival of the university in trouble. The committee said the government should take steps to achieve the goals with which the university was established in 1986.
 
 About 120 employees took part in the agitation and submitted a memorandum to the university registrar. They said that after bifurcation, the university had to pay about 42 per cent of its funds to the university in Telangana, and left with about 320 crore university funds. If the recent order is implemented, the university would be left with only 153 crore, which would put the university in trouble, the committee said. 
 
 The committee said the university is left with only 349 colleges under its purview after bifurcation so the revenue from the colleges had come down. The government spends about Rs 6 crore on the university every year and the rest is procured by the university, they added.
