MUMBAI: The Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was framed in 2012 to ensure speedy trial of offences against children but data compiled by law ministry shows pendency of such cases is piling up with  , UP and Madhya Pradesh topping the table.

 The most number of abuse of children cases are in Maharashtra where 17,300 cases are pending trial, UP has 15,900 and Madhya Pradesh 10,950. Kerala, Odisha, Karnataka, Rajasthan, West Bengal and   have pendency of cases ranging between 3,500 and 5,000.
 
 POCSO courts are special courts for the trial of cases of crimes against children and are intended to protect minors and their victimization as there already is long pendency of other cases. There are 597 such courts across the country, almost one in every district, to ensure that the trials are completed within a year from the registration of the FIR. These courts come under the direct supervision of the high court of respective states. The high courts are responsible to monitor the working and control of POCSO courts.
 
  
 There are more than 90,205 cases pending trial across 29 states and seven Union Territories till 2016 for which data is available. A year before, the government had, however, reported total pendency of POCSO-related cases at 27,558 across the country. The significant jump in pendency is a cause of concern.
 
 Crimes against children have gone up in recent years, and so have the pendencies in the special children courts. Though HCs and states have taken various steps, including appointment of 459 special public prosecutors, 729 special juvenile police units and 597 special children courts set up in 681 districts, an efficient monitoring mechanism needs to be implemented to ensure the trials are completed in time-bound manner.
