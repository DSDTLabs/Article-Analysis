PUNE: The   (PCB) is planning a complete overhaul in its recruitment process, by bringing in external officers to draw up appointment lists.

 The PCB has 225 posts that it is trying to fill over the next few months, including nearly 50 teachers across various schools, and around 100 sanitation workers, whose absence had ‘severely crippled’ the board’s operations over the past few years, officials said. 
 
 An official said, after years of applying to the   (MoD) for a sanction to fill up these posts, it finally approved the request in February.
 
 According to initial calculations of the PCB, the payroll for the new employees is expected to run up to Rs 46 lakh per month.
 
 As per the Cantonments Act, the appointing authority is usually the chief executive officer of the board, who checks qualifications of the applicants and makes the appointments. However, officials say such an arrangement often raises questions about transparency and the suspicion of nepotism.
 
 The board’s CEO, D N Yadav, says he is planning to bring in external recruiters for the purpose, so that there is no interference in the process.
 
 “I will request the defence estate authorities in the   and in the Centre to form a committee and look at the credentials of applicants independently. They can then recommend the names to me for appointment,” Yadav said.
 
 He added that the exact number of personnel involved will depend on the authorities.
 
 “The committee can be formed of   officers from other boards or commands or by others as well, as the defence estates department may decide,” Yadav added.
