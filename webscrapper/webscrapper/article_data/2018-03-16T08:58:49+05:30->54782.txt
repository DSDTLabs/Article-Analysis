PUNE: As many as 50 cities across the globe, including 25 in India, will observe the birth   of the legendary Marathi polymath PL (PuLa) Deshpande starting on November 8.

 “A series of events will be held around the world where there is a significant number of Marathi speakers. We have tied up with expatriate Marathi organisations to promote the events,” organisers of ‘Global Pulotsav’ said at a press conference on Thursday.
 
 The organisers have also tied up with a Marathi expatriates’ organisation in the United States. “We expect a huge response abroad because of the legacy that   left, along with his enduring popularity,” Virendra Chitrav, one of the organisers, said.
 
 “PuLa received thousands of letters from his fans who loved the humour and thoughts in his writing. He made it a point to reply to most of his fans, which were extremely humorous. So, we have put a call out to the general public to give us copies of any letters that they may have received from PuLa. We plan to hold an exhibition of the letters, and also publish a book out of them,” Chitrav added.
 
 An advisory committee, comprising luminaries in the Marathi literature, will steer the festival. “We are looking to tie up with the Central and state governments to increase awareness and participation, besides the local authorities. The principal aim here is to introduce the youth to PuLa Deshpande,” Chitrav said.
 
 “A number of his books have gone out of print. We are appealing to the publishers to reprint them as we need to tell the youth about PuLa’a writings. His plays will be recreated on stage where about 500 artists will participate,” he added.
