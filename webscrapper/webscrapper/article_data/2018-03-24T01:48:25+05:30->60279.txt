GURUGRAM: The forest department is setting up a check   near   to recharge   tables of the area.

 According to the department, the construction of the 12.5-metre dam has already begun and it will not only help in recharging the groundwater but will also check rainwater run-off from the   during monsoon, which causes waterlogging in the area. 
 
 “After a detailed study of the area, we decided to construct a check dam using trees and stones here. As this is the best season for the construction, we immediately got to work. The plan is to keep some water at the foothills and avoid man-animal conflict for which ponds are also being dug up near the site,” said an official of the forest department.
 
 Sunder Singh, a villager, said, “It is a good initiative as the land will remain moist for most of the time. It will help recharge the groundwater in the area too. Also, many times during summers wild animals come out of the forest area in search of water, increasing chances of man-animal conflict. If water is available inside the forest, they would not venture out.” 
 
 Forest officials said the construction of the check dam would be completed within six to eight months.
