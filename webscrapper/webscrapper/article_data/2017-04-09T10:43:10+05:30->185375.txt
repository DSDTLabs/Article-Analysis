LUCKNOW: Waterlogging and clogged drains are the main reasons for mosquito menace in the city, said the technical advisory committee for prevention of vector-borne diseases. The committee came into being after last year's dengue outbreak. However,   is yet to pay heed and start routine de-silting of drains.

 The exercise should begin in March so that cleaning of all big and small drains and nullahs can be completed before monsoon. Choked drains breed mosquitoes and during rainfall, it leads to waterlogging. Stagnant puddles also breed mosquitoes. In a reality check, TOI spotted a mosquito breeding ground every 500 meters in almost all the congested areas of the city, most of which are a result of stagnant water in clogged drains.
 
 “The drains in my locality have been choked. One cannot cross the lanes without getting bitten by mosquitoes,“ said  , a resident of Tehseenganj.
 
 On the Munshipulia intersection, drains around Sukh complex have not been cleaned for over a year so the sludge has flown out and accummulated along the sides.
 
 Even in Gomtinagar, Indiranagar and Mahanagar, residents say de-silting has not been done for months. Additional municipal commissioner   said, “All drains will be cleaned before monsoon.“
