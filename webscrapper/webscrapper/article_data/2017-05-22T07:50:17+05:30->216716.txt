NEW DELHI: A loaf of bread weighing 180 kgs, a 14-footlong pie, a sugar cube structure made of 14,353 smaller cubes and a 'maalpua' covering an area of 32 square feet.These are not items on the menu of some kingly feast, but among a Jaipur-based professor's eight record-breaking feats that figure in the   Book of Records -the highest number of records totted by any individual.

 What's more, these “achievements“ have landed 49-year-old Manoj Srivastava a “doctorate“ from the   that claims to honour record breakers. Srivastava, working as head of the   at  's Jaipur campus, made his first world record in 2008 by creating the world's biggest piece of bread, weighing 180 kilos, which had to be picked up with the help of crane. “I had baked it in 16 ho urs. Encouraged by the success, I made the world's biggest pie in 2013 with the help of 60 students in 12 hours. The pie was 14 feet long and 6 feet wide and weighed 365 kgs,“ he told  . Srivastava, who has an MBA degree in tourism, is among 13 people who have been awarded with the “honorary doctorate“ in record breaking. In 2014, he created the cube structure. “It contained 14,353 cubes of sugar. It was five feet long and five feet wide and was made in three days with a team of 11 students,“ he said. The chef professor's fourth world record was the Greek dish 'Moussaka'. It weighed 800 kg and was 12 feet long and 6 feet wide.
