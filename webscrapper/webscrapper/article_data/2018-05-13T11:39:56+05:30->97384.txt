CHENNAI: AICC president   is set to rejig   Committee, and a new president is likely. Those in the race for the post include former Union finance minister P Chidambaram and former MLA Peter Alphonse, said sources.

 
 Rahul plans to name four working presidents as well and a campaign committee with a chief. Former presidents E V K S Elangovan, K V Thangkabalu, M   and Alphonse and Thirunavukkarasar, if removed as chief, could be working presidents. National spokesperson Khushbu may be the election campaign chief.
 
 With Karnataka assembly election over, Rahul has turned his attention to TN where the Congress’ relationship with the DMK is under strain owing to the latter gravitating towards some third front proponents.
 
 On Saturday, Thirunavukkarasar said alliance with the DMK was not permanent. “Which party aligns for lifetime? Is it a 50-year Cauvery agreement?”
 
 Elangovan and Alphonse are in the national capital where the latter met Rahul on Saturday.
 
 “Former Rajasthan chief minister and AICC general secretary Ashok Gehlot and a senior leader in Rahul’s office are holding talks with TN leaders,” said a senior leader. Changes could be effected before Rahul’s intended pilgrimage to Kailash Manasarovar.
 
 “Party high command’s thinking is that Chidambaram should be given the reins akin to the recent appointment of Kamal Nath as head of   unit,” said another leader. Chidambaram appears reluctant as the party state unit is faction-ridden, said the leader.
 
 There is concern about 25 AICC members and district presidents boycotting an executive committee meeting recently.
 
 Most of them are loyalists of Chidambaram and Elangovan. Despite “ criticism” of the government, Thirunavukkarasar’s past links with the AIADMK have been a liability.
