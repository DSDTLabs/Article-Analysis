Cleared/310 Words (Francis) Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday restrained the Dindigul Town police from arresting former state minister Natham R Viswanathan of the AIADMK till Wednesday. Justice J Nishabanu gave this interim relief to Viswanathan after she heard his petition seeking anticipatory bail in a cheating case. AIADMK youth wing deputy secretary of the Dindigul district A Sabhapathy who is also running a travel agency and a real estate firm filed a petition seeking direction to the police to register an FIR against Viswanathan and police protection to his family alleging that the former minister owed Rs 2.97 crore to him and when he had asked the money back, the former minister threatened to kill him.  Since Viswanathan is in the O Panneerselvam faction, he apprehended arrest by police, which led him to file an advance bail petition before the high court bench. On Tuesday, when the petitions filed by Sabhapathy and the former minister came up for hearing, Sabhapathy’s side said that Viswanathan was functioning as election in-charge during the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Based on his instructions, Sabhapathy who is also a businessman, lent Rs 4.97 crore to 33 people to look after election expenditure. However, the former minister reimbursed Rs 2 crore only. When Sabhapathy demanded the remaining amount, the former minister threatened him. Hence, a complaint was lodged before the Dindigul North police on February 7 last. However, there was no action on the part of the police, the counsel added. Denying this, the former minister’s side said the allegations against the former minister was false. The present complaint had been lodged against the former minister due to a split in the AIADMK. Sabhapathy wanted to reply to the former minister’s advance bail petition on Wednesday. The court accepted it and directed the police not to arrest former minister till Wednesday.
