NEW DELHI: In the internet age when information flows more freely than ever before, the Centre justified the ban on private   broadcasting news and current affairs, saying this could endanger "  and public order". 

 In an affidavit filed in the  , the government said it could not permit news content on FM as it might be misused by anti-national elements in the country and outside to propagate their agenda and radical views, posing a grave danger to the country. 
 
 It filed the response in compliance of the apex court's order which had sought explanation on why news broadcast should not be allowed on private radio stations. 
 
 The government said there is no mechanism in place to monitor content of live broadcast of all radio stations and law and order problems may arise if they transmit sensitive news.
 
  Referring to community radio stations, it said they were run by NGOs and could be used as platforms to manipulate the minds of local people. 
 
 “Broadcasting of news by these stations/channel may pose a possible security risk as there is no mechanism to monitor the contents of news bulletin of every such station. As these stations and channels are run mainly by NGO or other small organisation and private operators, several antinational or radical elements within the country can misuse it for propagating their own agenda,” it said.
 
 The government added that some radio stations also air programmes involving chats with NRIs and these may be exploited too.
