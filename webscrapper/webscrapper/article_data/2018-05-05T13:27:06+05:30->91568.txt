 has a hectic day till evening today and after that it is only family time for the  's heartthrob. "I am dubbing for Debaloy Bhattacharya's Bidai Byomkesh, where I play a double role â€” an ageing   who is 80 years old and the other one is 26 years old. I completed dubbing for the film today. It was not easy to dub for an 82 year old Byomkesh and I got a lot of help from the team at the dubbing studio," said Abir, who will be visiting halls to interact with the audience where   is running. "From evening I will be only playing with my daughter   which I enjoy the most," said the actor.
