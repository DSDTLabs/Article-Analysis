PANAJI: The Supreme Court on Friday ordered the B S Yeddyurappa government to take a floor   in the Karnataka Assembly on Saturday at 4pm. The order curtails the two-week window period given by governor Vajubhai Vala. The move follows the precedent set by Goa in March 2017.

 On March 13, 2017, state   legislature party leader Chandrakant Kavlekar filed a plea in the Supreme Court on behalf of the party challenging governor Mridula Sinha’s decision to invite BJP’s Manohar Parrikar to form the government despite Congress being the largest party in the state after elections threw up a hung assembly. 
 
 A three-judge Supreme Court bench of justices Jagdish Singh Khehar, Ranjan Gogoi and R K Agrawal on March 14, 2017, asked the Goa governor to ensure that a floor test was held on March 16, 2017.
 
 The results of the February 4 Goa assembly polls were declared on March 11. Sinha asked Parrikar to form the government after he staked claim and gave him 15 days to prove his majority on the floor of the House. The Congress had challenged the governor’s decision to give BJP the first chance to form the government. BJP had secured 13 seats as against Congress’17.
 
 The BJP moved expeditiously and forged an alliance with regional parties — MGP and GFP, with three MLAs each — and three independent legislators, even as the single largest party was still discussing possible moves. 
 
 Considering serious allegations made by the Congress about degeneration of the democratic process, the Supreme Court observed that “the instant sensitive and contentious issue raised on behalf of the petitioner, can be resolved by a simple direction, requiring the holding of a floor test at the earliest”. The court said holding of the floor test would remove all possible ambiguities and would result in giving the democratic process the required credibility.
