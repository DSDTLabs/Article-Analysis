Pune: The Khadak police on Friday night registered an offence against an unidentified man for stalking two college students and throwing some sticky substance on one of them near Rohidas Garden at Guru Nanaknagar off Shankarsheth Road around 8pm.

 A 23-year-old college student lodged a complaint against the unidentified person aged around 30 years. The suspect has been booked under section 354-A (sexual harassment), 354-D (stalking) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 An officer from the Khadak police station told TOI that the student, in her complaint, stated that on Friday around 7pm, the complainant and her friend went shopping. “While heading towards the shop, she had noticed the suspect near the garden. He was wearing a blue shirt and black trousers,” the officer said.
 
 On her way back home, the man followed them. “When she and her friend were near the garden, the student felt some fluid on her legs,” the officer said.
