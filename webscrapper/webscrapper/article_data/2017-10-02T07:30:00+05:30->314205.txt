Dharamshala: For a party grappling with intraparty wranglings in the runup to assembly elections, problems seem to be mounting for the Congress in Himachal Pradesh. 

 A Panchkula-based businessman has lodged a complaint at a local police station, alleging he was duped of Rs 10 lakh by a man posing as an agent of HP minister Sudhir Sharma, who holds the portfolio of housing, urban development and town and country planning.
 
 The FIR was lodged at Dharamshala police station on Saturday on the complaint of Ashish Walia. Walia has alleged that Kamat Attri, a resident of Chandigarh, had taken Rs 10 lakh from him as guarantee to provide a development project tender. Attri had claimed to be very close to Sharma and even produced a letterhead of the minister. Walia said he took part in the bidding, but wasn’t awarded the tender.
 
 Dharamshala station head officer (SHO) Sunil Rana said a case of forgery and cheating has been registered against the accused and teams have been sent to arrest him.
 
 Attri has denied all the charges and alleged a conspiracy against him. He said that he and Walia have known each other for some years now. He said he runs a power project in Una district of Himachal and a construction company, which is developing residential apartments in Shimla. “I never took money from him. Police have registered case against me without verifying the facts,” he said.
 
 When contacted, Sharma claimed it was attempt to tarnish his image. “Ashish Walia had met me recently, saying the accused took money from him and promised to get a government contract awarded in his favour,” he said. It was a fake letterhead and his signatures were forged, the minister claimed, adding that he had advised Walia to go to police.
