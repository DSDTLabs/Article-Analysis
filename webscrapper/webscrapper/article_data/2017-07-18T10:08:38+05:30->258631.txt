KANPUR:   on Monday   from practising in any   for life time. The   of the Bar Council received a complaint from one Deepa Shukla wherein she had alleged that advocate Verma had got himself enrolled in   after retirement on the basis of forged documents, gross misrepresentation and thus tarnished the image of advocates in the society. 

 The complainant had also filed a list of around 14 cases along with the complaint.
 
 She had also alleged that Rajaram Verma was a history-sheeter with a large number of criminal cases pending against him, and in support of her claim she had filed cuttings of newspapers depicting Verma's conduct.
 
 Verma while appearing before the disciplinary committee claimed that he had been discharged by the Bar Council in two cases. He said he retired as senior assistant registrar (first class) from IIT-Kanpur, and was also elected president of Ganga Nagar Co-operative Society. He alleged that land sharks and anti social elements had filed false cases against him as he refused to provide them plots free of cost. The complainant Deepa Shukla, who has concealed her identity, filed the complaint on false facts, Verma further alleged. 
 
 The committee after going through evidence on record observed, "On the basis of facts and circumstances of the case and the evidence, the committee is of opinion that Rajaram Verma had committed professional misconduct, misused his position and took advantage of advocacy which is against section 35 of the Advocates Act.
 
 Rajaram Verma therefore was being debarred from practising in any court of law in the country for life, the committee ruled. 
 
 It has directed to send the order to the district magistrate and other judicial authorities of the district for necessary action and compliance.
