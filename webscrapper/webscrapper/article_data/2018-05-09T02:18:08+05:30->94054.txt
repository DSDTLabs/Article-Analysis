GHAZIABAD: A 30-year-old woman and four men have been booked for allegedly attempting to murder a   card seller on Monday after he could not activate the card she had purchased from him. 

 The card seller, an 18-year-old youth identified as Shivam, has been admitted to   in Delhi after he was shot at.
 
 The crime occurred at   area in Loni around 3.30 pm on Monday where Shivam sells Idea mobile phone SIM cards from a makeshift counter on the main road. Shivam lives in Karawal Nagar in neighbouring Delhi.
 
  SP (Rural) Arvind Maurya told TOI the woman was enraged when Shivam could not explain to her the reason for the delay in getting the SIM card activated.
 
  “The main accused, Heena, had purchased a new SIM card from Shivam on Saturday but there was a delay of two days in activating it. On Monday afternoon, she reached Shivam’s kiosk along with four men. Shivam apparently could not explain the inordinate delay in activation, which enraged Heena. A quarrel ensued between her and Shivam and the men accompanying Heena joined her in a scuffle with the victim. Following this, one of the men brandished a gun and shot at Shivam. The five accused fled ,” Maurya added.
 
 An FIR under IPC section 307 (attempt to murder) was registered with Loni police station on Tuesday against Heena and her accomplices Shahnawaz, Jamshed, Mullah and Sanu. All five are on the run.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, Shivam’s relatives were not available for comment. According to police sources, Heena is engaged in drug trafficking in Loni. She reportedly procures cannabis, smack and hashish from neighbouring areas and sells them in Loni with the help of her gang members who had accompanied her to Shivam’s shop on Monday.
 
 Police are examining their records to ascertain if Heena has a criminal history.
