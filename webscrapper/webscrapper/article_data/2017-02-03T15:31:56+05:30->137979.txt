CHENNAI:   chief minister O   on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra   to instruct ministry of external affairs to secure the safe release of 25 Indian   and 119 fishing boats from Sri Lankan custody. 

 The fishermen in Sri Lankan custody include five men who set sail from Jegathapattinam fishing base in Pudukkottai district of Tamil Nadu on a mechanised boat. They were detained by the Sri Lankan navy in the early hours of Thursday. The fishermen have been taken to Kankesanthurai in   and lodged in a jail there. 
 
 “The Sri Lankan authorities continue to infringe upon the historical rights enjoyed by our fishermen to fish in their traditional waters in the Palk Bay,” the chief minister said in a letter to Modi.
 
 Panneerselvam said his government reiterated that the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) itself was sub judice. Late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had challenged the constitutional validity of the Indo-Sri Lankan agreements of 1974 and 1976 in her personal capacity, and subsequently the Tamil Nadu government impleaded itself in the case, he said.
 
 The chief minister said Sri Lanka had not released any of the fishing boats apprehended since February 2015. “With their sole means livelihood taken away, the Indian fishermen from Tamil Nadu are in a despondent state,” he said. 
 
 The boats in Sri Lankan custody are precariously berthed on the Sri Lankan shore. At a ministerial-level meeting in Colombo on January 2, the Sri Lankan government committed to consider the release of the boats. However, no action had been taken yet, he said.
 
 “I request the central government to take up this issue with the authorities of the Sri Lankan government and ensure the immediate release of the precariously berthed boats…,” Panneerselvam said.
