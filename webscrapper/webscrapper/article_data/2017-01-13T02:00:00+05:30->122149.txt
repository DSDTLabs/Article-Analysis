PATNA: A 22-year-old boy’s attempt to meet his girlfriend proved costly when a group of women tied him to a pole and rained slippers on him at Natthipur village in   district on Thursday.

 The youth, Neeraj Kumar Sharma, a resident of Dighi village, was later handed over to Korha police station. Katihar SP Siddharth Mohan Jain said the youth was moving outside a girl’s house at Natthipur village. “He was making an attempt to enter the girl’s house through a window when some women caught him,” the SP said, adding that the youth has been arrested.
 
 The youth continued to be at the receiving end for almost an hour until some male villagers intervened and asked the women to hand over him to the police. “Even the male members of the village did not muster courage to intervene for an hour when the women were in action,” said a police officer.
