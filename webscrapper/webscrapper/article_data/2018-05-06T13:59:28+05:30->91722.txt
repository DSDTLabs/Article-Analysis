KRISHNAGIRI: A major fire incident was averted after the driver of a fuel tanker stopped the vehicle soon after he detected fire in its engine and sprang into action to put out the flames on   national highway near Hosur here on Saturday.

 While no casualty was reported, traffic on the stretch, however, came to a standstill for nearly three hours.
 
 The incident took place when the tanker with 20 litres fuel was on its way to a petrol bunk at   at Hosur from Salem. When it neared Shoolagiri, its driver M Sakthivel detected fire in the engine and stopped the vehicle on roadside. When his attempts to put out the flames with a fire extinguisher failed, he sought the help of employees of a nearby petrol bunk.
 
 They tried to bring the fire under the control with the help of six fire extinguishers, but in vain. The fire soon spread to the first of the four fuel carrying segments of the tanker.
 
 Meanwhile, the public alerted the police and fire service officials. Immediately, fire tenders from Hosur and Rayakottai reached the spot and doused the fire within an hour.
 
 “A major fire mishap was averted due to the timely intervention of the driver,” an official said, adding that the engine and the first feul carrying segment of the truck were completely damaged in the fire.
 
 Thousands of commuters were stranded on the highway, as the traffic came to a standstill for at least three hours due to the fire incident.
