GURUGRAM:   on Monday wrote to chief minister   and Prime Minister Narender Modi, demanding justice for a four-month-old monkey, who received serious injuries during a   catching exercise conducted by workers of an agency hired by the MCG.

 Reportedly, the agency workers on Saturday administered drugs through bananas to a group of monkeys in Valley View Estate, a residential colony on Gurugram-Faridabad road. As the monkey is very young, it fell from a tree, and was attacked by a few stray  .
 
 Nikhil Mahesh from Umeed (an animal welfare NGO) told TOI, “We demand a ban on inhumane methods of dealing with monkeys in the city. It is shocking that MCG is sponsoring unethical treatment of animals.”
 
 Dr Shally Mattoo Jalali, a veterinarian, said, “He has fractured both his legs . The blood reports show presence of a drug that has also affected his kidneys and liver. He is under observation and is being given bite   treatment.”
 
 Y S Gupta, MCG joint commissioner, said, “We have given a 24-hour notice to the contractor to explain the situation. We will take strict action against the contractor if he is found guilty.”
