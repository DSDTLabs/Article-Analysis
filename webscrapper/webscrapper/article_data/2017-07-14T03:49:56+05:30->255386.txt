Mumbai: State transport commissioner Praveen Gedam on Thursday issued advisory to applicants of new   (autorickshaws-taxis) to stay clear of   who are operating at RTOs in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. 

 These touts promise a permit to anyone for just Rs 20,000 by forging signatures and making fake domicile certificates of Tehsildar office.
 
 “Citizens should be cautious of unscrupulous agents who may land them in trouble,” Gedam warned. 
 
 The Borivli   on Tuesday blew the lid off the racket by nabbing a tout and getting a   registered against him. Sources said that another tout has been detained while nine more are under scanner.
