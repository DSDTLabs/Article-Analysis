KANPUR: Deputy chief minister   will inaugurate the Govindpuri rail overbridge (RoB) on May 9, said Mahesh Trivedi, BJP MLA from   constituency while talking to mediapersons here on Saturday. He said that it would be named after martyr Capt Ayush Yadav. 

 The construction of the bridge started on March 31, 2013 when SP government was in power. According to cabinet minister Satyadeo Pachauri, it took four years to get the bridge completed because the pace of construction work had been very slow. He however added that the bridge, which connects the south and north ends of the industrial city, would prove to be very beneficial for lakhs of people residing in south city. The new bridge has been constructed parallel to the existing bridge as the latter was not able to bear the increasing traffic load.
 
 "The 746-metre long bridge has been constructed by Setu Nirman Nigam and   at a cost of Rs 43 crore" Pachauri said. 
 
 He said that the deputy CM would also visit the house of martyr Ayush Yadav in   in Jajamu on the same day.
 
 When asked if the bridge would be named after martyr Capt Ayush Yadav, Mahesh Trivedi said that an announcement in this regard would be made during the inaugural function. 
 
 He said that he had requested CM Yogi Adityanath to make South Kanpur a separate district, and has also demanded construction of a 500-bedded hospital with a separate cardiology department.
