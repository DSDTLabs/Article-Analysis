ROHTAK: Eleven months after yoga guru Ramdev delivered an inflammatory speech during ‘Sadhbhavna Sammelan’ here, a local court on Thursday issued summons against him to appear in person on April 29. Congress leader and former   minister of state for home affairs Subhash Batra had submitted an application with a local court for registration of an FIR against him.

 Ramdev, who was made the brand ambassador of yoga by the Haryana government on April 3, 2016, had said at the RSS-backed sammelan that “thousands of heads would have been cut on opposing the chanting of ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai,’ but we respect the country’s Constitution and law of the land”.
 
 After Batra failed to get any response on his complaint at the police station, he approached the local court, which directed the SP to conduct a probe in the case. After hearing the case, the court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) Harish Goyal issued the summons for Ramdev.
 
 On the issuance of summons, Batra said he had been opposing the yoga guru for spreading hatred in society for the past one year. He said that he would not buckle under any pressure and would fight till finish. Batra’s counsel O P Chugh said summons had been issued under sections 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.
