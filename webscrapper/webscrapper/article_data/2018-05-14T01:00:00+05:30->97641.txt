ARA:The legend has it that when Lord Hanuman bared his heart, images of both Lord Rama and Sita appeared on it. Much to the astonishment of the agriculture scientists of Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Bhojpur , a unique plant (about 25 feet in height ) has been identified at Baldeo Singh Ka Tola under Jagdishpur block of Bhojpur district, stems of which on rubbing show the word Ram written in Hindi. 

 Talking to this newspaper on Sunday, Bhojpur Krishi Vigyan Kendra head Pravin Kumar Dwivedi said, “Villagers had informed us about the uniqueness of this plant way back in 2005-06. But we wanted to ascertain the veracity of their claim and since then the plant was kept under our observation. We also wanted to find out that whether it was a temporary phenomenon or a permanent feature of the plant. But after keeping it under observation for so many years, much to our astonishment, we find ‘Ram’ written in hindi very clearly and in all the branches upon rubbing them. Incidentally, only one plant is surviving today, though the villagers say that there were many such plants but they had to cut them to make space for cultivation. There is an urgent need for preservation of this plant for further research and study. I have also informed the principal of VKS College of Agriculture, Dumraon, Prof Ajay Kumar and VC of Rajendra Prasad Central Agriculture University, Pusa, RC Shrivastava and have requested them to send experts to identify the plant species.”
 
 Talking to this newspaper, VKS College of Agriculture principal Ajay Kumar said, “I would personally like to see the plant and I will also send an expert team to find out the species. Ethono botanists can easily identify any plant species. Once identified, it is very easy to multiply the plant by vegetative propagation or reproductive propagation methods.’’ 
 
 While the RAU VC said he can comment only after consulting the botanists of the university.
