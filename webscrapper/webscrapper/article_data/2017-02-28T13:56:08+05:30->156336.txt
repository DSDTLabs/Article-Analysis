LUDHIANA: Continuing to crack the whip on those who have failed to pay their bills,   (PSPCL) on Monday snapped the electricity connection of   (East) in Transport Nagar, five police stations, Punjab Agricultural University government school and a few other government departments. PSPCL junior engineer   said, “We have disconnected the power supply to the sub-registrar office, as it failed to pay its outstanding   of Rs 20 lakh. Our team inspected its premises in the afternoon to check if it has illegally restored the power.“

 Sources said, “PSPCL officials also visited the sub-registrar office (South), which, too, has defaulted on bill payment. It was warned to pay up or face disconnection. Government departments as well as private consumers are yet to pay up outstanding bills of Rs 80 crore till February 24. The drive has helped the power body recover Rs 32.5 crore so far.“
 
 PSPCL senior officers said they started snapping the connections after the defaulters ignored repeated reminders.
 
 For the past few years, the power body has been suffering heavy losses. But with the recovery of outstanding bills, they looked forward to provide quality services to consumers and check power cuts. Notices were also being served on those who procured connections illegally, they added. “Soon, action will be taken against the top defaulters, including municipal corporation, police, hospitals and dispensaries, besides deputy commissioner office,“ said an official.
