SIWAN: The Bihar BJP on Saturday set the twin targets of winning most of the state’s 40 parliamentary seats so that PM   could return to power in 2019 and forming the government in the state on its own by winning the next assembly election.

 State BJP president and party’s Ujiarpur (Samastipur)   announced this in his presidential address at the opening day of party’s two-day state executive committee meet in Siwan. The meeting began a couple of hours after the government-sponsored human chain, formed across the state in support of prohibition, dispersed. 
 
 Party’s former   earlier set the agenda and said the Bihar BJP’s only “unfulfilled dream” was to see a government of its own in the state. “Having won most of the country’s parliamentary seats, the party has given the first BJP government at the Centre. The other dream pertaining to Bihar remains unfulfilled,” Pandey said.
 
 Former eputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi said the BJP and earlier Bharatiya Jan Sangh were been part of the coalition government in Bihar (1967, 1977 and 2005-2013), but the party workers have to realize the party’s twin dreams over the next three years or so.
 
 Union ministers Rajiv Pratap Rudy and Ramkripal Yadav as well as C P Thakur, Nand Kishore Yadav, Prem Kumar and Shahnawaz Hussain were among those present on the occasion. The party also adopted a political resolution, moved by SuMo.
 
 The party said it would campaign for the withdrawal of conditions tied to the payment of unemployment allowance and agitate on the issue of scholarships for SCs, STs and EBCs apart from exposing the ‘Saat Nischay’ initiative of CM  .
 
 Modi paid tributes to the Siwan BJP workers who lost lives battling former RJD MP Mohd Shahabuddin. It was because of their sacrifice that the BJP is holding its state executive committee meet in Siwan, he said.
