NAGPUR: Chairman of tax consultative committee Avinash Thakre said the   (NMC) will not increase general tax (annual letting value) component of   for next five years. Thus, there would be no change in property tax for next five years, if there is no revision in the 14 other components added on to the general tax by the state government and civic body.

 The standing committee headed by   on Friday approved the NMC property tax department’s proposal not to increase 14 components levied on general tax for 2018-19. Thus, there would be no rise in property tax in next fiscal. If a similar decision is taken over next four years, there would be no increase in property tax till 2021-22.
 
 The standing committee also decided to complete revaluation of remaining 42% properties through two private agencies. “Cybertech Softwares was supposed to complete revaluation of 5.36 lakh properties by December 30, 2017, but could finish only 58% properties. We want to complete revaluation of all properties by March 31, so   will also be roped in for the work along with Cybertech,” Jadhav said.
 
 Asked whether Cybertech would face a penalty of Rs10,000 per day as decided by the general body last month, for its failure to complete the work in prescribed time period, Jadhav said they needed to take legal opinion on it. “NMC can levy penalty of Rs500 per day as per the work order,” he said.
 
 Jadhav also refused to comment whether NMC can impose new condition of penalty on Cybertech with retrospective effect, as work order came to an end on December 30 last year.
 
 Thakre said the department has been directed to launch a system where property tax amount will be deducted from accounts of taxpayers automatically every month. “Recovery of tax is very poor due to negligence of department. Taxpayers will pay tax regularly if they know their due amount and get the facilities. We are about to launch an app for paying tax. On the lines of MSEDCL, tax amount will be deducted from bank accounts every month in case consent is given by taxpayer. Directives have also been given to send messages through SMS and WhatsApp to inform taxpayers about their dues, due date etc,” he said.
 
 Water works department’s proposal to undertake works worth Rs5.35 crore for tackling water crisis during upcoming summer was also approved. Jadhav said he slammed department officials for delay in beginning process. “This proposal should have come in December, so that works can commence before summer. Now, works will not be finished during summer. Also, a proposal seeking Rs6.73 crore from the government for more works will take a long time,” he said.
