Chennai: An aspiring law student’s plea to create additional seats for open category candidates in UG law courses in government law colleges to compensate 69% reservation provided to other categories has been dismissed by the Madras high court .

 Justice K Ravichandrabaabu passed the order on a plea moved by S Aishwarya seeking a direction to the Tamil Nadu higher education department and the Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University to create additional seats and admit her in BA LLB (Hons) or BBA LLB (Hons) course in the current academic year. 
 
 The petitioner applied for five years integrated law degree course in the Tamil Nadu Dr Ambedkar Law University. 
 
  “Had the university adopted 50% reservation for backward communities, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, as per the Supreme Court directive, I would have got a chance to secure the admission in the open category,” the petitioner said.
 
 The judge said, “After perusal of the Supreme Court order, it is evident that the court passed the order for creating additional seats only for that particular year and therefore, now the petitioner cannot approach this court and seek for creation of additional seat for this year as well.”
