KOLKATA: Within 24 hours of nearly 20 passengers on the 12278 Puri-Howrah   falling ill after having breakfast served on the train,   ( ) Ltd has show-caused the licencee engaged for on-board catering. The inquiry is still on and test results for the food samples sent to two laboratories are awaited. 

 
 Railway officials have also come to know that all passengers who complained of discomfort had purchased their tickets from the same travel agency. Efforts are now being made to find out whether their food and lodging at Puri was also arranged by this agency. "If we come to know that the affected passengers had food served from the same source on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, there is a distinct possibility of contamination in the food they had before boarding the train. How else can only one group from a specific agency out of 470 people? We are also trying to find out their hotel in Puri. It may help us sort out the issue in case nothing wrong is found in the food served by the caterer," an official said.
 
 IRCTC group general manager, east,   confirmed that M/s Doon's Caterers has been show-caused pending an inquiry. "We are still awaiting the test results. However, this is a step that will help us proceed against the company in case the food is found contaminated. We are taking the matter very seriously," he said.
 
 All 14 passengers who were admitted to the   (SER) hospital in   on Wednesday afternoon have been released after treatment. Arrangements have also been made for their return to Kolkata.
 
 While agreeing that several licencees have been penalized in the past for poor service on trains, a senior railway official said the amount paid to the caterers may not be sufficient to ensure best quality of food.
