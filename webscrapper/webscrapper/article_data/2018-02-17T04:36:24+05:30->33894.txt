The Pune   can now move to arrest developer D S Kulkarni and his wife, Hemanti, in a cheating case even as the couple’s anticipatory bail application is pending and is likely to be heard by the high court on March 7. At the time of going to press, the police said they did not know the whereabouts of Kulkarni and his wife. DCP (crime) Pankaj Dahane, who is holding an officiating charge of the economic offences wing (EOW), said, “We are searching for the couple and their son, Shirish. We have formed four   comprising crime branch and EOW officials to track them down.” On February 9, special judge J T Utpat in Pune had rejected Shirish’s anticipatory bail application, saying that it was for the investigating officer to decide after any inquiry to ascertain his involvement in the case.
