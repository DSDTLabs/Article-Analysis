Chandigarh: Development of the country is not possible till water rights are included in human rights, said Rajendra Singh,   of India and Ramon Magsaysay award winner. Delivering the keynote address on the theme, “Globalisation, environment and human rights” at Panjab University, Singh said human rights are incomplete without water rights because water is a basic necessity. He began the speech saying the 21st century is one of dangerous landscapes as incidents of droughts and floods increased 10 times in 2017. 

 Rajendra recounted how he and members of the community who supported him built 11,800 ponds and dams to rejuvenate natural resources and climate in Rajasthan. He said they did not take money from the Centre and state government for this, relying on the community instead. 
 
 “One person in a village made 51 ponds each and that is how we made 11,800 ponds,” said Rajendra, adding that they could recharge 2.5 lakh wells in Rajasthan. “Earlier, India ruled the world because we respected neeri (water), nari (women) and nadi (rivers). Now that we have stopped respecting these, we are no longer a world power. We are no more global teachers of the world, which we were earlier,” said Rajendra. 
 
 Narrating how an elderly village resident shared with him indigenous techniques of water conservation, he emphasised the need to understand climate problems at the grass-root level to resolve them. According to him, a number of village residents have more knowledge of geo-hydro science than many experts. He also talked about the struggle he undertook to bring water in the main agenda of environmental bodies across the world. 
 
 The national seminar has been jointly organised by the NHRC and department of Hindi, Panjab University. The inaugural session of the seminar started with tree plantation by S C Sinha, member, NHRC.
