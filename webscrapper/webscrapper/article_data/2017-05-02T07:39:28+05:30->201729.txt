BENGALURU:  , who had   at Rs 200, ended up paying double the proposed rate to watch   on Monday.

 The CM had been under pressure from the Kannada film industry to cap movie ticket prices and he was supposed to sign an order to this effect before Baahubali 2 hit the screens on Friday. But he left for Dubai on Thursday without signing the order and the ticket prices for Baahubali 2 remained Rs 500 upwards at multiplexes.
 
 On returning from Dubai, Siddaramaiah decided to watch the movie on Monday as his grandson Vikas insisted on it. Vikas, who is the son of Siddaramaiah’s first-born, Rakesh, is said to have insisted on watching the movie as he had already watched the first part and wanted his grandfather to accompany him for the second.
 
  Accompanied by his second son Yathindra and Vikas, the CM went to a multiplex in a private vehicle to watch the blockbuster movie.
 
 “It was supposed to be a private affair, but the information got leaked to the media,” sources close to the CM said. After watching the movie, Siddaramaiah is learnt to have pulled up the protocol officers. “Baahubali 2 had not been listed on the CM’s itinerary for the day. Moreover, the CM was watching the film at a time when Kannada organizations have been demanding capping of multiplex ticket rates,” an official pointed out.
 
 Later, having finished his “family commitment”, Siddaramaiah went for a private screening of a Kannada film at Chamundeshwari Studios. Niruttara, the movie, has been produced by Kannada actress Bhavana, who is also an active Congress member. Recently, the CM also watched Puneet Rajkumar’s Raajakumar. For Niruttara, the CM was accompanied by KPCC president and home minister G Parameshwara and infrastructure development minister Roshan Baig, apart from other party workers.
