NAGPUR: Former chief minister   on Wednesday said that the party’s state unit has decided to allow the party’s local units to go in for alliance with like-minded parties for municipal corporation elections. “In corporations which would witness a direct fight between   and NCP, whom will we ally with,” he said while replying to a question on possible statewide alliance with NCP for civic polls.

 Given the deteriorating performance in NMC polls — from 8 seats in 2007 to 6 in 2012 — the NCP is putting in all efforts to keep party’s existence in the city. “While the party’s relationship with the Congress is not clear, the NCP has also kept channels of communication open with other parties and that goes for party leaders as well,” confirmed a senior NCP leader. 
 
 Recently, NCP MLC   approached   for tie-up in the NMC polls. This party has two corporators in 2012, while in 2007 the party had just one.
