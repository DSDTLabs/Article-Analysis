TRICHY: Defending the company’s right for exploration, corporate communications CNS deputy general manager   said on Tuesday that the   oil wells have the government’s valid consent to operate ( ) in the state.

 “ONGC has drilled a total of 712 wells in  , of which 380 have run dry and were abandoned. A total of 304 wells are oil and gas wells which are connected to various production installations. As many as 181 wells are presently operational. Twenty-eight wells are utility wells which are connected to the installations,” he said
 
 As per   resolution Number 111-6, there is no permanent environmental pollution from the oil wells connected to the production installations. It was decided that ONGC’s wells may be exempted from a further renewal of consent order after connecting to the production installations.
 
 ONGC is required to apply for and does pay consent fees for all the wells during exploration. Once production has commenced and the wells connected to the production installations, there is no need for individual wells to pay fees for renewal of consent. The fees would be collected from the production installation for all the wells connected to it, he said.
 
 “ONGC has applied for consent to operate (CTO) along with consent fees for all the wells before commencing drilling operation. Also, ONGC has been regularly applying for renewal of CTO for production installations along with consent fees, and the same is granted by TNPCB. Hence, all the connected wells are covered under ‘consent to operate’,” he said.
