MUMBAI: A video posted by PM   on his official Twitter handle as a tribute to   on his birth anniversary on Monday evoked criticism on the social media platform for featuring Sambhaji Bhide, one of the main accused in the   violence case.

 Bhide, 85, founder president of the Shiv Pratisthan, is, in a photo which is part of the 1.35-minutelong video, seen sharing the dais with Modi. It comes right at the end of the video after various images of the Shivaji statue at  , pictures of Modi at the fort and excerpts from a Modi speech in which he says that though it is hard to imagine a hero like Shivaji being reborn, ordinary Indians could turn themselves into 'Seva-jis' and by doing one act of 'Seva' every day, help fulfil Shivaji's dreams.
 
 Several Twitter users asked why the PM had included a picture of his with an accused as part of the video. Some others said the picture made it clear why Bhide, booked soon after the Koregaon-Bhima violence, had still not been arrested. Others accused Bhide of trying to create a rift between Hindus and Muslims. Supporters of Bhide too posted on the site, saying the man was a follower of Shivaji and had been framed in the case. Bhide himself has claimed he was not involved in the violence in which one youth died.
