GHAZIABAD: Days after a   carrying 17 children caught fire in Indirapuram, a   ferrying 52 passengers went up in flames owing to a short circuit in the wiring system of the bus near the Old Bus Stand in   around 2.30pm on Saturday. 

 However, all the passengers, including the conductor and the driver, were safely evacuated from the vehicle moments before it was enveloped in flames, and no injury was reported. The bus was going from Anand Vihar bus stand towards Muradabad. Smoke was seen coming out from the engine when the bus was about to reach the Old Bus Stand. Muhammad Aamir, the bus conductor, said, “I heard a small blast and saw smoke emanating from the engine of the bus. I immediately asked everyone to get down.”
 
  The bus caught fire a few minutes later. According to sources, the front portion of the bus was completely charred. The blaze was intense and it took more than 25 minutes to control the flames, according to Brij Mohan Sharma, a firefighter.
 
 “We came to know about the fire by 2.55pm. Two fire engines were sent, but the fire had already been doused by a fire tender that was passing through the spot,” said Satish Sharma, acting fire safety officer, Kotwali Fire Station.
 
 P K Bose, regional manager, UPSRTC, said: “The engine’s heat combined with summer heat causes short circuits. We found in the preliminary investigation that the short circuit occurred in the self-starter assembly component of the bus, which led to the fire.”
