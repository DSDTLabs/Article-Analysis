CHARMINAR: A city-based religious leader has urged Muslims to exercise caution before buying prayer rugs, mats or carpets that have been manufactured in China. 

 Maulana  , who is a member of the  , a body of Muslim religious leaders, said given the restrictions on practising Islam in China, which have been reported in sections of the media, it is better to 'think twice before buying' Chinese prayer carpets. "We have read that China has placed several restriction on Uighur Muslims from practising the faith, including some on sporting beards and others rituals. A country that stops people even to a certain degree from praying and also has some restrictions on naming their own children according to wishes of parents is strange and undesirable. In this connection, buying prayer rugs that have been manufactured by that very country is inappropriate," he said. 
 
  said that India is an industrialised country and its manufacturing centre has the capacity to cater to its population. 
 
 "Everything is being made here, including janamaaz (prayer carpets and mats). Therefore, it is better to buy janamaaz , which have been manufactured here instead of China," he said. China is home to approximately a crore Uighur Muslims in the   province. Reports say that the government has placed certain restrictions on long beards and also on women wearing veils. In the past, it had reportedly disallowed these Muslims from fasting in the month of Ramzan.
