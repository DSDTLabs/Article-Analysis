KOLKATA: When a   invaded a   at   last Sunday, the airline ended up evicting   passengers instead of the uninvited guests. 

 Till the IndiGo plane landed at Patna airport from Lucknow at 6.05 pm on February 19, the flight was uneventful and rather dull. The action began as soon as the flight attendants opened the two doors for passengers who were to alight at Patna or board from there for the next leg of the flight to Kolkata. 
 
 According to a passenger on board the flight, mosquitoes in hundreds rushed into the cabin and began biting with a vengeance. 
 
 The invasion had flyers squirming in their seats but two passengers were particularly agitated and voiced their protest. "How can we travel with so many mosquitoes for an hour?" fumed one. The other, too, joined in with a few expletives when the flight attendants said they could do little to help.
 
 The continued buzzing and bites from the invaders caused enough irritation to drive the two passengers into a rage. While other flyers were also in obvious discomfort, they were more eager to reach Kolkata and hence, willing to suffer the vectors during the flight. But not the incensed duo. 
 
 The two flyers insisted that the mosquitoes be banished from the plane before it took off for the rest of its journey to Kolkata.
