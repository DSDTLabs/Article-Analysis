NEW DELHI: VIP lounges at Indian airports are passé. The   government wants a “VVIP terminal” for its top authorities like the CM and governor at Jaipur airport.

 “The Airports Authority of India (AAI) has received a request from the Rajasthan government for construction of   terminal at Jaipur Airport.
 
 AAI has already offered 2.5 acres for this,” MoS for civil aviation   in a written reply to a question in Rajya Sabha on Tuesday. An AAI official said: “The Rajasthan government has a combined fleet of three or four small aircraft and helicopter. The administration wanted a separate apron and a small terminal for use by the CM, governor and other dignitaries.” The cost of the VVIP terminal, which is yet to be determined, will be borne by the state.
 
 “Initially we will give 2.5 acres at Jaipur airport for the separate apron and VVIP terminal. In exchange, we will get an equivalent plot near the airport. There are huge tracts of land near and next to the Jaipur Airport where we will expand our facilities.
 
 Land for airports is anyway given by states and we do not buy it,” the official said. Delhi’s IGI Airport has a Palam Technical Area for the exclusive use of the President, Vice-President and PM. More than a terminal, this area is a high security apron where   is parked.
 
 “Some states have dedicated aprons and Jaipur will not be the first to have this,” said the official. Only a few airports like those at Patna and Lucknow have dedicated space for VVIPs.
