 Mahesh Kumar, Shibu's friend said they did not do anything illegal, “We did not obstruct them from dis posing of the waste products. We only stopped it till members from the Pollution Control Board (PCB) could come and inspect the waste they were going to dispose of.“
 
 MP Trideep Kumar, PCB officer, said that they were only informed after Shibu had blocked the Isro from disposing the junk.
 
 Police said the Isro have the permission to dispose the waste products at sea as per a court order.
 
 “Isro won a case against PCB in 1996-97, allowing them to dispose their waste products into deep sea. They are disposing ammonium perchlorate, which is an inorganic substance, in that respect, it can also be classified as toxic but at deep sea levels it is not harmful," said Dinesh KS, an assistant environmental engineer at PCB.
 
 But Mahesh said that But Mahesh said that the Isro was disposing these waste products in Vembanad Lake. “We first started observing the days during which the fishes were found dead by the lake, and then we found that it was around the same time that they were disposing their waste as well," Mahesh said.
 
 He said that they were disposing the waste products before they had reached the sea. Trideep Kumar, “We are not sure about that, but I doubt ISRO would dispose the waste at Vembanad Lake."
