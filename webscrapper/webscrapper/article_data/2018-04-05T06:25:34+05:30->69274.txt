KOLKATA: The utilities stacked in the ground-floor of an old Camac   building were completely gutted in a fire that broke out around 3.45pm on Wednesday. It took three fire tenders nearly 40 minutes to douse the flames that were rapidly spreading through the wooden staircase of the three-storied, 2   building. 

 No injuries were reported as the building, located a few meters off   park, was uninhabited. It only had a caretaker, locals said. Fire officials said the blaze must have started from a ground-floor meter box. The ground floor also had a few shops, which were closed.
 
 A stretch on Camac Street, towards  , was shut for traffic for nearly half-an-hour as firemen and police battled the flames. This created traffic snarls at the otherwise busy   intersection.
 
 "A probe has been initiated to identify the building owners and find out whether the structure had a requisite firefighting mechanism," a fire officer said. An officer of the Park Street police station said, "The fire appears to have been triggered due to a short circuit in the meter box. But we are awaiting the final probe report."
