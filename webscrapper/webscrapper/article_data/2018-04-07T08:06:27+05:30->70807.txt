AHMEDABAD: A   in limbo in an Iran prison, at the mercy of the   and India because of a discrepancy in how his father’s name is written in correspondence between the Iranian and Indian governments and how it appears on his passport.

 Umar Saleh Mohammad Thaim (47) is in Minab jail in Iran. According to a letter from minister of   (MEA) Sushma Swaraj to MoS agriculture Parshottam Rupala, Thaim could not be released along with two of his colleagues due to this discrepancy.
 
 
 “Our embassy in Tehran has informed that the matter was taken up with Iranian authorities at all levels for waiver of the penalty and early release of Sajid, Ebrahim and Thaim on  . Due to persistent efforts made by our embassy, Sajid   and Ebrahim Razzaq Sap have since reached India. Omar Saleh Mohammad Thaim could not be released due to the discrepancy in his father’s name.
 
  The case for rectification of his father’s name is under process,” reads Swaraj’s reply to Rupala’s October 10, 2016 letter, written at the instance of Thaim family. Sap and Samra, were freed this February, when the Iran government released several prisoners on mercy grounds.
 
 “The MEA, in its correspondence with the Iran government, spelled Thaim’s father’s name as ‘Saleh Mohammad’. On his passport, it appears as ‘Salemamad Thaim Sidik’, said former president of the Kutchi Vahanvata Association, Kasam Jafrabadi. Thaim, the sole breadwinner of the family, has been in jail in Iran since August 4, 2014.
 
 On Thursday, Jaffrabadi wrote to Swaraj. “We were told that Thaim could not be released with the two others because of a mistake in his father’s name. We request you to take this matter on priority and process the procedure to correct Thaim’s father’s name so he can be released at the earliest,” Jafrabadi wrote.
