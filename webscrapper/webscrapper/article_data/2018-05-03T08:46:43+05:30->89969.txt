BENGALURU: Royal Challengers Bangalore’s pacer  , who won the ‘Man of the Match’ award in his second match and helped his team beat Mumbai Indian on Tuesday, says   was a smart bowling unit.

 
 “Firstly, we scraped through to a good total on this wicket. There was a little bit of assistance with swing which we haven’t seen in the previous games. We bowled well upfront, and we were able to take wickets which made it tough for them to gain any momentum. We bowled and assessed the conditions really well.”
 
 On their bowling mantra on a successful night, the 29-year-old pointed out: “We went to our strongest skill-set and that’s trying to swing the ball. There was a little bit of assistance with the swing and we were able to take those early wickets.”
