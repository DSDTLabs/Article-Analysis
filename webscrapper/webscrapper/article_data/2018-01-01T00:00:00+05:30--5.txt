Sandalwoodâ€™s chic set do not prefer the oft-repeated Goa routine for the new Year vacations. Instead, they chose places across Asia and Europe to head to, where they spent their holiday season in great sass and style. Take a look...

 Sanjjanaa 
 The multi-lingual actress is off to  , one of her favourite getaways, with her closest set of friends. Given how Sanjjanaa is known to be the party-starter everywhere she goes, we are sure that the people in Colombo are going to have a great time, Sanjjanaa style!
 
  
 The   actress is giving everyone serious vacation goals with her quirky photographs and   stories from her holiday in Sri Lanka. We really love how this girl knows to have a good time and also add a dash of adventure into everything she does!
 
 Kabir Duhan Singh 
 The Hebbuli villain was in Dubai for the last week of the year, where he managed to mix a bit of work and leisure. He totally seems to be living it up going by this picture of his!
 
 Vikky Varun 
 The College   actor has been slaying it in Dubai, going by his Instagram stories. Check this picture of his with a mean machine with savage wheels! We totally love how this youngster is enjoying his good times, especially as the last year gave him much to cheer about. 
 
  
 The leggy lass, who says that 2018 has a lot in store for her in terms of releases and films, is soaking in the best of both worlds that UK has to offer. From chilling in the serene country side to partying in the best nightclubs, she knows how to have fun!
 
 Harshika Poonacha 
 The actress has had a great end to 2017 and has brought in 2018 in style, as she travelled across Europe to places like Amsterdam and Paris and posted pictures that had everyone feeling envious of her!
 
  Gopal 
 Fitness expert and occasional actor Sangeetha also travelled across Europe to France and   to bring in Christmas, her birthday and the New Year. Now, that is what we call landing in a triple dhamaka!
