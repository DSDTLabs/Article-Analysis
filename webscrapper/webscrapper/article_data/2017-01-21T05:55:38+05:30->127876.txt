Mumbai: Notwithstanding the initial refusal, the   is set to join hands with the Sharad Pawar-led   for the  , following pressure from senior party leaders.

 Mumbai Congress president   confirmed to TOI that a seat-sharing formula with NCP is on cards mainly to defeat communal forces. “We had a prolonged meeting on the preparations for the BMC polls. Many senior leaders expressed the view that to avoid a split in secular votes, we should join hands with the NCP,” he said. “Besides granting all 14 seats that NCP had won in the 2012 polls, we will share some more seats with them. We will ensure the Shiv Sena’s defeat.”
 
 Earlier, when Nirupam had made it clear that the Congress will not tie up with the NCP, Sachin Ahir had declared NCP’s first list of 45 candidates for the BMC polls. Subsequently, not only state NCP president Sunil Tatkare and NCP Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule, but even Pawar stressed the need for an alliance with the Congress, but Nirupam had rejected the proposal.
 
 Meanwhile, the on-going cold war between Nirupam and former city Congress president   took a new turn on Friday, when the latter distanced himself from the selection of nominees and BMC polls campaigning.
 
 In a text message to Congress activists, Kamat said: “All applicants for nominations are requested to contact their local legislators and district Congress president to get the party nominations as I have withdrawn from the entire exercise of selection of candidates and campaign due to the negative attitude of Nirupam.”
 
 Nirupam refused to comment on Kamat’s message. “My top priority is to prepare the list of nominees and ensure a victory.” He said nominees are being finalized as per the guidelines prescribed by AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi.
