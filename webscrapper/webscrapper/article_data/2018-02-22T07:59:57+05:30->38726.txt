CHENNAI: Venting anger on hard, inanimate objects is usually foolishly self-harmful. It turned out to be even worse for an engineering student from   who, finding that an   near the   metro rail depot was on the blink on Wednesday morning, smashed a security camera in the kiosk.

 A customer outside mistook  , 21, for a burglar, shut the kiosk door and alerted passersby.
 
 
 A large crowd gathered and, refusing to believe the student’s pleas of innocence, gave him a sound beating. They bound his legs with a cord and handed him over to the police.
 
 “Samuel entered the kiosk at 9.30am and tried several times to swipe his debit card and withdraw cash,” a police officer said. “The customer outside grew suspicious at the time he was taking and was startled when he turned violent. He assumed that Samuel was trying to break open the machine.”
 
 Samuel, a third-year BE student whose father is a headmaster in a Tiruvallur school and mother a nursing superintendent at a city hospital, told the police that he lost his anger when the ATM failed to work.
 
 “The youngster apologised and his parents promised to replace the camera, so we let him off with a warning,” the officer said.
