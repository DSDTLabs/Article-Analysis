AHMEDABAD: A special   court on Saturday denied bail to Surat-based businessman Jignesh Bhajiyawala in a   case, for allegedly converting old   into the new ones after demonetization of high-value currency notes last year.

 The enforcement directorate ( ) arrested him in January and found that he operated 1,109 bank accounts through various persons to get old notes worth between Rs 1 crore and Rs 3.5 crore exchanged. 
 
 Some 300 such accounts have been identified by investigators. While denying him bail, special judge A C Joshi observed that Bhajiyawala may influence witnesses and tamper with evidence if freed. “In such a case, where the national economy is involved which lead to anti-social interest of public at large i.e. to say accumulation of money by particular group of person- violates the Sec. 3 and 4 of the PMLA, therefore, also this is not the fit case to exercise the discretion U/s 439 of CrPC,” the court order reads. The court also observed that money laundering is a victimless crime and it weakens the social fabric and collective ethical standards.
