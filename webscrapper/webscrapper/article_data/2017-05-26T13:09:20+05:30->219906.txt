MOHALI: After a struggle of more than five years, Mohali   has finally completed the process of land acquisition for construction of a solid waste management plant at Samgoli village in Dera Bassi. An announcement to the effect was made by mayor   with MC commissioner   on Wednesday. 

 Greater   (Gmada) released an amount of Rs 28.09 crore through the Mohali MC to the land acquisition collector (LAC) cum sub divisional magistrate (SDM), Dera Bassi, said mayor Kulwant Singh.
 
 The MC already deposited Rs 3 crore with LAC-SDM Dera Bassi for acquisition of 50 acres of land at a cost of Rs 31.09 crore. The mayor said, "Money has been paid by GMADA for acquisition of land but through the MC. We have completed the process of acquiring land for setting up of the solid waste management plant and now we will get its possession. The detailed project report (DPR) is being prepared by the consultant,   (ILFS), hired by Punjab government to set up the plant. Once the DPR is prepared, we will proceed to take possession of the land and call for expression of interest. The project is likely to start in one year." 
 
 The company hired for the project will ensure that no foul smell is emitted by the plant. It will also see that the site does not affect anyone and is not located near any river, lake or pond. The MC will plant many fresh trees in and around the plant to maintain greenery, said MC commissioner Rajesh Dhiman.
 
 Dhiman said the plant will segregate bio-degradable and non-biodegradable waste collected by the contractor from houses. The garbage thus segregated will be subjected to a chemical process and converted into pellets for various uses. Fire and brick pellets can also be made for industrial and construction process. There are plans to use the garbage for the production of electricity as it can be fed to the thermal plant as well.
