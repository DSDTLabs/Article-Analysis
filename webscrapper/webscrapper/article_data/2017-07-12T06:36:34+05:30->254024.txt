 The MLA supported the no-confidence motion moved by 11 Congress-backed independent councillors in the House of 15 to dethrone council president Sarbjit Kaur Nago.

It was accepted by the 12 members, including the APP MLA, and the resolution will be forwarded to higher authorities to issue a notification regarding removal of Sarabjit.
 
 The outgoing president Sarabjit and three councillors stayed away from the meeting. AAP MLA claimed there was no politics behind supporting the motion.
 
 “The 11 councillors tabled a motion against the sitting president. It was supported by MLA Pirmal. The motion has been accepted by 12 member,” confirmed Tapa SDM Bikramjit Singh Shergill.
 
 Sources said it would take nearly a fortnight to complete the formalities and a Congress-backed councillor would eventually be elected as the Tapa MC president.
 
 When contacted, Pirmal said the sitting president was not taking any interest in the developmental activities. “The development of Tapa had come to a standstill. The monsoon season has begun but the town had no sewerage plan. I supported the move so that developmental works happen. There is no politics behind it as the councillors who tabled the motion are not from the Congress, though they may be supported by it,” he added.
