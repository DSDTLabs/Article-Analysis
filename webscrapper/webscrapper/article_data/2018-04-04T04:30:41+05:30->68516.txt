MUMBAI: An   , who allegedly gave a contract of   to three men, has come under the police scanner.

 The NRI businessman,  , was keen to recover Rs 7 crore from a builder and contacted three men,   alias Attar Dubai (33), Ashfaq Khan Mir (36) and   (31). The three told the builder to come to a hotel in Bandra and demanded that he pay them Rs 1.5 crore. During the investigation, it transpired that the builder had in 2011 started constructing a tower at Prabhadevi. Banker booked a 1,400 sq ft flat worth Rs 8.5 crore and paid Rs 7.23 crore to the builder. Legal wrangles delayed the project.
 
 Rupin approached the builder and told him to cancel the deal. When the builder told him that it was not possible, Rupin demanded Rs 11 crore as damages. “I tried to make him understand, but he didn’t listen,” the builder told TOI. “It appears that Banker had offered one Athar Hyderabadi Rs 1.5 crore if he recovered his Rs 7 crore. We have summoned Banker,” said assistant police commissioner Sunil Deshmukh.
