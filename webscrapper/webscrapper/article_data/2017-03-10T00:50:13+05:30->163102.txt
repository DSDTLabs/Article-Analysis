THANE: Police investigators said on Thursday that the three personnel from the   (ARO) accused in the   case were also involved in parallel rackets like changing the marks of failed candidates for a premium.

 The police said the three would source the entire personal data of the applicants from office computers before approaching candidates through agents with an offer to improve their marks in the written and other exams.
 
 A police officer said the three havaldar clerks, Ravi Kumar, Dharamvir Singh and Nigam Kumar Pandey, all attached to the ARO in Nagpur, played a key role in sourcing the data of the candidates.
 
 “The trio stole the data from the offices of the AROs at Nagpur and Kolhapur using a pen drive and CD. They passed this data on to (coaching class owner) Santosh Shinde and Dhanaji Jadhav, who would then take a printout from local cyber cafes and contact the candidates,” the officer said.
 
 It was found that Shinde and Jadhav were in touch with a contact in the army and would tell him to change the results of the candidates.
 
 “In the biggest shock to us, we found several messages exchanged between this army man and Shinde and Jadhav. They are telling this army man to pass the candidates who have failed the medical and physical tests,” a senior police officer said.
 
 The accused played safe and never bought sim cards in their names, said officers familiar with the inquiry.
