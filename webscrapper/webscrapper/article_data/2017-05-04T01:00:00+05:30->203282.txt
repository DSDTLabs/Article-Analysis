While his brother   is reckoned as one of the most popular faces on TV, Rohit has been rather selective about taking up projects on the small screen. Last seen in ' ' two years ago, the actor will soon return to TV with Siddharth Kumar Tewary’s historical show ' '. He will play Porus’ father, King Bamni, who went on to become the King of Pauravas. 
What prompted Rohit to do the show was that it will be a finite series, after which he will move on to direct a film. 
 A source informs, “The show will be made on a grand scale. The first schedule will kick off in Thailand. Extensive research has been done on the costumes, which have been designed keeping in mind the attire worn in 300-360 BC. Rohit’s costumes will be embroidered with gold threads, which is a first for a TV show.”
