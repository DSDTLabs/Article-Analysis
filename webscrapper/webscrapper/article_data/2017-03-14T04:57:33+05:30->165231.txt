CHENNAI: The suspected oil leak spotted on   on Sunday was found to be sewage, overflowing from a sewerage manhole, mixed with cooking oil. Officials suspect that the oil came from waste disposed of by eateries located nearby.

 A team of officials from Chennai Metro Rail Limited and   inspected the spot opposite a dargah on Anna Salai and took away samples of the liquid for further tests. The site was barricaded after passersby complained about the spill. 
 
 A Metrowater official, who visited the spot, said it was not a leak but overflowing sewage from an inspection chamber located under a makeshift median. “We have been pumping out sewage from inspection chambers. This is just an overflow. It is nothing toxic,” he said. 
 
 Tunnel boring work has long been completed at the location where the suspected oil leak was reported. The tunnel boring machines are currently excavating close to  . 
 
 “There was a similar overflow reported in the same location a month back. It definitely cannot be because of our tunneling because that work got over about two years back. Work for the   station is underway but its location is away from the spot where the liquid was leaking,” a metro rail official said.
