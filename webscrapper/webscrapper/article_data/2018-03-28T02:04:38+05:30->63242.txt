GURUGRAM: NHAI has revised rates of passage at the Kherki Daula  , to be effective from April 1. 

 According to a letter (dated March 26) by general manager (technical) Dinesh Yadav to the NHAI Gurugram project director, all toll rates at the plaza have been increased by Rs 5. “Any car which earlier had to pay Rs 60, will now shell out Rs 65. Similarly, LCVs will have to pay Rs 95 instead of Rs 90, while minibuses and trucks, which were earlier paying Rs 185, will now pay Rs 190…” Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI, Gurugram, said, “The rates for   have been revised as per contract, and linked with the wholesale price index (WPI).”
 
 The last time rates at this toll plaza were revised was in October 2016, when NHAI had rounded off earlier rates, like Rs 59 for cars to Rs 60, Rs 87 for LCVs to Rs 85, etc, as the exact amounts were difficult to pay with cash, and availability of change has been a pressing issue at the toll plaza for long. Expressway concessionaire Millennium City Expressway Private Limited (MCEPL) official T Raju said, “We can only look into the issue of availability of change after April 1.” The rounding-off was thus done for the convenience of passengers, so that the latter didn’t have to waste time for want of small change. 
 
 MCEPL said the revision was necessary as the cost of maintenance has increased. “Every month, we’re paying huge bills for electricity, road repair, toll booths, computer systems, etc, at the plaza. The revision was necessary to help us beat cost escalation,” said S Raghuraman, CEO, MCEPL. 
 
 There are 25 lanes at  , which generate Rs 43.87 lakh every day on existing rates. With the new rates, this is set to increase to Rs 46.30 lakh a day.
