Vadodara: After long delay, the M S University (MSU)   issued notification for the MSU Students’ Union polls on Thursday.

 According to the notification, the polls for the posts of vice-president, general secretary and faculty representatives will be held on October 5. Along with the posts of MSUSU office bearers, the polls for faculty students’ association will also be held on the same day. Though the election date has been fixed at October 5, as per the J M Lyngdoh committee’s recommendations, which were adopted by MSU last year, the university has to organize the students’ union polls on last working day of August every year.
 
 The last day for submission of nomination forms will be September 26 and that for withdrawal is September 28. The results of the elections will be announced on the same day of the polls. According to university officials, those students who have paid the fees on or before September 21 will be eligible for contesting elections.
 
 The university had been dragging its feet in holding the elections to salvage the image of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), BJP’s student outfit, which is likely to face reverses this year. It is worth mentioning here that it was only after student outfits except the ABVP launched a major stir at the campus that the university’s syndicate body declared that the union polls.
 
 Later, it was only after student outfits staged another protest that the university appointed returning officer for the polls.
