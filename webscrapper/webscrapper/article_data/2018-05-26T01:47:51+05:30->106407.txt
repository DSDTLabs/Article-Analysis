GURUGRAM: Doctors at a city-based private hospital claimed to have successfully performed left atrial appendage closure, touted as a rare surgery, on a 69-year-old man earlier this week to reduce chances of a possible stroke.

 Om  , a retired engineer from  , was taken to a local private hospital last week after he complained of irregular heartbeats. According to doctors, he had suffered atrial fibrillation, which could cause blood clots, leading to a stroke. Within hours, doctors there referred him to Gurugram’s Paras Hospitals.
 
 After scanning his heart using transesophageal echo, doctors at the city hospital decided to do a surgery, which involves shutting of the left atrial appendage, a vestigial part of the heart, where clots are formed due to fast heartbeats.
 
 Doctors said the clots could travel to the brain, kidney or other parts of the heart, resulting in a stroke or a paralysis.
 
 According to Dr.  , who led a team of doctors to perform the surgery, this rare procedure had been performed only on 10 patients in the country since it was introduced in 2014, half of which were open heart. The surgery using catheters, as was done in this case, is a rare procedure with considerable risk. “The procedure started in 2017 only,” he said.
