BELAGAVI: To put an end to the   menace in examination, the   asked all the 212 government, aided and non-aided   centres to install   cameras by the end of January, or face the axe from the test centre list.

 In this connection, the department of public instruction clarified that of the SSLC   centres across the district, 97 are listed in   and 112 in  . The decision was taken in view of alleged mass copying menace in rural SSLC examination centres. The department issued the order to all private SSLC examination centres under the supervision of private management schools, government aided schools and government schools.
 
 The CCTVs are to be installed in such a way that all 24 students of each examination hall should be covered in 360 degree angle and the monitoring system should be installed in the office of the examination superintendent.
 
 If examination centres fail to oblige the order in installing CCTV cameras, their accreditation will be cancelled and students of that examination centre will be moved to any nearby examination centre. Once the installation process is completed, the institution should submit an installation certificate. If institutions fail to comply with the order, the department will extend the deadline for installation of CCTV cameras but it should be complete well before the examination process starts.
 
 Chikkodi DDPI Gajanan Mannikeri told TOI that although a deadline has been given to private education institutions, in special cases, the deadline could be extended to February if they give a letter of undertaking. 
 
 For the installation of CCTVs in government-run schools, funds will be arranged by consolidating local resources or the department will provide money, he said.
