PANAJI:   dependants, including barge and truck owners and workers’ unions, urged minister for shipping, road transport and highways,  , to ensure that mining restarts as soon as possible as it was a matter of their livelihood and survival.

 Gadkari, on Tuesday, held marathon meetings with several stakeholders. 
 
 Stating that mining operations should start immediately, president of the   Raymond D’Sa, said banks/financial institutions should stop coercive action against them for loan recovery as their only business — mining — has been stopped. “We don’t say that 88 mining leases should start, but we want the Goa government to start mining activities,” he said, adding that the apex court has not said anything about the state’s other mining leases and that the government should initiate the process to start those.
 
 He also said that the debt relief scheme for mining affected be extended beyond March 31. 
 
 Union leader Puti Gaonkar said the state government has the power to grant the leases and has requested it to ensure that mining employees do not lose their jobs.
 
 President of the All Goa Truck Owners Association, Nilkant Gauns, said they have requested Gadkari to restart mining activities. Gauns said they have not been able to repay loans due to the 2012 mining ban and, with mining stopping again, they will once again not be able to do. “If the government is not able to start mining, then it should repay their (mining dependants’) loans,” he said.
