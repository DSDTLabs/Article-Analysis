AGRA: In a bid to ensure door-to-door garbage collection,   (AMC) has divided the city into five zones. The new   plan has already been implemented in one zone. For the remaining four zones, four different companies are being tasked to manage   in an organized way, civic body officials said.
 
  Door–to-door garbage collection is the main component of waste management under the Swachh Bharat Mission, the officials said. For this, a decentralized plan has been developed. Five private companies will manage door-to-door garbage collection. The plan is aimed at improving maintenance of   and hygiene in the city.
  
  Giving details, AMC executive engineer Sanjeev Pradhan said, “The city has been divided into five parts for proper monitoring of cleanliness works. In Tajganj zone, a private company, Urba Associates, has already started door-to-door garbage collection. Four different firms will soon start collecting garbage in the remaining four zones — Hariparwat, Lohamandi, Shahganj and Chatta.” The civic body aims to implement the plan in the other zones from April 1.
  
  There are 100 municipal wards in the city. According to a senior AMC official, earlier also a door-to-door garbage collection system was implemented. But it failed to produce desired results as it was centralized. The company,  , which was given the contact was not able to arrange required resources and manage manpower. Proper monitoring of sanitation and hygiene situation in the city was a big challenge. Therefore, centralized system was discontinued and a plan was prepared to divide the city in five parts to manage door-to-door garbage collection. The five companies would be able to arrange all the required resources more easily and be able to deliver effectively, he added.
