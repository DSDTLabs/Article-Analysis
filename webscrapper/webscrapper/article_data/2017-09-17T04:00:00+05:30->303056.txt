Vadodara: Investigations in the cash-for-marks scam of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) have revealed that the co-accused Dhruvin Shah, who was arrested by the agency on Thursday, used to run a consultancy website for providing admissions to students not only at Sumandeep Vidyapeeth but other universities in the country.

 ACB officials said that Shah admitted that along with the complainantâ€™s daughter he helped four other students to get admission at Sumandeep Vidyapeeth by taking money in the name of donation apart from other fees. ACB sources said that Shah told them that he used to get consultancy fees from other colleges of the country for getting students for admissions.
 
 ACB is trying to know if he was getting similar fees from Sumandeep Vidyapeeth too. On Saturday, as his custody ended, the court extended his custody by one more day after the agency sought further custody for seven days.
