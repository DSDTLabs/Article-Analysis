PATNA: Two separate petitions were filed against BJP president   and party MP   in the court of chief judicial magistrate, Muzaffarpur, on Thursday for their recent controversial statements.

 While Shah, in his maiden speech in the  , had said even selling pakodas was a form of self-employment and job creation, Katiyar had stirred the hornet’s nest by saying that Muslims should leave India as they divided the nation on the basis of population.
 
 The petition against Shah was filed by one Tamanna Hashmi and the one against Katiyar by M Raju Naiyyar.
 
 In his petition, Hashmi stated that Shah’s remark had created “inferiority complex” among the youths in the country. “What is the point of pursuing education if one has to sell pakodas? Shah’s statement was an insult to the country’s educated youths,” Hashmi said.
 
 Naiyyar, on the other hand, raised objections to Katiyar’s “provocative” statement, saying it had hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims in the country. “Such remarks may lead to communal violence in the country,” he said.
 
 Katiyar’s remark had come after AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi’s statement in   on Tuesday that the Centre should enact a law to punish those terming Muslims as “Pakistanis”.
 
 The case against Shah will now come up for hearing on February 28 and the one against Katiyar on March 8.
