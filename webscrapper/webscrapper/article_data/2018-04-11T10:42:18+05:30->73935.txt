It led the Sattur police to register a case against him. He did not disclose this in his passport application.
 
 The regional passport authority issued a notice to him on January 9 directing him to explain within 30 days why he had suppressed the information. Challenging it, he filed a writ.
 
 The assistant solicitor general had argued that once the case was registered, the petitioner was obliged to disclose the said fact. He was aware of the said fact but did not disclose the said material fact and in the light of Sections 10(a), 10
 
 (2)(b) and 10(3)(b) of the Passport Act, 1967, was not entitled to get the passport, he said. But, the bench said, “Mere pendency of FIR proceedings cannot be construed as pendency of criminal proceedings. Admittedly, in the case on hand, the case is in FIR stage and even for the sake of arguments, subsequently, the chargesheet has been filed, as on the date of submission of the application for passport, only FIR is pending and it cannot be construed as pendency of a criminal case and it cannot be said that the petitioner has suppressed the material fact of pendency of the criminal case.”
 
 It then directed the regional passport officer to process the passport application in accordance with law.
