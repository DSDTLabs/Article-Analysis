NAGPUR: Rahstriya Adivasi Sangharsh Samrajya Sanghatana On Tuesday announced that it will boycott candidates of all political parties who will contest in the   elections this month. In a press meet at Patrakar Bhavan, organization’s national president   said, “All parties that come to power after every election have neglected all tribal communities.”

 Bhalavi claims the current state government has failed to address the issue of children dying due to malnutrition and child sexual abuse in government and semi-government run schools. “Even though article 46 of the Indian Constitution stipulates the state must pay attention to education and economic welfare of tribal communities this government has done nothing,” he said.
 
 According to Bhalavi, neglect on government’s part has led to students and members of the community to protest in front the   time and again. “Were at the government’s behest and being treated like slaves.” he said.
