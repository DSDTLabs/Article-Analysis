AMARAVATI : A technical glitch in the Comprehensive   (CMFS), the new   introduced by the state government, has caused severe disturbances this month in the disbursement of salary of employees working in the various aided societies run by the government.

We will be taking up this issue with the finance Secretariat on Monday,”  , president of the AP government employees’ Joint Action Committee, told TOI. There are 100 such aided societies which employ about 15,000 people.
 
 Sources said the technical glitch happened during the data transfer from the regular platform to CFMS which was introduced in the state in   is the new transfer IT platform that connects with the Reserve Bank of India for fund distribution.
 
 “The glitches included some employees getting paid twice while some others did not get their March salary at all,” an employee of the finance department told TOI on condition of anonymity. However officials made it clear that the disruption is due to the technical glitch and not due to any cash crunch. Also hit due to the glitch were various other payments.
