I heard a   and was wondering what the fuss was all about when my colleagues shouted that there was fire on the third floor. Some among us tried to rush to the terrace as the stairs had been blanked by thick smoke. But door to the terrace was found locked. 
 
 It was impossible to go down taking the stairs. One of us pressed the button of the lift since it was still operational. I knew it was risky to take the lift. But it was not safe to stay back either. It was a do-or-die situation and I had no choice. I stepped into the lift with other workers.
 
 The tension inside the lift was palpable. I closed my eyes and was praying that the lift did not stop mid-way. Finally, we reached the ground floor. Once the lift door opened, we ran out of the building to safety. It was a close shave. I am still shaky and it will take days for me to recover from the trauma.
