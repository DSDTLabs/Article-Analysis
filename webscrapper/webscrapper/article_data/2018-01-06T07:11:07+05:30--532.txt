PUNE: A man was arrested on Thursday night for duping dog lovers in five states, including Maharashtra, interested in purchasing puppies online.

 The cybercrime cell took Rajan Jagannath Sharma (21) into custody after receiving 10 complaint applications against him. Sharma, having his roots in Kolkata, was staying in a rental accommodation at Aundh for the past three months. 
 
 Besides pet lovers of the state, he duped people from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Kerala.
 
 Sharma was handed over to the   police after the first FIR was lodged by homemaker  , a resident of NIBM Road. Two more FIRs were lodged against him with the   and Yerawada police on Friday.
 
 A Nigerian national had duped Sharma of Rs 8,000 on the pretext of selling him a puppy online. He replicated the modus operandi.
 
 The conman posted photographs of puppies of high pedigree on e-commerce website. Dog lovers contacted him over phone and through cellphone messaging service. He induced them to deposit money in his bank accounts, but did not deliver puppies. The fraud came to light after he refused to repay money and blocked the clients’ numbers. 
 
 The cyber cell’s inspector,  , told TOI, “Sharma’s involvement was initially confirmed in three cases after we conducted technical investigations and verified his bank account records. Sharma’s phone records show that he has duped between 30 and 40 dog lovers in five states.”
 
 She said, “Sharma holds a bachelors’ degree in commerce. We have seized two smartphones, a laptop, a dongle and two debit cards from him,” she added.
