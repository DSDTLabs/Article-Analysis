 A special team led by inspector Anjum Bagwan under assistant commissioner of police (Wanowrie division) Milind Patil arrested the suspects following a tip-off. Deputy commissioner of police (zone IV) Deepak Sakore had issued instructions to the team to crack down on criminals involved in   vehicles and disposing them of in Pune and Ahmednagar districts among other places after investigations revealed that local criminals were not involved in the series of vehicle thefts in the city.
