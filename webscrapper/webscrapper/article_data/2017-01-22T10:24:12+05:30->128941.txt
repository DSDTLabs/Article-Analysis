NADALA (BHOLATH): With the rival parties and Sikh organizations raising the issue of sacrilege of   at Bargari in 2015, chief minister   also responded on Saturday by recalling Operation Blue Star.

 Addressing a public meeting in Nadala in Bholath constituency in support of SAD candidate and former SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur’s son-in-law  , he said that even Bir of Guru Granth Sahib at sanctum sanctorum in Darbar Sahib was pierced with bullets and the water in the Sarovar there turned red with blood of the devotees. “I don’t know what animosity the Congress has been nursing against Sikhs. Its governments always discriminated against Sikhs and Punjab and committed atrocities on us,” the CM said while going in details about Operation Blue Star.
 
 After attacking the Congress on Army action at Golden Temple in June 1984, Badal then targeted AAP too. “They put their poll symbol broom on picture of Darbar Sahib. They not only insulted the central place of Sikhs which was being revered by all but also hurt religious sentiments by comparing their manifesto with Guru Granth Sahib, Gita and Quran,” Badal said.
 
 Turning towards issue of SYL, Badal said that earlier the Congress worked against interests of Punjab and now Kejriwal also following the same line. The CM even cited a line from Gurbani which mentions water as father. “Now how can we tolerate if someone attacks our father,” he said while referring to the river water sharing issue.
 
 SAD patriarch also mentioned the Valmiki Tirath at Amritsar and Guru Ravidass memorial at Khuralgarh, Hoshiarpur to claim that his government took care of all sections. He also cited the other memorials pertaining to Sikh history.
