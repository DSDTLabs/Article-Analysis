MUMBAI: A   for the ambitious Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR) project has been completed and it has been decided to construct a five-km tunnel under the   (SGNP). The cost of the project, pegged at Rs 1,300 crore in 2012, is now estimated to be Rs 2,000 crore. 

 The GMLR project, proposed as an east-west link to reduce traffic congestion, will begin from the Western Express Highway (WEH) and end at LBS Marg, Mulund.
 
 In mid-2016, the BMC sought permission from the SGNP authorities for a geo-technical investigation to check the feasibility of constructing a tunnel. The SGNP authorities denied permission fearing such a survey might affect the habitat around the national park. 
 
 But the BMC later obtained permission from the state government for the survey. Additional municipal commissioner Dr Sanjay Mukherjee said, “We have now completed the geo-technical survey and will put up the proposal for clearance from the forest department. It would be a six-lane tunnel between Film City in   to   (Bhandup). The GMLR project is as per schedule and we plan to begin the tunnel work from next year.” 
 
 In 2012 when the project was initially proposed it was estimated to cost Rs 1,300 crore, however the cost now, including the tunnel, is estimated to be Rs 2,000 crore. A provision of Rs 300 crore for the project was made in the civic budget of 2015-16 and Rs 130 crore was proposed in the civic budget of the year 2016-17. However, with this tunnel being proposed, sources said the cost of the project may rise further. 
 
 Earlier, there were issues with the project’s alignment as it proposed an elevated road. A total of 2,224 trees were expected to get affected due to it—696 trees from Aarey Colony and 1,528 trees from Bhandup Waterworks Complex. It was also passing through land allotted for a water treatment plant to be set up for water supply projects off  . Officials had then said it would mean killing the prospects of one project for the sake of another.
