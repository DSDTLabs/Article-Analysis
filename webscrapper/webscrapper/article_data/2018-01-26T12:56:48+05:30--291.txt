PANAJI: In a bid to provide affordable taxi services in Goa, the state-run   (KTCL) is looking to appoint a consultant to explore and study the possibility of starting an app-based taxi service in the state. “We had a board meeting today and have decided to appoint a consultant for   cabs. We are going to visualise this concept first and then decide. It will be an app-based service,” chairman   said.

 “These will most likely be nine to 10-seater mini taxis and will have a GPS tracking system,” general manager   said.
 
 On Thursday, KTCL’s first 100% electric bus arrived in Goa for a trial run. The electric bus is said to offer zero-emission and better acceleration compared to fuel-run buses. “The chief minister will declare details about the same on January 30,” Almeida said. He also hinted at the possibility of starting ferry services.
