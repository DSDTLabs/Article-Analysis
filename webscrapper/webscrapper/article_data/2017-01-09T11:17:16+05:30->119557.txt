HYDERABAD: An   approached police stating her husband was abducted by two unidentified persons from their residence in Nallakunta on Sunday. 

 Police said Suguna, wife of Upender, 45, in her complaint, claimed two men wearing monkey caps, came to their house. As Upender was talking to them, they whisked him away, she said. At the time of filing this report, police were yet to trace the cab driver, who reportedly took Rs 2 lakh loan from a financier, Shanker.
 
 “We questioned Shanker and he claimed that he had not sent anyone. He claimed several people owe him bigger amounts. It appears that Shanker had no role in the abduction,”   Mahendar Reddy said.
