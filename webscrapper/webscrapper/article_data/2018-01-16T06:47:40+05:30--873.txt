KOLKATA: Copenhagen airport, with two parallel runways similar to Kolkata, manages 83 flights per hour, which is more than twice Kolkata’s capacity (35 per hour). If Copenhagen   can do it, why can’t Kolkata? 

 That is the poser that haunted Danish aviation experts as they went about examining in detail how the airport functions. A team of four from Copenhagen airport, led by  , on Monday scampered across the airport to see where and how the operations could be made more efficient so that Kolkata could pack in more flights.
 
 “Kolkata airport has enough space for expanding the terminal and doubling passenger capacity. But that can be utilised only if the airport can accommodate more flights, particularly during busy hours,” explained regional executive director (east) KL Sharma.
 
 
  
 It was during the visit to Copenhagen airport that   chairman   was struck by the similarities between two airports and the sharp difference in the number of flights the two airports handle. That is how   was conceived.
 
 “The Danish team, along with AAI officials from Delhi and Kolkata, are observing and taking note of various bottlenecks in the runway, taxiways and parking bays. They wanted to check out the busy traffic hour. We have shown them recording of radar operations but they wish to see it live and hence they will follow the terminal traffic on Tuesday morning. Though a concrete solution for more flights will probably come in later, we expect to get some suggestions from the team on Tuesday,” said Kolkata airport general manager (ATM) BK Sarkar.
