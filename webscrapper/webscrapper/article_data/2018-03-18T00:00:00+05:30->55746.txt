It’s been a journey of over five years, and director   is dealing with mixed emotions as his conclusion to the   series released on Friday. Happy with the response that the final film of his trilogy has received, Srinivas tells us that he is not worried about all the threats and the criticism that he has received over the years.

 Speaking about the recently-released ‘III’, that is produced by Ram Talluri, he says, “With this film, there were two things that I had to face. One, was the overall criticism, which was people question if such a film is required in the first place. To that, I say that there was this story that I had come across and I wanted the world to know about it. The second thing I was questioned about was the need to have three parts to the film. I was clear that this tale had to be told in as many parts, and having faith in my vision, I went ahead and executed it in the way I thought best. The result, in the way of the positive review that I have got, have reassured me of that decision” says Srinivas.
 
 While the director is happy that his tale has reached its conclusion, it is an emotional farewell for him. “It’s fairly easy to disconnect with most films, but since my journey with Dandupalya has been a long one, there is relief and some pain while bidding adieu to it. I have enjoyed every bit of this journey. All the actors — be it  ,  ,   or P Ravi Shankar — will all be recognised for their work in this film, as will the technicians,” Srinivas adds.
