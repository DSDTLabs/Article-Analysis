Posing as senior defence and district administration officers,   officials are contacting Indian officials to gather information on troop deployment along the border, the government said in reply to a   question on Wednesday.

 “Pakistani intelligence agencies used to call up officials of post offices, railways, state revenue (patwaris), schools,   and public representatives, etc,” he said, adding that the officials are regularly sensitised not to pass on information inadvertently.
