 PMC will construct 103 overhead tanks. The tenders for building these 82 tanks have been issued. They are part of the 24x7 water supply project. The estimated cost of this initiative is Rs 245 crore.

 The meeting also reviewed the riverfront development, Bhama Askhed project, flyovers, development plan for merged villages, social welfare scheme, building of toilets in the core city areas and Metro work.
