NEW DELHI: The   on Sunday organised a “Vikas Yatra” in all 70   of Delhi to highlight the “good work” done by the government in the last three years. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, along with ministers of his cabinet and MLAs, interacted with people in their respective constituencies.

 The move came amid a possibility of bypolls in the city following the disqualification of 20 AAP MLAs in an alleged office-of-profit case. While interacting with people in his New Delhi constituency, Kejriwal said he would meet people from Monday to Friday at 10am at his residence without appointment.
 
 The CM said: “So far, we have done half of work we could have done in the last three years because they (the Centre and LG) are creating hurdles in our every file ... Keep your faith in us.” The AAP government will complete three years on February 14. AAP MLAs — including the recently disqualified ones — organised road shows and interacted with people on the measures taken by the government. 
 
 “The city’s power tariff is the lowest in the country. Revolutionary work has been done in the health and education sectors. There will be one mohalla clinic at every kilometre in the next seven months,” Kejriwal said. “Soon, all services will be delivered at your doorstep. You won’t need to go anywhere for caste, income certificates, etc. All you need to do is make a call and a government executive will come to your house to give you certificates,” he claimed. 
 
 On the home delivery of ration scheme, Kejriwal said: “Soon, people won’t have to queue up outside ration shops. The government will deliver packed ration at their doorsteps.”
 
 Development minister Gopal Rai also organised a “Vikas Yatra” and apprised people in Babarpur constituency of the work done by the government. Other cabinet ministers in the AAP government, including transport minister Kailash Gahlot and social welfare minister Rajender Pal Gautam, also interacted with people.
