Shimla: Observing that Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board had kept its eyes shut to violations by hoteliers in Kasauli area of Solan district, National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the department of town and country planning (DTCP) and state pollution control board to discharge their statutory function. The tribunal asked the two to ensure that there is no violation of law leading to environment and ecological degradation of the area, particularly when hotels are constructed illegaly and operating without consent .

 Tribunal Principal Bench headed by its chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar observed that the report filed by the committee constituted under its order revealed that 11 hotels were built illegaly in the vicinity of Kasauli area.
 
 “There are instances where plans were sanctioned for a limited purpose but they have been flagrantly violated. Like for example, in one of the hotel seven rooms were sanctioned but 50 have been constructed,” it said.
 
 The tribunal further observed that Himachal Pradesh Pollution Control Board appears to have ignored the “severe violation that is likely to arise in these hotels which are operating without consent (of the board)”.
 
 It said show cause notice has been issued to these hotels as to why appropriate directions have not issued against them, including for their closure as well as why they be not directed to pay environmental compensation. 
 
 The bench also directed to file their replies to the show cause within 10 days. “In the event of no reply, we shall proceed to hear the matter on merit and decide the same in accordance with law,” it added.
 
 The tribunal had directed the state government to inform it whether any sewerage system exist in these areas or not. If not, what is the manner of disposal of sewage and effluent in these areas. It asked pollution control board to file detailed affidavit within 10 days.
