Singers  ,   and Charan were on a show in Seattle in LA last weekend.

 Apparently, the artistes received a legal notice for performing the songs of Ilaiyaraaja at the programme, a few days ago. SP shared the news about the same on his online page, recently. "Couple of days back, an Attorney representing Shri.Iliayaraaja, sent legal notices to me, Smt.Chithra, Charan, organisers of the concerts in different cities and the managements of all the venues, which says that we are not supposed to perform compositions of Shri.Iliayaraja without his permission, if so, it is breaking the copyright law and have to pay huge financial penalties and face legal action. Let me say, I am ignorant of these legalities."
 
  says that it's his son who designed this world tour, titled SPB50, and he wasn't aware of such a law. "We kick-started this concert tour in August in Toranto, then we performed in Russia, Srilanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Dubai and did lots of shows in India too. I did not get any feelers from Shri. Raja's office at that time. I don't know why now when we started our US tour. As I said earlier, I am ignorant of the law. If it is a law, so be it and I obey it."
 
 In these circumstances, the troupe cannot perform Raja's compositions from to day. "But the show should happen.By God's grace I have sung lots of other composer's songs too which we will present. Hope you all will bless our concerts as usual.I am always grateful for your love and affection.
 I only request you all not to have any harsh opinions and discussions regarding this. If this is the design of God, I obey it with reverence.
 Sarvejanah Sukhinobhavanthu," says the singer.
