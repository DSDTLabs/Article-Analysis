 Billie Lourd has thanked her friends for their support following the deaths of her mother   and grandmother  . 

  
  
 The 'Scream Queens' actress shared a picture of her friends, including rumored boyfriend Taylor Lautner, in onesies on   along with a shutout thanking them for their support following the passing of the ' : The Force Awakens' star. 
 
 Fisher passed away in December after suffering a heart attack on a flight from London to Los Angeles - and Debbie died a day after Carrie from a stroke. 
 
 Alongside the photo, Billie wrote: "This group of onesie clad supremely supportive humans (and many others #notpicturedbutinthepicture) are the kings and queens of my world #greatefulfortheirgreatness #friendsfindingthefunny (sic)." 
 
  
  
 It comes weeks after the 24-year-old beauty posted a heartfelt throwback picture tribute to her late mother. 
 
 Billie shared a quote by the Hollywood legend and said that she will keep her mother's voice 'forever' in her head and heart as she taught her so much. 
 
 Alongside a picture of a young Billie in the back of a car with her mother, she wrote on the photo-sharing app: "If my life weren't funny then it would just be true and that is unacceptable - Finding the funny might take a while but I learned from the best and her voice will forever be in my head and in my heart (sic)."
