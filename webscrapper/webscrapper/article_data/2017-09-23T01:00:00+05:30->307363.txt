ARA: An 18-year-old boy was shot dead by motorcycle-borne criminals in an alleged gang war near Sarathuan village under Udwant Nagar police station on Bhojpur district late on Thursday evening.

 SHO of Udwant Nagar police station said prima facie the murder seems to be the fallout of a gang war between notorious Butan Choudhary and his rival Ranjit Choudhary of Belaur village. The victim, Amarjeet Choudhary, was allegedly a member of the Butan Choudhary gang. The criminals pumped six bullets into Amarjeet’s body, killing him on the spot.
 
 Police sources said several persons have been killed in the bloody battle for supremacy between the Butan Choudhary and the Ranjit Choudhary gangs over the last few years. The victims include Ranjit’s brother Hemant Choudhary and former mukhiya Champa Devi. While Butan is lodged in Ara jail, Ranjit is serving jail sentence in a Patna jail.
