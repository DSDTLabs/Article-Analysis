 A resident of the village, Rangamma Markhale, 80, said: “Tuesdays have been like a curse for our village for decades. I don’t know why it happens but whenever we do any new work on Tuesday, it turns out badly. A couple of years ago, some of went to celebrate the tenth day of   on a Tuesday. That day, a 10-year-old girl who went to fetch water from an open well drowned in it.”
 
 Another senior citizen of the village, Baburao Rajole, said: “We believe that bad things will happen in this village if anyone starts some new work on Tuesdays. So we never do it. Christian and Muslims too don’t celebrate their festivals if they fall on Tuesday — they do it a day before or the day after.”
 
 Another villager Ashok Shirse said a decade ago, a man called Ramesh Bukka died of snakebite on Tuesday when Nagarapanchami fell on a Tuesday.
