NAGPUR: For the third time in five years   (DKM) cagers stamped their authority in city’s basketball circuit by emerging champions in the   in both the boys and girls’ section on late Saturday evening.

 
 Having captured both the U-16 crowns in 2012, the boys and girls teams of DKM repeated their act in the Junior (U-18) district championship in 2013 and on a pleasantly cool Saturday evening the Shankar Nagar-based club once again underlined their supremacy by pocketing twin titles and emerge as the Nagpur District champions in the (U-18) selection meet.
 
 Action at the   (NASA) courts in Surendra Nagar saw the boys and girls’ teams of DKM, donning grey and black outfits, take their archrivals   (SNG) in stride in both the sections.
 
 While DKM girls surprised defending champions SNG 49-45, their boy’s counterparts recorded a facile 70-54 triumph.
 
 Playing perfectly with the plan set by DKM coach Dhiraj Kadao, city’s best two forwards Shreya Dandekar and Saurabh Mankar led from the front and scored more than half the points netted by their respective teams to bring home the glory.
 
 While Shreya fired 33 of the 49 points scored by DKM against SNG, Saurabh contributed 40 of the 70 baskets in the boy’s final.
 
 In an exciting girls’ summit clash, DKM rallied splendidly and played a powerful last quarter to upset holders SNG by four points (49-45). The quarter-wise progress for the winners read 7-7, 10-16, 13-11, 19-11 with Shreya scoring a game-high 33 points and Dhara Phate (10) playing a pivotal role.
 
 In contrast in the lop-sided boy’s title clash, Saurabh fired a game-high 40 points as an attacking play from DKM gave them an easy 16-point triumph.
