CHENNAI: AIADMK members siding with   O Panneerselvam said that there are at least five fence-sitters who are targets for a change of heart. Prominent among them is Mylapore MLA R Nataraj. Since Wednesday, the former city police commissioner has been keeping a low profile and has not been seen in public.

 This led to many residents of Mylapore petitioning him to take action and side with O Panneerselvam. Residents also started a social media campaign, "Where is my missing MLA?" to try and locate Nataraj.
 
 Multiple visits to his office and inquiries with his staff and locals seem to suggest that the MLA had not stepped into his office in the last three days.
 
 In a Facebook post, the MLA’s post said, "I am not anywhere else as has been wrongfully claimed by a few people in social media. I am sure you all know about me by now and I would never take a break from discharging my duties towards Mylapore. I would also like to clarify as regards my duties as an MLA vis-a-vis the current situation."
 
 His Facebook post got more than 2,800 likes, 270 shares and 550 comments -- most urging the MLA to join the Panneerselvam camp. On Sunday, TN School Education Minister K Pandiarajan visited the reluctant MLA at his residence to convince him to take a stance.
 
 After a sumptuous lunch at the former city police commissioner’s house, Pandiarajan said, "He is a long-time friend. So, I took the liberty of meeting him at his residence.”
 
 Though the AIADMK MLA till date has maintained his neutral stance on the issue, “I have invited him to lend his support to chief minister O Panneerselvam. I hope he will take a positive decision," the minister said.
 
 "There are many more elected representatives who want to wait and watch. My message to them would be when there is dharma and adharma, one must always take the side of dharma," said Pandiarajan.
