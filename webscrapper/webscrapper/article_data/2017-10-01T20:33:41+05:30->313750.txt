THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: When a woman turned up to check on her seventy-year-old father with whom she had not spoken for four months, she found much to her horror, his skeleton lying on the sofa in his two-storied house at medical college here on Sunday. 

 The police said that the body of K P Radhakrishnan, a retired tutor at Dental college was found in almost fully decomposed state inside his house. He had been living alone in his house at old medical college road after his relationship with his daughter and wife became strained owing to differences over some domestic affairs. 
 
 His daughter, a PG medical student who was married to a doctor lived along with her mother at Kottayam. Radhakrishnan and his wife Ambika had been living separately for the past few years since the marriage of their daughter. Occasionally they would talk over the phone and according to police they had last spoken to each other four months ago. Recently Radhakrishnan's daughter had come to visit her father but returned after finding that the door was locked. 
 
 On Sunday, they had come to visit him again only to find unattended set of bills and letters on the doorstep. The medical college police was informed about the missing case. Later police broke the door and found the body in decomposed state on the sofa. 
 
 Medical college police SHO Girilal B said that Radhakrishnan lived a secluded life and barely spoke to anyone. The entire compound was overgrown with shrubs and the house was in an abandoned state.
 
 The body was released to relatives after completing inquest and post-mortem. The police have registered a case of unnatural death and are probing all angles.
