PUNE: The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation ( ) is confident of laying the foundations for pillars on the Mutha riverside road before the onset of monsoon. 

  
  
 
 MahaMetro has planned 59 pillars on this stretch, between Deccan Gymkhana and  . Of these, officials said, foundations for 17 were nearly ready, and the rest will be completed by the end of June. 
 
 The riverside stretch is part of the elevated Vanaz to   line, which passes through Paud Road and Karve Road, crosses Deccan Gymkhana and enters the riverbed near Garware high school. The route will proceed along the river till Congress Bhavan. 
 
 Of the 59 foundations, around 30 will have piles to protect the sewage chambers on the road. The structures will leave enough space to take up repairs and maintenance of the chambers without disturbing the pillars’ foundations.
 
 MahaMetro has also said the civil work will continue even during the monsoon. Work will be halted only during heavy showers or when water is being discharged into the river. “Continuous, heavy rainfall is seen in the city on very few days. So we feel that the work can continue even during the monsoon, except when there are heavy showers,” a MahaMetro official said.
 
 Officials further they plan to extend the civil work on Karve Road by the end of this month. “Foundations are being laid near Garware college and work in the second phase, up to Swatantrya chowk, will begin in 15 days,” an official said.
 
 So far, MahaMetro said, about 60 foundations were ready and work on 21 pillars is underway on the Vanaz to   route.
