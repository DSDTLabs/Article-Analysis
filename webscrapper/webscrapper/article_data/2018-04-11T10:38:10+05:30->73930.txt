CHENNAI:   (AMMK) founder T T V Dhinakaran has urged chief minister   to lead an all-party delegation to meet Prime Minister   after the Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to file a draft plan on setting up a   by May 3.

 “The Centre had earlier failed to do anything concrete in the six weeks it was given. Now the Supreme Court has given it time till May 3. Having failed earlier in mounting enough pressure on the Centre, EPS should at least now put pressure on the Centre for definite action on the Cauvery by leading an all-party delegation to meet the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister once again refuses to meet, the chief minister should bring it to the open,” he told reporters here on Tuesday.
