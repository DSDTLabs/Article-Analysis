SHILLONG: The model code of conduct has come into force in the   district with the announcement of by-election to the the   (ST) legislative assembly constituency on May 28. South district magistrate H D B   promulgated Section 144 of the CrPC prohibiting unlawful activities in the constituency to ensure free and fair polls. 

 Any activity, which would be in violation of the model code of conduct-as in giving or receiving bribes or gratification for exercising electoral right, carrying of arms or other lethal weapons and use of government or individual property, premises, land and building for banners and posters by political parties or candidates during the poll process-would invite censure from the Election Commission of India. "The prohibitory order comes into force with immediate effect in the entire district and shall remain in force until further order," an official statement said. The counting of votes will take place on May 31.
 
 The Ampati assembly seat fell vacant following the resignation of former chief minister  , who won from Ampati and Songsak constituencies in the February 27assembly polls. "The date of issue of gazette notification is May 3, the last date of nomination is May 10, the date for scrutiny of nomination is May 11, the last date for withdrawal of candidature is May 14 and the date before which election will be completed is June 2," an EC notification said.
 
 "The commission has decided to use EVMs and VVPATs in all polling stations. There will be enough EVMs and VVPATs and steps will be taken to ensure the polls are conducted smoothly," an election department official said.
 
 Considered the bastion of the former chief minister, there are whispers that Congress may field Mukul Sangma's daughter Miani Shira in Ampati.
