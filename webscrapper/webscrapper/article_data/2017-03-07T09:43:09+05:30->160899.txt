JAIPUR: After 10 years of logjam and several technical stalemates, the   (SCRB) began the operation of its much awaited Crime and Criminal Tracking Network & Systems ( ) from Monday. The software aims to keep a digitized record of FIRs and charge sheets at centralised software which will be accessible to all 861 police stations across the state.

 On Monday, as many as 24 police stations of Jaipur police were connected with the CCTNS. Additional commissioner of police (First) Prafull Kumar said training was given to cops after which 24 police stations were connected with the CCTNS.
 
 “All the records of a criminal, right from the registration of FIR to evidence and filing of charge sheet will be made available online. The police will not have to wait for eons to get the details about the criminal record of an accused,” Kumar said.
 
 The IT enabled integrated data system will help police digitize lengthy crime records, FIRs and database of criminals that will help investigation officers to expedite investigations.
 
 Sharat Kaviraj, SP (SCRB), who was part of the team that developed CCTNS for   police, said that by March-end all police stations of the state would be connected with the CCTNS.
 
 “Rajasthan police’s CCTNS will have several important features like E-FIR. Also, permission for events, protests, performance and verifications of employees and tenants could be done through the new software,” Kaviraj told TOI.
 
 While other states have already rolled out their CCTNS several years ago, the two states - Rajasthan and Bihar lagged behind in the development of their projects.
 
 “If a particular police station in some remote corner of the state arrests some suspects, then cops can match the details with the database available on CCTNS. CCTNS will give the complete criminal history of the suspects,” an official said.
