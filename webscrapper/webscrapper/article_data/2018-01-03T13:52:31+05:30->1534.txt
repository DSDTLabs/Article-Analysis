TRICHY: A total of 35 people sustained injuries in perhaps the first official   of the season held in   district on Tuesday. Over 600 bulls participated in the event at   village which was also unique in that there were no rewards for the winners. 

 It is customary of jallikattu events to reward successful bull tamers and bull owners. But in the absence of these awards, a cut-throat competition was not in view, perhaps one reason why the casualties were relatively less. Pudukkottai, which is known for organising the maximum number of jallikattu events in the state, is also the district where more number of tamers lost their lives last year. 
 
 “The absence of prizes was in a way demoralising for the participants as the bull tamers were not forthcoming enough knowing that they wouldn’t get anything risking their life and displaying their valour,” said a spectator. When asked, an organiser said that prizes were one among the reasons for casualties in a jallikattu. Casualties occurred when the tamers went after ferocious bulls which came with a big bounty. 
 
 The organizers however managed to bring over 600 jallikattu bulls, especially some of the famous ones, for which they bore the expenses. Jallikattu bulls were brought from places including Pudukkottai, Trichy, Sivagangai,  , Karaikudi and Dindigul. 
 
 Speaking to the media during the event, health minister   said that jallikattu had started on a positive note this season. “All precautionary measures were taken during the event which was organized as per court directions. Safety of the players was given top priority which helped minimise the injuries,” he said. Two of the 35 bull tamers who were injured in the event were referred to Thanjavur medical college for treatment.
