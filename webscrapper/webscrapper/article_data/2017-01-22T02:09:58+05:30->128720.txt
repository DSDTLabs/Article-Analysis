NOIDA: With Bollywood actor   pitching in for his brother Shriram Yadav’s   (SSP), the UP assembly election campaign holds out the promise of a high entertainment quotient. Stating that the   will fight in at least 390 out of the total 403 assembly constituencies, Rajpal Yadav on Saturday released a list of 50 candidates.

 Claiming that the SSP aims to convert rajneeti (politics) into nitiraj (policy rule), he released a 47-point agenda for the 2017 UP election which includes promises like improving policing, transfer of government officials in keeping with public opinion, and creation of a ‘film city’ across 3,000 acres in Bundelkhand.
 
 Rajpal Yadav told TOI that he would address a gathering in Noida in the run-up to the election. Maintaining his on-screen flamboyant and humorous style, he said the party would contest the general election in 2019. He said that this time, the tyre (party symbol) would run on the roads of UP to rule the hearts of the people.
 
 Saying that he would play the role of Hanuman in SSP, Rajpal said that his brother Shriram, who had founded SSP, would be the chief ministerial candidate of the party.
 
 The party has declared candidates in four of the total eight assembly constituencies in   and Ghaziabad.
 
 While Javed Khan is the candidate for Noida, Anil Bhati will fight from Dadri, Sanjay Tyagi from Loni and Kiran Sharma from Ghaziabad. Kuldeep Yadav, who is former leader of SP’s youth wing in Noida, has joined SSP and is currently the party’s national secretary.
