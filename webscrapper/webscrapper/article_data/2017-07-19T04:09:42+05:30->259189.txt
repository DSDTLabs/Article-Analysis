Gurgaon: Nearly 300 workers took out a protest march on Tuesday to mark the fifth year of labour unrest at Maruti Suzuki’s Manesar plant.

 The protesters, including members of worker unions from  , Honda Motors,  , AITUC and CITU, gathered at   around 4 pm and protested for nearly one and a half hours against the conviction of 31 employees, 13 of whom were sentenced to life imprisonment.
 
 The workers then marched from Rajiv Chowk to Mini Secretariat, where they handed over a memorandum to the deputy commissioner. 
 
 On July 18, 2012, a mob tore through the Manesar plant of Maruti Suzuki, smashing property and setting parts of the factory on fire. General manager Awanish Kumar Dev was charred to death after he was set on fire in a conference room.
 
 But the workers alleged that Dev died of asphyxiation and was not set on fire. “We want a fair inquiry into the case,” said Kuldeep Janghu, general secretary of Maruti Suzuki Workers Union.
 
 The workers also claimed that the company used the opportunity to sacked 546 permanent and around 1,800 contractual workers. While some 214 workers were initially made accused in the case, 148 workers were put behind bars.
 
 In March 2017, the sessions court held 31 workers guilty and sentenced 13 of them to life in jail and acquitted 117 workers.
 
 Of the 18 others who were convicted of rioting but not murder, four were jailed for five years. The remaining 14 were given three-year jail terms but released from Bhondsi jail after paying fines of Rs 2,000 each as they had already spent that time in prison.
