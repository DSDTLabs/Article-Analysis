PUNE: About 188 cases of heat-related illnesses — heat exhaustion, heatstroke, heat rash — have been recorded in the state between March and May 7 this year, the state health department’s data revealed. With most of May and June still to go, the figure is only expected to rise.

  
  
 
 As many as 114 cases have been reported from heatwave-affected Nagpur, Yavatmal, Latur, Buldhana, Nanded and Jalgaon among others. Most of these places are in the   region.
 
 State surveillance officer Pradip Awate said most of the cases are from the Nagpur corporation (102) followed by Nagpur district (14). “We have not received any case from Pune. Barring the one heatstroke-related death in Amaravati, most heat stroke cases till May 7 were minor. Heatstroke can be a critical condition and often requires hospitalization. It can also lead to death,” the official said.
 
 A state disaster management authority official said heatwave advisories have been issued to the districts, with do’s and don’ts as well as precautions to be taken by people during intense heatwaves. 
 
 “When the India Meteorological Department issues heatwave warning, we pass on the information to the talukas,” he said. Another official added there were unconfirmed reports of two heat-related deaths in Jalgaon. He said it was difficult to confirm the cause of deaths.
 
 Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority ( ) conducted a meeting with 17 heatwave-prone states, including Maharashtra, on Saturday, to review their preparedness and mitigation measures.
