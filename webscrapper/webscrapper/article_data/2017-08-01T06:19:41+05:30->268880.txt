CHANDIGARH: The agency responsible to give compensation to rape survivors has run out of funds at a time when the   to a 10-year-old   has set off discussions over the need of a rehabilitation policy.

 “We have no funds to give to rape survivors under the Victim Compensation Scheme. Earlier, the maximum compensation to be granted was Rs 3 lakh. Now, it has been enhanced to Rs 10 lakh. But the administration has not released any funds. I have written to officials to give money,” said  , member secretary, State Legal Services Authority, Chandigarh.
 
 The authority was supposed to grant compensation of Rs 31 lakh to four rape survivors. It has managed to pay Rs 23 lakh. The rest of the amount is yet to be given. Mahavir Singh said, “We could no release Rs 8 lakh owing to shortage of funds.”
 
 On the compensation to be given to the 10-year-old rape survivor, Mahavir Singh said, “Interim relief can be granted before the conviction if the family puts in an application in a court. We can grant Rs 10 lakh but right now our financial condition does not allow it.”
 
 The TOI had earlier reported that the authority had written a letter to home secretary asking to release funds in a particular case in which Rs 1 lakh was to be granted to a rape survivor as per the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court.
 
 Home secretary  , when contacted, said the issue could be looked into but funds are at the disposal of the State Legal Services Authority. “The authority is provisioned to have funds at its own disposal to grant compensation. However, we will look into the issue and ensure that no victim suffers.”
