GAYA: Suspected activists of Trtitiya Prastuti Committee, a splinter group of CPI (Maoist), on Sunday night raided the construction site of GAIL, the agency engaged in laying gas pipeline passing through Gurua police station area of the district and “ordered” stoppage of work for the company’s failure to pay the levy demanded by the group. Terrified by the threat, workers stopped the work on Monday.

 City SP Awakash Kumar said a case has been registered and work will resume on Tuesday. “Full police protection would be provided to those engaged in gas pipeline laying work,” said the City SP.
 
 Meanwhile, the bandh call given by CPI (Maoist) in the district evoked partial response. While the bandh was near total in Dumaria, Imamganj, Banke Bazar and Raushanganj areas of Sherghati sub-division, life remained normal elsewhere in the district.
 
 The bandh call was given by the Red outfit to register protest against the recent encounter in which four   were killed in the Fatehpur police station area of the district last month. Calling the encounter as fake, the Maoists alleged that the killing was done in cold blood.
 
 In the Maoist-hit areas of the district, including Dumaria and Imamganj, bank branches, including those of Punjab National Bank, the lead bank of the district and Madhya Bihar Gramin Bank remained closed. Roads wore a deserted look as motorised vehicles kept off the roads. Shops, educational institutions and government offices too remained closed.
 
 An alert was sounded on the bandh eve. The City SP said no report of any untoward incident has been received from anywhere. Sources said the bandh impact was also felt in several police station areas of the neighbouring Aurangabad district.
