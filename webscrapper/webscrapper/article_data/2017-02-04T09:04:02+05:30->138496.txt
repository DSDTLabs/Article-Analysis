 The politically crucial state is on the priority list of the BJP government as even in 2016-17, UP bagged a significant number of projects, worth around Rs 4,950 crore.
 
 The average allocation for the state, which gave 72 MPs to NDA out of total 80 parliamentary seats during the 2014   polls, went up to Rs 3,405 crore between 2014-15 to 2016-17. The average plan allocation during UPA-II regime (2009-10 to 2013-14) was Rs 1,109.3 crore.
 
 “It is a 541% increase in average plan allocation for the state between UPA-II and the current BJP regime,” said a senior railway official, adding that the allocation is also the highest in the last 10 years.
 
 He said, “The hike in plan outlay is 207% when compared between 2009-13 and 2014-16.”
 
  The high fund allocation for the third consecutive year for several railway infrastructure projects reflects the Modi government's eagerness to regain power in the state which is going to polls this month. However, another official said, “The expansion work in UP also suits the railways' plan to decongest the high density Delhi-Howrah route which will benefit Bihar and West Bengal.”
