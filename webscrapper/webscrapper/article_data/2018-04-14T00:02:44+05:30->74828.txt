Pune: Medhpranav Powar, a Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) graduate, is elated that his “Happy Birthday” won the National Award for the best film on family values.

 Powar’s work was part of the television course. The film is about a father and a son where the older man, a mechanic, has a parallel life as a mascot in birthday parties and weddings.“Such professions carry stigma which is wrong,” Powar said. He went to 12 schools for his cast.
 
 Two other FTII graduates, Swapnil Kapure and Arun Kuppuswamy, won special mention, and a special jury award, respectively. Kapure’s film, “Bhar Dupari”, is about a couple losing their child to tragedy. 
 
 “I was inspired by a Marathi short story about an incident in the afternoon, which became the title. The story has a variety of emotions hence the two leads are professional actors,” Kapure said.
 
 “Monday” by Kuppuswamy borders on the surreal, the banal in the routine, and is a commentary on technological advances.“ My friends and I have wanted to talk about various aspects in society and that’s how our film came about,” he said.
