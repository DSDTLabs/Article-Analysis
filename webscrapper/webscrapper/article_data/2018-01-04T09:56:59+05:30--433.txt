HYDERABAD: Three Indian   who demanded that their salaries be released by a   that employed them in Kuwait have alleged they were also beaten up. “I was taken into a room, beaten and threatened,”  , of Bihar told TOI on phone from Kuwait on Wednesday.

 Two others were also assaulted. The workers reportedly had created a scene in frustration, following which some of the staff members of the company assaulted them. “We will stay put here at the office of the company. Nobody seems to be bothered about us. Until we get our salaries, we cannot go home to India,” Ullah said.
 
 After TOI reported about the plight of over 2,000   in Kuwait who were denied salaries by Kharifi National, many took to social media seeking help. About 45 workers continued their ‘sit-in’ at the company office for the 11th day.
 
 A social worker, Shaheen Sayyed, who has been helping the workers with food and taking up their issue with the embassy, said the Indian government should come to their rescue. Sayyed said the Indian Embassy in Kuwait should make use of the Indian Workers' Welfare Fund at least to pay the penalties of those who have been forced to overstay even after expiring of their visa, waiting for settlement of their dues.
 
 Naresh Naidu, a worker, said many were even unable to move out of the camps where they were lodged out of fear of being caught by police for overstaying. Once, company representatives asked those whose visas had expired to visit the company head office the next day. “When they wen, they were taken to the police station,” Naidu, a resident of Narsapuram in West Godavari district, said.
 
 Congress MP Anand Bhaskar Rapolu said the Telangana government should help as many workers were from the state. He urged external affairs minister   and CM K Chandrasekhar Rao to intervene so that the workers get their dues.
