LUCKNOW: A viral video showing tea vendors filling cans with water from the train's toilet has created a scare among passengers at Charbagh railway station. 

 On Saturday, many passengers said they would not drink tea in trains and on platforms any more. Others demanded railway authorities to be vigilant and take strict action against such vendors. 
 
 Railway officials said that after an investigation, it had been found that the incident occurred in train 12759 Chennai   at Secunderabad railway station in December 2017. 
 
 On the basis of the inquiry, a fine of Rs 1 lakh was slapped on the vending contractor. However, passengers were not aware of the fact. Many thought the video was from Charbagh station. The 1.24-minute video shows a tea vendor waiting outside a western toilet, while another vendor is in the toilet, filling water in cans. 
 
 Aakash Jethwani, a passenger of New Delhi AC Express, said, "I saw that scary video. Officials are not aware of the activities of train pantry staff or vendors. There is no hygiene in food or beverages. I have decided I will not buy any edible or drinking item from railways."
 
 Passenger of Lucknow Mail PV Rana said, "There is no vigilance on unauthorized vendors. Some days ago, I read about unhygienic water distribution at Meerut station. I am a regular commuter between Lucknow and Delhi but I avoid drinking tea in trains due to lack of hygiene."
 
 "It sounds sweet to the ears when one hears "chai, garam chai" inside coach on a morning. But I was shocked when I saw the video in which vendors were filling kettles from a toilet. I will try to not even look at kettles any more as they remind me of filthy toilets," said  , who had to board Intercity Express.
 
 Northern Railway divisional railway manager   said a drive had been launched to check the menace. On Saturday, 12 unauthorised vendors were caught selling edible items in trains.
