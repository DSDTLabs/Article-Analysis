AMARAVATI: Nandamuri Balakrishna-starrer and Tollywood's blockbuster   has obtained 100 per cent entertainment   from AP government. The state cabinet has cleared the proposal giving tax benefits to the film on Wednesday. 

 Interestingly, chief minister   recused himself from the cabinet meeting while the subject was tabled for discussion. He decided to stay away for a while to avoid criticism that the film got the tax benefits just because it was starred by his brother-in-law and Hindupur legislator Nandamuri Balakrishna. Gauthamiputra Satakarni is Balakrishna's 100th film and fits the bill to get the tax exemption under historical biopic category. Interestingly, the state government issued a GO (Ms14.dt.09.01.2017) granting tax benefit to   much before the cabinet granted its nod. The GO claimed that it had decided to provide 100 per cent   tax exemption for the film under AP Entertainment Tax Act 1939. 
 
 The subject was hurriedly routed to the cabinet after a social activist challenged the manner in which tax exemption was granted to the film in the High Court which issued notices to the state government asking it to submit all the records pertaining to the grant of tax sop to the film. "We have decided to provide 100 per cent tax relief to Gautamiputra Satakarni at the cabinet meeting," said information and public relations minister Palle Raghunatha Reddy. He said that CM had left the cabinet meeting hall for a brief period to allow the ministers to take an impartial call on the issue. When asked whether anyone opposed the move, Reddy shot back: "Who dares to go against Nandamuri family?"
