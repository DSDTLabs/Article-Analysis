Nagpur: ‘Zindagi Milke Bitayenge’, a programme of old and new songs, kept the audience spellbound with singers presenting soulful songs at Scientific Society Hall on Saturday.

 The retro musical extravaganza, organized by ‘Raaga to Rock’ and supported by Alexis Hospital, was conceptualized by Sanjeev Jagtap.
 
 Hit compositions of the 90s like, ‘Kaha tak yeh mann ko’, ‘Aisa sama na hota’, Deewana leke aaya hai’, ‘Wadiya mera daman raaste’ and ‘Rukh jaa o dil deewane’ had the spectators to hum with the singers. 
 
 Upcoming artiste Parvathi Nair mesmerized the crowd with ‘Mohe rang do lal’ and back to back duet performance with Anil Pillay like ‘Aye mere humsafar’ and ‘Wada raha sanam’ which earned huge applause. Child artiste Mrunmayee Jagtap made her first stage performance on ‘Tu hi yeh mujhko bata de’ from the sequel of Aashiqui.
 
 Sanjeev presented peppy rock number ‘Yaar bina chain kaha re’. He gave in to the audience’s demand for ‘O mere dil ke chain’. ‘Mere khwabo mein jo aaye’ from hit movie DDLJ was loved by all. ‘Haal kaisa hai janab’ from black and white era of Indian cinema and another back to back combo of dance number ‘Dum maro dum’ and romantic song ‘I love you’ sung by Sangeeta and Parvathi had the people sway to tunes.
 
 The guests at the programme were assistant manager of Alexis Hospital Dheeraj Tiwari, MNS general secretary Hemant Gadkari, corporator Praful Gudadhe, social activist and entrepreneur Rajiv Jagtap, senior counsel Indira Bodade, noted singer Surbhi Dhomne, ACP (traffic) Ashok Bagul and Sagar Madhumatke. 
 
 The audience was left mesmerized by nostalgic tunes and witty comments by anchor Shweta Shelgaonkar. The music was arranged by Prashant Nagmote and Raja Rathod. 
 
 The event concluded with a group rendition of ‘Zindagi milke bitayenge’.
