Chennai: Fund raising through initial public offerings (IPOs) nearly doubled in 2016-17. IPOs mobilised Rs 29,018 crore in 2016-17, the best showing in six years. The 25 main-board IPOs alone collectively raised Rs 28,211 crore during the year.

 The response from the public to the main-board IPOs was very good. While 15 IPOs received mega response of more than 10 times — Advanced Enzyme at 81.54 times, followed by Quess Corp (80.92), Avenue Supermarts (73.32), Thyrocare Technologies (51.98) and RBL Bank (48.71). The highest-ever mobilisation through IPOs (Rs 41,323 crore) was recorded in 2007-08. Retail investors also subscribed to IPOs in a big way in 2016-17. The highest number of applications was received by Avenue Supermarts (17.40 lakh) followed by Bombay Stock Exchange (11.32 lakh), Larsen & Toubro Infotech (10.25 lakh), ICICI Prudential Life Insurance (10.24 lakh) and RBL Bank (10.16 lakh), according to PRIME Database, which compiles data on the primary capital market.
 
 “The response to IPOs was further buoyed by strong listing performance,” said Pranav Haldea, managing director, PRIME Database. Of the 23 IPOs which got listed, 18 gave a return of over 10% according to the closing price on listing date. Avenue Supermarts gave a stupendous return of 114% followed by Quess Corp. (59%) and Sheela Foam (41%).
 
 The largest IPO was from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, which mobilised Rs 6,057 crore. The average issue size was a high Rs 1,128 crore. A notable feature of the year again was that several companies that hit the market had a prior PE/VC (private equity/venture capital) investment.
 
 This was true for 11 out of the 25 IPOs. Offers for sale (OFS) by such PE/VC investors at Rs 4,244 crore accounted for 15% of the total IPO amount. OFS by promoters, at Rs 10,953 crore, accounted for a further 39% of the IPO amount. The year, again, witnessed significant activity in the SME (small and medium enterprises) platform. There were as many as 78 SME IPOs which raised a total of about Rs 800 crore compared to around Rs 310 crore collected in 2015-16 from 50 IPOs.
 
 According to Haldea, 2017-18 looks very promising for IPOs. “Already at the beginning of the year, there are 13 companies holding Sebi approval wanting to raise over Rs 9,230 crore. Another 10 are wanting to raise about Rs 16,736 crore are awaiting approval,” he stated.
 
 Despite the stellar show by IPOs, there was only a marginal increase in funds raised from equity markets overall. Funds mobilised from equity markets improved 5% to Rs 51,288 crore, according to PRIME Database.
 
 This was due to the huge fall in money raised by stake dilution under the OFS (offer for sale) route in stock exchanges. OFS, through which promoters dilute their holdings, fell from Rs 19,822 crore in 2015-16 to just Rs 8,390 crore in 2016-17.
