HYDERABAD: Scientists have warned that mobile phones spread infections in hospitals. Their advice: Do not carry your phone inside a medical ward or ICU lest the handset infects patients. It is known that mobile phones are a breeding ground for harmful bacteria and viruses.

 But what is worrying is that most of the germs found on mobile phones have developed resistance to several known  .   have also cautioned doctors and nurses not to carry phones during hospital rounds.
 
 A research paper on   and harmful germs developing resistance to antibiotic drugs was presented at the   here by M Kumari Chitturi of the microbiology department of SV University, Tirupati. At least three research papers have been published on mobile phone bacteria. 
 
 While bacteria has already been found on medical devices, including BP apparatus, mobile phones are the non-medical equipment responsible for the spurt in hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections.
 
 A study involving about 100 samples from the keypads of mobile phones used by doctors and nurses in a hospital found as many as 56 samples had bacterial colonies. The worrying factor was the presence of E coli bacteria on the touchscreens of mobile handsets, the researchers said.
 
 Researchers said that poor hand hygiene was mainly responsible for the growth of harmful germs on mobiles.
 
 Besides washing of hands, handsets should be disinfected at regular intervals, they said. They suggested that all hospitals should strictly follow a “no-mobile-phone policy”. It has been found that the handsets get infested with bacteria also due to saliva contamination from the mouth.
