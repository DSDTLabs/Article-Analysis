LUCKNOW:   on Sunday warned BJP MLAs from making any   either in   

 Yogi addressed the BJP legislative party meeting a day before the special session of the UP assembly. An MLA privy to the meeting quoted Yogi saying that any controversy around BJP MLAs or ministers has a direct bearing on the government, hence every effort should be made to avoid it. 
 
 Yogi’s warning comes days after four-time   from Gorakhpur, Radha Mohan Das Agrawal, had a public spat with an IPS officer. Agrawal’s remarks were widely criticised.
 
 The special session of the UP assembly would begin on Monday with Governor’s address to a joint sitting followed by tabling of the GST Bill.

 The government wants the House should function smoothly, an MLA said, adding that it’s a rare occasion in the House that 59% of its total members are first-time MLAs.
