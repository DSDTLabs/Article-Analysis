MUMBAI: In a bid to ensure that fishing fishing off Worli’s Lotus jetty continues unhindered, the BMC’s ambitious   project is expected to have a a 250-odd metre-long   on the stretch— third such in city after the Bandra Worli Sea Link and Metro rail viaduct on Versova-Ghatkopar corridor.

 The southern stretch of the Coastal Road project, which has been taken up by  , will span nearly 10 km, from Marine Drive to the Worli end of the Bandra Worli Sea Link (BWSL). According to officials, after interactions with the local fishing community it was decided that the prime focus would be to not hamper fishing activities. “Therefore the part which is passing near Lotus Jetty close to the Samudra Mahal in Worli, we plan to have cable stayed bridge which would ensure that the existing fisherman’s livelihood is not affected. The incoming and outgoing boats as well as the aquatic life would not be affected because there would be no columns raised to support the bridge as well,” said an official. 
 
 The jetty is known to cater to 30 fishing boats, which go up to 3-4 km in the sea. Damodar Tandel, president of Akhil Maharashtra Machhimar Kriti Samiti, said, “We are not against any development for the city as long as our fishing community is not affected. This is our only means of livelihood the same should not be affected.” 
 
 A cable-stayed bridge has one or more towers (or pylons), from which cables support the bridge deck. The cables run directly from the tower to the deck, normally forming a fan-like pattern or a series of parallel lines.
 
 The BMC is expecting coastal road work to begin in April end. However officials said the actual work on ground would begin only post monsoon as prior to that contractors would utilize the time for mobilizing man and machinery. An official said the project is expected to be completed by 2022. If there’s any delay, both the contractor as well the project management consultant would be penalised.
