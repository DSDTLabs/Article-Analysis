HYDERABAD:   (MIM) drew a blank in all 35 seats it contested in Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, despite   drawing massive crowds in his election trail. 

 Talking to reporters at party headquarters in Darussalam on Saturday, the MIM president said poll results proved the Muslim vote-bank is a myth and the community is no torch-bearer of halting the saffron juggernaut. He also compared the BJP to a computer, with 'development' as its user name and 'Hindutva' as password.
 
 "I have always been stating there was never and will never be a Muslim vote-bank. It has always been the opposite," said Owaisi, who represents Hyderabad in the Lok Sabha.
 
 While constituencies with a substantial Muslim population such as Deoband too went to BJP, Owaisi claimed he is certain most Muslims did not vote for the saffron party. "At least 80-90 per cent Muslims did not vote for them," he said, while wondering which party was communal and which was secular. BJP's 'programme' and rhetoric in Uttar Pradesh was not inclusive, he said.
 
 Responding to questions from the media, Owaisi admitted that crowds at his public meetings did not translate into votes. "I hope in the future, it will convert into votes for us. It is not the responsibility of Muslims to 'stop' BJP. This burden is off our shoulders," he said.
 
 Commenting on   alliance, he said, "Victory has many fathers, but defeat has none.   went against his own father," adding that its rule was riddled with corruption.
 
 Touching upon allegations of EVM tampering levelled by   supremo  , Owaisi said he hoped Election Commission of India would respond.
 
 While the MIM leader's public speeches attracted crowds, he was careful about predicting gains during interactions with media in UP. Unlike his speeches in UP, Owaisi did not comment on Prime Minister   on Saturday.
