Shillong:   legislator Julius Dorphang, accused of raping a minor, was arrested from Guwahati and brought here on Saturday.

 Dorphang was arrested from an inter-state bus terminus in Guwahati’s Garchuk area by the East Khasi Hills Police, assissted by Assam Police. A joint police team from the two states had raided a house in Hatigaon, where he was reported to be staying. The court of the additional district commissioner on Saturday remanded Dorphang to five days’ police custody.
 
 A session’s court had on Wednesday issued a non-bailable warrant for Dorphang’s   on the charges of raping a 14-year-old girl twice. He had been absconding for 11 days, giving Meghalaya Police the slip after he was booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. 
 
 Another FIR has been filed against him by the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) in Ri-Bhoi on the basis of the victim’s statement that she was also sexually assaulted at a guest house in the district. The guest house is owned by Meghalaya home minister and Congress leader HDR Lyngdoh’s son. Police have also moved court appealing for Section 5(c) of the POCSO Act to be added as well, since it was a sexual assault committed by a public servant. 
 
 Dorphang, the former ‘chairman’ of the banned Khasi militant outfit Hynniewtrep National Liberation Council, had surrendered, contested elections as an Independent and won.
