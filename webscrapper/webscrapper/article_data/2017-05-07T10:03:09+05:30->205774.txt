 After swimming for a while, Khandwe started drowning. Before his friends could raise an alarm, Khandwe drowned, police said. According to the local residents, Khandwe was exhausted and couldn’t reach the shore on time.

 Local residents said Khandwe was the only child of his parents and was pursuing graduation from a college in Pune.
