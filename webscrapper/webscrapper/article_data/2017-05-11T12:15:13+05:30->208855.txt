HYDERABAD: With barely a fortnight before  , the important all-departments coordination meeting has still not been convened. The all-departments meeting sees participation from major stakeholders including police, Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and  , fire department, State Wakf Board and Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation.The meeting is convened to identify issues, plan and implement much in advance the needs that may arise during the holy month. For instance, for several years, electricity department has been providing mobile transformers to cater to the additional power needs.

 While the meeting is usually convened about a month before Ramzan, the fact that it has not started this year has raised concerns. Sources said while the meeting was scheduled for April 29, it was postponed. Later, it was supposed to be held on May 8. but this too was postponed.
 
 Sources who did not wish to be identified said that the meeting on April 29 was postponed on account of the assembly session which was convened to take up the Land Acquisition Bill. “We are not sure why the rescheduled meeting was postponed. Perhaps it was because the deputy chief minister, who usually presides over the meeting, was keeping unwell,“ a source said.
 
 Major issues to be tackled ahead of Ramzan are traffic management, power and sanitation. “During Ramzan, traffic is stopped at Nayapul and diverted elsewhere. Will this continue,“ asked Md  , resident of Noor Khan Bazar.
 
 Others raised concerns about how the GHMC, law and order officials and others would deal with hawkers.
