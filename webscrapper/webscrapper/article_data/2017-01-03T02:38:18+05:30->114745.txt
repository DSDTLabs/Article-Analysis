NEW DELHI: The income tax department has served notices on Delhi health minister   for a proposed reassessment of income for two financial years.

 Unlike a few months ago when Jain had been summoned for he had described as a “witness” for notices related to two companies with which the   leader had alleged links, the two notices to the minister are related to his personal income tax returns.
 
 Sources said the notices are related to assessment years 2011-12 and 2012-13 (financial years 2010-11 and 2011-12) with the tax department also proposing to recompute the loss or depreciation allowance for the two financial years along with reassessment of the income claimed by Jain, which was declared as a little over Rs 9 lakh. Sources said that the notices were issued last week under section 148 of the Income Tax Act and Jain has been given a month to respond.
 
 Over the last three days, TOI repeatedly sought to contact Jain for comments but did not get a response.
 
 During the two financial years, Jain was a director in three companies — Indo MetalImpex, Akinchan Developers and   —which are under probe for possible understatement of income and alleged links with hawala entry operators. 
 
 Jain had then said that he had invested in the companies but did not have a connection with now. He had said that the tax department was not investigating the companies but was only reassessing the income and he had only been called as a witness.
 
 The tax department is alleging that money was illegally routed to these companies from Kolkata-based “entry operators” and is investigating the case, said sources.
 
 Recently, CBI had registered a case against the alleged illegal appointment of Nikunj Aggarwal as an Officer on Special Duty to Jain.
