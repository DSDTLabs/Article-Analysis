Madurai: The number of fatal road accidents in Madurai, in comparison to last year, has come down by 20% this year so far, said Madurai city police commissioner Mahesh Kumar Aggarwal. He said this during a free eye checkup camp organised by the city traffic police, as part of 29th Road Traffic Week, which kick started on Monday.

 A large number of auto rickshaw drivers and TNSTC bus drivers took part in the free eye checkup camp. The commissioner said that there has been a considerable decline in the fatal accidents. There was a 7% decline in number of fatal accidents in 2017, as compared to 2016.
 
 Aggarwal appreciated the auto rickshaw drivers for being ears and eyes of the police. “There is a general perception that auto rickshaw drivers are rude and violate traffic rules. But many of the drivers are helpful to the people and police. They are the first to help the road accident victims and pass information to the police,” he said.
 
 He added that since Madurai is a tourist attraction, auto rickshaw drivers can play vital role in creating good impression of the city by being honest and helpful to the tourists.
 
 He instructed them not to get into the bus bays in order to lure the passengers and create traffic congestion.
 
 “Drivers can help the traffic policemen in the junction nearby their auto stand, when they are free. They can help pedestrians cross the road safely. If auto drivers and police personnel join hands we can make a big difference,” he said.
 
 Earlier in the day, a rally was organised by road transport department. Madurai district collector K Veera Raghava Rao flagged off the event at Tamukkam ground. The participants took oath to follow the road rules and avoid road accidents.
 
 Deputy commissioner of traffic, Arun Balagopalan, RTO central, K Kalyanakumar, assistant commissioners, Joseph Nixon and T Ravichandran also took part in the inaugural event of the free eye checkup camp.
