BANGALORE:   has never been partial to words. He has addressed media after epic matches with little more than `yes' or `no' for answers. But in his new role as India's   nonplaying captain Bhupathi said his piece. Excerpts:

 Were you surprised by the offer of captaincy?
 
 It wasn't something I thought about. Anil (Khanna) asked me about it when we met at the IPTL in Hyderabad last year. Obviously it's a privilege to be the captain. It comes with huge challenges. For years we've had injury issues, the game has changed hugely , it's more physical than ever.Luckily for me   (  secretary) has been receptive. We have two specialist physios here with the team for the first time. We absolutely need it because rehab and getting players ready to play in conditions like this, fitness and recovery is an ongoing process.
 
 Given yours and  ' history, you're going to get flak whether or not he's in the team...
 
 I don't care what the media or anyone else has to say about this as long as Leander understands what I'm doing. And he does. The aim is for India to win the tie and that's what both Leander and I want.
 
 Would you say that this is the most solid bunch of players Indian tennis has had in a long time?
 
 I would go so far as to say that this is the most depth we've had in 35 years. For sure. It was mostly two players holding fort, Vijay (Amritraj) and Ramesh (Krishnan), then Ramesh and Leander, then Leander and Mahesh, then Rohan (Bopanna) and Prakash (Amritraj), then Somdev (Devvarman).
 
 What we lack here in India is expertise in fitness. Everybody does basic exercises and plays tennis. But that's not enough, you have to do specific fitness drills for tennis. We have a couple of juniors here, training with the team. They say they work hard on their fitness, but haven't been exposed to this kind of training.
