GURUGRAM: Distressed by recurring   crisis in their area, residents of sector 21, 22 and 23 will hold a protest if their problems are ot resolved within next couple of days.

 A bunch of residents met MCG commissioner V Umashankar on Monday and submitted a written complaint alleging water shortage in these areas. “We have been calling MCG officials daily and have written several complaints but the problem persists. If we do not see any improvement in the water supply, what choice do we have as citizens, but to protest,” said Bheem Singh Yadav, RWA president, sector 22 B.
 
 He said the MCG commissioner told them that he would have the problem sorted in a fortnight but that wasn’t good enough. “The commissioner finally assured us that the water crisis will be solved within the next three to four days,” said Singh. According to residents, there has been no water for the last  . Before that for a week, the residents were getting contaminated water mixed with sewage.
 
 “Water has always been an issue in this area. At times we do not get water and other times water is mixed with sewage,” said Vinod Kumar Jain, an affected resident.
 
 The week before that on March 9 TOI had reported that the residents in the area faced an acute water shortage as the machinery at the boosting station in sector 23 was damaged. 
 
 Around 250 plots have been complaining of water shortage for the past 20 years. All these plots are located higher from the ground level so even on the days when residents do get water, the water pressure isn’t sufficient.
 
 MCG commissioner when approached said this is the first summer after MCG took over the   from Huda. “Our long term plan is to have a new boosting station but that will take a year. Meanwhile we will make some local arrangements,” said Umashankar.
