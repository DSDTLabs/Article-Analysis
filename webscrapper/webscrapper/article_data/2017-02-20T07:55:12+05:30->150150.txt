PUNE: A four-year-old boy from Karvenagar succumbed to   fever-induced complications at a city hospital on February 14, taking the death count due to the infection to two in the city this year, so far.

 The child had developed flu-like symptoms on February 8, including fever and vomiting. Also, he had altered sensorium, drowsiness and suffered two episodes of seizure. His parents initially consulted a neighbourhood doctor. When his condition did not improve, he was admitted to   hospital (DMH) on February 12.
 
 “His blood samples tested positive for dengue antibody IgM, a confirmatory test for the disease, on February 13. He succumbed to dengue haemorraghic shock around 3.19pm on February 14,” a doctor from DMH said.
 
 As per the records of  , Pune has registered a total of 39 dengue cases this year, so far. Among these, private hospitals have reported 30 cases while government-designated laboratories and sentinel centres have reported nine.
 
 The city has been battling mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and chikungunya since July last year with more cases being reported from Warje, Hadapsar and core areas like Kothrud, Tilak Road, Karvenagar and Aundh.
 
 “The aedes aegypti mosquito, responsible for the disease, has adapted to breeding in and around human dwellings. It deposits its eggs in any uncovered water container,” entomologist Mukund Deshpande said.
 
 He added that keeping the refrigerator drawers dry, punching holes in the bottom of paper bags before placing them in the garbage, properly covering trash containers, drums, barrels, tanks, buckets or any other container where water can accumulate are some of the best preventive measures.
 
 Since aedes aegypti breeds in fresh water, health officials said it is imperative for every household to empty and clean all utensils and tanks once a week.
