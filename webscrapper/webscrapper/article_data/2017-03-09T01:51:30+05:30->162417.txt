MUMBAI: While Mumbai University’s move to make the re-evaluation application process online was meant to relieve students of additional stress, its sudden implementation has failed to achieve the purpose. Not many colleges were aware of the new process and therefore ended up collecting the application forms of students physically along with the fees.

 With the deadline nearing for submission of applications, colleges have to now return the forms and the money to the students and ask them to apply online individually. “The university did not notify colleges about the move officially, though a circular was put up on their website. Officials at the university’s examination house refused to accept the forms from our office staff, which went to physically submit the applications,” said a principal. Another principal said that he has asked his office staff to remove all the circulars related to it only when a few students brought it to the college’s notice.
 
 The university, however, had released the circular recently, announcing the decision to accept re-evaluation and photocopy applications online on its website (http://mum.digitaluniversity.ac).
