NAVI MUMBAI: The state public works department (PWD) will carry out repairs on the expansion joint plates of the   bridge on Friday from 10.30am to 4pm. Mumbai-bound vehicular movement is likely to be disrupted and traffic snarls are expected on the   highway as the work will be carried out on the southern carriageway. All heavy motor vehicles (HMVs) heading towards Mumbai will be diverted to   bridge.

 PWD deputy engineer P   said, “We have chosen Friday for the repairs as it is a public holiday and hence, vehi cular movement on the bridge will be less. One lane of the Mumbai-bound carriageway will have to be closed. Vehicles will be allowed to ply on the other two lanes. To avoid traffic snarls on the Sion-Panvel highway, we have requested the traffic department to divert HMVs coming from Pune and Panvel along the Airoli creek bridge to reach Mumbai.“
 
 DCP (traffic) Nitin Pawar said, “We will take adequate measures to ensure there is no traffic congestion on the Vashi Creek bridge. Vehicles will be diverted considering the need of the hour. Sufficient traffic cops will be deployed on the bridge and at several prime junctions from Vashi toll plaza till Vashi flyover junction and   signal to regulate the traffic flow.“
