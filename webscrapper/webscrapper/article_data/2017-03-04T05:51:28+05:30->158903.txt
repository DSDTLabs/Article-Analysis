PATIALA: Employees of   (PSPCL) were allegedly assaulted at   in Patran,  , on Friday when they had gone there to disconnect electricity supply of some houses there.

 On a complaint lodged by senior officials of the state-owned power distribution company, a case has been registered a Patran police station under sections 186 and 353 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 
 
 The feud that started as a heated exchange of words between the residents and the power officials turned violent when family members of some of the villagers attacked them. Following the incident senior officials of the PSPCL (Urban), Patran, reported the matter to the police and got a case registered against the accused, a press release issued by the police said.
 
 No police official could be contacted for comment.
 
 When contacted, PSPCL chairperson and managing director K D Chaudhary said it would be wrong to say that PSPCL had suddenly started disconnecting power connection to recover dues. “The power corporation undertakes similar exercise every year to recover pending bills. A total of Rs 750 crore was pending against bills from private consumers and Rs 350 were in default with the state government departments,” he said.
 
 He also underplayed the incident of villagers attacking PSPCL officials.
