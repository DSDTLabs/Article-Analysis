Colva: During a clean-up drive in Benaulim, students and NGO workers were in for a rude shock when they found stretches of the beach being used for defecation. The students collected 15 bags of refuse from the area. Ritu Nadkarni, a member of the Ritumbara Environment Society, said, “Only those stretches of the beach were clean which were used by locals and tourists. The remaining area was full of garbage and used to defecate. In fact, every 10m, we found human faeces.” 

 About 60 students from Kare Law College recently collected 35 bags of garbage from the beach and the stretch of road leading to the beach to commemorate International Coastal Clean-up Day. Organizers urged locals to segregate waste at source. Nadkarni said the campaign was also about urging youth to not dump garbage, especially plastic, in water.
