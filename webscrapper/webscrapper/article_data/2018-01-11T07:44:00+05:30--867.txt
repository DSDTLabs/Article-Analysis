Chandigarh: Taking cognizance of a petition filed by Ryan Augustine Pinto of Ryan International Group seeking permission to go abroad, Punjab and Haryana high court on Wednesday issued a notice to the CBI, seeking its response.

 Ryan, who is CEO of the group, had to approach the HC for permission, as the court had granted him bail in relation to Pradyuman murder case on the condition that he would leave country without the permission of the high court. A resident of Borivali (East) Mumbai, Ryan wants to visit USA and Dubai from January 19 to February 9, 2018, to attend a conference on ‘The impact of technology in education’.
 
 The issue will now come up for hearing on January 16, when CBI files its response. On November 21, 2017, the Punjab and Haryana high court granted interim bail to Ryan Augustine Pinto, his father and owner of Ryan Group of Institutions, Augustine Pinto and his mother, group (MD) Grace Pinto. However, the high court asked them to join investigations and not to leave the country without permission from the court.
 
 The victim’s father, Barun Chandra Thakur, however, approached the Supreme Court against the relief granted to the Pinto family and sought action against them saying they were part of the conspiracy that led to his son’s death. The apex court dismissed his plea and upheld the HC orders. On September 8, 2017, the body of 7-year-old Pradyuman was found inside the toilet of the school with the throat slit. Initially, the matter was investigated by the Haryana police, which booked the bus conductor of the school for the murder of the Class II student. Later, the case was referred to the CBI. The premier agency arrested a Class XI student of the same school for the murder.
