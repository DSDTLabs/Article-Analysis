MYSURU: An accused who was on the run for eight years was arrested in Bengaluru on Tuesday. He was picked up from   in Bengaluru following a tip-off.

 Ishaq Pasha, 58, a carpenter, had murdered wife, Suraiya Banu, 35, and his minor sister in-law,  , 17, in May 2009 at his Mysuru residence in Udayagiri police limits. He slit his wife’s throat after an argument with her. Police said that he suspected her fidelity and often accused her of having an affair.
 
 Pasha, a native of Uttar Pradesh, was working in Mysuru and married Suraiya Banu, a local. The couple had no children. On the day of the incident, Pasha slit his wife’s throat and then attacked his sister in-law who was a witness to the crime. Though Suraiya died on the spot, Siddique died three days later in a hospital.
 
 Udayagiri police inspector PP Santhosh said that Pasha fled from Karnataka soon after the murder and went underground. He was in Rajasthan and came to Bengaluru two days ago under the impression that he was no longer under their radar.
 
 On a tip-off that Pasha would be landing in Bengaluru, a police team was waiting for him in Bengaluru. They had no problem identifying him. Pasha was 50 when he committed the murders. He has admitted to the murders, said police.
