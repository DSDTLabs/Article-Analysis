KOLKATA: A retired engineer died in a freak   at a Kasba residential complex after he fell down the lift shaft on Friday afternoon. Though a complaint is yet to be registered, police are looking into the matter.

 Rabindranath Chakraborty, 76, a retired   (BRO) engineer met with the accident as he was getting ready to go out for a walk. He left his third-floor flat and pressed the lift button. As he pulled the lift’s gate, it opened and Chakraborty stepped in presuming that the lift was there. But the lift hadn’t actually come up and was at the first floor. Chakraborty fell down the shaft and was severely injured. He was rushed to a local nursing home, where he died after some time.
 
 “We are talking to the representative of the organization that looks after the maintenance of the lift. So far no snag has been found,” said a police officer. The family members refused to talk to the media.
 
 Chakraborty had been suffering from general geriatric ailments, but had no other major health problems, the police officer said. 
 
 Primary investigation has revealed that the lift’s door was designed to open even if the lift was on another floor. 
 
 “This is not usual. Normally, if the lift is on any other floor, the door doesn’t open. We are looking into that,” said the officer.
