Given that things haven't been moving fast enough on the   front, it is likely that   is getting ready to complete the long-delayed Vishwaroopam 2 in the meantime. The release of the film, which was originally planned for early 2015, has been delayed because of the financial troubles that befell its producer  . The producer, the actor had claimed in an interview to us, had “disappeared from the scene, in the sense that he has committed himself to various other big projects and probably overstretched himself “ and is also not willing to let go of the film.

 But now, Kamal seems to have taken matters in his hands, going by his announcement on social media. “4 all looking forward to VR2.Am personally getting in 2 clear the path. Bigger obstacles are out of the way . Whats left is technical & legal,“ the actor tweeted, but added a note of caution, mentioning that the post-production work on the film will take six months to complete.
