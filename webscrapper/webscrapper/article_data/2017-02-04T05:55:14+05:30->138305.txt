GURUGRAM: The next time you see a car or a two-wheeler jumping the traffic light or parked near a school or hospital  , don’t turn a blind eye. Click a photo of the vehicle, along with its number plate, or make a video of the violation, and share the same with the police. And be rest assured that the violator will be fined.

 To tighten the noose around traffic violators, the   on Friday set up a new   at Old Police Commissionerate on Railway Road. Two new e-challan branches have also been opened — one in Old Police Commissionerate and the other in Manesar — apart from the already exisiting branch in Traffic Tower in Sushant Lok.
 
 Under the postal challan system, people can take photographs or make videos of violations/violators and email or WhatsApp them to the police, who in turn will retrieve details and mailing addresses of the violators and post challans to them. Within a week of receiving the challan, the owners of the vehicles will have to pay the penalty for the traffic violation, else they will be served with a summon from court, cops said, adding violators can pay the fines in the nearest  .
 
 “This is foolproof way to track those who take the traffic rules for granted. We cannot deploy cops everywhere due to staff shortage, but with this initiative, residents can become citizen-cops. Moreover, when there is proof in the form of photos or videos, the violators will not be able to deny the violation,” Sandeep Khirwar, police commissioner, Gurgaon, told TOI.
 
 The email id for the postal challan branch is pcbranchggm@gmail.com, while the WhatsApp number is 9999981800.
