PANAJI: Stating that Goa had made significant progress in implementing schemes of the central government, minister of state for urban development and housing affairs, Hardeep Singh Puri, on Saturday said Goa chief minister   had assured him the state would be open defecation-free by October 2.

 Reviewing implementation of flagship programmes announced by PM  , Puri said other states had a lot to learn from Goa.
 
 “Goa is one state that has made impressive strides in solid waste management,” Puri said, while speaking to reporters during a press conference at the Adil Shah Palace. He launched a star rating protocol for garbage-free cities, where rating would be conducted on the basis of several parameters identified by the ministry under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM).
 
 “The 7-star rating system will be based on indicators such as door-to-door collection, bulk generator compliance, source segregation, sweeping, scientific processing of waste, scientific land-filling, plastic waste management, construction and demolition management, dump remediation and citizen grievance redressal system,” Puri said.
 
 He praised the implementation of the affordable housing scheme in the state, and said around 5,000 families would benefit. “The state also has a good project which converts waste into energy and needs to be replicated throughout India,” he said.
 
 State urban development minister Francis D’Souza, was also present.
