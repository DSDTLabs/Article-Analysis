CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court would decide if the parties directly purchasing   ( ) developed plots from land owners whose land was acquired would be entitled for exemption from paying stamp duty in execution of conveyance deed in their favour. 

 Taking cognizance of several petitions filed by those who had purchased plots in Gmada developed sector in New Chandigarh from land owners, the high court has asked Gmada and Punjab government to file a reply on the issue.
 
 Justice   has issued the notice in the wake of a petition filed by   and others. 
 
 Arav Gupta, the counsel for the petitioners, contended that the petitioners were the transferees from the land owners whose land was acquired by Gmada for the purpose of developing New Chandigarh. It was submitted that the land owners were given fully developed plots according to the share of their acquired land and Letters of Intent (LOI) were also issued to them for the purpose of execution of conveyance deed in their favour. 
 
 In the present case, LOIs were issued to land owners but they did not get the conveyance deed executed in their favour and sold the plots only on the basis of LOI to the present petitioners, who had got executed the conveyance deed in their favour.
 
 However, when the petitioners asked for the refund of the stamp duty, taking advantage of the notification issued by Gmada as per which the land owners were exempted from paying the stamp duty in respect of execution of sale deed/conveyance deed in their favour, they were denied. 
 
 The revenue authorities had said the land has not been purchased by land owners and petitioners have purchased the plots from land owners, therefore, they are liable to pay the stamp duty.
 
 The counsel for the petitioners, however, has been arguing that since the petitioners have stepped into the shoes of the land owners, the benefit accrued to the land owners has to be given to them. 
 
 The matter would now come up for hearing on July 23.
