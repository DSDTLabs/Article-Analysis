CHANDIGARH: Ten light posts were found uprooted and damaged at two public parks in Sector 21D on Sunday morning, nearly 20 days after a similar act of   was reported from Sector 18 on December 26.

 Police are yet to identify people who damaged the public property. While six bollard lamps were destroyed in one park, four were damaged in the second one. The damage is said to be worth nearly Rs 1 lakh.
 
 The damage caused to the lamp posts, which have a cement base for the foundation, suggested that it took the miscreants either a long time or they used some tools to dig them out.
 
 The president of Residents’ Welfare Association of Sector 21,  , said the incident had raised serious questions over night patrolling out by Chandigarh police. “That such an incident has been repeated in a sector neighbouring Sector 18 is worrying. Where are the police? And what were they doing when this happened?” he said.
 
  (east division)   said he had asked the SHO of Sector 19 police station to register an FIR. “We have also been found that these lights had to be repaired, and their foundation of some was loose. So, we have also written to the electricity wing to fix them,”   said.
