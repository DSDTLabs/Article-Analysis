RAJKOT: A man was shot at in a gang war on   near Rajkot on Tuesday night. However,  ,   alias Bathiyo (41), escaped unhurt in the attack. 

 Nayak, a resident of Nageshwar Road in Jamnagar, was shot at by Razak Chawda alias Sopari and Hussein Chawda. Their associates Sadiq Buchad, Amin Notiyar and eight unidentified assailants have also been booked for the crime. 
 
 The assailants had come in three cars. They chased Nayak’s car and stopped him on   Road, some 12km from Rajkot between Ghanteshwer and   villages, and fired indiscriminately at him from their firearms. 
 
 “Whether the firearms used in the attack were automatic guns, pistols or revolvers will be known once the accused get arrested. Fortunately, Nayak managed to dodge all bullets and survived the attack without any injuries,” said Gandhigram police station inspector M D Chandrawadia. 
 
 The attack was the result of old enmity between Nayak and Buchad. Nayak and Buchad’s father Abdul used to drink alcohol together. Tired of his father’s drinking habit Buchad called up Nayak and scolded him. Incensed at this, Nayak went with a firearm and fired at Buchad two months ago. However, the bullet hit Notiyar, who was injured. 
 
 Nayak was booked for the crime and sent to   two months ago. 
 
 On Tuesday, a session’s court in Jamnagar granted Nayak bail. When he was driving out of the jail premises in his car, the rival gang members followed him in their vehicles and attacked him.
