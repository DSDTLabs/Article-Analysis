Vadodara: A student group of M S University’s Faculty of Arts came face to face with university’s vigilance staff on Thursday.

 The student leaders affiliated with Yuva Shakti Group of Faculty of Arts along with others had reached the university head office to make a representation regarding the choice of subjects provided to students by the faculty. 
 
 The group had earlier made similar representations before dean of the faculty. On Thursday, however, it reached the head office to make representation before the university officials. 
 
 But, things turned ugly when the student leaders entered into heated arguments with the university’s vigilance staffers including head of vigilance staff P P Kanani. 
 
 The leaders allegedly misbehaved and hurled abuses at the vigilance staff. Later, things were brought under control.
