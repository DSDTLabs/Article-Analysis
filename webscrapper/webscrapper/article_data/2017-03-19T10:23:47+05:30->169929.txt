HYDERABAD: Energy minister G   said that Telangana is set to become the biggest solar power generating state in the country by the end of this year.

 Currently, Rajasthan, which generates 1,300 MW solar power, tops the list. As of now, Telangana expects to have an installed capacity of 1,456 MW of solar power by April this year and that is expected to touch 2,000 MW by the end of this year. The state has set itself a goal of generating 5,000 MW of electricity from solar power in the next few years, he said.
 
 The minister was replying to a question from MLAs Somarapu Satyanarayana, Alla Venkateshwar Reddy and   in the Legislative Assembly on Saturday on hydel and   in the state. Jagadishwar Reddy said that China built hybrid generating stations combining hydel and solar units but to generate one mega watt in this manner, would require an investment of Rs 20 crore.
 
 On hydel power genera tion, he said that TSGenco is studying the viability at Kaleshwaram lift irrigation project. He said the earlier Congress government studied the feasibility of power generation at Dummugudem project but the plan was shelved over enormous investment required, among other reasons.
 
 He also said that the lower   project with 240 MM (6x40 MW) was commissioned in October 2016 and Pulichintala hydro power project in September 2016 and the remaining three units would be completed in 2017-18 financial year. The minister asserted that the government would complete Yadadri Thermal Power Plan at any cost and advised the Congress not to create hurdles in the completion of these projects.
