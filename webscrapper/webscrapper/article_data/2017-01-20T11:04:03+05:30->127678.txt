Preparations for the engagement ceremony are in full swing in the Bharadwaj house. Roshni pretends to be nice with everyone, though she has a devious plan up her sleeve. 
 
 Roshni also tries every mean possible to keep Piyush and Vaidehi apart. 
  
 In order to harm Vaidehi, Roshni changes the flower arrangement on the staircase in a way that would make her fall and meet with an accident. But unfortunately, it is Maataji who trips off and injures herself. 
 
 
 
 
  
 Looking at this, Piyush decides to call off his engagement with Vaidehi. Later, Roshni is seen blaming Vaidehi for all the mishaps in the house.
