NEW DELHI: Two days after an assistant professor of   ( ),  , alleged that his car was vandalised by university students for honouring Sukma and Kupwara martyrs, faculty members said that the allegations were baseless. 

  JNU teachers claimed that these "random acts of vandalism have occurred" in the past but "no one, until now, has made baseless allegations, blamed student groups or levelled charges against any particular political ideology." In a statement signed by them, 32 teachers said that they find the incident of the shattering of the car's windshield "worrisome", adding that "this is the first time that such quick and hasty conclusions have been drawn. Instead of investigating a matter of vandalism, this is being recast as some kind of political conspiracy and vendetta. This does not reflect the spirit of JNU." The statement also alleged that "it is only since early 2016 that we are seeing this sense of reflective engagement fraying - which ought to be a cause of concern for us all." 
 
  Singh had claimed that the vandalism was "a reward for organising a condolence meet at JNU and mass gathered for the Sukma and Kupwara martyrs." The teachers retorted that these were baseless allegations against JNU.
