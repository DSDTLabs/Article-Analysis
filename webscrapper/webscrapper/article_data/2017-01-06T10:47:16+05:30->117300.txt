MUMBAI: The Maratha community is planning a rally on January 31 and may bring the city to a grinding halt. The demonstration has been planned to press for their demand for quotas, the death sentence for the accused in the Kopardi gangrape and murder case and a review of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 

 According to a Maratha leader, a decision to take out a procession was taken at a meeting of prominent leaders on Thursday in Aurangabad. 
 
 The procession will start from Marine Drive and activists will head to Azad Maidan to focus the attention of the state government on the community’s demands. “We are unhappy over the manner in which the government was dealing with our demands. We had asked for a time-bound action plan for Maratha reservation, but there has been no progress,” he said.
 
 “On January 31, we will hand over a memorandum to the governor. We will try to make it the biggest ever procession in the history of the state
 
 A week after a minor girl was brutalized and murdered, there was a bandh in Ahmednagar. It was followed by a protest rally in Aurangabad. In view of massive success of the rally, huge processions were taken out all over the state. In Nagpur, a delegation of Maratha leaders had called on chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. 
 
 While Maratha reservation is locked in litigation, Fadnavis was non-committal on halting “misuse” of the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Dalit leaders have it clear to the CM that they will not tolerate dilution of the legislation, Muslims have sought reservation in education and jobs.
