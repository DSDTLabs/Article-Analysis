PUNE: The   of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education will institute an internal committee that will probe into the SSC question paper-leak racket unearthed in Mumbai. 

 Police have, so far, found that six question papers were leaked an hour before the scheduled time of each examination. The papers begin at 10.30am.
 
 Shakuntala Kale, chairperson of   State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education on Friday said an investigation will be launched. 
 
 “The Mumbai division will be told to get the details of the leak from the school. We will write to the police to get information on how it was done so that we can prepare a comprehensive report,” Kale said.
 
 The state board has drawn heavy criticism as almost all the question papers for the examination were out in the open before the papers started.
 
 Kale said the sealed bundles of question papers from the strong room were transferred to the examination centres on the morning of the respective exam.
 
 The chief conductor of the examination has to open the seal around 10.10am and group it for distribution to classes within the school where the examination was conducted.
 
 Neither Kale nor the police could explain how Khan had access to the sealed set of question papers. “We will conduct an enquiry into how he was allowed near the question papers. Teachers and students involved in the racket will be punished as per the state board rules, if found guilty. The committee will also study the laxity by the school,” Kale added .
