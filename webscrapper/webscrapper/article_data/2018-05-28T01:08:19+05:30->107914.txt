NOIDA: On World No Tobacco Day on May 31, the district administration plans to declare the   zone, which houses over 50 educational institutions, as tobacco-free.

 Officials claimed they would remove all tobacco and drug sellers from near educational institutions in Knowledge Park I, II and III zones in   within a week. Some, however, pointed out that the task was easier said than done, given the sheer number of such sellers.
 
 The district tobacco control cell has also decided to rope in educational institutions for the implementation of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003, which levies a fine on smoking in public place, for selling tobacco products to minors, or selling such items within a radius of 100 metres from any educational institution. Six flying squads have been formed to remove all tobacco sellers from the area. 
 
 The teams will have city magistrate, the SDM (Sadar) and SDM (Dadri), SHOs and sub-inspectors. Shweta Khurana, a consultant in the district tobacco cell, said the administration planned to install anti-tobacco hoardings in the area. 
 
 A student said buying tobacco was as easy as buying fruits. “Most juice sellers here have tobacco products with them. Ganja is easily available in   and near the Kailash hospital,” he said.
