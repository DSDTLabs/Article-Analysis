JALANDAR/PHAGWARA: Jalandhar district officials stopped the distribution of subsidized wheat meant for poor blue-card holders midway after the model code of conduct came into force on Wednesday.

 Though grain distribution is an on-going process and does not come under election code, Jalandhar deputy commissioner and district electoral officer said they stopped it after coming to know that the wheat was meant for the period from April to September. “As soon as it came in our notice we got stopped the further distribution,” he said. 
 
 Two trucks loaded with gunny bags of wheat were parked near Kirti Nagar, Ladhowali Road, and several beneficiaries had gathered to collect the supplies. The administration swung into action after one truckload had already been distributed among the beneficiaries.
 
 The DC said as the supplies were meant for six months, the food supplies department would have to make a case before   officer to seek permission for distributing them further. Though a truck was also distributing wheat to beneficiaries in Santokhpura, Phagwara SDM   said it did not come to his notice. 
 
 Meanwhile, officials said the entire issue remained a grey area, as the poll code barred new benefits to people. “There should be no problem in continuing with the old process of distribution, but then officials are also wary of getting on the wrong side of the   and want to play safe,” said an official requesting anonymity.
