CHENNAI: Almost fifty days after the eight-storey Chennai Silks building was gutted in a major fire, the   (CMDA) has declined to provide information under the Right to Information Act ( ) on the action taken against seven other structures in   which had violated building norms. 

 Replying to a plea seeking information on the present status of proceedings and action against the structures, the public information officer (PIO) of CMDA refused to provide the details under the pretext that it required the culling out of information from various records and registers, which would consume enormous time and resources. 
 
 The petitioner, B Kannan of T Nagar, had sought details of action against the buildings, largely comprising textile and jewellery shops in the business nerve centre of the city, in the light of an order of the Madras high court in 2016.
 
 Kannan, who is the secretary of the T Nagar Residents Welfare Association, said the CMDA had filed an affidavit in the high court last year stating that action has been taken by issuing notices to the respective buildings and the exercise will be completed within four weeks. The planning authority was directed to file a compliance report in this regard on June 3, 2016. 
 
 "It was about a year since the order was issued. I filed the RTI seeking details about the current status and action initiated against such buildings, but the planning authority refused to give any information,” Kannan said.
 
 Noting that the RTI reply stated that the compilation of information from various records and registers requires enormous time, he said the CMDA could have allowed him to access the documents. “As a petitioner, I could have either taken photocopies or scanned the required documents. But they have refused to share any information regarding the illegal structures (at T. Nagar),” he said.
 
 CMDA member secretary C Vijayaraj Kumar was not available for comment.
