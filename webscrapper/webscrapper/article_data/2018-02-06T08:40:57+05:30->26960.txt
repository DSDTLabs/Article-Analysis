NEW DELHI: Two men stole a consignment of memory cards worth Rs 24 lakh from a store they worked in because they were unhappy with their employer. The two were arrested a few days ago when they were trying to leave the city.

  (25) and   (25) were upset with the owner of the store, which is located in central Delhi’s  , over not getting a salary hike that they had been demanding for quite some time now. A similar crime was committed by another employee some time back, but the owner never reported it. So, Sharma and Mishra thought that he will not file a complaint this time too. “Encouraged by that incident, both of them planned to misappropriate a high-value consignment,” said DCP (west)  .
 
 On December 22 last year, Mishra and Sharma went to a courier office on the direction of their employer to bring the consignment. However, when they came to know of its value, they decided to steal it. On February 2, Mishra and Sharma were arrested on a tip-off that they will come near the BSES office in west Delhi’s Tilak Nagar to dispose of the cards. Police said seven packets with 24,000 memory cards, which the owner had imported from Singapore, were found with the duo.
