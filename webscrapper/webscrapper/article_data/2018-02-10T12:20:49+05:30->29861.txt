KOLHAPUR: While the first semester students of   ( ), Kolhapur are waiting with baited breath for the upcoming semester exam to be held online from February 17, most students are also cribbing about the fact that they have to travel a long distance to appear for the exam. 

 Most of the centres where the exam will be conducted online are 30-40kms away from the city.
 
 It is to be noted the directorate of vocational education and training (DVET) is conducting the online examination for the first year students of various trades across the state for the very first time. 
 
 A student, who did not wish to be named, said the initiative of online examination is progressive. However, the availability of the exam centres is something that the authorities should have paid more attention. "The availability of transportation, the distance from the home institute, these things should have been taken into consideration," said the student.
 
 Swapnil More, a Kolhapur ITI student and a resident of Radhanagari which is some 50kms away from the city, said that he will have to travel more than 100 kms depending on the availability of the centre and that it would have been convenient had the centres been in the city. 
 
 "I appreciate the digital mode of exams. We are preparing via mock tests at the home institute. It is helping us understand the new approach of the exam," he said.
 
 Sanket Bagal, another student from Kolhapur ITI, said that this is the very first time that such an initiative has been introduced and that it is welcome by the students. 
 
 Principal of Kolhapur ITI   said the exam will be conducted between February 17 and February 21 for which mock tests are being conducted to prepare the students.
 
 Talking of the distance of the exam centres,   said, "We have not received any complaint from the students as of now. We are yet to receive the schedule of the centres. Around 800 students from 25 trades will appear for the online exam."
