NAVI MUMBAI:   police have arrested a 14-year-old boy for allegedly murdering a 22-year-old youth with whom he shared a rented accommodation in Jasai village, Uran taluka, about 20 km from  . The boy allegedly used a hammer to brutally assault the victim multiple times causing his death from grievous head injuries. 

 While the accused claimed that he had attacked the youth to avenge an assault by him a week ago, the police probe has revealed that the boy robbed the victim of Rs 11,000 which he had received as his monthly salary.
 
 The deceased has been identified as   (22), who worked as a dumper driver and hailed from Jharkhand. The minor was employed as a helper at a garage in Jasai village.
 
 Inspector Nagraj Majage said, "The boy repeatedly assaulted Mahato using a hammer when he was sleeping in the afternoon on Friday in their room. Then he left for work as usual. When a tailor in the neighbourhood visited their room to meet Mahato for some work, he found the man lying in a pool of blood and immediately informed the Uran police station. The cops rushed the victim to Uran rural hospital where he was declared brought dead on arrival."
 
 Inspector Majage said when the victim's roommate was questioned, he pretended not to know anything. "But he was the prime suspect. Upon inquiry we learnt that the victim had received Rs 11,000 as salary in cash a couple of days ago . That was missing from the room," said the inspector. 
 
 On questioning, the suspect confessed he had attacked Mahato with a hammer, saying he did so because he wanted to settle scores. "Mahato had beaten him up and caused injuries on his face," said the officer.
 
 The victim's wallet with Rs 11,000 cash in it was recovered from the accused. 
 
 The boy was arrested on Friday and booked for murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code. He has been sent to a juvenile remand home at Karjat since he is a minor.
