BHUBANESWAR: More than 100 primary health centres (PHCs) in the state don't have a single doctor posted there. According to government norms, these hospitals should have at least one doctor each. 

 Out of the sanctioned 5,377 posts of doctors, as many as 1,308 posts are lying vacant in these hospitals, a written reply by health minister Pradip Amat in the ongoing budget session of the assembly reveals. 
 
 The health department runs over 1,200 PHCs, 377 community health centres (CHCs), 27 sub-divisional hospitals (SDHs), 30 district headquarters hospitals (DHHs) besides Capital Hospital and  , which have total 8,373 hospital beds.
 
 Quoting the Indian Public Health Standard (IPHS) guidelines, the minister said the state should have 6,315 allopathic doctors. It currently has 4,069 in position, he said.
 
 A government officer said the posts of doctors in CHCs have been filled up on priority because these are fairly distributed across the state and have better infrastructure, taking bulk of the patient load. Sources said many doctors posted in PHCs were deputed in district headquarters hospitals associated with the two upcoming medical colleges at   and Koraput where the government intends to start MBBS admission this year rendering the PHCs without doctors.
 
 Nirakar Bhatt, president of   (OMSA), a body of doctors in government sector, said the government has been unable to improve the vacancies in hospitals because of concerted efforts to attract and retain doctors. Last year, chief minister   approved a proposal for restructuring of cadres, increasing the number of posts to 6,719 and creating more promotional avenues for the medicos. However, the proposal is yet to be implemented, which is frustrating, said Bhatt.
