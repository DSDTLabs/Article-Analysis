  With the move, the MLAs — Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer of Barnala, Pirmal Singh Khalsa of Bhadaur and   of   — have lent support to residents of six villages in the district who have been opposing the plaza on  . 
 
 Some days ago, the MLAs met the deputy commissioner and appealed to him to take a step for shifting the proposed site for the plaza to Barnala-Moga road, which is being widened. Residents of the six village have said they would have to pay the tax for just using a 2km stretch of the highway. They have also said the plaza should be constructed beyond Pakho, on the Moga highway. 
 
 Barnala DC Dharampal Gupta said they would meet the public works department (PWD) minister on Tuesday to discuss the issue. “Technical aspects are being looked into to resolve the issue,” he said.
