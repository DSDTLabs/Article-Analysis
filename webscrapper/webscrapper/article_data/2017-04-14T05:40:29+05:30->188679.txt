AHMEDABAD: As a host of festivals including  ,  ,   and  , among others, are falling around the weekend, airfares to certain destinations have shot up significantly. Tour operators claim that travellers who are homeward bound from Ahmedabad during these festivals tend to book their tickets well in advance. However, even bookings made a month ago tend to be cost more than usual by an estimated 20%.

 Explaining the phenomenon, Shravan Gupta, executive director of a travel company said, “Airfares have soared up to 35%-40% for the upcoming long weekend on sectors like Delhi, Agra, Jaipur, Cochin and Trivandrum, and are almost double for Goa.”
 
 “This weekend is particularly a super busy time to travel owing to summer vacation. As compared to last year, this time, we have seen a rise of 26% (approx) in bookings to these destinations,” Gupta said.
 
 “We have seen a significant uptake in the airfares for flights to northern parts of India. There is absolutely no scope for last-minute travellers to get flights cheaper, as prices are significantly high especially for destinations in North India,” said Manish Sharma, president of a city-based travel agency.
 
 “I will be travelling to Kochi for New Year Celebrations. However, I made my bookings around Diwali and hence got a good bargain. Otherwise, it would have been expensive,” said C Rajkumar, a city-based professional.
