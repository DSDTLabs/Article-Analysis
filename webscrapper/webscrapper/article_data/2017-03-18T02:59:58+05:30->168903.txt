NEW DELHI: When Babli Gautam got her husband — a heart patient — discharged from a private hospital in Agra and rushed him to  , she was banking on the institute’s reputation of providing affordable world-class treatment to even those with meagre resources.

 But Gautam’s hopes were dashed when she was told by guards that   were shut for the day as   had gone on a mass leave. The woman, in her late 40’s, ran from one entry point to another seeking help, even as her husband waited outside on a wheelchair. “He needs emergency surgery. Where should I take him?” she asked everyone — from security guards to doctors.
 
 Nutan Verma’s uncle, who suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, arrived at AIIMS from the Rajiv Gandhi Super-Specialty Hospital at Tahirpur in a CATS ambulance. But the ambulance wasn’t even allowed into the casualty area. The patient was later taken to Safdarjung Hospital.
 
  
  
 
 AIIMS’ main casualty wing gets 450   daily; on Friday, it did not accept any new case. The trauma centre, which deals with road traffic accidents and other emergencies, was shut too. Those already admitted were attended to by doctors, medical students and senior nurses who pitched in to tide over the crisis.
 
 Attendants of some patients admitted to the high-dependency unit complained of delays in getting medicines, while others said they had to change the position of the patient and monitor the ventilator themselves. “It was a crisis situation, but thankfully there wasn’t any mishap. We didn’t have to discharge any patient because of unavailability of nurses on Friday,” said a senior neurosurgeon.
