NEW DELHI: Former   R K Pachauri, facing allegations of sexually harassing an ex-woman colleague, will not have to seek court's permission anymore to go abroad, with a Delhi court on Thursday allowing his plea for discharge of surety. 

 In a span of two years during investigation since the FIR was filed, Pachauri was allowed to   over two dozen times. The court allowed his application for discharge of surety while considering an earlier order of the sessions court by which he could not leave the country without permission till the investigation was over.
 
  Directing that Rs 5 lakh furnished as surety by the accused be discharged, metropolitan magistrate   said, "It has been stated that as per order dated March 21, 2015, certain conditions were imposed upon the accused which included seeking prior permission of the court by him before leaving the country till investigation is over. Now chargesheet has been filed and investigation is over."
