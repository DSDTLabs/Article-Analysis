 Salem: Left with no other option, farmers of Vazhapadi taluk here are felling the   and selling them to brick kilns to be used as firewood, as the trees started to wither away in the sizzling sun in the absence of proper irrigation.
 
 “We don’t have water to irrigate the coconut trees,” said K Velayutham, one of the farmers in Belur. Talking to TOI, he said most trees had completely withered due to severe  .
 
 In Salem, coconut is largely cultivated in Vazhapadi taluk and in Pethanaickenpalayam union. The farmers here mainly depend on coconut business to make a living.
 
 Most coconut trees in the region were more than 70-year-old. They have started to wither away in the sizzling sun as there isn’t water for irrigation, said a farmer.
 
 The farmers said they haven’t enough money to dig new bore wells or find new water sources to irrigate the coconut trees. “We have to shell out close to Rs 2.50 lakh to dig a new bore well. Instead of spending the money for bore wells, we have decided to sell the coconut trees,” a farmer said.
 
 A tonne of coconut tree fetches these farmers Rs 1,200. “We will get at least Rs10,000 per tree,” said B Kalaichelvan, another farmer.
 
 Meanwhile, the brick kiln owners said they had been struggling for wooden logs to heat the wet bricks. “The farmers’ decision to sell coconut trees to us has come at the right time,” said a brick kiln owner.
