NEW DELHI: A   on Tuesday seized the passport of Congress leader   after it was revealed that he gave false information during its renewal. Tytler had allegedly claimed that no case was pending against him.

 Special Judge   gave   to the CBI, asking the agency for suitable action as he gave wrong information to the passport office that “no criminal case is pending against me”.
 
 Tytler’s counsel, however, told the court it was a bona fide mistake. He said the false information was given by his clerk who checked the wrong box on the form by mistake.
 
 CBI officials, on the other hand, informed the court that action should be initiated as the passport had been renewed without clearance from the court and in violation of rules.
