For eons, they have been told, “Girls make life worth living.” However, with more and more men opting for bromance over romance, the saying could now be altered to, “Bros make life worth living.” Independent studies in human behaviour even state that men express themselves more openly with their male friends than their female partners. Is this something women must worry about?  Women know that at the end of the day, in most cases, men will turn to them. But in recent years, youngsters have been debating over what lasts longer: bromance or romance, and whether or not the two can co-exist peacefully.
