DHARAMSHALA: The tragic news of the death of Major   (30), allegedly shot by a jawan following an argument early morning on Tuesday, has brought the celebratory mood of his family to a tearful end. The family, based at   village of Kangra district, had been celebrating the birth of his son as well as the completion of his new home.

 The officer had visited the family after the birth of his son, he was however yet to visit the family’s new-built house. The family was previously living in the Cheelgari area of Dharamshala and had shifted to their new home about a month ago.
 
 According to reports, Thapa had allegedly reprimanded   for using his mobile phone while on duty. This allegedly upset the jawan, who fired at Maj Thapa from behind, killing him on the spot. 
 
 Maj Thapa is survived by his father Arvind Thapa, an ex-soldier, who also worked as a teacher in the Himachal Pradesh education department, mother Poonam, wife Suvidha and three-and-a-half month old son  .
 
 “I too had served the Army. I can’t believe that a jawan can do this to his senior officer. He (Shikhar) had talked to his wife around 11pm on Monday, and he was shot around 12.15am today,” said Arvind, tears rolling down his face.
 
 Maj Thapa, a BTech engineer, belonged to 71 Armoured Regiment but was attached to 8 Rashtriya Rifles’ unit deployed in Uri, close to the Line of Control.
