New Delhi: Zakiya and Lalit, two Delhi children suffering from bilateral   loss since birth, may soon be able to hear.

 Delhi government has decided to provide financial assistance to their families to purchase cochlear implants, a tiny electronic device that can produce hearing in people with severe nerve deafness by electrically stimulating nerves inside the inner ear. The implant costs about Rs 5 lakh.
 
 Experts said that in the case of children born deaf, the younger the child the better the outcome, Ideally, the child should be less than five years of age. Zakiya is two and a half years old, while Lalit is four years old, said officials.
 
 “My husband works as helper in a cable wire company. We could not have afforded the implant on our own. I am happy that the government is extending help and hoping that surgery is done soon,” said Seema, Lalit’s mother. She had approached the state government for financial assistance through local MLA Kapil Mishra.
 
 The parents of Zakiya live in Seelampur are also poor. They too had approached the government for financial assistance.
 
 On Friday, chief minister Arvind   met both the children and their families and handed over cheques worth Rs 4.98 lakh to them for the cochlear implant surgery.
 
 “Kejriwal met the children and their parents at his residence and handed over the letter. He also asked the parents to take good care of the kids and come back to him in case they face any problem in future,” said an official, adding that the surgery is likely to be conducted within a week at Lok Nayak hospital.
 
 The government has given the funds under Delhi Arogya Kosh scheme. It covers life threatening disorders, heart and kidney ailments, cancer and any other disease or surgery that the governing body would term as life debilitating condition or disease.
