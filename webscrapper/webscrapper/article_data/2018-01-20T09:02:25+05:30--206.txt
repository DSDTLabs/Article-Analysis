PUNE: Owners of   in the city will be able to get them regularised till July according to the new state government directive.

 The   (PMC) will start accepting the proposals from Monday. The corporation has given 6 months’ time for submitting applications to compound  .
 
 The state urban development department in Oct 2017 had issued rules to regularise illegal structures on payment of a penalty. Illegal constructions done before December 31, 2015 in residential, commercial and industrial zones would be considered declared as “compounded structure” on payment of compounding charges.
 
 “Decisions on the proposals submitted to us will be taken on case by case basis. The compounding fees will be decided after considering the status of the building and may vary for each case,” said Prashant Waghmare, the city engineer of PMC.
  
  
 He said around 70,000 properties will benefit from the decision. The civic body is expected to earn Rs200 crore from the compounding fees.
 
 According to the state’s guidelines, structures would not face the danger of demolition once the owners or residents pay the charges. No new development would be permitted in such structures, though. Only maintenance works would be allowed. Reconstruction or redevelopment will be allowed only if the prevailing regulations permit it.
 
 The notification states that if an unauthorized construction is on a land reserved for public purposes it will be considered for regularization, provided the urban local body shifts the reservation to another plot or deletes it. The entity seeking regularization will need to pay the costs involved.
 
 The civic officials said property owners would have to pay for purchasing floor space index, compounding fee and infrastructure charges. According to the tentative estimates,   around 1,000sqft of illegal constructions will cost around Rs1.5 lakh.
