VADODARA: Mayor Bharat Dangar has approached the city police with a complaint that a conman had been exploiting his name to collect money from aspirants who wanted houses in the   (MGY) of the state government. The   (VMC) may also lodge an offence regarding the incident.

 Thakkar has stated in a letter to Dangar that he and three others had given Rs 80,000 each to Desai for a house in the   on Makarpura Road. Desai had claimed that he would be paying Rs 40,000 towards the booking amount of the houses and an equal amount as a bribe. The victims gave him Rs 2.2lakh through cheques and Rs 1lakh in cash. 
 
 Desai also used to boast about his connections in Gandhinagar.
 
 When Thakkar and others started inquiring about their houses, Desai sent them receipts from State Bank of Indiaâ€™s Wadi branch over Whatsapp. When Thakkar inquired with the bank, the officials there said that the receipts were fake.
 
 Thakkar confronted Desai with the information following which Desai refunded Rs 2.2lakh to him and the three others who had applied for the houses.
