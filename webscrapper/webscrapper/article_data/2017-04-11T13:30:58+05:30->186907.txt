INDORE: It's difficult to keep   out of news. It has emerged that the former India skipper is pitted against former   president N Srinivasan in the race to represent the BCCI at an important   meet in Dubai on April 24.

 'Dada', who was quite sought after by brands during his playing days, is still a hit among brands. During the   games at the MPCA Stadium, one can't miss the giant hoardings in which   is seen promoting a courier company which is the official logistics partner of Kings XI Punjab. The question is, can the 44-year-old, who's currently the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), still continue to endorse products as a Board official?
 
 As he's also a member of the  , can he promote the associate sponsor of an IPL team?
 
 "There's an ambiguity around these things, but actually when one is an administrator in the board, one should avoid all this. It's not right to sail in two boats. He's also a member of the IPL Governing Council," a top BCCI official told TOI on Monday. Ganguly is also an expert on a TV channel, and writes columns in newspapers.
 
 
 
 
 If there's been one jarring feature of IPL 10, it's the poor umpiring on show, which has marred many games, as the match officials have blundered on crucial occasions. On Sunday night, at the Wankhede, Mumbai Indians skipper   lost his cool after he was given out lbw despite getting a thick inside edge.
 
 It's learnt that the BCCI is concerned about the pathetic umpiring standard in the high-profile T20 tournament. It's learnt that the matter is likely to be discussed, and some sort of decision has been taken as IPL chairman   meet Board CEO Rahul Johri and Hemang Amin, the IPL-incharge. Poor umpiring has been an issue right through the Indian domestic season. After he was victim to a howler during the Irani Cup in January at CCI in Mumbai, India wicketkeeper   had lamented about how the same set of umpires are asked to officiate in important games.
