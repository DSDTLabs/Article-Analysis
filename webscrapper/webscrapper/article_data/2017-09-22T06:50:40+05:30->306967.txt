If there was one thing missing yesterday in TOI's comprehensive coverage of the record rain in the city and its aftermath, it was the name of the photographer who clicked the stunning front-page picture of a BEST bus submerged in the  . 

 Our photographers' team had sourced and verified the picture from reliable sources, but were unable to track down its owner in time. The shutterbug concerned is young  , who is pursuing a postgraduate degree in journalism with specialisation in New Media. A pucca Mumbaikar, Pranav, who loves to travel and wants to be a photo-journalist, said he was shocked to see the bus stranded in the middle of the subway around 10.04pm on Tuesday night. 
 
 "My first reaction was: Whatever happened to the passengers?" He was relieved when he found out that they had been safely evacuated.
 
 We apologise for missing out on Pranav's byline the first time around and wish him luck in his endeavours.
