Trichy: Police are yet to make any arrests in the case filed against 14 people for assaulting six youths belonging to Scheduled Castes in   a few days ago despite invoking various sections of the Prevention of Atrocities against SC/ST Act 2015. 

 While the police claimed that the clash was over a petty issue and both the communities had come for a compromise, a section of dalit community members said that they were threatened to withdraw their complaint. 
 
 Hailing from   village in   taluk, P Manikandan along with five others belonging to SC community had petitioned the collector on Tuesday claiming to have been assaulted by members of an upper caste community at   village on January 31. Paramasivam, the father of Manikandan, claimed that the upper caste members were forcing them to withdraw the case. 
 
 Speaking to TOI over phone, Pudukkottai district superintendent of police S   confirmed that a case had been registered in the   police station against 14 people though arrests had not been made since investigation was on. “The issue between the two communities occurred during an ‘annadanam’ event on January 31. A detailed inquiry is on to find out what happened on the said day resulting in clash between the people belonging to these two communities,” he said.
