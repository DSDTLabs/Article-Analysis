Secunderabad: The Secunderabad Cantonment Board (SCB) has set a record among 62 cantonments in the country by completing the process of alloting new house numbers. There are eight civilian wards under SCB and on Friday, the authorities fixed the last door number in ward No. VIII.

 The last time the house numbers were given was about 50 years ago. The new numbers will help in easy identification of houses, shops and commercial establishments in the cantonment limits.
 
 The SCB launched the work seven months ago and completed it within the scheduled time. “This is a major achievement. It is easier for us now to collect property tax, water tax and other taxes,” SCB chief executive officer SVR Chandra Sekhar told TOI. tnn
