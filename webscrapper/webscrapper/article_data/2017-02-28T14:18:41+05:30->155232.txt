ROHTAK: The call to observe a black day given by   (Aijass) on Sunday was marred by   by a group of   near Hisar’s Ramayan village sit-in. The incident happened when a section of protesters broke the barriers near the Ramayan village sit-in on the Hisar-Jaipur rail line on Sunday. The incident led to tension in the area, following which police and paramilitary forces rushed to the spot, accompanied by Aijass members. The barrier was closed for passage of goods trains from Hisar to Bhiwani around 1pm.

 The matter was brought to light after Samiti members persuaded protesters to clear the track. However later, the Samiti refused to accept responsibility of protesters who smashed the rail barriers. Shifting the blame on the government, Samiti leaders said protesters were covering their faces, and might have been sent to upset the ongoing peaceful sit-in at Ramayan village in Hisar district. “They were not our people, we are doing a sit-in peacefully,” said Ram Bhagat Malik, district president of the Samiti in Hisar. Hisar deputy commissioner   and SP Rajender Meena also rushed to the spot, followed later by Hisar range inspector-general OP Singh.
 
 Despite all the chaos, the sit-in at Hisar continued with speeches of Samiti leaders appealing to protesters to assemble for the March 2 Jantar Mantar protest in Delhi. Hisar DC Nikhil Gajraj told media that the situation was under control, and all roads and rail routes were clear of obstacles. SP Rajender Meena said 15 paramilitary forces and Rapid Action Force men were deployed to maintain law and order, adding that no one would be allowed to take the law into their hands.
