LUCKNOW: With BJP having fielded its candidate for the 10th   seat despite lack of numbers, political parties have drawn up strategies to keep their flock together and to get support for their candidates.

 While CM   has called a meeting of all party MLAs at his residence on Wednesday evening to chalk out the party’s strategy, SP chief   will hold a dinner at a city hotel.
 
 While the Opposition camp was trying its best to make up for SP’s Hardoi MLA Nitin Agarwal, who has announced to support BJP candidate, BJP ally   (SBSP), with four MLAs, has been sulking for quite some time. Its chief and minister   stayed away from Yogi government’s anniversary celebration. But he was pacified after a meeting with Amit Shah in Delhi on Tuesday. With Rajbhar on his side, Yogi called a meeting of party MLAs at his residence on Wednesday to discuss the strategy to make sure that the party’s 10th candidate Anil Agarwal win. The party is looking for support from Independent MLAs as well.
