Ludhiana: The police have decided to get strict with traffic violators at Punjab Agricultural University. 

 On Tuesday afternoon, cops booked a PAU college student for driving an SUV with tinted glasses on the campus. His vehicle, which they found parked outside MS Randhawa library, was also impounded.
 
 The PAU police later conducted a meeting with the university estate officer to chalk out a plan to better traffic management and ensure rules’ adherence on the campus. 
 
 PAU police station SHO inspector Birj Mohan said, “The police often challan traffic violators at PAU. But now, we have decided to step up vigil and get stricter.” 
 
 A slew of measures will be taken up. 
 
 “Campaigns will be organised to make students aware of traffic rules and strict action will be taken against violators. At present, one PCR is deployed on the campus. Soon, more PCRs will patrol the university. We decided on these measures during a meeting with the university estate officer,” the SHO added. 
 
 PAU estate officer Vishavjeet Singh said, “Entry of outsiders’ vehicles will be checked and use of two-wheelers and cycles promoted. We also plan to strengthen public transport facility on the campus. The plans will be finalised after a meeting with the vice-chancellor.”
