After 18 years, actors   and   are coming together in director   Chandar’s upcoming film, Sketch. The duo was last in Bala’s Sethu, whose combination scenes in film, which were shot in a college, were quite a hit among the audience back then. 

 And now, director Vijay has again roped in Sriman to play a key role in the film. A source in the know says, “Sriman has a pivotal role and will sharing screen space mostly with Vikram. Interestingly, the duo has shot their portions together again for this film, Sketch, in the same house in Egmore (popularly known as the Store House), where they had shot for Sethu 18 years ago.” 
 
 The source adds, “Both the actors know each other for several years as they are from the same dance school. So, it was easy to get that camaraderie cracking on the set again.” We also hear that Vikram recalled some fond memories while filming and was seen bonding with the actor. The team, we hear, is presently shooting for an action sequence in the city.
