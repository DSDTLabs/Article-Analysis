Vadodara: ‘Make in India’ will get a boost from Goods and Services Tax (GST), said Dr Hasmukh Adhia, revenue secretary, Government of India, here on Saturday.

 Adhia was in the city to address hundreds of traders and businessmen at a conference on GST organized by Federation of Gujarat Industries (FGI) and chief commissioner of Central Excise, Customs and Service Tax at Sir Sayajirao Nagar Gruh.
 
 “With implementation of GST, Indian manufacturers will benefit as there will be a level playing field for both domestically produced goods and imported goods,” said Adhia. He added that the US’s Federal Reserve had appointed two economists to study GST and according to their research, India’s growth will increase by 4.2 per cent if GST is implemented.
 
 Adhia told the audience that all systems are in place for GST and the government is committed to rolling it out on July 1. “Once GST is implemented, everything will be automatic – from registering to filing return to getting refund – people will not have to go to government offices to get their work done,” he said. The transition from the current system to GST will also be smooth, said Adhia. “All those who have bought stocks under current tax regime will get input tax credit if they have VAT and excise vouchers. Even those who do not have vouchers will be able to get 40 per cent presumptive input tax credit,” added Adhia.
 
 On the occasion, a help desk on GST at FGI was also inaugurated by deputy chief minister Nitin Patel.
