NAVI MUMBAI: Some of the   who are away on vacation or holidaying at their native place will be reaching the city by Wednesday to cast their vote. Few cut short their trip to ensure that they are present for voting. 

 One   has arrived all the way from Dubai to vote while one turned up from Oman and cut short his vacation to exercise their voting rights.
 
 Kharghar voter Sheetal Kumbhare from Dubai said, “My relative is in the poll fray. So I came here to cast my vote in ward no 4.”
 
 Vivek Padhye, who works in Oman, said, “I came to India to cast my vote.” Though Padhye was vacationing in Manali, he has ensured that he is back to cast his vote. 
 
 A voter, hailing from Barauli in Uttar Pradesh , Saurabh Pathak could not make it though. “I tried for a train ticket even via Tatkal but failed,” he said. 
 
  secretary SH Kalawat said, “Keeping in mind summer vacation and other factors that may lead to low voter turnout, we requested that polling should be held in June. But our plea was ignored.”
