NEW DELHI: Chief minister   and his deputy   will take part in a public hearing being organised on Sunday by the   in   to deal with residents' complaints about a liquor shop in the area. 

 The meeting is expected to put to test a standard operating procedure (SOP) prepared by the excise department to make way for public opinion in the operation of  . As per the proposal, if "nuisance in public spaces" is established, action will be taken as per law. SOP is also seen as a warning to licence-holders operating private liquor vends. 
 
 Sisodia has pointed out that each polling booth would be the base and if complaints were received about a liquor shop, a public meeting would be called. According to the SOP proposal, if 100 voters from that booth propose in writing to the department that they don't want the shop, the department will serve it a notice seeking explanation. This will be followed by an inspection to check compliance of licence conditions and, if public nuisance is established, the shop may also be shut. 
 
 Highlighting the need for such a system, Sisodia said, "SOP has to be implemented and it will be implemented." On Sunday, the complainants as well as the liquor shop operator would be heard to get an overall picture. "A discussion can lead to solutions," Sisodia said. "SOP is certainly a way to get people to express their view and we will make a beginning on Sunday," the deputy chief minister added. 
 
 When the 2016 excise policy was getting finalised, the Delhi government had sought to introduce a mohalla sabha-like model in it to decide if a liquor shop should be permitted in a residential area. It was proposed that the decision of the sabha would be binding on the district magistrate and the excise department. However, this was never implemented as the mohalla sabha plan itself failed to take off after running into a hurdle with the LG's office.
