Day three of the Lakmé Fashion Week Summer /Resort 2017 had celebs pouring in. Indian techniques and textiles blended with chic international silhouettes dominated the ramp. The day began with Sohaya Misra unveiling a variety of deconstructed ensembles with frills, floor length jackets, accent sleeves, asymmetrical skirts and dresses. Farah Sanjana’s resort wear line was an explosion where modern met baroque while MadSam Tinzin’s collection presented a nice mix of culture and fashion. The next show had Divya Sheth’s artistic merger of   paintings and Frida Kahlo’s surreal art. Monica Shah and Karishma Swali presented their signature style aimed at the millennial woman. The TagFree show was the talk of the day for which 23 celebrities rocked the ramp, as they strutted down in creations by seven individual designers. 

 Opulence and wearability came together in Radhika Jain’s showcase of jewellery, while Eishita made statement pieces the centre of her unconventional designs. Wearable, stylish, contemporary and youthful,   worked on the latest trends and colours to give women’s wear a fusion of fabrics, craft and tradition.
 
 When   strode down the ramp in an electric blue ensemble by TagFree, prejudices and stereotypes based on bodytypes took a major beating.
 
 Kiara Advani rocked Farah Sanjana’s baroque-meets-modern resortwear. That twirl was right on point.
 
 Karishma Tanna’s Splash gown, which was a combination of a sequinned top and a mesh bottom, made a ‘fabulous’ point.
 
 Nimrat Kaur definitely upped the ante in a lush wine lehnga by Sonam and Paras Modi, that boasted of decadent zari work. She looked grandeur personified.
