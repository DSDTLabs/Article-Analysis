GURUGRAM: Parents agitating against fee hike and the alleged lack of transparency in two of the city’s schools met   D Suresh on Tuesday, in a last-ditch effort to get their wards re-admitted to school.

 The parents whose children from  , had been turned away by the school over non-payment of annual fee, have alleged that they have been “gagged” by the divisional commissioner from speaking to press or “publicising” the issue on social media. Parents said they were asked by the commissioner to pay all the arrears. 
 
 Meanwhile, at least 100 parents from Shiv Nadar School also gathered outside the DC office on Tuesday. “Shiv Nadar School is a non-profit organisation. Over the last four years it has hiked the fee by 65%,” said a parent. The divisional commissioner said, “We are awaiting guidelines from the Fee and Fund Regulatory Committee based on which we shall decide our further course of action.”
