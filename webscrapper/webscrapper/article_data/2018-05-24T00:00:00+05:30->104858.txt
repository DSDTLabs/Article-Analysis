After her gritty turnout in  , actor   is now prepping up for another intense role that has been specially written with her in mind. The film is   and director   confirms that it was Nivedita alone that he had in mind while penning the script for this film which sees   in the lead. 
“I’ve known Smita ever since she did Avva and have always liked her work. The film is about life and its various shades and Nivedita’s role is like a mirror to Dhananjaya’s character, you can get an insight into his feelings through her. In Bollywood, actors like Kangana or Vidya Balan would be the kind to essay such roles and back home, it’s Nivedita who would be able to portray such intensity on screen. Her character is called Devika and I must say I’ve enjoyed writing the nitty gritties of her role. So much so, that when we go on floors, we’ll be shooting the climax first; that’s how detailed her character has turned out to be and I myself was pleasantly surprised to see that,” shares Suri. 
 Nivedita of course is on cloud nine. “Suri has a been on top of my list of must-work directors and I’m glad it’s happened. Just the one line that he mentioned about Devika left me intrigued. I know what a compelling character she is going to be. I am raring to get started on the film now,” sums up Nivedita.
 Interestingly, Suri got the title of his film from his 6-year-old son. “He keeps making up stories all the time and when I ask for the title, he says Popcorn, Monkey, Tiger. I felt it would be apt to sum up a film about life — Popcorn refers to the past, Monkey is future and Tiger is the present,” says Suri.
