MUMBAI: Cuffe Parade residents, who have vociferously spoken up against chopping of trees in their locality for Metro-III, are aghast that the authorities have sought permission to continue construction work for the project right through the night. 

 One of the residents,  , a lawyer by profession, plans to file a petition as his school-going daughters already find it difficult to sleep due to late-night construction work. 
 
 Currently, civil work for the metro corridor is permitted between 5am and 10pm, allowing for seven hours of respite. Now, though, the Mumbai   (MMRDA) has sought relaxation in noise pollution rules to extend metro work hours for faster completion of the project.
 
 Jaisinghani, who lives in the building opposite the space where dozens of trees were recently chopped, said, "My school-going daughters need to wake up early to leave home by 7am. If the metro work continues right through the night, how will they get sleep?" 
 
 Hacking of trees for the Metro-III project that began near Colaba Woods garden continued till the Cuffe Parade residence of Jaisinghani. "A huge portion of the area was already cleared of all the trees before the high court restrained the authorities from further chopping," he said. 
 
 Meanwhile,  , another Cuffe Parade resident, said that though her room does not face the road, where construction work is on, the noise is "very audible". "It affects senior citizens the most, like my mother who is 86 years old. Her room faces the road. It's awful to think that this noise will continue day and night for many more years till work is complete," said Kriplani. 
 
 Pervin Jehangir, another Cuffe Parade resident, who was a part of the team that met chief minister   on Monday and MMRCL authorities on Tuesday, said the authorities must put up sound barriers.
