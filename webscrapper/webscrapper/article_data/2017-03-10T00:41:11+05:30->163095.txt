MUMBAI: The police have arrested a woman from Gujarat and her father-in-law for submitting forged documents along with her visa application. The fraud came to light when Ankitaben Prajapati (23) visited the US consulate to get her   stamped to travel to the US to be with her husband, who works there.

 The police suspect the accused used a fake marriage certificate and a copy of the passport of a man who was not her husband. Prajapati and her father-in-law, Sanjaykumar (60), were sent to judicial custody.
 
 The consulate had called Prajapati for the visa interview around 4pm on Tuesday. She submitted some documents, which included her marriage certificate, that showed she was married to a man employed in the US for the last few years.
 
 “During the interview consulate officials found discrepancies in her reply, which made them verify the documents,” an officer at the   said. 
 
 The police said the woman might have used forged documents as her husband could have gone to the US on forged documents. In the complaint, the consulate said: “We found discrepancies in the documents submitted by Prajapati for obtaining   stamped. Some of the documents of the man whom Prajapati claimed to be her husband did not match her claims. During interrogation she broke down and revealed the forgery.”
 
 The consulate handed over Prajapati and her father-in-law to the police. They were produced in the   on Wednesday.
 
 The police said they were on the lookout for the agent who had helped Prajapati obtain the fake documents.
