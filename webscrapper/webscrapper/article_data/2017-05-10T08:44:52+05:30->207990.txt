 CESS professor E Revathi, who is the coordinating officer for the training, told TOI that the students would be divided into a groups of four, comprising two boys and two girls. "Each team will visit eight households every day in the selected villages and collect details such as from where does the family get drinking water, what is the distance, what amount is spent, the time women and adolescent girls spend in fetching water, and most importantly, whether girls had to drop out of schools just to get water, and how much is spent for treatment of water-borne diseases," she said. 
 
 After two-and-half years, another survey would be taken up to ascertain the socio-economic impact of the project. This survey will ascertain whether the supply of safe drinking water changed their lives, whether their income increased, whether the girls were able to go to schools regularly as they did not need to go long distances to fetch water.
 
 Surender Reddy said students would be given a certificate after the training. They would be paid about 750 per day during the study period. Another certificate would be given after completion of the survey.
