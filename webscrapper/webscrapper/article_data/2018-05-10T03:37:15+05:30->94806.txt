He further said possible donors were available depending upon matching of the parameters.
 
 The man claimed he was initially getting treatment at Vellore and later on admitted to ILBS on April 6 and he had paid around Rs 2 lakh in the hospital by April 22. Kumar's plea said the hospital asked him to deposit Rs 15 lakh for liver transplant and when he expressed inability to pay such a hefty amount, he was asked to leave. Kumar maintained he and his family have sold everything including their house for his treatment, but can't arrange such a sum for treatment.
 
 He was then taken to another hospital where he was admitted under EWS category but doctors advised him to undergo liver transplant at the earliest.
