Trichy: A massive fire which broke out at a footwear godown in Thanjavur city late on Saturday night destroyed goods reportedly worth around Rs 50 lakh. 

 The godown is located on the first floor of a three-storey building at Arulanandham Nagar in Thanjavur city. A footwear showroom is also located on the ground floor of the building. Two finance companies also function on the same floor.
 
 Police said the employees, while they were winding up the dayâ€™s sales, noticed smoke emanating from the godown. They went and checked the room but by then the fire had engulfed the entire room. The employees alerted the fire and rescue services department in Thanjavur. A team of fire fighters rushed there, disconnected the power supply, and attempted to douse the fire which had almost destroyed the entire material stocked in the godown, police sources said. 
 
 In the meantime a team of police officials headed by deputy superintendent of police Thamizhselvan also rushed to the spot and regulated traffic movement. As the fire fighters from Thanjavur struggled to put out the fire, another team from Thiruvaiyaru was brought in. The two teams managed to douse the fire after two hours of struggle. 
 
 Police sources said goods worth Rs 50 lakh were destroyed in the fire. Short circuit in an air conditioning unit may have caused the fire, said a police officer involved in the investigation. Further investigations are on.
