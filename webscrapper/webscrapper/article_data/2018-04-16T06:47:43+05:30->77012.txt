JAIPUR: Over 500 members of civil society participated in a candlelight march   against the Kathua, Unnao and Sasaram rape incidents at   in Jaipur on Sunday. While raising slogans ‘we want justice’ and ‘hang the rapist’ while lighting candles, the protesters urged the central government to bring a stricter legislation for rape and crime against juveniles.

This is for the first time Rabbani has attended any protest march. “From the past one week, I have been hearing stories about the rape incidents. A section of people supporting accused of a gory crime has shaken me to the core. I am glad to be here and raised my voice against the crime,” said Rabbani, while lighting candles.
 
 The march was schedule at statue circle at 6pm. However, the police prevented the protesters for assembling at statue circle citing the imposition of article 144. The police told the protesters to hold march at Amar Jawan Jyoti. Here the protesters paid tributes to all the rape victims. Shastri Koslendra Das, a priest and academician while addressing the crowd said that Kathua has shaken the conscious of every India. “We are living in a difficult time. Every Indian should rise about the barrier of caste, gender and religion to fight bigotry,” said Das.
 
 Police stopped the protesters for using mini loudspeakers despite the organizers request them for using it for passing instructions. A student, Surendra Makwana held civil society responsible for rising hate crimes in the society. “The silence of civil society is encouraging the fringe to commit such brazen crimes. This is high time that civil society members should speak up against those who violate the spirit of constitution,” said Makwana who came with his 10 friends. Many speakers expressed their concern on rising incidents of rape in the state.
