PATNA: The   called off their   on Wednesday following assurance from governor   to look into their demands.

 Around 72,000 home guards, including 32,000 who are deployed on active duty, had been on an indefinite strike since March 15 in support of their demands, including equal pay for equal work. Earlier, several rounds of talks with home department principal secretary  , DG (home guard) PN Rai and other officials of the state government had failed to break the stalemate as the jawans said their demands were based on the   ruling. The Patna high court had also directed the state government last year to pay the jawans in the light on the Supreme Court order.
 
 “The governor assured us that he would act on our demand very soon,” said Bihar Home Guard Association general secretary Sudeshwar Prasad, adding that the governor assured a delegation which met him after the home guards were stopped from marching towards the Raj Bhavan from Gardanibagh on Wednesday.
 
 The delegation comprising the association’s state president Arun Kumar Thakur, acting president Deshbandhu Azad, vice-president Kanhaiya Rai and member Avinash Kumar had a meeting with the governor for at least 45 minutes, Prasad said.
 
 “The delegation submitted the memorandum of demands of equal pay for equal work on par with Bihar police personnel and 365 days duty. At present, the home guard jawans get daily remuneration of Rs400 in comparison to Rs900 paid to the police personnel for same kind of duty,” Azad said. 
 
 Earlier, principal secretary (home) had clearly said the Supreme Court’s ruling didn’t apply on Bihar as Punjab and West Bengal were respondents in that case. He had also said that punitive action would be taken against the agitating jawans if they failed to call off their strike.
