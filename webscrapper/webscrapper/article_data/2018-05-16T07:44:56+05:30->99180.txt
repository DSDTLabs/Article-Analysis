PATNA: Police on Tuesday rescued Rahul Kumar (16), son of local trader Ranjeet Sao, barely six hours after he was kidnapped from Gandhi Nagar Colony under Rajiv Nagar police station area around 12.30pm. The boy, who was kidnapped while returning from his father’s shop, was rescued from Veer Kunwar Singh Park under   police station area here. The three kidnappers were also arrested.

 Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said the kidnappers had demanded a ransom of Rs 3 lakh from Sao for the safe release of his son.
 
 The three arrested kidnappers have been identified as Mohammad Shahrukh and Rajeet Kumar of Rajiv Nagar and Mohammad Mihnaz of Shashtri Nagar, all in their early 20s. Police also recovered a country-made pistol, a cartridge and three cellphones from the possession of the arrested criminals.
 
 “The boy was taken to multiple locations by the kidnappers. His family members had informed the police about the incident around 3.30pm and the boy was rescued from the park at 6.30pm,” the SSP said.
 
 Sources said a liquor smuggler was recently arrested by the police on the basis of information provided by Sao. Police have not ruled out the possibility of the involvement of liquor mafia in the kidnapping of Sao’s son. “We are probing the case from various angles,” a senior police officer said.
