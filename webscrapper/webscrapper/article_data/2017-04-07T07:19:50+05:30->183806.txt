KOLKATA: That's the puzzle that kept the city engaged on an overcast Thursday. The cloud build-up in the late afternoon and evening was impressive, prompting some to hurry home from office. But in the end, it was disappointing as the rain remained elusive.

 The weatherman's forecast isn't too encouraging. No rain is expected in the next couple of days. But there is a sliver of hope for a light shower on Sunday .
 
 A low-pressure trough that extended 1,500 km from Punjab to   led to cloud activity in the entire eastern region, including Kolkata and rest of  . Thus, it was overcast since morning, with cloud cover over Kolkata and neighbouring areas in   and South 24 Parganas.Though they looked dark and ominious, these clouds at the tail of the trough were dry. The city remained hot and sultry all day long with the maximum temperature of 31.8°C, four notches below normal.
 
 “The next 48 hours will remain cloudy and gloomy but don't expect rain,“ G K Das, the director of the   at Alipore, warned. “There might be some rain and thundershower after that but it is only a possibility at this time.“
 
 Jharkhand and adjoining districts of the state have, however, been experiencing thundershowers with Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan and Birbhum reciving sporadic rainfall to keep the sizzling temperature in check. The Met office has forecast the spell will continue for at least a couple of days more. This March was the wettest in Kolkata in a decade. The city normally has four wet days in March but it has been fewer in recent years. This time, the city has already had five rainy days. But it was not a squall every time. A storm must be accompanied by wind blowing at a speed of at least 45 kmhr to qualify as a squall. “We had squalls on March 10 and 11.The rest have been thundershowers but they have come in a series that is now rare in March. It has pushed the mercury down,“ added Das.
