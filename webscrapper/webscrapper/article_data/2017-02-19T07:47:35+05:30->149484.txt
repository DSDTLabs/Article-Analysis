THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Former chief minister   has been named as the fourth accused in the Pattoor land encroachment case by the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau (VACB).

 The agency has filed an FIR against five people, including Chandy and former chief secretary E K  . 
 
 While the first and the second accused are   officials, the third accused is Bharat Bhushan and the fifth accused is T S Asok, managing director of Artech Realtors. 
 
 The FIR was submitted in the vigilance court here on Saturday. 
 
 Earlier in the day, VACB’s legal advisers had advised the agency that a case can be registered though the matter was pending before the Lokayukta. 
 
 The agency had to face severe criticism from the court after it submitted before the court on the basis of another legal advice by the deputy director of prosecution (vigilance) that it cannot register a case since another case in this regard was pending before the Lokayukta. 
 
 The agency had claimed that the Section 9 (7) of the Kerala Lokayukta Act, 1999, says that “the conduct of an investigation under this act against a public servant in respect of any action shall not affect such action or any power or duty of any other public servant to take further action with respect to any matter subject to investigation”. 
 
 However, on February 9, the court asked the agency to complete the investigation and submit the FIR in 15 days. 
 
 Advocate general C P Sudhakara Prasad had also recommended the agency that there was no bar in registering an FIR in the Pattoor case. 
 
 The   chairman and CPM leader   had filed a petition in the vigilance court demanding an investigation the case. 
 
 The vigilance court had earlier observed that from the documents submitted before it, it was clear that the realty firm had encroached 16.98 cents in Pattoor.
