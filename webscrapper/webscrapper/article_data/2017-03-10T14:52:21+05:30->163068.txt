CALANGUTE:   are allegedly using identity proofs of locals to procure mobile sim cards in connivance with sim card retailers along the coastal belt, Calangute police said.

 PI Jivba Dalvi said the modus operandi came to light when the anti-narcotics cell ( ) of the Goa police was analyzing the call details of a Nigerian, Nnamuka Okafor, who had been arrested in connection with a case.
 
  It found that the phone number used by Okafor was actually registered in the name of a local woman from Calangute. 
 
 The ANC subsequently instructed the Calangute police station to verify the details of the person in whose name the sim was registered.
 
 But, when the police approached the woman concerned, she denied having purchased the sim.
 
 When the retailer of the said sim card was investigated and the customer application form perused, it was found that the photo affixed was of an unidentified Nigerian national while the address was of the local woman. 
 
 Calangute police have registered an offence against retailer Omprakash Gupta, activation officer of   Deepak Moham, and sim card distributor Soham Enterprises, Mapusa, under IPC Sections 419, 420, 465, 468 and 471 read with 34. Further investigations are on. 
 
 It is suspected that many more such sim cards may have been sold to Nigerian   by the retailer.
