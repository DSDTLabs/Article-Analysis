The technique involves drawing   of colour or glitter wrapped around an exaggerated wing of your cat flick. Though this does take a steady hand, time and practice to get it right, once you master the super cool way to dress up our eye, your perfectly aligned black flicks will definitely seem boring.
The colours of the ribbon can range from sunset red to neon green and cobalt blue. For a unique touch, you can extend it to your brow or try it on a double-winged cat-eye.
