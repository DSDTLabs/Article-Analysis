Gurgaon: Residents of a condominium in DLF Phase 1 have sought permission from   to use the neighbouring   for waste management. 

 Situated along   road in DLF 1, Silver Oaks Apartments is spread over 14 acres and has 749 apartments along with 150 houses for economically weaker sections (EWS) and five shops. 
 
 The residents intend to take over an approximately 1,000 sq ft area along Gurgaon-Faridabad road to keep 20 bins for waste management, once the land is allotted to them. These will include separate bins for wet waste and leaves generated by the society, which will be composted in these bins. 
 
 “We’ve already started composting natural waste inside the complex, but we want to expand it. As garbage cannot be composted at such large scale inside the complex, we’ve sought permission from MCG to give us an area in the green belt where we can exclusively carry out waste management for our complex,” said Subhi Ayar, a resident. 
 
 Notably, the municipality had offered to set up a composting plant for the residents in April 2016, but the initiative was never implemented. 
 
 “We have no objection to handing over the area for a noble cause,” said  , senior town planner, MCG.
