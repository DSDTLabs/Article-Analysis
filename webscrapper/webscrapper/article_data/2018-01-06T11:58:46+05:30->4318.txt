NEW DELHI: Delhi   on Friday termed the failure of two corporations to pay   to their school teachers as “hopeless”.

 It ordered east and north civic bodies to clear their current month salary in a week and arrears in primary school in a month.
 
 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar expressed concern after East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) informed that it doesn’t have enough funds to pay the salaries and is poorest among the three corporations.
 
 “This is not a first plea in which EDMC has expressed inability to pay salaries. Earlier also, we heard about non-payments of salaries to EDMC’s safai karmacharis who went on strike on various occasions. This could not have been the intention of trifurcation of the MCD. If this is true, it needs serious examination by the authorities concerned, as every citizen of Delhi expects optimal services from the corporation,” the bench observed, pointing out that South Delhi Municipal Corporation is not facing such financial problems.
 
 The three corporations should be identically placed, the bench stressed, saying that the problem should be brought to the notice of the ministry concerned.
 
 HC was hearing a PIL filed by an NGO, Social Jurist, through its counsel Ashok Agarwal. It had urged HC to intervene saying that EDMC for the past three months has not paid salaries to primary schools’ teachers. It also alleged that North Delhi Municipal Corporation has not paid salaries to its regular teachers for the past two months.
 
 “Untimely payment of salaries to 13,500 regular teachers is affecting the primary education of lakhs of children studying in these schools,” the NGO submitted.
 
 HC said corporations should then hand over education department to Delhi government if they can’t pay teachers on time.
 
 The bench directed the two civic bodies to file their status report before the next date of hearing on April 23.
