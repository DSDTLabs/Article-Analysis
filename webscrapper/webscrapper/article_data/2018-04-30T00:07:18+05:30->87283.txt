Indore: Crime branch police on Sunday arrested two persons who had committed   at a house in Mhow and made away with   and jewellery. They have recovered Rs 80,000 cash and   worth Rs 20 lakh from their possession. 

 Police had received a complaint from a resident of Mhow and a dairy owner, Dilip Agarwal that unidentified persons broke into his house and made away with cash and jewellery when he had gone to attend a wedding along with his family members.
 
 At the crime scene, police officials had found that the accused had used a duplicate key to enter the house. Based on this, police suspected that someone known to the family members had committed the crime. 
 
 Police questioned all the workers of the dairy separately in which their statements were found to be different. Following this police questioned one Bhaiyyu alias Sahil, 26, a resident of Kesarbardi. He accepted to have committed the crime. 
 
 Bhaiyyu told police that he owed Rs 1 lakh to someone and needed money to repay the loan. He had therefore planned the entire theft. Bhaiyyu said that he knew where the complainant’s mother Jimanikbai kept the jewellery and so he had made a duplicate key of their house. 
 
 The accused had offered Amzad a 50% share in the entire amount and so he accompanied him in the crime. Amzad was also arrested on his statement. 
 
 Amzad told police that he had concealed Rs 50,000 at a burial ground in Kesarbardi area and was going to dig it up after a month and the remaining amount and jewellery were hidden by Bhaiyyu in the backyard of his house. 
 
 The accused had been working at the dairy for the past five years.“Both the accused were arrested and booked under relevant sections of the IPC,” said ASP Amrendra Singh.
