BENGALURU:   has claimed it has 100 million   compliant mobile wallet customers out of 220 million using its payments service. The Noida-based company has been able to make 45% of its m-wallet users KYC-compliant due to its aggressive offline drive. Paytmâ€™s total registered user base is over 300 million.

 
 After the RBI made KYC compliance mandatory for mwallets from March, most digital wallet players have been trying to get users to complete the process. Prior to the RBI directive, these companies had a small base of users who had completed their KYC. Others like   and   Pay have indicated the challenges they are facing following the RBI norm.
