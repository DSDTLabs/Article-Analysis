His love for the outdoors, especially biking and trekking, is quite obvious when you take a look at his feed on a picture-sharing platform. When not shooting,   is known to take off into the wild or hit the road with friends. This time around, the actor chose to return to his roots in Thirthahalli accompanied by his friends and cousins. “I’ve always loved being amidst nature and was always outdoors while growing up in Thirthahalli. I was at my happiest during those days. But once we moved to Bengaluru, I lost my connection with nature given the concrete jungle that we are part of. So, I never pass up an opportunity to go back when I get the time to do so,” says Diganth. Spanning across four days, the trip saw the group trek in the forests of Agumbe, hit the areca plantations in Sagara and ride through the peaceful lanes of Thirthahalli. “I rode on my bike and the rest of the gang followed me by car. We had such a wonderful time because none of us cared about luxuries and rejoiced in the simple pleasures of life. We sat under the waterfalls, went rock climbing and stepped into muddy waters...it was all about connecting with nature. It is where I feel at my best. Everybody should do these things once in a while; it keeps you grounded,” Diganth sums up. Atta boy!
