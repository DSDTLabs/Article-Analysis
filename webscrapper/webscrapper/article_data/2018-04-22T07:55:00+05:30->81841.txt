GURUGRAM: The district administration on Saturday kicked off a programme to reach out to   of rural areas in Gurugram.

  (DC) Vinay Pratap Singh visited   in the evening and held a public meet to address the grievances of residents. He also took a class on gender sensitisation at a government school and clicked selfies with students as part of the ‘selfie with daughter’ campaign. He will spend the night in the village as part of the rural outreach programme.
 
 Residents demanded that the girls’ government high school in Damdama should be upgraded as girl students often have to endure eve-teasing while travelling to schools in other villages. Notably, there are around 164 girl students in Damdama. Singh instructed the education officers to conduct a feasibility report on whether the schools can be upgraded. 
 
 The DC also told   that “a survey is being conducted to provide free-of-cost transportation service” to girl students to go to other places for higher education. The service may start from next month.
 
 Considering the cases of disputes among the villagers, he said that the villagers should realise that the division would disrupt the development works in the village. A total of 23 grievances were shared with him on Saturday. Around 19 government departments also organised assistance stalls for the residents of the five nearby villages, including Khedla, Behlapa, Sahjawas and Garhi Wajidpur. The stalls showcased various government schemes.
 
 The health department conducted free check-ups of the villagers and the education department organised sports activities for school-going children.
