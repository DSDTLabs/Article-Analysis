GUWAHATI: People from different walks of life got together in the city on Wednesday to extend their support for Shubh Laxmi, the college girl who put up a   post about being eve-teased. 

 They also condemned state transport minister Chandra Mohan Patowary for making 'callous' remarks on the girl. Patowary had not only criticized the girl for putting up her complaint on Facebook, he had dismissed her as a member of the Students' Federation of India (SFI).
 
 "She is a member of the SFI. She took a wrong step by posting her experience on a social networking site. She should have gone to police first," Patowary had told reporters earlier.
 
 "Such a remark by a minister is very unfortunate and insensitive. Now all of us should be united to provide justice to the girl," award-winning author Nirupoma Borgohain said while addressing the gathering.
 
 Authors, doctors, filmmakers, students and others took part in the protest on Wednesday and urged the people of the state to stand united for the cause of women's safety.
 
 The girl, a student of Jorhat's JB College, had drawn huge support on the social media site after she put up the post outlining her harrowing experience. Students and other organizations took to the streets seeking justice and safety for girls and women.
 
 The women's wing of Assam Pradesh   Committee also staged a protest on Wednesday seeking justice for   and Patowary's resignation.
 
 "Is this how the BJP government treats women? Patowary must apologize for his callous remarks or step down," said a Congress leader while shouting slogans on GS Road.
 
 Crime against women has increased at an alarming rate in the state. According to a government report, 22,223 rape cases were registered in the state from 2001 to May 2016. 
 
 A total of 1,922 women have lost their lives in the same period due to dowry-related issues. From June 2016 to January 2017, altogether 1,294 rape cases were registered and 97 women died due to dowry-related issues.
