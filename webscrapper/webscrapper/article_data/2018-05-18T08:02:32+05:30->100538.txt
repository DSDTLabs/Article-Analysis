BENGALURU: She held her first art exhibition in her apartment when she was in Class 9. That was a clear indication for the parents of   about her inclination. On Tuesday, this Bengaluru girl emerged as the all-India topper in the   ( ) 2018 (general category) entrance test.

 Sirigowri studied commerce with psychology in Sri Kumaran’s Children’s Home, Mallasandra campus, for higher secondary. “I was interested in psychology and I thought a combination with commerce would open many avenues. Psychology and design go hand in hand because we are designing for people and we must understand their choices and preferences,” she told TOI. Though she is second in the overall national ranking, she stood first in the general merit category.
 
 “She has always been inclined towards art,” said her father  , a techie. “She was good at arts, story-writing and painting since childhood. In high school, she wanted to pursue a different career,” he added.
 
 “I was aware of the branches of design, but didn’t know the scope of each stream. That’s why I joined Design Quotient Labs, a coaching institute where professional designers guided me to decide what exactly should I pursue in graduation,”   said.
 
 She is yet to decide whether to join   or Mumbai. “I applied for fashion communication because fashion defines us,” added Sirigowri, who dreams of putting up her show at  , the fashion capital, one day.
