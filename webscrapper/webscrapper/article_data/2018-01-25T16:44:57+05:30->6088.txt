PATNA: Bihar’s tableau will be missing from the 
  parade at Rajpath in New Delhi for the second consecutive time this year.

 Sources in information and public relations department said this year’s tableau was based on Chhath theme, but it could not impress the selection committee under the defence ministry. The ministry selects tableaus from different states and union territories depicting varied art, culture and heritage of the country.
 
 Last year also, the state’s tableau depicting Vikramshila, an ancient educational centre of the state, was rejected by the selection committee. 
 
 
 
 
 In 2016, the theme for the state’s tableau was Champaran Movement of 1917 and it was given   green signal by the defence ministry.
 
 Though Bihar will not be able to showcase its cultural heritage at the national level this year, the state government is gearing up for a grand   function at Gandhi Maidan here. 
 
 Sources in district administration said 12 tableaus of different departments are up for selection. The development commissioner will hold a meeting on Tuesday ahead of selection of tableaus for the Republic Day parade at Gandhi Maidan. Rehearsal for the programme will begin from January 11. 
 
 Meanwhile, divisional commissioner Anand Kishor has asked the officials concerned to install ten watch towers at Gandhi Maidan from security point of view. People cannot book Gandhi Maidan for commercial purposes between January 10 and 26. A human chain will also be formed at the Maidan on January 21 in support of elimination of social evils like dowry and child marriage.
 
 Entry of common people at Gandhi Maidan will be banned from January 15 to 26. Morning walkers, however, will be allowed to enter the ground till January 22.
