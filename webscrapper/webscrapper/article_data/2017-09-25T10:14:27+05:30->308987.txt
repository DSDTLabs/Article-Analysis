The civic body fixed several potholes at   chowk on   highway on a pilot project-basis using a new pothole repairing machine.   (PCMC) will hire the machine called Jet Patcher if the trials are successful.
Spokesperson of PCMC's   cell   said, “Two big potholes were repaired using the machine. We will wait for eight days to study the impact of heavy traffic on the repaired patches.We will then send a technical report to municipal commissioner  , who will decide about hiring the machine.“ Nashik Phata chowk was chosen for the trials as it is one of the busiest in the city, he added. “The machine can repair a patch measuring 1 metre by 2 metre at a time in 35 minutes. It can repair potholes under cloudy conditions when normal tarring cannot be done. The machine cannot repair potholes if the road is waterlogged or if it is raining,“ Bhojane added.
 
 Potholes have developed on many roads in various parts of the city. Civic officials fill the potholes with coarse soil (murum), but it scatters after some time.
 
 The spot is cleaned and the level of the pothole is made uniform. The machine is placed on this `levelled' surface. The selected spot is heated by the machine and then tar is placed on it. The machine is placed on the tar to melt it and level it. The entire repair work is completed in 30 to 35 minutes.
