 Actress   shares, "While for work I travel many cities but there's no city as   as Ahmedabad or Vadodara. One of the reasons I believe that makes our cities safe is that most number of people are employed here, be it people who have been living here or even migrants, there are job opportunities here. Another reason is that people are quite educated here and are aware of the consequences. Also one will never find the streets empty, from police men on patrol to locals people are always there to help us."
