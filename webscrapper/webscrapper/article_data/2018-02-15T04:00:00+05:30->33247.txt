Vadodara: The beleaguered Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd (DPIL), promoted by Amit Bhatnagar, is looking for financial institutions to invest in the debt-ridden company . 

 The group company has a debt of Rs 1,695 crore that it borrowed from the banks. After the quarterly board meeting on Wednesday, Bhatnagar said, “We have been looking for investors in our company over last 18 months.” 
 
 The group in total has debts of Rs 1,850 crore of which Diamond Power Infrastructure owes Rs 1,695 crore to the bank, Diamond Power Transformers Ltd owes Rs 120 crore, Diamond Infosystem owes Rs 2 crore and Northway Spaces has loans worth Rs 30 crore. A Mumbai-based financial institution had recently taken symbolic possession of a property owned by Northway Spaces after Diamond Power Transformers Ltd failed to repay a loan of Rs 33 crore. 
 
 Bhatnagar said that the matter was in court but he won’t be taking any further step against SICOM as of now. When asked about the heavy debts that his company is facing, Bhatnagar said that the assets of group companies are worth Rs 3,000 crore of which Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd has Rs 2,400 crore assets. In 2016, they had converted a portion of their loans worth Rs828.43 crores into equity shares. 
 
 The banks now own over 70% of the company’s shares apart from the 11% owned by the promoters (Bhatnagar family) that too have been pledged with the banks. While banks purchased the shares at Rs 41 a piece, the price of Diamond Power Infrastructure shares are over Rs 16 per share. Bhatnagar said that the banks as such cannot sell the shares till 2019 as there was a three-year lock-in period. 
 
 “The electric product manufacturing firms in the city have been reeling under heavy losses over last few years. After shifting to retail customers, our losses reduced from Rs 262 crore in third quarter of 2016 to Rs 29 crore in the same period in 2017,” he said.
