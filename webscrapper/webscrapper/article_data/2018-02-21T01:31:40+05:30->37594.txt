NEW DELHI:   and Carnatic singer   was at   on Tuesday to deliver the third annual A K   lecture. Apart from talking about his art and the impact of his upbringing on his thinking, Krishna also attacked  . 

 “Just by shouting against nationalism you won’t achieve much,” he said. But warned students not to succumb to the idea of nationalism as “it destroys everything else”. 
 
 Krishna praised the students for showing courage to organise the lecture at the same place where they had been attacked last year. He said he had been assertive himself, questioning why only upper-caste men design and manage music, and even sit in the audience. 
 
 Students felt things have changed since last year. “After the attack, we stood together and marched against violence. Some change did come but more needs to be done,” a history student said. But professor   said not much has changed.
