GURUGRAM: Two bodies were found on adjacent plots in Manesar on Monday morning. A 30-year-old construction worker allegedly killed his wife by hitting her on the head with a metal rod and hung himself using a rope on an adjacent plot, said police. 

 The couple was employed at a construction site on plot number 14 in Sector 5, Manesar, and lived in a shanty on the plot. Workers from the site found Sameer Ali’s body hanging from a tinshed in plot number 15 on Monday. When they reached the shanty to inform his wife  , they found her body in a pool of blood. The workers called the cops who recovered the bodies and alcohol bottles from the spot. 
 
 Cops are working on the theory that Ali killed himself, after killing Begum. Cops said her mouth was taped and that could be why neighbours did not hear anything, adding that the couple had a fight on Friday and workers had seen Ali drink on Sunday. An FIR was registered against Ali on the complaint of contractor Jitender Singh under Section 302 (murder) of IPC. The couple had been living in the area since November 2017, after migrating from West Bengal.
 
 Cops said the woman had been married to another man and had run away with Ali. Her family members claimed they hadn’t met Ali and was not in touch with her, cops said. Her brother will arrive in the city on Tuesday. About Ali’s family, inspector   of IMT Manesar police station said, “We couldn’t find his address but circulated his details and have identified the village he’s from. We are yet to inform the family.”
