NAGPUR: The ‘museum’ housed in Kishor Divekar’s flat in   has got another section devoted to photography, its related equipment and accessories. These objects which date back to the 18th and 19th centuries have been donated to the   by an 84-year-old photography enthusiast   who now lives in Mumbai.

 “His wife was a teacher in   where I studied too. It was a chance conversation through which Joglekar learnt about my museum and expressed his desire to have his collection exhibited here,” says Divekar. 
 
 The more than 50 pieces, which include cameras, flash lights and other accessories, were sent to Pune by Joglekar. “From there I got them to Nagpur and have devoted two sections to exhibit them,” he adds.
 
 Joglekar pursued photography which was his passion for over six decades. He loved to photograph wildlife, heritage structures, flora and birds. “He also used to conduct classes of photography in Mumbai and Pune. It was during his travels in India and abroad that he picked up innumerable cameras and related products. I feel my museum has benefited immensely from his contribution,” says Divekar.
 
 Joglekar came to Nagpur to set up the equipment at Divekar’s museum. “He spent three days putting the cameras on shelves and himself wrote down all the details and information of each piece. All the cameras are in working condition it is just that now camera films are not available any more,” says Divekar.
 
 The section can be of immense interest to those learning photography says Divekar. “Some very old cameras of companies like Belo and Yashica are part of this treasure. As I allow visitors to touch and feel the objects displayed, I think students of photography can gain a lot of knowledge from these objects,” he says.
 
 On the occasion of World Museum Day on May 18, Divekar’s museum will remain open for all on May 18,19 and 20 from 10.30am to 5pm. Entry is free.
