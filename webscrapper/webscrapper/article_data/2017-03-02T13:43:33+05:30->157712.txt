Bhubaneswar: The condition of a three-month-old   turned critical on Tuesday after her parents branded her with a hot iron in order to cure stomach ailments. The incident took place at   village under   block in Angul district. She was later admitted to the Pallahara subdivisional hospital where she underwent treatment for burn injuries on her belly. 

 The girl's father,  , and mother Buduni had been worried about her stomach disorder for the past one week. Desperate for a quick solution, they heeded the advice of some villagers who asked them to brand the baby with a hot iron. "While the baby's health improved a little initially after the branding, she fell ill again later. We got scared and took her to a hospital immediately," said Ajay. Defending his act, he added tribals often brand infants with hot iron to them of different diseases.
 
 Subdivisional medical officer Dr Ranjita Biswal said, "The baby girl was brought to the hospital in a critical condition on Tuesday. She was suffering from pneumonia. But her parents were completely unaware of the disease and branded her with a hot iron instead thinking that would put an end to their child's problems." She added, "In the process, the baby sustained burn injuries at four places on her belly. Our doctors are attending to her and she is recovering fast. She is out of danger now." 
 
 Branding is an age-old practice of tribals in Koraput, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri and some other places of the state. So steeped are tribals in their belief that this has claimed the lives of many chidren. Despite laws in place to prevent such practices, they continue unabated as was evident in this case.
