AMRITSAR: Defeat of BJP secretary Tarun Chugh from Amritsar Central assembly constituency has probably put his political career at stake while the unresolved issue of garbage dump at Bhagatanwala proved to be a boon for the success of Congress candidate from Amritsar South assembly constituency Inderbir Singh Bolaria.

 Despite opposition from local BJP leadership, Chugh managed to get party ticket due to his close relations with party president Amit Shah. Though Chugh remained active in his assembly constituency, he couldn’t become a popular leader, mainly due to opposition from his own party leaders.
 
 “We had already informed the party high command about Chugh’s meagre winning chances but we were ignored. Since we have been proved right, we can hope that the party would do a major revamping in the sate unit,” said a disgruntled BJP leader, who was also in race for getting party ticket from Amritsar Central, on condition of anonymity. During the 2012 assembly elections, Chugh had lost to Congress’s Om Prakash Soni by nearly 13,000 votes.
 
 On the other hand, the unresolved issue of garbage dump at Bhagatanwala proved to be a boon for Bolaria, who quit SAD and joined the Congress. In 2012, Bolaria had defeated Jasbir Singh Dimpa of the Congress by over 15,000 votes.
 
 Perceived to be their stronghold, Akalis had fielded their Amritsar district urban unit chief Gurpartap Singh Tikka while AAP had fielded Dr Inderbir Singh Nijjar from Amritsar South constituency.
 
 Going against the party’s stand on the dump, Bolaria chose to side with the people of his constituency and revolted against Akalis. “Political leaders who stand by the people whom they represent always win and we are happy for his victory,” said Nirmal Singh, member of the joint agitation committee set up for shifting of the dump from Bhagatanwala.
