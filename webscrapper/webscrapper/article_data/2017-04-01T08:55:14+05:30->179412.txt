ALLAHABAD: Congress Rajya Sabha MP   has demanded the extension of New-Delhi Kanpur Shatabdi Express till Allahabad. 

 He raised the issue before Union railway minister   at Rajya Sabha recently. Tiwari said that Shatabdi express, which runs between New Delhi and Kanpur, stays at Kanpur yard for over five hours. If the same train runs till Allahabad , many passengers will be benefited, added Tiwari. 
 
 Also, for the same reason, there would be no need to ply another super fast train on   route, which, as a result, would increase the revenue of railways. Tiwari also raised the issue of the work being carried out on Amethi- Atheha- Unchahar railway track at a snails pace, despite sanctioning of funds.
