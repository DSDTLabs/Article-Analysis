VARANASI: Taking a dig at the slow progress of development works during the Congress and   regimes at the Centre and the state, PM   said on Friday that he if he lays the foundation stone of a project, he makes sure that he inaugurates it at well.

 Modi launched 17 projects worth Rs 492.42 crore in Varanasi, his   constituency, and laid the foundation of six more projects worth Rs 451.67 crore. “I don't think projects of such a tune were either inaugurated or their foundation stones laid in the past several years,“ Modi said. “Works that were pending for the past 20-25 years have begun moving at a fast pace after gutsy decisions taken by the Centre and the UP government. Projects completed in time open the door for development,“ he added.
 
 The PM criticised the SP government, saying two overbridges across Ganga -Samne Ghat worth Rs 98 crore and   bridge worth Rs 92 crore -were conceptualised years ago, but work on them was expedited only six months ago when the Yogi government came to power.“Foundation stones were laid for vested political interests, but the projects never get completed,“ Modi said. Modi said every problem's solution vests in development. “The former governments had hatred towards development and for them the state coffers were meant to be wasted during elections,“ he said.
