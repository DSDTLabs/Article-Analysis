MUMBAI: A cash-starved   government hiked the value added tax on country and Indian Made Foreign Liquor by 2.85%, a move believed primarily to offset massive losses caused by the Supreme Court’s directive to close   and permit rooms on national highways. The excise department expects to garner Rs 600 crore following the hike in  .

 While presenting the budget proposals, finance minister   said value added tax on the maximum retail price of country and foreign liquor will be increased from 23.08% to 25.93%.
 
 Though Mungantiwar did not specify reasons for the hike in VAT, a senior bureaucrat told TOI that there was no option before the government to compensate for the losses caused by closure of shops on national highways following the directives of the apex court. “We expect to mobilise Rs 600 crore following the hike in value added tax,” he said.
 
 The bureaucrat said owing to demonetisation and the proposal to close to liquor shops on national highways, the state excise department has failed to achieve the target for the current financial year. “We had set a target of Rs 15,300 crore but by March 31, we will be able to mobilise only Rs 12,500 crore. During November and December 2016, the demand for liquor fell and   stocks too reduced owing to demonetisation,’’ he said.
 
 He said following the court ruling to close liquor shops on national highways, the state excise department will have to shut 15,600 shops out of 25,000 shops which will result in an annual loss of Rs 300 crore. In addition, it faces an annual loss of Rs 600 crore following complete prohibition in Chandrapur, the home town of Mungantiwar. “Besides the loss of Rs 300 crore due to closure of shops and Rs 600 crore following the liquor ban in Chandrapur, we fear we will further lose at least Rs 2,000 crore per year owing to non-recovery of excise duty due to illegal sale of liquor on national highways,” he said.
