NEW DELHI: Defence minister   stressed on Tuesday that the armed forces will continue with their tough stance against terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir, while stating that a tourist’s death in a stone-pelting incident was a blow to ongoing efforts to promote tourism in the strife-torn state.

 
 Describing the Kashmir issue as “very sensitive and nuanced”, while dismissing questions about the government’s tough policy in dealing with militancy leading to a jump in the number of local youth joining militant ranks, Sitharaman said, “You can’t hold the armed forces responsible for being firm with terrorists. We need to be firm with terrorists.”
 
 The minister said the death of R Thirumani, a 22-year-old resident of Chennai, in a stone-pelting incident near Narbal on Monday was “absolutely unfortunate” and “not very conducive” for tourism. “I don’t know whether it was inadvertent or committed knowingly but it is completely condemnable,” she added, in the backdrop of the increasing incidents of stonepelting by protesters in the Valley, which are often undertaken to disrupt active counter-insurgency operations by the security forces.
 
 “I am sure the chief minister (Mehbooba Mufti) herself is keen on getting more tourists to Kashmir because that will also help in restoring normalcy. So, if that has been a stated desire, for a stone-pelting incident to have hurt and killed a tourist, it’s certainly not very conducive to that,” said Sitharaman. The free and safe movement of tourists in the state needs to be ensured so that normalcy can be restored in the Valley, she added.
