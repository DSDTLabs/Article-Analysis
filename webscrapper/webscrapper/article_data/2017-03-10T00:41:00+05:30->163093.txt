Vasco: A decommissioned pipeline, containing black oil, on Thursday, began emitting thick smoke at MPT gate No 9, due to oil residue in the unused pipeline. The work of cutting the pipeline was under way when the incident took place at around 12.20pm. 

 MPT officials said that “the pipeline was laid years back by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). It was used to transport black oil from ships that anchored at the port. A couple of years ago, during augmentation of railway line, MPT shifted this pipeline elsewhere, and for last four years, this pipeline was not in use”.
 
 Due to expansion plans, MPT was in the process of removing the pipeline from its current location. On Thursday afternoon, while the gas cutting process was on, sources suspect that some residue oil in the pipeline was ignited, resulting in a thick smoke being emitted from the tail end of the one kilometre-long pipeline. Fire tenders were pressed into service and the situation was immediately brought under control. Neither was anyone injured, nor any loss was reported .
