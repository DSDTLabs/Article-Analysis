CHENNAI: The shutting down of a butcher shop and a nearby tailor shop on the same day helped police crack the murder of a man whose body had been chopped into several parts and dumped near a storm water drain in Nolambur last week.

 Police have arrested  , a 26-year-old butcher, for the murder of Babu, a 45-year-tailor.
 
 On September 26, when Chennai corporation staff Kannapan and Senthil Kumar were cleaning the storm water drain behind the fish market, they stumbled upon a sack. When they opened the sack, they were shocked to find the headless body of a man inside.
 
 A special team headed by Nolambur inspector   was formed to probe the case. On September 27, the team recovered a hand from the storm water drain.
 
 H M Jayaram, additional commissioner of police, North, said that the manner in which the body was cut made them suspect that the murderer was a butcher.
 
 "Subsequently we found that both the shops were closed from the day the body was recovered," he said. The suspect Mohammed Rasool of Pallavaram was managing a meat shop. He and Babu of Tiruverkadu, who worked in a nearby tailor shop, were friends. Both were missing since September 26. "Since the butcher angle matched with Rasool, we suspected the victim was Babu as we had received a missing complaint from his family," said Jayaram. Police nabbed Rasool from a hideout in Vyasarapadi.
 
 Interrogations revealed that Babu kept asking Rasool for money which often led to quarrels between the two. Following one such argument on September 25, Rasool attacked and killed him in a fit of rage.
 
 He later cut the body parts and packed them in five different sacks before dumping them in the drain. He had buried the head near one of the bushes, said a senior police officer.
 
 Police said Rasool was a previous offender who had been involved in series of robberies and chain snatching offences in Pallavaram and Tambaram.
