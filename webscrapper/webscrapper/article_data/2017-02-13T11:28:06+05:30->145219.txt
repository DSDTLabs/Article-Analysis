BHOPAL: The second person Bankura police is trying to connect is a native of Patna who has recently settled in Mumbai. He was earlier employed with ONGC Mehsana. "Udyan claims that Akansha and this man were in a relationship.   had called him 22 times on July 17, two days after he murdered Akansha, when he was in Delhi. We do not have more details now," said an officer. Police have his address and contact number, but have drawn a blank. 

 The third one is a woman from Arera Colony, whom Udyan claims to be a 'former girlfriend'. "He gets fidgety when asked about her or when showed his intimate pictures with her on his laptop or in his photo albums. All he says is that their mothers were colleagues and close friends," said a source. Police have not been able to trace her, either.
 
  has meanwhile confirmed that the passports of Udyan's parents are fake.
 
  "He had told   that his mother had settled in the US and couldn't come to India every month to collect pension of Rs 28,000. When bank demanded documents, he prepared a fake passport and even some fake US Embassy documents and produced them at the bank," said Hira, adding that his mother's fake death certificate was procured from Itarsi, some 90km from Bhopal, to sell off the Raipur house. tnn
