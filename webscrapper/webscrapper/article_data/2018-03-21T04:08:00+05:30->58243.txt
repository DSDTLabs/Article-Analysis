Vadodara: A used car dealer from Surat lost his Mercedes C class to a resident of Harni Road. The accused Sunil Parmar took the car from the complainant Pritesh Bangrawala and fled away after promising him to make the payment of Rs 39 lakh.

 Police said Parmar had approached Bangrawala around two months back to buy a used car. Recently, when a Mercedes C class came up for sale, Bangrawala called him. On March 17, after negotiations, the duo fixed the deal for the car at Rs 39 lakh. He took Bangrawala to a female notary in Chhani where the duo signed the sale deed. 
 
 The lady told them she would return the documents after notarizing them. Meanwhile, Parmar asked Bangrawala to reach MG Road near Mandvi where he will come with the cash. While Parmar took the car, he asked his friend Deepak Makwana to tag along with Bangrawala.
 
 They waited for Parmar till midnight, but when he did not return, Makwana told Bangrawala that he is going home and will return next day. Bangrawala, however, went to Parmar’s house but learnt that he did not live there. He later went to the notary’s house in Chhani, who told her that she had given the documents to another notary named Sanjay Panchal on New Sama Road, who had handed over the documents to Parmar in the evening.
 
 When Bangrawala realized that he had been cheated, he called his advocate from Surat and registered the complaint of cheating against Parmar and Makwana at Chhani police station.
