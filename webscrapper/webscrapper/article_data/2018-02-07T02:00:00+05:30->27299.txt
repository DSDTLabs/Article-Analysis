PATNA: With   falling on Wednesday, love birds have started planning how they will celebrate the Valentine’s week and what they will gift their partners.

 Although red roses and chocolates are in vogue every year, customized gift items are in demand this time.
 
 Chandan Agarwal, who owns a gift shop near Jahazi Kothi at Kadamkuan, said, “I have been selling gift items for 12 years. While soft toys and greeting cards were popular a few years ago, youngsters now buy personalized gifts items like key chains, photo frames, coffee mugs and even bedsheets.”
 
 Another gift shopowner Rahul Kumar admitted that coffee mugs with photos and personal messages were selling like hot cakes. Customers could be seen waiting for their turn to get photographs printed on mugs at Kumar’s Saidpur store.
 
 “Couple mugs are available for Rs 150 and above whereas customized key rings cost Rs 150 each. Bedsheets and photo frames can be bought by spending anywhere between Rs 3,000 to Rs 7,000,” Kumar, who has got 350 advance bookings for Valentine’s Day customized gifts, told TOI.
 
 Online stores are also offering huge discounts to lure customers in the Valentine’s week.
