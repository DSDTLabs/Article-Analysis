KOLKATA: Fed up with traffic violation notices? You can still bargain before paying the penalty as   will be held on Saturday, organized in all districts by district legal services authority (DLSA) under the aegis of   (NALSA). 

 Arijit Mukhopadhyay, secretary, DLSA South 24-Parganas said: "On Sunday, too, there will be Lok Adalat for traffic violation cases at Alipore district judge's court complex." 
 
 DLSA Kolkata disposed of 1.83 lakh traffic cases on a single day in September, 2016, and collected fines of Rs 64.4 lakh, said Uttam Bhattacharya, secretary, DLSA Kolkata. During Lok Adalat in June, 2016, they disposed of 1.04 lakh traffic cases and collected penalty of Rs 32.5 lakh. But Bhattacharya lamented as on November 12, due to   effect, 86,201 cases were dissolved with a collection of Rs 27.7 lakh.
 
 When traffic penalty remains unpaid for two months, the cases reach courts. "If traffic violation is in Park Street area, then the case is at Bankshall. If violation is in Jadavpur area it is at Alipore court. From traffic violation challans, one can know which DLSA to approach," Bhattacharya said. 
 
 He said people with traffic violation cases can walk in on Sunday at the Alternative Disputes   Centre. For other cases like motor accident claim cases (MACC), civil suits like partition, matrimonial cases, maintenance cases , dishonour of cheques and bank recovery cases including money suits will be heard on Saturday, if they have been referred by the court.
