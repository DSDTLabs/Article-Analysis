GORAKHPUR: Chief minister   said that there should be one voters list for civic, assembly and parliamentary elections in the state and it should be Aadhaar linked.

 Yogi was interacting with mediapersons after reaching   temple on Saturday evening to cast his vote in the bypoll on Sunday.
 
 
 Replying to a question on anomalies in voters list,   said, “The state government will send a proposal to Centre for having a single voters’ list for civic, assembly and general elections in UP. This list should be linked with Aadhaar to weed out all anomalies. An 11-member committee headed by health minister   has been constituted to prepare and submit a report in two months.”
 
 Talking to media, Yogi expressed full confidence on   winning both   and   seats.
 
 Yogi appealed people to contribute in strengthening democracy by exercising their right to vote on March
 
 11. “I appeal all people of Phulpur and Gorakhpur to rise above party lines and vote for development and good governance,” he said.
 
 Terming the election as a ‘mahaparva’ (mega festival), CM said, “In democracy, the vote of a common man and one sitting in power have equal importance. India is the largest democracy and we should all participate in the democratic process of election.”
