NEW DELHI: A Delhi Police   was robbed at gunpoint near south Delhi’s Nizamuddin area by two masked men on a motorcycle on Monday evening.

 The assailants intercepted the policeman on the pretext of asking him for directions and drove away with his gold chain and bracelet.
 
 Sub-inspector Manjeet  , who works with the wireless control team of Delhi Police, was on his way to Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib on his motorcycle when the two men stopped him asking for directions near Zakir Hussain flyover.
 
 They started following him on their bike and when they reached near Delhi Gold Club, one of them pointed a gun at Singh and forced him to pull over. The other accused then used a cutter to remove his gold kada.
 
 The two men then rode away on the wrong side of the road. Singh then informed Hazrat Nizamuddin police station about the incident.
 
  “A case has been registered for robbing at gunpoint. CCTV footage from the area is being scanned to ascertain the sequence of events and to identify the accused,” said a senior police officer.
