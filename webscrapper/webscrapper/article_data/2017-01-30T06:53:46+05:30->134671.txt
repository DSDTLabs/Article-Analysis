CHENNAI: The imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC had a telling effect on the atmosphere on the Marina beach. Visitors largely stayed away as policemen in large groups kept a close vigil along   from   to the  .

 Oddly for a Sunday, buses were not offloading tourists on the beach near the corporation-operated swimming pool. Few families were near the shore between the Gandhi and Kannagi statues.
 
 In the order imposing Section 144, Commissioner S George noted that the restriction was to “preserve peace and to curtail the nefarious designs of anti-so cials and anti-nationals“. He said recreational visits would be unaffected.
 
 But the order itself seemed to have dissuaded many from the beach, especially children and young sters. Only regulars visited the beach early on Sunday morning.  , who has been practising yoga on the beach for nearly 10 years, said he arrived a little early to avoid any hassle. “Our group assembled by 5.45am. We saw the cops arriving after 6pm. I had asked our group members to get on with our routine and in the event of any questioning by cops, we decided we would make their (the policemen's) task easy by leaving the spot silently,“ he said.
 
 The restriction also had an impact on vendors on the beach. The hawkers were almost completely missing from the beach.
 
 “We were asked by policemen from the D-5 station not to do any business. They told us that they would block people from entering the beach and so we would not get any business,“ said   who operates a chat shop from a pushcart near the lighthouse.
