VADODARA: It is a common sight anywhere in the city to see children accompanying their mothers working as maids to help with the chores. But a society on the   in the city has decided to put brakes on the trend.

 
 
 
 The residents of   on the road came together and took the decision when they observed that the use of children, particularly girls, by maids was becoming increasingly common. It was obvious that these children were skipping school or not going there at all to accompany their mothers to work.
 
 “Most of these children were girls. It was evident that   was being widely used in the society. We decided to come together and take a decision to ensure that this comes to an end,” said Renu Walia, a resident of the society.
 
 The committee managing affairs of the society took up the matter and took a collective decision. “We have strictly banned the use of children for work in the society. These children were largely from the nearby localities. We had been trying to restrict this since quite some time, but eventually took the decision,” said president of the society’s executive committee Daxesh Dave.
 
 Residents had also observed that in some cases, the girls going along their mothers for work started coming alone for work too. “It was not merely a case of helping their mothers. They ended up becoming maids at a young age when they should be in school. We will try to help such girls in whatever way we can,” said Reena Dhekane, another resident of the society.
 
 To ensure that all in the society know about the move, the decision banning child labour has even been written on the main gate of the society since last week. If the residents are to be believed, this has had a good effect and hardly any child is seen working in the society.
