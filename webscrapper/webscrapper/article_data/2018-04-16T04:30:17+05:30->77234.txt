MUMBAI: An e-ticket booking agent from Surat was arrested on Sunday for allegedly forging railway minister  's signature to confirm four sleeper-class e- tickets in the 'VIP' quota. The   (RPF) in Mumbai helped bust the racket and nab the accused,  . The alleged fraud came to light on Saturday when a railway official in   got the letter "signed by Goyal", seeking confirmation of four train tickets under tatkal scheme. "The language used in the letter was dubious,," said   inspector Rajiv Kharb. 

 Railway officials checked with Goyal's office which denied making any such request. Officials in Surat with help from RPF in Mumbai traced the phone number through which the tickets were booked and got the agent's IP address, leading them to Patel in Surat.
