You may not remember when you last relished a gourmet French meal, but you can certainly save the date for when you savour your next one -March 21.

 It's the day the French ministry of foreign affairs and international development will hold its third edition of the annual global culinary festival -`Gout de France' (or Good France) -at chosen restaurants worldwide. And Chennai and Puducherry are on that list.
 
 The fest, which aims to popularise and promote French cuisine throughout the world, will be held at more than 65 restaurants at various cities and towns in India. Nine restaurants in Puducherry ( ,  ,  ,  , Satsanga and La Villa) and three in Chennai (Prego, Six O One and The Square) have been selected as venues to promote the `Gastronomic meal of the French', which incidentally, features on Unesco's Intangible Heritage List.
 
 “On that day, 2,000 chefs across five continents will dish up a menu featuring gourmet French cuisine that includes aperitif and canapes, entrée, main courses, cheese platter, dessert and French wines and champagnes. That's what makes this an exceptional culinary event,“ says the Good France team in a statement. This initiative launched by the ministry under the aegis of celebrated chef Alain Ducasse, who has selected restaurants across the country in such a way as to ensure maximum participation of culinary lovers.“Diners can pick their preferred ambience as they will be spoiled for choice: bistro, coffee bar, contemporary or haute cuisine restaurants,“ says a statement from the organisers.
 
 The team has posted the list of restaurants participating in the festival on the official Good France website with details on eateries, menus, and chefs.
