HYDERABAD: Allocation of Rs 1,900 crore by the government towards fee reimbursement drew sharp criticism from all quarters as they felt the money allocated is meagre to clear dues. 

 "Even after protests, the government allocated only Rs 1,939 crore towards fee reimbursement dues. Till date, they have to clear about Rs 3,000 crore. If we add the fee of 2017-18, the amount would be more than Rs 4,500 crore," said N Goutham Rao, president of Telangana Private Engineering and Professional Colleges Managements Association. 
 
 Dr K Ramadas, president of Telangana Pharmacy Colleges, said, "If the money is meant to clear only dues of 2016-17, then it's fine or else it is just another move to destroy private colleges offering higher education."
 
 In total, including for 2017-18, the Telangana government owes Rs 4,800 crore to colleges, of which only 1,658 crore has been released till date. In October last year, private college managements had launched protests against delay in giving dues which led to supplementary exams for various degree courses being postponed.
