CUTS International had made a representation to all the Rajya Sabha members in Delhi, ahead of the winter session pressing to pass the bill.
 
 George Cheriyan, director, CUTS International, highlighted that while India has only 2% of the global motor vehicle population, it accounts for more than 10% of road accidents in the world. “Every hour 57 accidents occur on Indian roads and 17 people lose their lives. As for Ahmedabad, over 65% of two-wheeler riders and 55% of car drivers have been found to be using mobile phones, texting and listening to music while driving,” he said.

 “Comprehensive road safety policies on key behavioural risk factors and their implementation can significantly improve road safety in India.
