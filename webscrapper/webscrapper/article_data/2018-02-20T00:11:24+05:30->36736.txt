Vijayawada: The ruling allies,   and BJP, have locked horns again on Monday over the injustice meted out to the state.   leader and minister in the state cabinet, P Manikyala Rao said that it was just a matter of two minutes for him to send his resignation using the real time governance. 

 The minister added that they are trying to bring finance minister Arun Jaitley to the state to explain what benefits have been given to the state in the last four years. However, he said that breaking the alliance is no threat to the central government. 
 
 “We have seen Akali Dal from Punjab, Shiva Sena from Maharastra and Biju Janata Dal from Odisha breaking the alliance. But, nothing had happened to the central government. Even if the TDP breaks the alliance, the central government is not going to fall,” the minister asserted.
 
 TDP legislator Vangalapudi Anitha replied to the BJP’s threats of breaking the alliance. She said that the TDP was not worried or not going to lose anything if the BJP quits the Cabinet. “Let them quit the Cabinet now and win at least one seat in the next elections,” she dared the BJP.
 
 In another press conference, minister C Adinarayana Reddy said that it has no meaning to continue alliance with the BJP when things are not done. “We have been waiting patiently for the past four years for the BJP to do justice to the state. If the BJP is not willing to do and not delivering, where is the reason to continue alliance,” he shot back, hinting at early break-up of the alliance.
 
 As the political heat is on the rise with every passing day, it is to be seen whether the allies severe   even before the Parliament meets on March 5 for budget session, or would continue the alliance till the end of the session.
