PUNE:  , including high-speed ones, better safety features, modernized railway stations and extension of platforms are some of the items on the budget wish list of the passengers and railway activists in the Pune division.

 “We hope the Pune division gets some new trains. Also, we are hoping the division is turned into a zone in itself,” said  , the president of the  , on the eve of the Union Budget.
 
 Though she believes the railways’ shift towards privatisation is a “bad idea,” Shah does feel the Pune station must be developed like the one in Mumbai. “The station is in need of an immediate facelift. Trains with more than 20 coaches cannot be accommodated on all the platforms. Hopefully, there will be a mention of the station’s redevelopment plan in the budget,” she said and added that Pune must also get some high-speed trains.
 
 Since the railway ministry, in the recent past, had stressed on safety and security of train users, passengers expect to see some significant moves in that direction as well.
 
 “The area near Lonavla, also called the shat section, may not come under the Pune division, but trains to and from Pune have been facing risks along this stretch due to landslides. In the winters and monsoons, the conditions become worse. The railways had said that a GPS-based navigation system will be set up in the trains to deal with poor visibility caused by fog. We expect all the trains moving to and from Pune to have that system. Also, many places have a problem with trespassing. This issue should be dealt with seriousness,” said  , a frequent train user.
 
 Cleanliness is also a big issue among train travellers. “Though things have improved in the trains and at stations, much more needs to be done. Barring platform number 1, other platforms at the Pune station are not very clean. The same can be said about many north-bound trains. Moreover, the suburban network of the Pune division needs to be better developed,” said Rajeev Sharma, a passenger.
