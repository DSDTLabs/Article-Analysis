The   finalists from Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bengaluru and Kolkata, came together in the city on Sunday to test their number-crunching skills. Two hours and four gruelling rounds later,   (42),   (17), Kishore Kumar Sridharan (28) and   (19) were declared as the winners. The four will represent India at the  , which will be held in the third week of October, in Bengaluru.

 The representatives comprise two experienced and two non-experienced contestants. So, while Pranav and Kishore have previously represented India, it is a first for both Harmeet and Hemant. A student of economics at St Xavier’s College, Kolkata, Hemant says, “The competition took place for the first time in our city and I am extremely excited to make it to the finals. Even though it’s my first time here, I have been a part of several similar competitions in the past.” Kishore, a deputy manager in a power generation company, has qualified for the third time in the team. He says, “My wife is extremely excited for me. While I am unable to practice regularly due to work, I am a part of a group where we participate in online competitions and stay in touch regularly.”
 
 17-year-old Pranav, a student of IIT-Madras, says, “I don’t have to juggle my studies with the game — it’s like a stressbuster for me. I practise the number game daily for two hours.” Harmeet, a software engineer, who has made it to the finale for the first time, says, “Su-doku is more of a hobby and I’m quite excited that I made it to the finals. I practice whenever I get some time off from work by participating in such tournaments. For anyone wanting to take part in the game, I would suggest that they don’t look at it only as a mindbender but dive deeper into it.”
