TRICHY: The news that Tamil films would start releasing from Friday was met with positive response as summer vacation has already begun in many schools in the city.

 The   (TFPC) on Wednesday officially announced the calling-off of the 48-day strike against high rates charged by   (DSPs) over Virtual Print Fee (VPF). Over the course of the strike, only Hindi, English and old Tamil films were screened.
 
 In a Tier II city like  , going to theatres and restaurants are the only hobbies for city residents, said an MBA student  . “Only during the strike, I realised that we had no other alternative in terms of recreation. So I am happy that the strike is called off,” he said. 
 
 Industry insiders said that the turnout will not be exceptional on Friday and that it would only increase gradually. They said that the box office status in Trichy could only be determined only after April 27. “Promotions are very crucial for any film to have a good turnout. Since no movie promotions were carried out over the past few days, we can’t expect an immediate surge in theatres,” said joint secretary of Tamil Nadu Theatres Owners Association S Srither. Only one Tamil film, Mercury, would be releasing in theatres on Friday and a slew of films are expected to release in the forthcoming weeks. But the news that the ticket rates would be flexible from now on instead of a fixed-cap has created confusion among people. The Tamil film industry has come under heavy criticism for calling off the strike, when members from the fraternity called for boycotting IPL in solidarity with the on-going Cauvery issue.
