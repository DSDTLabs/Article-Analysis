MUMBAI: A study over 1,300 serious crime cases, from FIR to verdict in sessions court, in the city has found that only 23% of them ended in  . The biggest reason is the prosecution’s failure to prove guilt,   Foundation, which conducted the study, has found. 

 The study also found showed that it took an average of 11 months for police to file a chargesheet after lodging an FIR, when it should be done within three months. 
 
 The study took into account 4,900 cases reported from 2008 to 2012 in three sessions courts in Mumbai. Of these, 1,326 cases with final judgments as on August 2014 were studied for their life cycles. The study found an average of 26 months period from filing of an FIR to court’s verdict. This duration was 21 months for  .
 
 “Low conviction rates are a serious worry for the functioning of the criminal justice system. Out of 1,326 cases studied to map factors like time to trial, rate of acquittal and conviction, findings suggest that 911 cases were acquitted for inability to prove guilt and 33 due to witnesses turning hostile. Former state director general of police Sanjeev Dayal had issued an order in 2015 for separation of investigation in cases triable under sessions court from law and order duties. But this has still not been implemented," said Milind Mhaske, project director at Praja Foundation. 
 
 As of April 2017, there were only 38 working public prosecutors instead of the sanctioned 63 and 31 contractual public prosecutors instead of the sanctioned 40.
