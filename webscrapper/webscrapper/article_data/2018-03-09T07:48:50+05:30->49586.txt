THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state will do away with the infamous practice of headload workers demanding ‘nokkukooli’ from entrepreneurs from May 1. All trade unions have pledged their support to end this unethical practice followed by them for years in the state during a discussion convened by   on Thursday.

  is the practice of accepting wages for manual work in lieu of some work done by machinery hired by the entrepreneur.
 
 The CM has asked all district collectors to convene a meeting to ensure this in all districts before May 1.
 
 During the previous   regime, there were efforts to make Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam and Kozhikode districts free of nokkukooli. But, there are still complaints from these places. Vijayan asked all trade unions to stop supplying labourers to various industries in the state. The government will soon come out with a proposal to help labourers who are losing their jobs due to latest technology, he said.
 
 Though none of the industries have been affected due to the trade union activities in the state in the last decade, the impression about Kerala, outside the state, is the other way around, he added.
 
  (CITU), R Chandrashekar and Varakala Kahar (INTUC), K S Indushekaran Nair (AITUC), G Mahin Aboobaker (STU), G Sugunanan (HMS), G K Ajith and   (BMS) represented various trade unions in the meet.
