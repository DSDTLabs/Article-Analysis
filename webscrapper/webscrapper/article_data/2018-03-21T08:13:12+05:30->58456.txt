CHENNAI: A man posing as a doctor sent an e-mail on a forged letterhead claiming that hewas working at a corporate hospital in   and demanded money from a patient promising to get him treated for a kidney problem.

 Based on a complaint with the Nandambakkam police, a hunt has been launched for the conman.
 
 Police said a patient from Delhi appealed for help on a social networking site when  , claiming to be a practising physician at a private hospital, said he was ready to help the man undergo a kidney transplant if the amount was paid.
 
 He had sent him an email with a fake letterhead and an identity card. The patient who grew suspicious approached the hospital and checked if there was a doctor with the name.
 
 The hospital management replied in the negative. He also forwarded them the details of the email after which the hospital found it to be fake and lodged a police complaint.
 
 Nandambakkam police have sought the help of the cyber crime police to trace the man.
 
 Police sources said they would check the IP addressfrom which the email was sent to locate the suspect. “It could be a racket where they randomly sent emails to patients.In this case, it was good that the patient verified it with the hospital,” said an investigating officer.
