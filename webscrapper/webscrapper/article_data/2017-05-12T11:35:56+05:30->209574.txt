MUMBAI: The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators may be willing to sit down with members of the   across the table and once again go through the reforms in order to understand which ones can be implemented and which are 'impractical,' but that may not cut ice with the Justice RM   that put these reforms in place last year.

 While no members of the   Committee are willing to speak on this issue yet, a senior counsel, well-versed with the committee's functioning and who was at the forefront in bringing out the reforms, told TOI: "I don't think they can do that. I don't think they should do that either. The reforms have been decided by the  ."
 
 The CoA, on its part, admits that it is not going to look into any laundry list brought out by the members. "Definitely not the tenure and cooling off, that's not happening," says a CoA member. However, the CoA is certainly willing to look into the one-state, one-vote rule that was brought out in the   reforms. Interestingly, the state units of BCCI who stand to lose from the one-state, one-vote rule ­ Mumbai, Maharashtra and Vidarbha ­ voted against BCCI sending a notice to the International Cricket Council ( ).
 
 Yet, that will still not be agreeable to the Lodha Committee though the latter hasn't spoken on this issue yet. "I agree with CoA's stand on the ICC revenue bit. Not a single penny from that revenue goes to the players. But a committee that has been appointed to ensure implementation of reforms gets into everything else and now doesn't mind convincing the   about the 'impracticality of certain reforms,' that I don't agree with," the senior counsel said.
