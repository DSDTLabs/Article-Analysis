Expect an overdose of comedy in the upcoming film, Sangili Bungili Kadhava Thorae. Especially because it has a string of comedy actors playing pivotal roles in the movie. Directed by  , the movie sees   and Sri Divya playing the lead. 

 “I wanted to give Soori a makeover. So, we gave him an expensive, specially imported wig, which became a hit among the cast and crew. Even though it was somewhat tedious for him, Soori wore the wig throughout the shoot,” says the director. Motta Rajendran, too, will be seen in a different avatar in the movie, he adds, “Initially, I had a different role in mind for him, but later I swapped a few characters and the actors to make the script livelier.” 
 
 Ike had written Thambi Ramaiah’s character keeping his uncle,  , in mind. “His role has comedy but also bits of villainy. He had to carefully balance both these elements, but he pulled it off with ease,” says Ike. The director feels that Kovai Sarala is the right replacement for the late Aachi Manorama. “She has an amazing personality. She always had a lot of energy on the sets and has done some amazing work here,” he says. There is also Senthikumari, who, Ike says, plays a lady from down south with an irritating voice. The other comic characters include Ilavarasu, Mayilsamy and Devadarshini. 
 
 With so many comedy actors, Ike reveals he spent around six months just to get all the actors’ dates. But comedy should be part of the script and not be forced, he says. “I’ve learnt from Priyadarshan sir that comedy is part of the story and shouldn’t look forced. I made sure that the comic scenes are organic in the movie.”
