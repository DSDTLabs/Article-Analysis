 The 12.6km first section of Magenta Line between   in Noida and Kalkaji Mandir in south Delhi was inaugurated on December 25, 2017, by PM Narendra Modi. 
 
 Delhi Metro has decided to put up noise barriers along the corridor at select locations from where complaints of noise pollution was received. The barriers will come up on the viaduct mainly between Jamia Millia Islamia University and Jasola Vihar stations.
 
 “The Jamila Milia Islamia University and various Residential Welfare Associations of Jasola Vihar and Noida Sector 44 have been requesting Delhi Metro to take suitable measures to mitigate the noise coming due to train operations on the viaduct,” a DMRC spokesperson said. “The classrooms of Jamila Milia Islamia University are located on the both sides of the viaduct and similarly some of the residential colonies are also close.”
 
 The noise barriers to be installed along the viaduct would be about two metres in height and framed in the galvanised steel frames.
 
 DMRC is also planning to install solar noise barriers at the Magenta Line in the future, which would not only curb noise but also generate power. The solar noise barriers are planned to be installed between the Okhla Vihar and Jasola Vihar metro stations of the corridor.
