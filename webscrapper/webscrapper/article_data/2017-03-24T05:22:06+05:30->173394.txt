BHAGALPUR: Quite a few employees belonging to Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU) and its unit   (VSILS) at   are in for trouble with a Delhi police team visiting the varsity HQ at Bhagalpur on Thursday. 

 The policeâ€™s visit follows filing of a charge-sheet by the Delhi police against these employees for helping   and former Delhi law minister   get an LLB degree as a VSILS student. The degree has since been cancelled by the university.
 
 The Delhi police team discussed with TMBU officials the action taken by the university so far in connection with the fake degree row. It also sought a copy of the notification through which the degree was cancelled on Monday.
 
 A source in the Delhi police said the charge-sheeted TMBU employees included Aniruddh Prasad, Dinesh Srivastava, Niranjan Kumar, Prof Rajendra Singh, Rajiv Ranjan Poddar, Prof Razi Ahmed, Surendra Prasad Singh, B N Singh, Sadanand Rai Swadhu, Ramavatar Sharma, Shambhu Nath Singh, Bhudev Prasad Singh, H K Pandey and two VSILS employees --   and Janardan Prasad. 
 
 Tomar had claimed that he was a regular LLB student of VSILS from 1994 to 1998 and that he was issued a degree in 2012.
 
 In response to a petition in the Delhi high court, however, TMBU submitted the LLB degree was fake.
