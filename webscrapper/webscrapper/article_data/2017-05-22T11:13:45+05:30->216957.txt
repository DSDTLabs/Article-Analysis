MUMBAI: Beware if you are tourist here and someone approaches you with mobile phones at cheap rates. Chances are that you will get duped and end up with a fake  .

 JJ Marg police on Saturday arrested Siraj Ghachi alias Multani, a 26-year-old member of a   that operates in Masjid Bunder, Kalbadevi and  , particularly Crawford Market. Police arrested Ghachi under IPC sections for cheating and he has been remanded to police custody till May 24. But police are looking for his accomplices. 
 
 The gang moves around tourist spots, targets new faces by showing them genuine phones, saying they want to sell them at throwaway prices. They show their targets any   and quote a price of Rs5,000-10,000. Last week, Farha Shaikh, a student from Chembur, had gone shopping with his friend at Masjid Bunder. Two persons approached them, claiming they wanted to make a distress sale of the phone for Rs5,000.
 
 “Shaikh bargained and told the man to give it for Rs550. Within a few minutes, he agreed and Shaikh handed over the cash, took the packet containing the phone and moved ahead. On reaching Pydhonie, Shaikh decided to check the phone. But when he opened the packet, he found he had been cheated and there was a   phone inside,” a police officer said. Police said within the fraction of a second they would change the phone and victims would never realise it.
 
 Police laid a trap for Ghachi and held him at Null Bazaar.
