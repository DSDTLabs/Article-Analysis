PUNE: A young woman, in a bid to help a friend in need, lent him   worth   without her parents’ knowledge. Little did she know that the friend would squander the  . 

 The 18-year-old, who studies at a city college, informed her parents and subsequently lodged a complaint with the police. Twenty one-year-old  , a resident of Uttamnagar, was soon arrested and charged under   (cheating) and 406 (criminal breach of trust). 
 
 Sub inspector A M Pagare told TOI that the complainant and Gujale had known each other for several years, and were close friends. 
 
 In the month of March, Gujale told the complainant that he was planning to buy a high-end motorcycle. “Gujale asked her for help as he did not have the money required,” Pagare said.
 
 But when the complainant told him she didn’t have the money, Gujale suggested she lend him the ornaments. “He promised her that he would return the ornaments at the earliest,” Pagare said.
 
 The complainant accepted the suggestion in good faith. Without her parents knowing, she gave the ornaments to Gujale on March 10. “She waited for a month. The suspect gave evasive answers whenever she asked about her ornaments,” Pagare said.
 
 The complainant got suspicious when Gujale had yet to buy the motorcycle. Moreover, he started avoiding her. “On Thursday, she told her parents who brought her to the police station,” Pagare said.
 
 Pagare said that the suspect was arrested late on the Thursday night. 
 
 “Gujale had pawned the ornaments with a jeweller in Uttamnagar. We suspect he spent the money on merrymaking,” Pagare said. The probe is on.
