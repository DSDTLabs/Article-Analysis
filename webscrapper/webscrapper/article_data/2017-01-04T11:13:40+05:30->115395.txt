PUNE: The   (BNHS) along with Wetlands International is organizing Asian   (AWC) to count waterbirds all over India. While the census would be held from January 7 to 22, birdwatchers can count waterbirds anytime during the month.

 The BNHS in a statement on Tuesday said, “Waterbirds are the key indicators of the   and highlight their importance for both humans and birds. The AWC is a citizen science programme that supports the management and conservation of waterbirds and wetlands. It is a part of the International Waterbird Census (IWC) which is completing its 50 years of waterbird monitoring.”
 
 The AWC encourages people to count waterbirds in wetlands around them and collect information that would help promote the designation and management of internationally important sites such as nationally protected areas, Ramsar sites and Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs). The data collected through the AWC would also help identify and protect new sites of importance for waterbirds.
 
  A special Indian   will mark the 50th anniversary of the IWC this month. This will encourage the inclusion of   for the census.
