HYDERABAD: The   on Wednesday stayed the Telangana government's move to recruit only women for teaching and non teaching posts in girls' residential schools for SC, ST, BC and minority communities. 

 Following a petition filed by one K   and another from Nagaram of   district challenging the GO 1274 (all women GO) that was issued by the government, Justice M S   stayed the process. 
 
 Senior counsel S Satyam Reddy told the court that the state and the public service commission were going ahead without even amending the rules and reserve all the posts only for women. The existing rules do not permit such discrimination against eligible male candidates, he said. 
 
 There are as many as 500 such residential educational institutions in the state and the state is planning to fill all the teaching, ministerial and other posts with only women, he said. The judge stayed the implementation of the GO.
