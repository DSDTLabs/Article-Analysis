Vadodara: Large crowd gathered outside the IOCâ€™s Gujarat Refinery after a contract worker died a natural death on Wednesday.

 Police sources said that Mahendra Padhiyar, who lived at Sherkhi village near the city, had suffered a cardiac attack in the morning. Padhiyar, a contract killer, was rushed to refinery hospital and later shifted to a private hospital on Gorwa Road where he died.
 
 Sources in Gujarat Refinery said that the doctors at the private hospital confirmed cardiac arrest as the reason behind his death. On Wednesday evening, large number of people gathered outside the Bajwa gate of the refinery demanding compensation from the management. The crowd, which mostly included contract workers of the refinery, said that since Padhiyar suffered the attack when he was on duty, he should get high compensation. It was not known whether the refinery has announced compensation or not.
 
 Policemen were deployed in large numbers at the spot to control the situation.
