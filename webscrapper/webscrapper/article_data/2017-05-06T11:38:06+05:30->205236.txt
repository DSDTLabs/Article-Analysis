HYDERABAD: Stating that possibility of misuse cannot be a ground to challenge the statutory rules, the Hyderabad High Court has upheld the regulations issued by the   (AICTE) allowing engineering colleges to resort to voluntary disclosure of their   while seeking online approvals for their courses. 

 The division bench comprising Justice V Ramasubramanian and   was dismissing a petition by Federation of Social Responsibility Professional Institutions, Hyderabad, challenging the regulations 4.19 (a) and 4.26 of the AICTE ( ) Regulations, 2016. According to the petitioner, this self assessment is leading to several ineligible colleges getting approvals and therefore physical inspection by the council should be made mandatory.
 
  The petitioner contended that it is dangerous to grant extension of approvals based upon self-disclosures without undertaking physical verification. He expressed an apprehension that such a facility may be misused by unscrupulous private institutions. 
 
  The bench pointed out that "no statutory Regulations can be challenged merely on the ground that there is a possibility of misuse. There are so many legislations, which, by their very nature, are prone to misuse. But that cannot be a ground to test the vires of a statutory regulation." The rules should be either unconstitutional or contrary to the AICTE Act. The bench made it clear that if a Regulatory Body imposes a greater responsibility, accountability and obligation upon an institution, the same cannot be faulted by suspecting the credentials of all the educational institutions."
