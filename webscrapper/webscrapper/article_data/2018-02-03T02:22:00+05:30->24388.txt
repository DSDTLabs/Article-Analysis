This year the exam will be held on April 8 at three centres in the state – Vijayawada, Tirupati, and Vishakhapatnam.
 
 The exam can be taken in written and computer-based formats, but according to Bhawanarayana more than 80 per cent of the city students will be writing the tests this year. O Madhavi, a teacher at Guru’s Vidya Niketan, which gives training for IIT aspirants, said, “Students don’t want to take any chances when it comes to exams, especially one that is important in their lives. Many of them are tech savvy and most of them use computers for entertainment purpose, but when it comes to exams, they prefer written exams.”
 
 The training centres also train the students in a way that is suitable for written exam, she said, adding that the students are also habituated to take mock written tests at training centres. The question paper material will arrive at the selected bank in the city on the day before the exam, Bhawanarayana said, and added that the material will be collected on the day of the examination.
