GREATER NOIDA: The Foreigner Regional Registration Office ( ) has sought details of 112 students who left   in the past year either because they failed their their exams or owing to other reasons.

 As the details of such students have not been received from other universities too, the FRRO has asked the Bureau of   (BoI) under the ministry of home affairs (MHA) to confirm if these students have left the country.
 
 However, more such students are expected to come under the radar of the FRRO as the two other universities which have an intake of international students have not yet shared their data with the FRRO after a month of the figures being sought.
 
 “They have either left because of completion of course, failure in exams or other reasons,” Ajit Kumar, spokesperson for Sharda University, said.
 
 When contacted, officials at NIU and   did not respond to calls and emails from TOI.
