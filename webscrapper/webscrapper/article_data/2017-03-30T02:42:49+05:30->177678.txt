MUMBAI: The   on Wednesday directed that a petition filed by a  , Sunil  , who alleged   and sought an  , be converted into a PIL as it raised larger issues that require guidelines to be framed.

 A bench of Justices Ranjit More and Anuja Prabhudessai told the petitioner’s lawyer Pradeep Havnur that the allegations raise a larger concern. “These allegations are against the system and not against a particular policeman,” said the bench. Havnur agreed and said, “Yes, it is a larger issue.”
 
 The ACB said it had probed Toke’s allegations and found that no offence was made out for registration of corruption case. Government pleader Yogesh Yagnik on Wednesday informed the bench that it appeared that Toke was filing the petition out of “vengeance” as there was a report made against him before the police. Havnur rubbished this allegation.
 
 “Instead of making allegations and counter-allegations, there should be a solution,” said the bench. The court asked the government why heavy vehicles were plying on the right side of the highway? “Are traffic police in-charge on highways too?” asked the court. “There are allegations that traffic police take hafta. That’s why this is happening.” “It is an allegation,” said Yagnik. The bench said, “Yes, we are saying it is an allegation.” It is a general allegation and requires a treatment as a PIL, said the court. —Swati Deshpande
