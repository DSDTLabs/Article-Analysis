AHMEDABAD: The centralized post-graduate (PG)   form will cost Rs 2,000 and will be uniform for all   from this year, said officials of the committee headed by Commissioner of Health, Gujarat.

 The decision to introduce a common form was taken after common counselling for candidates was announced. It needs mention that admissions to the 1,687 postgraduate medical seats in the state will be centralized and based on the marks scored by candidates in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for Postgraduates-2017.
 
 According to the health commissioner  , students will be required to fill only one form of Rs 2,000. This form will be valid for 75% general seats and also for 25% management quota seats. Admissions to the general quota seats will be conducted by the admission committee headed by the health commissioner. Students will not be required to fill separate forms for management quota.
 
 Officials said that earlier students had to go to various colleges to fill up separate forms for management quota for which they were required to pay a form fee of Rs 8,000 to Rs 15,000.
 
 Under the new rules, common counselling for PG courses has been made mandatory. The Postgraduate Medical Education (Amendment) Regulation-2016 says that admissions to all postgraduate courses in all medical institutes will be conducted through common counselling. Sources said that, until now, deemed universities, private colleges and even universities had been conducting their own admissions for PG medical courses.
