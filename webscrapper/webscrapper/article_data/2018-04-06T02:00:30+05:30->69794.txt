NEW DELHI: AAP MLA   made some disparaging remarks on   Anil Baijal on Thursday at the ongoing budget session in the Delhi assembly. 

 Discussion on the outcome report of the LG office, which was presented by deputy CM Manish Sisodia in the House a day earlier, kept the assembly busy as MLA after MLA continued to blame the LG for creating hurdles for the AAP government. 
 
  
  
 
 “LG is protecting the corrupt officers of Delhi government,” alleged Bharadwaj and urged the party MLAs to reach out to the people over the “hurdles being created by the LG” in the work of the elected government.
 
 Bharadwaj alleged that the report card of the LG points out that he has “obstructed the work of development, education and health meant for the poor”. Bharadwaj said that the report card was not an appraisal of the LG by  , but it was the official report of the government that is based on official records. He pointed out different projects on health, religious pilgrimage, education, social welfare and others that were “obstructed”.
 
 Bharadwaj said that though it is not pointed out in the report card whether the LG passed or flunked the test, he believes the LG flunked it. 
 
 The elected government and AAP MLAs have been attacking the LG relentlessly since the budget session began. MLA Alka Lamba tried to justify this by saying, “We fight with the LG for the work of the people.”
 
 The day also saw a ruckus in the House when AAP MLA Kapil Mishra objected to a proposed discussion on alleged attempts to incite communal disturbances on the pretext of Ramnavami. Mishra was marshalled out of the House, which prompted BJP legislators to stage a walkout too. 
 
 The budget session was extended by two days for the third time since it was convened. The House will now meet on Friday and Monday.
