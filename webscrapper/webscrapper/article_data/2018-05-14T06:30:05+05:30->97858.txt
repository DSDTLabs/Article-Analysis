BENGALURU: The investigation into the multi-crore   has taken a curious turn with four of the five persons arrested in the case claiming they are “victims” and not accused.

 The four have pinned the blame on  ,   of Vikram Investments. In their bail petitions, the four — Narasimhamurthy, Prahlad, K C Nagaraj and Sutram Suresh — have maintained that they too invested in the firm and have lost their money. 
 
 The four, who worked as wealth managers and also roped in celebrity clients to invest in the firm, were arrested along with Srinath by Banashankari police in the first week of March following complaints of cheating to the tune of Rs 400 crore.
 
 The alleged scam came to light following a complaint from businessman P R Balaji, who was cheated to the tune of Rs 13 crore. A total of 17 FIRs have been filed against the five so far. A sessions court has already granted bail to second accused Narasimhamurthy in one case and fifth accused, former journalist Suresh, in nine cases registered at various police stations across the city. The case was handed over to the   (CID). 
 
 Police sources say around 400 petitions were received from those who claimed to have lost money they had investment in the firm. The investors include cricketer Rahul Dravid and badminton legend Prakash Padukone and their family members.
 
 The four wealth managers claimed before the court that investors made payments directly to the firm and not to them. Suresh has argued in the court that he too had invested Rs 13 crore till 2016-17, but the cops have mentioned him as an accused. Meanwhile, CID officials said they will file chargesheets soon.
