THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   (Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment) -- the   scheme to provide houses to 2 lakh   – will cover those living with HIV too. It is for the first time that they are being included as beneficiaries of a housing scheme and it is expected to go a long way in removing the social stigma towards them.

 The government had listed eight factors – mental disability, physical disability, people with serious afflictions and the like – to pick beneficiaries of the scheme and the initial survey puts the number of families with one or more factors at 37,295. Among these, 1,872 families include those living with HIV.
 
  Life mission CEO   said the mission covered four categories of people – those owning land but no home, those who couldn’t complete construction of houses or those with inhospitable houses, those who have temporary residences in coastal or plantation areas and landless and homeless people.
