Vadodara: Bodeli police booked two minor boys were booked for cheating by impersonation, forgery and criminal conspiracy after one of them were caught appearing in class X board exam as a dummy candidate on Monday. The boys were taken into custody by the police on Tuesday.

 The 16-year-old boy was caught from the Amratba Bhagat High School of Chalamali village in Pavi Jetpur taluka. Police said that the boy was identified by the block supervisor since he was a student of the same school. The supervisor then went to the principal and informed him about the boy. The student was writing the Gujarati paper.
 
 When the principal Amrut Bhoya checked his hall-ticket, the name was of another boy. The principal then asked him to return the answer sheet and made him sit in his office. After the exam was over, Bhoya took him to Bodeli police station and gave a complaint against both the boys. After registering the case, cops called the other boy too to the police station and questioned them.
 
 The other boy told the police that he had not prepared for the exam therefore he asked the other, who was one year senior to him, to take the exam on his behalf. Since both of them were good friends, the boy who was caught did not mind appearing in the exam as dummy candidate. The police have ruled out that any financial exchange had taken place between the duo.
 
 Both the boys were later sent to juvenile home.
