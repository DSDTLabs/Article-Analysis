BAREILLY:   chief  , addressing rallies in Rohilkhand region for the first time during the current campaign, said when she was the state’s CM, there was neither a law and order situation as there is now during SP’s rule, nor was there communal conflagrations. “No person with communal tendencies who tried to fan riots was spared by me. Even influential ones were booked and sent behind bars like   was in 2009 after his derogatory remarks,” she said, adding that no exodus would take place if her party came to power.

 The   and RSS were largely the targets in her speech. “The BJP exploited Dalits and minorities due to its casteist mindset. Baba Saheb (Ambedkar) made the provisions of reservation for Dalits in the Constitution but now, following the RSS’s agenda, the BJP wants to abandon it. Steadily all works are being shifted to the private sector. Similarly, BJP want to snatch the minority status from Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia University. They are interfering in Muslim personal law, challenging triple talaq and introducing uniform civil code. Our party completely opposes these things.”
 
 Mayawati didn’t forget to recall Rohith Vemula, assault on Dalits in Una, Gujarat, and BJP leader Daya Shankar Singh’s alleged derogatory remarks against her. “Ever since the BJP came to power at the Centre, minorities have been targeted in the name of cow protection, love jihad and nationalism,” she added.
 
 “When I was the CM nobody could dare to fan riots. I got Varun Gandhi (of the BJP) sent to jail for his derogatory remark during the 2009 general election. I didn’t consider from which family he hails and what his political affiliation is,” the BSP chief said, taking a dig at the BJP for not having a CM candidate because “they did not have credibility in UP”.
