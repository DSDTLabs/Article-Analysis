RAJKOT: The Rajkot civil court’s senior civil judge   on Wednesday issued summons to chief minister   asking him to remain present on April 19 in 20-year-old case in which he was the complainant. 

 According to sources, Rupani had lodged a complaint against five persons including Kashyap Shukla, son of late Jan Sangh leader Chiman Shukla, for rioting and alleged that they had pelted stones on his house in 1997. Court has summoned Rupani to record his statement in this case. 
 
 Shukla had switched sides from BJP to Shankersinh Vaghela’s Rashtriya Janta Party (RJP). However, after RJP merged into Congress, Shukla rejoined BJP. He is now BJP councillor in Rajkot Municipal Corporation.
