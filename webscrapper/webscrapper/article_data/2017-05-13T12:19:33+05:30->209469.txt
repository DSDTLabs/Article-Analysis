DUMKA:   (JVM-P) leader and Poraiyahat MLA  , who is currently lodged in  , is on a hunger strike and is observing silence to protest his arrest and the ongoing land acquisition process for the proposed power in Godda by   

 Yadav has reportedly informed about his decision to launch a hunger strike to his party colleagues in Godda and Dumka. He has also written to jail authorities, expressing fears of threats to his life from the ruling party and Adanis. The MLA was shifted from Godda to Dumka central jail on the behest of the Godda administration fearing emergence of law and order problem.
 
 "We had sought permission from the state government for shifting Yadav to Dumka central jail keeping in mind a possible law and order problem," Godda deputy commissioner (DC) Bhuwanesh Pratap Singh said. The DC, however, refused to comment on his hunger strike.
 
 The JVM-P leader was arrested on April 22 for allegedly inciting violence during a public meet in Godda on March 5. "I received a letter from the jail doctor who recommended physiotherapy of the MLA after the latter complained of back pain," Dilip Bhagat, Dumka civil surgeon (in-charge), said. 
 
 "In a letter, Yadav asked for mineral water and informed about his hunger strike and silence," a senior JVM-P functionary said, displaying the letter to the media on Thursday.
