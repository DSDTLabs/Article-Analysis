COIMBATORE: Burglars decamped with 67 sovereigns of gold ornaments, silver articles and wedding gifts from a locked house at   (Phase-III) at Vellalore.

 House owner   and wife, who returned from Chennai on Sunday morning, had found the front door forced open. “Their daughter’s marriage function was held 10 days ago. They had gifted her 67 sovereigns of gold ornaments. On Wednesday, the entire family had left for the son-in-law’s home in Chennai. After his daughter asked him to keep the ornaments in the house, Ravichandran had locked them in a bureau before leaving for Chennai,” a police officer said.
 
 Neighbours had informed the family about the theft, Ravichandran’s son Prabhu said. “We were returning to Coimbatore by train and reached here on Sunday morning. We got phone calls from our neighbours, who told us that the main door of our house was open. We had kept 67 sovereigns of gold ornaments, silver articles and gift items received from our relatives and friends in the house. The burglars took away everything,” he told TOI.
 
 Podanur police rushed to the spot and conducted investigations. Fingerprint experts were also pressed into service.
 
 Assistant police commissioner Somasundaram said they have collected   footage from cameras at a local petrol pump. “We have formed three special teams to nab the miscreants,” he said.
