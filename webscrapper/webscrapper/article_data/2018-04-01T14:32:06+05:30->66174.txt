The collection, which was a perfect example of fashion meets high-fashion sportswear, saw models showcasing multi-coloured metallic skirts and coats teamed with sports bras, gym pants, tees and bomber jackets. Bright colours like orange, gold blue dominated the ramp for this show.

  
  
 Priyanka Kumari (ffb Colors Femina Miss India Intercontinental 2017) opened the show for Myriad Activewear by Sunishka in a bright metallic mini skirt and looked like a million bucks. Models, too, got exceedingly flirty on stage and were seen flexing their muscles and lifting dumbbells for the paparazzi. 
 
  
  
 The costumes were inspired by the different hues designer Sunishka Goenka got to see on various playgrounds and courts. Colour blocking was one of the key elements of her collection.
  
  
 It was the showstopper actress 
  
  who stole the audience's heart with her dance on stage. Dressed in red pants, a sexy black-and-white sports bra and a see through jacket, 
  looked every bit a stylish athlete.
