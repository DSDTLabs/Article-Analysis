LUCKNOW: A delegation led by NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Ayog   Dr   comprising a number of secretaries of various departments will be meeting chief minister   Adityanath on Wednesday. The delegation will make a presentation of the welfare schemes and the programmes of the Modi government at Centre and explain their execution in Uttar Pradesh and address issues between the Centre and state. The delegation will also take feedback from officials of the Yogi government to form a collective agenda.

 From the frequent visits of high-power delegations to Lucknow, including those led by Union ministers and secretaries, it is evident that the Modi government is giving all support to the government in state by controlling implementation of all welfare schemes and programmes. 
 
 After Panagariya, Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh and his team will reach Lucknow on Thursday while the Union urban development minister Venkaiyya Naidu has already conducted similar exercise with the chief minister and secretaries of the UP government.
