PUNE: The frequent police crackdowns on the illegal call centres in  , especially in Gurugram, has forced many bogus call centre operators to shift their bases out of the northern state. On Monday night, the cybercrime cell of the Pune police raided one such call centre that had started operations from a location in Koregaon Park. Three men operating the centre, accused of cheating more than 11,000 US citizens by issuing threats of punishment for tax evasion, were arrested.

 Sudhir Hiremath, the deputy commissioner of police (cyber and economics), said, “Many bogus call centres have wrapped up their Haryana operations and have moved to new cities. The one we raided in Koregaon Park — in Lane No. 6, off   main road — had also shifted to Pune from Haryana.”
 
  (29),   (30) and   (33) have been arrested. Laghani, a software engineer, used to work in a bogus call centre in Gurugram. He shifted to Pune in November and started this call centre. The cybercrime cell has identified four more suspects and a team has gone out of the state to raid other call centres that were working in coordination with the Pune unit.
 
 The US federal government’s   and Federal Trade Commission have lent their support to the investigation.
