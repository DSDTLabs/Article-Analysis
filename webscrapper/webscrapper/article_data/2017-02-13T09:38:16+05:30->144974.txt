NAGPUR: People admire Lord Krishna as a philosopher, an ideal friend, a mentor and even a politician. But are they aware that his life stories could be the solution to their problems? Such thoughts were portrayed in the play ‘Mayur Pankh’, organized by   at Deshpande Hall, on Saturday.

 In the play, it was shown that some archeology students discover an ancient temple of Lord Krishna on their way. There, they meet a wise person (Shashishekhar Sinha), whom they ask many question and he gives solutions by narrating stories on Lord Krishna’s life. ‘The wise guy’ discusses gender equality with them by giving an example of Satyabhama killing Narakasura. 
 
 He tells the students a story where furious with the inhabitants of Braj for listening to the little Krishna and worshipping   instead of him, Indra, the king of heaven, decides to punish them by sending terrible rain clouds to flood Vrindavan and how the lord lifts the entire hill to save their lives.
 
 Sachin Giri (as Krishna), along with Nupur Badge, Maithili Deshpande, Utkarsha Dhore, Aashu Khatri, Snehal Rande, Pranay Katve, Milind Dhotkar, Anshika Chawla and Vedangi Kothekar played their to perfection.
 
 Directed by Deepali Ghonge, the play was written by Dr Dipti Kushwah. Mangesh Basve did the stage design while Swati Bhalerao choreographed the dance sequences. Subodh Surjikar was the co-director of ‘Mayur Pankh’.
