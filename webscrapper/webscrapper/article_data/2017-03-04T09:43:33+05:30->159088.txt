Economists with a conventional view say that the revenue expenditure is the non-productive part of the total expenditure. In Kerala's case, the revenue expenditure has grown by 16% over the previous year's revised budget estimates, while the capital expenditure, the productive part of the expenditure that creates assets, had barely grown by 4% over the previous year.

 Kerala had been building its economy focusing not on developing industries or businesses, but on developing human capital by offering quality education and a good healthcare system. Hence, the state has ended up with a huge revenue expenditure burden.
 
 
 
 
 As a result of growing revenue expenditure, the revenue deficit has gone up by 15% and the fiscal deficit has gone up by nearly 10%, which means the state will be forced to borrow nearly 10% more money.
 
 “The abnormal growth of revenue expenditure is considered to be a negative aspect. The capital expenditure was supposed to happen in industries sector and infrastructure,“ said P M Mathew, director,  . There are others who believe that the state's revenue expenditures proved productive. “Spending on education and healthcare cannot be termed non-productive. If Malayalis are working across the globe, that was enabled by the better education they had received at home,“ commented  , director, Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation.
