After a   exposed how contractors are forced to pay for every project, Maharashtra finance minister   has said that the   will probe the corruption charges against the  .

 The contractors have given break-up of how the Rs 1,095 crore budget allocated by the BMC is shared across departments, not just of the civic body but also the local police. One contractor told Times Now: “Even if we want to work honestly, we can't. The standing committee takes 1.45% of the project cost.From the site engineer, assistant engineer, deputy engine er, sub-engineer, accounts department we must pay everyone.“ If these claims are anything to go by then each standing committee member earns Rs 19 crore. The slush money is then passed on to political parties. The enginee ring and accounts departments come next, with the latter withholding payments if the bribes are not paid. “Nearly 15-17% of the project cost is lost in paying bribes to various agencies,“ another contractor said.
 
 The relevant approvals and papers for the project are cleared only after the bribes are paid. The contractors claim that despite all clearances, RTO and police officials create hurdles for them, which can only be resolved by paying them bribes every Saturday to the tune of Rs 3,000-5,000. The approval papers are only cleared for anything between Rs 50,000 and Rs 1lakh.
 
 The policemen use coercive tactics like harassing or kidnapping the workers if the bribe is not paid. The contractors also confirmed what Mumbaikars have known for long that the roads department is the most corrupt in the civic body.
 
 The contractors also seemed to take a dig at the action taken by civic chief Ajoy Mehta, which led to the arrest of two contractors. The contractors were confident that none of them will be caught and admitted that if their company is blacklisted, then they formed a new firm.
