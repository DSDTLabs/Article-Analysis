NEW DELHI:  , a senior Uttar Pradesh police officer, was suspended today for "indiscipline". Earlier this week, Kumar alleged on Twitter that the new   administration is targeting cops from the Yadav community. 

 Kumar, a 2010-batch Indian Police Service officer attached with the Director General of Police's (DGP) office in Lucknow, said in the tweet that those police officers with the 'Yadav' surname were being targeted. 
 
  
  
 
 Kumar later tweeted that his comments had been misunderstood.
 
 
  
 
 The police officer's claims were mentioned in the Lok Sabha by the Congress party's Ranjeet Ranjan.
 
 "An IPS officer has said, a particular caste is being targeted. The way hatred is being spread against Yadavs, Muslims and Dalits in Uttar Pradesh, it is against our Constitution," said Ranjan, raising the issue in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.
 
 Home Minister Rajnath Singh, however, assured the member that there will be no discrimination on the basis of caste in the state.
 
 "It has been just two-three days since the government has been formed. There will be no discrimination on the basis of caste, creed or religion. That is what the chief minister (Adityanath) has said. There will be no discrimination," Rajnath said.
