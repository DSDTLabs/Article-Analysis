PUNE: A 13-year-old boy from  ,   Ramesh Rao, died apparently after falling from the moving  , near   railway station on Wednesday morning. 

 The accident took place when the boy was returning home from Hyderabad along with his maternal uncle. 
 
 Assistant sub-inspector of government railway police, Pune, B N Sable said the GRP control room received a call around 8.50am informing it that a boy was lying on the railway tracks and that he was severely injured. 
 
 “We rushed the boy to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead by the doctors,” Sable said.
 
 He said that it was very difficult to ascertain the identity of the boy. 
 
 “We found only a visiting card of a computer institute based in Mumbai on him. We then contacted the cellphone number mentioned on the card.”
 
 The police were told that there were about 50 branches of the institute in and around Mumbai. “We sent the photo of the boy through the messaging service,” Sable said.
 
 In the meantime, the boy’s relative had alerted the railway police in Mumbai. “When we sent his photo to the police there, his relative identified the boy.”
 
 Arjunkrishna had told his uncle that he was going to the toilet. 
 
 Prima facie it is being suspected that Arjunkrishna may have accidentally fallen from an open door of the compartment. 
 
 “We have registered a case of accidental death. The boy’s body was handed over to his parents after a post mortem,” said an officer from the GRP, Pune.
