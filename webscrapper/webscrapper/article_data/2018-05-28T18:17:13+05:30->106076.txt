In the latest episode of  , Rudra, Om and   are seen dancing with the babies. After the song ends, Rudra overhears two women talking about the difficulties of raising children. This scares him further. He goes back to the Oberoi mansion, where Bhavya is relieved to see him safe and sound. He then tells Bhavya that he knows she is pregnant but he doesn’t want a child. Bhavya tells him she has not conceived.

 Rudra tells her that all the symptoms showed she was suffering from in the morning indicated so. And even   told him the same. Dadi enters and tells Rudra she was joking. Rudra is upset on hearing this but is also happy to know that Bhavya isn’t pregnant. Shivaay too relaxes and tells everyone that even he got stressed. Gauri asks him why he was tensed. Shivaay tells her that Rudra is a kid and then declares that he doesn’t want a child as he, too, is not prepared for such a huge responsibility. This leaves   and Dadi shaken. 
 
 They begin to question Shivaay. Dadi tells Shivaay that a marriage prospers only when there is a kid in the family and someone who can carry the legacy forward. Anika, too, asks Shivaay the reason for his decision. Shivaay tries to explain to them but when they fail to understand, he shows them an elaborate presentation. He shows them how different stages of a person’s life - school, college, job, marriage, kids- are governed by societal pressure.
 
 He shows them how it is the society which pressurises people to do things even when they don’t want to. It is, hence, best that one should marry or have kids when they are prepared to, otherwise drop the idea. This doesn’t go down well with Anika and others.
