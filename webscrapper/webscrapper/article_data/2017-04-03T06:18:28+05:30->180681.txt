AHMEDABAD: The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)-Main for 2017 was held across the country on Sunday. In Gujarat more than 60,000 students took the exam held for admission in degree engineering courses. Apart from the mathematics question paper, which was lengthy and tricky, students did not find other papers very challenging.

 The JEE-Main consisted of 90 questions divided among physics, chemistry and mathematics equally. The online JEE Main-2017 will be held on April 8 and 9. The exam results are likely to be declared on April 27. Students, who clear the JEE-Main exam, will be eligible to appear in JEE-Advance in May.
 
 In Ahmedabad, around 12,700 students appeared in JEE-Main at 26 centres. There were centres for the examination in other districts such as Surat and Rajkot too. Students whose centre was   near   had a tough time though for a wholly different reason. The examinees were asked to produce their Aadhar cards. A parent later approached the   police and, with their intervention, the students were allowed to take the exam. By then students had lost 30 to 45 minutes of the examination, said a city-based professional whose son appeared in JEE-Main on Sunday. Many students complained that mathematics questions were tricky and time consuming. Due to this, many students could not finish the paper on time.
 
 From this year, students from the state can also appear in Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET) for admission in degree engineering courses but those who want to be admitted to prestigious engineering institutes such as   (IIT), Nirma Institute of Engineering and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Petroleum University (PDPU) will have to appear in JEE.
 
 This year the number of students taking the JEE fell by around 25,000 due to the alternative of GujCET.
