SABARIMALA: A pilgrim suffered minor injuries after he was attacked by a wild boar near the   temple here on Saturday. 

 The man,   of Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, was having tea when the boar gored both his legs. He was treated at the Sannidhanam hospital. Hospital authorities said there have been multiple instances of boar attack this season.
 
 "I have been working here for three years and this is the first time I'm am dressing up the wounds of a person attacked by a wild boar. Two days ago, another patient, who was also gored, sought treatment," nursing assistant   P said.
 
 On Tuesday, another wild boar had spread panic after it went on a rampage at Sannidhanam, biting at least 25 persons, including a police officer.
 
 Though the biting spree gave rise to suspicion that the animal might be rabid, hospital authorities said necessary treatment has been provided to those injured. "We checked the wounds and gave necessary shots. The doctors are available round-the-clock ," a hospital source said.
 
 Forest officials, however, could not identify the boar.
 
 Meanwhile, Thirukovindan said he didn't expect such an experience at Sabarimala. "Since it is a forest temple, the presence of animals is obvious. Authorities should initiate measures to keep pilgrims safe," he added.
