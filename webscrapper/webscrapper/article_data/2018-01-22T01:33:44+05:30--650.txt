MUMBAI: If frequent   and negligence against doctors haven’t been an indicator of strained doctor-patient ties, a new online   has found that nine out of 10 patients didn’t trust the healthcare machinery.

 Hospitals were the least trusted, followed by pharmaceutical and insurance companies, said the survey taken by over two lakh Indians. Medical clinics, doctors and diagnostic laboratories were other healthcare players whom people don’t trust as blindly as they did previously.
 
 Vile Parle general practitioner Dr Suhas Pingle, a former Maharashtra Medical Council (MMC) member, said Indians are by nature not trusting. “People don’t have faith in each other, let alone their doctors,’’ he said. Indians also don’t trust scientific evidence as much as their “neighbour’s experience’’. Dr Pingle said a patient was more likely to trust what his friend has to say about asthma management than what his doctor says.
 
 Interestingly, the survey by online preventive healthcare platform GOQ, claimed Indians trusted   advice from celebrities or public figures such as Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar and yoga guru Baba Ramdev.
 
 Vishal Gondal of GOQii said the survey results showed Indians were no longer silent or docile patients. “Instead, they are now well-informed consumers keen to participate in the care process and demanding dignity and transparency from healthcare providers,” he said.
 
 Dr Shivkumar Utture, who heads MMC, said communication problems are most often at the centre of patient’s complaints against doctors. “After analysing many complaints, it is obvious that if the doctor had spent more time explaining issues to patients, the complaint wouldn’t have arisen,’’ he said.
 
 People want certain aspects of western medicine. “They want their doctor to talk to them at length, but the truth is that doctors in the West see less than 15 patients a day and get paid handsomely for it,’’ he said. In India, each doctor has an OPD of hundreds of patients. “Some general practitioners in Mumbai still charge Rs100 or so from patients,’’ he added.
