AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court is likely to get five justices as the   collegium has recommended five names — one advocate and four judicial officers from lower courts — for their elevation to the post of HC justice.

 Advocate   and four sessions judges – A C Rao, V P Patel, V B Mayani and A P Thaker – from a list of 10 persons, were recommended for appointment as HC justices. Their names were recommended by the chief justice of the high court, in consultation with the next two seniormost justices in July 2017.
 
 In its decision taken on April 19 to finalize the names for HC justices, the SC collegium noted, “At present, there is no judge in the Supreme Court conversant with the affairs of the Gujarat high court to ascertain suitability of the above-mentioned recommendees.”
 
 The SC justices mentioned that judicial officers Rao, Patel and Mayani have crossed the age limit prescribed for judicial officers, but since they were well within the age limit of 58 and a half years on the date of occurrence of vacancies, their names can be considered.
 
 For three lawyers, B D Karia, Megha Jani and  , whose names were also recommended by the high court, the SC collegium was of the view that “consideration of their cases can wait”, and the proposal for their elevation has been deferred for the present.
 
 The SC rejected the HC’s proposal for the elevation of P B  , who retired as principal sessions judge at Ahmedabad’s city civil court, on the grounds that his name was rejected in 2010 as well. The present HC registrar general P R Patel’s name was also not considered because he has crossed the age limit and has retired from service.
 
 At present, the HC’s strength is 28, against the sanctioned strength of 52 justices. Earlier this month, lawyers took out a march and staged a protest against justices not being appointed to the high court.
