Pune: The property registration department’s move to stay open on   on Tuesday failed to ring in the expected revenue.

 On the contrary, the department recorded a   dip (with 5,921 documents) in the registrations on the day of Gudi Padwa in the   against the daily average of 7,400 for March, raking in just Rs 69.48 crore.
 
 The registration department was kept open on Tuesday considering it has been struggling to meet the target revenue collection of Rs 23,745 set for the current financial year. So far, the department has managed to rake in just 81% of the target amount.
 
 “It is for the first time that we kept the registration offices open in the state thinking that more people will register their properties on the auspicious occasion of the Gudi Padwa. Also, we expected people to register their documents since the new Ready Reckoner rates will be announced on April 1,” a senior official from the department said. 
 
 However since most government offices were shut on Tuesday, many people keen to register their properties failed to acquire the requisites. “We had told the builder that we will go for the registration on Gudi Padwa, but had to skip it as I did not have all the required documents,” Nilima Rege, a buyer, said.
 
 Sampath Rathi, a potential buyer, said he will register the documents in April since the RR rates are expected to remain the same. The same was shared by Preeti Rathi, who has all the papers in place, but is yet to arrange funds for the purchase.
 
 Rohit Gera, Credai vice-president, Pune Metro, said some developers made most of the auspicious occasion simply because of their reputation in the market. “The registrations depend on the builders’ track record and it remains the most important factor for customers,” he said.
