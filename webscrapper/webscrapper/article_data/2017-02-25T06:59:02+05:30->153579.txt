LUCKNOW: A ten-year-old girl was saved from losing her right hand with the efforts of plastic surgeons at King George’s Medical University. 

 The girl’s hand was chopped off in the   in her village on February 1. She was rushed to the   by her father Gurubaksha Singh. 
 
 “The girl’s father brought the severed palm along. Since it was brought to us well within time, we could operate upon her and stitch it to the arm,” said Dr Vijay Kumar who headed the team. 
 
 The process took over six hours. “Saving the limb was possible with the help of microsurgery. First the bone was connected followed by nerves and then the muscles,” explained Dr Kumar. 
 
 Movement in the operated hand returned two weeks after surgery and the girl was discharged on Friday. Function will be restored when the wound heals completely.
