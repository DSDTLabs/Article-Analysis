BENGALURU: Building the underground corridors of   hasn't been a smooth process, given Bengaluru's rocky terrain. NP Sharma, chief engineer,   (BMRC), on Wednesday shared one such experience pertaining to the construction of the underground Metro station near Central College, officially called Sir M Visvesvaraya Station.

 “As we started to dig up to 60-feet below, the rock structure was so tough that we had go in for controlled blasting a whopping 1,200 times. This is a huge figure as the total number of blasts triggered for the entire underground corridor itself was around 3,000. It took several months to build the Central College station. It was a challenge as the blasting could take place only during early morning hours and our men had to do circuiting and other preparations through the night,” he explained.
 
 Sharma said tunnelling and construction of stations at Vidhana Soudha, Chickpet and Majestic was no mean feat. “A politician, who is now a Union minister, once told us in a lighter vein that shaking of the ground during blasting was okay and asked us to be careful so that the work doesn't shake their seats in the corridors of power,” Sharma quipped.
 
 Rise in ridership likely
 
 Sharma said there are chances of ridership touching the 8 lakh mark (per day) once the phase 1 of Namma Metro is fully operational. It depends on how efficiently the BMTC feeder network is integrated with the Metro.
