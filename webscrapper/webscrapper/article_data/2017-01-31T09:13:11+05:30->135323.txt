AHMEDABAD:   on Monday sought state government’s reply in response to a public interest litigation ( ) complaining that 39,965   have not been paid since more than three months.

 Petitioner’s advocate   submitted in the PIL that non-payment of salary and allowances – Rs 204 per day - to home guards has left their families in deep trouble. He has urged the HC to direct the state authorities to immediately release the withheld amount to home guards.
 
 The state government submitted that these guards do not get salary.
 
 The bench headed by Justice   questioned advocate Koshti why none of the home guards has made this complaint on his own. The lawyer replied that the guards fear victimization on part of their superiors in case of voice being raised against the establishment. 
 
 The high court will hear the matter further on Wednesday.
