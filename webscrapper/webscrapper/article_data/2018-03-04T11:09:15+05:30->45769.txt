MYSURU: Acting on a tip-off, district   were able to nab a gang of three near a residential area in   who were found to be in possession of an illegal   that belonged to a convict at the Mysuru Central Prison. Cops had detained the trio recently, and formally filed an FIR on Friday. Police confiscated a country-made gun, and 12 live bullets from the trio, besides booking a case against a convict at the prison, who is serving a sentence for murder. The convict allegedly made a deal with the gang to get a country-made firearm. The convict was taken into police custody on Friday, and subsequently returned to the prison.

 Nanjangud inspector Gopalakrishna received a telephone call from an informant two weeks ago about a gang that was dealing firearms in secret for a long time near Dharmikanagar, off National Highway-766. Acting on the information he received, the inspector immediately formed a team to investigate the gang. The cops managed to surround the trio – Dhanraj Bola, Sadiq and Shensha – on the same day. Although the three tried to flee on seeing the cops, their efforts went in vain. 
 
 During interrogation, it came to light that a murder convict at   was behind the operation.
 
 Pasha allegedly was in debt to Dhanraj’s uncle, another inmate in the prison. He had entrusted a firearm, along with the bullets to Dhanraj on the condition that he could reclaim them once the debt was paid. Dhanraj, who collected the firearm at a spot close to Mission Hospital a month ago, hid the weapon with a secret place.
 
 It was when pasha asked Dhanraj to return his gun to two of his acquaintances – Sadiq and Shensha that cops raided and arrested the trio who gathered at Dharmikanagar. While sources claimed that the gun had been smuggled from Uttar Pradesh, police are yet to confirm it.
 
 Dhanraj, Saidq and Shensha have been booked under the provisions of the Arms Act.
