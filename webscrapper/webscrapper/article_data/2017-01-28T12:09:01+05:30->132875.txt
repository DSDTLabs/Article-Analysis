JAMSHEDPUR:   India and   (SEA) managing director (MD) TV Narendran hoped that the growth of the steel industry in the third quarter of 2016-17 would be profitable.

 Admitting that demonetisation did take a toll on the company’s business in November last year, the MD said he is expecting a better output during the first few months of 2017. “The period from January to June remains good for the industry in comparison to the previous quarters, and we are expecting improvement in sales in the third quarter,” Narendran said at a Republic Day function here on Thursday.
 
 The MD also said that close to 80 percent of the business of Tata Steel is cashless. “The company’s business is 100 percent cashless where dealers are involved but business between the dealer and the customer at ground level is largely cash driven.” 
 
 Speaking on the   plant, where Tata Steel has invested millions of crore to set up a 6MTPA unit, the MD said the company planned to enhance the production capacity to 8MTPA instead. 
 
 “Initially, we had planned to produce six million tonnes of steel in two phases from   but now we are planning to increase it to eight million tonnes,” the MD said. Though, he added, the matter related to the proposed hike in the production capacity will be put before the (Tata) Board for consideration in the next couple of months. 
 
 The MD also mentioned that although production at Jamshedpur plant has doubled to 10 million since 2005, however, the emission level has come down considerably. With respect to safety, Narendran said the company has invested heavily in the last one decade but it’s a continuing process and the enterprise will work more on this aspect.
