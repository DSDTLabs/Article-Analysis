VADODARA: After making   compulsory,   will now also make registration of all   spread across the  . 

 A proposal to get all the alumni associations registered under a single umbrella - Office of Alumni Affairs (OAA)- is being worked out by the university. 
 
 Although the alumni associations will function independently, they will have to get themselves registered with OAA. 
 
 Presently, there are a number of alumni associations formed by former students, including at department level, batch-wise, faculty-level alumni associations and university-level alumni associations. But the university authorities presently do not have any system to keep a tap on their activities and know many of their office-bearers. 
 
 “There are multiple alumni associations, many of them working independently. But we have no means to know their regular activities,” said a syndicate member, adding that the idea is to streamline all the activities related to alumni. 
 
 “Also, we want to avoid duplication of works carried out by different associations,” he said, adding that once all the associations get registered with OAA, they will act as more authentic platforms for alumni to network. 
 
 On Friday, the university’s syndicate body also cleared a proposal whereby all students will have to pay Rs1,000 as alumni registration charges. 
 
 These charges will be collected from the next convocation onwards. So far, the university used to collect Rs410 as convocation charges while students had the option to register themselves as alumni. 
 
 Of the Rs1,000 which will be collected as alumni registration charges, Rs600 will go to the department, Rs200 to the faculty in which the student is enrolled and Rs200 to the OAA for holding regular activities of the cell. 
 
 OAA had proposed to make alumni registration compulsory for all the students to create a database of all the alumni of the university.
