Mumbai: From e-governance to wooing reputed companies to bid for BMC projects and providing food at discounted rates, politicians made several poll promises at an   at Dadar on Friday.

 With   barely a month away, Church in the City, an umbrella body of civic and political cells of all the churches under the Archdiocese of Bombay, organized an interactive session where   asked representatives of parties how they plan to make Mumbai a world-class city. 
 
  MNS corporator Sandeep Deshpande said they want to get reputed firms to bid for BMC contracts. “Providing best services to citizens should be priority, hence it is important to get civil work done through good companies,” he said.
 
 “The Congress aims at setting up BMC bhojnalayas on civic-owned spaces where food will be provided at minimal rates like Rs 20 a meal,” said Congress leader Charan Singh Sapra. “Our manifesto will include setting up drinking water ATMs, a ‘road doctor’ in each ward —a sophiscated machine that fills potholes within 24 hours—and regularize hawkers by updating markets.” 
 
 The BJP took forward Narendra Modi’s ‘Cashless India’ motto and said that if elected, they will enforce e-governance. “We want citizens to get all details on civic issues over the phone and pay tax online,” said BJP spokesperson Balchandra Shirsat. Felix D’souza of Church in the City said it is important for citizens to vote on February 21 if they want a better Mumbai. —Richa Pinto
