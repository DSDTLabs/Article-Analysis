 The CM, who was in the district for two days from Saturday, had attended several functions in the city and   district. On Monday, he left for   to participate in a special puja to be performed on Tuesday morning.
 
 Talking to the media, he said the union water resources secretary, U P  , has submitted the draft Cauvery Management Scheme before the apex court on Monday.
 
 “The draft contains some suggestions and ideas. With that draft, we expect a verdict in favour of Tamil Nadu,” the CM said.
 
 He also said the late J Jayalalithaa had taken many steps in connection with the issue. “We hope that all her efforts bring good verdict through the apex court,” Palaniswami said and added that the verdict would benefit the entire Tamil Nadu farmers.
