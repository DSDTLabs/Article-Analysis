THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has decided not to intervene in the controversy over the 'kuthiyottam' ritual at   temple but has decided to extend its support for the smooth conduct of the same. 

 Devaswom minister   who visited the   here on Thursday in view of the Pongala festival on Friday, said that the age-old tradition of kuthiyottam will take place as the way it has been planned. This year, more number of children are taking part in the ritual.
 
 He said that the controversies can be discussed later and at present there is no need to intervene in the issue. "If there is any child rights violation then that point has to be debated. All these versions can be discussed at the appropriate time," said the minister.
 
 The minister was of the view that there had been several instances of such age-old traditions being withdrawn. Hence such versions on this can be discussed at a later stage, he added.
 
 The state commission for protection of child rights on Wednesday registered a case suo motu against the conduct of kuthiyottam. The case was registered on the basis of media reports of DGP (prisons) R   terming it as a crime against children in her blog post. However, the Attukal temple trust had come out with a version criticising the allegations made by Sreelekha terming it misleading and were made without realising the reality.
 
 Meanwhile, the BJP has come out against the controversy over the ritual. BJP leader   claimed that it was a calculated attempt to sabotage the age-old ritual at the temple. The children and their parents are voluntarily participating in the traditional ritual and there has been no complaint against this from them.
 
 If the child rights commission has found any violation in this, then the commission has the responsibility to take action against similar acts in different religions.
