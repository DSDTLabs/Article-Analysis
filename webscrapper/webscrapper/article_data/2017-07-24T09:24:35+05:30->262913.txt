SHIMLA:   on Sunday said, people of   and   should amicably manage the dispute  ,   channel. 

 Residents of Lippa and Jangi in Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh have locked horns on the issue of water distribution since long. Lippa residents were adamant of not allowing the water channel, meant for irrigational purpose to go through their land towards Jangi and the entire population of Jangi was deprived of this facility. 
 
 Virbhadra who was in Lippa on Sunday to lay the foundation stone of second stage (metalling) of Lippa-Asrang Link Road which would cost Rs 6.20 crore, said, “I want all the areas to be equally benefitted by equitable development. We should help each other and not only think of self interests.” He also directed the officials to properly channelize the Kashang channel so that water can reach every field.
 
 Virbhadra Singh said, he was happy that Rs 12-crore Kashang channel is now complete and water can easily be available for Rarang and nearby villages for irrigational purpose. He said, small channels should be made to take water to fields. However, if possible, people should adopt drip irrigation system, he added. He said, the government was providing subsidy for drip irrigation sprinklers as well.
 
 He said, any planning pertaining to development should be initiated from the field. The officers should visit villages and remote areas, discuss grievances with people and then prepare plans for development, he added. 
 
 The base of development should be developed from the ground level rather than preparing plans with huge costing while sitting in offices without visiting the field. “We need to follow inverted pyramid formula in case of development of rural and remote areas,” he said.
