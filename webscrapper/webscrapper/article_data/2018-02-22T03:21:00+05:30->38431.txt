Guntur: Traffic management system in the city will be completely revamped with focus on introduction of latest technology.

 Japan’s Mitsubishi Research Institute (MRI), which had already conducted a detailed study on the traffic management system in Amaravati, has come forward to extend its support to install the new system in Guntur city.
 
 The entire traffic management infrastructure will switch over to new system which is expected to help civic administration in handling the vehicular movement with ease.
 
 A team of senior officials, including Guntur Municipal Corporation (GMC) special officer and district collector Kona Sasidhar, Guntur Urban district SP Ch Vijaya Rao and GMC commissioner Ch Anuradha, visited several top-notch institutes in Japan as part of a study tour organised by the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA).
 
 The team keenly studied the changes that are required to be taken up in Guntur city to make it a global class city in traffic management. “We will ready a comprehensive action plan to adopt advanced technologies in the traffic management system to facilitate smooth movement of vehicles on the city roads,” said GMC commissioner Anuradha.
 
 Sources said the traffic signalling system will be synchronised with the latest technology so that the vehicle movement will not be affected at any junction. “The absence of such synchronisation is forcing the vehicles to stop at almost all traffic signals.,” said another senior official part of the delegation. The violators of traffic signals could also be traced with the help of sophisticated cameras to be installed at the signal junctions.
