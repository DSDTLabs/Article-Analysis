CHANDIGARH: The   and Haryana high court on Thursday dismissed a petition seeking directions to launch criminal proceedings against singer   over his ‘azaan' tweet. A division bench headed by Justice   has dismissed an appeal filed by Sonipat resident Aas   against a previous judgement on the issue.

 Seeking directions to launch prosecution proceedings against Nigam, Mohammad had argued that the singer's tweets had violated the Muslim community's fundamental right to manage religious affairs as enshrined in the constitution and had also hurt religious sentiments. The bench refused to entertain the appeal after finding no merits in it. Earlier on May 1, a single bench headed by   too had dismissed Mohammad's plea, observing that while ‘azaan' was undoubtedly an integral part of Islam, it did not necessarily had to be relayed through loudspeakers.
 
 Terming Aas Mohammad's petition as a ‘cheap' attempt to get publicity, the single bench had observed that a fair interpretation of words used by Nigam indicated that the word gundagardi in the tweet was not written in context of ‘azaan' but for the use of loudspeakers and amplifiers.
 
 The single judge had also observed that even if the contents of the complaint were seen in context of Section 295-A of the Indian Penal Code (hurting religious sentiments), the words used in the tweet were not meant to insult any religion or religious belief of any class of citizens and were apparently not deliberate or malicious. 
 
 On April 17, 2017, Sonu Nigam had tweeted, "I'm not a Muslim, and I have to be woken up by the Azaan in the morning. When will this forced religiousness end in India?" The tweet by the singer had created an uproar on social media and a fatwa was also issued against him.
