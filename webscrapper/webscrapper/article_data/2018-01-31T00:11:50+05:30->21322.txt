Nagpur: The State   for   (SBWL) meeting on Wednesday, which is to be held after a gap of 16 months, seems to have been called to mostly clear   and road widening projects by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Mumbai-Nagpur Super Expressway. The meeting will be chaired by CM  , the SBWL chairperson.

 As per the   of the 13th SBWL meeting, almost 60% of the projects to be cleared are for housing schemes of realtors falling in the vicinity of Sanjay Gandhi National Park ( ) in Borivli and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Thane.
 
 Activists are aworried lot as they feel that road-widening projects will hit wild animals if mitigation measures are not announced along with the development plans.
 
 As per Supreme Court orders, any proposal which falls within the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of wildlife parks and which requires environment clearance under the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, and such proposals which fall within 10 km from the boundary of the parks require approval of the SBWL followed by the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL).
 
 Sources said the chief wildlife warden has recommended most of the projects with a uniform condition of depositing Rs 1 crore for conservation and development of SGNP and Tungareshwar to the projects outside ESZ but within 10 km but 2% of the   cost for those projects falling inside the parks.
 
 Also, ‘Ghodazari’ in Nagbhid forest range in Bramhapuri is all set to be notified as a wildlife sanctuary. Another crucial issue that will come up for discussion is bamboo flowering expected around 2021, when all the bamboo plants will flower and die, disturbing the ecological balance. The SBWL is likely to give approval to the felling and removal of trees and bamboo from Tadoba.
