KOLKATA: In a   at a   on Thursday afternoon,   after  . The octogenarian, who was punched, scratched and smothered by the robbers, is in nursing home now. While police are yet to track the miscreants, they are not ruling out the possibility of involvement of land sharks.

 Latika Mitra was alone in the first floor of her Kabi Sukanta Sarani residence when the two robbers entered the house around 2.30pm. Her son Tuhin had gone to the post office. The maid servant had also gone out keeping the main door ajar. The robbers climbed the stairs to reach Latika's room where she was lying on the bed. “They started searching the drawers for money soon after entering the room. It seemed that they were well conversant with the details of our house. When they could not find much money, one of them started beating up my mother and asked where she has kept Rs 70,000,“ said Tuhin Mitra, a retired employee of the Indian Railways.
 
 According to Latika's version -narrated to her neighbours later -the rob bers took her bangles, earrings and Rs 3000 cash before leaving the room in 15 minutes. It took almost an hour for her to muster strength and walk a few steps towards the balcony to seek help. There were blood stains on her face. “She asked for help and my wife came rushing. She could not even stand and almost collapsed when my wife managed to grab her hands,“ recounted Basudev Sur, a neighbour who lives in the same building. While Latika has been staying on rent at the house for more than 70 years, the Surs are staying there for more than 90 years.
 
 Since Latika was in shock, Sur's wife tried to contact Tuhin. Since his mobile phone could not be reached, Sur decided to inform police. Latika was shifted to a local nursing home after police reached the spot. Tuhin reached home after police came. “What's surprising is the fact that they came to loot money but left around Rs 2,500 in the same drawer from where they took away Rs 4,500,“ Tuhin said.
