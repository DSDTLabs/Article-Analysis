SHILLONG: The   (NEC) has sanctioned construction of 615 km roads across seven states in the northeast under the   (NERSDS),   said here on Monday.

 The Kawnpui-Bairabi road in Mizoram, the Belonia-Amlighat-Sabroom road in Tripura, the upgrade of Longleng to Tuensang, the RCC bridge over Dhansiri in Udalguri district have been taken up, among others, an official notification said.
