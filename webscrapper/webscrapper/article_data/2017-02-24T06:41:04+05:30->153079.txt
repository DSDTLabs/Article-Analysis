BENGALURU: The government has directed bus conductors of state transport undertakings (STUs) to screen the luggage of passengers before allowing them to board. 

  The move comes in the backdrop of Tuesday's fire accident in which a woman passenger was burnt to death after the   ( ) bus in which she was travelling caught fire near Nelamangala. Though the cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, transport authorities suspect it to have been triggered by some combustible material carried by passengers. 
 
  Transport minister   said: "According to the passengers who managed to escape, a few bags in the bus contained pooja material such as oil, camphor and cotton. They could have triggered or intensified the fire. We will get a clear picture after getting the forensic report." 
 
  The minister said measures are being taken to prevent such incidents. "We have decided to procure fire extinguishers for all the 24,000 buses owned by the four state transport undertakings, including   (BMTC). Tenders will be called and the process will be completed in about four months. In the meantime, we have asked conductors to check passengers' luggage and look for inflammable products. They have been told to refuse the entry of such materials in the vehicle," he said. 
 
  The transport corporations have also been instructed not to block space near the emergency windows by installing seats.
