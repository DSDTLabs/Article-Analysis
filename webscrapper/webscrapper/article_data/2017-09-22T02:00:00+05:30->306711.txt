PATNA: Kolkata-based US Consulate General office’s consular officer Madelyn Mahon has underlined the importance of education as the door to success and opportunities in life. “English-speaking skill is of course the foundation for good education today,” she said. Madelyn was speaking at the graduation ceremony of English Access Micro scholarship programme at the School of Creative Learning at Danapur on Thursday. She also gave away certificates to 20-odd students of the school on successful completion of the two-year programme.  Programme coordinator Deepa Dutta said the School of Creative Learning started in December 2015 with financial assistance from the US Consulate General’s office in Kolkata. It aimed to impart English language skills to bright, economically disadvantaged children in the age group of 13 to 20 years. She said most of the students selected for the two-year programme were first-generation learners from the tribal areas of Bihar. “The school is committed to empowering such disadvantaged youths,” she said and added the students were also imparted cross-cultural skills and computer literacy.
