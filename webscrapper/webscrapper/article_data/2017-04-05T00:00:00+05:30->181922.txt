Women’s   is one of the top priorities of namma Bengaluru City Police, which is evident from the ‘True Men Respect Women’ campaign it has been running. As part of its continuing effort in this direction, city cops had, in recent times, launched an   app for women, albeit on a trial basis. The distress app, which was put out for download on all mobile platforms was initially unnamed and a contest was opened to the public to figure out a name. “We got nearly 2,500 entries with name suggestions for the SOS   and have now zeroed in on one that we thought was apt. The   SOS app will be called   and is set to be officially launched by the chief minister next week,” says  , Bengaluru City Commissioner of Police. The app, which was updated earlier this week with its new moniker, has already registered over 5,000 downloads.
Suraksha is a fully-integrated personal safety app. It turns your smartphone into a discreet personal safety device for use during emergency. A call of service to the police can be triggered by activating the SOS icon within the app.
