ALWAR: A 32-year-old woman in   was hacked to death in public by her husband’s uncle who was opposed to her working in a factory. Usha Devi, a mother of two, was on her way to work on Thursday morning when she was waylaid near Khatu Shyam Temple Road by Mam Raj (60) who killed her with a sword.

 “The accused took out a sword and hacked her to death. Usha begged for help but nobody intervened to rescue her,” said an investigating police official, adding that the woman died on the spot. The accused fled from the scene when a crowd gathered.
 
 According to   police station house officer (SHO) Surendra Malik, Mam Raj had asked the victim on many occasions to quit her job as it went against family values.
  
 
 “Mam Raj lived alone in a different house. He was opposed to the women of his family working outside. A few days ago, he had gone to the factory where Usha worked and asked her to quit the job,” Malik said.
 
 
 
 
 Police said Usha and her husband,  , worked hard to provide education to their two kids. “The family’s financial condition was bad. Hence, both Mukesh and Usha worked to give their children good education,” said their neighbour Gajendra Singh.
 
 According to Alwar police, her husband Mukesh supported his wife and asked his uncle not meddle in their affairs. “Last time, when Mam Raj created a ruckus at the factory, Mukesh came to the spot and forced his uncle to go away,” the official said. Before working at the factory, Usha used to work at a private school in Alwar. But she had to leave the job after Mam Raj began regularly visiting the place and harassing her. “Usha used to shun her uncle. But he continued to harp on about women working outside and compromising the honour of their family” the official said.
