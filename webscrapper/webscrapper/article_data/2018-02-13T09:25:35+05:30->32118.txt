SURAT:   will flag off the Run for   in the city on February 25. There will be no entry fee for the participants in the marathon, which is likely to witness many national and international runners in action. 

 Surat Nagrik Samiti had held the marathon in 2017 too. This time it seeks to propagate seven themes, including Swaccha Bharat; Beti Bachao Beti Padhao, Tapi Shuddhikaran and Digital India. Organizers said the marathon is only to create awareness about social causes. They plan to distribute about 1 lakh T-shirts to people when the marathon is flagged off from Lalbhai Contractor Stadium on   by the PM. 
 
 “There is a plan to increase the prize money to Rs 50 lakh. We expect over 8,000 runners to take part in full marathon of 41 km, half marathon of 21 km and 10 km run. At least 1 lakh people will take part in the 5 km fun run,” Harsh Sanghvi, who is one of the organizers, said. 
 
 The PM may hold a road show from the airport to Lalbhai Contractor Stadium.
