CHANDIGARH: Lieutenant   is first woman from this city to hold the coveted   during the   of   (OTA) in Chennai. The honour goes to the best all-round cadet of the batch.

 
 She is also the city’s first air NCC (National Cadet Corps) cadet to be selected for this prize in the military academy, says Chandigarh’s air NCC commanding officer wing commander M R Pandeya. “History has been created. We are proud that a 2016-batch air wing cadet from No. 1 Chandigarh Air Squadron was best of the academy’s 259 graduates, including 41 lady officers, who walked out with the rank of lieutenant on Saturday.”
 
 
 As air wing cadet, she represented the group headquarters of Chandigarh at the 2016 Republic Day Parade and marched down Rajpath in New Delhi. “She was second-best air wing girl cadet in the country then,” said Pandeya. “She has always worked hard and made her city proud.” Second-generation army officer lieutenant Preeti Choudhary is a graduate from the Sector-11 Government College for Girls. Her father, honorary captain Inder Singh, served in Army Medical Corps.
 
 
 “NCC taught me to work hard, remain myself, and enjoy,” says lieutenant Preeti Choudhary. “The more you worry about the result, the more nervous you get and the more mistakes you make. Those three years in the air wing gave me the confidence to apply for the NCC special entry and cleared the SSB (services selection board) interview in first attempt.”
 
 
 Winning the Sword of Honour, she say, is secondary to becoming a good officer. “You have to give a bit extra each day. Even when no one is looking, you take no shortcuts. If you train well and stay confident, honours will come your way.” A bigger prize for the young officer is to know that her NCC instructors and parents are proud of her. “Their happiness makes the victory complete.”
