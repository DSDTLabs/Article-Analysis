KOCHI: Adding to the growing strength of the   (ICG), vice admiral A R Karve, flag officer commanding-in-chief,  , commissioned CGS Ayush, the final vessel in the series of twenty fast patrol vessels (FPVs) designed and built by the   (CSL) early on Saturday. 

 “The 50-m-long ship having a maximum speed of 33 knots was delivered to the CG on December 30, 2016, almost three months ahead of contractual schedule,” said Madhu S Nair, chairman and managing director of CSL. 
 
 Additional DG K Natarajan, CG commander,  , said that the 20 ships are part of the CG’s plan to expand operations in the coastal region. By 2020, they expect to expand their capacity by 150 ships and 100 aircraft. 
 
 “Security threats at sea and from the sea have been accorded the top most priority, and this has changed the role of the ICG, especially after the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai,” said Karve. 
 
 He said that the economic growth in the last few decades has reinforced the importance of the Coast Guard. 
 
 “The contract to build 20 new vessels for the CG was awarded to CSL in 2010. It was the largest order won by CSL on a competitive tender and it came at a time when CSL was reeling under the pressure of the recession of 2008 and the contract was of great relief to CSL,” said Nair. 
 
 The ship will be under command of Commandant Asheesh Sharma and will be under operational control of the commander,   region (east), Chennai.
