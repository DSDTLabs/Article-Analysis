PONDA: Emerging with the largest number of winners in the Ponda Municipal Council (PMC) polls, ‘Rising Ponda’ panel, backed by Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP), has shortlisted the names of   Naik and Geetali Talaulikar for the post of   chairperson. The panel has also ruled out taking support from a Congress-backed candidate in order to get a simple majority.

 Naik, a councillor-elect from Varkhandem (ward 8) and Talaulikar, representing ward 15 that includes Shantinagar (part) and Sadar (part), have served as councillors and are experienced. While Naik was a councillor for the 2008-2013 term, Talaulikar has entered her second successive term as councillor. Her previous term was 2013-2018.
 
 Ketan Bhatikar, in charge of MGP’s Rising Ponda panel, said the finalised name will be declared in a day or two. Bhatikar, a physiotherapist-turned-MGP leader, has been instrumental in rekindling zeal among MGP activists who lost hope in party activities after the defeat of former Ponda MLA Lavoo Mamledar. Mamledar was placed third in the 2007 assembly elections.
 
 “The PMC chairperson will be from the Rising Ponda panel as it has emerged as the largest single group in the polls. The name will be finalized in consultation with party higher-ups,” said Bhatikar.
 
 Sources, meanwhile, say that as the Rising Ponda panel is one candidate short of forming a simple majority, interest has been shown by a candidate from the Congress-backed-Ponda Citizens Progressive Front of switching allegiances. Admitting to this, Bhatikar said that MGP leaders have, however, opposed the move.
