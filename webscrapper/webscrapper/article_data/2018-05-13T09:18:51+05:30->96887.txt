CHENNAI: The next time you are booked and fined for a   and fail to pay the required sum within  , you could see a posse of men or women in khaki knocking on your door armed with  . The   plan to introduce the system from Sunday evening.

 The cashless mode of paying up fines for traffic violations has become a hit with police data saying more than 50% of the offenders having completed the transaction online within 24 hours. “The feedback has been positive,” said a senior officer.
 
 Now, with a 48-hour deadline set to pay fines, the police expect more to comply. “We are going a little slow in booking cases as our personnel have to adopt the new system,” said and officer.
 
 A system to identify and track defaulters has been created. As soon as a field officer enters details of the violator, the data will feed into a computer at the control room and an e-challan will be spewed out in a few minutes. A police officer said, “The computer will prepare a list of defaulters, who failed to pay their fine amount within 48 hours that is two days.”
 
 The list will be generated every day and a deputy commissioner and an assistant commissioner in the traffic planning cell will keep tabs. The traffic planning cell will prepare summons to be served to all defaulters. Law and order personnel will be roped in to identify regular defaulters. “We are working in tandem with the transport department to bring in the default list along with their licensing data, so that more defaulters can be dealt with separately by suspending their licenses too for making frequent offences.”
