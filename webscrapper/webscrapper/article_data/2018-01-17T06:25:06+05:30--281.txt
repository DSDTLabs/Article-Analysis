BENGALURU: Several pubs, bars and restaurants have closed down their rooftop operations in the wake of a Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara   (BBMP) crackdown against such establishments operating without trade licences, the civic agency has claimed. These establishments had been asked to voluntarily suspend their rooftop operations within seven days, failing which the Palike would close them down.

 “We have issued notices to 135 establishments so far,” claimed MN Lokesh, chief health officer, BBMP. Most of the establishments that were issued notice are in east zone in areas such as   and MG Road.
 
 According to civic officials, no commercial activity or construction is allowed on rooftops. However, many pubs, bars and restaurants had obtained trade licences to operate from one or two floors of a building and later expanded their operations to rooftops. There were also establishments operating only out of rooftops, they added.
 
 Dr Siddappaji, east zone health officer, said that a majority of the violators had suspended their rooftop activities. “We had issued 64 notices, and 60%-70% of them have complied with the order,” he said.
 
 Two pub owners had approached the   high court, which directed the BBMP to hear representations from the affected establishments on January 16. However, east zone joint commissioner, Dr  , who was to chair the meeting was out of town on official work, officials said. The meeting has been postponed, they added.
 
 The fire and emergency services department had also issued notices to 70 establishments to comply with safety rules within 15 days. That deadline ended on Tuesday. Fire officials will now re-inspect 70 pubs, bars and restaurants located in high-rises. A report will be submitted after the inspection. Soumendu Mukherjee, IGP and additional director, fire and emergency services, told TOI that action will be initiated against establishments which have not complied with safety measures.
