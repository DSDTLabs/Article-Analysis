LUCKNOW:   Chaudhary’s entry to   was not without high drama. On Saturday, Mayawati had called a press conference at 11am to speak on a host of political issues ahead of  . After she stopped speaking, Mayawati flipped a piece of paper kept on her table and nodded at her close aide and Rajya Sabha MP Satish Chandra Mishra. 

 Mishra, who was sitting with other   functionaries nearby, stood up, pulled out a cellphone and made a call. Mishra’s son-in-law Paresh, who was sitting with a few journalists, hurriedly walked out of the hall. Paresh is also a BSP functionary. 
 
 Mayawati, meanwhile, was responding to a volley of questions from journalists. She had barely answered some questions when suddenly Chaudhary walked into the conference hall with a bouquet of flowers amid flashing cameras. Chaudhary went straight to Mayawati, greeted her and sat next to her. No political leader, including those from BSP, has ever sat with Mayawati even in political rallies, let alone press conferences. Mishra, too, walked up and sat on the other side of the BSP chief.
 
 After Chaudhary finished speaking, Mayawati took the microphone and declared him a party candidate from Phephna assembly constituency, replacing Abiram Singh, whose candidature was announced less than a fortnight ago. 
 
 Mayawati, Chaudhary and Mishra talked among themselves for a few minutes before they left.
