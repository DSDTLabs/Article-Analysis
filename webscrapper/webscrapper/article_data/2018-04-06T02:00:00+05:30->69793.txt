PATNA: The Supreme Court’s recent order that allegedly diluted the Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act seems to have united   politicians across partylines in the state.

 JD (U) MLA Shyam Rajak told this reporter our Parliament should pass a resolution overruling the apex court’s order. “The Act should be incorporated in the Constitution’s 9th Schedule so that no one can interfere in dalits’ rights. We will not let anyone to take away our rights, which were given at the time of the formation of the Constitution,” said the MLA of the state’s ruling coalition of which the BJP is also a partner.
 
 Rajak also called on governor Satya Pal Malik on the issue. “The governor assured me that he would take up the matter with the Centre and also raise the issue at the governors’ meet to be held in Chandigarh,” Rajak said.
 
 Opposition RJD MLA and former state minister Shiv Chandra Ram ridiculed the Centre’s claim that it would spread the ideologies of Baba Saheb Ambedkar to every village. “The Centre is in fact out to end reservation in promotions, jobs and school and college admissions,” he said and added despite measures to improve the socio-economic conditions of SC and ST classes, they continued to be at the receiving end of most crimes.
 
 While BJP’s Bagirathi Devi said reservation could not and would not be removed, Bhim Army’s state president Amar Azad said the BJP-led NDA government in Delhi was playing dirty politics. “The BJP leaders keep assuring us that they are with us. Why can’t it take the initiative to pass a resolution in Parliament against the SC order?” he asked.
