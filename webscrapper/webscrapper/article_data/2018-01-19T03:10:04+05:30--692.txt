NEW DELHI:   is   a   for admissions this year after a proposal for “online counselling” was made before its  . 

 Under the new system, DU plans to develop a software that will allow applicants to select 10 colleges on the basis of their cutoffs and other preferences. Based on this information, the software will direct them to colleges that they can apply to. The procedure will be conducted in several rounds and applicants will get multiple opportunities to choose colleges. 
 
 While announcing details of this year’s process, the admissions committee said that the university is trying to shorten the “prolonged process of admissions that is often caused by unrealistic cutoffs”. So, the committee has formed a sub-committee to “formulate a policy on online counselling”.
 
 A member of the admission committee said, “This system will give applicants an opportunity to select a list of colleges based on their merit. This list will also depend on the cutoffs of these colleges...After this, an applicant can choose to fill the form of the college that matches his selection”.
 
 The committee member added that the procedure, which has several rounds, will encourage applicants to select the maximum options available. “The software will save precious time of applicants....a lot of time is lost as students are unsure of their choices and have to run from one college to another,” the proposal on   suggested.
 
 However, some members of DU’s admissions committee said that this system was “not viable”. Poor internet penetration, lack of internet knowledge and DU’s poor infrastructure were some of the reasons, they said.
 
 IP University also follows a similar admission process. “The proposal is new and innovative, but it needs to be worked upon. We can work on it only after the committee formed for it gives us a concrete plan,” another member said.
