MEERUT:   physically-challenged man allegedly smothered his elderly mother to death on early Thursday morning over a property dispute, a shock which his 72-year-old father could not endure and died soon after in   of the district. According to police, Ramdhan, a father of five, tied his mother to a cot and smothered her after an argument over property.
 
 His mother, 70-year-old Sukhveeri, and father, Shaamu, wanted to give some part of their property to their daughter also, a plan which Ramdhan was opposed to.
  On Wednesday night, Ramdhan came to his parent’s house in   village and decided to stay back citing father’s poor health as a reason. The next morning, neighbours heard some commotion coming from the house, which ceased after some time.
  
 Then they saw Ramdhan locking the door from outside, which alarmed them. When the neighbours barged into the house, they found the elderly women lying dead on the cot. His father, Shaamu was also found dead nearby.
  
 “As the locals broke open the lock of the house, Ramdhan tried to run from the spot but was caught by the villagers and handed over to police. The FIR was filed by Ramdhan’s sister, Sarla,” said  , station officer of   police station.
  
 Singh said that Ramdhan has accepted the crime during interrogation and agreed to have done it because he wanted the entire property.
  
 “Ramdhan killed his mother in a very cruel manner. When we entered the house, her mother’s hands, legs and neck were tied to a cot. An FIR has been filed under section 302 (punishment for murder) of IPC against Ramdhan and he has been arrested.”
  
 Ramdhan, who has disability in his left hand and left leg, lived with his wife and five children in a separate house close to his parent’s home.
