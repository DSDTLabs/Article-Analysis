NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Monday pulled up a central forensic lab for delay in preparing a report on the examination of mobile phones of nine students who are suspects in the case of disappearance of JNU student  . 

  A bench of justices S Muralidhar and IS Mehta made it clear that the director of   ( ), Chandigarh, will remain personally present in court on the next date if the lab fails to expedite the examination of seized electronic devices. Last month too, HC had asked the laboratory to give its report to the   by March 19 but the probe agency on Monday told the court that out of nine mobile phones, the laboratory has sent forensic analysis report of just three. 
 
 "The court expresses grave concern that a matter of considerable seriousness has not received the attention it deserved from CFSL. The mobile phones were sent to CFSL on November 14, 2017. Till date, the examination is nowhere complete," the bench observed, saying it is taking "a serious note of this laxity on the part of CFSL."
 
  HC directed that the examination of mobile phones be done by a senior officer and the report be made available to the CBI on or before April 30. 
 
  It was hearing a petition filed by Ahmed's mother Fatima Nafees seeking directions to the police to trace her son who went missing in October 2016. On its part, the CBI filed a status report before the court in a sealed cover and sought time to complete the probe. Senior advocate  , appearing for the mother, said the probe agency has not taken into custody the suspects who had threatened Ahmed a day before he disappeared and sought a court-monitored probe.
