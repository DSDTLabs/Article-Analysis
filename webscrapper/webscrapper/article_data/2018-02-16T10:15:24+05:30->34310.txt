BENGALURU: It’s the second time in two years that an under-construction building has collapsed in  ,  , which is experiencing a real estate boom.

 This building, on a crossroad, was to have shops on the first floor, while the second and third floors were to have one-bedroom and twobedroom houses, said workers. This could not be independently verified.
 
 
  
  
 
 “The building collapsed as its foundation was weak. The owner had built the first three floors, including the basement, four years ago, and took up work on the next two floors recently. I’ve asked the joint commissioner to submit a report,” BBMP mayor   said.
 
 Raj, however, said they don’t know of any violations, and has asked the joint commissioner to check if there were any structural issues or other violations.
 
 Neighbours said the building was unused and exposed to the elements before construction resumed five months ago.
 
 Bengaluru development minister   announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to the families of each of the dead.
 
 In October 2016, an under-construction five-storey building crashed, killing three persons and injuring at least eight.
 
 Two BBMP engineers were suspended pending an inquiry, with civic officials saying the construction was in violation of several norms. The sanctioned plan was for only ground plus two floors, but the structure was ground-plus-four floors.
