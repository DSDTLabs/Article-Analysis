MUMBAI: The transport department on Thursday announced the formation of a joint team of four junior   officials and eight   constables to pose as passengers and travel in autos and taxis to detect   rigging in the city. 

 The move comes after a passenger caught an auto driver with a hidden button to speed up the meter last week. A cheating FIR was lodged at the Meghwadi   station.
 
 “We conducted a series of checks after this incident and nearly 2,000 vehicles (autos and taxis) were checked over the past four days for meter fault and rigging,” a transport official said. “But we were unable to find a single case this way, and so we planned decoys to trap the unscrupulous drivers.”
 
 The decoys will board autos close to the highways, outside stations and near malls or cineplexes and check the meter on long-distance routes. 
 
 The RTO has also come across nearly 30 autorickshaws that had been scrapped but illegally continued to be on the roads for business, mostly in the western suburbs. The department suspects that some of these meters could be   and the vehicles have been sent for a road test. “If we find that the meters are rigged, we will prosecute the drivers and get FIRs registered at the police station,” the official said.
