MUMBAI: A day after a report by the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) showed that   Devendra Fadnavis has 22 cases registered against him—the highest amongst all 31 CMs in the country—the state government clarified that these cases were from the election affidavit filed during the 2014 assembly elections.

 “At present (in 2018), there is no case pending against the Maharashtra chief minister,” said a senior official from the CMO.
 
 The ADR report released on Monday analyzed all CMs on various parameters including wealth, criminal cases and education. The report said that Fadnavis had three “serious cases” against him. 
 
 The report also said that Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu has assets worth Rs 177 crore, while Tripura CM Manik Sarkar is the poorest with assets worth Rs 26 lakh.
