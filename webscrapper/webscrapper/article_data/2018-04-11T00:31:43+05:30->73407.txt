Panaji: Goa has told the   they are on track to host the 36th edition of the   later this year but made it clear that   would have to be moved elsewhere.
 
   , chairman of the Games Technical Conduct Committee (GTCC) for the National Games spent two days in Goa holding discussions with sports minister   and town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai, a part of the three-member Cabinet Advisory Committee (CAC) constituted to handle day-to-day affairs in the absence of chief minister  .
  
  The   also handed Goa a list of six disciplines they wanted to include. But while Goa had no hesitation in adding games like rugby, wushu, billiards & snooker and lawn ball, the state will not include equestrian and modern pentathlon, two more games that the IOA were keen on adding to the list of 32 disciplines.
  
  Moreover, it was also made clear that the states does not have the necessary infrastructure to host shooting.
  
  “Shooting will be part of the National Games but will not be held in Goa. We are looking at Delhi and Kerala as alternative venues,” said the sports minister.
  
  The Goa Olympic Association (GOA) has backed the sports minister in his decision to not invest crores of rupees in the sport.
  
  “We do not have the infrastructure. It’s a highly technical sport and it will not be possible for us to develop the infra within the prescribed time. Also, after usage is a concern. We would have to spend Rs 70 crore on the facility and it does not make sense (to spend so much) when the facility cannot be used either by the locals or police. The sport is not popular here and hardly have any following,” said GOA secretary Gurudutta Bhakta.
  
  There were also concerns about cycling with the state dragging its feet over the construction of a cycling velodrome. Those concerns, however, have been put to rest with land at Margao being identified for the ambitious project.
