Pudukkottai: Residents of a village in Pudukkottai district pooled in to arrange transportation, and also bear the operational cost, for schoolchildren studying at a panchayat school reach on time. With a total 99 children, the panchayat elementary school is located in Chidambaram Viduthi village under the Kothamangalam panchayat. 

 The government school is in no way inferior to a private school with facilities including a computer lab and library.
 
 All this was achieved with efforts by Chidambaram Viduthi villagers who generously contribute to develop infrastructure of the school. 
 
 “The school which started in 1973 witnessed fall in the number of students after the advent of private schools a few years back. It was then the villages came together to facelift the school. While it helped parents opt the panchayat school, apparently transport facility was the only thing that was missing,” said a teacher. 
 
 Saying that many of the children were facing issues in reaching school on time, S Suresh, a villager, said, “Many of the parents could not drop their children to school as both of them are working. In some cases, mothers could not come to school leaving household work. Considering the future of the children, we all came together to make transport arrangement for the children.”
 
 Beyond the parents-teachers association of the school and the village education committee, parents of children studying at the school and villagers have formed several committees to ensure proper functioning of the school.
 
 “This has helped the school to plan the needs of the school and the children and bring out solutions,” said a teacher, adding it has ensured smooth functioning while meeting all requirements. 
 
 A total of 19 children in the school were given bicycles for their all-round performance in the school as a mark of appreciation. While such events encourage children to perform better, villagers are supporting the growth of the school with their contribution.
