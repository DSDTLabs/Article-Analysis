PUNE: Finding  , especially in new places, has become a challenge for customers after brand advertisements were removed or covered outside the alcohol shops.

 A   store owner said many customers complained that they could not locate his store. “Some said they had to ask for directions from nearby vendors, which was embarrassing. Sales have dropped to an extent as new customers face problems in finding the store,” he said.
 
 TOI had reported earlier this month that the state excise department had directed all alcohol shops to remove advertisements of booze brands, flexes and neon signs among other such material from their entrance. The department now allows the names of liquor shops to be displayed only on boards at a size of 60x90cm.
 
 A liquor shop owner said, “The government wants higher revenue, but the latest diktat has made it tough for new customers to locate us. In some shops, even the branding inside has been taken off though the order did not specifically call for such a scenario. Once an order is issued, the official concerned applies own mind and acts as s/he deems fit.”
 
 Another store owner said alcohol shops were visible from far away earlier. “Now, even the name of the shop has to be fit into a small board, which is not enough,” he said.
 
 A tippler said, “A lot of people are unaccustomed to using   maps to find locations. Many use conventional methods to spot a store, especially in a new place.”
