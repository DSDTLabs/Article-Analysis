BENGALURU: The BJP leadership is leaving no stone unturned to make MODI (Making Of Developed India) fests a grand success across the state. But what is taking centrestage in political discussions is an  's token of love for Prime Minister  .

 A resident of Mangaluru and an ardent Modi fan, 44-year-old S Satish Prabhu will usher in the fourth year of Modi rule by slashing autorickshaw fare to Re 1 for four days from Friday. He has put up a poster on the rear of his vehicle (bearing registration number KA20 9388) announcing: “On the occasion of the fourth year of the Narendra Modi led BJP government, the autorickshaw fare has been reduced to Re 1 for up to 5km.“ Prabhu told TOI: “Modi has been doing a lot of good work across the country . I thought I should thank him for that and I chose to do that by slashing fares for commuters. The one-rupee ride will help commuters, especially the middle class, save some money .“
 
 In fact, Prabhu's plan was discussed in BJP circles after NamoBrigade member   posted the photograph of the autorickshaw on Twitter. 
 
 Though Prabhu maintains that he is not into hardcore politics, he admitted that this was not the first time that he was displaying his love for Modi.“When Modi became the PM, I had reduced the auto fare and more than 150 commuters had used the service,“ Prabhu said.
 
 BJP state general secretary C T Ravi told TOI: “Prabhu's gesture is a pointer to the fact that Modi's popularity seamlessly transcends all classes of people. The man on the streets endorses Modi's development plans and execution.“
