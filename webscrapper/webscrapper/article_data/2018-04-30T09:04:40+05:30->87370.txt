CHENNAI: A hawala-type method with a Rs 20 note and a promise of more money to be paid later, allegedly used by rebel   candidate T T V Dhinakaran in the   bypoll to bribe voters made headlines during the campaign last December. Though Dhinakaran had denied the allegation, it returned to haunt on him on Sunday, when he visited the constituency after several weeks.

 During the run up to the R K Nagar bypoll, in the wake of reports of both Dhinakaran and the AIADMK camps indulging in large scale bribing of voters, there was apprehension that the poll would be put off yet again. The Election Commission, however, went ahead with the poll in which Dhinakaran emerged victorious, defeating candidates of the ruling AIADMK and the opposition  , whose candidate lost his deposit too.
