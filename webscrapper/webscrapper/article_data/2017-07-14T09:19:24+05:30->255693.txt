BAREILLY: Even after organising a   to get   in Churai Dalpatpur and its nearby villages enrolled in the  , the teachers here could manage to get only 70% of the 1,500  . The teachers went on to visit the houses of these  , but to no avail as the children could not provide any supporting documents. Similarly, with July 31 being the last date to enrol all school students, only one lakh of the total of 3.50 lakh students in Bareilly have been successfully enrolled so far.
 
  “As the children could not provide their photographs, we were unable to enrol them for Aadhaar cards. Students are required to give documents for identity proof or at least a photograph. Teachers or village heads can fill up a form verifying their addresses but need a photograph to do so. However, we were unable to complete our target as the students are not turning up at the Aadhaar camps. When we go to their houses, we do not find their parents for counselling as they are busy in their fields. There has to be more such camps to get Aadhaar cards for every student. Also, the deadline must be extended,” said Arun Mishra, head teacher at a primary school in Churai Dalpatpur and Bareilly secretary of Uttar Pradeshiye Prathamik Shikshak Sangh.
  
  Basic education department only has a fortnight left to meet its deadline to enrol 3.50 lakh students in Bareilly in the Aadhaar scheme.
  
  Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) Chandana Ram Iqbal Yadav said, “For setting up Aadhaar camps, we need power supply. We have been organising camps in clusters. With some parents not cooperating with us, our teachers are spreading awareness among them about importance of having Aadhaar cards.”
