GUWAHATI: With the Naga People's Front (NPF), its ally of 15 years not changing its stance on severing ties, BJP is looking to strike an alliance with more than one party in Nagaland. With its new arrangement, it hopes to continue its association with old friends, many of whom are on their way out from   to join  , a party floated by former Congress members last year. 

 The two possible partners for BJP in Nagaland as of now are the National Democratic   ( ) and the Nagaland Congress. 
 
 "BJP has communicated to us that it wants to forge an alliance with us as well as the Nagaland Congress, where a number of NPF leaders are headed," a top NDPP leader said. On January 17, former NPF leader and   MP Neiphiu Rio had joined NDPP after months of speculation that he was the brains behind the formation of the party, seen as a contender to the NPF. Rio, long seen as BJP's supporter, has now been given the responsibility to seal the deal with the saffron party.
 
 "NPF has disintegrated," the NDPP leader said, referring to the series of dissensions that have rocked the party. After the intra-party conflict played itself out last year, rival factions of the NPF came together in December. The faction led by former chief minister Shurhozelie Liezietsu had, during the period of dissent, announced severance of the party's ties with BJP. After the reconciliation, several decisions taken during the conflict were reversed. The decision to snap ties with BJP, however, was not.
