Hyderabad: Seeking the setting up of a railway zone with headquarters in Visakhapatnam, a public interest litigation was filed in the Hyderabad High Court on Friday. 

 The plea says that the Centre has failed in its duty to set up a railway zone despite promising the same in the AP Reorganisation Act. 
 
 APâ€™s former minister Konathala Ramakrishna filed this plea stating that the Union railway ministry has failed to comply with the mandate contained in the thirteenth schedule of the Andhra Pradesh Reorganization Act.
