PANAJI: Four young   are undertaking a not-for-profit 7,000-km journey on their   across India, starting from Delhi, to raise awareness and garner support for child rights. 

 Partnering with Child Rights & You (CRY), the men in their twenties have already raised $19,000 through their crowd-funding campaign and will use the money to support the production of a documentary on child rights and donate the rest to CRY. The bikers are passing through Goa and will soon be resuming their ride to other states .
 
  Perry, Scott Grills, Ben Butcher and   from Sydney share a passion for adventure and envision a better world. With degrees in commerce, health science, photography, filmmaking and carpentry, these men are not new to volunteering and have spent their time educating and enriching the lives of those not as fortunate in   and India.
 
 The idea of ‘Ride for Rights’ stemmed from the passion to give back and do something for children, says Cameron, one of the motorcycle enthusiasts.
 
 “Partnering with CRY has given us an opportunity to visit and work with many of their programmes across the country. Our entire journey, including experiences with children, will be compiled into a documentary, the proceeds of which will be also donated to CRY,” says Petty, who has worked and volunteered with children and elderly living with chronic diseases and disabilities. He travelled to India in 2015 and desired to return to India after witnessing the living conditions of underprivileged children and their families. 
 
 While Scott had spent a year on the rural outskirts of Papua New Guinea working in a local school where he trained students in religion, mathematics and English, Ben is an freelance photographer and filmmaker who is drawn to rich and honest stories and has worked in Sydney’s child care programme.
 
 The ride, Petty says, is a way of bringing some hope to children, allowing them to dream and working towards realizing that dreams.
