SECUNDERABAD: The ongoing 'Save  ' campaign by walkers and sportsmen got a shot in the arm from the opposition   on Tuesday. 

 While walkers gathered at Parade Ground at around 6.30 am and were raising 'Save Parade Ground' and 'Don't Build  ' slogans, Congress senior leader V Hanumantha Rao walked in at the neighbouring Gymkhana Ground and interacted with cricket enthusiasts practising there. Government is trying to occupy lung space in the name of vasthu to build Secretariat. Congress would fight to protect these grounds for the benefit of hundreds of sport persons. 
 
 He said the Congress would fight against the state government's decision to build a new Secretariat complex on the Parade Ground land.
 
 "Hundreds of cricketers will lose their practice and no other ground in   except Gymkhana is available to them to play sports. Government should withdraw the proposal," said the Congress leader. He is the first Congress leader from the city to respond to the walkers' campaign against the Secretariat plan.
 
 About 200 morning walkers who gathered there released black balloons into the air as a mark of their protest against the government's proposal to build Secretariat on the Parade Ground land. 
 
 In a significant development, the Local Military Authority ( ) put up a signboard on Tuesday right in the middle of Parade Ground making clear some points for public to remember.
