KOLKATA: A preliminary probe into   De's accounts has left the Watgunge police foxed.Sleuths said so far, they have found details of two different accounts of Partho, including the one with a nationalized bank branch, which show that he had not more than Rs 6,000 left in each of these accounts.

 However, sources say they have a hunch that Partho, who spent a few years in the US, was putting his savings in an account that he had opened with a foreign bank. The Shakespeare Sarani police, in their probe earlier, had dug up several accounts to which Partho had access, though not all of them belonged to him. “Till Saturday, we have not been able to access all his bank details. We are waiting for further clarifications from different banks. Further search will be carried out at his Watgunge residence to recover relevant papers. This is our effort to ascertain why Partho, who was recovering well, will suddenly decide to end his life,“ claimed a source. Police said at this point they suspect nothing foul and aren't investigating anyone in particular. It was on February 9 that registrar   digitally signed the deed of conveyance that transferred the Watgunge flat to Partho's name, a mere 12 days before he was found dead. The flat had cost Partha exactly Rs1crore. The two-time payments were made through cheques of two different private banks.
 
 Till the time Partho was sent to Pavlov immediately after his father's death, cops had dug out nine accounts maintained by the De family , two each at IDBI, ICICI and Axis banks and one each at SBI, RBS and   banks.“Most of these had little balance at that time,“ said an officer.
