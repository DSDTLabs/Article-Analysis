AMARAVATI: The   (TDP) on Tuesday welcomed the conviction of Tamil Nadu leader   by the   in corruption case. Senior party leaders had a lengthy discussion on the SC verdict at the state coordination committee meeting held at party chief  's residence in Undavalli.

 Naidu is believed to have commented that it was a welcome sign that courts were not sparing leaders involved in corruption and illegal assets cases. “Imagine what could be the quantum of punishment in the '1 lakh crore embezzlement case if a fouryear imprisonment is handed out for amassing '64 crore,“ the CM said. He said corrupt leaders are a big nuisance for the nation and they need to be sent behind bars. He said that any leader, howsoever big or small, would face a similar punishment if the probing agencies have evidence of accumulating illegal wealth.
 
 He said that courts were handling such cases deftly and this augurs well for the nation. Referring to the recent agitations and protests planned by the YSRC, the chief minister expressed his anguish saying the opposition leaders are trying to tarnish the state's brand image which he was building brick by brick.
 
 Insiders said the ministers present at the meeting echoed the same and pointed out social media had gone viral about the likely punishment to be faced by Jagan and his associates in the disproportionate assets cases shortly. 
 
 Speaking to reporters after the meeting, party politburo member   said YSRC chief   should shun public life and said that the people were not ready to tolerate corrupt leaders. He said Tuesday's SC verdict would have a direct bearing on Jagan's fate.
 
 Reacting sharply, TDP MLA   said the YSRC chief must be facing a quake of sorts at his Lotus Pond residence already. “I foresee a 40-year jail term for Jagan for amassing huge assets,“ he added.
