LUCKNOW: With the unexpected   in all parts of the city and complaints pouring in about  ,   and cars being stranded on roadsides, Lucknow municipal commissioner has instructed the corporation and Jal Nigam engineers to stop all drain construction and sewerage connection work to households. He has also ordered for immediate restoration of roads that have recently been cut for water and sewer connections. 

 Of late, Jal Nigam had been cutting roads to lay sewer chambers and connect sewer lines with them. It was also giving sewerage and water supply connections to households and that also required extensive cutting of roads. 
 
 Since these have not been restored and are temporarily filled, they are forming puddles. Municipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh said, “We have been receiving many complaints about cars and cattle getting stuck in these muddy roads, disturbing the entire traffic on road. Hence, we have ordered to stop all construction immediately.”
 
  also mandates Jal Nigam to restore roads as soon as the infrastructure is laid but the latter hasn’t filled roads at many places after laying chambers, like in sector 8, Indiranagar, Vikasnagar and Triveninagar. Even people have cut roads to take household connections of sewerage and water pipes but have left the road either open or filled with loose earth. For example, in Mahanagar extension, the main road has been cut to take connections but left open, causing extreme waterlogging during rains. 
 
 The commissioner has ordered for immediate restoration of these patches. Even LMC engineers will have to stop all drainage construction in areas like Takrohi-Indiranagar, Dubagga and Lalbagh. However, the order also notifies that if some construction is urgent and can’t be avoided, it can be carried out after due permission from LMC authorities.
