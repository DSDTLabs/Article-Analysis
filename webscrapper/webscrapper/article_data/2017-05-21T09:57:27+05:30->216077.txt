AURANGABAD: Residents of the water-starved city may not have to bear the annual hike in   for the current financial year. Municipal commissioner   on Saturday said the civic body would check the feasibility for hike in water charges before implementing it. 

 The civic body has not implemented the 10% annual hike in water charges after widespread protests this year. 
 
 Replying to a query raised by Shiv Sena corporator  , the municipal chief said that the water distribution project launched under PPP model here in the city in 2014 was scraped and thus he would examine whether the terms and conditions made under the project could be implemented even after scrapping the project. 
 
 Earlier Ghodale said that the municipal body should not collect inflated charges from the consumers especially when water scarcity is at its peak. He also urged the municipal body to roll back the hike with immediate effect. 
 
 In 2011, when the   Municipal Corporation (AMC) had conceptualised the public private partnership (PPP) model water distribution project, the private agency and the civic body had agreed for a 10% annual hike in water charges. 
 
 Accordingly, the civic body hiked the charges in the past few years, but as the project has been scrapped with effect from July 2017 and water supply system in city is in a pathetic state, residents and corporators are opposing the price hike. 
 
 For the last fiscal, the water charges for residential category consumers drawing water from half inch thickness pipe was Rs 3,750 per annum, but for 2017-18 the amount was supposed to be Rs 4,125 per annum. Consumers falling under other categories were also supposed to 10% more than last yearâ€™s rates. The charges vary depending on the thickness of pipes and their category. 
 
 As there are no water meters installed at the door steps of the consumers here in the city, the municipal body collects water charges from the consumers based on the   and category of the consumers.
