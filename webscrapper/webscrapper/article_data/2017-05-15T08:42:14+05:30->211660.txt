HYDERABAD: The incidence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has increased in Hyderabad with more number of cases being reported in the city. According to city gynaecologists,   is more among women employed in the IT sector.
Doctors attribute the spurt in PCOS cases to urban lifestyle, stress and irregular periods. Doctors state that there has been a 20 per cent increase in PCOS patients. “Cases of PCOS are predominantly seen in the age group of 15 to 40 years. This was not the case some time back,“ Dr S  , secretary, Indian College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists said.
 
 PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age.Symptoms are irregular menstrual periods, irregu lar ovulation, weight gain, hair loss, oily skin or acne.However, symptoms vary from woman to woman. Dr  , consultant gynaecologist with Care Hospital said, “Currently, we get around 10 to 15 cases of women suffering from PCOS a week. Many teenage girls are suffering from PCOS.The main reason is sedentary lifestyle, but it can also be hereditary.“
 
 Most cases of PCOS are seen among women who work in the IT industry. Around 90 per cent of them constitute obese women. In lean women it is often caused due to genetic reasons. In some cases, it can lead to infertility. In a study conducted by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), it was found that one out of every four women suffer from PCOS. In another survey it was found that eastern part of India showed a higher percentage of women (25.88 per cent) affected by PCOS. The figure was 18.62 per cent in north India and 18 per cent in south India.
 
 Private practitioner Dr   said that another worrying aspect is that most women in the city don't know this underlining problem and attribute irregular periods to stress.
