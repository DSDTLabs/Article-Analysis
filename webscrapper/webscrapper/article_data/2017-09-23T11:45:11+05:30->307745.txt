VADODARA: The inaugural run of the   train got delayed as the train which was scheduled to be flagged off at 3.25 pm got left at 5 pm from platform number one. The flagging off got delayed as the video link from Varanasi was running late. 

 Deputy chief minister   who was supposed to flag off the train from Vadodara along   had to leave the function without giving green signal to the train. 
 
 The function at platform number 1 also resulted in quite a chaos as train movement. The VIP movement and the arrangements at the platform also disturbed the movement of commuters who had to board other trains.
