NOIDA: A group of job seekers have registered a complaint, accusing a private company of fraud, on the pretext of offering jobs. The complainants claimed they received calls from V  , based in Sector 4, offering them jobs. The telecaller had said the people could get data entry jobs and earn Rs 500-2,000 every day while working from home. If they were interested, they were told to subscribe to IDs by paying Rs 25,000.

 Sonu, a resident of Badarpur, said he had subscribed to the ID but the company did not give him any job.
 
 The complainants said about 500 people have subscribed to the company’s offer, and most of them feel cheated. “The company had promised extraordinary income, that too by working from home. I thought it was a lucrative offer and paid for two IDs. But the company did not offer us any work. We feel cheated. We’re visiting the company office often, but it’of no use,” said  , another complainant.
 
 A group of five such job seekers visited the police station and registered a complaint. Gaurav Grover, ASP  , said the police would investigate the complaint and take suitable action.
