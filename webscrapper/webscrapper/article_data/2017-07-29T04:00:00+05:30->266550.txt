Mumbai: Financial group   has drawn up plans to launch a bond house to specialise in government securities and other fixed-income instruments. The firm is understood to be applying to the   for a   (PD) licence.

 PD firms are RBI-recognised traders who buy and sell government securities and provide underwriting support to the government whenever it seeks to raise funds through bond issues. Currently, there are seven standalone primary dealers in India — I-Sec PD, Morgan Stanley India PD, Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, Nomura Fixed Income, PNB Gilts, SBI DFHI and STCI.
 
 According to RBI guidelines, any non-banking entity seeking to operate as a primary dealer should be registered as a non-banking finance company. The company should have a net-owned fund of Rs 150 crore for undertaking only government securities activities. Any firm that seeks to engage in the wider fixed-income business will need to have a capital of Rs 250 crore. 
 
 According to sources, Edelweiss plans to make a much larger investment given that it has a sizeable proprietary trading book in government securities. Edelweiss did not respond to a query from TOI.
 
 The RBI also requires that the applicant’s turnover in the   business during the year which precedes the one in which application is made for a PD authorisation should be at least equal to 15% of its total turnover and its assets in G-secs should be 15% of its total asset. 
 
 With interest rates expected to decline and inflation continuing to remain soft, the outlook is expected to be positive for   as well as dealers in government bonds. A drop in interest rates results in prices of government bonds rising.
