PANAJI: While ramps are usually strategically placed to provide access to persons with disabilities, the one at   is likely to present a hurdle rather than an easier way out. As soon as one reaches the platform, the oddly-placed ramp is obstructed by a cemented  .

 The ramp was built soon after   made it mandatory to have a ramp at all government offices. Though the ramp adheres to guidelines, there appears to be no thought put into its placement which went unnoticed all these years, until a local citizen raised the issue.
 
 “When taxpayers’ money is put into such initiatives, some thought should be put into its execution. Someone who wants to access the police station via the ramp will obviously find it difficult. It defeats the purpose of accessibility,” he said.
 
 The 1.5m-wide ramp starts as per the guidelines and steadily leads up to a higher platform. Once it reaches the turn, the aforementioned garden patch leaves a little over one foot width to pass. While senior citizens walking up may manage, a person with disabilities on a wheelchair is likely to face a serious problem.
 
 Police inspectors (PI) at the Agasaim police station on the contrary maintain that they have never received any complaints with regards to the ramp’s placement. “If senior citizens or persons with disabilities have an FIR to file, we personally go to their home. The ramp has never been used by anyone,” said a PI.
 
 Agasaim police inspector   said, “If the garden patch causes an obstruction, we will ask the PWD to get it out of the way.”
