MEERUT: Targeting the formations that are contesting the   for power in  , Prime Minister   on Saturday said that the word ‘scam’ was an acronym for  , Congress, Akhilesh and  , and that if the state was to progress, they had to go.

 “If you want UP to develop, get rid of this SCAM, made up of Congress, SP, Akhilesha dn Mayawati,” said Modi, addressing the Vijay Shankhnaad Rally, his first public meeting in the polbound state, here.
 
 Hoping to repeat the BJP’s unprecedented performance in the 2014 general election, when UP gave 73 seats to the NDA, Modi touched an emotional chord at his first rally in the state. "UP made me the PM in 2014 and I have a debt to pay to it. But no matter what I do the benefit does not reach the downtrodden because all the money and schemes I send to UP gets stuck in Lucknow,” he said.
 
 Attacking the SP-Congress combine, the PM said, “Until a month ago, the Congress was attacking SP on all fronts. But what happened overnight that these sworn political enemies are now locked in a friendly embrace? Those who cannot save themselves, how will they save UP?” Modi also attacked the opposition over surgical strikes. “There is a government at the Centre who knows how to live and die for our soldiers who are protecting our borders. There was a time when the enemy used to sneak into our territory at night and kill our soldiers. Our soldiers could not retaliate even armed with weapons because they never had permission.
 
 We gave a befitting reply to Pakistan through surgical strikes and look at our leaders who question the authenticity of those strikes. They are doing politics over our soldiers.”
 
 Significantly, Modi said that while people faced incovenience after demonetisation, now it was the hoarders of black money and the corrupt who were facing trouble.
