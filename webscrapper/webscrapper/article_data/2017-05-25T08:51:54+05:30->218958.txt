THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Industries minister A C Moideen has called for a joint effort to put pressure on Centre to backtrack from its decision to shut down or privatise various central PSUs in the state, including FACT. 

 In reply to a calling attention motion by   in the assembly on Wednesday, the minister said the Union government was initiating the sale of assets of central PSUs and to privatise loss-making companies. "The state government, with its stand to protect public sector institutions, has repeatedly asked the central government to retain the central PSUs in the public sector," he told the assembly.
 
 Now, NITI Aayog (the policy think-tank of the Centre) has listed out the PSUs to be sold or privatised, and Kerala will be the most affected, Moideen said. "The decision is to privatise FACT and to shut down companies including Hindustan Organic Chemicals Limited, Indian   Limited and Hindustan Insecticides Limited," he said.
 
 The BHEL ( ) has begun procedures for withdrawing itself from the centre-state joint venture BHEL-EML ( ) in Kasaragod, which has caused anxiety among workers. "Without working capital, the production here has come to a standstill. The HLL Life Care Limited is witnessing mass lay off, while   is in severe crisis following the scrapping of import duty," the minister said.
 
 "The privatization and sale of shares of various central PSUs in the state will adversely affect the state's interest. The situation calls for a concerted effort to protect these companies," the minister reiterated.
