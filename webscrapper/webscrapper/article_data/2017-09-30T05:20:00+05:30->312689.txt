Nagpur: The police and office of collector ignored conditions prescribed by heritage conservation committee while granting permission for   celebrations to be held at Kasturchand Park (KP), a Grade-I heritage open space. The two departments did not mention the prohibition on parking of cars inside KP while giving permission to the programme, a major condition put by the heritage conservation committee.

 Activist Janardhan Moon obtained copies of permission letters issued by the office of collector to Sanatan Dharma Yuvak Sabha and by Sadar police to collector for organising Dussehra celebrations at KP under the RTI Act. In the letter issued by the office of collector, there is no mention about prohibition on entry and parking of cars inside KP.
 
 “Parking should be provided free of cost to visitors. Parking should be done in prescribed parking area itself. Banners highlighting these conditions should be erected promptly. Organizers should engage personnel to ensure proper parking arrangements and no theft of vehicles,” the letter issued by collector’s office on September 14 said.
 
 Similarly, Sadar police in letter dated September 18 to collector about the programme actually said parking of vehicles should be only in given parking area inside KP.
 
 The heritage conservation committee on September 5 had prescribed five conditions while giving permission for the programme. It clearly mentioned collector has to ensure compliance of these conditions. One of the five conditions was parking for only two-wheelers should be allowed inside KP.
 
 A committee member told TOI even entry and parking of VVIP vehicles was prohibited inside KP. “Open space is listed as Grade-I heritage site. It is destroyed due to parking of four-wheelers. Dust is raised in large quantity when cars run inside the ground spreading on heritage structures— Band Stand etc. It was responsibility of collector’s office to mention all five conditions in the permission letter issued to Sabha,” he said.
 
 Moon also objected to Sadar police’s basic permission for   dahan itself. “I lodged complaint with collector Sachin Kurwe and CP K Venkatesham. Burning of effigies is not permissible as per Bombay Police Act. Police register an offence in case anyone is found burning effigy of any person. How can police give permission to burn effigy of Ravan? I’ve no objection to any religious or cultural activity but want to know from police whether such permission can be given or not,” he said.
 
 Sadar police said collector’s office was an authority to issue permission with conditions. “We just gave our suggestions for organising the event that too in response to letter received from collector’s office.” An official in collector office said the letter has asked organisers to comply with all conditions prescribed by the heritage committee.
 
 Secretary of Sanatan Yuvak Dharma Sabha Sanjeev Kapoor admitted permission was received from collector and police to allow parking of four-wheelers inside KP but said they would abide by heritage committee condition and not allow car parking inside KP. “Parking for four-wheelers has been provided at Bishop Cotton School ground and on road between RBI square and Liberty square,” he said.
