 A exercise that engages the whole body, push-ups work for your legs, thighs, triceps, chest and back. Start with 10.
 
 
 Who says you can’t exercise at the office? This freehand exercise allows just that. Simply place two chairs, a little distance apart, with their backs parallel to each other. Grip the chair backs, bend your knees slightly and do dips with the arms being parallel to the floor. After every seven dips, bring yourself back up.
 
 
  
 Get into a floor push-up position with your knees parallel to the floor and instead of your palms, place your body weight on your forearms. Keep the body straight, hold and relax.
  
 
  
 Lie on your back, keeping your arms by the side and your legs flat. Tighten the core and lift your legs overhead. Hold and slowly lower your legs back to the floor. Repeat.
 
 
 Lunges can be done anywhere and 
 target muscles in the lower body and the core. Do basic lunge movement and hold. You can also try stepping out to the side or step backwards.
