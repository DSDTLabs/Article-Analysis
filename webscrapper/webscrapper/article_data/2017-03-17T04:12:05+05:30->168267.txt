MUMBAI: The trial in the  , which was to have resumed on Thursday, has been put on hold till March 30. CBI sought two weeks’ time to file its reply to an appeal filed by the accused   and   in the Bombay High Court against the deposition of a police officer and said it would not proceed with any other witness till then.

 The husband and wife duo, accused in the   murder case had moved the HC last month to challenge an order of the trial court that allowed the police officer to give details of the confession made by co-accused-turned-approver, Shyamwar Rai. The testimony of Khar sub-inspector  , who was the first witness in the trial that began on February 23, was in violation of the law on admissibility of evidence, claimed the Mukerjeas. Dalvi was recounting what Rai had told the police about the murder case, soon after his arrest in another case.
 
 The couple wanted the HC to intervene and stay his deposition to prevent “miscarriage of justice”. The sessions court had deferred the trial till March 16 after the defence counsel objected to Dalvi’s testimony and the court’s order permitting part of the deposition said it would appeal before the high court.
 
 When the matter finally came up before Justice R V Ghughe of the HC on Thursday, the CBI sought time to file its reply to the challenge. The lawyer for Indrani, Sudeep Pasbola, said the CBI was free to call and examine another witness and proceed with the trial. But the CBI said it would like to wait.  , lawyer for Peter, said the second witness lined up by the CBI was a pancha witness, who would also testify to details of Rai’s confessions to the police, which had no evidentiary value.
 
 The trial into the April 24, 2012 murder will now resume after the HC passes orders in the matter.
