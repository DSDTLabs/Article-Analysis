KANNUR: BJP is planning to take up the issue of recurring violence in   suburbs and use it against the  . For this, national leaders of the party will visit the place in the coming days, said party leaders.

 BJP national executive member P K Krishnadas said that BJP sympathizers were continuously targeted in the area. “This is making life difficult for them in the CPM strongholds and it is high time central forces intervened. In the present context, the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) should be imposed in   and law and order must be maintained by central forces,“ he said.
 
 He said the BJP was forced to open a refugee camp for victims of clashes in Payyannur because their houses were no longer liveable and there was persistent threat.
 
 “A refugee camp is set up when there is war or natural calamity. Here, CPM has created such a situation by unleashing terror. This kind of attack (which forces people to flee) is an experiment and if this is successful, CPM has plans to experiment it elsewhere,“ alleged the BJP leader who added that this kind of violence is similar to the brutality perpetrated by Kashmir's militants.
 
 CPM has transformed Kannur into another Kashmir in a year and there are nuclear cells functioning in the district to perpetrate violence, he alleged. The BJP leader claimed that those who targeted its members had ties with some communal terrorist groups and sought an enquiry.
 
 He wanted a comprehensive probe after CPM said that the clashes ensued when bombs were hurled at its members by BJP men. Krishnadas alleged that even the police were siding with those who targeted BJP workers. He claimed that there were instances of planned robbery.
 
 However, CPM refuted the charges and said the BJP is planning to unleash violence in   by spreading lies against the CPM. The party added that the RSS was giving weapons training to cadres to create violence.
