KOLKATA/BURDWAN: The   has decided to follow a two-pronged strategy to tackle unbridled rumour-mongering on  . Even as thrust is being put to involve every strata of people to   — the clubs and even   are being roped in — the police are also ensuring the accused do not get away.

 On Tuesday, Burdwan police arrested four persons for using Facebook and WhatsApp to spread rumours across Purbasthali and Kalna, the epicentre of the problem. It was in Kalna eight days ago that the mob lynched a daily worker and injured four. “Till late night, we have nabbed two civic volunteers and two suspects. The civic volunteer at Purbasthali had used his Facebook account, while the one at Kalna used his WhatsApp account to spread rumours,” said SDPO (Kalna) Priyabrata Roy. Cops said some major arrests are also expected from Bhatpara in North 24-Parganas soon.
 
 The message from the top is clear — instead of blocking lines of communication like on earlier occasions, this time, the administration wants to fight misinformation with real-time communication and quick arrests on the ground. 
 
 “That we have been successful in sending the message across stems from the fact that not one such incident was reported across the state on Tuesday,” said an official.
 
 “Our probe has progressed and we are consulting our lawyers to slap stricter charges on the accused. Broadly, we have divided them into two groups — one, those directly involved in the lynching and two, those helping spread the rumours,” said a senior police officer at Bhawani Bhavan. 
 
 The seriousness of the drive can be gauged from the fact that the ADM (general) of Burdwan led a major raid on cyber cafes in Burdwan town to ascertain if they were “adhering to rules”. While four of them were showcaused for failing to adhere to rules, another was sealed.
