VADODARA: An arrest warrant under section 70 of criminal procedure code was issued by a local court here against notorious historysheeter Aslam  .

 The warrant was issued on Saturday after   police submitted a report to the court informuing that Bodiyo has been booked at least 60 cases in various police stations of the city and keeps changing his location to evade arrest.
 
 Police also told the court that since Bodiyo is a historysheeter, he is aware about the procedures of the police and therefore it is necessary that a strong case is made against him.
 
 Police said that now that the warrant is issued, any police department in the state can arrest him. “We have shared the copies of warrant with all the police stations in the city and neighbouring districts. We are hopeful in arresting him soon,” said A R Mahida, police sub-inspector, Navapura police station.
 
 Bodiyo was recently booked for rioting at Navapura police station after a police team of JP Road police station had conducted a cross raid in the jurisdiction of Navapura police station and had detained Bodiyo. However, Bodiyo suddenly started shouting for help and called the locals, who began pelting stones at the cops. Some of them even rushed towards the police team with iron pipes and stones. Bodiyo and other historysheeters including   and others escaped from the spot taking advantage of the situation.
 
 The police had later arrested 10 of his gang members for helping to escape from there.
