LUCKNOW: Now a dedicated   team will implement parking rules in   and the adjoining VIP areas of the city. On Saturday, an additional force of 61 cops was provided to the traffic police department for the same. The squad will have 14 traffic sub-inspectors (TSI) and 47 constables. They have also been provided 29 two-wheelers for vigil. 

 The move will help in streamlining traffic. So far, traffic police department had 463 personnel â€” 329 constables, 90 head constables, 37 TSI, 5 inspectors and 2 circle officers. The total number of registered vehicles in the city is 20 lakh. That makes one cop responsible for over 4,319 vehicles. 
 
 As a result, heavy traffic congestion and bottlenecks have been a daily affair at Rana Pratap Marg, Sapru Marg, Lalbagh, Park Road, Narhi, Vidhan Sabha Marg, Darul Shafa, Lalbatti Crossing, Vikramaditya Marg and Jopling Road. Traffic officials claimed roadside parking to be the prime cause of the regular traffic jams in these areas.
 
 As per the plan, there would be two constables each on 15 bikes to keep vigil while 14 TSIs will get bikes to patrol along with home guards.   said it is a pilot project to tackle the daily traffic congestion in Hazratganj area.

 SP (traffic)   said around 1,000 more traffic cops would be required if the project were to be implemented in entire city.
