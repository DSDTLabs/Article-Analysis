Jaipur: The Opposition smelled conspiracy on Friday when BJP legislator Manju Baghmar remained absent in the House though her question on cow deaths at city’s   Gaushala was listed for the Question Hour. 

 Speaker Kailash Meghwal passed the question as the legislator was absent.
 
 BSP legislator Manoj Nyangli tried to corner the ruling party over its MLA’s absence but the speaker got Nyangli’s remarks expunged from the House records.
 
 As per UDH department’s written replies to Baghmar’s questions posted on the assembly website, there were no sanitation workers at Hingonia during June and July last year when maximum deaths of cows were reported from the cattle shelter. The department said there were no workers during those months as its contract with the supply firm had been annulled. The government reply showed that before June-July 2016, there used to be at least 200 sanitation workers at Hingonia. 
 
 During the monsoon of 2016, thousands of bovines at Hingonia shelter were reported dead within a span of few days and the Vasundhara Raje-government was accused of apathy towards sick bovines despite having a separate department for cows. The high number of cow deaths made national headlines and the government subsequently posted 400 workers, besides arranging other facilities like fodder, water and veterinarians, at the shelter.
 
 The government on Friday said the causes of those bovines’ deaths were found to be sickness and malnourishment. Some of the cattle were already on the verge of death as they were brought at Hingonia due to old age or injuries due to accidents, the government said. “In some animals the cause of death was asphyxia shock, cardiac shock and septicemia shock,” the reply stated.
