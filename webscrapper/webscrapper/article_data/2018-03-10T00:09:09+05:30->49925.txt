Kolhapur: The civic administration found on Friday that one of its employees from the public works department (PWD) has set up an illegal cabin along Panchgaon Main Road from where encroachments have already been removed.  Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) has deployed over 50 workers to remove illegally set up cabins on the roadside. On Thursday, KMC removed close to 40 encroachments along Kalamba Road.  On Friday, the anti-encroachment drive was carried out in the stretch from ITI area to Pachgaon Road. At Ramanandnagar, the team found that a cabin was set up by one of the civic body’s temporary workers. When asked to remove the cabin, the alleged person opposed it and dialled local corporator Indrajit Bondre. A KMC official associated with the drive said Bondre asked them to stop the action. "However, we had to take action as it was the order from the top authorities. We removed the encroachment immediately," said the official. KMC is going to continue with the anti-encroachment drive on Saturday also. Higher authorities of the civic body are likely to call upon the leaders of all political parties and request them to tell every corporator not to intervene in the action being taken. “We had given sufficient time to the owners of the cabins to respond to our notice. However, only a handful responded. In the case of encroachments set up at open spaces, there is no need to even send a notice. We can directly take action without any prior notice. We have found many encroachments have mushroomed at public places which need to be devoted for public purposes,” said the official.  Corporator Bondre was not available for the comment.
