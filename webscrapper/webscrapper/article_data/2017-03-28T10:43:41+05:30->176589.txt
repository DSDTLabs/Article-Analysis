GUWAHATI: The prime accused in the   Aasu office attack,  , was sent to nine days' police custody by the Dhemaji chief judicial magistrate court on Monday. The state government has appointed senior advocate   as special public prosecutor in the case. 

 "Subodh will be quizzed extensively. So far, at least 52 people have been arrested in connection with the case and the investigation is taking the right direction," said Nilesh Sawakare, SP, Dhemaji.
 
 In addition to the charges of rioting, unlawful assembly, house trespassing, attempt to murder, mischief and promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth and language,   have slapped supplementary charges of criminal conspiracy, assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty, abetment and causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information upon Subodh, a source said.
 
 Sources added that police are also collecting evidence to book him under the National Security Act (NSA). The pressure to do so had been growing as protesters from various student bodies and social organizations in the district said he should be strictly punished for his 'inflammatory remarks'. Subodh is president of the Nikhil Bharat Bengali Udbastu Samannay Samiti (NBBUSS), a Nagpur-based Hindu Bengali outfit, members of which had vandalized the Silapathar office of Aasu on March 6. This reportedly occurred after Subodh and other NBBUSS leaders delivered provocative speeches, demanding Indian citizenship for Hindu Bengalis from Bangladesh, at a public meeting in Silapathar earlier that day.
 
 Subodh was taken to Dhemaji on Sunday after being arrested in West Bengal's North 24 Parganas district on Wednesday. He was brought to the state after a local court in   granted Assam police seven days' transit remand. He has already undergone a round of marathon quizzing by state police here.
