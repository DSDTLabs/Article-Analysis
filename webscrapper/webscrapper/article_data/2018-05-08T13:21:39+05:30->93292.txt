PATNA: The Patna   administration has tightened noose around   centres violating provisions of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act. Of the 52 such facilities inspected by teams of the district administration over the last one month, FIRs have been against two centres. Eight other centres, on the other hand, have been issued show-cause notices and two have got suspension notices for functioning without getting registered under the PCPNDT Act.

 Patna civil surgeon Dr Pramod Kumar   said an FIR was lodged against a Dhanarua-based ultrasound centre on April 14 for functioning without licence. “Another FIR was lodged against a Phulwarisharif-based ultrasound centre on April 17 for using the ultrasound machines despite the expiry of their registration permits,” he added.
 
 Dr Jha said show-cause notices have been issued to eight ultrasound facilities – three in Bihta, two each in Phulwarisharif and Danapur and one in Patna City. “These centres have been asked to reply to the notices within a week. Two ultrasound centres have been served suspension notices. Of them, one is located in   and another in Phulwarisharif,” the civil surgeon added. 
 
 District magistrate Kumar Ravi had constituted 12 teams, involving administrative officials, doctors and police personnel, in the first week of April to inspect 335 ultrasound centres in the district. The move was part of the administration’s bid to stop female foeticide and arrest the declining sex ratio. A TV news channel had conducted a sting operation showing a Kankerbagh clinic and a bypass road nursing home conducting sex determination tests earlier last month. The PCPNDT Act had banned sex determination and preconception sex-selection in the 1994.
