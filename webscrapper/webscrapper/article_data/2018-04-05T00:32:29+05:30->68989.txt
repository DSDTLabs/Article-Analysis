Tirupur: The parents of a Class X boy, who died on Wednesday under mysterious circumstances, alleged that their son died as he was beaten up after a quarrel with some students from a private school.

 However, the police said there were no external injuries and the cause of death could be ascertained only after the postmortem.
 
 According to the police, S Akilan of Muthanampalayam, who was studying in a private school on Dharapuram Road, was attending Class X board exams at KSC Government Boys Higher Secondary School. “The boy’s parents said he quarrelled with some students of another private school when he came to attend the exam on March 24 and subsequently he was beaten up near his house,” said an officer.
 
 Both the private schools came to know about the incident and warned the students not to involve in such activities. “Meanwhile, Akilan fell ill while attending a special class in his school on Monday. He was rushed to a private hospital. But his condition deteriorated and was referred to the Tirupur Government Hospital. But he died on Wednesday without responding to the treatment,” said the officer. 
 
 “We did not know whether he had any medical history. But the doctors told us that there were no external injuries. As a part of the postmortem process, they took his viscera samples. Only after receiving the postmortem report, we could tell anything,” said a senior police official. The Nallur rural police have registered a case under Section 174 of CrPC and investigations are on.
