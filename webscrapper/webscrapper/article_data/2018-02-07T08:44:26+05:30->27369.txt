COLVA: The South Goa Advocates’ Association has lodged a complaint with revenue minister   and the state registrar against Salcete sub-registrar  , alleging high-handedness on the part of the official. The association has demanded that Shetye be transferred immediately.

 Association secretary   da Costa, in a signed petition, stated that the association has received several complaints of alleged misbehaviour, incompetence and arrogance against Shetye, including from senior lawyers. 
 
 The petition stated that earlier, documents submitted for registration before the registrar would be approved within 24 hours, and alleged that Shetye does not check submitted documents for days together and sets the registration date for a week later unless the parties executing the deed or the lawyer “had a special relationship with him”.
 
 Senior citizens approaching the sub-registrar to register a will are especially inconvenienced due to delays, the petition stated.
 
 The petition also states that in the case of registration of sale deeds, parties/lawyers not familiar with Shetye are asked to produce a certificate from a government department stating that the property in question is located in the ward as stated in the deed. 
 
 No government department issues such a certificate and neither is any government department authorized to issue such a certificate, Costa said, adding that “in case the parties are unable to produce such a certificate, the parties are forced to value the plot at the highest rate payable in the city, irrespective of the location of the plot”.
