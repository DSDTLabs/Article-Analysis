LUDHIANA: The   MLA from Khanna, Gurkirat Singh Kotli, has claimed that the entire   city will get   and sewerage connections soon. 

 He said a 98km sewer line and a 105km water supply line were being laid in the city. Kotli said the projects were going to cost Rs 124.03 crore, but would change the face of the city. “Khanna was in dire need of such projects. Since the Congress promised to provide every civic amenity to the people, these two projects will be completed at any cost,” he said.
 
 Kotli claimed that the Congress-ruled state government had made development its “main agenda”. “Our leaders, be it chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh or any minister, MLA or councillor, everyone is working day and night to solve problems faced by people,” he said. “And people from all walks of life — youngsters, senior citizens and pensioners — are appreciating the change brought in the state by our government.” 
 
 Kotli added nine tube wells worth Rs 2.28 crore would be provided in the city and another Rs 3.77 crore would be spent on construction of five water tanks in Khanna.
