PANAJI: Investors in  , Exential, say his wife Valany, was an integral part of the company. “I have personally met her in the   for my funds and she introduced herself as the managing director of the company,” M Al Mashjari, one of the first complainants against the Ponzi scheme, told STOI from Dubai.

 Valany had, on Tuesday, denied her role as managing director of the company. “I used to help take care of the employees. My name is nowhere on the trade licence. I was only assisting Sydney. I don’t know the technical details,” she had said.
 
 Mashjari, who is an engineer with an airline and invested 5 lakh dirhams (around Rs 89 lakh), said there was enough evidence against Valany for breaking into the sealed office and taking out documents. “She can be seen in a video clipping provided to police here. If it was legal, then why was she using the backdoor of the building to remove all files and computers,” he asked.
 
 Vijaykumar Ranchhodbhai Patel from  , also said he met Valany at the Exential office. “She is no victim. She is talking about loss in trades, but the money which I paid never reached the financial broker. Instead, it was used to sponsor football teams and booking the World Islands for renewal of her marriage vows,” he said.
 
 “These are false accusations made out of jealousy,” Valany had told TOI on Tuesday. “Sydney definitely wants to help the clients and he is the only one who can. But he needs to be out so that he can trade and pay them back. He has a plan,” she had said.
 
 “Valany is making statements that her husband wanted to help people and that’s why he didn’t flee. The truth is he was just buying time and trying to get out of the country smoothly when he was caught,” Mashjari said.
 
 “This couple wanted to enjoy people’s savings. We don’t want any help from them. We just want our  ,” he said.
