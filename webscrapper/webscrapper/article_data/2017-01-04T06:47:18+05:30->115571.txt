PANAJI:   Bhuvimochan Samiti and the Congress slammed the state government for providing provisional sanads to villagers in Mayem-Bicholim.

 President of the samiti Kashinath Mayekar and secretary   alleged that the government has cheated the peopel as the provisinal sanad has no legal value.
 
 Secretary of   (AICC)   on Tuesday said that the provisional sanads given to around 60 Mayem villagers by defence minister   on Monday is yet another attempt to fool the people of Goa in general and Mayem in particular.
 
 “At the function Parrikar told another lie, as usual, that the function could not be held in Mayem because he was busy with elections. The real reason is that he or his party workers had no courage to face the people of Mayem with these provisional sanads,” Chodankar said.
 
 Mayem Bhuvimochan Samiti, which has been fighting the cause of evacuee property consistently, boycotted the function on January 2.
