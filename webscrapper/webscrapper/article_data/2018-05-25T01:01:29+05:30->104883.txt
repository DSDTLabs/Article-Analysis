NEW DELHI: Getting into   at   (JMC) may become more   with the   deciding to   certain   while introducing some  . On the other hand, it has included core, elective and functional English in the list of subjects to be accepted for calculating the best of four (BFS) for some honours courses.

 With this year, the JMC administration has changed a few of its criteria for admissions to the commerce and humanities courses. For example, while calculating the BFS for BCom (H), accountancy has been replaced with mathematics for calculating BFS. Now, using accountancy will call for a 1% deduction, as will inclusion of any subject other than maths, business studies/commerce, economics and computer science. 
 
 Similarly, in BCom (program), entrepreneurship has been added to the list of acceptable subjects for BFS while maths is no more compulsory. However, addition of any subject other than accountancy, business studies/commerce, economics, computer science and entrepreneurship will call for a 1% deduction each. Last year, addition of any of these subjects had given applicants a 2% advantage to the aggregate.
 
 The minimum required score in maths and economics, for those applying for BA (H) economics, has also been hiked to 75% from 70%. For BA (H) in political science, until last year it was enough to study the subject in the qualifying class, but applicants will now be given a 2% advantage for including it in BFS.
 
 The admission to JMC, which is a minority college, is through a separate application form. However, an applicant will have to generate a form/registration number on the DU centralised application portal before applying to JMC. The admission will not be completed until the registration number is submitted along with the JMC form.
