KOLKATA: The Kolkata Police top brass has approved the formation of a new division – the ninth in the city. To be called the East Division, it is expected to become operational as soon as   passes a final order.

 The division is being carved out of the existing South-East and the South Suburban ( ) divisions. It is likely to begin operations with at least six police stations. Five of these will be to the left of the EM Bypass (while moving from   to  ) while one will be on the right.
 
 Initially, Lalbazar has decided to bring in the recently acquired Kolkata Leather Complex police station along with Pragati Maidan, Anandapur, Panchasayer, Purba Jadavpur and  .
 
 A senior officer at Lalbazar said the plan was at an advanced stage, but refused to specify a date on which the new division will become operational.
 
 Top sources told TOI that a DCP-level officer has been selected to head the new division. However, lack of a suitable office has been holding up the announcement.
 
 “We had initially selected a facility in Anandapur. However, we had to ditch the plan due to technical problems. We have now identified a new facility in Survey Park near Sammelani College,” a source said.
 
 Sources said ensuring security on the Bypass and the Basanti highway will be the top priority.. The Leather Complex police station covers about 54sqkm. “Area surrounding the Ruby crossing is now a business hub. Rampant construction has posed new challenges for us. The new police stations have specific characteristics based o the area that they are catering to,” said an officer.
 
 Cops are also planning to divide the area under KLC police station into three as it is known as a crime-prone zone.
