 is keeping rather busy these days. The actress is back from Delhi where she was promoting her Bollywood film   that is releasing on 
 . Raima plays a mysterious character in this film who challenges and messes with Kay Kay Menon’s character, who plays a detective in the film. “I am looking forward to the film. The character is challenging and has many shades. I had a blast in Delhi. I have many friends staying there so it was a reunion of sorts! I also bought quite a few woolens as Kolkata is unexpectedly cold this year,” said the actress.
