NEW DELHI: Former India captain   reportedly finds himself in a situation where he must choose either   franchise   or continue his association with the BCCI under the capacity of India A and U-19 teams' head coach.

 According to a report in the Indian Express, BCCI is preparing new contracts which will be in tune with the   judgement on the cricket board's constitution. To avoid issues arising out of conflict of interests, the   (CoA) will offer contracts for a period of one year (12 months) from the next season. 
 
 Currently, Dravid is associated with both the BCCI and Delhi Daredevils (mentor). He is contracted to the BCCI for 10 months and with Daredevils for two months. This is where the bone of contention lies â€“ he cannot work for the club when associated with the national teams.
  
 The English daily quoted a BCCI source as saying that Dravid has no problem with the new arrangement and the board will compensate him by paying what he was earning via his association with the   and increasing his responsibilities within the national setup. 
 
 The report further said that the Indian cricket team's support staff that includes Sanjay Bangar, R Sridhar and Patrick Farhart, who have similar arrangements with other IPL teams, will also be offered the new contract.
