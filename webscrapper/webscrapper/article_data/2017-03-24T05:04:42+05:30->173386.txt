KOLKATA: After   came down heavily on the   on Thursday, the teacher recruiting body promised to depute an officer to respond to court cases. Its chairman Subiresh Bhattacharya said an officer will immediately be designated to respond to court cases. 

 The court of Justice Rajiv Sharma on Thursday also criticised the way SSC had been responding to court notices.
 
 In a petition, former Army man Shiladitya Sarkar had challenged sudden removal of the quota for the ex-Army men. 
 
 "The judge severely criticised the absence of SSC representatives despite several notices sent to them. The case will again be heard next week,' said Anindya Sundar Das, advocate for Sarkar.
