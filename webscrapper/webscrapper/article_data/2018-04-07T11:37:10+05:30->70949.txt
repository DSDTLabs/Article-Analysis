BHOPAL: A section of leaders in the ruling BJP expressed displeasure over the controversial decision to grant minister of state (MoS) status to five godmen. 

  veteran and former chief minister Babulal   criticised the saints and took a dig at Computer Baba, who was trying to get a   ticket through his political connections. He said the baba successfully got himself ministerial status without contesting elections or taking membership of the BJP.
 
 "This seem to be eighth wonder of the world. The saints neither applied for party membership nor contested any election but bagged MoS status. Other saints in the state will be unhappy with the government's decision since they also want to enjoy their share of power and security. If they manage to get such a status, they would also praise the government", Gaur said. 
 
 Joining the chorus, BJP veteran and Rajya Sabha member Raghunandan   said the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government should not have struck such a deal with the saints. This would please a few but, make the entire saint community unhappy and they will never favour the party.
 
 "This decision by the government would spread animosity among the saint community, dividing them into pro and anti-BJP groups. The government might have pleased a few saints but, made 500 others unhappy and they will not support the BJP at all", Sharma said.
 
 "The government decision will create a bad precedent and promote blackmailing", said Sharma.
 
 The saints who were accorded MoS status reached the Narmada bank in Khalghat and pledged to work for the conservation of the holy river. They were accompanied by other seers who planted saplings.
