VASCO: Coach   knows how to work miracles at Churchill Brothers since his arrival midway into the season. No wonder he starts every training session with a prayer and Saturday was no different as the Goan side geared up for their   clash against Shillong Lajong FC at the   in  .
 
  After going down closely to Minerva Punjab FC 4-5, Pereira has scripted three back-to-back victories which includes wins over title contenders Mohun Bagan and East Bengal. Their fine run has taken them from the bottom of the standings to sixth on the table with 15 points.
  
  “There are good times and bad times in life and I arrived during the good times of Churchill Bros. I am just here to guide the team which is working very hard,” Pereira said during the pre-match briefing as he prepares to avenge Churchill’s away defeat to Lajong.
  
  “We want to take each match as it comes and give our best. We have to treat our opponents on merit and hopefully, we will get good results,” said Pereira.
  
  Churchill will rely on their foreign strikers Anthony Wolfe and Ansumana Kromah to deliver the goods after the two finally seemed to have found the rhythm.
  
  Wolfe agree “Pereira has steadied the ship” and the former Trinidad and Tobago international is confident of a fourth consecutive win for his side.
  
  Lajong, however, are no pushovers. Thangboi Singto’s young boys had a bumpy ride in the beginning when they lost three matches but have since bounced back to occupy the fourth spot with 19 points from 12 outings.
  
  “We need to keep on improving because we are one of the youngest teams in the league. Goa has been a tough place for us always and it’s not going to be any different given Churchill’s form,” said Singto.
