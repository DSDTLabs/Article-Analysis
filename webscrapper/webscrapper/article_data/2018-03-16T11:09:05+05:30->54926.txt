TRICHY: Parents of many students who appeared for the accountancy paper of class 12   exam on Thursday had some anxious moments after rumours of a question paper leak started floating before the examination began. Fortunately for them, their wards had already entered the examination hall. 

 The ‘news’ of some questions being leaked originated from Delhi in the morning and soon went viral on social media platforms. However, CBSE came out with a statement in the afternoon rejecting such claims and also lodged a police complaint in this regard. “I came to know about the matter only at12 noon,” said  , president,   complex, but she said students remained unaffected as they had already entered the exam hall. 
 
 Officials said that the exam was conducted in a smooth manner in the schools though there were apprehensions of paper leakage which were later set at rest with the CBSE’s clarification. Saying that the possibility of a question paper leak was remote, principal of Sivananda Balalaya CBSE School, K Bhanumathi, said, “Question papers arrive from New Delhi to state headquarters through courier service and are kept in the bank lockers of concerned districts a week ahead. While the whole process remain highly confidential, the seal on the question paper in the exam hall is of a representative from each school writing the exam.” Similar rumours were spread ahead of class 10 English paper on March 12, she said.
