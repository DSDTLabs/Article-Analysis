Chennai: Tyre major MRF’s profits dropped sharply by nearly 25% drop for the financial year ended March 31. The company’s PAT dropped to Rs 1,092.3 crore compared to Rs 1,451.08 crore clocked in the previous financial year. Profit before tax was also down nearly 22.5% from Rs 2,066.4 crore in the year-ago period to Rs 1601.9 crore this time round. The company's board recommended a final dividend of Rs 54 per share ( 540 %) for the year ended March 31, 2018. With two interim dividends of Rs 3 each paid during the above year, the aggregate dividend for the year is Rs 60 per share or 600%. However the company’s total income (net of excise duty) saw an increase of just over 11% to Rs 15,104.4 crore FY18 as compared to Rs 13,580.8 crore in the previous year. After making provision for Income-Tax, the company's export for the year was Rs 1,353 crore, almost flat as compared to the Rs 1,316 crore clocked in the year-ago period. 

 The company’s other income came down in FY18 from Rs 328.6 crore the year ago to Rs 282.5 crore this time. Other expenses went up from Rs 2177.2 crore in the year-ago period to Rs 2409.5 crore this time. MRF stock, among the most expensive on the BSE, fell sharply by 3.39% to close at Rs 77045.7.
 
 The company's profitability dip comes in a year which saw some disruption in the form of the Goods and Services Tax but also a smart recovery in almost every automotive segment from passenger vehicles, to commercial vehicles, two wheelers and three wheelers.A good monsoon resulted in a healthy upswing in the agrarian economy and stoked a recovery in rural demand. Heavy spending on infrastructure by the government helped support long-tenn growth. However, the company sees escalation in the cost of crude based inputs as a concern which “will add pressure to the bottom-line. At the same time the competitive intensity in the industry continues to remain at fever-pitch due to anticipated 'on-streaming'' of several greenfield and brownfield capacities,” said a company statement.
