Conservationists in the city have called for an awareness campaign on identifying exotic tree species in the city and measures to weed them out. Though the trees add up to the green cover, in reality they cause irreparable damage to the ecosystem. Many of such rapid growing tree species not only spoil the soil but also add to the depletion of groundwater table, they say.

 The rain tree species which are native of USA grows rapidly and accelerate the depletion of groundwater in the course of its growth. They are not deep rooted and these trees cannot withstand strong wind. It is these trees that fell in large numbers in Chennai along with other exotic species during cyclone Vardha. But the native species could survive," says conservation scientist   from the Biodiversity Conservation Foundation. 
 
 Coordinator of Osai, an environmental organisation,   said it is unfortunate to find that saplings of exotic species could be found in the nurseries of the forest department. The government should come up with a strategic plan to grow more native species.
 
 Known as tree man of Trichy, Kesavan, who was instrumental in adding up to the green cover of the city, said there is a need that we all take a pledge to raise only native species from now on, which would gradually weed the exotic species out and we donâ€™t have to remove them.
