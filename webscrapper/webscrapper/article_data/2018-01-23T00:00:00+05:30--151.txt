His is a typical case of an IT professional whose passion lies in the arts — theatre, television and films. “I’ve always had a flair for acting but opted for a conventional career in the IT sector given its financial security. But I wasn’t satisfied doing a 9-to-5 job. Circumstances too conspired and when I got the opportunity to work according to US timings, I got plenty of time on my hand. Until 3 in the noon I was free to pursue my first love,” shares Ram Manjjonath. Theatre is his mainstay and Ram has been part of plays like Basava Express, Uttarabhoopa Beechi, 8/15, Huttadalli Hutta and Vicharane Naditide among others. “Then came the opportunity to do teleserials.   was a rage then and I was lucky to kickstart my television career with that serial. This was way back in 2004. Then after a brief hiatus, I did   followed by a tele play for Doordarshan which is telecast every year during Gandhi Jayanthi — it is based on the freedom struggle,” shares Ram. He also did  , a programme on crime followed by Shantam Paapam. “In Shantam Paapam, they never enlist actors more than once. But I was called twice to be part of the project,” he tells us. 
Ram then did Neeli which required him for a long stint. “I played a seer in it and that was interesting,” he avers. Ram’s most recent stint was  . “I was doing the casting for the serial when the makers whom I’m close to suggested that I play a part. So I did that,” smiles Ram. He has also been part of films that include U-turn, Srinivasa Kalyana, Jeerjimbe, Lucia and Badmaash. “For me whether it’s TV, films or theatre, the medium is immaterial. I love the fact that I get to play so many different personalities and that is gratifying. After all, how many IT engineers get the opportunity to act? I’m glad I have the best of both worlds,” sums up Ram.
