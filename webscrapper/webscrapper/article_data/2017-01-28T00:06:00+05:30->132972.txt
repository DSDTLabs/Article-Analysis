Pimpri Chinchwad: The Nationalist Congress Party in Pimpri Chinchwad has an advantage in the civic election in Pimpri Chinchwad as the BJP and   are going to contest all the 128 seats on their own. 

 The anti-NCP votes are bound to be split between the two parties. Political observers said the  , which has been winning with brute majorities in the last two municipal elections, could be dislodged only if there was an alliance between the saffron parties. The Shiv Sena won 14 seats, the BJP won just 3 seats in the February 2012 municipal elections. 
 
 Chinchwad BJP MLA and city unit president Laxman Jagtap said, “The break-up with Shiv Sena will not have any impact on the electoral fortunes of the BJP in the civic elections. Guardian minister Girish Bapat is talking to other parties like RPI (Athavale group) about an alliance. Nominations will be given to candidates considering their poll merit.”
 
 “The NCP has been defamed due to corruption in the development works in the  . Voters are disappointed with the NCP. A large number of NCP leaders and workers have joined the BJP recently which has angered the BJP workers. Shiv Sena will fight all the 128 seats on its own. We expect a hung house after the elections in which Shiv Sena will be the kingmaker,” Shiv Sena MP from Maval Shrirang Barne said.
 
 Yogesh Behl, spokesperson of the Pimpri Chinchwad unit of the NCP, said, “If there would have been an alliance it would have been beneficial to the NCP. But the BJP and Shiv Sena will get their own votes while NCP will get its votes. We will come back to power.”
 
 The BJP’s survey states that it could win about 75 to 80 seats (Bhosari assembly constituency 27 to 32 seats, Chinchwad assembly constituency 29 to 34 seats, and Pimpri assembly constituency 16 to 21 seats). 
 
 The Shiv Sena too has conducted a survey, but is keeping its cards close to its chest. An alliance may happen only after the election results are declared next month.
