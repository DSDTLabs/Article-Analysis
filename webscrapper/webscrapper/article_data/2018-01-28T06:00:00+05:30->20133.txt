Taking Hyderabad’s entrepreneurial spirit to a global level, two Hyderabadi women —   and   — made heads turn as they represented India at the ongoing   (WEF) in  .

 Kanika and Dipika were chosen as part of the Global Shapers team, which selected a delegation of 50 young entrepreneurs from across the world. The fact that both of them spoke on topics of inclusion, makes their feat all the more special. While Kanika spoke about the importance of providing equal opportunities to social entrepreneurs, Dipika spoke about how to build inclusive cities.
 
 “The WEF mostly deals with senior leadership of big businesses and yet, here we are, a bunch of start-ups and social entrepreneurs, conveying what the youth want from the world,” says Dipika, who runs a civic innovation start-up called Lakeer. Kanika, on the other hand, has been finding solutions for social entrepreneurial ventures through a Mumbai-based startup called Aavishkaar Intellecap. 
 
 The duo also met Telangana’s IT Minister   and his team in Davos. “Hyderabad is really showing the way. They are creating a good eco-system for entrepreneurial ventures to grow. The T-Hub is one such venture but we need more of those and events like GES and WEF are only going to show the way forward,” says Kanika.
 
 Meanwhile, Dipika, whose venture is based out of Hyderabad, has already set her goals on what she wants to achieve for the city. “Hyderabad is a dynamic city. We are looking forward to working with the government and my target is to develop at least 10 model wards where citizens of Hyderabad and government can work in partnership. And these wards must be across all economic sectors and not just another hitec City,” she adds.
