New Delhi: Major   and financial institutions have assured   (NHAI) of fast-tracking signing of financing agreements with private highway developers for over a dozen projects worth Rs14,000 crore, awarded under the “hybrid annuity” model. Under this model,   pays 40% project cost during construction and refunds the rest of the cost in instalments over 10 years in 20 instalments. 

 Sources said the deadline to tie up finances is over in seven cases, which triggered Union   minister   and top ministry officials and NHAI to rush to Mumbai on Monday to reach out to banks. TOI learnt that top executives of 16 banks, including of SBI, Central Bank, Canara Bank, IDBI, ICICI and IFCL attended the meeting.
 
 Sources said while few “hybrid annuity” contracts awarded may be terminated, in all other cases financial closure will happen soon. Banks have shown interest in financing another five projects worth Rs7,700 crore, awarded under build, operate and transfer (BOT) mode. 
 
 “We discussed issues relating to 11 stressed projects involving nearly Rs10,000 crore investment, where banks are also facing a problem because of no or slow progress. In few cases, lack of liquidity with developers hit projects. The government has approved putting a one-time fund to complete the projects so that toll collection can start to repay the loan,” said a source who attended the meeting. 
 
 He added that Gadkari has told NHAI to have a representative each from the bank concerned and highway authority for every stressed project to find out quick solution, so that work can start immediately.
 
 NHAI also showcased on Monday how there are huge investment opportunities for banks as it plans to roll out projects of nearly Rs60,000 crore in three to four months.
