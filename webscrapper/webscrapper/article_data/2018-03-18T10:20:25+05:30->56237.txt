Bhubaneswar: Students of   (RD) Women's University on Saturday staged a dharna in front of the university's main gate to press for land for a second campus and a rollback of the government's decision to abolish teaching posts of  . 

 The students also blocked the Janpath (the road between   and   square) near the university for more than an hour. Vehicular traffic was affected for an hour.
 
 The protesters said the state government had created three universities on May 30, 2015, including RD Women's University. "The two other universities have already got land for their second campuses but we are yet to get anything. Due to this, our university cannot hold a sports meet, nor does it have modern laboratories and research centres," said Soubhagya Soumyashree Samal, president of university's students' union.
 
 She said they had urged the state government to not abolish the RD Autonomous College and its teaching posts. "The government can bring the college within the jurisdiction of the university without abolishing it," she added. A delegation led by her met higher education secretary   on Saturday afternoon. "We are not satisfied with the answers of the secretary and will continue the agitation," said Samal. 
 
 Sarma said the state government was working on finding a suitable place in the city for the second campus of the university. On the abolition of posts of the autonomous college, he said the students should understand that the college had been upgraded to a university. "We will try to make them understand the issue," he added.
