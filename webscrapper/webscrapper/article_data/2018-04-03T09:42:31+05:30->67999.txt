HYDERABAD: Dalit groups in the city joined a nationwide   call on Monday, holding rallies that brought traffic to a halt in many areas of the city as well as in the districts.

 While protests turned violent in other parts of the country, dozens of protesters in Hyderabad took to the streets from early morning in a largely peaceful demonstration.
 
 The Bharat Bandh was called to protest a recent   ruling, which Dalit activists say dilutes the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. In a review petition drafted by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, the Centre is likely to contend that the order will weaken the provisions of the Act, thereby reducing the fear of law.
 
 Raising their voice against the petition, members of Dalit Protection Force protested in front of Ambedkar statue in Domalguda, as they argued that dilution of the provisions of the Act might lead to increase in violence against Dalits.
 
 Students of University of Hyderabad also supported the bandh call.  , member of Joint Action Committee for Social Justice, which spearheaded the Justice for Rohith Vemula movement in 2016, tweeted, “About 90% of Supreme Court judges, 90% of VCs of Indian varsities, 93% of corporate board members in India are upper caste Hindus. When a majority of these institutions are headed by people Caste-Hindus, the Supreme Court blames SC/ST PoA Act as perpetuating casteism. #BharatBandh.”
 
 Vemula’s brother   too posed a direct question to Congress party, YSRCP, CPI and Jana Sena on social media. “Why don't you support Bharat Bandh? Is special status more important than the lives of 25 crore people,” asked Vemula in a Facebook post.
 
 
 Dalit organisations staged ‘rasta roko’ in many parts of the state, including Karimnagar and Jagtial, bringing traffic to a halt. A few protesters tried to prevent Telangana State Road Transport Corporation buses coming out of their depots.
