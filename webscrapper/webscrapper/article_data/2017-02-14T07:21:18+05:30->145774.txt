AHMEDABAD:   and Exhibition is scheduled to be held at   in Gandhinagar from June 30 to July 2, 2017. The three-day global textile industry event will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

 “The government is organizing Textile India Conclave and Exhibition in Gujarat, which will be a big platform for industry players to showcase their products,” said textile secretary, government of India,   during a regional conference on textiles in Ahmedabad on Monday.
 
 “Big players (of the textile industry), who source from India, chief operating officers (CEOs) and industry leaders are expected to participate. There will also be business-to-business (B2B) meetings,” added Verma, who was in Ahmedabad to interact with textile and apparel industry representatives about the Rs 6,000 crore special package announced for the sector.
 
 Even six months after the package was announced, it has found few takers as too few applications for benefits have been received.
 
 According to senior government officials at the industry interaction, the package has not taken off as was expected.
 
 “The scheme was launched six months ago, after accommodating suggestions and demands from the industry. However, it has not translated into an increase in investment, employment generation or more exports,” Verma.
 
 The interaction was aimed at understanding the reasons for the lukewarm response. The government is also planning to reach out to industry players by meeting associations and camps to further explain what the package constitutes. “Not everyone is aware of the scheme. Awareness needs to be raised. We have asked the state government to chip in,” Verma said.
