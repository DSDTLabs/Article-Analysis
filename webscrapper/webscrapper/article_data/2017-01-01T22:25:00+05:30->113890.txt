Mangaluru: Parivarthan Charitable Trust is organizing an Aadhaar registration camp for transgenders at its office, which will continue till January 2. The camp was held under the guidance of DC K G Jagadeesha.

 During a meeting held at the DC’s office on December 17, after hearing grievances from   community in obtaining Aadhar card, bank account, ration card and housing, Jagadeesha directed the department of women and child development to look into the matter. The DC also informed the department concerned to issue Aadhaar cards to them without any discrimination. Based on the order of the DC, Parivarthan Charitable Trust took the initiative to assist the transgenders.
 
 The   camp was launched on Friday at the Trust office. Sanjana, a transgender, said, "Before setting up of the trust, we were not recognized by anyone. Now we are seeing some changes and are hoping for the best. Like everyone else, we too want to do something and be self-reliant, which is possible after obtaining some skills. So we have decided to enrol for self-development training. Under such a scheme, I have applied for a beautician course. Parivarthan Trust is working relentlessly for welfare of transgenders.”
 
 Managing trustee of Parivarthan Charitable Trust Violet Pereira said, “We have various plans to bring transgenders to the mainstream. This is for the first time that a special Aadhaar enrolment camp is being held for transgenders in the state, who were facing discrimination in the society. Recently, we had applied for a government self-employment scheme and already 10 applications have been approved under it.”
