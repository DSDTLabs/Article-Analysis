PUNE: The Pune division of the MSRTC will soon start running five   sleeper coach buses on three routes — Pune to Goa, Pune to Belgaum (Karnataka) and Pune to Shahada.

  
  
 
 “These will be new buses with sleeper coaches for the passengers, which are not present in the current Shivshahi vehicles. Each of these three routes will have two buses each and their timings and days will be announced soon,” an official of the   (MSRTC) said.
 
 Apart from the above three routes, these buses will also be launched on Mumbai to Goa and Aurangabad to Goa routes in the near future. “We have received the buses and they will start plying within a week or two,” the official said.
 
 Pune has got the largest share of the semi-luxury Shivshahi buses across the state. The Pune division has been introducing these air-conditioned buses across different routes with the objective to slowly replace the non-AC Hirkani buses. Last year, MSRTC had launched Shivshahi buses to Goa. “The response on the route has been decent with more than 60% passenger load,” the official said.
 
 “The new buses have   cameras and mobile charging points. Further, the passengers travelling in them will be given a blanket and a pillow. We will monitor the performance of the buses on these routes and will add more routes,” he added. 
 
 Rahul Sargam, a Pune resident, said, “Going to Goa on a flight is always a costly affair and in trains, the tickets are always on waiting list. The buses are a good idea and though the journey will be long, the sleepers will be comfortable.”
