COIMBATORE: Forest officials of the   range near   have started an inquiry after an activist complained about a group of men who laid out nets inside the reserve forest to poach birds and rabbits.

 S   said on Sunday around 6pm, two men set up traps and even caught a few birds that came under the schedule list of the Wildlife Act. When he questioned them, they threatened him and even caused a small injury on his fingers using knives. “They killed a bird and threw it at me and left,” he said. He immediately informed Kangeyam range officer N   and the   police station.   told TOI that they had already begun an inquiry into the incident. “Near Chinnamolarpatti, a few cases have been reported even in the past.
