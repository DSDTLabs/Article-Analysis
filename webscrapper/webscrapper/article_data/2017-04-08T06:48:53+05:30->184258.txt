NAGPUR: The state’s Common Entrance Test (CET) cell is preparing for a busy season ahead with a slew of exams slated to start from April. Maharashtra’s exam conducting body for higher education has ensured that it conducts maximum tests online itself to increase transparency, an initiative which started last year itself. 

 Shashank Chiklikar, exam coordinator at   said, “Going online not only increases transparency but also ensures that problems of paper leak and other logistical issues are completely taken care of.” 
 
 Online applications for the BEd CET have started and it’s expected that the number of students appearing for it is higher than that of last year. Chiklikar said, “Last year there was confusion because private colleges kept on telling candidates that there will be a separate exam for them.” The intake capacity for last year was 37,730 but only 12,368 seats were filled. Total 19,408 students had appeared for the exam. Most private colleges question the need for a CET for BEd considering that so many seats are lying vacant. A private college principal however asserted that having a CET is important. “Just because seats are available does not mean that anybody can apply to become a teacher. In our college we would like to get quality students who will ultimately participate in nation building, by imparting education to school kids. An oversupply of seats will auto correct itself with colleges shutting down in the next few years,” said the principal.
