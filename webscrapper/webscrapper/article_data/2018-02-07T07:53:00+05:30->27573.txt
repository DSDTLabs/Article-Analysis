Ludhiana: A local court has sentenced a 31-year-old man to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for raping a minor on the pretext of marriage. 

 A fine of Rs 2 lakh has also been imposed on the convict. In case of non-payment of fine, he will have to undergo another two years of imprisonment.
 
 On October 21, 2014, the victim’s mother had told the police, “When I woke up, I found my 15-year-old daughter missing. Later, we found that our tenant had also left his room without informing anyone.” 
 
 After two days, the police traced the tenant, who had taken the minor along with him to Delhi. The Class VI student told the police that the accused had been raping her for the past two months. “Around 11pm on October 20, 2014, he again violated me. The next morning he took me to Delhi on the pretext of marriage. There, too, he repeatedly violated me.” 
 
 The accused was booked under sections 363 (punishment for kidnapping) and 366 A (procuration of minor girl) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). After his arrest, Section 376 (rape) of the IPC was also added following the minor’s medical examination.
 
 The accused, during trial, pleaded that he was being implicated. He claimed that the two of them were Muslims and a 15-year-old Muslim girl could marry. The defence contended that the duo got married out of their own choice on October 22, 2014.
 
 The court however observed that from the version of the prosecutrix, it was made out that her consent to perform Nikah was forcibly obtained by the accused. The court also added that under the provisions a man is said to commit rape with or without the consent of woman, when she is under 18 years of age. “The girl was below 16 years of age at that time. Therefore, her alleged consent is immaterial,” the court held.
