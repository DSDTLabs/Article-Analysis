NEW DELHI: A former boxer has been arrested for stealing Rs 3 lakh that he had collected from a business partner of his employer. 

 Rajesh Kumar, who had faced hardship following a series of injuries, initially cooked up a story that criminals had snatched the money from him. However, using CCTV footage, the police nailed his lies and arrested him and an accomplice, Vinay Madhav. Kumar later told the police that he needed the money for treatment as he wanted to return to boxing and take part in more championships. 
 
 On February 20, Kumar himself filed a complaint with the police saying while he was returning to his workplace after collecting the money, two men came speeding on their bike, used pepper spray on his face and robbed him of the bag containing the cash. 
 
 However, during questioning, Kumar could not give satisfactory answers, which made the police suspicious. “A team led by Punjabi Bagh ACP Ankit Chauhan was formed and the scene was recreated. The CCTV footage of the entire stretch was also examined,” said Vijay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police (west). It was found that the former boxer himself had planned the robbery with two of his gym partners. 
 
 Kumar didn’t accept his involvement in the crime till he was shown the CCTV footage in which he was dividing the loot among the three accused. “The former boxer said he had won several competitions but was forced to work as the personal security officer of a businessman following his injuries,” said an officer.
 
 The police said both Kumar and Madhav were DU graduates. The third accused has been identified but is yet to be arrested. 
 
 The entire amount of robbed cash was recovered from the duo and the bike used in commission of the crime was found in their possession too.
