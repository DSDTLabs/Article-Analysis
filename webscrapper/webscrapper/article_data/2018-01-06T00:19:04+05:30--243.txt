More than 75% of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) buses stayed off the road in Coimbatore district in response to the strike called by unions on Friday.

TNSTC general manager Govindaraj said Coimbatore region (district) has 1,071 buses, including 723 town buses. He said they managed to operate 40% of buses across the district. “The regional transport officials selected 40 drivers for TNSTC, Coimbatore region, on temporary basis and they joined for duty. The RTOs are planning to select more drivers to operate the TNSTC buses,” he said. Coimbatore division of TNSTC comprises Coimbatore, Nilgiris, Tirupur and Erode districts. The division has 2,911 buses. More than 700 buses were operated in TNSTC Coimbatore division. More than 500 buses were parked inside the TNSTC two depots at Ukkadam and another two depots at Sungam.
