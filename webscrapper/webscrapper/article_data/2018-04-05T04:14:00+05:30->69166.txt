Vadodara: The overflowing drains in the Warasiya area of the city that had led to angry representations over the last few days have been attributed to a large rock thrown inside a manhole. 

 The rock was removed late evening on Wednesday after hectic efforts by the civic body.
 
 Officials of the civic body had identified a block in the drainage near the Pramukhswami Society in Warasiya. 
 
 When they checked the line, they found the large stone in it. The stone had moved inside the gutter line and had to be tied with a rope to pull it out. Sources said that mischief mongers may be behind the incident.
