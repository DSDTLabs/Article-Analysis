 He added that Maharashtra's draft policy will be vetted by the defence ministry as it must be in sync with the Centre's policy . Citing problems in setting up defence units, Desai offered the example of a prominent engineering firm that had expressed interest in setting up a defence manufacturing unit in Maharashtra and had approached the defence ministry for the same. The firm was informed that one of the conditions to set up a defence manufacturing unit was that they must own land.The company then approached MIDC who sold them the land. “When they went back to the defence ministry they were told that the defence company must be an independent entity and the land must be in the name of the new entity.
