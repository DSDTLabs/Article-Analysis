VADODARA: Notorious bootlegger and one of the kingpins of   ( ) bootlegging in the state, Ashok  , was nabbed by the   police after being on the run for seven years.

 Carrying a Robinhood-like image in his native place, Palanpuri was involved in at least 70 liquor haul cases registered by the police.
 
 Ashok Ramanlal Parmar, better known as Ashok Palanpuri, had made the union territory of Daman his base in the last seven years and used to operate from there. While he visited areas in Halol taluka of Panchmahal district, he had managed to evade arrest so far.
 
 The police had received tip-offs regarding his movements and formed teams to nab him. A tab was being kept on his movements since quite some time now. Palanpuri was hiding in the forest area near Pavagadh when the police teams surrounded him and nabbed him.
 
 Since 2009 itself, 28 cases of bootlegging were registered against Palanpuri by the Panchmahal police alone. Along with cases registered in other districts across the state, the number is expected to go as high as 70 to 80, police sources said. One of the biggest hauls of liquor linked to Palanpuri was made in June 2012 when IMFL worth Rs 61.68lakh was seized from Rayankhant village in Panchmahal.
 
 Palanpuri got his name from the   village in Halol taluka to which he belonged. 
 
 Knowing his whereabouts was tough for cops as few in the villages around Palanpur were willing to give information about him or liquor stashed by him in the area. He used to help people in the area who in turn either aided him or turned a blind eye to his operations.
