GUWAHATI: Assam’s first BJP government, formed in alliance with   and  , completes its first year in office on Wednesday. 

 BJP unseated Congress, which had been in power in the state for 15 years. The historic change of guard increased BJP’s appetite for further conquest in the northeast under the leadership of PM  . To achieve this, it set up the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a common platform for all regional parties of the region with the greater objective of winning at least 20 of the 24   seats in the region in 2019. 
 
 The fact that Assam has become the launchpad for BJP’s expansion plans in the region can be gauged from Modi’s visit to Guwahati on Friday from where he will address the nation, marking the third anniversary of the NDA government at the Centre. No one knows better than Assam CM   how the victory last year gave wings to BJP’s dreams of capturing the northeast. “Modiji has genuinely won the hearts of the people of the northeast by his honest, dedicated and committed efforts to develop the country and the region. I believe this is why more and more NE states are voting for BJP. Every state here desires to have a BJP government because Modiji is there and Assam was the starting point,” Sonowal told TOI.
