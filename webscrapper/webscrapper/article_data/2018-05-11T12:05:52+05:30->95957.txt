JODHPUR: Arguing in the high court on Thursday, the police commissioner of Jodhpur Ashok Rathore apprised the court of the difficulties in nailing the criminals on account of their high-tech modus operandi. "While the criminals have been adopting high end technology in carrying out the crimes, the police has been stuck in age old laws, which have been holding back the police from nailing them", Rathore argued in the court. 

 Rathore had appeared in the court in relation to a prayer for allowing permission for taking voice sample of Vikramjeet Singh alias Vikka, an accused of murder of an electronics trader   and an aide of the gangster Lawrence Bishnoi. 
 
 Citing the differences, Rathore stated that in such a scenario, there are the constitutional rights of criminals on one hand and on the other hand, there is the interest of common man.
 
 "The laws, which the defence counsel has cited, are the laws from 1980 whereas we have been living in the year 2018. On one hand there are the rights and interests of the criminals, who have been getting technically advanced, there are the interests of common man also on the other hand", he argued.
 
 Drawing a parallel between the god and the judges, Rathore stated that there is god above, there are the judges of high court and   on the earth, who represent the justice system.
 
 Emphasising the need of voice sample of the accuse, Rathore said that in proving the case, there is a dire need of the voice sample of the accused. Protesting the prayer, however, the defence counsel stated that the plea was not maintainable under section 482 of Cr PC.
