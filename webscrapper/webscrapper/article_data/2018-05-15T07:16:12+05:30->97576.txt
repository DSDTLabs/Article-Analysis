NEW DELHI: It was the perfect mix for conspiracy theorists: an Indian MP, the mysterious death of his wife, and a   in the centre of storm. Police say this was what that made the   case doubly controversial. 

 Pushkar died two days after a public spat with   on Twitter. It started with intimate messages allegedly between   and Tarar being shared on Tharoor’s Twitter account by Pushkar. Accusing Tarar of stalking and having an affair with her husband, Pushkar had called Tarar an ISI operative.
 
 Tarar had posted mocking retorts on Twitter. “So I ‘stalk’ on BBM and phone. The last I checked, it was a two-way thing, or maybe technology changed while I ‘stalked’?” she had tweeted. 
 
 The tiff made big news, and Pushkar was upset about it. Pushkar had also clarified that her account hadn’t been hacked and it was really she who was tweeting. “She is stalking my husband. And you know how men are. He is flattered by the attention. I took upon myself the crimes of this man during IPL. I will not allow this to be done to me. I just can’t tolerate this. I have nothing more to say,” Pushkar had said.
 
 After trying for two years,   eventually managed to convince Tarar for a round of questioning at a five-star hotel in Delhi. Only a handful of people actually knew about it, and TOI was the first to report it on July 18, 2016. She was confronted with a questionnaire and had denied having any affair with Tharoor. 
 
 Tarar had figured prominently in the statements of several people connected with the case, including journalist Nalini Singh, who had said Pushkar wanted her help in retrieving some BBMs exchanged between Tharoor and Tarar. Pushkar had apparently told Singh that Tharoor would marry Tarar after the 2014 General Elections.
