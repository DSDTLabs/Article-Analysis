Ludhiana: At a time when parents are worried about the immunisation of their children with measles and rubella (MR) vaccination after the fake video, Dr Gagan Sharma, who has been appointed in Ludhiana by the World Health Organization (WHO), said the vaccination is fully safe and meets the WHO standards.

 “The MR vaccination campaign is kicked off by the Union government to phase out measles and control the cases of rubella by 2020. For controlling the transmission of the virus, the children are to be vaccinated in one time. This MR vaccination is going to replace the measles vaccination in routine as well,” said Sharma.
 
 On being asked whether a child who has been vaccinated earlier also needs to take the vaccination, he said It does not matter whether the child has been vaccinated earlier or not. “This is because we are giving one additional dose to all children within the age group of 9 months and less than 15 years together. But, in case the dose of measles vaccination for any child is due in the coming days, then parents should keep 28 days difference after getting this additional MR vaccination.”
 
 He added that it is a pre-qualified vaccination and it is written on it that it meets the WHO standards. “Already seven to eight crore children are covered in 13 states of the country including Chandigarh, Himachal Pardesh and the entire south India. It has been noticed that cases of measles have reduced drastically and rubella has also come under control. Moreover, the vaccination is completely free of cost,” he said. 
 
 Talking about the side-effects of this vaccination, he said the MR vaccine being used in the campaign is completely safe. “However, like with any other injectable vaccine, there could be a transient mild pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever, rash and muscle aches,” he added.
