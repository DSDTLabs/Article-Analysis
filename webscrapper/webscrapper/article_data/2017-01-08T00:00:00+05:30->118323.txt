We are living a   and I wanted to break free and feel the change in me. You can change this constantly, and you must. If there is something you do not like in your life, change it. You have the power. The higher perspective of life is self not ego, though ego is often mistaken for self. 

  changed me. Now, I realise that everything and everyone in our lives is there for a reason – a reflection of self, of what must change, or what must not. What turned my life around was my participation in the Ayahuasca ceremony with shaman priests. Ayahuasca is a tea made from two vines in the Amazon Valley. One drinks it in a spiritual ceremony that enables one to journey out of his/her body. I was reminded of the gifts I had from my sacred past lives; healing, and speaking with the spirit world. I now live my life in the present, as I know that is all there is... I do not give my life away anymore to the past or future as they simply do not exist.
 
 Recently I started Kundalini Yoga, which is extremely powerful. I entered my past lives fully aware. It has enabled me to be a quantum being, one that lives her life from the soul and not the body. I realise we have karma to fix, and can get released from all karmic contracts made in our past lives. I want to tell people that meditation makes you feel free like a child – to play, to smile, to cry, to not judge anything.
