LUCKNOW:   seeking admission to computer science engineering will have greater opportunity to pursue the course at   from the new academic session.

  has increased 50% seats in the stream keeping in mind the demand for the course.
 
 
 “Last year, the number of applications for BTech in computer science was the highest among all engineering streams. The number of seats was 60 and the applications received was around
 
 240. The university has added 30 seats to the course,” said LU engineering director RS  .
 
 LU had introduced engineering last year on its second campus. Apart from computer science’s 90 seats, it offers bachelors degree in civil, mechanical, electrical and electronics & communication engineering with 60 seats each.
 
 In the second year of engineering, LU has improved the infrastructure significantly, said Gupta.
 
 For the five courses, a total of 25 laboratories are under construction.
 
 While one girls’ hostel has already been made on the second campus, one each for boys and girls has been proposed in the finance committee meeting, he added.
 
 Students will also be offered facilities like e-library and a jogging track and sports facilities in the new session. Engineering students will also get an opportunity to learn additional languages. The language laboratory for students will focus on communication skills and help students understand technical jargon.
