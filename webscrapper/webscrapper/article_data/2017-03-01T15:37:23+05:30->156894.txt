 may be currently working on the ‘Ittefaq’ remake, but he has got his sights set on another Bollywood remake as well. When the actor was asked which ‘90s film’s remake he’d like to feature in, he showed interest in working on a modern-day ‘Hum’.

  
  
 The Amitabh Bachchan-starrer released in 1991, and featured a number of actors such as Govinda,  , Kimi Katkar, Shilpa Shirodkar,  , Danny Denzongpa and Kader Khan in prominent roles. ‘Hum’ went on to become a massive success at the box-office and its music topped the charts with compositions like ‘Jumma Chumma De De’ and ‘Ek Doosre Se Karte Hain Pyaar Hum’.
  
 Sidharth added that the film had the right blend of action, romance and emotions. On top of that, he would also get to jive to ‘Jumma Chumma De De’ which would be a treat for the self-proclaimed 
  fan.
