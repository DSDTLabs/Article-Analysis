KOLKATA: Calcutta   has convened a syndicate meeting on February 6 to decide on the fate of the students who failed to clear their BA and BSc (honours and general) Part I examinations. Only 43% BA students and 73% BSc candidatescleared their exams this year.

 On Tuesday afternoon, a group of students tried to barge into the campus and after being stopped, blocked College Street for some time, disrupting traffic. Some of the students even tried to climb onto the gates. The roads were cleared for traffic only after police intervened.
 
 A delegation of students later went to the main administrative building to hand over the charter of demands. Sources said of the 332 students, only 71 managed to clear the physics general paper. Similarly, 215 among 3,838 students passed in Sanskrit, 68 of 710 students passed in botany and only 75 among 835 cleared the chemistry general paper. In economics, only 72 passed among 1,114 candidates.
 
 Education minister  , however, said candidates failing to obtain 30 marks out of 100 in two papers in case of general degree students and honours graduates failing to secure only 30 marks in a general paper only shows the poor standard of education in the institutes. He also severely criticised studentsâ€™ unjustified demand to promote them to second year despite failing in the exam.
