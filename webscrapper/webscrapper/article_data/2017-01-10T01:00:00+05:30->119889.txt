 Aam Aadmi Party’s Oscar Rebello said Costa owes no apology to Goa and welcomed the “son of the soil” home. “Though Goa and Portugal share a bittersweet history, it is in the interests of our people that we as two nations invest in the dreams of our future rather than cling to the ghosts of the past,” he said tnn
