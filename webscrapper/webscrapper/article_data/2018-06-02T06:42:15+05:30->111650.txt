PANAJI: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has issued show cause notices to the operators of 31   leases which exceeded the permissible air ambient quality (AAQ) limit before mining activity came to a halt on March 15. The notice asked them to show cause as to why their bank guarantee — estimated at around Rs 9 crore — shouldn’t be forfeited. 

 The board’s notice has been issued under Section 33(A) read with Sections 25 and 26 of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and Section 31(A) read with Section 21 of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981. The mining companies have been given 15 days to reply to the notice.
 
 “The failure to reply to the notice within the stipulated time will compel the board to forfeit the bank guarantee without further notice,” said GSPCB member secretary  .
 
 The GSPCB had directed all mining companies to take measures to control air and water pollution in their vicinity. The GSPCB had told the companies to install geo-net fencing wherever feasible in the vicinity of residential areas of the villages concerned. They were also asked to tar untarred shoulders of roads from mines to junctions, to install cat-eyes and dilineation equipment along mining routes passing through villages, and to wash roads when they aren’t being used. 
 
 Other short-term measures included the regular cleaning of road shoulders and drainages on mines-to-junctions routes, hotmixing the mines’ exits and jetty exits, the continued deployment of truck-mounted, mechanised roadsweeping machines, and the repair of existing potholes.
