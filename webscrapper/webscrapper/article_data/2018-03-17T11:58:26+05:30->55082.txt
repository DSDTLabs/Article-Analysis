BHOPAL: Issues of women safety and potable water ‘crisis’ again rocked the state assembly, with the opposition on Friday seeking a reply from the BJP-ruled government on measures being taken regarding the same.

 Raising the issue of poor law and order and attacks on women and girls during the Zero Hour, former minister and   legislator from Lahar (Bhind),   attacked the ruling party. He said the state and its capital Bhopal have turned unsafe for women, if recent incidents of attack, sexual harassment and suicides were any indication.
 
 “Another rape victim committed suicide in home minister’s native district a day before. This is third such case in past five days in the state. The entire state is being ruled by rapists and criminals. I want that home minister and the government must take strict action so that girls and students remain safe,” said Govind Singh. He further said that fear has gripped the state capital after spate in crimes against women and college-going girls. “They were leaving the city due to atmosphere of fear and the government must take stringent action,” he said. Congress legislators and treasury members also seconded that strict action be taken to curb crimes against women.
 
 The members also raised the issue of water scarcity in several districts at the onset of summer. Congress legislator from Patan (Jabalpur) Nilesh Swasthi said dug-wells have dried up in several villages of his area and the water table has declined.
 
 “In my constituency, severe water crisis was reported from   block. I urge the government to provide two submersible pumps to draw water from the bore wells,” said BJP legislator from Patharia ( ), Lakhan Patel.
 
 As legislators from both the parties engaged in a verbal duel over the worsening situation ahead of summer, Speaker   said that the government would make the issue clear in the coming days.
