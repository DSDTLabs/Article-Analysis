BENGALURU: Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy’s temple-hopping continued for the fifth day in a row as he visited three mutts on Thursday. He skipped attending office in Vidhana Soudha on Day 1 as CM.

 
 Early in the day, he called on Vokkaliga seer Nanjavadhuta Swami of Gurugunda Brahmeshwara  , Ullalu, in Bengaluru and took his blessings.
 
 “Kumaraswamy has grown into a leader of national stature and I’m confident he’ll provide good governance while taking with him all sections of the society,” the seer said, while advising BJP leaders not to create hurdles for the CM.
 
 The CM later went to Adichunchanagiri Mutt in Vijayanagar and met mutt seer, Nirmalanandanatha Swami, where he received a grand welcome. The seer congratulated Kumaraswamy on becoming chief minister and expressed confidence that he’d provide a stable government.
 
 Later, Kumaraswamy flew to Tumakuru to seek blessings of centenarian   of Siddaganga Mutt. “I need your blessings to do my best for farmers and the poor of the state,” he told the seer.
 
 He returned to Bengaluru in the afternoon and remained confined to homeoffice Krishna for the rest of the day, holding talks with   leaders over the RR Nagar elections.
 
 Seer regrets HDK remarks
 
 A day after Kumaraswamy asked him to keep off politics,   of Taralabalu Shakha Mutt hit back, saying he has always been straightforward in whatever he says and does.
 
 “I am pained by your advice to shed my narrow mindedness. I don’t belong to any political party. People who know me are aware of my nature. If you don’t know, please ask your father,” the seer told Kumaraswamy in a release issued on Thursday.
 
 Later in the night, the CM said that he has respect for all the seers, including Panditaradhya, and pointed out that he had not taken anyone’s name on Wednesday. “I don’t know why he has reacted. Let him introspect. I am the servant of the people and not anyone else,” he said, adding that no seer should encourage caste-based politics.
