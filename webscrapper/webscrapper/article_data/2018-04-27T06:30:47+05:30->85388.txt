NEW DELHI:   on Thursday accused the RSS of orchestrating a “motivated PIL” in the   on B H Loya’s death while conceding the Sangh-affiliated petitioner managed to “infiltrate” its January press conference in which the party demanded an investigation into the judge’s death.

 The party alleged the PIL was filed by   worker Suraj Lolage at the instance of RSS leader Bhaiyyaji Joshi, adding that the Sangh was keen that the matter be heard in the  . To buttress its claim, Congress lawyers Kapil Sibal and Vivek Tankha played an audio conversation purportedly between RTI activist Satish Uke and petitioner Lolage. Lolage had accompanied Uke to the AICC press conference.
 
 “There are two possibilities. Either Bhaiyyaji Joshi of RSS wanted that an enquiry into judge Loya's death be conducted or wanted an outcome which ensured that the matter was closed without an enquiry. With the facts now being placed before you, it is for the people of India to decide what the motive of RSS was,” Sibal said.
 
 In a recent judgment, the SC rejected the demand for an investigation into the judge’s death while observing that PILs should not be misused to settle political scores.
 
 In apparently sarcastic remarks, Sibal said, "We do agree with the SC that many of these PILs are being filed for purely political considerations and with the hope of an intended outcome."
 
 The Congress lawyers said Lolage filed a PIL before the Nagpur bench of Bombay HC on November 27 last year following a media report that Loya died in suspicious circumstances. Sibal said all other petitions in the case were filed in 2018, more than a month later.
