 loves to scale new heights — be it on screen or off it. The TV actor recently completed a seven-day trek in the Himalayas, starting from   in Spiti to   — one of the highest passes in the mountain range at a height of 16,000 ft. With extreme altitude, four river crossings and sub-zero temperatures at night, the trek is not advisable for amateurs. However, Abhinav says, “I decided to push the limits of my endurance and put myself in a position where I truly appreciate the basics of life — sun, water and shelter. I will do something similar every year from now on.”
The actor completed the trek without taking any help from porters or adventure consultants. “The members of our group carried sleeping mats, bags, tents, stove, food and filming equipment ourselves. Each one of us was carrying around 35 kg in our backpack. The climb was arduous and moraines further slowed our pace. The temperature used to plummet to sub-zero in the evening; water would freeze and our tent would get iced, so staying outside was almost impossible beyond a few minutes. One day, it rained and the temperature dropped to -15 degrees. We had to burn horse manure to warm ourselves.”
 Abhinav’s adventure streak can be gauged by the fact that he was stuck on a mountain ledge while on a trek in Maharashtra two years ago, from where he had to be rescued by a team of professional rock climbers. “I started valuing life much more after that, and my resolve is to live each day to the fullest,” he signs off.
