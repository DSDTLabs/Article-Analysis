Jaipur: Miffed with the state government over the Special Backward Classes (SBC) quota issue, five   began indefinite hunger strike at Sikandra near Dausa on Thursday. Gujjars staged protests at Bansur in Alwar and Khusali-Darra in Sawai Madhopur districts also.

 The Rajasthan Gujjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, which has been spearheading the quota issue for a decade now, has called the community’s maha-panchayat (public meeting) at Gudla-Pahadi near Karauli on February 25 to demand 5% separate quota for SBC within the 50% limit set by the Supreme Court.
 
 “Five of our men, who reached Sikandra from different districts of the state, have begun indefinite hunger strike from today (Thursday). We have called the maha-panchayat on February 25 to decide the course of our further agitation,” said Himmat Singh, the samiti spokesperson.
 
 Those who started hunger strike at Sikandra were identified by the samiti as Devraj Gurjar (Dausa), Birbal Gurjar (Sikar), Satish Gurjar (Kotputli), Sanjay Gurjar (Jhunjhunu) and Nanda Gurjar (Alwar).
 
 The samiti leaders, including Kirori Singh Bainsla, boycotted a meeting with the cabinet sub-committee here on Wednesday and accused the state government of backtracking on its assurances, which included granting appointment letters to SBC candidates selected against nearly 4000 posts in different departments. The government was in fix on the issue as the Rajasthan high court struck down the SBC quota, while the Supreme Court accepted the state’s appeal against the judgment but did not stay it. The Gujjars and four communities, which come under the SBC category, thus currently stand deprived of all quota benefits that were available to them earlier.
