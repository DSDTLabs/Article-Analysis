 "It's really hot here, an absolute furnace at the Chinnaswamy. It's for the second time this wicket is being used in this IPL. Looks a lot drier and cracks have started to open up. In 2016, almost 200 was an average score but last year it was a lot less, around 140-150. Think toss is going to be make a huge difference. Whoever wins the toss must look to bat first and set a big score for the opposition and hope the sun plays its role." -
