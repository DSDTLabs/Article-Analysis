 and  , who were seen together early this year when she accompanied him to Venice for the world   of his   film 'Victoria & Abdul', will now take their camaraderie on the big screen. The real-life couple have been roped in for a rom-com that will be directed by an LA-based filmmaker. Buzz is that discussions were on for a while now and the project was finalised last week when the two were holidaying in Switzerland.

 The two Ali have shared screen space in films like 'Fukrey' and ' ' and this will be the first time that they will be paired opposite each other. A source told a site that Richa and Ali met the filmmaker in Geneva last week and they finalised all the details for the same. This is an indie project, set in India and the US, and is a romantic-dramedy. The source added that the shooting for it (the film is yet to be titled), will start in September.
 
 It's a co-incidence that last year in September the actors, who began dating during the making of 'Fukrey' went public with their relationship. They then also went on several holidays together and have been sharing lovey-dovey pictures of themselves on social media.
 
 We'll have to wait and see how their romance on the big screen turns out.
