Laali’s wedding is gonna be like no other. Set in a palace in Baroda, this royal shaadi has style, splendour, romance and some quirky baraatis, who will tickle your funny bone. The trailer of writer-director Manish Harishankar’s 'Laali Ki Shaadi Mein Laaddoo Deewana', which stars Vivaan Shah,   Haasan, Gurmeet Choudhary and Kavitta Verma, will be out today. 

 While the teaser poster showed Akshara in bridal wear, clutching a piece of tamarind with a mischievous expression on her face — hinting at the possibility of premarital pregnancy — the trailer shows two brides and two grooms hilariously trapped in their own problems. The film, which has emotions and comedy in equal measure, follows the journey of its titular characters.
