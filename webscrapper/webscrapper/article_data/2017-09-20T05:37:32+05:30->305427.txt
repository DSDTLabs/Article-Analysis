GURUGRAM: The agency appointed as consultant for takeover of maintenance in builder areas by MCG has submitted a detailed project report ( ) of DLF-3 on Wednesday. The cost of revamping the entire infrastructure has been estimated at around Rs 56.92 crore.

 According to the report, the cost of building the missing infrastructure has been estimated at Rs 28.55 crore, while that of enhancing the existing infrastructure is Rs 28.37 crore. Rs 7.5 crore has been estimated for repairing roads, and an additional Rs 10 crore has been estimated for building additional road infrastructure. Along with operation and maintenance charges, the total cost for road works will be around Rs 18.85 crore.
 
 According to a MCG official, the developer will now have to do away with all the deficiencies mentioned in the DPR within the next six months, well before MCG takes over.
 
 “Either the developer fulfils all deficiencies, or it pays the corporation the required amount, so that the deficiencies can be covered up by the corporation, and additional infrastructure can be developed,” said the official. 
 
 The DPR report has already been uploaded on the MCG website. Both residents and the developer can access the report and voice their concerns, if any, to MCG officials, within the next 15 days.
 
 By law, DPR reports have to be prepared and submitted before MCG can initiate the takeover process.
 
 So far, DPRs have been submitted for Palam Vihar, Sushant Lok 1, Suncity,   1, DLF 2 and DLF 3. 
 
 The consulting agency which has been appointed by MCG and given the responsibility of preparing the DPR, is likely to complete and submit DPRs for other townships, such as Ardee City and   1 and 2, in the coming days.
