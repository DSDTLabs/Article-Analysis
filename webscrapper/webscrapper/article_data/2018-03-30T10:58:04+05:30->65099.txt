PUNE: The canal committee meeting failed to resolve the long-pending issue of a rehabilitation package for the people affected by the   project.

 District guardian minister  , minister of state for water resources   and local MLAs held discussions, but the talks ended without any concrete outcome.
 
 “The Bhama Askhed rehabilitation issue has become complicated. But we are working to find a solution. A separate meeting will be held with the local MLAs and officials to discuss the packages and rehabilitation options. Farmers will get a good package,” Bapat assured. He added the government would not hesitate to spend additional funds. Even Pune and   corporations, which are going to benefit from the project, would come out with additional allocations, he said.
 
 Local MLA   said farmers just want a respectable  .
