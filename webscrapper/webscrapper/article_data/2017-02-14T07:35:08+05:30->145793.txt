HYDERABAD: In a big boost to the long-pending elevated  , the   , extending from   in   to Ramagundam in   via Karimnagar, is likely to be upgraded to a national highway .

 The elevated-cum-ground level expressway project, which has been pending since a decade, was supposed to ease the traffic congestion between Patny and the Outer Ring Road (ORR) near Shamirpet. Currently , it takes more than an hour during peak traffic to travel on this 20 km stretch. The access-controlled expressway is expected to cut travel time short to 30 minutes.
 
 The stretch from the ORR near Shamirpet to Ramagundam has already been developed into a four-lane highway with service roads.
 
 The expressway , which is to be partly elevated and partly on the ground, has been pending for long as it requires acquisition of over 60 acres defence land. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has taken special interest and spoken to defence minister Manohar Parrikar to speed up the process.
 
 Sources said that roads and buildings minister Tummala Nageswara Rao also met Union road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari. He later told state officials that the Rajiv Rahadari is likely to be upgraded as a national highway . On the minister's directions, officials of the roads and buildings department are now preparing a detailed plan and estimates to submitted to the Centre.
 
 According to officials, if the state highway gets upgraded into a national one, the entire funding for the expressway project would be borne by the Centre. The state government will only need to allot land at an alternative place to the defence authorities, thus making it relatively easy to execute the project.
 
 “Once the state government submits details of the exact extent of land belonging to the army , air force, defence estates and Secunderabad Cantonment, we will send the proposal to the defence ministry ,“ Secunderabad Cantonment Board chief executive officer SVR Chandra Sekhar said.
