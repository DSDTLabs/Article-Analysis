 Though the farm owner   informed the forest department in the night, the cub could not be brought out alive. Sources said that the forest team did not got the necessary equipment to rescue the cub. They got the ropes and cot from the village and brought it out after nearly five hours. But it was too late by then. 
 
 Earlier, on March 11, a one-and-a-half-year-old lion cub was rescued from a well after a four-hour-long operation in  . Agariya is just about a km away from Adsang. A day before this lion cub was rescued, a lioness and a wild boar had fallen into a farm well in Vijayanagar village, some 10 km from   town. Both the animals were rescued and surprisingly, the lioness did not attack the boar which it was chasing before both fell into the well.
