KOLKATA: Construction of the much-awaited southern diaphragm wall of East-West Metro’s proposed is complete.

 Afcons-Transtonnelstroy, building the tunnels and stations from   to Esplanade including the under-river Metro corridor till Sector V, completed the ninth panel (final one) of the southern diaphragm — 17m underneath the Laldighi area of BBD Bag, around midnight on Tuesday.
 
 The diaphragms are necessary to integrate the station with the tunnels which are being dug by two boring machines. “Finally, the southern diaphragm is ready for the tunnel boring machines (TBMs) stuck below Laldighi to break through,” a senior Afcons official said on Wednesday.
 
 The first TBM, Prerna, constructing the west-bound tunnel will punch through the diaphragm in a few days. Sibling TBM Rachna will do a ditto and cut through in another 10 days.
 
 
  
 Among the several diaphragms built as the TBMs snaked through Howrah Maidan and the Mahakaran site, this one has been the most tedious one for Afcons and   (KMRC), executing the Rs 8,996 crore   project.
 
 “Having built the ninth panel, we want to give it some time as the entire wall is not firm enough yet,” a KMRC official said.
 
 The TBMs will grind through the 1m concrete wall, abarrier in the station’s southern wall, built of steel and reinforced concrete. It has two rounded areas called ‘soft eyes’ where steel rods are replaced by glass fibre reinforced polymers. Prerna will punch through the spot soon.
