NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday told the   that it was examining diplomatic options to deal with the   issue and denied allegations that refugees were being deprived of educational and medical facilities in the country.

 Appearing before a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud, additional solicitor general   said the Centre is alive to the looming crisis and taking all necessary steps to deal with it. 
 
 He, however, said the government could not reveal the steps taken by it on the diplomatic front to handle the situation arising out of influx of refugees. “These are diplomatic issues and the diplomatic solutions being worked out are not for public consumption,” Mehta said while questioning the NGOs and individuals which were insisting that the Centre allow flow of refugees into the country without checking their travel documents.
 
 He said all people residing in the country were getting access to education and health services irrespective of their status —whether they were citizens —and the same principle was applied to Rohingya refugees as well.
 
 “Whose interest are they protecting? Who wants to harm internal security of the country? National interest is paramount and it cannot be compromised. All people residing in the country are given the educational and medical services. The government is concerned about health and safety of all people living in the country,” the   contended.
 
 He opposed the plea of the petitioners who insisted the court pass interim order and said there was no such need as the government itself had assured the court that basic needs of the refugees would be taken care of.
 
 It, however, asked the Centre to file a “comprehensive” status report after visiting the sites. The hearing will now be on April 9.
