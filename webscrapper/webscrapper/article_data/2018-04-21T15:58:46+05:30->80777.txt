Singer   is ecstatic. “I am the first vocalist to be singing on a foreign land for the Indian PM,” she states.   was recently invited to   to sing at an event organised to welcome Prime Minister  . 

 
  
 
 “It was an emotional experience for me,” says an excited Shweta, adding, “This type of an event — singing for the Indian diaspora, abroad, was a first for me.”
 Shweta was moved when she saw the video of her performance, later. 
 
 She says, “When I was on stage performing, I could not gauge the audience reaction, but the video showed me that the audience was moved to tears when I was singing the song. That was overwhelming for me, so many people were touched by my rendition of the song.”
 
 The event was a huge because this was the third time in the last 60 years that an Indian prime minister had visited Sweden. “The PM and I had a brief chat after his speech was over. It was really great to meet him. I spoke to him about my music. What really meant a lot was that he said he loved my rendition of the song, 'Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon'.
