HYDERABAD: It's not just   that the state government is trying to throttle. Authorities in Mahbubnagar are going the extra mile to crack down on   too, rescuing as many as 400 children who had been sold as child brides or were being sexually abused last year. 

 The   have launched a 'Save child brides' campaign as part of its efforts. "I knew that child marriages were taking place, but was shocked to see one underway opposite a police station. We stopped it and have been able to prevent 30 such marriages since," said Rema Rajeshwari, superintendent of police, Mahbubnagar.
 
 Over the years, the district has turned into a hub of this social evil due to the livelihood conditions prevailing there. Primarily dependent on agriculture, the rural populace migrates to Hyderabad or Mumbai every year in search of jobs, leaving their children in the care of grandparents or relatives.
 
 "It is this absence of parental supervision, coupled with the need to make ends meet, that forces children into the workforce," said Rajeshwari. Some families also make haste in marrying off or selling girls to cope with destitution.
 
 Police have now launched various child protection initiatives to curb the menace.
 
  "We've launched the Balyaniki Raksha initiative with the aim of promoting child safety through collaborative policing," Mahbubnagar SP Rajeshwari said. In fact, cops received 3,647 distress calls last year and successfully intervened in dozens of cases.
 
 For instance, seven-year-old Chenchu Kathika was rescued after ragpickers spotted her at a dhaba in Bageeratha Colony. "I was leading a pathetic life. I hope I will go to school with my brother now," she said.
 
 Like her, hundreds of children can be found working at numerous tea stalls and dhabas dotting National Highway 164 and   20 and 23 that passes through the district. With no access to formal education, these children are exposed to exploitation and forced to work for a pittance.
