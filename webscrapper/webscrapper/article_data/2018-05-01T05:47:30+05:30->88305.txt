NEW DELHI: Coinciding with the anniversary of India’s first War of Independence on May 10, 1857, farmers from across the country will submit signed representations to district magistrates across India, demanding that the Lok Sabha Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairman take up two private members’ bills, one each for putting an end to farm indebtedness, and for guaranteeing remunerative minimum support prices for all agricultural products.

 
 Also on Monday the  , an umbrella body of 110 farmers’ organisations, announced their decision to stop the supply of farm products, including vegetables, grains and milk, to cities for 10 days from June 1 to protest against the Modi government and its “anti-farmer policies”. Former   leader   was among those who backed the movement. 
 
 The private members’ bills are the result of an   (AIKSCC) initiative in which over 190 farm organisations travelled across India to identify the key demands of the farmer community. The AIKSCC initiative has since found the backing of 21 political parties, and will now be introduced in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the form of private members’ bills by Raju Shetti in Lok Sabha and K K Ragesh in the Upper House, with a demand that Parliament legislate on the issues.
