LUCKNOW: Irked by the inability of the police force to check outbreak of communal violence even during Republic Day high alert,   government on Monday issued marching orders to   SP Sunil Kumar Singh and shunted him to Meerut police training school, considered an insignificant posting.

 Singh, a 2009 batch offcier, it is believed, did not alert senior officials about the gravity of the situation immediately after the incident. In fact, the initial reports that were sent to DGP headquarters on January 26 when   broke out suggested that a woman had been killed.
 
 Sources said that Singh also tried to underplay the incident. “Riots and   continued for next 48 hours which shows that preventive action had not been taken,” said an officer.
 
 While transfers of IPS officials are due in Uttar Pradesh in the next few days, the state home department on Monday dealt with crisis-hit Kasganj in what is being seen as a disciplinary action against the district police chief.
 
 The government has brought 2005-batch IPS officer   as Kasganj SP. He was posted as SP Meerut police training school.
