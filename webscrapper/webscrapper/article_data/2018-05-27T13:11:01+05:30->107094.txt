 “Sandeep Singh has given many golden moments to Indian hockey. And not just his skills, but his comeback to hockey after a life-threatening incident (an accidental gunshot had left Sandeep paralysed and on wheelchair for nearly two years) is what makes the lanky defender’s story inspiring for all of us. We hold him in high esteem and we are excited to have his wax figure at our museum,” said Anoop Srivastava, founder-director of the museum.
 
  
  
 
 The sculpting team of the museum travelled to Delhi to meet the player for measurements and other details. “Sandeep’s statue will be unveiled in July,” said Anoop.
 
 When we contacted him, an excited Sandeep told us, “I think I am the first hockey player in India to have a wax statue of his own. It is a great honour. I still remember the time when I visited the wax museum in London. While there were statues of many sports personalities, including that of Sachin Tendulkar, I didn’t see a wax figure of any hockey player. I was a little disappointed at that time and I hoped that one day, at least in India, someone would make a wax statue of a hockey player. It’s definitely a very overwhelming feeling and I am really looking forward to the official unveiling of the wax figure,” he said.
