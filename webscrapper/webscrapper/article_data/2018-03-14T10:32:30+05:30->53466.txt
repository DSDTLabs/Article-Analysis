BHOPAL: Preparations for the eighth Theatre Olympics are going on in full swing at   and  . The two venues were abuzz with activity as workers flitted in and out to decorate the venues for the grand festival, which will commence on Wednesday. 

 While the flags, banners and flexes are being put up as usual,   hired carpenters to make the props for the sets to be used during the dramas. 
 
 Puneet Trivedi, coordinator from NSD, who is looking after the technical aspects of the event, said, "The sets for most of the plays are being crafted here. Two teams of carpenters, painters and electricians are working in Ravindra Bhavan and Bharat Bhavan to make the properties required for the sets."He added that the designs and requirements for each drama were made available to him a month in advance. 
 
 "We have been planning this for a month now and the carpenters started working on the designs from Monday. Props for 13 plays are being made here while the other team in Bharat Bhavan will look after the props of 11 plays," he added.
 
 Satyavrat Rout, director of the first play 'Tumhara Vincent' said that 19th century props have been designed for his play. "The set can add to or take away the sheen of drama and though the carpenters may not realize what they are making, the director and producer who visualize the whole concept know what they have asked the carpenters to make. Along with the technicians, the directors also have to supervise their work," he said. 
 
 Ravindra Bhavan that was closed for the last seven months was opened for the event after the sound and light system was checked. 
 
 Rahul Rastogi, director,   and nodal officer for the event said, "We conducted a small programme on March 11 to see if the sound and light system were working fine. Technicians from NSD have also approved of the acoustics and the hall is ready."
 
 Arrangements for lodging artistes have been made at various city hotels.
