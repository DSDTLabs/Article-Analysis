PATNA: Though an ally in the Nitish Kumar-led grand alliance government, the   has ridiculed the idea of projecting anyone as the PM candidate of all secular and socialist forces for the 2019 parliamentary election.

 A day after JD (U) spokesperson Bharti Mehta told TOI that the JD (U) president was one of the most progressive and visionary statesmen and, as such, the non-BJP parties should contest the 2019 polls under his leadership, RJD’s national vice-president   on Wednesday quipped, “If you project someone as the PM candidate whose party has just two members in the Lok Sabha, will the parties having ten or more MPs come under your front?”
 
 Singh, however, did not name either Nitish or the JD (U), which has two members in the Lok Sabha.
 
 Addressing a press conference at the state   HQ, Singh said let the non-BJP parties first agree on a common agenda and form a united front. “The leadership issue can be and should be decided later -- by the front, not one constituent,” he said.
 
 The former Union minister feared that if all the non-BJP parties projected their president as the PM candidate, a united front would never be formed and the   might get a walkover again in 2019.
 
 Singh, known for his diatribes against Nitish, also disputed the government’s claim on the success of prohibition. “People have informed me that liquor has been successfully banned for the poor, but there is a system of ‘home delivery’ for the rich who can afford paying a premium for their booze,” said Singh when asked about one year of prohibition in Bihar.
 
 He said liquor consignments were being seized by police across the state almost every day. “If it’s an effective ban, where from these consignments are coming?” he asked. 
 
 Assailing PM   for not doing any “kaam ki baat” in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the RJD functionary demanded opening of at least five AIIMS-like hospitals in Bihar in view of its population.
