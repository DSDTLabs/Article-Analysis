SURAT/BHARUCH: The   ( ) is planning to set up a   in Bharuch to help the industries get usable water for industries in Dahej, Vilayat and Saykha estates in the Petrochemicals & Petroleum Investment Region (PCPIR) in Bharuch. 

 GIDC vice-chairman and managing director D Thara, who was on a visit to Saykha and Dahej on Friday, appraised members of Dahej and Vilayat Industries Association about the water crisis scenario. 
 
 “GIDC is planning to set up desalination plant with a capacity of 50 million litre per day (MLD) to meet the gap of water during high tide in river Narmada. Due to high tide, GIDC is forced to close all the pumping stations as total dissolved solid (TDS) and salt level increases substantially, rendering the water unfit for use in industrial processes. The five days stoppage of pumping of water impacts bigger industries, who have to curtail production,” Thara said.
 
 The proposed project will help to meet the interim water requirement of a region. The estimated cost of desalination plant will be Rs 500 crore approximately. 
 
 A Tamil Nadu-based consultant has been appointed to carry out the techno-commercial feasibility for the project. Once the final decision is taken, the plant operation will begin in 12 to 15 months, she said.
 
 Thara also asked industries to set up water recharge system to harvest rain water through percolating wells to recharge groundwater of a region. Each small, medium or large industries should take up this task as a responsible industry of the society. She also advised conducting a survey of around 10-12 villages to utilize storm water for industrial or horticulture use. 
 
 Around 400 units in Dahej and Vilayat, especially the big ones like ONGC Petro Additions Ltd (OPAL), Reliance, GACL, GFL, Dahej SEZ units, Grasim Industries, are worst affected this year since January due to low water flow in river Narmada and salinity ingress that has reached in the water sources at Nandh and Angareshwar pumping stations.
