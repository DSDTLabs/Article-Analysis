 In the span of a year, the crime branch claimed major breakthroughs like arresting hardcore interstate gangs, drug cartels, land mafias and organised gangs which dupe people on pretext of fake jobs. Kaumr added that police have also sent a proposal to state government for the implementation of state of the art technology called ‘automatic fingerprint identification system’ or AFIS.

 Crime branch is also imparting training to its officials in dealing with cases like bank fraud, cheating and organised crime. “The crime branch started ‘operation ice’ under which we nabbed several accused for smuggling drugs, an operation against illegal liquor is already underway,” Kaumr told TOI.
