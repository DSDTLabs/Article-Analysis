PANAJI: If the government doesn’t resolve the   issue, the GFP will rethink its support to the   for the Lok Sabha elections, GFP president and TCP minister   Sardesai said. 

 Bringing in an ordinance to restart mining is the only solution to the issue, he told reporters on Thursday. 
 
 Referring to the Supreme Court judgment on mining as “injustice to Goans”, he said, “An ordinance is basically to circumvent the decision of the judiciary because that decision affects the larger section of Goans.”
 
 The subject of mining in the state is different from that in the country. “Our problems and our identity is unique. Our mining problem is also unique. There is no use of auctioning leases if mining doesn’t benefit locals,” Sardesai said. The government needs to take a clear stand on this, he said. 
 
 Asked about GFP’s options, Sardesai said the options are always open. “When you’re an independent party, no option is ever closed. We are the ones who start the options. The alliance begins with us.” Sardesai said.
