CHENNAI: Before availing an   from a bank, it would be advisable to brush up on the exact rules as even bank managers might not be aware of them, say activists.

 For instance, banks cannot demand a guarantee or collateral security for education loans up to Rs 7.5 lakh if the loans are availed under the   (IBA) model educational loan scheme. Only the signature of the parent is necessary, government rules state. This is in effect since 2015, when the   was launched.
 
 “Many bank branches demand guarantee and collateral security for loans more than Rs 4 lakh even today, which is not a correct practice,“ said K Srini vasan, convenor of   (ELTF), which helps students with loan-related issues.
 
 Candidates should ensure certain basic minimum requirements before applying. For instance, the admission should be to a higher education course with a merit-based selection process or entrance test, and the college should be recognised by authorities like   or other statutory government agencies.
 
 Students whose parents' gross annual income is less than Rs 4.5 lakh can get an inter est subsidy on their loan for a period of their study period plus one more year under the IBA scheme.
 
 Rules also state that students can get a moratorium for repayment for a year after completion of their studies.There is also a provision to take two or three more moratoriums in case of unemployment or under-employment. The repayment period is 15 years and the EMI can be telescopic in nature -which increases towards the end of the loan period.
