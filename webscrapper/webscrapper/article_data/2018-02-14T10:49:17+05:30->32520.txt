SURAT: After year-long follow-up to start the high-end   between  , which was announced by the then   in February 2017, the Railway Board has categorically stated that there was no plan for it. 

 In a reply to a member of Surat Railway Station Development Citizen Forum (SRSDCF), Rajesh Modi, the Railway Board has said there was a proposal to start only three Tejas trains — New Delhi-Chandigarh, Lucknow-Anand Vihar and Mumbai Central-Karmali. 
 
 Prabhu had announced Tejas train between Surat and Mumbai last year. Three months down the line, the first Tejas train was made operational between Mumbai and Goa. 
 
 A feasibility study by Western Railway (WR) stated that Tejas train between Surat and Mumbai was not economically viable.
 
 Modi said, “This has probably happened for the first time that a railway minister announces a train in a public function, but once he is transferred to other ministry, the Railway Board is in no mood to discuss the issue. I had submitted RTI applications in this regard on two occasions, but the Railway Board denied plan for running any such train between Ahmedabad and Surat. Recently, Western Railway officially tweeted that the train will start soon, but it was learnt from the general manager that it was a wrong tweet by an overenthusiastic staff. The tweet was deleted and the employee concerned given notice.”
