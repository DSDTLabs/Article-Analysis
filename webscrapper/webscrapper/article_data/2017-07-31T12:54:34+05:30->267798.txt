 Karna managed great speed in his Polo but could not match Gillâ€™s pyrotechnics. He, however, stayed ahead of the pack in the INRC 2 category. Rahul Kanthraj and Vivek Bhatt who finished overall fifth took the second position, cruising 3 seconds later.
 
 Dean Mascarenhas and Shruptha Padival claimed the round 1 honour in INRC 3, finishing fifth in the INRC pecking order.
