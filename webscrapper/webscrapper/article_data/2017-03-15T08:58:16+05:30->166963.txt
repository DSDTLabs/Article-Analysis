HYDERABAD: Film actor and   leader   on Tuesday announced that his party would contest the elections in 2019 in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

 Addressing the media here on the third anniversary of the formation of Jana Sena, Pawan Kalyan clarified that his party was not a constituent of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). He, however, said that the Jana Sena would decide on a political tie-up before the elections. “First, we will build the party and then decide on alliances with other political parties,” he said.
 
 The actor said he would contest polls from the backward Anantapur district. Pawan had promised to contest from Anantapur district last year with a view to developing it. He said he intends to keep his word.
 
 The actor said he would launch a programme in June to strengthen the Jana Sena in AP and Telangana. “The party will go to people with a 32-point agenda.” He also launched the Jana Sena website and said he would give priority to youth in the party.
