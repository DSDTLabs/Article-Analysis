PATNA: Campaigning for Sunday’s   to three seats – Araria Lok Sabha constituency and   and Jehanabad assembly constituencies – ended on Friday. The results will be declared on March 14, a day after former   president Sonia Gandhi’s dinner meeting with opposition parties from across the country in New Delhi. 

 The byelections to three seats in the state have already acquired high stake value for the four major parties –BJP, JD (U), RJD and the Congress.
 
 The byelection in Araria was necessitated following the death of sitting RJD MP Mohammad Taslimuddin last year. The RJD has fielded Taslimuddin’s son Sarfaraz Alam, who quit JD (U) to contest the seat on RJD ticket. The BJP has fielded Pradip Kumar Singh, who lost the seat to Taslimuddin in 2014 by over 1.46 lakh votes.
 
 In Bhabhua assembly seat, BJP has fielded Rinki Pandey, widow of sitting BJP MLA   whose death necessitated the bypolls. Pandey is locked in a direct fight with   of Congress. The Bahujan Samaj Party and the CPI, which together won the seat thrice in the past, have not fielded their candidates this time to ensure Congress’s victory. 
 
 The JD (U), which was initially reluctant to field its candidates in any of the three seats, changed its stand at the last moment following BJP’s request. Abhiram Sharma of JD (U) is pitched against Sujay Yadav of RJD in Jehanabad assembly seat. Sujay is the son of former minister from RJD  .
 
 CM Nitish Kumar, his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi and RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha have campaigned extensively for NDA candidates in the three constituencies. RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav spearheaded the campaign for his party’s nominees. Several Congress MLAs, on the other hand, campaigned for the party candidate in Bhabhua.
