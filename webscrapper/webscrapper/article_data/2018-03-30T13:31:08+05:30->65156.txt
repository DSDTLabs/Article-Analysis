We have all been there, when we are too lazy to remove our make-up. From attending late-night weddings to a long day at work, removing make-up seems like a tedious job at night. But, do you know that this habit can take a toll on your skin? Missing that one step at night is one beauty sin a girl should never commit. Don’t agree? Read through and know all the things that can happen when you don’t remove your make-up regularly.

 
 
 
 Getting that eye make-up right is an achievement for every girl. But, do you know that those hot smokey eyes or those colourful shadows can cause an eye infection? From mascara to shadows, the tiny particles can slip into your eyes and cause irritation, redness and even a severe infection.
 
 
 
 No one is a fan of those hideous blackheads on the face! When you don’t remove make-up, you’re only clogging your pores, leading to blackheads. 
 
 
 
 One of the most obvious thing that can happen when you don’t remove make-up is acne. Clogged pores and not removing make-up can cause infection and lead to pimples.
 
 
 
 Removing that long-lasting lip colour is a task, we know. But is it worth getting dry lips? No way. When you don’t remove your lipstick at night, your lips can become dry as the colour leaches the moisture away from them.
 
 
 
 
 It’s always better to take care of your skin at an early stage than going for treatments later on. Not removing your make-up, creates a barrier leading to dry skin. Also, the make-up attracts free radicals which can cause early signs of ageing.
