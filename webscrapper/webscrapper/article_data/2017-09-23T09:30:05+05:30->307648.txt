VARANASI: A 45-year-old retired international chess player  's fight against the construction of a 2-km bridge over the   in Prime Minister  's constituency Varanasi on Friday divided people between the engineering marvel's ill design and euphoria over the reduced traffic chaos.

 The bridge was thrown open to public after PM inaugurated it in Varanasi on Friday.
 
 The bridge connects Ramnagar which houses the iconic fort and Saamne Ghat.
 
 The chess player, who has been seeking to protect his house, had three months ago forced the Uttar Pradesh public works department (PWD) to shorten the bridge by 44 metres after he approached the Allahabad high court.
 
 His father and three more families had moved the Allahabad high court in 2014 against the construction after his house was damaged by the PWD authorities.
 
 While the court which granted stay on the extension, Pandey family sought that PWD also pay the compensation for the land it wanted to acquire to finish the bridge. “The PWD razed our houses. Where will go? This is Modi Ji's seat. We love him for the work he has done here but we also love our families. We are not opposing the bridge or development work. My fight is only for the rightful compensation,“ said Pandey The PWD are now in a piquant situation as the bridge has to be ended abruptly due to the stay on construction of extra 44 metres road.
 
 Besides, they are also contesting the compensation demand by the Pandey and other families. The PWD, in its last hearing before the high court, said that it can only pay the compensation for the damaged house not for the land under the revenue act of the UP government.
