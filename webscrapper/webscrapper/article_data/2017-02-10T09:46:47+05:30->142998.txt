 On the fateful day, what triggered Qureshi's wrath was Singh's decision to divert the MLA's cavalcade, led by a white jeep, from the route of a procession. The ugly memories haven't faded from Singh's mind.
 
 “The jeep had no registration plate. It had four hooters which were blowing shrilly ,“ he recalled.
 
 Qureshi was not in the car which Singh stopped. After an argument, the driver called up Qureshi who then allegedly assaulted Singh.
 
 “There were protests across town but the police did not even lodge an FIR against the MLA,“ Singh said, adding that there were efforts instead to persuade Singh to agree to a compromise.
 
 “All I want is justice. Ye koi jaati ki dushmani nahi hai, ye niti ki ladai hai (This is not a battle of castes but one of ideology). If an MLA doesn't care for his own people, he doesn't deserve to come to power,“ said Singh.
 
 He added, “Qureshi and his men manhandled other police and administration officers, too.“ Singh avows to stand against Qureshi each time he contests an election. He filed his nomination from Sardhana in 2012 but it was cancelled. Qureshi had then contested on an RLD ticket but lost.

 In February 2006, Qureshi, who has studied till IX, had hit headlines when he announced a reward of Rs 51crore for anyone who would behead a Danish cartoonist for making a caricature of Prophet Mohammed.
