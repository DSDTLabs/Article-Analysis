DHARWAD: Despite assertion by senior leader and former minister   that he would not raise a banner of revolt against   for denying him a ticket to contest from the   constituency, his supporters continued to stage demonstrations. 

 On Thursday, the supporters including women blocked the road near Alur Venkatrao Circle for some time and vented their anger by setting tyres on fire. They also raised slogans against district in-charge minister   and accused him of sabotaging Morey's chances. The protestors urged the Congress high command to reconsider its decision and field Morey. Members of the Maratha community to which   belongs had protested on Tuesday.
 
 Three-term  , who was a minister in the Bangarappa and   cabinets, was an aspirant for the Congress ticket again. The Congress has fielded Ismail Tamatgar, who joined the party after he lost twice as a JD(S) candidate.
 
  On Wednesday evening, Morey held a meeting with his supporters and tried to placate them, saying that the party will not change the candidate at this stage. Morey did not mince words when he expressed his disappointment at being neglected. Though he said that he would not quit the party, he accused Vinay Kulkarni of sabotaging his chances. He said the all was not well in the Congress and the party was going off the track. "The bedbugs have entered the party and we need to eliminate them, instead of us quitting the party" he said without specifying whom he targeted.
