Nagpur: As many as ten ayurveda doctors from the city, including three couples, were booked by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) for cheating investors to the tune of over Rs93.21 lakh.

 Following complaint by 12 investors, the police arrested five of the accused on Tuesday. The accused has started QNET Vihaan Direct Selling Pvt. Ltd. Company in 2015 and operated the firm from Bengaluru. They promised investors to give them Rs5 crore in five years.
 
 The cops said the accused lured the investors to give them 10% commission along with luxurious gifts and concessions over travel packages at international tourist places, grand hotels etc. To earn money, the investors had to add their friends and relatives to put in money so that the chain in multi-level marketing is increased.
 
 The arrested accused have been identified as Kavita Khond, Prashant Dakhode and his wife Pradnya, Prashant Dharmik and his wife Mrunal. All the accused will be produced before the court on Wednesday.
 
 The fraudsters who were yet to be nabbed are Ashish Lunavat, Kishor  , Shrikant Ramteke, Mangesh Chikare and his wife Rutuja.
 
 Senior PI Mukhtar Sheikh told TOI, “Lunavat and Bhandarkar were inventors of the scheme which they launched through a portal so that the investors could approach them easily. They generated e-cards and email ID of the company which they provided to investors to give it a professional look. However, the investors were not able to see the profits as the system was controlled only by the accused.”
 
 When entrepreneur Achal Lal, a resident of Swavlambi Nagar, didn’t get the returns, she smelt something fishy. Accordingly, she approached EOW and lodged a complaint. Sheikh said the number of complainants could rise further.
