CHANDIGARH: A district consumer disputes redressel forum has directed   in Sector 8 to pay Rs 10,000 for not adjusting the fees of its customers when it was undergoing renovation. As per a complainant, the club failed to provide the services for nearly five months.

 Complainant Prince Singh, a resident of Sector 4 Mansa Devi Complex, Panchkula, stated that he took the membership of the club from October 30, 2015 for the services that included   and spa. On June 20, 2016, the spa section, which included changing room, washroom and shower facilities was closed for two weeks for renovation. In between, the complainant received a   on September 2, 2016 informing that the gym would be closed for another 10 days. However, the renovation work got extended up to nearly five months
 
 In a written reply club authorities admitted that the complainant took the membership on October 3, 2015 and used the services without any complaint till June 2016. However, it denied that the place remained closed for five months. It also denied that the spa services were not resumed for two months.
 
 “We feel that it was the duty of the club to send messages of adjusting the days/time of renovation to all its members if they were willing to renew their membership. On the other hand, the club sent messages to its consumers apprising them of the expiry period of their old membership. The gym management was sending messages for the delay in renovation and also the fitness re-assessment of the complainant instead of sending message of adjustment of the previous fee,” the forum said
 
 Observing that the act of the club comes under unfair trade practice, it directed the gym to allow the complainant to use the facilities for free for four months and to pay Rs 5,000 as compensation and Rs 5,000 as litigation cost.
