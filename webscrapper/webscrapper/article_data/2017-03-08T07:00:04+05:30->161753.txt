RAJKOT: If you pass   at  , the popular hangout place in Rajkot on Sunday evening, you will invariably notice Gora Trivedi and her team at the circle with placards, urging people not to unnecessarily blow their horns and make peace prevail. 

 Gori Trivedi, a social activist and head of department at Shree H N Shukla College of Legal Studies in Rajkot, launched the ‘No Horn Please’ campaign, in August 2015 in Rajkot with just four members. She now has 40 members in her team.
 
 Every Sunday evening, Trivedi and other volunteers stand with placards at Jilla Panchayat Chowk for two hours and politely ask commuters not to blow their horn, which creates noise pollution.
 
 “The idea was to create awareness about basic civic sense and being a good citizen in day-to-day life. We started with the ‘No Horn, Please’ campaign. We are getting support from people and they are joining us. It is team work. Police have also joined our efforts and help us. We just want to people to keep in mind that to think before they act as it may cause pain to others, in every aspect of life,” says Trivedi, who has written a book, The Civic Code. 
 
 Her book’s first page reads, ‘My rebellion may be wrong, but my pain is genuine’. 
 
 “I urge people, especially women, to offer a few hours every week to some good work. Whatever they like. And then see the world around you. It will change your perspective on life,” she says.
