GURUGRAM: Four police personnel, including an assistant sub inspector, who had gone to arrest a criminal, were allegedly gheraoed and thrashed by   at Kadarpur, around 12km from the city, on Monday night. A reinforcement team from nearby Badshahpur police station rushed to the spot and rescued the crime unit members following a high voltage drama that continued for around 20 minutes. No serious injury was reported though.

 Though the criminal, Sanju (28), who is wanted in many cases of theft, snatching and robbery, managed to flee, the police arrested three villagers for attacking the cops and preventing them from carrying out their duty. 
 
 Acting on a tip-off, a team, led by ASI Dinesh Kumar, from Sohna crime unit had raided Sanju’s house at Kadarpur around 7.30pm on Monday. The police team had managed to nab him and recovered an illegal pistol and four cartridges from his possession. But, when they tried to take Sanju away, around 50 villagers, including family members of the criminal, attacked the police team. The villagers pelted stones and thrashed the cops, and freed Sanju. 
 
 Responding to the crime unit’s SOS, around 20 cops from Badshahpur police station rushed to the spot. By the time the reinforcement team arrived at Kadarpur, the villagers dispersed from the site. 
 
 Later, based on ASI Dinesh’s complaint, the police nabbed Pawan, younger brother of Sanju, and two villagers Bheem and Rahul. An FIR has also been registered against over 50 villagers under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (causing hurt), 332(voluntarily causing heart), 353 (assault), 186 (obstructing public servant) of the IPC.
 
 “We are questioning the three villagers and trying to identifying others, who will be arrested soon. We are also conducting raids to nab the criminal, who managed to flee with the help of the villagers,” said inspector Rajender Singh, SHO, Badshahpur police station.
 
 The   villagers will produce in a city court on Wednesday.
