GREATER NOIDA: Family members of a 12-year-old boy who has been missing for a week, protested outside Dadri police station on Tuesday alleging shoddy investigation in his mysterious disappearance and ‘murder’.

 The victim, Bhura, lived in Nai Aabadi, Dadri. Sonu, Bhura’s cousin, said he had gone to the cloth shop where he worked on September 3, but did not return in the evening.
 
 The victim’s family then filed a missing complaint with Dadri police station. On Monday, the family visited the police station to get an update, and police officers informed them a body was found from a canal on September 6, and had been cremated as it was decomposed. “The officers did not bother to inform us before performing the last rites,” Sonu said.The family said the   could be a result of two shopkeepers’ rivalry.
 
 Ram Sen Singh, SHO of Dadri police station, said medical reports suggested the body was that of someone aged around 30. Bhura’s family members claimed the swollen body may have looked older and reitrated that it was Bhura. Police have launched a fresh investigation into the matter.
