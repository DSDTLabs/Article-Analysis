GURGAON: The   grab of three youths burning down three luxury  , including a  , in Sector 15 Part-II has brought to fore the laxity of the patrolling in the area yet again. 

 The   shows a PCR van going past the trio without raising any doubts about their presence near the house so late in the night. 
 
 According to fire department officials, the cars, a BMW, a Toyota Fortuner and a Chevrolet Beat, caught fire at around 3.30am on Sunday. However, cops say that the failure to   the cars must have led to the thieves setting them ablaze. “We are investigating why the cops did not question the trio’s presence in the area,” said ACP Mahender Singh Sethi.
