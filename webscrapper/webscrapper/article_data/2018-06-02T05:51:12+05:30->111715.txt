NEW DELHI: The capital touched an all-time high in power consumption on Friday. The power demand in the afternoon was 6,652MW. The previous high was 6,526 MW on   6 last year. 

 Friday’s high was recorded at 3.36pm. The discoms said the demand has been unusually high this year. “This year, the peak power demand crossed the 6,000MW mark eight times while last year it had crossed only twice—6,021MW on May 16 and and 6,001MW on May 26, 2017. In 2016 too, the peak power demand had crossed the 6,000MW mark only twice. The fact that the power demand this time has crossed 6,600MW shows the robustness of the capital’s distribution and   system, which has been able to measure up,” said a discom representative. 
 
 The high demand shows the use of air-conditioners round the clock. At this rate, the power consumption would keep on rising and might cross the 7,000MW threshold in the coming week. 
 
 Power companies are busy with their own arrangements. Peak power demand in BRPL areas of south and  , which had reached 2,745MW during summer in 2017, is expected to cross 2,880MW this year. In   areas of east and central Delhi, the peak power demand, which had reached 1,469MW last year, is expected to touch around 1,670MW this time. In north Delhi, the peak demand on Friday was 1,850MW, 100MW more than the previous day, and   officials said they were expecting demand to surge to 1,950MW. They said they have made arrangements for 2,000MW.
 
 Going by previous years’ trends, the electricity demand normally peaks in either June or July. “July is generally worse in terms of power consumption as this is the time when room coolers are no longer effective and every household switches on air-conditioners to beat the humidity in the air,” said an official. 
 
 Delhi has been facing a long and hot summer and the government is closely monitoring the power situation to ensure that there is no gap in power availability. Industry experts, however, said any interruptions in power supply this year would not be on account of shortage of power supply but more likely due to problems in transmission and distribution network, which may not be equipped to handle such a high load.
