KOLKATA: A joint team of the   (EB) and KMC has zeroed in on firms producing packaged drinking water without a valid licence. Some of these units are selling unsafe water in bottles bearing labels of prominent brands.

 “We have come to know about the existence of few such units but some of them are located beyond KMC jurisdiction. We need to initiate a joint drive with help from state EB and municipalities concerned. Most of these factories are located either in   or Rajarhat,” said a KMC health official.
 
 
  
 In past five days, the team has raided several units producing packaged drinking water in and around Kolkata. The team, which has visited 23 units within the KMC jurisdiction, has planned a bigger operation next week when the EB is likely to seal some of the illegal units.
 
 “We won’t do anything in a hurry. But we won’t let anyone escape. The KMC and the police will take action against the offenders,” mayor   said.
 
 Atin Ghosh, mayor-in-council member overseeing the KMC health department, categorically stated that the EB will have to be more active and ensure that the bottling plants were sealed. “Once these unlicenced units are closed down, it will be easier for us to take action against owners of bottling plants who are producing packaged water with a licence but have failed quality test,” said a KMC health department official.
 
 According to the official, the civic body can lodge a lawsuit against errant owners according to a provision of Food Safety and   (FSSAI). If charges are proved, s/he can be imprisoned for six months and need to pay a maximum penalty of Rs 1lakh.
 
 DC (EB) Debasis Sarkar said they are in talks with KMC about the next course of action. “KMC has begun legal proceedings under the Food Safety and Security Act. We are looking into all legal options. We will assist KMC in very possible manner,” said Sarkar.
