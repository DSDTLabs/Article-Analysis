KOLKATA:   chief minister   on Sunday demanded a thorough probe into the   ( ) fraud case, alleging that other banks, too, were involved in the scam. 

 Claiming the Rs 11,300-crore scam involving billionaire jewellery designer   was only a fraction of a mammoth fraud committed on Indian banks, she asserted that it took place during demonetisation.
 
 “This is just the tip of the iceberg. Big money laundering happened during demonetisation. There are more banks involved. The full truth must come out,” the Bengal CM said in a tweet.
 
 Alleging that key officials were changed in some banks during demonetisation, Banerjee demanded an investigation of the people who replaced them and those involved in effecting transfers/removals. “Key bank officials were changed. Who are these people put in?” she said. 
 
 The CM has already used the Rs 11,300-crore fraud to buttress her argument against the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill that proposes a “bail in” clauses if a bank suffers heavy losses. She again wrote to   on Thursday with a request to scrap the bill. “I had written to the finance minister earlier. He didn’t respond. Later, the minister of state wrote to me saying the legislation won’t affect depositors. Now, see what’s happened in PNB,” she had said on February 15. 
 
 The comments prompted state BJP president Dilip Ghosh to launch a scathing counter-attack on Sunday. Posting several photos showing Mehul Choksi attending Bengal Business Summit on July 4, 2017, he said: “What would Didi’s comments now be? What will the so-called leaders of TMC have to say to the camaraderie evident between Amit Mitra & Mehul Choksi...?”
