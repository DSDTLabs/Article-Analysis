In the latest episode of India’s Next Superstars, we saw the theme of festivities and dance performances again . The first act was presented by Naina and Shaarik. Their performance left everyone spellbound and the judges applauded it as well. Seeing the positive response, both Shaarik and Naina were overwhelmed.

 Angela and Karan presented a rather twisted tale on murder. The judges were impressed with Karan’s portrayal of a negative character and told him to push himself more.
 
 Just like the previous episode, it was time for the guys to show off their dance moves on the stage. They were judged on their individual dancing talent.
 
 Next up, Ansh presented his act based on the life of cricketer Yuvraj Singh. Harsh and Kanika gave a performance on the theme of Karva Chauth. However, it was not liked by the judges.
 
 After all the acts, it was time for the elimination round. As per the leader-board, Praniti, Kanika, Harsh, Karan and Ahmed scored the lowest.
