AMRITSAR: Akal Takht   Giani Gurbachan Singh, in a statement issued on Monday, said that   by a drunk policeman, was a blot on men in uniforms.

 The jathedar has asked the state government to ‘rein in people like Didar Singh, an assistant sub-inspector in Government Railway Police (GRP)’, who faced   after misbehaving with a baptized Sikh woman on a PRTC bus on July 21.
 
 Giani Gurbachan Singh said the government should take exemplary action against the erring policeman, else the Akal Takht would intervene and the government would be responsible for any unpleasant consequences.
