BENGALURU: The legislature on Monday legalized  , bull runs and bullock cart races by terming them traditional sports and exempted them from the  , by amending it with a legislation.

 The bill was carefully worded, and said there should be no harm to the animals. Passed unanimously by the legislative assembly, it said: “Notwithstanding anything...conduct of `kambala' or `bulls race or bullock cart race' shall be permit ted, subject to condition that no unnecessary pain is caused to the animals, by the person in charge of that animal used to conduct `kambala' or `bulls race or bullock cart race' as the case may be and subject to such other conditions.“
 
 Animal husbandry minister A Manju sought the assistance of   members to secure quick assent from the Union home ministry , and assent from the President. “While we may have brought in the legislation, I urge you (BJP) to get the Centre's assent, considering it is your party ,“ he said.
 
 Earlier, opposition leader   said the government decision was a welcome move and the judiciary must discuss such cases at length, before arriving at any decision. BJP legislator S Suresh Kumar said the act of banning the sport was a classic case of “judicial overreach“.Cutting across party lines, Dakshina Kannada legislators said the bill to legalize the sport was required. “ As far as cruelty of animals in kambala goes, the bullocks are treated by their owners like their own children.They are fed like kings and barring some 26 days of the race, they are kept very comfortably ,“ Shakuntala Shetty (Congress) said.
 
 BJP legislator from Karkala V Sunil Kumar said people should not equate kambala with jallikattu. “While there are hundreds of cases of deaths in jallikattu, no death has been recorded in kambala, be it of the racer or animal,“ he added.
