MIDNAPORE: A 32-year-old   (WBCS)   was found dead on the terrace of the   Medical College and Hospital (MMCH) on Tuesday morning. He had allegedly gone missing from the critical care unit of the hospital a day before. 

 A resident of Hooghly's Chinsurah, Samaresh Hazra's naked body was found hanging from a water pipe on the terrace of the hospital building, suspended with a towel around his neck. Hazra had joined the Analysis Research and Training Institute in West Midnapore's Salboni as a trainee revenue officer two weeks ago. He was admitted to the critical care unit (CCU) of MMCH on January 18, after his colleagues found him unconscious in the hostel room following a tranquiliser overdose.
 
 About 6.40am on Monday, a nurse informed Hazra's family that the patient was missing. Despite submitting a written complaint to the hospital superintendent, Hazra's family wasn't allowed to search the premises. "We pleaded with hospital authorities to allow us to search every room and terrace of the hospital. But they refused to let us do so. It is surprising why the door to the terrace was not locked. Authorities told us that CCTV footage does not show my brother leaving the hospital," said Hazra's sister, Rita Biswas.
 
 Around 8.45am on Tuesday, a hospital employee went to the terrace to hang washed linen when she found Hazra's body. She immediately informed the hospital authorities, who summoned the cops. The body was then sent for autopsy. West Midnapore SP Alok Rajoria said, "Our inquiry so far points to suicide, and we're investigating how he managed to sneak out of the CCU. A magisterial probe has been ordered." Hazra's family said he suffered from depression and had attempted suicide in the past. He was also allegedly under pressure from his wife to abandon his family.
