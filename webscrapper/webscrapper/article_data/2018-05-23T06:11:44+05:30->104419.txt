AHMEDABAD: In a rare initiative, the forest department has teamed with city-based NGOs, naturalists and the   to conduct an detailed survey to estimate the populations of peafowl, monkeys, langurs and fruit bats in the city.

 The   forest department decided to conduct an informal survey in the city, which will be completed by May 31. The in-charge divisional forest officer (DFO) for Ahmedabad city, S  , said this census was first conducted in 1998, when 2,500 peafowl were found in Ahmedabad city. The second census was conducted in 2004, when their number was found to have increased.
 
  Pandit said that after 2004, no count was taken up. “Now, as I am in-charge of the city, I decided to conduct the count. As this count is not conducted regularly, it can’t be termed a formal census,” he said.
 
 The DFO, who is also the deputy conservator of forests for  , said, “The ten-day count will be conducted mainly for two hours a day, one hour beginning at 6am and another at 6pm. The department decided to send more than one team to areas like Cantonment and ATIRA, as these areas have large populations of the target species.”
 
 The department will also collect information about how much people know and whether they perceive monkeys in their backyard as a cause of concern or whether they feel harassed by them.
 
 Pandit said the department has even asked the residents to be part of the estimation process. He said, “These days people have mobile phones with high-resolution cameras. We want residents to send photographs of monkeys, fruit bats or peafowl via WhatsApp to 7600009845 or to email them to rfodascroi@gmail.com.
