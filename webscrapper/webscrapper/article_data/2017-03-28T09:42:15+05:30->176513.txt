NEW DELHI: A suspected burglar was arrested in   in the US state of   last week, after he was spotted in a rather unusual position: dangling from a fence by his pants.

 Passerby Jesse Sensibar, who was driving by the Miles Elementary School on Friday morning, saw the hapless fellow hanging from the school's iron fence and took a photo, which he later uploaded on social media. 
 
 "One more reason not to jump fences in baggy pants. I saw this homie hanging around at the Miles School this morning when I was rolling eastbound on Broadway Avenue. I was going to help him off the fence but by the time I got back around the block the cops were rolling up two cars deep," Sensibar said in his   post.
 
 
 
 
 Witnesses told the UK's Telegraph that the suspected thief had been seen trying to force some doors at the school, but was spotted by the school authorities. He made a break for it and tried to clamber over the spiked fence marking the school perimeter - but snagged his pants on the fence, and ended up hanging upside-down with his underwear exposed for the world to see.
 
 Sensibar further said that when he drove past the school again fifteen minutes later, he saw the man handcuffed in the back of a police car.
 
 "He smiled for the camera," Sensibar claimed. 
 
 One can only wonder what happened in the intervening 15 minutes - how the police managed to unhook the man, and the burglar's coflicting emotions: relief when he was freed from his embarassing sprawl, or resentment on being arrested.
