Chennai: Casual visitors wary of heavy parking fee at   and entry restrictions at SIMS Hospital, have been parking their vehicles along the narrow   behind these two landmarks, choking traffic flow on the road. The mall charges Rs 30 an hour for vehicles and Rs 60 for premium car parking, whereas the metro parking station charges Rs 20 for six hours.

 Residents have been sending representations to officials requesting them to decongest the stretch, which is a crucial link to commuters exiting Saligramam and Kumaran Colony to enter the 100ft road.
 
 “Scores of bikes, autoricksaws, cars and even vans are being parked here daily, and the number of vehicles goes up during evenings and weekends,” said  , a shopkeeper.
 
 “Even if a car and an autorickshaw come up against each other, there will be a congestion. In case of an emergency, an ambulance definitely cannot pass through this road,” said S K Rehmad, who works in an eatery on the street. As such, more than 250 families reside there. Those frequenting eateries, a park, a hostel and a church on the street park also their bikes on their vehicles on the road making things worse. 
 
 “People who park here mostly either come to the mall or the park. We have been battling this menace for three years now. Though bikers who are made to pay fine do not come back, a fresh batch of visitors always finds its way in,”   who once headed the street association. “We tow vehicles if we get calls as we have only one towing van allotted,” said an inspector C S Prakash Kumar.
