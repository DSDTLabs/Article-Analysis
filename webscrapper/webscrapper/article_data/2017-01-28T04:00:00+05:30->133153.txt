Vadodara: M S University’s syndicate body on Friday ratified the suspension of dean of Faculty of Arts who was arrested by the Jodhpur police last week in connection to the recruitment scam at Jai Narayan Vyas University (JNVU).

 It was on Wednesday that the university had issued orders of Pradeep Singh Choondawat’s suspension under ordinance 31 of MSU handbook. 
 
 Choondawat has already been removed from the deanship of the faculty apart from being relieved from all the charges that he was holding including that of Baroda Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya which have now been handed over to officiating dean professor K Krishnan. 
 
 If Choondawat gets bail and submits an application to the university requesting to revoke his suspension orders, the university will however rethink on his suspension. 
 
 Jodhpur’s anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had arrested Choondawat last Saturday for his alleged role in the JNVU recruitment scam. 
 
 Choondawat in 2012 was invited as an external expert in a selection committee for appointments at sociology department of JNVU.
 
 He was introduced to three candidates before the interviews were conducted. 
 
 Choondawat was told to ask specific questions to these candidates and select them for the post of assistant professor which he allegedly did. 
 
 The cops are yet to ascertain whether money was paid to Choondawat for selection of the three candidates who are presently absconding. 
 
 Choondawat, who is on verge of retirement, had failed to officially communicate to the university regarding the reason behind his absence. He had applied for leave between January 13 and January 19.
