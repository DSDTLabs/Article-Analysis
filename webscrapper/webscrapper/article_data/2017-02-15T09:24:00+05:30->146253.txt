MUMBAI: While hillock cutting is one of the major tasks for   to level and prepare the land for the   construction, 15%-20% of the hill mass is already gone, thanks to the stone quarrying by around 32 licensed stone and sand miners. Their   expired six months ago. 

 A few months from now, the parched paddy fields, marshy mudflats and the villages will make a way for the country’s most ambitious greenfield project worth Rs 16,000 crore. 
 
 “We have not renewed the licences of the stone miners since five to six months now and there is no quarrying happening there though over 15% of hill mass has gone,” said a senior Cidco official. He added that though the vertical cuts on the hills looked prominent, there was a huge soil mass still remaining in them which will have to be removed only through heavy blasting. “For this blasting, we need one more environment clearance the formality for which is expected in a month. After this, the contractors appointed for pre-development works such as land-filling, hill-cutting and river diversion will begin hopefully from June,” the official added.
 
 According to Cidco managing director Bhushan Gagarani, the entire project land is to be raised to 7m from the sea level to make it safe from floods and other geological, construction and aviation risks. Officials said around 5 cubic metre soil can be extracted from the  , of which 3.75 cubic metre will be enough to fill up the core 1,160 hectre area. “The remaining soil can be used for further elevation of certain areas besides for construction of roads in and around the project area,” said a technocra t involved with the project.
 
 Around 3,500 families or 10,000 people live in the 1,160 hectare core area between Panvel creek and Karnala Hills proposed to be used for the new international airport. They make up 10 villages in Panvel including Chinchpada, Owle and Kopar. Of the 2,268 hectares required for the project, 1,572 hectares are already in Cidco’s possession.
