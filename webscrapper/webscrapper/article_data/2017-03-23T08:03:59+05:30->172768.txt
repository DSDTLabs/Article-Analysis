NAINITAL: Family of Hira Ballabh Bhatt, hailing from Joelikote in Nainital, who was among the 12 Central   ( ) troopers killed in a suspected Maoist attack in insurgency-hit Sukma district of Chhattisgarh on March 11, received Rs 9 lakh from Bollywood actor   and Rs 50,000 from badminton star  . 

 "I, along with my family members, express deep gratitude to actor Akshay Kumar, Saina Nehwal and others who have been helping us financially. We never expected to receive help in such a short duration of time," said Ghanand Bhatt, brother of Hira Ballabh.
 
  Hira Ballabh was posted in Sukma when the attack took place. His body was cremated at Chitrshila ghat in Kathgodam and his mortal remains were brought to the Ropera village in Joelikote near Nainital earlier this month. The jawan is survived by his wife and two children, a 14-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter. Ghanand also said, "The government should ensure that instances such the Sukma attack are not repeated in the future so that families do not lose their sons, husbands, brothers and fathers." The family, however, is yet to get any form of help or financial aid from the state government. "We have not received any sort of assistance from the state government so far," added the brother.
