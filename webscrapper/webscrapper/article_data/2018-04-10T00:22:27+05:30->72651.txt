MUMBAI: The   newspaper, Saamna, has spurned   chief Amit Shah’s offer for an alliance for the 2019 elections. However, a key Maharashtra BJP functionary said Matoshree would extract more assembly seats from the BJP—especially in the Mumbai metropolitan region—and sign the poll agreement at the eleventh hour. 

 “The Sena is making suitable noises to strike a good bargain with us,” he pointed out. Shah, who was in Mumbai last Friday to preside over the BJP’s 38th anniversary function, later told journalists that he would want the Sena to team up with the BJP for the 2019 elections. The Sena has already announced that it would go solo in the next elections. 
 
 Against this backdrop, the Saamna editorial on Monday stated that it would not ink a poll pact with the BJP.
 
  “The BJP doesn’t need allies as it is strong and self-made. The BJP’s national president has made a fleeting comment that he wants the Sena to be his party’s poll partner. However, the BJP didn’t come up with this bright idea in 2014, and once ensconced in power, it tossed humility out of the window,” said the Sena mouthpiece.
 
 Cautioning the BJP that the poll scenario could be different in 2019, Saamna said Shah's party was still basking in the glory of 2014.
