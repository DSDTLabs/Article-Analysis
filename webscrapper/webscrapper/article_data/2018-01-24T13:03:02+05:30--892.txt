MADURAI: Taking a cue from neighbouring Kerala, Madurai city traffic police have installed a body camera at   junction in the city. The initiative has been taken up on a pilot basis and would be expanded throughout the city depending on its outcome, say police officers.

 The camera was issued to   traffic inspector   who has been using it at Goripalayam junction for the last four days.
 
  Officers said that the camera which cost Rs one lakh could record up to 8 hours continuously since it had an inbuilt storage capacity of 32 GB. This could be transferred to a computer or an external storage and viewed. 
 
 However, it does not have the feature to live-stream the footage which would have facilitated its viewing and recording at a remote location. The devices used by the police in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi does have this facility. 
 
 According to the officers, the third eye is to be specifically used during vehicular checks and traffic management.
 
  The video footage can be analysed to get an enhanced view of the issues reported during vehicular checks besides being used for improving traffic management. 
 
 A police officer said that the camera footage would come in handy to sort out arguments between police personnel and vehicular owners while booking for traffic violations. There was a standing instruction from the higher officers to make case registrations smooth by making the violators realise their mistakes. 
 
 However, arguments often break out as the vehicle owners tend to claim that they had not made any violation, he said. 
 
 “Moreover, it will also deter the police personnel from receiving bribes and striking compromises with vehicle owners,” he said.
 
  A higher official said that the performance of the device was under scrutiny. The particular model had been chosen after reviewing a few models. 
 
 More number of body cameras would be purchased with the help of the state government once they were proven to be effective.
