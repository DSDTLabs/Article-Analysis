NEW DELHI: The Enforcement Directorate has filed a chargesheet against two Delhi-based entry operators,   and  , and attached a parcel of farm land associated with them in Bhatti village in Delhi. The brothers are in judicial custody and believed to have helped many politicians convert their black money into legitimate business transactions using shell companies.

 The role of the two entry operators is also being probed in connection with farm land purchased by former Bihar CM   Prasad’s daughter. The income tax department had recently raided at least 20 places in Delhi and the NCR in this case.
 
 The agency on Thursday attached the brothers’ farm land in Bhatti village which is believed to have been bought from the commission the brothers had earned from money laundered for their high profile clients. The accused had allegedly laundered over Rs 8,000 crore in the last 15 years using dozens of shell companies floated by them during this period. The ED had earlier attached a five-star hotel in Dwarka in the Capital belonging to them worth around Rs 65 crore.
 
 The two brothers were arrested on March 20 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and a chargesheet (prosecution complaint) was filed against them before a special court on Thursday.
 
 “In view of their income from laundering through shell companies, ED has provisionally attached agricultural land, pertaining to Jain brothers, at Bhatti village in New Delhi to the extent of Rs 1.12 crore, the registered value of the property,” the agency said in a press note.
