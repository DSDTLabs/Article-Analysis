TOI takes a look at how the tournament is placed

 
 
 
 18 points 
 Currently topping the table. 
 
 They also have a good net run rate of +0.810. If they beat   today, they will finish in the top two with 20 points. Even a narrow loss to KKR and a loss for Pune in one of the two games will ensure that they qualify in the top two. 
 
 
 
 
 16 points 
 Currently placed No.2 
 
 With 16 points and a healthy net-run rate of +0.729, they are well placed to make it to the play-offs. They will want to finish in the top two though and a win against MI at the Eden today will guarantee them that. Only a loss by more than 70 runs will see them miss out on a play-off berth and that too only if   beat   and Lions beat Sunrisers. 
 
 
 16 points 
 Currently placed No.3 
 
 After the loss to Delhi, they now must hope that   lose to   today. If that happens, the result of the match against Kings XI on Sunday does not matter. Their net run rate is quite poor at -0.083. If the Sunrisers lose to Lions on Saturday, the game against Kings XI in Pune on Sunday afternoon becomes a shoot out for the play-offs.
 
 
 15 points 
 Currently placed No.4 
 
 They have to beat The Lions today. If they do that it will take them to 17 points and ensure them a play-off berth. They can finish in the top two too if MI beat KKR and Kings beat Pune.
