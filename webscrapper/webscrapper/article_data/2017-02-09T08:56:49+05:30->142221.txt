MUMBAI: The 14-year-old daughter of an Indian   engineer, who thought her 21-year-old brother was being maligned and threatened by a   employee’s family over creation of an alleged   Facebook   of her friend, jumped to death from her sixth floor residence at   on Monday morning.

 Neha (name changed), a Std IX student, had her breakfast, wore her school uniform and jumped from the window, leaving a suicide note behind. Zonal DCP Manoj Sharma said Neha told her brother to create an account in her name as she did not know how to do it. “Her brother created the account and she started operating it. A week later, an account in the name of Neha’s friend, Reema (name changed), who stayed in the vicinity, also cropped up. Reema claimed she had not created it,” he said. 
 
 Reema’s family reportedly went to Neha’s house and alleged that her brother was responsible for the fake account, which had her contact details. Reema’s family also approached the defence school and complained to the authorities about Neha’s brother. “Neha had been stating that her brother did not do it, but Reema’s family allegedly threatened him, which upset Neha,” said an officer.
 
 Neha said in the suicide note that she was traumatised seeing her brother being targeted. “We are examining the note. Statements of all concerned are being recorded,” added the officer. Reema’s father was arrested on charges of abetment of suicide. 
 
 The Cuffe Parade police are trying to find out the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer from where Reema’s account was created.
