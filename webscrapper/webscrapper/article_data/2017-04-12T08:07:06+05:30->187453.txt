NEW DELHI:Delhi State Election Commission on Tuesday issued a notice to AAP directing them to remove all their posters as it violates the model code of conduct.
The SEC's order came after leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta had complained to the state election body regarding usage of his “distorted“ pictures in AAP posters.
 
 “Criticism of other political parties, when made, shall be confined to their policies, past record and work. Parties and candidates shall refrain from criticism of all aspects of private life,“ the letter stated.
 
 SEC has given AAP 48 hours to take appropriate action and remove all such posters that defame Gupta.
 
 AAP however refused to comment on that matter. Party sources claim that any decision related to this will be taken on Wednesday .
