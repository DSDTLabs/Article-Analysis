KOLKATA: A huge cloud mass that engulfed the Kolkata sky in the afternoon broke open around 3pm, lashing the city with a thunderstorm and pulling the mercury down by 10°C on Sunday. The city also recorded a rainfall of 23.6mm in about oneand-a-half hours. Sunday’s storm claimed eight lives in three districts. Five boys died after being hit by lightning in Uluberia, two died in Ghatal and one in Jalangi. One boy from Uluberia is battling for life in the hospital with 70% burns.

 
  
 
 The rain was accompanied by a gusty wind. Some tram lines were snapped and lighting struck a three-storey residential building in Sinthee. Fortunately, no one was injured. Two passengers were injured when their auto keeled over near Gariahat. Places like   underpass, Thanthania and Ultadanga underpass went under ankle-deep water.
 
 Around 1.20pm the Met office issued a thunderstorm alert for Kolkata, Howrah and   within the next three hours. By 2pm, the city had plunged into darkness under the cover of thick clouds.
 
 “The cloud mass moved towards the city at a slow pace in the absence of very strong winds. That is why the rain lingered,” said G K Das director (weather) at RMC Kolkata.
 
 A squall passed over the city at 3.25pm with a wind speed of 52kmph. But it slowed gradually. Traffic movement was disrupted for about an hour when a tree was uprooted on Santoshpur Avenue. An lamppost caught fire at Sibtala Maath , snapping power connections in the area. A fire tender was deployed to put out the flames.
 
 An east-to-west trough line from Uttar Pradesh to Nagaland, across   and Bihar, pushed up the thundercloud formation. Almost all southern districts of Bengal received moderate rainfall. There was hailstorm in Hooghly and Howrah.
 
 “Since the surface has already cooled, chances of convective cloud formation in Gangetic West Bengal is low on Monday, unless some system develops over Bihar and Jharkhand,” said Das.
