GURUGRAM: On February 7, Dilbagh   lost balance while getting off a private bus and was run over by its rear tyres around 6pm near   on Golf Course Road. A crowd had gathered around Singh but none bothered to help him.

 Fortunately, Amiruddin, an auto driver, was crossing the road when he noticed Singh. Wasting no time, he rushed the accident victim to a nearby private hospital, thus saving the 17-year-old’s life. “When I took him to the hospital, doctors said he had internal bleeding and injuries. He had also suffered a fracture in his left leg. His family later offered me the fare, but I refused,”   told TOI.
 
 Fiftyfive-year-old Amiruddin is one of the 7,000   in the city, who have pledged to help road accident victims. And this month alone, they have helped over half a dozen road accident victims by making available timely medical help. 
 
 The initiative, they hope, will not only bring down the number of fatalities in road accidents, but also help change the image of auto drivers infamous for reckless driving and over-charging from commuters. In 2017, nearly 420 people lost their lives, while nearly 1,100 sustained injuries in road   in Gurugram. Bystanders often prefer to click photos instead of rushing the victims to hospitals. Notably, the first hour after an accident plays a crucial role in saving a person’s life.
 
 The auto union too has decided to give cash reward of Rs 251 to such drivers in order to motivate them. 
 
 “The reward will also bring a change in the attitude of the drivers,” said  , union president.
