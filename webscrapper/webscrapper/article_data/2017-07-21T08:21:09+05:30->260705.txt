AHMEDABAD: A second case of money being used on a credit card without a one-time password (OTP) has emerged. Cyber cell officials are probing the case of a Mumbai-based writer, Anshumali  , who lost $918 in two transactions.

 Earlier, Dr  , a resident of Naranpura who works at  , had lost Rs 2.34 lakh in nine transactions on his credit card without the use of an OTP. 
 
 Cyber cell officials said Jha also learned about the transactions on getting SMSes about the successful transactions on his mobile. Jha had come to Ahmedabad to see his daughter, who is studying in the city. “On Thursday morning, he got two messages from his bank about two withdrawals totalling $918,” said a crime branch official.
 
 A crime branch official said Jha immediately lodged a complaint against unknown cyber thieves. “We transferred the complaint to our cyber cell. We will write to the bank concerned about why no OTP was generated,” added an official.
