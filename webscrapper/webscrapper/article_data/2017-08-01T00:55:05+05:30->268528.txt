MUMBAI: Two Andheri youths died after falling off a running suburban train between   and   on Sunday. GRP officials said the duo was travelling on the   and one of them hit a pole and fell on the tracks, while his friend tried to catch him and fell too.

 Asif Ansari (20) and Shahnawaz Ansari (15), along with three of their friends, decided to head to go to Mahalaxmi and boarded a second-class compartment of a Churchgate-bound fast local from Andheri station around 3pm.
 
 “The coach was empty. Three of us decided to sit, but Asif and Shahnawaz stood at the door,” Izhar Ansari, a friend of the deceased, told the police. “At Lower Parel, a pole near the overbridge hit Shahnawaz and he lost his balance. Seeing him slip off the train, Asif tried to grab his hand. But both lost their footing and fell on the tracks. We pulled the chain, but the train did not stop before Mumbai Central station.” 
 
 Izhar and his friends got off at Mumbai Central and narrated the incident to the guard. They then boarded a slow train and went to Lower Parel station. The three youths were walking along the tracks looking for Asif and Shahnawaz when they spotted railway policemen lifting the injured duo. Asif and Shahnawaz were taken to hospital where they were pronounced dead by doctors. 
 
 Two accidental death cases were registered by the Mumbai Central GRP.
