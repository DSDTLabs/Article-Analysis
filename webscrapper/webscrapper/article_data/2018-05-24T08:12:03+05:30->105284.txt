CUTTACK: Normal life was affected by heavy rainfall on Wednesday morning as most of the areas in and around the city were waterlogged. While   (CMC) claimed full preparedness to deal with the waterlogging problem, reality proved to be different. 

 The low lying areas in the city were the worst hit. Areas like Madhupatana, Badambadi, Arunodaya Nagar, Bidanasi, Patapole and   went under water. Due to water-logging, vehicular movement was affected in Badambadi for some hours as the water was flowing over the main road. People were seen wading through knee deep water in Badambadi.
 
 "Waterlogging in our area has gone from bad to worst. Few spells of rain makes our life miserable. Most of the areas in the city are under water," said Arun Goenka, a resident of Buxi Bazar.
 
 "The CMC is responsible for the situation. In the absence of de-siltation, the drains are clogged," Goenka said.
 
 Residents of Rovers Street, Meria Bazar, Kesharpur, Alisha Bazar too were affected. Subash Biswal, a resident of   said, "Several areas of the city are jaundice affected. The present situation will see many more get affected."
 
 Corporators blamed the CMC authorities for the present crisis. "Desilting of the drains is yet to carried out. We have raised the issue in the council meeting but it has yielded little result," said Anita Nayak, a corporator of ward number 22.
 
 CMC commissioner Bikash Mohapatra admitted the delay in de-siltation and said "The tender has been allocated and de-siltation will start this week."
