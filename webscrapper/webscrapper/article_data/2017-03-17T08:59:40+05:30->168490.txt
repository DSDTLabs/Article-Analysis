 "I have to reach my examination centre on time. But I am getting late due to the traffic chaos," said Shelly Gupta, 18, a Class XII student and resident of Sector 8.
 
 Gurkirat Kaur, 40, a resident of Sector 7, said, "The police should have installed signboards informing about diversions a day before." 
 
 Traffic police said cops were deployed to manage vehicular movement. "We received no complaint and vehicles plied smoothly," said a cop.
