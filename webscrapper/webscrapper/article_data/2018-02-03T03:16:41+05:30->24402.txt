NEW DELHI: The   rejected on Friday a determined effort by petitioners to link the allegedly suspicious death of   “fake” encounter trial judge B H Loya to what they called the “unusual discharge” of   president   from the case.

 Appearing for Bombay Lawyers’ Association, senior advocate   told the court that the trial in the case was shifted to Mumbai on the SC’s order in 2010 because of the “involvement of police officials and particularly high officials of Gujarat”. 
 
 He said the SC order for trial by a single judge came to naught as the first trial judge was transferred “after obtaining from him a self-serving transfer request”, the second judge (Loya) died, and the third discharged Shah and other police officials in December 2014.
 
 Dave said the circumstances surrounding Loya’s sudden death raised suspicions. He was backed by senior advocate V Giri who appeared for another lawyers’ association, Indira Jaising, who appeared for an intervenor, and Gunratan Sadavarte, president of Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal Bar Association, all of them also targeting Shah.
 
 A bench of CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud clarified at the end of the days’ hearing, “We are only concerned with the case relating to Loya’s death and not with the Sohrabuddin fake encounter trial in this proceeding before us.”
 
 Dave was interrupted several times by Maharashtra government counsel Mukul Rohatgi, who said the threejudicial officers accompanying Loya when he died had presented affidavits saying there was no foul play, a claim he added was backed by the judge’s family.
 
 Dave replied, “I want to cross-examine the judges... I would request the Supreme Court to call the family members of Loya and interact with them. They are under tremendous pressure as was Loya while conducting trial in the Sohrabuddin case.” The arguments remained inconclusive and will resume on Monday.
