AMRITSAR: A day after the declaration of results of the Chief   (CKD) elections, the revelation made by its former secretary   has created stir in Panthic circles. Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Ankhi claimed that a group of around 24 women members of the CKD, with trimmed hair, changed the election results in favour of  , who enjoys close proximity with the ousted president Charanjit Singh Chadha. 

 Ankhi, who remained secretary of the CKD for two decades, alleged that majority of those women members were inducted into the CKD by Chadha, who had brought them for voting in vehicles arranged by him. He said according to CKD's constitution only 'sabat surat' (with unshorn hair) Sikh men and women members could participate in the elections. "I am of the view that the CKD polls were rigged. Not only the constitution of the CKD but the directions of Akal Takht jathedar were blatantly violated," alleged Ankhi. 
 
 He further alleged that a few office-bearers of the CKD involved in the election process were hand-in-glove with the Chadha-backed group and hastily managed to allow a group of women, many with shoulder cut hair, to cast their votes despite objections by many members. Ankhi, however, didn't mention about voting by non-baptized members in the elections.
 
 One of the CKD members, advocate  , said that it was the duty of election observers to disallow 'patit' (apostate) members to cast votes. "They should tell what parameters they adopted while allowing these women to cast their votes," he said.
