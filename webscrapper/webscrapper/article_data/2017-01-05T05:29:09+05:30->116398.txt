MUMBAI: The state urban development department has invited objections suggestions from the public over change of land use of 33 hectares in   to a metro car depot workshop, allied facilities and commercial zone. But the notification was issued on December 29, much after   ( ) started construction on the land.

 The notification states the land can be utilised for constructing the metro depot by saving more than 50% of the trees. R Ramana, executive director, MMRCL said the metro has been already sanctioned under the Metro Act. “Since MMRCL is an authority , we do not need permission from any other agency to begin construction for the metro project.Permissions such as change of land use are necessary before we begin operations. They will be in place,“ he said.
 
 Asked about the delay in seeking suggestions from the public, S Landge, joint secretary, urban development department, said the fact that the notification was issued now means the process has not yet been completed.
 
 “The government frames laws but authorities fail to adhere to them, making a mockery of both the law and the government,“ said D Stalin, director of the NGO Vanashakti. He filed several pleas before the   to declare all of Aarey an ecosensitive zone, also challenging the state's decision to hand three hectares to MMRCL for commercial exploitation.
 
 Another activist   said the notification states the government proposes to delete a No-Development Zone and convert it to a metro shed and commercial zone.“This clearly proves work done in Aarey till date is being carried out illegally in a NDZ,“ he said.
