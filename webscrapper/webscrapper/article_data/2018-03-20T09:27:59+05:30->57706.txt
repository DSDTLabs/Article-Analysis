PALAKKAD: The ambitious ‘Attappadi Millet Village’ project launched by the   government in 515 hectares in September has failed to yield the desired results like most other tribal development programmes in the past.

 The project aims at providing traditional staple and nutritious food to the residents of the 45 tribal hamlets who have been affected by malnutrition and infant deaths.
 
 According to the official figures, the seeds failed to sprout in 176.82 hectares due to ‘drought’.
 
 But the tribespeople said it failed because the officials did not listen to their advice not to take up cultivation after the monsoon was over because the cultivation is mainly rain-fed in the high ranges where irrigation is difficult.
 
 The total yield received from 515 hectares was only 75.317 metric tonnes, said special officer of the project and assistant director of agriculture department B  . After giving a share to the tribal farmers for cultivation in their land, the final yield available was only 5.212 metric tonnes, he added.
 
 The yield from 200 hectares of ragi cultivation was 13.507 metric tonnes and the surplus available for value addition is only 2.355 metric tonnes. In 60 hectares, the seeds failed to sprout, he said.
 
 “In 20 hectares ‘chama’ was cultivated and the yield was 3.109 metric tonnes and the surplus available for value addition is just 238kg. In six acres, the crop was destroyed. ‘Thina’ was cultivated in 40 hectares and the yield was 3.109 metric tonnes and the surplus available is only 47kg, and in six hectares the crop failed. ‘Varagu’ was cultivated in 10 hectares and the yield was 536kg and the surplus available is just 7kg. In 2.19 hectares the crop failed. ‘Kuthiravali’ was cultivated in 30 hectares and the yield got was 1.782 metric tonnes and the surplus available is 15kg and in 13.1 hectares the crop got destroyed,” he added.
 
 Pulses were cultivated in 200 hectares and the yield was 49.525 metric tonnes. The surplus available is only 2,430kg. The crop was destroyed in 75.15 hectares.
 
 Vegetables were cultivated in 15 hectares and the yield was 5.450 metric tonnes and the   was only 120kg and in 6.5 hectares it got destroyed, Kumar said.
 
 Undeterred by the failure of the scheme in its first year, it will again be taken up from April during the 2018-19 financial year with a financial outlay of Rs 2.57 crore in 485 hectares in 45 hamlets. A millet processing and value addition unit will be set up at a cost of Rs 35 crore, he said.
