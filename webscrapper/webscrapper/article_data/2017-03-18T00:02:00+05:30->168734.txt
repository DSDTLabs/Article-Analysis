Jaipur: The Congress on Friday declared former minister Banwari Lal Sharma (78) as its candidate for the   assembly by-poll scheduled on April 9. Sharma would file his nomination papers on March 20.

 The ruling BJP has fielded Shobharani, wife of former BSP legislator B L Kushwah, from the assembly seat that is home turf of chief minister Vasundhara Raje. “My father defeated Raje from Dholpur in the 1993 assembly elections,” said Ashok Sharma, son of the Congress candidate. 
 
 Banwari Lal Sharma has been a legislator for five terms and has served as PHED minister under the then chief minister Jagannath Pahadia in the early 1980s.
 
 The by-poll would be significant for both Congress and BJP as the result would be perceived as a barometer of people’s mood in the state ahead of the main assembly elections due next year.
