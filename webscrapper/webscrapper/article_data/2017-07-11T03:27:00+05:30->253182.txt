Panaji: After day-long deliberations, the central leadership of the Congress party decided to nominate the newly-appointed state president of the party Shantaram Naik for the Rajya Sabha polls. “All India Congress committee president Sonia Gandhi and vice-president Rahul Gandhi approved the name of Shantaram Naik as the Congress candidate for the Rajya Sabha seat,” AICC incharge of Goa desk A Chellakumar said late evening. Many Congress MLAs were in favour of nominating Goa Forward Party office bearer Suraj Lotlikar, with the hope that the regional party leader and town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai would ditch the BJP. With Congress divided and the central leadership not in favour with the proposal to nominate Lotlikar, the plan fell through and the party had to look for a fresh face. The other three possible candidates were former Union law minister Ramakant Khalap, Jitendra Deshprabhu and former MP Ramakant Angle. Party insiders suggest that Naik enjoys the respect of certain BJP allies and is said to be close to Margao MLA Digambar Kamat and other South Goa-based politicians. Goa desk in-charge and AICC secretary A Chellakumar flew into Goa late Monday for discussions with MLAs. Several Congress MLAs who are said to be close to Atanasio Monserrate and Goa Forward Party supremo Vijai Sardesai had proposed Lotlikar’s name. “Some MLAs were convinced by Monserrate that Vijai would support Congress if Lotlikar was named as the candidate,” a Congress worker said. With Sardesai refuting talk that he will pull down the Parrikar government, Lotlikar has dropped out of the running.
