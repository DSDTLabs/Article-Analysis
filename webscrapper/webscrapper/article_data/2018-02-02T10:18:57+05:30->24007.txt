TRICHY: Actor Rajinikanth fans in the city on Thursday launched a mobile   on wheels to rope in members from rural pockets of the district under Rajini Makkal Mandram (Rajini People’s Forum). With 7 lakh enrolments set as target, the vehicle equipped with a cameraman and banners of superstar will be on the move across 404 panchayats in Trichy district to add members for the actor’s forum in the next two weeks. 

 Exactly a month after announcing his decision to launch a political party and to contest in all the assembly constituencies in the election scheduled for 2021, actor Rajinikanth converted his fans club associations across the state to people’s forum.

To overcome the constraint, Rajini fans on Thursday modified a load vehicle with speakers and banners displaying Rajinikanth to tour the district as mobile enrolment vehicle.
 
 “Enrolment camps are already underway in the city for past few weeks, yet we would like to reach the rural people. To record pictures of interested members, a photographer will be available in the van, people can either show their voter identification card or Aadhaar card as proof,” S  , district secretary of Rajinikanth fans welfare association.
 
 Stating that launching an exclusive vehicle for adding members is first of its kind in the state, the fans club claimed that already two lakh members have been added to the actor’s forum.
