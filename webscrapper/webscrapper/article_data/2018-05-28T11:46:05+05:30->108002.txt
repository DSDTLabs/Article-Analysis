VASCO: Mormugao Municipal Council ( ) has found a solution to dispose its dry waste.

 Since 2015, dry waste that is brought to MMC’s treatment plant at Headland–Sada is sent to Karnataka for co-incineration in a cement kiln. MMC chief officer  , said “The company’s trucks carry non-biodegradable, non-recyclable plastic waste only. The plastic waste is transported from the site at Sada, Vasco, to Vasavadatta Cement, Sedam, Karnataka, for co-incineration in their cement kiln on behalf of the state level monitoring-cum-working committee for solid waste management in Goa.”
 
 “The waste is used to generate a type of energy required for the cement factory. It’s not seen as waste but as a means to create energy,” he added. The MMC only sends 25-30% of the waste to the cement company and the rest is dumped at the treatment plant at Sada. 
 
 Fernandes says this is because the MMC gets only 25% to 30% of waste that is segregated. “People mix their waste. If more people segregate waste, we can send more dry waste to the cement kiln,” said Fernandes.
