Mohali: A local court on Thursday sentenced four persons of a family to seven years of rigorous imprisonment on charges of killing daughter-in-law of their family.

 The court held husband of the deceased, Navdeep Malhotra, father-in-law Ashok Malhotra, mother-in-law Urmila Malhotra and sister-in-law Monica guilty of killing of Babita.
 
 According to the counsel of the deceased’s father, who was the complainant, all the four convicts had killed Babita and then tried to mislead police by hanging her body from a fan. Before police arrived they brought down the body to the ground floor. It was on June 6, 2016 when Babita at around 1.50 pm called her parents complaining that her in-laws had been harassing her to bring in more dowry worth Rs 20 lakh so that they can get their daughter Monica married. On refusing the demand, Babita was allegedly killed around 3pm by her in-laws following which they called up Babita’s parents and said that the latter had committed suicide. Babita was mother of a six-month-old baby girl. She had been married for less than two years. 
 
 The counsel said, “We proved that Babita did not die due to choking as a result of being hanged as the family tried portray but her husband along with his father, mother and sister had killed her.”
 
 He added that they have been sentenced to 7 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 304-B of the IPC, which reads, ‘where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called “dowry death”, and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.’
 
 The accused have also been sentenced under sections 302 and 34 of the IPC, stated the counsel.
