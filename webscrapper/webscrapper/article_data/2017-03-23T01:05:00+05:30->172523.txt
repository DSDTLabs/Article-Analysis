Kolkata: Twenty four hours after World Poetry Day was celebrated, an   was lodged against poet Srijato Bandyopadhyay. The FIR was filed after a complaint from a college student of Bagdogra to the 12-line poem, ‘Abhishap’, that Srijato had posted on social media on March 19, soon after Aditya Nath Yogi took charge as the Uttar Pradesh CM.

 “The FIR has been lodged under Section 295 (A) of IPC and Section 67 of IT Act,” said Siliguri police commissioner C S Lepcha. Srijato was unavailable for comment.
 
 Complainant Arnab Sarkar congratulated the police for taking action. “Under no circumstances should Srijato be allowed to wriggle out of this situation by tendering an apology. He should get the strictest punishment,” Sarkar said.
 
 Trinamool MLA Chiranjeet Chakraborty said such an FIR is a reflection of the troubled times we live in. “The world is becoming highly politicised. Religion is playing a big role. We are seeing a rise of votebank politics. As a result, the space for free thought is shrinking. Those who have a problem with Srijato’s verse could have criticised it. But why drag him to court,” asked Chakraborty. 
 
 Drawing the example of Taslima Nasreen, BJP leader Locket Chatterjee insisted there can’t be two sets of norms for people insulting religious sentiments in Bengal.
