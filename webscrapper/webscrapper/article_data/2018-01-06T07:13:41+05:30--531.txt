CHENNAI: Co-convict in the disproportionate assets case and  's aide V K   has locked horns with the one-man Justice Arumughasamy Commission of Inquiry. Through her lawyer Raja Senthur  , Sasikala has stated that she would file an affidavit only after she is given evidence filed by other witnesses who have deposed before the commission. 

 Sasikala, who is serving a sentence in a prison in Bengaluru, was served the summons on December 21 as "some of the witnesses examined by the commission gave evidence affecting her prejudicially". She was asked to file a sworn affidavit within 15 days from the receipt of the summons.
 
 Pandian, who filed the counter with the commission recently, said that no evidences were furnished along with the summons and hence Sasikala was not in a position to respond appropriately. "At this juncture, Sasikala denies such evidence of witnesses given in her absence," the affidavit stated.
 
 Pandian also stated that under the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, a reasonable opportunity of being heard in the inquiry and to produce evidence in defence is permitted. The commission has been requested to furnish details of witnesses in a tabular column containing the name of witnesses, date of evidence, nature of documents filed, if any, by such witnesses.  's counsel should then be given 15 days' time to cross-examine the witnesses before the commission and then she would file her sworn affidavit along with her evidence via her counsel.
