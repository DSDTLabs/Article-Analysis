 The suspect contacted the 65-year-old woman over the phone, and convinced her to buy an "insurance policy" by promising her attractive returns to the tune of Rs1 crore. He asked her to deposit money in different bank accounts as fees and charges for the policy. 
 
 A team headed by deputy commissioner of police (economics & cyber) Sudhir Hiremath, inspectors Jairam Paigude and Radhika Phadke arrested Singh after tracking down through his bank account details and Internet protocol (IP) address.
 
 A graduate, Singh would frequently call people and urge them to invest in different policy products purportedly being offered by the company he works for.
 
 One such call was received by the complainant, a resident of Sinhagad Road, late last year. He convinced her to buy "policy" by telling her she stood to get Rs1 crore on her investment in a few years, police said.
 
 Singh told the woman to pay different processing fees and other charges, and also asked her to deposit some money towards the premium. Acting on Singh's instructions, the woman paid a total of Rs5 lakh.
 
 According to the police, Singh was never previously arrested or booked. "He accepted amounts ranging from Rs30,000 to Rs40,000 from his victims," Paigude said, "We suspect that he duped many people across India. Our investigation is underway."
