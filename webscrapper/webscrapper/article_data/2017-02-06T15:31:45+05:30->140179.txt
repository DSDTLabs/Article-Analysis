CHENNAI: The recent oil spillage off Kamarajar Port in Ennore has had no impact on the two desalination plants in Minjur and  , officials in Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board said on Monday.

 Two vessels, the MT BW Maple and the MT Dawn Kanchipuram, collided in the early hours of January 28. The MT Dawn Kanchipuram, which was carrying 32,813 tonnes of oil, had suffered damage, leading to oil spill.
 
 Although the desalination plant in Minjur, which provides 100 million litres of treated water a day to parts of North Chennai, is barely 10km from the troubled spot, the pipeline that draws water is placed at a depth of nine metre. 
 
 "We haven't found any traces of oil slick close to the desal plants," said a   official, adding that treated water was also being tested daily.
 
 As on Sunday, Minjur plant produced 95 MLD of water, Nemmeli supplied 91 MLD. On Saturday, a team of senior Metrowater officials visited both the plants.
 
 The raw water for the plant in Nemmeli, which caters to residents in south Chennai, is sourced through a 1,050 metre-long pipeline, which is sunk at a depth of nearly 14 metre in the sea.
 
 Teams working on clearing the spillage said by Monday morning close to 80 tonne of sludge has been removed and more than 95% of the work completed.
