CHANDIGARH:   vice-chancellor ( ) Prof Arun Kumar   on Sunday lashed out at the syndicate and senate members stating that they have failed to protect the office of the vice-chancellor of this university. Further questioning, he said, “Have you seen a university where a sitting governing body member makes false case of   against the vice-chancellor of a university?” On hearing this, the complainant, a member of the governing body, broke down into tears. 

 “Tell me any university in the country where a sitting syndicate member can put a false complaint against the VC. The matter is raised to the syndicate meeting within a week. Five weeks later, a case is filed with the UT administration. If you   Arun Kumar Grover, it says the “accused vice-chancellor”. You have all functioned under an accused VC, and accused by whom--one of you and you have done nothing,” said Grover in the senate meeting on Sunday.
 
 “This is the governance of the university wherein syndicate and senate members lodge complaints against each other. You are all worried about your own ego and honour. What about mine? Is this the way to behave with the VC? What answer do the senate and syndicate have to justify the humiliation meted out to me in the past three years? Where are the political parties of India who are responsible for causing problems to the university?” said Grover. 
 
 Elaborating on the sequence of events, he added, “As soon as my second term commenced, the   student wing of a major political party came and gave me a memorandum stating that loot and plunder is going on in the university.   filed a complaint that loot and plunder is going on in the university and MHRD formed a fact-finding committee. I have to go and now respond to two fact-finding committees. However, we never got the reports of those fact-finding committees. Did any of the governing bodies try to find out that why was the university subjected to all this?”
