NAGPUR: In a bid to give Seminary Hill Square, near rear gate of Raj Bhavan, a complete makeover and ease traffic movement, the   is constructing a rotary or roundabout at the junction. 

 This junction is one of the busiest ones in west Nagpur in terms of size and number of connecting roads — Sadar, Dharampeth, Civil Lines, Katol Road and Gittikhadan. Thousands of motorists pass through the junction every day.
 
 “The existing island (towards  ) is big and not easing the traffic in any way. The spot also sees many mishaps,” said a city traffic cop.
 
 “It’s after 4 years of persistent follow-up by the traffic police that the NMC is constructing a rotary here,” said senior police inspector Pradeep Lambat. 
 
 Strangely, the traffic department never posted personnel at this spot. As a result, motorists would speed on the stretch giving little opportunities for pedestrians to cross the road. There are no speed breakers here too.
 
 The redevelopment of this junction is a part of an ongoing junction improvement plan being carried out by the civic body on the city’s most accident prone squares. The authorities were also instructed to strictly adhere to the quality and safety norms while carrying out the work. The NMC will spend Rs16 lakh for the purpose. 
 
 “While this development would help ease the movement of traffic, they would also ensure safety of the motorists and help in preventing accidents,” said a senior NMC official.
 
 Vehicles that have to take the right turn while coming from Katol Square often get stuck. It leads to congestion at the square.
