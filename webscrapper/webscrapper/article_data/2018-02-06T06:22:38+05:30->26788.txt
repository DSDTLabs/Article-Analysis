NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s historic visit to Palestine on February 10 will see him personally reiterating India’s support to the Palestinian cause and expressing solidarity with the people of Palestine.

 
 Briefing reporters ahead of the trip, the ministry of external affairs said Modi will visit the   museum in   and also attend a ceremony in honour of the late Palestinian leader.
 
 Bala Bhaskar, joint secretary (West Asia and  ) in the MEA, said there were four dimensions to the visit to Palestine. First, he said, the PM was going there himself and reiterating India’s commitment personally to the Palestinian leadership.
 
 Secondly, India had contributed immensely to Palestine’s nation-building efforts, including infrastructure development and capacity building. Bhaskar said since the historic visit of then President   to Palestine in 2015, work on projects worth $30 million had commenced.
 
 This apart, the prime minister’s visit is also aimed at deepening the huge bilateral agenda, including cooperation in the areas of health, IT, tourism, youth affairs, sports and agriculture.
 
 The fourth aspect, according to Bhaskar, was India’s continuous support to the Palestinian cause at various international fora. India had voted in the   in December last year against US President Donald Trump’s unilateral recognition of   as the capital of Israel.
