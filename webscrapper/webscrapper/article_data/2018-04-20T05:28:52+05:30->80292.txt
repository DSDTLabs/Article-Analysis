HYDERABAD: The judge, who quit after pronouncing the verdict in the   blast case, resumed duties on Thursday and also requested the Hyderabad high court to allow him to take voluntary retirement, apparently to avail retirement benefits. 

 K  , the Fourth Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge, had put in his papers citing “personal reasons”, barely hours after acquitting right-wing activist   and five others in the Mecca Masjid blast case on April 16. However, the HC found that his representation seeking voluntary retirement wasn’t filed in the proper format. 
 
 The AP Pension rules make it mandatory for all those who want to avail voluntary retirement to file their representation by giving three months’ notice. Reddy would attain the age of 58 in June 2018 and would retire in normal course unless a two-year extension is given to him. However, such an extension is not automatic and involves a review and assessment by the HC. 
 
 Though the judge didn’t have the three-month service left to fulfil the norm, it is within the discretion of the HC to consider such a case, sources said. “His application for resignation is still pending. He has joined duty and is attending the bench,” a source in the judiciary, pleading anonymity, told PTI. 
 
 On Thursday, the HC suspended two more district judges facing charges of corruption. S  , second additional metropolitan sessions judge at Hyderabad Criminal Courts Complex, Nampally, was placed under suspension. Similarly,  , special judge in  , was placed under suspension. Acting on a complaint by lawyers questioning some of Rao’s verdicts, an HC inquiry found the allegations were true.
