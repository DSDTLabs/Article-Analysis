NEW DELHI:   is examining the issue of windshield cracks on its 787 Dreamliners after   experienced three such cases recently, a senior official of the aerospace firm said on Thursday. 

 Earlier this month, a   plane was forced to return to IGI following a crack in the cockpit window. A similar issue was reported in December and in August as well.
 
 "Air India went through that problem three years ago and we changed the model of the windshield. We are now studying the windows in the shop to understand what happened," said Dinesh  , senior vice president of sales   and India at Boeing Commercial Airplanes.
 
 These recent instances, however, do not affect flight safety, he added. "There are layers of protection on the windshield (and) there is certainly no issue of safety of the flight," Keskar said.
