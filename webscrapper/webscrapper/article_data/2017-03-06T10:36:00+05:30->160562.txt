The Krishna Patel-led faction of   vows to make   pay for conspiring to divide the party and that their dream of victory in 2017 Assembly polls would be shattered. 

  said, " BJP ne na sirf party barbaad karne ki koshish ki balki mere bachchey ko bhi chheen liya (BJP not only tried to damage my party it snatched away my child-daughter Union minister Anupriya Patel)." 
 
 Krishna's other daughter Pallavi Patel said, "BJP will pay for its misdeeds. If it succeeded in winning 73 seats in UP in 2014 Parliamentary election with the support of united Apna Dal, this time it has the support of only Anupriya while party's vote base and all workers are with us."
 
 Anupriya faction, on the other hand, claimed that Krishna's group would not harm BJP as its candidates are contesting as Independent candidates. 
 
 Krishna and Pallavi are confident that their party can surprise all major players at 20 of 70 seats in the region where its candidates are in fray. Krishna group has formed alliance with Peace Party and Babu Singh Kushwaha's Jan Adhikar Manch.
 
 Pallavi said these 20 seats, including Rohaniya, Sevapuri, Mariyahu, Pratapgarh Sadar, Vishwanathganj, Karchhana, Pratappur, Phoolpur, Nawabganj (Phaphamau), Baveru, Chayal and Mughalsarai are seats where party has strong organizational structure at each booth.
