BADAL: Defying age, Punjab chief minister was in high spirits when he stepped out to exercise the right to franchise in his native village. At 89, Badal has taken part in so many elections -- be it general, assembly or for panchayati raj institution (PRI) -- in 60 years of his political life that he fails to remember how many times he has exercised his voting right. 

 But ask him about elections won, and his memory is razor sharp. He has won the assembly election 10 times and parliament election once -- in 1977. He won the first assembly election in 1957 from Malout assembly constituency and then five times from Gidderbaha and four times from Lambi assembly. 
 
 “Politics is my passion and any election is the best time for me as it gives me extra energy and I enjoy fighting,” he quips. When asked how he feels about contesting against former CM Amarinder Singh, who is 15 years younger to him, and much younger former Delhi MLA Jarnail Singh, he replies swiftly, “I am the youngest of all three, in energy and in stamina. I am also the young at heart.” On his opponent Amarinder’s announcement that this would be his last election, Badal said, “I am a fighter and will keep on fighting till my last.” 
 
 The Badals maintain that SAD would definitely retain power for a third record time, and that too with absolute majority and win even more seats than it had in the 2012 elections. Predicting a big win for SAD, party president and deputy chief minister Sukhbir Badal even gave the seat share, saying, “SAD will win more than 75 seats, Congress 30 and AAP will be limited to 10 seats across Punjab.”
 
 Former finance minister and Badal’s estranged nephew Manpreet Badal, however, maintained that people were getting restive and wanted to oust the CM’s family for 10 years of misrule. “The Congress will win absolute majority and provide better governance,” he said.
