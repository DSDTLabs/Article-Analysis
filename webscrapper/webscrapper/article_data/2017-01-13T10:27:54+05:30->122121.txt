ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Thursday directed the state government to file a reply (counter affidavit) in response to a PIL challenging a government order (GO) to include 17 castes belonging to the Other Backward Castes (OBC) category in the list of Scheduled Castes. 

 Hearing the PIL filed by one  , a division bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice   fixed February 9 as the next date of hearing.
 
 The petitioner contended in the PIL that the Constitution empowers only the Central government to include or exclude a caste from the list of Schedule Castes. Hence, a decision by the state government in this regard is clearly violative of Article 341 of the Constitution as it is not empowered to initiate the process of inclusion of a caste in the list of Schedule Castes on its own. 
 
 Article 341 stipulates that   may by law include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled Castes specified in a notification issued under clause of any caste, race or tribe or part of or group within any caste, race or tribe.
 
 The petition stated that the state government had issued a GO on December 22, 2016, for inclusion of 17 castes belonging to OBC category into the Schedule Caste list. In pursuance to this order, the personnel department of the state government issued a notification on December 31, 2016, to this effect and also ordered to provide all the facilities of Scheduled Castes to the said 17 OBC category people.
 
 In a state cabinet meeting presided over by chief minister   on December 22, 2016, it was recommended to include Kahar, Kashyap, Kewat, Nishad, Bind, Bhar, Prajapati, Rajbhar, Batham, Gaur, Tura, Majhi, Mallah, Kumhar, Dheemar and Machua sub-castes belonging to OBC in the Scheduled Caste category. 
 
 According to the petitioner, after the state cabinetâ€™s nod to this proposal, the matter would be sent to the Centre for its affirmation.
