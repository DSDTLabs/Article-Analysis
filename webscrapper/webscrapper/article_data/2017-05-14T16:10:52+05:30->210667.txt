PANAJI: The   ( ) scoffed at the heated political discussions over the last few days that Congress is staging a comeback by overthrowing the Parrikar-led coalition government.

 The party on Saturday reiterated that its coalition would complete the 5-year term and that around 10 Congress MLAs are ready to join the BJP fold.
 
 Speaking to mediapersons, BJP state president Vinay Tendulkar said the coalition partners have already made statements that their support to the government will continue till the expiry of their term.
 
 During the last couple of days, Congress leaders have come together to regain power. They also had a meeting with former  , Atanasio Monserrate and discussed formation of Congress government in the state. The party also urged Monserrate to join Congress and contest byelection from   against Parrikar.
 
 BJP general secretary, Sadanand Tanawade downplayed the incident saying a meeting at   residence shows the weakness of the Congress party. “We will win both the constituencies with a huge margin,” he added.
 
 Reacting to the disqualification petition against health minister, Vishwajit Rane, Tendulkar said ‘’Congress wants to prevent Rane from contesting the byelection. It is scared of losing both the constituencies.’’
 
 He questioned Congress party’s rationale behind filing the petition after a wait of two months.
 
 “We publically condemn Congress’ act of filling the petition. We will stand by him,” he said, adding, “It ought to have been filed before the speaker and not the court.’’
 
 ‘’For the first time in the political history of India any political party must have filed a disqualification petition against a person who is not the member of the assembly,’’ Tanawade reacted.
 
 He further said that disqualification petitions are filed to threaten MLAs who are likely to quit the Congress. The byelection for the two vacant assembly seats are likely to be held either in the last week of August or first week of September, sources said.
