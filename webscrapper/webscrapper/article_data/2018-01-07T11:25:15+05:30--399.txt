JAIPUR: Private schools have advanced the counselling for students appearing in the board examination. The focus is not on waiting for the students or parents to approach them but even teachers are making an extra effort to spot change in students’ behaviour.

 The growing awareness about the counselling has forced many schools to start the counselling with students and parents. Many schools have completed the pre-board examinations while some will complete in January.
 
 Principal of Cambridge Court High School Lata   said that counselling has become a yearly exercise. “All stakeholders have become active to prevent any students from taking an iota of stress. The process to de-stress takes a long so our focus is to not let any student into the situation. Our teachers are in constant touch with the parents and students. The first step is to spot the change in students’ behaviour which gives an idea about students’ mental health,” said Rawat.
 
 During this time of a year students shows stress due to pressure of performance.  , principal of St Anslm’s Sen Sec School has started a mentor system by allowing students to choose any one the teacher as mentors. “This is a modern age problem coupled with the advent of social media which has distracted the students. The mentors system allows students to get in touch with any teacher in accordance with their comfort,” said Manickam.
 
 Principal of Army Public School in Jodhpur, Tabussum Khan, says that they are working hard on creating a system where students can approach teachers to share anything. “Over the years the approach for handling students has changed. Earlier the focus was on academics but now we try to understand students from different perspective. Students who performs poorly are given attention by the teachers and in case we notice any major change we inform parents,” said Khan.
