MOHALI: The hike in transfer fee and processing fee by Greater   Area Developmental Authority ( ) will directly reflect on the real estate buyers as well as sellers. Now, the buyers will have to pay Rs 37,500 as transfer fee for 100 square yards residential plot, which was previously Rs 30,000.

 The hike will now be computed at the rate of 2.5% of the cost per square yards of the plot, which was 2% earlier. Similarly the hike of 10% has also been imposed on theprocessing fee from Rs 5,229 to Rs 5,350 inclusive of GST.
  
  
 The real estate agents in the city fear that this hike may directly affect the already drowning real estate business as well the pockets of the buyers. Shailender Anand former president of Mohali Property Consultants’ Association ( ) said, “Increase in transfer fee will add to our woes. Already, there is a slump in the property market in the region. There are virtually no buyers in the market. This is not a friendly move and will discourage the buyers.” He also said the buyer will now have to pay Rs 7,500 more as per the hike for 100 square yards plot whereas this hike may end up making a hole in the pockets of the buyer for Rs 47,500 for a residential plot of one kanal. The major effect will be on the bigger area plots of 2,000 square yards residential plots in Eco City-II, for which the transfer fee has been hiked from Rs 1.2 lakh to 1.5 lakh. In the commercial category, the hike will be Rs 50,000 for a 100 square-yard plot for which the buyer will have to pay Rs 3.05 lakh transfer fee against Rs 2.5 lakh in plots in Sectors 88/89.
