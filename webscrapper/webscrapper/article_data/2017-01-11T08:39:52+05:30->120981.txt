MUMBAI: Civic poll fever hasn't spared the police force. A sub-inspector from the eastern suburbs has quit his job to contest the BMC elections.

 Jogeshwari resident  , 54, who was attached to the   police station, resigned in October. “On October 8 last year I gave my resignation, which was accepted on January 5. In my two years with the Shivaji Nagar police station, I understood that several problems plague the area. Therefore I am planning to contest the elections from here itself,“ Kamble told TOI. He said local people pursued him to take the decision. He has completed 32 years in the police.
 
 “From poverty to crime, this area has many issues that I want to solve. I want to work for people as a social worker. I want to show what it is like to work for the development of society without any political agenda,“ he said.
 
 Before Shivaji Nagar, he was with police stations like Meghwadi in Jogeshwari and Kherwadi in Bandra (east).
 
 Meanwhile, there are rumours that MNS party leader in the BMC  's wife may contest the polls considering Deshpande's ward, 185 (Shivaji Park, Dadar), has been reserved for a woman candidate.
