Mumbai: The   on Thursday granted   to  , promotor of realty firm  , in two criminal cases of cheating flat buyers of over Rs 50 crore. He has been in custody since September 2016, following his arrest first by Azad Maidan police and then by the economic offences wing.

 Aggarwal’s counsel Ashok Mundargi and Aniket Nikam, at the hearing of his bail plea before Justice P D Naik, said the managing director and CEO of the realty firm has been in custody for over 10 months and the chargesheet was filed in November 2016. Mundargi said Aggarwal’s continued custody is no longer essential also because the alleged case is based on documentary evidence and his release on bail at this stage would not impede the case. The court granted him bail of Rs 1 lakh surety each in both cases. He is likely to be released from Arthur Road jail after he completes bail formalities, said his other lawyer Subhash Jadhav. As Aggarwal’s passport is with the EOW, there is no question of him leaving the country, his lawyers said.
 
 Police had arrested Aggarwal following an FIR by Capri Global Capital Ltd against Orbit Corporation and its two promoters—Ravi Kiran Aggarwal and his son Pujit—for having cheated it of Rs 2.53 crore over three flats it had booked in   at   only to find out they were already mortgaged to LIC Housing Finance Ltd and were up for auction. In the second case, 82 people who booked flats claimed they were not given a full disclosure and 34 of them filed a complaint.
