The peaceful candlelight vigil that was planned as a tribute to   at   on the midnight of January 17 was not spared the policing that began early on Tuesday at the campus. The day that marked one year since the suicide of the scholar turned violent early in the afternoon when the Cyberabad Police took positions in front of the entrance preventing any outsiders from entering the campus, forcing the students from other varsities and members of political organisations to join the ‘Shahadath Din’ protest from outside the gate. Cries for justice and fiery slogans, such as ‘Rohith Vemula amar rahe’, ‘Rohith Vemula ko neel salam’, ‘We want Rohith Act’ were heard as protesters on both the sides of the gate tried to bring the barriers down. Rohith’s mother Radhika, brother   and friend Riyaz, who came from   were also detained after Radhika’s speech, along with other six students. However, after a prolonged struggle the gates finally opened, allowing the dissenters outside to join the HCU students, and the protesters who were detained were released.
