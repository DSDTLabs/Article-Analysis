Shraddha asks Thapki and Bani to leave their house. Bani starts crying and tells Tina that she doesn't want to leave her. During this, Thapki slips and falls off the stairs.
 
  Bihaan lifts her and makes her rest on the sofa. Doctor checks Thapki and tells everyone that she is hurt badly and will have to rest for some time.
  
  Shraddha gets angry and suggests to call an ambulance to drop Thapki at her house. Bihaan tells everyone that Thapki won't go anywhere till she gets fine.
  
  Suman and Preeti take Thapki to her room. Shraddha comes in and starts blaming her again and warns her to be away from Bihaan.
  
  Dhruv also comes and blames Thapki for taking away his love from him. Later in the night, Thapki gets up and walks around in the house with the help of a supporting stick. She watches Bihaan sleep and thinks about him.
  
  Just then Sankara comes in and threatens Thapki. Thapki tells her that she won't let her give wrong medicines to Bihaan.
