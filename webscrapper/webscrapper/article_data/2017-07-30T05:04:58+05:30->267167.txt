MUMBAI: A 50-year-old man who allegedly made two bomb hoax calls to the railways within a month was arrested by the railway police crime branch on Thursday . Babu Chauhan, a pavement dweller, was traced with the help of   grabs. As the hoax calls were registered as a non-cognizable offence, the police had to take a railway court's permission to arrest Chauhan. He has been sent to judicial custody.

 According to the police, Chauhan is a native of Ahmedabad.On July 13, the railway helpline '182' received an anonymous phone call at 10.44 am. The caller said “there would be blasts at Churchgate station just like the explosions in Srinagar“. The authorities went into a tizzy and Churchgate station was thoroughly combed. Nothing untoward was found. The police then checked the number from where the anonymous call had been made. The number was traced to a public phone booth outside platform 1of Churchgate station. The police then checked CCTV footage for 10.44 am in the stretch near the   booth. They noticed Chauhan speaking on the phone. Through their informants, the cops tracked down Chauhan.
 
 Investigations revealed that Chauhan, an alcoholic, had made another hoax call on July 5 around 7.55 pm, saying “explosives were arriving from   and police bandobast be increased at all stations on July 6“. On interrogation, Chauhan claimed that he had overheard a group of suspicious-looking men talking about explosives and Kharghar station. “He dialled the railway helpline as he had often seen the number `182' pasted on walls of the disabled compartment,“ said inspector   of GRP crime branch. The police are said they are not buying Chauhan's version and suspect he has made more hoax calls in the past.
