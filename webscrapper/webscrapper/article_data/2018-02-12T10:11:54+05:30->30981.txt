MARGAO: Town and country planning ( ) minister   on Sunday continued to be unapologetic about his remarks terming “some domestic tourists as the scum of the earth”.

 “Everyone is welcome to Goa. I also believe in ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’. I do not wish to make any discrimination between people from north or south India. We are creating a clean, green and smart Goa. It is said that cleanliness is next to Godliness. So if those coming to Goa maintain cleanliness, they are most welcome. We need tourists who keep Goa clean and green. It is a small section that is creating a nuisance,”   told the media after flagging off the Carnival float parade in   on Sunday evening.
 
 On Saturday, Sardesai had stated that he is not xenophobic.
