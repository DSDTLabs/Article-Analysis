The portal will be introduced soon by the forest department so that tourists can apply online for permission to enter the reserved forest and book a certified guide, security, accommodation, safari and other facilities. 
 
 Vijay Mohanraj, chief conservator of forest, Belagavi region, said, “There are many strict regulations which should be followed during issuing permission. The online option will surely be helpful to tourists.”
