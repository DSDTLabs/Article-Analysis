MUMBAI: The rate of increase of total   paid by   (MNCs) operating in India has outpaced the rate of growth of pre-tax profits by these companies in the last five years. In fiscal 2016 alone, 32 of the top MNCs in the country have repatriated Rs 7,100 crore to their parents, up from Rs 6,300 crore a year earlier, a report by   ( ), a leading proxy advisory firm noted.

 According to the report, in FY16, the royalty paid out aggregated about 21% of the MNCs’ pre-royalty pre-tax profits, showing a 13.2% average annual growth (CAGR) over a five year period. “In contrast, pre-royalty pre-tax profits have grown at a CAGR of 9.6% and net sales have grown by 8.7%,” it pointed out. The proxy advisory firm believes that companies should provide “greater clarity regarding the basis on which royalty is paid-out, given that it has outpaced both sales and profits in the past five years.” Thse 32 MNCs are part of the BSE 500 index which constitute all the leading listed companies in the country.
 
 IiAS said that payment of royalty was perfectly legal under Indian laws but its value must be evidenced in sales growth or higher pricing power (and therefore higher margins). “The parent company needs to be compensated for brand and technical know-how. However, such payments need to be pegged at an appropriate level,” it noted.
