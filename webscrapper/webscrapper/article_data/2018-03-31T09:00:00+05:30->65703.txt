Model   suggests how to keep it cool this  ...

 I religiously follow some basics like hydrating my body as much as possible. I make   my best friend during this time of the year. Having flavoured water by adding some fresh citrus fruits or herbs also keeps me going during summer. I ensure I cover my face up with a cotton scarf when I am going out and wear loose- fitting clothes made of light fabrics. Drinking   juice is a great option to stay hydrated during the hot days of summer. Whenever you feel exhausted in the sun, keep a wet wipe or a cooling face mist and clean your face with it. Also, using   is a must and it should be applied every two-three hours.
