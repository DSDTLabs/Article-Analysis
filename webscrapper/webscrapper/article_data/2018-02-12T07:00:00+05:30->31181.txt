Ludhiana: A court has sentenced a man to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment after finding him guilty of raping a minor girl, and also imposed a fine of rupees one lakh on him.

 On 14 October 2016, Jagraon police had booked the accused under sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, after allegations of rape against him. In her statement to the police, the survivorâ€™s mother had said she and her nine-year-old daughter lived in the house of the accused, and she did the household work of the accused.
 
 She added her daughter had told her that the accused forcibly took her to the fields where he raped her, and threatened to kill her if she revealed about the incident to anyone. After the case was registered against the accused, the police arrested him and later presented a challan against him in a court of law. During the trial, the accused pleaded not guilty, but could not produce solid evidence in favour of his statement.
 
 On the other hand, the prosecution pleaded for severe punishment for the accused. The court observed that the prosecution was able to prove allegations against the accused, and added it could not show leniency to the accused for such a heinous crime. The court, after taking evidence on record, convicted the accused and imposed a fine on him.
