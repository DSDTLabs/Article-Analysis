NEW DELHI: National   ( ) chairperson   has played down the deferment of the watchdog’s re-accreditation by an agency affiliated to the Office of the   High Commissioner for Human Rights. “It’s a regular process which happens every five years. 

 The Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has asked us some questions to which we will reply soon,” Justice Dattu told TOI.
 
 Asked whether the SCA’s report in November, citing ‘political appointments’, ‘police officers in its investigation unit’ and ‘lack of pluralism in its staff ’, had led to the deferment, Justice Dattu said, “It’s not correct. It’s a routine process. Every five years, the re-accreditation process takes place, not just for us, but for many countries. This time it was to happen in November 2016 but it has been postponed to November 2017.”
 
 On political appointments and police officers in NHRC, Dattu said, “This (Protection of Human Rights) Act was framed in such a way. And anyway, six eminent people — including PM, Speaker,   deputy chairman, leaders of opposition in   and Rajya Sabha, and minister in-charge of human rights ministry are part of the committee selecting the chairperson and members of NHRC. We have to give due credit to their wisdom.”
 
 Section 3 (2) of Protection of Human Rights Act states that NHRC should consist of a chairperson who has been CJI, a member who has been a judge of the SC, one member who has been chief justice of a high court, and two members who are persons having knowledge of, or practical experience in, matters relating to human rights.
 
 The GANHRI sub-committee report has criticised the current selection process in the NHRC and said it was “not sufficiently broad and transparent”.
 
 The report further states that no women had been appointed to any positions on the governing body of the NHRC since 2004. It said of its 468 staff, only 92 (20%) were women.
