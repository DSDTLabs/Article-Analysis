Ludhiana: Having realized the need for good education especially in villages, a 47-year-old UK-based NRI and son of a former school headmaster has returned to his native Barudi village, 33 kms from Ludhiana, to support young children pursue their bigger dreams.

 Charan Kanwal Singh Sekhon, who is a senior environment officer of an agency with the UK government, had left the country and relocated in Bedford, UK, in 1995, while pursuing greener pastures.
 
 He had started Social Education Voluntary Association (Seva) Trust in Bedford in order to spread awareness on education and environment, health and wellbeing.
 
 Sekhon said, “Belonging to middle class, I had faced several hurdles during my youth days. It was not easy for any youngster to establish abroad, especially when he did not have proper guidance and resources. Therefore I want to become that guide and adviser to the students here in my country.”
 
 He said, “I want to support those youngsters who wish to study and succeed in life but lack financial resources. I have noticed that there is still a lot of discrimination on the basis of caste and religion which is unjustified.”
 
 Talking about his plans, Sekhon said he would rope in professors and lecturers for his project to groom students of his village.
 
 “I want the universities and IIT professors to share their knowledge with these students through online lectures. The students will be groomed and taught soft skills too,” he said.
 
 Sharing details about his trust, Charan Kanwal said the foundation works for awareness on education among Asian students, promotion of jobs for them in the public sector and holds yoga classes for Asian and UK natives.
