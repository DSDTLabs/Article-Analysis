 was in the news recently when his film  , which won the Hivos Tiger Award at the International Film Festival of Rotterdam faced the wrath of right wing activists for its title.

  The filmmaker has now decided to make a film based on his experiences, rising intolerance and suppression of artistic freedom. Actor-writer   will play the lead in the film. Sanal tells us, “It is going to be a political movie that speaks for the artistes in the contemporary world. It will deal with the way artistes are treated, the subjective approach to their works and how the names, content and actors are cross 
 examined.”
 
  Sanal adds that the movie will explore the equation between artists, government and the public. “Dealing with the government has become a herculean task. When the government has to please the public, they will naturally have to join the bandwagon. Hence, artistes find themselves at the receiving end,” he says. 
 
  Murali Gopy will be playing the artiste in the movie. “He will be seen as a filmmaker and the shoot will be held at Trivandrum in May. I haven’t decided the rest of the cast and crew, but some of the artistes from Sexy Durga and Ozhivudivasathe Kali will be seen in this film too,” Sanal says.
  On joining Sanal for his next, Murali Gopy says, “I have always been interested in being part of independent films. I am quite impressed by Sanal’s works, thoughts and his style of filmmaking. So when he approached me, I felt really glad to take 
 it up.”
