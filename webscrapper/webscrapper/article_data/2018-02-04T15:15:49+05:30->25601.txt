BHOPAL: Newborns in Bhopal’s   are being refused discharge without amandatory   registration of the baby by the parents.

 A directive by the hospital administration instructs its staff, ward in-charge and security guards not to allow newborns to leave the premises unless Aadhaar registration details of the babies are produced. “These instructions were put out at the time of my predecessor. I will look into the actual directive from the district administration and then comment,” hospital superintendent, Dr   told TOI. He took charge late last year.
 
 The district administration and hospital officials said that Aadhaar for newborns is optional. However, a computer operator and a hospital official said, “The orders are clear… without Aadhaar of the newborn, discharge slip will not be provided.”   collector   said, “Aadhaar cannot be linked with the discharge of a patient or a newborn.”
