HYDERABAD: After their strike in December cut no ice with either   or the government, the   and Owners Association (TCDOA) has now threatened to go begging on streets on Friday half-naked to show their angst.

 “As we did not get any response from either the government or taxi aggregators to our strike, we have decided to intensify it.On Friday , we will go half-naked and  . The very next day , we will cook on the streets to  ,“ said Shiva V , president of TCDOA.
 
 Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday , he said that the government had diverted the issue and taken the taxi aggregators' side in solving the problem. “Instead of standing by its people, the state government is supporting taxi aggregators. Even for the talks, they called all unions `irrelevant' and diverted the issue,“ he added.
 
 On New Year's Eve, cabbies in the city started a five-day strike against Ola and Uber. The unions had put forth a set of demands ranging from scrapping the cab-sharing system to stopping the cab-leasing scheme of aggregators.The main cab aggregators in the city are Ola cabs, Uber cabs, Meru cabs, Yellow cabs, Dot cabs, Sky cabs, and cabs run by IT companies. About 2,000 cabbies sat at Dharna Chowk demanding that Ola, Uber, and state government solve their problems.
 
 Later the strike was intensified with a fast-untodeath strike. On January 10, the strike was called off as cab drivers were facing financial crisis. At the time of calling off the strike, TCDOA said that they would take up the strike again, this time with a `proper' plan. The previous strike had crippled cab services in the city and despite several rounds of talks with Ola and Uber managers at the transport department's office, the deadlock continued for days.
