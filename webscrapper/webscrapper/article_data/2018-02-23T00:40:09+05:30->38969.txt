Coimbatore: Collector TN Hariharan on Thursday ordered the district rural development agency (DRDA) to form teams under nodal officers to inspect all the toilets constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission scheme in the district. DRDA project director Roopan Shankar Raj said, “We had conducted a survey in 2012-2013 to take stock of the number of households without a toilet. Before 2014, many households had constructed their own toilets. Not all of them availed the Central government scheme. But, all these toilets constructed under own funds have to be recorded now as touts and agents are trying to cheat the government. We have already begun a survey and will submit a complete report on this soon,” he told TOI. According to the Swachh Bharat Mission, the city has received nearly Rs 18cr under the mission in the last two years from the state and the centre to construct individual household toilets.  The teams will also visit villages and click photographs of all the toilets constructed under the scheme. “There are several discrepancies in photos uploaded to the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM)-Gramin website. Several people photographed in front of the toilets are not real owners. We will take these photographs again and approve them. We will geo-tag all these toilets with the right beneficiaries’ photos and upload them,” said a senior official. Meanwhile, all the officials involved in the K Madhapur village toilet scam are being investigated and action will be initiated against them, said Roopan. “Strict action will be taken against engineer Vellingiri, who cheated people stating they will get money for toilets constructed using own funds and the block co-ordinator Saravanan. Apart from this, all other officials including the block development officer, panchayat secretary and workers will be penalised,” he added.
