MUSSOORIE/DEHRADUN: News of the death of veteran actor   in Mumbai late on Friday night was met with grief in Dehradun — where he spent his formative years (in the hamlet of   on the outskirts of the city) and Mussoorie — where he was born and which he regarded as his hometown.

 Sanjay Mark, Alter's friend for over 50 years and his junior at   recalled how the actor was passionate and vocal about his love for the country as well as his hometown. “If anybody said anything to him against India or Mussoorie, he would get upset, and also make it known to them,” he said. Alter’s deep connection with Mussoorie was evident when he sat on a 12-hour protest in 2010 against the demolition of Mussoorie’s iconic Clock Tower terming it “the death of an old friend”.
 
 Veteran Dehradun-based journalist Raj Kanwar who knew him for several years said one of Alter’s most cherished wish was to produce and direct movies that would be entirely shot in the twin cities of Dehradun and Mussoorie.
 
 “Although he had achieved great fame and name, his heart essentially lay in Dehradun and Mussoorie.”
 
 Roop Chand, convener of the Mussoorie Sports Association, whose elder brother was Alter’s close friend, recalled that it was the actor’s dream to have a full marathon in Mussoorie. “He told me he had collected Rs 4 lakh and will collect another 5 lakh needed for the full marathon. He was a true sportsman and sports lover.”
 
 At the time of his death, Alter was working on a film based on his first novel, ‘Rerun At Rialto,’ a thriller set in Mussoorie. In fact, according to Arora, the actor was planning to shift base completely from Mumbai. “He had big plans for the Christian Retreat Centre at Rajpur which his parents had established.
 
 He was keen on activities that would boost the literary and cultural development of the  . However, God had other plans.”
