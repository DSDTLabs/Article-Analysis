I am not voicing my concern here as an actress, but as a lay person. I will only speak for myself when I say that   for the right person, who will make a difference. I feel that as voters, we must be discerning and choose the person who delivers as a leader and works responsibly. We do not need someone who fails to live up to their promises. We’ve seen times where we get an intimation that a leader is visiting our area and hence the roads are suddenly done up and everything looks proper. These short-term remedies are not what we should be looking at. 
This is where I say that apart from the voters, the onus also lies equally on the leaders. As voters, we don’t want the moon and the stars, we only ask the   to keep their promises. I request them not to make any lofty promises that they cannot fulfil. We want leaders who ‘think’ that they can make a change to be the change, do the change and bring the change. I am not an ardent follower of politics, but when it comes to choosing a responsible leader, this is all I ask - please deliver what you promised.
