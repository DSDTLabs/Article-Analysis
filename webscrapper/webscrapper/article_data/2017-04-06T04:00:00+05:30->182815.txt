Vadodara: Until some years ago, Barodians used to speed off to their favourite destinations in their cars or motorbikes during weekends. But if you visit some getaways now, you will find a number of bicycles parked at the spot next to the cars. From youngsters to professionals, citizens have taken to leisure as well as long distance cycling over last few years. And the number of cyclists is going up steadily with every passing day. 

 “Cycling more popular among those in their 30s and 40s now. We started promoting cycling for health benefits but it is also pursued as a fun activity. People prefer to take leisure ride to the destinations outside the city, enjoy the day and ride back by evening,” said Raghvendrasingh Jhala of Cycling Club of Baroda. “Those who have got hooked on to biking have even rode over 1,000 km. Some even use such outings for networking,” he added. 
 
 Another cyclist, Nikita Lalwani, who runs Cycling Cities club , said, “Many regular cyclists don’t mind investing good money in cycles. From mountain bikes to long distance road bikes, a variety of cycles are available and it is a good motivation for those wanting to take up regular cycling.” Lalwani said
 
 “There are many who don’t want to buy costly bikes so I offer them cycle on rent as well. Many amateurs take cycles on rent for a month or more,” she added.
 
 Sameer Gaikwad, who has cycled to as far as Mumbai, said, “Till a couple of years ago, cycling even to the periphery of the city was a big achievement. But now most Barodians have developed endurance and they easily ride up to 50 km on weekends. It’s a best non-impact sport apart from offering leisure time for families and friends. Also, cycling is environment friendly.”
