GREATER NOIDA: UP Congress spokesperson   quit his party on Sunday and joined   in the presence of state president Keshav Prasad Maurya in Lucknow. The move is likely to change the political equations in Jewar assembly constituency where Singh has a sound network.

 This is the second time in the recent years when a Congress leader joined BJP ahead of the polls. In 2014, Congress candidate from Gautam Budh Nagar, Ramesh Chand Tomar, joined BJP just a week before the elections. This led to a massive win for BJP candidate Mahesh Sharma. The Congress, however, claimed Singh’s exit will have no impact as their voters are loyal to the party.
 
 Singh told TOI that he was dissatisfied with the functioning of Congress leaders and hence put in his papers. Singh, a resident of Rabupura area, had been associated with the party for 30 years. He came to limelight during the land acquisition of Bhatta Parsaul when he took Congress vice-president   from Pari Chowk to the village on his bike and led a massive protest.
 
 He was elected as chairman of Nagar Nigam, Rabupura, Greater Noida in 2001.
 
 Singh had contested the 2012 assembly polls from Jewar constituency and bagged 59,000 votes. However, he lost to BSP’s   by a margin of 9,500 votes. 
 
 Singh addressed his resignation letter to Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “For the past few years, some Congress leaders have worked in a different fashion which is not good. I feel this is not a good sign for the party. A party which ignores people’s sentiment and maintain a distance from them, can’t do anything good for people,” he said.
