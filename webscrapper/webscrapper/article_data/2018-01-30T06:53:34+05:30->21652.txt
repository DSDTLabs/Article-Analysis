AHMEDABAD: Even as the   is scheduled to take place in   in February after a long hiatus since 1992, an NGO involved in   — after its survey which concluded last week, reported, “there is a very fair probability of the presence of tiger or tigress along with two cubs the region of Dang in south Gujarat.”

 The findings along with statement of locals has been sent to PCCF Gujarat and   (NTCA). Jalpesh Mehta, the chairman of the foundation said, “There has been increased sightings in the last 1.5 years with locals saying tiger sightings happen within a range of one week to four months.”
 
 “Two years ago, there were no such sightings,” Mehta said.
 
  
  The forest department, however, is sceptical of the report. G K Sinha, principal chief conservator of forests said, “We have requested NTCA to carry out the census scheduled in February. The census will be conducted following all protocols required of a tiger census and the only after that will the department get a real picture.” 
 
 Sinha added, “Three officials have already been trained for the census.”
 
 The report by the NGO further mentioned that locals were able to identify broadly the sizes of three animals and prima facie there is no confusion whether the sightings were of leopards and not tigers. Some locals said tigers have been present in the area for ages, though even till two years ago, there were almost no sightings of the big cat.
 
 The report submitted to PCCF and NTCA further states that the tribals are well aware of the difference between a tiger and a leopard. They have acknowledged tiger sightings for last 1-2 years and were able to show the size of the animal by their hands the report mentioned.
