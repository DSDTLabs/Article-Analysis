CHANDIGARH:   on Friday said it was open to an out-of-court settlement in the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal dispute, but   stuck to its stand that all previous agreements must be honoured.

 Punjab CM Captain   sought an out-ofcourt settlement during a meeting with Union home minister   and Haryana chief minister   during the Northern Zonal Council meeting here.
 
 In the evening, Haryana agriculture minister OP Dhankar, who was present at the meeting, said Khattar made it clear that there was no question of any dialogue on the dispute as Haryana’s execution petition was listed for hearing in the Supreme Court in July.
 
 Dhankar issued a statement while reacting to a press release issued by Amarinder’s office. The Haryana minister called the Punjab government’s press note “misleading and incorrect”.
 
 According to the press note issued by the Punjab government,   and Khattar had agreed for “a feasible solution for optimal utilization of river waters based on internationally accepted riparian principles”. Neither government shared the modalities for an out-of-court settlement.
