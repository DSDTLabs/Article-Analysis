Actress   has said her scariest experience of making the new 'The Rings' film was seeing her own dummy. 

 This is the third installment in the   remakes of 'The Ring' and the 27 year old star said she found her life-sized dummy creepy.
 
 "I think the scariest thing I've witnessed is my dummy. They made a full, life-size cast dummy of myself and it was really creepy. Its creator   (Tuiten, special makeup effects designer) is so amazing, and so wonderfully detailed with everything," Teegarden said. 
 
 'The Rings' follows more than a decade on from 'The Ring', which was a remake of the cult Japanese favourite 'Ring', starring   and released in 2002.
