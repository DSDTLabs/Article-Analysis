LUCKNOW: Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar defended the sacked   (AIMPLB) executive member, Maulana Salman Husaini  , and urged not to call him a ‘Ram Bhakt’, saying that this would only create obstructions in the cleric’s service to humanity. 

 Tweeting from his official account on Monday, Sri Sri said no obstacles should be created in Nadwi’s. The tweet, in Hindi, read, “It is my humble request to the media to not call   a ‘Ram Bhakt’ and create obstacles in his way. He is working for humanity, try to understand this.” Nadwi had claimed he believed the issue could be resolved with talks within just three months. 
 
 A day after being sacked, Nadwi held a meeting with his aides in Lucknow on Monday to decide the future course of action. Consequently, it was decided that the meeting of Sri Sri with seers and clerics in Ayodhya on February 20, be postponed to March 12.
