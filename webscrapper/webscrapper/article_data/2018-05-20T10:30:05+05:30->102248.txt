CHANDIGARH: Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal on Saturday attacked the   government for turning down the Central government’s health insurance scheme.

 “The Modi government has started a Rs 5 lakh per family health insurance for 50 crore people but strangely the Punjab government has rejected it and is implementing a scheme that offers a medical cover of only Rs 50,000,” Harsimrat said, adding that financial burden of the   were to be borne by the Central government and the states on a 60:40 ratio, respectively. But, she added, the Punjab government has run away from implementing the scheme by claiming it would be an additional burden on the state exchequer.
 
 She said the Congress government always talked about empty treasuries whenever it was tasked with doing public good. “The state government apparently has enough money for renovating ministerial bungalows and purchasing luxurious vehicles, but no money for a medical insurance scheme for the poor,” said Harsimrat.
 
 The Union minister added that farmers were committing suicide in the state due to non-fulfilment of chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s loan waiver promise and the youth felt betrayed as they were not being given promised jobs.
