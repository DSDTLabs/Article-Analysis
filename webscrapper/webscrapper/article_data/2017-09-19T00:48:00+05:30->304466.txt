Mangaluru: The search for the body of an engineering student, who was feared drowned on Sunday at Kodikkal-Chitrapura, was deferred on Monday due to rough sea conditions.

 Police said they could not launch an operation as the sea was rough.
 
 Fishermen, who are conversant with local situation, said in such situations, they have a general idea as to where the body can be found. They then spread nets in such an area and recover the body. They said they will wait some more time for the sea to calm down and then launch the search operation. However, if the sea continues to be rough, the only option is to wait for the body to be washed ashore.
 
 The victim, Sahicharan, 20, hailing from Tirupathi in Andhra Pradesh, studying engineering in a Bengaluru college, had arrived in the city along with his three friends on Sunday morning.
 
 At around 4.30 pm, turbulent waves swept Sahicharan away while he was inside the waters. His friends and those at the beach could not rescue him. A missing complaint had been filed.
 
 Police said Sahicharanâ€™s parents have reached the city.
