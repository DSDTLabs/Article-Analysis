MUMBAI: Hostel rent at the premier   has shot up 300% this year. From Rs 500 per semester, the rent has gone up to Rs 2,000. The mess advance paid by students has gone up 33%, while the fees under heads such as examination, registration and medical, has seen a 100% hike. Though the premier institute hiked the rents after almost 20 years, students claimed that they were not consulted before the hikes were implemented.

 While undergraduate students are already reeling under a two-fold tuition fee hike implemented last year, this hike has left them shocked. “Students from reserved categories are worst affected as the overall hike is around 24%. They get an exemption in tuition fees, but not for hostel facilities,” said a student. The gym fees went up 170%, while mess advance was raised from Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000. 
 
 Institute officials said the hikes were implemented after a long time. “Around 200 man hours have been spent on deciding rational the fee hikes,” said dean of students’ welfare,  . “The hostel rent was revised in 1997. While the gym fees, registration and medical fees were revised in 2011. We hiked medical fees, but the insurance cover too has been doubled from Rs 1 lakh to 2 lakh,” he said.
