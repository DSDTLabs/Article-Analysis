KOLHAPUR: Fuel station owners from across district are going to stop procurement of petrol and diesel from the oil firms on Wednesday. 

 The operators have taken this decision after firms failed to keep the promise to revise the commission as per the recommendations of   committee appointed by the central government in 2010.
 
 Gajkumar Mangave, district president of the association, said, "Despite several rounds of talks, oil   are yet to implement the recommendations of the committee. According to the commission, we should get the commission based on the retail sale price instead of present system of fixed commission for every litre sold in the market. We have enough stock with us and the pumps will not shut even on Thursday. Therefore, citizens should not worry."
 
 Over 4,500 petrol pump owners will participate in the agitation. The oil firms had given written assurance that recommendations will be implemented from December last year. Mangave claims that the firms delayed the implementation citing demonetisation. "We will resort to one-shift sales during the day in the city to reduce management expenses if oil firms fail to accept our demand. The petrol pumps along the highways will operate at night. The one-shift sales will start from May 15, while weekly holidays for pumps on Sundays will begin from May 14," said Mangave.
 
 The Apurva Chandra committee's recommendations includes fixing the stock loss on petrol at 0.75%, charging for   and toilet facilities at fuel pumps, fixing dealer margin on the product's price and reviewing the commission every six months. The petroleum ministry accepted these and asked the oil firms to implement it.
