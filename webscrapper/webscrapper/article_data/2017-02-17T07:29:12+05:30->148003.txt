HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad high court has held that district collectors can sack sarpanches without conducting any inquiry if allegations of corruption and misconduct are levelled against them. All the collectors are required to do is seek an explanation.

 The bench of Acting Chief Justice   and Justice   pronounced this judgement while disposing of an appeal filed by one Middela   , who was seeking the sacking of K Mangamma, the sarpanch of Bowrampet gram panchayat in   mandal of Medchal district near Hyderabad.
 
 After she was removed from the Sarpanch's post earlier, Mangamma had challenged the same in court charging the district collector of not ordering a probe into the allegations. She contended that the allegations were baseless and were being done at the behest of their Upa Sarpanch. Hence, a single judge, by way of an interim order, suspended the district collector's order. Against this interim order, the current appeal was filed.
 
 The current bench made it clear that it is not going into the merits of the case. It said that under section 249 (1) of the Panchayat Raj Act, there is no provision to conduct an enquiry .In the current case, the formality was fulfilled as she furnished an explanation, the bench said. Appearing for the Sarpanch, senior counsel S   alleged that the Upa sarpanch, who is now a TRS leader, has been openly claiming that he will not allow the lady sarpanch to perform her duties as she is a Dalit and as the Upa sarpanch belongs to ruling party .
 
 The bench said that it is only intervening because it found the single judge did not give the authorities a chance to explain their case. It referred the matter back to the single judge.
