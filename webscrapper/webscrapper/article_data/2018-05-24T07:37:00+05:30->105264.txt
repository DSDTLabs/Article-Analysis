Ludhiana: The police, on Wednesday, arrested four people for attacking municipal corporation executive engineer Karamjit Singh during a drive to vacate illegally occupied flats in Giaspura. 

 Pandu, Mohammad Tahir, Bittu Puncture and Sonu, all residents of Giaspura, have been charged with attempt to murder. 
 
 On May 17, the municipal corporation officials went to Giaspura to get flats vacated from encroachers. But the team came under attack, with some of the residents pelting it with stones. A mob thrashed executive engineer Karamjit Singh when a 19-year-old youth, Sunny, climbed a transformer and received an electric shock. 
 
 On the complaint of the executive engineer, the police had registered a case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) of the IPC. 
 
 “I was trying to convince the protesters not to interfere in the drive. During the melee, Sunny climbed the transformer and threatened to commit suicide. As he touched an electricity wire, a shock threw him down. Soon, the mob attacked my team and me and damaged our car. Police came to my rescue as one of them tried to attack me with a sharp-edged weapon,” said the MC official.
