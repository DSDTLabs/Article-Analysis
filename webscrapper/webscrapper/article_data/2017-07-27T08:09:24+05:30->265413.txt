 Inspector Anil Ade of Kranti Chowk police station said a team of traffic policemen were engaged in enforcing the helmet drive, when they spotted the duo passing through the intersection without helmet.
 
 Ade said head constable Aslam Shah Yaqub Shah blew a whistle at them, asking them to stop, but they did not pay any heed. Consequently, they were forcibly intercepted and asked to pay penalty for not wearing helmet.

 Other policemen present at the scene separated the father-son duo from Shah and took them to the Kranti Chowk police station in a police vehicle. Shas lodged a formal complaint against them and a case has been registered against the suspects for using criminal force to deter a government employee from performing his official duty.
 
 The suspects have been identified as Majid (25) and his father Zafar Khan (50), both residents of Baijipura area.
