Producer Deepak Bandekar feels he was fortunate to land “We were lucky to sign Hrishitaa. We met her at the right time and she was excited to work on a complex film like 'Ishq Tera'. Our film has suspense, drama and true love. I feel Hrishitaa has been phenomenal in the film, especially when she oscillates between her two alternate characters. The rest of the cast, like Mohit Madaan (her husband), Mozhgan Taraneh (her doctor), Manoj Pawha (her Boss), Aman Verma (doctor) and Shahbaz Khan (her father) have also contributed to the film in their own inimitable ways. The film also has a good soundtrack featuring talents like Sonu Nigam, Shreya Ghoshal, Sunidhi Chauhan and Siddharth Mahadevan.” Describing her role further, Bandekar adds, “This story is about a person who goes through identity crisis and split personalities, developed from incidents in her childhood and has no knowledge of how this happens to her, and why.
