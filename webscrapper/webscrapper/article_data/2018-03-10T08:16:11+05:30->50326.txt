CHANDIGARH: Chandigarh   (CHB) has directed owners of its flats to   charges imposed for building violations before March 31. So far, 750 allottees have already deposited the charges.

 Once the money is paid, CHB said, the notices issued over misuse, violation, and encroachment will be withdrawn until further orders. Over the years, city residents have been urging the administration to allow changes to meet growing needs. The owners of CHB dwelling units are facing notices as they have made changes in their properties in violation of norms.
 
 
 CHB has developed housing schemes in different sectors, including 29, 41, 40, 44, 43, 45, 47, 38 (west) and Modern Housing Complex, with around 64,000 units. The board has also developed rehabilitation housing schemes.
 
 
 According to CHB officials, the board has allowed need-based changes from time to time, subject to conditions. “There are many allottees who have already   rooms in their dwelling units. These don not fulfill conditions mentioned in need-based changes orders, so these cannot be regularized,” said the official.
 
 
 “Many of the allottees have constructed chajjas/cantilevers/balconies outside the plotted area, which are projecting over government land. Such allottees are approaching CHB for regularization of the same as the construction was done by them many years ago and any modification to such construction is not feasible at this stage,” added the official.
 
 
 The official said that a rebate has been allowed to the allottees, who will deposit the penal charge on or before March 31, 2018, on basis of self-certification.
