LUCKNOW : No more queuing up at government offices, or struggling due to the slow speed of government mobile apps while registering a complaint. One would soon have single window access to all earlier applications launched by the state government and agencies, thereby saving both time and money. 

 Under the Smart City Mission (SCM), the Lucknow   (LMC) will soon launch an app suite, under which there will be a single window gateway to government apps ranging from online lodging of FIR, calling up emergency services, complaints related to infrastructure, electricity, information about the status of housing projects etc.
 
  
 
 There are more than 40 government apps being used in the state at present. The LMC has already given the contract to build this app suite to an Ahmedabad based company.
 
 
 The app is likely to be ready for public use in two months. A senior   said, “Though the integration of all apps on one platform will take just about two weeks, the company has to prepare its supporting system too like registering of complaints, monitoring of public interface, supervision of the activities etc which may extend up to two months.”
 
 
 The file has been sent to the mayor for approval. After the first version is ready, the company will hand it over to the LMC for trials and further corrections and additions in features, if required. After LMC’s   gives it a go-ahead, it will be launched for public. “In any case, the app will be ready for public use by May,” said the officials.
 
 
 Since SCM integrates all government departments, one can access all facilities like traffic, police, street lights, water supply, waste management, medical, city transport and electricity through one gateway.
 
 
 One will not have to take the pain to download different apps for different departments. The LMC has allocated around Rs8 crore for developing this app.
