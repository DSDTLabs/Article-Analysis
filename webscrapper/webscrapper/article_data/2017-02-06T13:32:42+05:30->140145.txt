Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk reiterated on Sunday that he would continue to attend meetings of President Donald Trump's business council as this would give him a chance to try and influence policies that he disagreed with.   "At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost," Musk tweeted on Sunday. "In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong," he said in another tweet.    Ahead of Friday's meting of the council, Musk had issued a statement, saying, "...I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy. Advisory councils simply provide advice and attending does not mean that I agree with actions by the administration."
