HYDERABAD: The ' ' and ' ' schemes, through which 1,800 crore have been disbursed so far, have helped prevent child marriages in Telangana. The Centre also showed interest and might implement it at national level. 

 Kalyana Lakshmi scheme was launched on October 2, 2014 and till date three lakh families have benefited from the financial assistance provided to the bride's family to meet marriage expenses. "Other than monetary assistance to the poor, we have also been able to prevent child marriages, which is also the purpose of the scheme," special secretary in Chief Minister's Office, K   told TOI. 
 
 A girl over 18 years of age belonging to SC/ST community with annual income of parents below 2 lakh is eligible for the scheme. Before sanctioning the amount, officials verify the age through records. "Families wait for the girl to turn 18 to avail assistance," added Bhoopal. 
 
 There is no annual budgetary limit for the scheme as it comes under a 'green channel'.

Each girl from the family is eligible for the financial assistance. In 2016-17, BCs and EBCs were also included in the beneficiary list.
