PILIBHIT: The chief minister’s office has instructed the divisional forest officer (DFO) of   (PTR) to address a complaint regarding illegal encroachment and collection of forest produce from the core area of PTR.
 
  Lucknow-based wildlife enthusiast,   had first registered a complaint in the matter with the CM’s grievance redressal portal on February 13 this year. Later on March 23, he again filed a complaint with the CM’s helpline, this time demanding a CBI inquiry into the matter.
  
  “I had complained about the illegal collection of aromatic herbs and khus grass from compartment number 72 of PTR’s   forest range by a group of scent manufacturers from Kannauj in collusion with PTR officials. I also raised this matter with the principal chief conservator of forest, SK Upadhyay,” Singh said, adding that he demanded a CBI probe after the state administration did not take any action into the matter.
  
  The wildlife enthusiast further said that in case if action is still not taken, he will file a PIL in the matter in the high court. “How can they refer the matter to the DFO when he is one of the accused in the case? These illegal activities disturb the tiger habitat which eventually leads to a rise in man-animal conflict. In Pilibhit, 24 people have been killed in tiger attacks.”
  
  Meanwhile, DFO   said that he hasn’t received any communication from the CMO so far and will follow their instructions in the case.
