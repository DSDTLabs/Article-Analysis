ROUND ROCK: The suspect in the deadly bombings that terrorised Austin blew himself up on Wednesday as authorities closed in on him, bringing an end to a three-week manhunt. But police warned that more bombs could be out there.

 
 The suspect’s motive remained a mystery, along with whether he acted alone in the five bombings in the Texas capital and suburban   that killed two people and wounded four others.
 
 
 Police zeroed in on the man in the last 24 to 36 hours and located his vehicle at a hotel in Round Rock.
 
 Officers were waiting for armored vehicles to arrive before moving in for an arrest when his car began to drive away, police chief Brian Manley said. Authorities followed the vehicle, which ran into a ditch on the side of the road, he said. When members of the SWAT team approached, the suspect detonated an explosive device inside the vehicle, he said. The blast knocked one officer back, and a second officer fired his weapon, Manley said. The suspect was identified as  , of Pflugerville, Texas, according to the local CBS television affiliate and Austin American-Statesman newspaper, citing unnamed law enforcement sources.
 
 Public records showed Conditt’s age as 23. Officials had said the suspect was 24. He was unemployed.
