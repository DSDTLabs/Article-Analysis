Bollywood actress   is busy promoting her upcoming movie, Veere Di Wedding in full swing. The actress was spotted yesterday at the Mumbai airport, right after wooing us with her ripped denim sari look. Post that, she quickly changed into a printed crop top and maxi skirt, from Huda Al Nuaimi, a Dubai-based fashion label. 

 
 She completed this look with a Bottega Veneta handbag, a pair of black sunnies and black comfy loafers. What caught our attention was the trunk-esque suitcase. Turns out, it's no ordinary suitcase and is from a luxe Indian brand, Trunks Company. The suitcase is handcrafted in leather, which is embellished with brass hardware and the brand's signature wood trim. The regal-looking trunk comes with four wheels and a trolley, making it easy to carry.
 
 
  
 
 The brand also offers bespoke services to its clients and boasts of a huge clientele of Indian royal families and celebrities. In just a couple of years, the brand has emerged as India's leading malletiers. Embodying the yester glory of luggage cases with a modern touch, the brand is also getting a lot of attention internationally too. The tan Cabin Suitcase carried by Sonam costs around Rs. 95,000 approx. Just like every time, she introduced us to a cool look, this time she made us eye her stylish travel trunk!
