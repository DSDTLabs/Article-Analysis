VISAKHAPATNAM: The once beautiful, popular   may soon end up having a drainage pipeline leading directly to the sea. While tourism department officials said that the pipeline was meant to drain rainwater and not untreated waste, activists claimed that all evidence was to the contrary. 

 Environment activist   said, "An AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) engineer said that the pipes were meant for rain/stormwater drainage and not for untreated waste. But if it is for stormwater drain, then building them on either side of the road would have served the purpose. Where was the need to build pipelines leading from eateries and toilets towards the sea?"
 
 Melville Smythe, a surfing coach on Rushikonda beach who works with the   of  , said, "It is definitely not meant to carry rainwater. Even when rain falls on the muddy ground full of litter it turns dirty. There are so many eateries and toilets surrounding the beach and these are situated at a higher level. A septic tank has also been built in front of an eatery close to the beach."
 
 APTDC executive engineer  , however, assured that the pipe was not meant to discharge any sewerage water or solid waste. "There is water stagnation at the beach entrance and parking lot. So, to counter it, we needed to drain the rainwater into the sea. Covered manholes and meshes would ensure that no solid waste is allowed to flow to the sea. The pipeline would also be concealed," he told TOI.
 
 Apart from the pipeline, the whole beach nowadays resembles a market yard with stalls and push carts all over the place. And despite the "beach development" that's been on for years, the area is littered with discarded coconut shells, corn cobs, leftover food even as cattle and dogs roam freely. 
 
 "Earlier, foreigners used to come to this beach to learn surfing and look around the place which has hills and sea on either side. But with the beach turning filthier, they have gradually stopped coming," Smythe said.
