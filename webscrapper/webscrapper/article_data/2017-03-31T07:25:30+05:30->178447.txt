AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday reserved its order on a plea seeking death compensation in the Sadiq Jamal Mehtar encounter case, as the state government insisted that as custodial death has not been established, there is no point is granting compensation at this stage.

 Sadiq’s father sought directions from the   to the state government, to pay Rs 50 lakh compensation for killing his son illegally, in police custody. Appearing for the state government, additional advocate general Prakash Jani submitted that the CBI has filed a chargesheet in this case and the trial has not yet begun. If granted compensation without the cops being held guilty, the action would adversely affect the outcome of the trial, Jani said.
 
 Rebutting the state government’s argument, that this is not the right stage to provide compensation, the petitioner’s advocate S H Iyer cited the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter case, in which the state government paid compensation of Rs 10 lakh much before chargesheets were filed.
 
 Advocate Iyer quoted 12 different judgments passed by the   and various high courts to drive home his point that since the state has accused the cops of committing a custodial killing, it is up to the state government to prosecute the accused and secure their conviction. In all related judgments, compensation was awarded in custodial deaths and fake encounter cases at the stage when the investigation was ordered. After hearing the arguments from both sides, Justice   reserved his order on the issue.
 
 Sadiq was killed, in an alleged shootout, on Jaunary 13, 2003 in Naroda. After his death, the cops dubbed him a terrorist who was out to kill   at the behest of Pakistan-based terror outfits, in order to avenge the 2002 riots.
