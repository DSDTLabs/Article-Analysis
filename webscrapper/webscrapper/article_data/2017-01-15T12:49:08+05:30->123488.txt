INDORE: The   at Jhabua, whose 80-year-old mother was found chained in the balcony in the biting cold on Friday, was transferred to police lines by Jhabua superintendent of police on Saturday.

 The incident took place on Friday when Jhabua police received a video of a woman who was chained in her own home in the balcony by her son Madan Verma who was a head constable in the department.
 
 An enquiry was ordered in the matter and Jhabua police station in-charge RS   reached the house of the accused at the   lines.
 
 “We found that the woman was leashed to a chain and she was sleeping on a bed which was in an open area,” said Bhaskare while speaking to the media here on Saturday.
 
 Following this the accused head constable was summoned by SP Mahesh Chandra Jain where he claimed that his mother was not mentally stable and had on many instances removed her clothes in public and so they kept her in restraints in the house.
 
 “He said that since he did not want her to venture out of the house, he had chained her. The accused head constable has been line attached and we are investigating the case further. We have also warned the constable of dire consequences if the action was repeated,” Mahesh Chandra Jain, Jhabua SP told TOI.
 
 It also came to light that the woman’s second son,  , an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) lives in the house close by.
 
 He was a mute spectator to the entire crime and did not raise any objections against his brother.
 
 Jhabua locals claimed that the woman was chained in such a way so that she could move around some distance and use the toilet.
