HYDERABAD: The government will not tolerate pollution of lakes and tanks and will take action against those destroying the water bodies, municipal administration minister   said on Monday. He was speaking after a surprise inspection of   lake in  , where he ordered an immediate probe against the local village secretary for issuing occupancy certificates for five buildings constructed on the tank bed. 

 Rama Rao instructed the local revenue divisional officer to probe the issue and suspend the village secretary. He also ordered a survey of the lake and removal of any structure that has encroached on the lake bed. The minister said the government will take this lake up for revival and clean it up by preventing further pollution. This, along with the beautification of the lake environs, will be done in the next one year, he added. The local member of parliament   will adopt the lake and organise a local working group with the area MLA  , officials and residents to oversee the revival and beautification of the Neknampur lake.
 
 A three-stage programme, preventing further pollution, cleaning up the water body and then its beautification, will be part of the government efforts to revive all tanks and lakes in the city, the minister added.
