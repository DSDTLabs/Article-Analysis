Mohali: Residents have lodged a complaint with deputy mayor Manjit Singh Sethi about wild growth and   in Mohali. Taking cognizance of the complaints, Sethi shot off a letter to MC commissioner Sandeep Hans on Friday.

 In his letter, Sethi raised the issue of Mohali marred with wild growth in vacant plots, open areas and on road berms. Blaming the company engaged for cleaning the city for the mess, Sethi said the overall situation of Mohali city is pitiable.
 
 In his letter, Sethi also said the condition especially in Wards 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, Phase 3B1 and 3BII markets is pathetic. Garbage heaps can be spotted along roadsides, on turnings and even outside houses on inner roads.
 
 Sethi said, “The company engaged to clean the city is not performing its duties properly. Wild growth in many sectors has grown over 10 feet in height and has become an haven for miscreants. Residents living near such places are vulnerable to activities of anti-social elements. Otherwise, bushes also give a shabby look to the city and can give rise to mosquitoes and allergies.”
 
 A long stretch of vacant land along NIPER road in Sector 68 has the maximum wild growth, which poses major threat to residents living in the vicinity.
 
 Gaggan Sharma, a resident of Sector 68, said these sectors are battling neglect as neither GMADA, nor Mohali municipal corporation has shown any concern over the matter. “Irregular lifting of waste also adds to problems of residents,” he said.
 
 The condition of internal roads in Sector 68 is pathetic. Potholed roads make driving difficult in the sector. Besides, wild growth in greenbelts prevents residents go out for a walk.
 
 Harish Singh of Phase 3B1 said these sectors lacked security and people dread venturing out in the night.
