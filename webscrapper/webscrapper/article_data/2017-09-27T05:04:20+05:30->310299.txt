MUMBAI: BMC’s A ward, which covers Colaba, Cuffe Parade, Nariman Point, Churchgate and Fort, will hold a   on Thursday for all restaurants in the area to discuss ways to treat waste. This comes close on heels of the October 2 deadline from when   has decided not to collect   from properties which generate over 100 kg of waste a day. 

 Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of A ward, said, “We also plan to rope in vendors to present the technologies available in the market to treat waste.”
