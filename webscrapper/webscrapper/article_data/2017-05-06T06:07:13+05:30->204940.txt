BHUBANESWAR: BJD president and chief minister   on Friday ruled out the allegations levelled by Kendrapada MP   that a conspiracy is being hatched in the party to oust some leaders. "I don't think that (Panda's remark) is at all correct," Naveensaid when asked for his reaction to Baijayant's statement.

 On Thursday, while welcoming Naveen's decision to open the doors for a possible return of some of the expelled or suspended leaders to the party, Baijayant had said: "Some efficient leaders had earlier left the party due to the conspiracy. Currently, a conspiracy is also being hatched to oust some leaders." 
 
 He, though, stayed silent when asked about the leaders who have been conspiring. 
 
 Several BJD leaders also joined Naveen to criticize Panda for such a statement in public. BJD vice-president   said it would have been better had Baijyant Panda spoken to the chief minister directly instead of making such baseless comments in the media. 
 
 "Baijayant is a senior member of our party. A few days back the chief minister had asked senior leaders to directly approach him instead of going to the media. If they continue to speak to the media, it sends a very wrong signal to the party workers. He should understand it," Patro said while refuting allegations of a conspiracy in the party.
 
 Baijayant's colleague in   and party spokesperson Kalikesh Singhdeo also ruled out the conspiracy theory. "The chief minister is well aware of all activities and there is no one in   who can mislead him on any subject," Kalikesh said. 
 
 The Balangir MP said as per his knowledge, there is no such conspiracy in the party. When contacted, senior cabinet minister   said Baijayant may have been aware of a conspiracy due to which he had made such a statement. "What should I say on that?" he asked.
 
 This is not the first occasion Baijayant has ruffled the feathers within the party.
