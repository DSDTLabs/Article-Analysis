DEHRADUN: A man in Kotdwar in   allegedly murdered his 35-year-old wife by stabbing her multiple times with   after she refused to make   for him on Tuesday.
 
  According to police, 38-year-old Sangeet Singh Negi, a resident of Kashirampur village in Kotdwar, got angry when his wife Aarti did not make tea for him in the morning.
  
  “The couple had a heated argument after the wife’s refusal to make tea. Negi locked the door of their bedroom from inside and picked up a pair of scissors kept on the table nearby and stabbed his wife mercilessly until she died,” said senior superintendent of police (SSP) Pauri, Mukhtar Mohsin.
  
  Hearing Aarti’s cries for help, the couple’s two children - an 11-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter - who were in another room, also started screaming.
  
  The neighbours heard the screams and rushed towards the house where they found Aarti lying in a pool of blood.
  
  “The neighbours informed police and a team of cops took the woman to the hospital where she was brought dead,” said Mohsin. The body has been sent for post-mortem.
  
  The husband was arrested later in the day while he was trying to flee. “Negi has been booked for   under section 302 of the IPC,” Mohsin added.
  
  Uttam Singh Jimiwal, in charge of Kotdwar police station, said, “The couple, which had been married for 13 years, did not share a cordial martial relationship and fought frequently. Negi would beat his wife often. Aarti had filed a complaint of domestic violence against her husband in December.”
  
  Jimiwal added, “The relationship soured after Aarti started working as a domestic help. Negi was unemployed. He also suspected her of having extramarital affairs.
