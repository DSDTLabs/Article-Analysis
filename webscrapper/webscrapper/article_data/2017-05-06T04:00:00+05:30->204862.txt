Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is planning to come up with a tennis court at Akota Stadium in the western part of the city.

 A proposal put up in this regard before the standing committee of the civic body states that the tennis court will be a state-of-the-art one like the one at Manjalpur sports complex. Besides citizens, it would also be fit for use for competitions. The civic body had earmarked funds for the project in its annual budget. It will spend Rs 79lakh on laying the court.
