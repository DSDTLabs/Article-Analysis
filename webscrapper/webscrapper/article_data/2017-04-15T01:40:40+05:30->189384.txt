NEW DELHI: Jawaharlal Nehru University students on Friday disrupted the inauguration programme of the university library on Friday. 

 JNU decided to name its central library after BR Ambedkar on his 126th jayanti. The protesters alleged that   Prakash Javadekar was the original guest of honour but didn’t turn up as he was scared of answering their questions. 
 
 Librarian Ramesh Gaur, however, clarified that Javadekar’s name was put on the first invitation card by mistake and that he was only supposed to address the gathering via video-conferencing. “Later, we came to know that he was busy in Nagpur and would send a pre-recorded message,” Gaur said.
 
 In his video address, Javadekar praised the decision to name the library after Ambedkar. “All the money is spent by the poor of the society for your education and you are indebted to them. Wherever you go and whatever career you pursue, always work for the poor to pay off your debt,” the minister told students. 
 
 VC M Jagadesh Kumar claimed it was his idea to rename the library. He said JNU would look towards applied science and start a school of engineering, and another on management and entrepreneurship. He thanked the guest of honour and founding chairman of DICCI, Milind Kamble, for his assistance. 
 
 Kamble’s speech was, however, drowned by slogans of the protesting students. 
 
 ABVP slammed the protesters and alleged that “they do not respect the memory of Ambedkar and oppose the naming of the library after him”. But JNUSU said they welcomed the renaming but not the “ministry’s decision of shutting the doors of JNU for hundreds of students”.
 
 The library has a renovated hall and a new reading room that can accommodate 100 students.
