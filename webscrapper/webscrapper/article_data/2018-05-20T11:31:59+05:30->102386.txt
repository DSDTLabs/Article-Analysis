LUCKNOW: The swearing-in of H D   at Kanteerava Stadium in Bengaluru may make history in Uttar Pradesh politics with the likely sharing of dais by SP national president   Yadav and BSP supremo  , signalling the cementing of a formidable coalition in the run-up to 2019 polls. This could be the first time the duo will share a public platform. 

 Karnataka's chief minister-elect Kumarswamy of Janata Dal (Secular) on Saturday night confirmed sending out invites to Mayawati and Akhilesh along with other regional party heads, including Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Telangana CM K Chandrashekara Rao and Andhra Pradesh CM  .
 
 Both camps are cheering the idea of podium unity, never mind if it's in Karnataka. Analysts feel the formal coming together of the two regional satraps, though historical, will be a formality, given recent statements by Mayawati in Karnataka where she admitted that a BSP-SP alliance will be announced once the seat-sharing formula is finalized for 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
 
 "We recently fought two bypolls in Gorakhpur and Phulpur parliamentary seats and the sharing of a public platform by our leaders, along with a host of others, will send a message that they stand united to counter the BJP in UP in the next general elections," said a senior SP leader, who confirmed that Akhilesh was likely to attend the swearing-in of Kumarswamy on Monday.
