ARA: The district unit of All India Students’ Association (AISA) took out a ‘pratiwad march’ here on Friday to   alleged assault on its members at Delhi University’s   on February 20.

 The march that started from the CPI (ML) office passed through the main thoroughfares of the town before culminating on the premises of Ara railway station, where it turned into a public meeting. The AISA members also burnt the effigy of Prime Minister   to protest “saffronisation of educational institutions” and frequent attack on students owing allegiance to left parties.
 
 Sabir, the district president of AISA, said it was nothing short of hooliganism on the part of ABVP members who created a rumpus to prevent JNU functionary Umar Khalid and former vice-president of JNU students’ association, Sahla Rashid, from addressing a seminar at Ramjas College on February 20. Sandeep, another AISA member, alleged some Delhi Police personnel also supported the ABVP activists. “The central government is trying to stifle the dissenting voices forcibly. It is dangerous for a healthy democracy,” he added.
 
 Other AISA members, such as Ranjan, Abhay, Abhishek, Sudhir and Dhirendra also addressed the protest programme.
