VADODARA: A two-year-old leopard   was rescued by the forest department near   village of   taluka in   on Sunday. 

 The cub was caught in a trap outside a cave in the mounds. Forest department officials said that villagers found the cub caught in the trap when they heard its roar. As the news spread, large crowd gathered. 
 
 “Some miscreant had made gallows with clutch cable of motorcycle and kept it outside the cave which the cub was probably going to enter,” said Vejalpur range forest officer Bhupendrasinh Matroja. He added that since it was a cub the gallows got stuck around its abdomen. “If it would have been an adult leopard, it could have been fatal,” he said.
 
 The cub did not have any injuries. When it was released, it went back inside the cave. Forest officials believe that it must have been staying inside the cave and would have come out to find food. 
 
 However, this is for first time that a trap was found in the mounds to catch the leopard.
