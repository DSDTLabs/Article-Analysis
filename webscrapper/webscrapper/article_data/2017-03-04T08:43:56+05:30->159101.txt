BENGALURU: When the Australian side landed in India last month, they were the underdogs. But in under three days in Pune they changed the perception and their fortunes. As they go into the second Test starting here on Saturday, the swagger of a dominant side is palpable as   believes his team is a 'couple of sessions away' from a series win.

 On match eve, the confident Australian skipper spoke on the playing XI and team spirit. 
 
 
 
 
 Based on how we performed last week, it was a good mix. We have good fast bowlers, allrounders who can bowl quick and two quality spinners as well. We feel that it is adequate to this wicket as well.
 
 
 It's just the mindset of playing for longer periods of time. The last wicket we played on we thought 250 was a good total. On this occasion we need to have a lot more than that in the first innings. Looking at the wicket, I think it is crucial to score big runs in the first innings and that's just about applying yourself and batting for long periods of time and building big partnerships.
 
 
 India are going to come back hard at us and there is no doubt about that. They have played very well at home. We are going to take a lot from the way we have played in the last game. They were some tough conditions but the way the boys adapted to them were spot-on. We have to start from ball one here. It looks like we will be playing on a different wicket. We know that we have to win one more game to win the   trophy and I think it can happen quickly here in India.
