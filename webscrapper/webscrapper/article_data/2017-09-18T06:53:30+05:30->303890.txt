NEW DELHI: In a move towards putting in place a bankruptcy regime for individuals, the government has set up an advisory panel under Justice B N Srikrishna to take the process forward. The 10-member panel will advise and “provide professional support“ to the Insolvency and  , the regulatory body headed by M S Sahoo, which is drafting the norms for filing bankruptcy by individuals and help them start afresh, a clause that is contained in the law but is yet to be operationalised.

 The law has set a threshold of over Rs 1,000 for which individuals can file for bankruptcy protection. This has to be filed with debt recovery tribunals and the process is seen to be inadequate. These tribunals are already over-worked and are seen to have been a failure in delivering results for banks, which had approached them for recovery of loans from companies and individuals. This is unlike companies, where a special legal platform in the form of the   has been set up.
 
 While an expert group is finalising the framework for bankruptcy code for individuals, the advisory committee will provide technical inputs to make the process a smooth affair. Apart from Justice Srikrishna, the other members include, former Sebi chairman C B Bhave, sociologist Dipankar Gupta, former chairperson of National Commission for Women Poornima Advani, former National Housing Bank chairman R V Verma, principal economic adviser Sanjeev Sanyal, lawyer and president of the Society of Insolvency Professionals Sumant Batra, CEO of the   Sunil Batra and Prithivi Haldea of Prime Database.
 
 The composition of the advisory committee shows that this is a sociological issue and not merely a subject involving default in payment. The issue has become even more challenging, following a spate of recent insolvency cases involving real estate companies.
