 “Arivazhagan Sir is a type of person, who always gives attention to details. He perfectly extracts what he wants from his technicians. I really feel proud to compose for his film. There are four songs in Kuttram 23 and among those,   song is really a special one for me, because it portrays the soft side of a cop. This song is built with common words related to cop such as jail, pistol, etc. But, instead of using usual Tamil words for these terms, lyricist Viveka has gone for traditional Tamil words. The response that we get from the audience for Kuttram 23 album has really put me at the peak of happiness, and I am pretty confident that the BGMs will make the audience to travel along with the script” says the composer.
