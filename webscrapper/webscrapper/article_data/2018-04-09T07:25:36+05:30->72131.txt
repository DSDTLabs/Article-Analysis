AHMEDABAD: A bridge as a metaphor connects two opposites - like   connecting the historic   to the developing and expanding Ahmedabad when it was constructed as the city’s first bridge on the   in 1870-71 and later in 1889. 

 The arched truss bridge - an icon of sorts for the city - today also connects places such as Manek Burj, considered to be the starting point of city’s boundary wall, on one hand, and Flower Park on the other. 
 
 Two student projects, part of CEPT University’s ‘Streets for People’ elective course in collaboration with   (CEE), tried to re-imagine the bridge and a flyover adjoining it with better utility and people connect. The ideas were presented to AMC officials in an event on Saturday.
 
 Madhavi  , programme director, CEE, said that Ellisbridge was an obvious choice with a lot of potential to bring it back to the focus of citizens. Another project tries to utilize the space below the flyover which is used for parking. Jigna Desai, assistant professor, CEPT, said that two teams of 12 students each worked for three months making on-the-ground observation and data collection.
