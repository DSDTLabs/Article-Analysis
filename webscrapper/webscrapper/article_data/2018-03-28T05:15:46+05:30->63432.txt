NAVI MUMBAI: Setting the stage for connecting Navi Mumbai and Mumbai by  ,   (NMMC) chief, N Ramaswamy and   (MMB) CEO, Vikram Kumar undertook a joint ride in a Coast Guard hovercraft on Tuesday morning. 

 If the project takes off, it will cut travel time between the central business district (CBD) of Belapur to South Mumbai by an hour. The joint operation being planned by the two bodies is a boat ride to Bhauccha Dhakka. 
 
 The two senior officers will hold a meeting next week to take it further. Both senior officers said they couldn’t “give a specific date”, but were seriously planning it. 
 
 “We can operate from the same jetty or develop another one next to it,’’ said Vikram Kumar. However, there could be an issue about developing another jetty close by if the Coast Guard raised objections due to security reasons.
