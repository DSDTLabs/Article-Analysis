VADODARA: Two companies from Gujarat will receive the Corporate Social Responsibility ( ) award for changing lives of the communities. 

 Ambuja Cements and   are the only two companies chosen for the award that will be given away by Gujarat governor, O P Kohli at Ahmedabad Management Association (AMA) in Ahmedabad on Thursday. The Gujarat CSR Authority has selected these firms after scrutinizing their CSR work.
 
 “Ambuja Cements brought a vast piece of land in   that faces salinity problem under irrigation. It helped the local farmers. Adani has been selected due to its efforts in   that helped in increasing the fishermen’s income by giving them work,” said A M  , CEO, Gujarat CSR Authority (GCSRA), Ahmedabad. 
 
 Tiwari said that GSCRA is changing the way the corporate sector in the state spends its funds on CSR activities. “Our idea was to have credible CSR awards and introduced a rigorous system to screen the companies. Apart from the automatic computer marking system, our team goes at the site and writes a report. Then videography is also done of the CSR work done by the companies.”
 
 An internal screening committee then shortlists the companies based on their presentations and final decision is taken by the jury. 
 
 “The companies are selected for awards based on impact of their CSR work on the community, whether their work can be replicated in other areas, project design and net outcome,” Tiwari, who is MD of Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd, told TOI. 
 
 A book on the CSR work done by the companies short-listed for this award too will be released on Thursday.
