KOLKATA: With over 700 scored each of the first two ODIs, India pacer   feels the par score in ODIs has just gone up. Talking to reporters on Saturday, the eve of the third ODI between India and England at the  , Bhuvi agreed that death-bowling is becoming more and more difficult these days.

 “Nowadays, 350 has become the par score in ODIs. That's how we plan our practice,” he stated. “Yes, it is difficult. Gone are the days when 250-300 used to be considered to be a par score, but now even 350 is not safe,” he said.
 
 “It's not easy for bowlers to bowl at the death as it's not easy to bowl yorkers with a wet ball because of the dew. We now practise bowling with a wet ball,” he added.
 
 Bhuvi, however, acknowledged that his experience of playing in IPL is coming in handy. “IPL has helped me to improve my bowling at the death. When the Sunrisers (Hyderabad) picked me, they were heavily dependent on me to bowl at the death,” said Bhuvneshwar, who returned to action in Cuttack after recovering from an injury sustained during the Kolkata Test against   last year.
 
 “It's tough when you're playing after a long time. There is nervousness but it's not because of lack of preparation. Preparation goes on even when you're out of the team as you can do it anywhere. I was practicing hard but was not playing matches,” he said about his comeback.
 
 “It's tough, but when you bowl the first two-three overs of the match, you get used to it and settle down after that,” he added.
