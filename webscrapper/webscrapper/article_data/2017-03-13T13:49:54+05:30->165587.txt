DJ-musician Martin Garrix says his song featuring singer   may never see the light day. 

 In a radio interview, the 20-year-old record producer says the tune 'Rewind Repeat It' could have been a major chartbuster but lots of technical issues have hampered the excitement of the release. 
 
  
  
 "It's all label issues and a lot of headaches. It was going to be an official track, so we postponed all my other singles, but the label delayed the track because they wanted to release other tracks from Ed first," says Garrix. 
 
 He adds, "At one point, it was two years ago, I didn't release a radio single for five, six months. So, then you get annoyed. So, I don't think we're ever going to release the track."
