Hyderabad: US-based machine-to-machine (M2M) and internet of things (IoT) solutions provider,   Inc, on Wednesday announced that it has consolidated its operations in the city and moved them to its first Centre of Excellence (CoE) in India at Gachibowli.

 In 2015, Orbcomm had acquired two companies with a presence in Hyderabad -- Insync and Wam Technologies. While the acquisition of InSync supported Orbcomm’s strategy to provide a complete set of applications and capabilities in the M2M industry, the acquisition of Wam strengthened its cold chain monitoring solutions, which include trailers, rail cars, gensets and sea containers. 
 
 “The company’s first CoE in India will be focused on software development and customer care for the IoT space. The Hyderabad office is the company’s largest software development site and houses web and mobile application developers and customer service representatives, who are part of the company’s global team of technical experts focused on the delivery of IoT products, services and solutions. We have 90 people at this centre and by the end of this year, we will be growing the number by another 30%,” Orbcomm executive vice-president (product development) Craig Malone told newspersons. The office will also support the company’s North America-based customer care team that offers customer service throughout the full solution delivery lifecycle for over 1.72 million end-user IoT devices on its global satellite and cellular networks. 
 
 Meanwhile, inaugurating the CoE, Telangana principal IT secretary Jayesh Ranjan also urged the company to consider manufacturing in the state “This will not only serve the domestic market but can also emerge as a manufacturing hub for the Asian market,” he said. The company has manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Germany.
