BHUBANESWAR: Tension ran high at Samjajpur on NH-316 near Puri on Wednesday following a clash between police and supporters of Lulu Sena, an outfit formed by the loyalists of late   leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra.   members were aggrieved over the death of a Congress supporter in a hospital here on Wednesday. 

 Keeping the body of the Congress supporter Sudarsan Swain in the middle of the road, Lulu Sena members blocked the road for nearly four hours from 1 pm, leaving hundreds of vehicles on the busy Bhubaneswar-Puri route stranded on both sides. Lulu Sena members alleged Swain died after being attacked by one Sanjay Swain, a known BJD supporter of Kotakana village at Chandanpur of Puri district on May 9. 
 
 "We demand immediate arrest of Sanjay and others, who attacked Sudarsan. Police purposely shielded the attackers, who are BJD supporters," alleged a Lulu Sena member. The road blockade was spearheaded by  's elder brother Lalitendu. The protesters allegedly hurled eggs and coconuts on police personnel when the latter tried to lift the road blockade. Puri Sadar sub-divisional police officer Alekh Pahi was hit by eggs. 
 
 "After the death of Sudarsan, we will treat it as a murder case. He was injured following a group clash at Kotakana village. Two cases were registered on the basis of complaints from warring sides," said ASP (Puri) Jagannath Pradhan.
