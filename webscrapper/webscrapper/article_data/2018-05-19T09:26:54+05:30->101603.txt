CHANDIGARH: The killing of gang member   is suspected to be a revenge attack for him giving information on gangster Rahul   that led to his death in an encounter nearly three years ago, said police sources.

 Khatta from Baghpatâ€™s Khatta Prahladpur village in Uttar Pradesh, who carried a reward of Rs 2.5 lakh, was gunned down in the encounter in Saharanpur on June 5, 2015. His accomplice, Vijay Valmiki, who carried a reward of Rs 50,000, was also killed. Two other men who were part of the group surrendered.
 
 Khatta was wanted by Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana and Delhi Police. He had 35 criminal cases registered against him in the four states and ran an extortion and kidnapping racket.
 
 Sources said to avenge the killing, gang members engaged gangster Monu Rana. Police said Vivek was known to Monu Rana and while on way to court, Monu Rana and others in a Toyota Fortuner intercepted the Alto car of Vivek. Vivek was later found murdered in Derabassi. Police were yet to ascertain the site where he was shot dead.
