MUMBAI:   on Friday directed the state government to produce   permission for the   of the proposed   it has built at Backbay Reclamation, Cuffe Parade. 

 "If there is no permission, we'll have to ask you to remove it," said a bench headed by the chief justice that heard a petition by Friends of Society. Representing the organization, senior advocate Mihir Desai and advocate Mrunalini Panchal argued that the land was used for years by 1,500 fishermen families for parking boats, maintaining nets etc. The petition challenged the change of reservation in 2000 from fishermen housing to government housing by MMRDA, the special planning authority for Backbay. 
 
 To the court's query, government advocate Hiten Venegavkar said construction was being carried out by the government. "To construct the statue, you require that much big office?" asked the bench. Venegavkar said they are "porta cabins". But Desai said construction does not seem temporary and no nod was taken from MCZMA.
