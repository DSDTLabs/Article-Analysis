 However, the movie that was released in August 2016 did not live up to the expectations of the audience and was met with criticism both from reviewers and audience. As the film took a first round exit even from the State Film Awards, audience engage in interesting discussions online about how Adoor, who has bagged awards galore in his career for his films, might have dealt with it. 
 
 While a few said that 'If the State Awards jury had given him the Best Film title being scared of his image, it would have been the most disrespectful thing to do to him,' a few others opined that 'It's time that the filmmaker tried to understand cinema and audience of modern times than stubbornly sticking to his old world views."
 
 The film, which was inspired by the famous Sukumara Kurup absconding case, has Dileep playing the role of Purushothaman Nair and Kavya as Devi.
