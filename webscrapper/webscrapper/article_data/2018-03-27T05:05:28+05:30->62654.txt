NEW DELHI: The SC-mandated   ( ) has found massive under-reporting of the number of trucks entering the city, leading to an annual shortfall of Rs 500-800 crore in the amount collected as   ( ) by the concessionaire but not deposited. 

 In a report submitted before the Supreme Court on Monday, EPCA said the calculation of the shortfall was based on two independent audits conducted to ascertain the number of trucks coming into Delhi, one of which was commissioned by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation that has been tasked with collecting the ECC.
 
 ECC was imposed by SC in 2015 to reduce air pollution by curbing the number of heavy vehicles entering Delhi. It had also directed that the ECC collected be used for pollution control.
 
 EPCA said, based on the SDMC-contracted audit, the weekly potential ECC collection should be Rs 15.8 crore at the minimum while only Rs 8.3 crore was being deposited. The second audit, conducted by Centre for Science and Environment estimated a much higher shortfall.
