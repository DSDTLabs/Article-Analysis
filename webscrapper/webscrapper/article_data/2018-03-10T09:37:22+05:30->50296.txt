CHANDIGARH: With the central government’s deadline for installing panic buttons in   set to expire on April 1, the   of Chandigarh administration has issued a reminder to all web taxis operating in the city to get the trigger. 

 To take stock of the situation and how to ensure the implementation of the order, the traqnsport department called a meeting with senior managers of all web-taxi operators next week. Since two web-taxi operators have registered with UT, they have deposited a licence fee of Rs 5 lakh each to the department and started their business in the city. As per records of the UT, the operators have around 3500 to 4,000 web taxis each operating in the city. “We have asked both of the taxi operators to install   in all taxis without any delay and link the same with the official app for public to use. Though this instruction is part of the order and notification besides other points, it has not been implemented on ground. Since they have deposited the licence fee to us and are operating a business, they will have to comply with the order without any further delay,” said a senior UT official.
 
 The Union ministry of transport, in the month of January, had written to all states and Union territories to comply with the order from 1st of April. “From April 1, 2018, passenger transport vehicles including taxis and buses are to be mandatorily equipped with GPS devices,” the ministry had said. A senior official of the central government, in a statement, had even said that there would be no extension in the deadline for rolling out these passenger-safety measures in public transport vehicles.
