NEW DELHI: One of the priorities of the re-aligned   in the state would also be to control the law and order as latest crime figures of   show a 20% increase in crimes in 2017 compared to the same period last year. An allegation of the BJP has been that jungle-raj was returning to Bihar under the erstwhile government due to the presence of Lalu Prasad’s RJD, its cadres and his interference in the working of the police.
 
  Over 90,000 crimes have been reported in Bihar this year till May, as per available crime figures. This year’s figure of 90,044 cognisable crimes, including nearly 1,100 murders and 3,700 cases of kidnappings, is a sharp spike from 76,082 cognisable crimes reported in first five months of 2016 when the same JDU-RJD government was in power. A total of 1.89 lakh cognisable crimes were reported in Bihar in entire 2016.
  
  A senior RJD functionary said this was lesser than 1.95 lakh crimes reported in 2015 when the RJD was not in power. “This shows that crimes in fact came down after RJD and JDU ran a government together in 2016. The Home portfolio – which controls police – has always been with the Chief Minister,” the senior RJD functionary said. Bihar BJP leaders however pointed to the sharp spike this year to stress that the “Lalu effect” was showing now on the law and order situation.
  
  
 A BJP functionary pointed out that crime figures of Bihar were much lower when BJP and JDU ran the Bihar government between 2006 to mid-2013. Against 1.89 lakh crimes reported in 2016, only 1.6 lakh crimes were reported in Bihar in 2012, 1.47 lakh in 2011 and 1.37 lakh in 2010.
  
  The major increase since has been under the head of ‘riots’, with the number rising steadily from 8809 in 2010 to 13566 in 2013 and 13311 in 2014. Among the major crimes reported till May this year also included 4717 incidents of riots, as per government figures. “The new government will focus on controlling law and order. Bihar is to be promoted as a safe and secure state for investment,” a senior BJP leader said.
