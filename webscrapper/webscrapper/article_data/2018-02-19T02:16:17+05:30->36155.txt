MUMBAI: A 33-year-old   resident,  , allegedly lost over Rs 1 lakh in 10 minutes after his debit card details were used to make ATM withdrawals in Delhi though the card was in his possession. What makes the case serious is that   had last used his debit card in a private bank to deposit money into his wife's newly opened account. In a complaint letter to Oshiwara police and BKC cyber police, he claimed that some bank staffers may have colluded with the accused to steal his money. 

 Khan has written to the bank seeking a refund as well as   footage of the Delhi ATM to identify the fraudster. The bank has asked him to wait for 90 days till they ascertain if the amount was fraudulently withdrawn. Police are yet to register an FIR; they have asked Khan to approach them only if the bank does not refund his money after 90 days.
 
  On February 3, Khan, who is employed as legal manager with a car manufacturing firm, visited the bank's   branch. "I had two accounts and wanted to shut one of them. I also wanted to open a fresh account for my wife. The staffers told me to deposit a minimum amount of Rs 10,000 into my wife's account as opening balance. As I had not carried my cheque book, I paid using my debit card," he said. 
 
 The next day, at 6.37pm, Khan got a text about a withdrawal of Rs 10,000 through an ATM at Delhi. "I immediately called up the bank's customer care, but the call didn't go through. By then, I started receiving a flurry of texts of more cash being withdrawn. By 6.47pm, 11 withdrawals of Rs 10,000 each had been made from my account. I finally got through to customer care and asked them to block my card and at 7.15pm, I got an email from the bank confirming it had been blocked."
