Television actor   aka 'Shaktimaan' was in Lucknow recently for a  . Giving his reasons for few films made for children in our country, Khanna, who's the chairman of Children's Film Society, India, said, "You have touched a raw nerve. Producers and directors are scared of investing their money in children's movies. But I keep on telling them ki bachhon ko pakdo, maa-baap free mein aate hain.   mein maine pakad kar dikhaya tha ki nahi?"

  Pointing out the content to which kids are exposed today, he says, "Kids these days are watching saas-bahu serials. Bacche   ke dialogue sunte hain ki itne chhed karunga, wagairah. That is why I have started a mission in my second year of chairmanship that movies being made for kids should be screened at theatres instead of being sent to festivals or schools because this is not the right way of showing films to kids."
 
  Khanna further adds, "They should buy tickets, go to the theatre where their parents and they can watch films together. Plus, I am selecting those films which have the potential to be released in a theatre. So it should not only have a message, but it should also be interesting. It is not enough to just make films for children, it's important to ensure that they are screened in theatres. I have commissioned eight such films and approved almost 30 others. This includes seven films which are based on different sports. Ek film chalegi toh filmon ki line lag jayegi."
