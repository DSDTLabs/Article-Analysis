INDORE: Every electoral voting machine ( ) in   scheduled in November will have global positioning system ( ) for location tracking.

 In a bid to ensure ‘clean’ elections, the authority has decided to equip the machine with GPS. The entire exercise is expected to reduce chances of error.
 
 3107 polling booths will be set up to conduct elections in nine constituencies of   district. For this, the administration has been provided around 4500 EVMs as in some booths, two EVMs need to be installed if number of candidates exceed 16.
 
 Every EVM has a bar code and using this, administration has started scanning the machine. The authority has also informed local representatives of all registered political parties about the process and invited them for inspection. After the five-day-long process, the machines will be sealed.
 
 The administration will bring another consignment of Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) in next couple of weeks and its demo will also be given to public.
 
 “We have started scanning EVMs and trial of GPS through mobile application. The political parties have been informed for their inspection during the five-day-long process,” assistant returning officer (ARO) Zamil Khan said.
