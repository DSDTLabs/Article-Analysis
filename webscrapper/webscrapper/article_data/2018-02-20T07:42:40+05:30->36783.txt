BENGALURU: The   has decided to replicate its successful Uttar Pradesh campaign model— Kamal Melas (lotus fairs) in Karnataka to reach out to the rural populace ahead of the 2018 elections. A series of village fairs, Kamala Jatres, will be held in the rural and backward areas of the state.

 While the attractions at the fairs are primarily for children with magic shows, giant wheels and merry-go-rounds, the BJP is using the community platform to woo the common man who may not attend conventional public rallies. The first such fair was held at Jewargi taluk of   from February 16 to 18, with a series of events, including a laser show highlighting Narendra Modi-government’s development schemes.
 
 Doddappa Gouda Patil, Kalaburagi BJP district president and a ticket aspirant from Jewargi constituency, said this will be replicated across the state. “The Jewargi experiment was quite successful, with a floating population of nearly 50,000 people attending the event. This appears to be an innovative model to propel the party’s image in rural parts by providing recreational activity for the entire family and also disseminate party information to the people,” said Patil.
 
 The entry and rides were free. “We charged a nominal fee of Rs 5 for bonda, bhajji etc,” said a BJP functionary. 
 
 Sources said the state unit is funding the jatres and is utilizing the services of the   (RSS) leaders. While BJP state leader Arvind Limbavali is being consulted for the campaign leadership, RSS strongmen B L Santosh and Arun Kumar are heading the organisational structure.
 
 Sources said fairs will be held in smaller towns and taluks across Mumbai-Karnataka, Hyderabad-Karnatak and Chamarajanagar, Kolar, Mysuru and Chikkaballapura in south Karnataka. It’s also platform for district leaders and ticket aspirants looking for building their image among the local population.
