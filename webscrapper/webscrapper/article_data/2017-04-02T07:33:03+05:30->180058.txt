BELAGAVI: The 68 villages of   taluk that were dependent on the   could soon be staring at a severe crisis. With the backwaters of the   drying up, people fear that the scheme could come to a halt within 10 days.

 Pump wells installed across the length of the backwaters of the  , built across the Malaprabha, are not receiving sufficient water, which can subsequently be pumped to the filtration plants. Water to the various villages in the taluk is distributed from these filtration plants. The scarcity of water is likely to affect 60,000 people living in the villages, besides the livestock.
 
 Katkol, Hulakund, Mudenur, M Kallapur and Salahalli are among the villages that will bear the brunt of the problem. Going by the availability of water, it’s expected that the department of rural water supply and sanitation will pump water into the wells for the next 10 days. Acute shortage of water in the months of April and May is an annual crisis for the people of Ramdurg taluk.
 
 Moreover, the groundwater in many of the villages is contaminated by fluoride and arsenic. The extent of chemical presence in groundwater saw the government come up with a plan to provide drinking water to these villages from the river.
 
 Taluk panchayat executive officer S K Patil said, “We’ll be able to cope with the water crisis. The zilla panchayat has made contingency plans to deal with the situation. The district administration too is providing water through tankers. The ZP has identified those villages that are likely to be affected most badly this summer, and arrangements are being made to supply water through private borewells.”
