AHMEDABAD: At least 15 students from Gujarat have made it to the top 200 in the JEE Main examination, whose result was announced on Monday by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

  Two students have made it to the top 50 in the country with Shreyansh Nagori, the state topper, bagging the 24th spot, and   bagging the 38th spot.
 
 Last year, Vedant Raval, a student of PBD High School, Maninagar was ranked fourth in the country and first in Gujarat in the all-India Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) Main. There were five students from Gujarat Board among the top 15.
 
  The JEE results, which were announced on Monday, revealed that the cut-off marks for eligibility to appear in JEE Advanced exam is at 74 marks — 15 marks lower than that in 2017 and nearly 26 marks lowers as compared to 2016. 
 
 Ironically, the state government has withdrawn from JEE stating that students affiliated with the   (GSHSEB) were not doing well in the JEE for engineering admissions
 
 The JEE Main exam was conducted on April 8 for students who preferred pen and paper, while online exams were conducted on April 15 and 16, 2018.
 
 Over 12,000 students from Gujarat had taken the exam held on April 8. JEE was earlier mandatory in Gujarat for admission to all engineering colleges. But in 2016, the state government re-introduced the Gujarat Common Entrance Test (GujCET) due to which fewer students are taking the JEE.
 
 Officials said that the merit rank of the students has gone down as compared to last year. Unlike 2017, when there were 7,000 students who had scored 225 or more, this year the number of such students was only 3,000.
 
 Officials said that according to an estimate, around 9,000 students are likely to qualify this year. However, this number was 11,500 in 2017. Officials said that despite the drop in the cut-off this year, fewer students have qualified.
 
 Khushi Kapadia, who scored 303 marks said that she had expected a higher rank. “Fewer girls are going in for IIT studies, but now more and more girls are cracking the examination. I found the paper tough. Chemistry was a tough section as one had to apply more logic for solving the questions,” she said.
