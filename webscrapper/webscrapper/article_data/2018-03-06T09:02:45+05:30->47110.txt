PANAJI: The directorate of vigilance has issued a circular to government employees warning them not to participate in agitations or campaigns which lead to the criticism of state government policies. Director of vigilance   has warned that such actions violate central civil service conduct rules and will invite disciplinary action.

 “It is noticed that government servants are getting involved in agitations or campaigns and signing petitions on issues which are against government policies,”   said in the circular.
 
 The circular has come under fire from the Goa Government Employees’ Association for creating confusion and fear among government employees since it warns that they could face action for criticizing the government.
 
 Goa Government Employees’ Association (GGEA) has demanded that the director of vigilance should amend or withdraw the circular within 15 days and simultaneously explain the reasons for issuing the circular.
 
 “It appears that you have issued the circular without assessing its implications. It creates an impression that the government is trying to suppress the rights and freedom of government servants and also threatening them of action on filing of any petition in the courts for seeking justice in conditions of service,” president, GGEA, John Nazareth said in a note.
 
 The circular says that “nothing contained in this clause shall apply to bonafide expression of views” by a government servant for the purpose of safeguarding the conditions of service or for securing a promotion, GGEA stated.
