The weather was bad at Delhi and flights were delaying. But, it was our coordinated efforts including airlines and airport authorities which prevented the flight get delayed. At around 10.10 am, the heart was taken from SMS Hospital and within one and a half hour it reached Delhi’s AIIMS,” said Dr  , nodal officer, Rajasthan Network for Organ Sharing (RNOS).
 
 SMS Hospital officials started retrieving the organs at around 5.30am. “Heart was flown to Delhi but liver and two kidneys were transplanted into patients at SMS Hospital,” said Dr DS Meena, superintendent, SMS Hospital.

 Heart has to be transplanted within four hours of harvesting. Timely transportation of heart is crucial for successful heart transplant.

SMS Hospital played key role in organ transplant as it conducted counselling of family of the donors to persuade them for giving consent for cadaver organ donation.
 
 The girl was admitted to the hospital on March 29. The doctors admitted her and provided her treatment. But, she did not regain consciousness. Hospital’s committee constituted for declaring brain dead examined her as per the laws and declared her brain dead two days ago.
