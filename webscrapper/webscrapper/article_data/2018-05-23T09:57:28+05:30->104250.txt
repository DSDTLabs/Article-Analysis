PATNA: Nationalist   ( ) general secretary   on Tuesday sought Centre’s immediate intervention in checking the unbridled rise in prices of petrol and diesel, saying it has hit the family budget of farmers and common people.

 
 “The Centre’s claim that petrol and diesel prices have been decontrolled and their domestic pricing is linked with international prices of crude oil does not carry much weight. The prices of petrol and diesel were kept checked till the Karnataka assembly elections were over. It means that the Centre exercises control over prices of petroleum products in the domestic market,” Tariq said.
 
 He added the Centre should provide some subsidy to petrol and diesel consumers as succour and also take concrete steps to bring petrol and diesel under Goods and Services Tax (GST) ambit.
 
 “When the crude oil prices were as high as $140 per barrel during UPA II government, the   netas used to blame the Centre for rise in prices of petroleum products in the domestic market. When the NDA government led by PM   came to power in 2014, the international prices of crude oil were as low as $40 per barrel, but its benefits have not passed on to the consumers,” Tariq added.
 
 On his party’s campaign for grant of special category status to the state, Tariq said he has written to 15 opposition leaders in the country to support the demand. “The NCP will hold a fortnight-long dharna at all the block headquarters in the state from May 28 to demand grant of special category status to the state,” Tariq said.
