VADODARA: Vadodara district collector P Bharathi on Wednesday directed the divisional controller of Vadodara division of the   (GSRTC) to submit a report regarding the traffic bottlenecks at   circle. 
 
 Following the death of 13-year-old school boy Het Chauhan, who was crushed under a GSRTC bus near Amitnagar circle on Sunday while he was on his way to   on his cycle, the cops have asked GSRTC to shift the bus stand near Amitnagar circle to some other place. 
  
 Although the GSRTC buses are being allowed to stop near the circle, the cops are presently manning the circle to ensure that they do not create traffic jams. While cops are maintaining that the bus stop needs to be shifted, GSRTC are arguing that they are facing problems regarding space. 
  
 “I have asked a report from the divisional controller of GSRTC regarding whatever bottlenecks they are facing so that we can find out a permanent solution,” Bharathi told TOI after the monthly co-ordination meeting with officials.

Later, cops who had reached the school intervened and five representatives from the parents were allowed to meet vice-principal of the school who took a written representation from the parents who were concerned about safety and security of their wards.
