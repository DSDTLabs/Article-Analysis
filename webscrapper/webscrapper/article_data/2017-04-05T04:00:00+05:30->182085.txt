Vadodara: Even as it has failed to maintain its position in the top 100 universities of the country, M S University is still in the dark about the score it has received in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) India Rankings 2017 survey released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development on Monday. 

 From 76th position which Gujarat’s only English medium university had earned last year when NIRF 2016 survey was held, the university’s ranking has slided further as the 2017 survey puts it in the rank band of 151 to 200 universities. On Tuesday, MSU officials made desperate attempts to know its exact score but it was told to wait for a week more. Interestingly, not ready to accept its complete failure, the university officials said they may even go for an appeal.
 
 “Since Monday evening, we are trying to know our exact score but the NIFR office whom we had contacted has informed us that we will be able to know the score only next week,” said MSU’s in-charge vice-chancellor professor Magan Parmar, adding that after thorough study and analysis, the university may also appeal to NIFR or the Knowledge Consortium of Gujarat to re-consider its ranking. 
 
 “We want to get clarity on which front we are lacking behind. Whether it is in terms of placements, inclusiveness, research or student-teacher ratio,” he said. 
 
 “Our concern is that last time when we were ranked at 76th position, we had scored 56 %. This time, the survey puts even those institutes who have scored 32 % in the top 100 list of universities. How can our score reduce so drastically within a year’s time,” he said. 
 
 Facing criticism from several quarters, the university officials argued that the survey judges all IITs, IIMs, central funded universities and institutes (with much lesser student strength) with the same yardstick. “Whereas our student strength is nearly 40,000. Also, being a state university, we have our own limitations,” he added.
