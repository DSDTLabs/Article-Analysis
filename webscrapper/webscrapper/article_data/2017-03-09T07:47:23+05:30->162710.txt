 Kiran, 26, a resident of Cubbonpet in central Bengaluru and a contract driver with the excise department, died at a private hospital on Tuesday. His mother Chandramma lodged a police complaint stating that the gym owner was responsible for her son's death. The gym is located in Kumaraswamy Layout.
 
 Police said initial investigations revealed that the instructor, who is missing, is himself not adequately trained. Cops are waiting for forensic test results before deciding on the next course of action. 
 
 Kiran had joined the gym in January and the instructor had promised the youth a six-pack in six months for a fee of Rs 25,000. According to Chandramma's complaint, Kiran was trained in various exercises in January. In February he was asked to take steroids and also given some powder to consume.
 
 The youth is said to have taken steroid injections and consumed the powder by mixing it with milk; he was allegedly asked to do so by the gym instructor. Kiran took ill in early March and was taken to a few doctors who declined to treat him. He was finally admitted to a private hospital, where doctors told Chandramma that steroids had complicated his condition. Kiran breathed his last on Tuesday.
 
 Acting on Chandramma's complaint, Ulsoorgate police sent Kiran's body to Victoria Hospital for postmortem
