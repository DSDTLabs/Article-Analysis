Chandigarh: Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar has urged the central government to give a new thought to its foreign policy in view of the escalating tensions, marked by an increasing number of deaths of Indian soldiers at the borders.

 Jakhar was talking to reporters here after attending the cremation of Sepoy Jaspreet Singh, martyred in Pakistani shelling on Tuesday in Naushera sector of Jammu & Kashmir, on behalf of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh.
 
 While the Congress was committed to standing by the Central government on foreign policy, it was also time for the Union government to change its policy in view of the ground realities, said Jakhar.
 
 “Rather than using the sacrifices of our soldiers as photo opportunities to showcase or making boastful claims, we should look closely at the ground realities and act according to the changing situation at the border,” he said.
 
 Responding to a question, Jakhar said he was not in a position to comment on whether India should launch another surgical strike, but he definitely felt that the current situation should be handled with more maturity instead of making hollow claims.
