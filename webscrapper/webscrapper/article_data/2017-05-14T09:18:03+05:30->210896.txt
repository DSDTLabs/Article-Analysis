VIJAYAWADA: Petrol bunks are going to be open on Sunday in Andhra Pradesh and the plan to opera te for only one shift in a day has also been postponed, sa id M Narayana Prasad, honorary general secretary of Consortium of Indian Petroleum Dealers.

 Earlier in the day , Andhra   (APFPT) announced that they would operate for only one shift a day from 9 am to 6 pm. The announcement was made in protest to the `low' margins they are receiving from the sale of oil. However, CIPD informed APFPT that Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) wanted to hold negotiations on May 17. Soon after APFPT shelved their plans.
 
  president   said the OMCs were reluctant to increase the dealers' margin even though a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two was signed based on the   committee report, where it was stated that there should be an increase in the dealers' commission on every litre of fuel sold.
 
 “We postponed the agitation temporarily with the request from civil supplies department and CIPD. If the meeting with OMC fails to meet our demands, we will observe oneshift operations and Sunday will be a holiday,“ said Krishna.It may be recalled that recently Prime Minister   had given a call to shut petrol bunks on Sundays as it would be an environmentally-friendly move at the same time it would boost the nation's foreign exchange reserves.
