  : A sessions court in Thoubal district on Thursday sentenced a former rural local body member to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment for raping a 20-year-old girl inside a restaurant in 2014. 

 The accused,   (34) - from Yairipok in Thoubal district - raped the girl on July 19, 2014 at a restaurant near the Thoubal district headquarters, case records state. A married man, Boby was a zila parishad member of the locality. He was arrested after the victim lodged a complaint, the records add. 
 
 The district and sessions court of Thoubal established that the charges against the convict go beyond reasonable doubt and convicted him under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. While announcing the prison term for Boby, the court also slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on him. During trial, 12 prosecution witnesses and 10 documents related to the case were examined by the court. No defence witnesses appeared in court. This came a couple of days after a boarding owner was sentenced to 15 years' jail term by an Imphal court for raping a minor.
