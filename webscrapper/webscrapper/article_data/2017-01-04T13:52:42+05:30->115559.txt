MUNGER
  The court of additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) Phool Chandra Choudhry on Tuesday awarded life imprisonment to two-time former RJD MLA   (55) in a 1988 murder case. Ranvir is the husband of sitting JD(U) MLA Poonam Devi. The court also slapped Rs50,000 fine on him.
 
  Soon after the verdict, Ranvir complained of chest pain and he was taken to Munger sadar hospital.
  
  Additional public prosecutor Preetam Kumar Vaishya said Ranvir was found guilty of killing his cousin Sunil Yadav, son of Madan Yadav of village Chukti under Khagaria police station on December 6, 1988 over a trivial issue. Sunil, soon after receiving a gunshot injury, was rushed to the sadar hospital, Khagaria, where he named Ranvir. Later, he was shifted to Nazareth hospital, Mokama, where he died while undergoing treatment. Sunil’s statement to the police was considered his dying declaration.
  
  “Ranvir’s brother Kailu Yadav was also made a non-FIR accused in this case, but he died later. The trial started in Munger court as there was no judges court in Khagaria at that time. When the one started functioning there, the case was transferred to Khagaria sessions court. But, on a petition that the trial might be influenced, the case was again transferred to Munger by the Patna high court order,” said Vaishya.
  
  Ranvir was also an accused in the infamous Taufir diara massacre on November 11,1985. Five persons were killed and 300 houses were burned. Speedy trial was conducted in the court of ADJ-VI AP Srivastava, who had awarded death sentence to five and life term to 55, including Ranvir. Later, the state government filed a petition in the court and Ranvir’s life term was commuted.
  
  Ranvir, after the judgement, said he would appeal against the order in the Patna high court.
