THRISSUR: It was the circulars issued by the central explosive department that had created the hurdles in the smooth conduct of fireworks as part of festivals in the state, said minister for agriculture and Thrissur MLA V S   here on Friday.

 Addressing a press conference here the minister said these circulars were based on the policies of the central government, and the   leaders should answer the questions on these policies.
 
 There was no point in blaming the state government for the present crisis, the minister argued. The state government had an open mind in the conduct of the festivals in the traditional manner he said and added that none of the circulars issued by the state government sought to block any of the rituals associated with the festivals.
 
 “We are ready to explore the legal options to resolve the present crisis. The state government has submitted a report to the Centre on the conduct of the pooram festivals. We are awaiting the response of the Centre on the report for proceeding with further actions,” Sunilkumar clarified.
 
 He said there would not be any hitches in the conduct of fireworks during Thrissur Pooram as both the Thiruvambady and   possess magazines to stock 2,000 kg of fireworks each.
 
 The minister alleged that deliberate efforts were being made to politicize the present crisis.
 
 The central explosive department officials who had visited the state to study the demands of the festival committees in January had said they would submit their report in ten days. “Who is responsible for the delays in the decision on those reports,” Sunilkumar asked.
 
 On the proposed agitation plans of the festival committees in front of the residences of ministers from the district, Sunilkumar said the state government was not for a confrontation with the festival committees.
