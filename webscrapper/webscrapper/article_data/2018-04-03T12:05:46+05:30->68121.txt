LUDHIANA : The family of  , a native of   village, kept requesting officials on Monday evening to let them open his coffin, so that they could see his remains one last time.

 But, they were not allowed to open it and the remains were cremated in the presence of sub-divisional magistrate (east)   at night. The cremation was performed using the headlights of tractors, after a power cut in the area.
 
 Earlier, his family was escorted to Amritsar by a representative of the administration in an ambulance, which then carried Balbir’s coffin home. Just before his abduction in June 2014,   had called up his family and said that he had saved money and would return home soon. However, the man who had left the country to earn money for his four children returned home dead.
 
 As soon as the coffin reached his home, Balbir’s inconsolable wife Babli said, “He had gone there to earn money for our better future and the marriage of our daughter. However, he has returned dead. I wish we had never allowed him to go to Iraq.” “I have waited for so long to see him and now administration is not allowing us to see him for the last time,” she wailed.
 
 Deputy commissioner   said, “They might get disturbed to see the mortal remains — that is why the administration is avoiding to open the coffin.”
 
 “Even after the central government announced his name in the list of victims 13 days ago, none was ready to accept the news till the mortal remains came home. The government has taken a real long time to announce the death,” Balbir’s brother   said. Balbir went to Iraq in 2010 to earn money. Prior to that, he had worked as a contractual labourer at the divisional forest department. Balbir took a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh at 5% interest for going to the strifetorn country.
