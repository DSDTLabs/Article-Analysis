NAGPUR: The   has threatened a mass bunk from 8am March 17 to 8am March 18 across the state. 

 The association is protesting the government’s inability to protect resident doctors from assaults by patients’ relatives. They particularly cited the Dhule assault on a resident.
 
 Central   president from Mumbai Dr Parag Narkhede told TOI that it was shocking that despite the medical education minister accepting all the MARD demands during a recent meeting the government has not kept its word. 
 
 “The assurances are apparently meant to be on paper. Nothing changes on the ground. How long can we pull on such false promises,” he said.
 
 Dr Dinesh Sharma, the MARD president at the   (GMCH) said that the association handed over a mass bunk notice to the college dean Dr A Niswade on Wednesday. 
 
 He said the resident doctors took out a candle march as a mark of protest on Wednesday and used black badges.
 
 The central MARD is calling the mass bunk to revise their demands to the medical education minister Girish Mahajan. These include proper security measures, implementation of pass system strictly for relatives and visitors, improvement in hostel conditions, freeship issue, TB and maternity leave, grievance redressal cell, PG bond issue, insurance for doctors.
