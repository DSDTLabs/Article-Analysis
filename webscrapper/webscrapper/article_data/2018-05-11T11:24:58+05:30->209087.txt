International singing sensation,  , who performed in   at the  , was welcomed by close to 45,000 fans on Wednesday evening. Among the attendees was Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar’s 17-year-old son, Arjun, who was seen along with his group of friends having a good time and grooving to the tunes while simultaneously trying to keep a low profile. He walked in with crutches as he had injured his left ankle while playing cricket. The teenager, who has often been called a Justin lookalike, refused to acknowledge his iconic last name. “I’m Arjun Sanghai,” he told us. Referring to his height, he added, “Sachin’s son is not so tall”. However, he gave in after we refused to budge. When we asked him if he was a Belieber, he said, “Not particularly. But I do get that (comparison with Justin) a lot.” We must say, Tendulkar Jr’s naiveté was quite amusing and adorable at the same time. He definitely seems to have taken after his famous father as far as dodging attention is concerned.
