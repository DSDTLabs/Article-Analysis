LUDHIANA: A government schoolteacher has accused two teachers of another government senior secondary school of allegedly raping a schoolgirl and conspiring to abort her foetus when she got pregnant. The whistleblower teacher has sent a complaint to director general of police (DGP)  , education secretary  , DPI (secondary) Paramjit Singh, SDM Kanu Thing and DEO (secondary) Swaranjit Kaur.

 Besides the complaint, the teacher has forwarded an audio clip of three minutes and 50 seconds in which the two schoolteachers are discussing ways of getting the student’s abortion done. They allegedly say they would make her fall down and then rush her to a hospital. They also plan how they would avoid taking along a woman teacher (The Times of India has a copy of the complaint and the audio clip).
 
 The complainant told the TOI, “I was posted at that school and got transferred about eight months ago. A few days ago, I received the audio clip in which I recognized the in-charge principal of the school talking to another teacher about the case. I was shocked.”
 
 He added, “I am not sure if they have gone ahead with the abortion. As soon as I got to know about it, I raised the issue with the authorities concerned. If these teachers are not punished, they can target another girl too.”
 
 The complaint stated, “The conversation of the in-charge principal has gone viral. It is clear from the conversation that the teachers have raped the schoolgirl and were conspiring to get her foetus aborted. It is a serious matter that warrants a high-level inquiry and quick action.”
 
 DEO (secondary)   said, “We have received the complaint with an audio clip. An inquiry has been marked.”
 
 Deputy DEO (secondary)  , who will be inquiring the matter, said, “I will visit the school on Wednesday and the voices recorded in the audio will be matched.”
