BENGALURU: A day after a city hospital filed a complaint against senior Congress leader CM Ibrahim’s son-in-law, alleging vandalism, TOI found the latter on the premises of the medical institution, by his wife’s side.

 Ibrahim’s daughter, Ifa, 20, was admitted to   in Vasanthnagar in a critical condition on Monday night. To save Ifa, who was 15 weeks pregnant, the doctors on Tuesday performed an abortion. When he learnt that his wife had undergone an abortion, Faisal, who is also Ibrahim’s nephew, ransacked the hospital, alleging that the doctors had not sought his permission before performing the procedure.
 
 Hospital authorities subsequently filed a complaint against Faisal at the Cubbon Park police station on Tuesday night. However, on Wednesday, Faisal and his father Khader were seen at the hospital.
 
 Ifa’s condition was stable on Wednesday, and she was shifted from the Intensive Care Unit to a ward. “Her condition has improved, and she is likely to be discharged on Thursday,” a source in the hospital said.
 
 However, Vikram Hospital has not withdrawn the FIR against Faisal.
 
 Nagalaxmi Bai, chairperson of the Karnataka Women’s Commission, had an hour-long discussion with Ifa on Wednesday at the hospital. “Her condition was such that she couldn’t speak to me today. But I spoke to the doctors, who informed me that her condition was critical when she was admitted, and she was bleeding severely. Sub-inspector Anjumala Naik visited Ifa, but the latter said she was not ready to make any statements to the cops. Ifa said she would give a written statement on Thursday. We have to wait for her statement, before taking any action,” said Bai.
 
 The hospital barred entry to the media on Wednesday.
