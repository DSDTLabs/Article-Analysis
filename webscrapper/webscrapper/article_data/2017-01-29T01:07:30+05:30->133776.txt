NAVI MUMBAI: Civic chief   has termed   atop housing societies’ terraces as   and directed the encroachment department to remove them immediately. Societies having such weather sheds should be prepared to receive notices from  , ordering their removal.

 The move comes after complaints by citizens about flat owners covering terrace areas drew Mundhe's attention to these weather sheds.
 
 “NMMC has not given any permission to societies for installing such sheds. All such construction amounts to encroachment. It will be removed voluntarily or demolished,” said Mundhe.
 
 Weather sheds are put up by numerous residential societies to prevent water seepage during monsoon. Officials from encroachment department said that they have issued orders to ward offices to survey societies having such sheds. “There are 6,500-odd residential societies in the city. Ward offices will have to identify which societies have such constructions. A comprehensive report will be filed with the   and then notices will be issued to remove these structures,” said an official from the encroachment department.
 
 One of the reasons NMMC does not give permits for such structures is for the building’s stability. "Even the load-bearing capacity of the building gets compromised. Therefore no such permission is given,” said the official.
 
 Residents are not sure about the success of this move, considering NMMC still finds it hard to free public space. “It would be interesting to see how this will work, considering public space still remains encroached,” said Nerul resident Anarjit Chauhan.
 
 He added that even though the drive to remove encroachment from marginal spaces is on, vendors continue to occupy footpaths. “There are a couple of NMMC toilets, where such weather sheds have been put up. Will NMMC initiate same action on their own properties,” he asked. —Sameera Kapoor Munshi
