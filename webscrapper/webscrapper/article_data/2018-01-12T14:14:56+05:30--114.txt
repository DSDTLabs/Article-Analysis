Trichy: With uncertainty prevailing over the stir being observed by   (TNSTC) employees, the transport corporation has planned to operate 200 special bus services from   to Chennai. Three temporary bus shelters have also been established in the city to cater the extra rush during Pongal festival as TNSTC claim that 90% of the mofussil fleets are back on roads.

 Weighing on the expected return of TNSTC employees on Friday, the transport corporation has planned to operate 350 special bus services including 200 services for Chennai and few others for Coimbatore and Madurai. As on Thursday, about 450 part-time drivers and part-time conductors have helped the transport corporation to operate the grounded fleets, the official sources added. Three temporary bus shelters at Williams Road for buses heading to Thanjavur, Iluppur road and Mannarpuram roundabout respectively for Pudukkottai and Madurai destinations were established on Thursday and the facility will be thrown open for public from Friday.
 
 Even as the TNSTC employees continued their strike seeking wage revision for the eighth consecutive day, operation of TNSTC fleets returned to almost normal on Thursday. “Around 90% of the fleets in Trichy depots are on roads with the help of part-time drivers and conductors. On Thursday, 5-10% of protesting employees were back for duty and we expect more in numbers to turn up for work by Friday,” a senior TNSTC official said.
 
 “We are still awaiting the final decision from our trade union representatives in Chennai. To ensure that public is not affected due to absence of bus service during Pongal festival, we may return back to duty on Friday,”  , protesting TNSTC employee said.
