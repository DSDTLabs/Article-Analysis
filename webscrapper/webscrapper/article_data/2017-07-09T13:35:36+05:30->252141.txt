VASCO: Girish Pille was elected unopposed as sarpanch of the Sancoale panchayat on Saturday afternoon. Pille belongs to the Cortalim MLA Alina Saldanha’s panel. Meanwhile, Nandini Desai was elected unopposed as the deputy sarpanch.

 Speaking to reporters, Pille said that keeping in mind the increasing crime rate in Zuainagar and considering that the area houses one of Goa’s biggest slum, a full-fledged police station is the need of the hour. “At present we only have an outpost of the Verna police station. I will work on all the possibilities of getting a full-fledged police station,” Pille said.
 
 Hinting at the corruption by the former panchayat body, Pille said, “I will work for a corruption-free panchayat, one that will work for the welfare of the village. Under Saldanha’s guidance we will reach everybody.”
 
 Saldanha’s panel had won seven out of 11 seats in the Sancoale panchayat election. The other panel, that of former sarpanch  , failed to obtain a majority.
