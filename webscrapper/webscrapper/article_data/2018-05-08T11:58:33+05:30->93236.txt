JAIPUR: The principal bench of the National Green Tribunal at New Delhi has sought an inspection to ensure that water from the effluent treatment plants on its banks is not flowing into River Luni. The inspection will be conducted by Dr  , former expert member of NGT. The tribunal has sought a report by May 30.

 In earlier orders, the tribunal has barred even the release of treated water from these plants into the river. Petitioner Digvijay Singh Jasol asserted that even after treatment, water is not of such quality that it will not pollute the river. 
 
 There are over 800 textile units on the banks of the river at Jasol, Bithuja and   in   district. The River Luni is a seasonal river that runs dry through a vast stretch in the summer, but flows after the monsoon, traversing over 500 km through   before disappearing in the sands in the   of Kutch. The effluents produced by textile units, the petitioner has held, is far in excess of the capacity of the four Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETPs) in the area. In 2012, the petitioner had argued that over 80 million litres per day (MLD) is produced by the textile units, while the common treatment plants together had a capacity of only about 50 MLD.
