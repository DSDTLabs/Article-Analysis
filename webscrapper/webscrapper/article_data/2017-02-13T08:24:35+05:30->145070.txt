MUMBAI: Gangster Arun Gawli’s daughter and Akhil Bharatiya Sena (ABS) candidate   faces a tough fight in ward 212 (Dagdi Chawl). 

 The biggest threat to Geeta, a two-term corporator, is from MIM’s Noor Saba Yusuf Chaudhry, a homemaker. Retaining ABS’s two seats—the other is held by Geeta’s aunt, Vandana Gawli (ward 207)—is the party’s main focus though ABS has fielded 30 candidates. 
 
 In 2012, BMC elections Shiv Sena-BJP alliance didn’t put up a candidate and Geeta won easily. But this time both   and Sena are fighting separately and have also put up their candidates—Mandakini Khamkar (BJP) and Sonal Saigaonkar ( ). Though there are two more Muslim candidates Nazia Ashfaque Siddiqui ( ) and Rukhsana Saeed Moosa (SP), MIM wants to repeat the story of the 2014 Assembly polls here when the party’s candidate Waris Pathan trumped other candidates, including Geeta, in Byculla. 
 
 Geeta who, in absence of her father (Gawli is serving a life term for a 2008 murder), is desperately trying to retain the seat. “I am fighting for development. People, including Muslim voters, know my work and will back me again,” said Geeta. After the delimitation, Muslim pockets like Transit Camp and Lambi Cement Chawl got added to the ward, swelling the Muslim votes here. Out of the population of nearly 61,000, around 65% voters are Muslims whom the MIM is wooing aggressively. 
 
 “Geeta is facing anti-incumbency factor. Muslim youngsters want a change,” said MIM’s supporter Sohail Ahmed. Drawing comparisons between Geeta and MIM’s candidate Noor Chaudhary, MIM MLA Waris Pathan said, “Geeta has not been to college while our candidate is a graduate, who is a good orator.”
