THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The alleged lackadaisical attitude prevailing in state universities in recognising courses of institutions, including that of premier ones like  ,   and  , has prompted the state higher education council to ask varsity vice-chancellors to exercise their special powers to deal with such retrograde practices. 

 There are widespread complaints that graduates from premier institutions and other UGC-recognised varsities are being denied job and research opportunities in the state. Though state universities are supposed to recognise courses of UGC-recognised institutions, they seldom follow it, it is alleged.
 
 "Several bright candidates are frustrated due to our universities' absurd procedures with regard to recognition of courses that takes one to two years," pointed out higher education council vice-chairman Rajan Gurukkal.
 
 "This is a stupid charge that only bodies under the control of conventionally-trained teaching faculty with disciplinary narrowness, cross-disciplinary illiteracy and academic obsolescence dare to put up. Many of the candidates have high scores in   or   fellowship tests. Domestic constraints retain them (candidates) here or otherwise they would have also fallen prey to brain drain," Gurukkal said in a communication sent to vice-chancellors.
 
 He observed that the state universities not only refuse to admit these talented youngsters but also disapprove their entry to other research institutions in the state. "  is equally at fault by excluding them for differences in the nomenclature of their knowledge fields or degrees. Even after getting high ranks in tests, the incumbents are forced to move courts," he noted.
 
 The higher education council will draft a comprehensive manual of various academic programmes, fields, degrees, their different nomenclature offered at various institutions for employers to understand. "Until the manual is ready, vice-chancellors should exercise their special powers," he said.
