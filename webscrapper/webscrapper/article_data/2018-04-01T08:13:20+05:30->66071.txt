MYSURU: Chief minister   on Saturday said voters in Varuna constituency want him to contest from there, but he has made up his mind to shift to   as this will be his last election.

 “I’ve decided to fight my last election from Chamundeshwari as I’ve derived my political strength from this segment,” he told villagers at Anandur in   taluk. 
 
 After a day’s rest at a private resort in Bandipur Tiger Reserve in Chamarajanagar, he campaigned in Megalapura, Mallegowdana Koppal, Undawadi, Chikkanahalli, Kallur Naganahalli, Sagarkatte and Gungarchatra villages. His son Yathindra was also present. 
 
 Post delimitation, Siddaramaiah had opted to contest from Varuna in 2008 and in 2013. He has represented Chamundeshwari five times. 
 
 When asked about the BJP’s plan to field B Y Vijayendra, son of former CM B S Yeddyurappa, from Varuna, he said anybody can contest the polls and it’s for the people to choose their representative.
