LUCKNOW: Eight-year-old   said it loud: “Yeh desh mera hai, mujhe bahar nikalne se koi nahi rokh sakta. Yeh mera haq hai (This is my country, no one can stop me from going out. This is my right).” 

  That’s the message citizens sent out when they came together at 1090 crossing in   on Saturday evening for #IWillGoOut campaign to reclaim safe public spaces for women. The campaign that started on social media turned into a national movement after many incidents of molestation reported across the country during New Year’s Eve.
 
 “Discrimination itself is a form of violence. In our society girls grow up with dolls while boys play with guns. The change has to start from our own homes,” said activist and programme’s co-organiser  .
 
 The campaign was carried out across 30 cities and the Lucknow chapter was led by social activist Alisha Asif who said it’s a woman right to have safe spaces and a violence free world, both in and outside their homes. The crowd chanted “Main bhi bahar jaungi, pinjre main na reh paungi,” a poem written by activist   for the occasion.
 
 More than 300 people will sign the petition from each city which will then be sent to the President of India and the Union government.
