The crew of the recent   starrer   walked in together into a prominent movie hall in Kochi to attend a screening. 

 Not only did they catch the film, the team also shook a leg with the dancers of a flash mob at the venue. Though the lead actor wasn’t present, someone in the crew made up by putting on a mask of the actor’s face. And not just any mask — a jovial, Santa-capped one! 
 
 Dressed in their chic best, the actors as well as the crew spent time at the venue even after the show. A cake was also cut, making the occasion sweeter.  ,  , Nandan Unni,  , Badhusha and filmmaker Kannan Thamarakkulam were among those present.
