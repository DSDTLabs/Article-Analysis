KOLKATA: The roof of a room of an old mansion on   collapsed on Saturday night, but no one was thankfully injured. The incident -the fourth such in the last three months - comes less than 24 hours after a teenaged girl was killed in   after the roof of her house fell on her as she was sleeping.

 The building was constructed by the De family, who worked for the  , during the days of the Raj, around 250 years ago.
 
 Immediately after the collapse, KMC's buildings department officials, the MMiC and local councillor Taraknath Chatterjee visited the spot, accompanied by police. They conducted a survey to gauge whether any other portion was in danger of crumbling.
 
 The collapse has shaken the owner, Mohan Lal De, who refused to speak to the press. But he confirmed that the roof had collapsed around 11pm on Saturday. Naba Kumar Ghosh, owner of Sriram Sweets on the ground-floor plot just beside the collapsed portion, said: â€œThe family did not carry out any repairs. I am very afraid. I hope the roof doesn't collapse on my head."
 
 The De family used to work with the British East India Company, and had built the house 250 years ago. The building bears signs of old grandeur: stained-glass windows, a wooden staircase, an enormous pillared thakurdalan, big wooden doors. And, in spite of Ghosh's allegation, there are signs that the owner had carried out some repairs. The thakurdalan, for instance, has been restored.
