DEHRADUN: One of  's oldest   -   - has been wearing a deserted look. This is because the   outlets near highways has forced the iconic club to close its popular bar. The club, regarded as the preferred watering hole of the city's elite, is located opposite Parade Ground near Rajpur Road (designated as part of the  ) and comes within the ambit of the 500-metre rule laid down by the SC. 

  The club's president Rohit Jain said that average daily sales from the bar were between Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000 which contributed towards a big chunk of the institution's earnings. "I do not know how the financial gap will be filled this month because there is little hope of getting the bar open. If this continues for a long time, it will be difficult for us to manage expenses and pay salaries," said Jain. 
 
 The club was founded in 1878 and moved to its current location in 1901. According to Jain, the club's entry gate was close to Rajpur Road, as a result of which its bar came under the ambit of the SC order. "In accordance with the Supreme Court's directions, we had to close liquor sales in the bar and have been selling only juices and soft drinks," he said.
 
 Many old-timers of the club said that the closure of the bar was "a big put-off." "The Dehradun Club has been a preferred place for us to entertain guests as well as catch up with friends over a few drinks. So, the bar's closure has come as a disappointment," said Kanti Kumar, a member. Meanwhile, an official of the club said that deliberations were going on regarding interpretation of the SC order. "We are trying to seek some clarity on the order. The club is spread over a wide area but its present entry gates are falling within the 500 meter radius. We are trying to see if we can have a new entry gate from Donga House side and if this can resolve the issue."
