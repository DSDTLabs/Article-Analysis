CHENNAI: The patrons of a roadside temple in the   locality of Choolaimedu were allowed to construct a ‘yaaga kundam’ (pyre pit) on a public road, without inviting action from the   for 15 days.

 The violation happened on the Minor Trustpuram Main Road in ward 112 of Teynampet (Zone 9). Though it was a one day function, the temple’s promoters built a permanent concrete structure, blocking more than half of the road’s carriageway.
 
 According to a Facebook post by a local resident, Pradeep Kumar Manokar, the temple’s promoters had conducted a consecration ceremony on February 26. “...organisers (of the ceremony) blocked one side of the road and constructed agni kundams in the middle of the road. Who are the authorities who let it happen?” he asked.
 
 A longtime resident of the road, Mrs Reego, told TOI that the construction began a week prior to the date of ceremony. “Entrance to our homes were blocked. Loud speakers would blare music as early as 4am. Nobody from city corporation or the police took action,” she said. On Monday afternoon, after a TOI team visited the spot, Greater Chennai Corporation officials destroyed the structure. A street vendor on the road told TOI that two lorries removed the rubble. “There is still one load of debris left to be cleared,” he said, requesting anonymity.
