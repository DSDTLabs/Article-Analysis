PANAJI: Villagers and activists from Chimbel, Curca-Bambolim-Talaulim and Azossim-Mandur are coordinating a move to forge a united front to oppose inclusion of their areas under Greater   Planning and Development Authority (GPDDA). 

 The opposition to the formation of Bambolim planning area comprising areas of St Cruz, Chimbel, Curca-Bambolim-Telaulim and Kadamba planning area comprising Gancim, Azossim-Mandur, Ella and   was spearheaded by villagers of St Cruz.
 
 A human chain along national highway 17 and a rally and public meeting near St Cruz church culminated in the resignation of local MLA  . The protest was supported by villagers of other areas proposed to be included in the two planning areas.
 
 "Holding of corner meetings is in progress in the PDA-affected areas. Now, villagers have begun to understand the ill effect of the proposed inclusion in GPPDFA," Arturo D'Souza, an activist from St Cruz said.
 
 Both planning areas are proposed to be brought under the jurisdiction of the GPPDA.
 
  In gram sabhas held on February 25, members of Chimbel, Curca-Bambolim-Talaulim, Siridao and other panchayats opposed the PDA proposal, citing adverse impact on environment, social and health problems due to PDA-oriented vertical development. "A series of meetings in wards of Curca panchayat have been planned and some are being already held to carry on the protests against the PDA," a local from Curca said. 
 
  Gram sabhas in Old Goa and Carambolim discussed the issue but the panchayats did not show interest in continuing the discussion, stating that the proposal was ambiguous and clarifications had been sought from authorities.
