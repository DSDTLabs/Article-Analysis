KOPPAL/NEW DELHI: An alert person taking an early morning stroll saved the day for people travelling in a private bus that was up in flames minutes after they alighted.

 A bus carrying 22 passengers was enroute Gadag from Bengaluru when it caught fire. The fire ignited in the left indicator of the bus and slowly heavy smoke could be seen coming out of it. 
 
 A man called Veerabhadrappa Shyambavar was talking his routine morning walk on the road when he noticed the smoke coming out of the bus crossing him by. Without wasting another moment, he shouted as loud as he could, signalling the driver to stop the bus. Hearing his may day call, others around him gathered together and called out to the driver of the bus as loudly as they could.
 
 Of the 22 passengers, only eight were in the bus while the rest had alighted on the way. The driver heard their call, immediately stopped the bus and woke up all the passengers, asking them to alight as quickly as possible. 
 
 Meanwhile, the fire spread to the entire floor of the bus and the driver and the staff doused the flames. The bus was completely gutted in the fire but no life was lost, thanks to the alertness and quick response of Veerabhadrappa.
 
 A   is believed to be the cause of the fire.
