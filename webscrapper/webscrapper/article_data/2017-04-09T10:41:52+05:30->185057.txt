PANAJI: Goa is in the process of carrying out individual profiling of students with special needs enrolled in special schools across the state, sources said. The profiling is expected to help identify the relevant vocational training that can be provided to each of the children to enable them to be self-employed in the future.

 “To begin with, special educators of the schools will be asked to furnish detailed profile of the child in a given format suggesting four potential areas of vocational training/employment for each child,” a state official said.
 
 In 2015-16, 4,796 children with special needs (CWSN) were enrolled in Goa’s schools from Classes I to XII, according to   (DISE) data of the Union human resource development ministry. Few of these children are not able to pursue education beyond high school due to various difficulties. And Goa has few vocational training or residential facilities for those with special needs, leaving most of them dependent on their families. While 88% of the total CWSN population in Goa were enrolled in schools at the primary school level, at the secondary school level, this percentage came down to 10% and dropped further to just 2% at the higher secondary school level, as per  .
 
 In this year’s budget, to better understand the problems of persons with disabilities, the chief minister had said that the government would undertake a comprehensive research study of socio-economic conditions, educational and employment status to find out various problems faced by this community. Based on that, government will implement future schemes and projects for their overall development, as per their specific requirements, he had said.
