COIMBATORE: A day after news reports brought to light the plight of  , who had been dedicatedly working to curb man-animal conflict despite being not paid for the past two months, the state forest department on Wednesday passed orders to disburse their   at the earliest.

 “The chief conservator of forests has issued orders to disburse their salary and also directed the district forest officer to make the payments immediately,’’ said a forest officer.
 
 The salary, however, would be delayed by two more days due to the ongoing strike by the bank employees. The salary would be credited to their bank accounts once the strike ends. “The anti-poaching watchers will get their two months pending salary,’’ the officer said.
 
 There are a total of 136 anti-poaching watchers in the district. They were recruited 10 years ago on a temporary basis. Though anti-poaching watchers play a crucial role in preventing poaching as well as smuggling of forest wealth, they were initially paid a meagre monthly salary of Rs 2,314. Gradually their salary was increased, and it was fixed at Rs 10,000, last year.
 
 Forest officials said the anti-poaching watchers were not paid for the past two months due to the administrative delay in allocation of funds that takes place at the end of the financial year.
 
 While thanking forest officials for clearing their salary dues, anti-poaching watchers, however, said their grievances do not end with the payment of salary. 
 
 An anti-poaching watcher said they were not paid festival bonus. Besides, they also wanted the government to make them permanent employees.
