Their first outing together three years ago was talked about as much for its storyline and music, as for the unmistakable chemistry between them. Now, as   and   join hands once again for Shaad Ali’s upcoming romantic drama  , expectations are high, if not higher. 

 So, what’s it that makes their screen chemistry so natural? Aditya is the first one to answer. “It doesn’t happen consciously; we don’t give too much thought to it. Even during   2, we found an ease and understanding before the camera very organically. When we teamed up for this film, it felt like meeting an old friend and picking up from where we left,” he says. Nodding in agreement, Shraddha adds, “We developed a natural camaraderie right from the beginning.” 
 
 The actors say that OK Jaanu, which will see them playing live-in partners who discover their relationship over a period of time, is an extension of their real-life dosti. “While shooting, we actually discovered a lot about each other. It felt like we were almost playing ourselves on screen,” beams Aditya.
 
 He has every reason to be happy. With their individual hectic schedules, it’s not every day that actors find friends. “I would give us a lot of credit for keeping in touch despite tiring work hours, but these things happen on instinct. With some people, the friendship evolves naturally,” Shraddha points out. 
 
 Aditya agrees, adding, “It’s rare to find time to hang out with friends. As actors, we don’t even meet too many new people. I push the boundaries in that sense because I make time for football apart from many other things. Besides, Shraddha and I have friends outside showbiz, which I think keeps us grounded.”
