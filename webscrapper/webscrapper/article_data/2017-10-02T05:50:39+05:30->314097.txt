AHMEDABAD: Barely five months had passed since the founding of   by Mahatma Gandhi in October 1920. 

 Many individuals from Ahmedabad — businessmen, lawyers, teachers, government servants — had begun contributing towards Bapu’s dream university. Many individuals had begun door-to-door fund raising drive in the city. 
 
 However, a word of caution came from Sardar Vallbahbhai Patel advising all citizens engaged in the drive.
 
 Sardar warned that many dubious groups had involved young children to collect funds from people across the city.
 
 “In the February 27, 1921 edition of the Navajivan journal, Sardar Patel cautioned Amdavadis that “a fake group — an organisation had deployed small children with boxes to collect funds for Vidyapith. 
 
 Such children are not authorised to collect funds for the university,” said city-based  . Sardar later wrote in the note that every individual authorised to collect funds has been provided with an identity document. 
 
 The university was founded on October 18, 1920 as a ‘Rashtriya Vidyapith’ by Mahatma Gandhi, who would serve throughout his life as its chancellor.
