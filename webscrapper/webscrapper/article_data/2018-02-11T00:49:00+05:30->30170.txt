Trichy: Deputy chief minister O Pannerselvam’s ‘dharma yuddam’ (vow taken to protect truth) was just theatrics, said TTV Dhinakaran.

 Commenting on Panneerselvam's statement that his dharma yuddam was successful since the two warring factions came together after keeping out the Mannargudi family, Dhinakaran said “it was not a dharma yuddam, but merely a show which was executed by him for political gain.”
 
 Dhinakaran also alleged that there was widespread irregularity in the appointment of noon meal workers in Thanjavur district. Since some officials were also reportedly involved in the scam, he warned that the district collector too may have to answer for this.
 
 He again reiterated that sleeper cells would emerge only at the time of the no-confidence motion in the assembly. He also alleged that the present government in Tamil Nadu has been functioning as another branch of the BJP.
 
 “Police have started to arrest my supporters in false cases. All the happenings were only because the people from RK Nagar cast their votes in favour of me,” he alleged.
 
 “A number of ongoing projects which were announced by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa in RK Nagar has been stalled abruptly, only because they voted for me,” he said.
