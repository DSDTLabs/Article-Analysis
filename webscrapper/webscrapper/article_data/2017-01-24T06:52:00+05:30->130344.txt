LUCKNOW: The two   (TBMs), called 'Ganga' and ' ', for constructing 3.5km-long underground Metro corridor were launched on Monday.

 The machines, manufactured by a Hong Kong-based company, were brought from Delhi about 2 months ago. Officials said the contractor has tested the TBMs that were used for   tunnelling work.
 
 The first TBM, Gomti, has been assembled 18-metre deep inside the launching shaft of Sachivalaya Station.
 
 While Gomti was launched for cutting soil on `Up' Line on Monday, Ganga is in the advanced stage of assembling and would start the tunnelling work on the `Down' Line by the first week of March.
 
 The TBMs would first dig the tunnel for Hazratganj's underground station till May 2017, and then come out of its underground shaft. They will be launched again from Sachivalaya station's shaft from reverse side to cut soil till Hussainganj underground station.
