GUWAHATI: The Gauhati high court on Thursday asked police to furnish the case diary on a coal smuggling racket involving district transport officials within March 20, the day when it will take up the matter for hearing. The HC also didn't take any decision on the anticipatory bail pleas of six district transport officials wanted by the CID for questioning in connection with the scam. 

 Last week, the CID began investigating the case and summoned the six officials whose names allegedly surfaced following a preliminary probe into the seizure of two overloaded coal-laden trucks from the city's   area. The lorries had allegedly crossed the check-gate undetected in connivance with some transport officials, a source said.
 
 Of the six officials, enforcement inspector Chitra Kumar Nath reportedly reached the CID office on Thursday morning. However, the CID surprisingly did not interrogate Nath saying that investigation officials were busy in a separate operation. "Nath has been asked to pay a visit again," said a source in the CID.
 
 The other five officials are Tapuram Bora, Anurag Shandilya, Bedanta Gogoi, Mrigendra Sarma and Madhab Neog. All of them are yet to respond to the summons of the CID, which has asked them to appear before the investigation team at the earliest. On Wednesday, the CID questioned DTO (enforcement) Prasenjit Kr Ghosh who informed the agency that the surveillance system at the Koinadhara check gate was not foolproof.
