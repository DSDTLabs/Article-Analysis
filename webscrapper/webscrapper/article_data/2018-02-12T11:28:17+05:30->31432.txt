VISAKHAPATNAM: With the incumbent registrar of   V Umamaheswara Rao completing three years in office on February 14, a debate has started on whether Prof Rao will be replaced by another professor. 

 In his second term as registrar, Prof Rao has now held the post for three years and four months. As per existing norms, a person can serve as registrar of a state university for a maximum of six years. According to varsity sources, replacement of Prof Rao may not be on the cards as he happens to be the seniormost registrar among all the state varsities and also because of his administrative experience.
 
 Prof Rao was first appointed registrar in October 2012 when Prof P George Victor was the in-charge vice-chancellor of Andhra University. However, his first term was limited to four months. Later, in February 2015, he assumed the registrar’s office again when Prof GSN Raju was the vice-chancellor. The duo proved to be successful in their efforts, from bagging NAAC-A grade for the university with a CGPA of 3.6 on a 4-point scale to restoring the greenery and infrastructure after Hudhud. After the retirement of Prof GSN Raju and later with in-charge vice-chancellor Prof EA Narayana, Prof Rao is currently working alongside incumbent vice-chancellor  . A senior professor of the varsity said Prof Rao was appointed through the approval of the executive committee in 2015. 
 
 “A prof from the geology department is the frontrunner for the post. However, we are currently expecting no change until Prof Rao turns 62 next year, when he will reach his superannuation age. The registrar’s position of Andhra University has attained greater importance in the functioning of the varsity, which is not the case with other universities. The existing vice-chancellor Prof G Nageswara Rao and registrar Prof Rao have streamlined many things in the last one year with great coordination. We hope this will continue in the future,” the professor said.
