PANCHKULA: Fire department workers protested against state government demanding facilities like government officials outside the fire station at Sector 5 on Wednesday.

 Their prime demand from the government was that they want the authorities to hire them as permanent staff instead of hiring their contractual services.
 
 One of the protesters,  , said, “Government should hire us as permanent staff as we are working here from a long time and have gathered good experience too.”
 
 Another protester said, “We have submitted a memorandum to the government mentioning our demands. We will raise our voice if the government does not fulfil our demands.”
