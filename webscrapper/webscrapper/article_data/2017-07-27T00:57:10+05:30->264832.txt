Erode: Unable to pay   to higher officials, a government jeep driver committed suicide in Bhavani taluk in Erode district. The driver has blamed his higher officials for taking the extreme step in a suicide note. 

 The deceased has been identified as J Balamurugan, of Lakshmi Nagar in Bhavani taluk. He was working as the jeep driver in the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) in Coimbatore division. The deceased was survived by his wife Prema and nine-year-old daughter.
 
 According to the Chithode police, Balamurugan committed suicide on Monday. “Only on Wednesday his family got the suicide note written by him with the names of the officials on it,” the police said.
 
 In his two-page suicide note, Balamurugan had said that he had paid Rs 40,000 as bribe to get transferred to Erode so that he can work from his native village. After receiving the bribe, the TNSTC officials had transferred and posted Balamurugan as a bus driver. Shocked over this, Balamurugan again approached his higher officials demanding them to transfer him as a jeep driver. “But, the higher officials again demanded him to pay another Rs 40,000 as bribe to transfer him as the jeep driver,” the police said.
 
 Upset over this, Balamurugan wrote a detailed suicide note on July 22. In the last part of the suicide note, he had informed Chithode police stating that he was going to end his life by jumping in front of a train.
