Madurai: The Ram Rajya rath yatra, which passed through Madurai reached its final destination, Rameswaram on Wednesday evening. It was given a grand welcome by cadre of the BJP and several Hindu outfits.

 National secretary of the BJP, H Raja, who witnessed the rathâ€™s departure from Madurai on Wednesday said it had received good response from the people and the results are visible from the large crowds who stood on the roadsides and also took photographs in front of it. Stating that even Mahatma Gandhi had advocated Ram Rajya and that is what people wanted, Raja said that by opposing the yatra, opposition parties have only brought it more publicity.
 
 Raja also said that DMK leader M K Stalin and his allies who has opposed this yatra will only lose the votes of the Hindus, who want Ram Rajya to be established in the country. He lauded the AIADMK-led Tamil Nadu government for making special arrangements and police support to ensure that the rath passed peacefully through the state.
 
 In Rameswaram, many pilgrims stood in queues and offered worship. The rath was later taken around the car streets of the Sri Ramanathaswamy temple and was stopped near the Hanuman temple. 
 
 After the rath went around the temple, a public meeting was held. Leaders of VHP and other Hindu outfits along with the organisers addressed the gathering. Krishnananda Saraswathi of the society said the yatra passed through four states without any problem. Stating that only in Tamil Nadu it encountered opposition, he said there was no need for protest.
 
 The yatra will leave for Dhanushkodi on Thursday morning, on its return journey.
