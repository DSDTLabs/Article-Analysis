Soon after his daughter went missing, the victim’s father, a mason, filed a complaint with   police and even said he suspected Anand. “Anand is a known man to my daughter,” the father said in his complaint. “We saw him trying to lure my daughter with clothes and gifts. We strongly suspect Anand has taken away my daughter.”
 
 Three days later, the victim returned home. “Anand had taken the victim to a hotel near Kanakapura where he raped her,” Puttenahalli police said. “He had warned her of dire consequences if she revealed the incident to anyone, but the girl told her mother. We changed the FIR to rape and also charged Anand under Pocso.”
