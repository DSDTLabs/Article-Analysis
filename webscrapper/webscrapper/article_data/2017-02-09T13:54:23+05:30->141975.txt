 “NFDC had only discussed a proposal for a campaign to promote awareness about eye ailments. They told us they plan to rope in a celebrity for the campaign.But there was no approval taken for Shah Rukh Khan or any other celebrity . The videos were shot without our knowledge,“ a health ministry official said.
 
 Another official told TOI that NFDC had discussed the proposal with the ministry and wanted to do the project with  , who played the role of a blind man in recently released movie `Kaabil'. “It would have made sense as Kaabil is film related to blindness and an eye-care campaign can be linked to it. There was no proposal discussed around Shah Rukh for the campaign,“ the official said.
 
 Sources said the campaign has now been shelved for the time being. The campaign was initially planned on conditions like glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy that lead to loss of vision.
 
 Health Minister JP Nadda is particularly unhappy that the ministry was not consulted before finalising the celebrity to endorse the campaign. The ministry's “first choice“ was Roshan.because of the role he played in Kaabil. The ministry had also planned to associate the campaign with the release of the movie.
