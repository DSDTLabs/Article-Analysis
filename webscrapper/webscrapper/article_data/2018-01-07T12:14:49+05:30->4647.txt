SURAT:  , Bhavnagar and Ahmedabad have been summoned by Goods and   (GST) and central excise department authorities in Mumbai following Thursday’s crackdown on angadias and seizure of more than 125 packets containing diamonds and   jewellery on tax evasion suspicion. 

 Official sources said around 125 parcels containing diamonds and gold jewellery were seized from 80 courier firms at   railway station during the crackdown. The couriers were also carrying cash to be delivered to parties in Mumbai. 
 
 Investigation revealed that some of the parcels were genuine as applicable duties and tax were paid, but majority of them were without proper papers. While genuine parcels were released on Friday, the department seized those on which duties were not paid. 
 
 The Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) had represented the issue to Union finance minister and concerned authorities in New Delhi following the crackdown in Mumbai on angadia firms. The GJEPC had received assurance that genuine parcels will be released. 
 
 Industry sources said majority of parcels containing diamonds and jewellery belong to unscrupulous traders, who may have resorted to improper tax compliance methods. 
 
 The GST on jewellery, silver and polished diamonds is 3 per cent, while rough diamonds are taxed at 0.25 per cent. 
 
 GJEPC regional chairman Dinesh Navadiya told TOI, “The GST and central excise department have released genuine parcels, while those without papers have been confiscated. The owners of the parcels have been summoned in Mumbai on Monday. The department will give them opportunity to prove their claims on the parcels and ask them to pay duties and fines as applicable.”
