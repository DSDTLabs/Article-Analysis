MUNGER: Beacon lights fitted atop VIP vehicles have become a bone of contention between elected heads of the   and the Munger civic body on the one hand and the district transport officer (DTO) on the other.

 A team led by Munger DTO Mohd   removed the red   from the four-wheelers of   chairperson Pinki Devi and Munger Municipal Corporation’s Mayor   when the vehicles were parked outside the district collectorate on Friday evening. The transport officials also realised Rs 100 each as fine from the drivers. 
 
 The women representatives were inside the collectorate, attending a meeting with DM Uday Kumar Singh at that time.
 
 Pinki Devi later said the DTO’s action amounted to humiliating elected representatives. “I could know about it only when I came out of the meeting,” she said, alleging the DTO intentionally wanted to humiliate her and that was why he hadn’t bothered to give her a prior notice.
 
 She recalled it was the district administration which had given her the government vehicle fitted with a beacon light after she was elected the Zila Parishad chairperson in June last year. “No one ever told me to remove the beacon,” she said.
 
 Kumkum Devi also alleged the DTO intentionally tried to sully the image of two women public representatives. She admitted she was not entitled to use the beacon, but claimed she was using it because police officers holding posts equivalent to hers were using beacons in several districts. 
 
 DTO Nazir Ahmed, however, denied the allegations. “We routinely remove beacons from vehicles of people not entitled to use them whenever and wherever we see such vehicles,” he said.
 
 Asked if his office had served any notice to the Zila Parishad chairperson and Mayor, the DTO replied in the negative. “They are holding high posts. They should not have waited for any notice, but should have voluntarily removed the beacons in the light of court orders and subsequent government orders,” he said.
