ICICI Bank’s shares gained almost 7% on Tuesday after the lender’s CEO Chanda   announced aggressive targets to reduce bad loans and a new strategy to cut large corporate exposures and grow retail loans. Tuesday also saw the bank’s board approve the budget and planning for the new ‘preserve, change and grow’ strategy.
 
 The second day of the board meet, which was again skipped by government nominee   and   chairman  , did not see any discussions on Kochhar’s conflict of interest issue. 
 
 This pertains to the bank’s loans to Videocon Group, which is alleged to have invested in a firm led by Kochhar’s husband. At Tuesday’s closing price of Rs 309, the lender’s stock is still nearly 16% lower than its 52-week high of Rs 366 in January-end.
 
 According to a research report by Edelweiss, the bank’s new strategy is aimed at de-risking its portfolio by preserving its strong funding base and digital leadership, changing the corporate lending approach and growing core profits and retail loans. Some analysts felt that the allegations of conflict of interest would continue to be an overhang in the short term.
 
 Sharekhan AVP (research)   said, “For the longer term, we are positive on the stock due to attractive valuations.”
