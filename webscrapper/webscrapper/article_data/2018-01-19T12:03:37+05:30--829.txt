The   (IRS) 2017, released on Thursday, has confirmed once again that The   is the countryâ€™s favourite English language publication, by a whopping margin. 

 In fact, with a total readership of over 1.3 crore, TOI is not only far ahead of the competition, it also has more readers than the No. 2, Hindustan Times (68.47 lakh) and No. 3, The   (53 lakh) put together. 
 
 The fourth and fifth-largest English newspapers are also both sister publications of TOI. While Economic Times has a total readership of 31.03 lakh, the figure for Mumbai Mirror is 18.13 lakh.   thus has three of the five most read English dailies in India in its stable.
