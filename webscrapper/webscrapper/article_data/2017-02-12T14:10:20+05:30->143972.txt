MADURAI: An explosion at a   near Sattur in   killed two workers on Saturday. A woman worker was also injured in the  , which turned a working shed into rubble, police sources said.

 The victims were identified as M Sekar, 50, from  , 50, from Nadusoorankudi, workers at the Devibala   Unit, situated at Vaniyampatti near Elayirampannai. The unit manufactures fancy-type fireworks, a police officer said. “About 200 people from villages in and around Elayirampannai are employed at the 50 working sheds of the unit. The accident occurred around 9.35am as soon as the shift began. While both the workers were killed on the spot, A Marieammal from Anbinagaram suffered injuries and is undergoing treatment at the Sattur Government Hospital. Her condition is stable as she has not suffered burn injuries but was struck by flying debris. Other workers managed to flee from the spot,” the officer told TOI.
 
 This is the second accident in the area in recent times as eight workers were killed in a blast at RR Fireworks at Kongaraipatti, situated just one kilometre away from Saturday’s accident site, on December 26, 2016.
 
 The access roads to the fireworks units are in a bad condition, making rescue works difficult, said M Mahalakshmi, district secretary of Fireworks Workers Association in Sivakasi, who visited the accident spot. “It is intriguing how there was a blast at a working shed when the shift was about to start. Early shift accidents usually occur in chemical mixing rooms – where chemicals are prepared for fireworks making – not at working sheds. Mixed chemicals from the previous day could have been left in the working shed. As decaying chemicals cause accidents, the chemical mixture prepared for the day is exhausted by the end of the day and any leftover is destroyed as per the norms,” Mahalakshmi said.
 
 Elayirampannai police have registered a case and are investigating the incident. They have booked cases against factory foreman K Samuthirakani and owner M Sujatha.
