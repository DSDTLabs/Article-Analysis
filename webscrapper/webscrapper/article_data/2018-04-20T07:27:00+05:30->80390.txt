Ludhiana: Having realized the urgent need to start reconstruction of one side of Jagraon Bridge, MP Ravneet Bittu gave the MC officials 20 days to complete shifting of encroachers from the land near the bridge to Giaspura flats. The encroachers will also have to pay 10% cost of the flat to MC to take possession of the flats.

 Congress MP Ravneet Bittu in the review and monitoring committee meeting on Thursday asked the civic officials to complete the process of shifting of encroachers from the railway land within given time frame because the railways has started soil testing at the site and contractor has also started setting up barricades at the site.
 
 Additional commissioner Sanyam Aggarwal raised the issue of recovery of 10% cost of flats from the encroachers and also claimed that people were demanding flats in Mundian Kalan while they have flats ready in Giaspura. He said these flats were constructed under Jawahar Lal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), therefore there is one condition that allottees will have to pay 10% cost of the flat which is approximately Rs 30,000.
 
 Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal told the MC officials to arrange for some bank loans for those people and shift them to the Giaspura flats as soon as possible.
 
 MLA Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the land belongs to railways and encroachers will have to shift somewhere else.
 
 Notably, the construction of one side of Jagraon bridge is eagerly awaited and the shifting of encroachers from this land has become a major hurdle in this project. Recently the MP and other MLAs had also visited the site to convince people to leave the place and shift to these flats, but people were demanding for land instead of flats.
