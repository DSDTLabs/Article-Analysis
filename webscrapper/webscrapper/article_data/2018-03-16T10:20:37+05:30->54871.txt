CHANDIGARH: In order to reduce the rush to PGIMER from neighbouring states, PGIMER authorities said they have asked Punjab, Haryana and   to strengthen their medical services and have also offered to help them by training their doctors to handle less critical patients. However, no response has been received from the three states as a result of which the rush in PGI continues to shoot up 

 "The rush will be reduced in PGI only if the peripheral services of neighbouring states will be strengthened," said director of   during a meeting organised by him with the media on competition of one year as a director of PGIMER. "The health officials of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh have been given a proposal that the PGI is ready to provide training to the medical personnel, including doctors, technicians or other, so that they can strengthen their medical facilities. All we can do is request them to come and get trained at PGI," said Prof Jagat Ram. Presently the number of patients visiting PGI is more than 11,000, which was 8,000 till last year.
 
 He added that they have requested ministry of family health and welfare and health minister to waive off the amount or reduce the amount of 55 acre of land which they have to acquire. "It is costing us Rs 1,100 crore and we have requested them to lower it to around Rs 200 crore. This will help in diverting the rush."
 
  also said the doctors have been asked to reach OPD's on time to clear the OPD rush efficiently and quickly, "Efforts have been made to contact and hold meetings with the neighbouring states and have requested their appropriate authorities to strengthen their internal system, so that overburdening of referrals which otherwise can be avoidable medically should not come on to PGI," said deputy director administration (DDA) at PGI Amitabh Avasthi.
