 On Wednesday, Sensex advanced by 103 points to end at 35,319.35 as healthy buying in frontline stocks offset lacklustre global cues.

 Brent crude futures rose 0.7 per cent to $77.76 a barrel in early trade, the highest since November 2014 and building on gains of about 3 per cent on Wednesday. US light crude futures rose 0.8 per cent.
 
 Energy shares soared as crude oil prices reached 3-1/2-year highs, with investors betting the US withdrawal from a nuclear agreement with Iran would increase tensions in the Middle East and curtail oil supply.
