AURANGABAD: Plans for grand   celebrations on Saturday across the city were marred because of the riots overnight and prevailing tension. 

 Rakhamaji Jadhav, the owner and operator of Cantonment based Jadhav Mandap and Decorators, said the wedding celebrations were subdued and devoid of usual fervour because of the tension in the city. 
 
 “Though the weddings I catered to were not cancelled or postponed, most of the parties decided to drop the band and fancy music. The weddings in the old city area were conducted without the baraat procession,” Jadhav said.
 
 Rohit Thokal, a DJ, who plays music at weddings, said the ceremonies on Saturday morning were low key and without any celebrations. He said that the celebrations in hotels were not as badly affected. 
 
 Considering the law and order situation, people travelling to and from the city to nearby locations deferred their plans to avoid any untoward circumstances in wake of the tense situation. The families had to conduct the weddings with the absence of outstation guests and relatives, Jadhav said. 
 
 Dolphin Travels, a tour operator on Jalna Road, said that cancellations of hotels, trains and bus tickets swelled as the reports about clashes spread on social media by Saturday morning.
 
 However, by Saturday evening, the wedding fever caught momentum and celebrations resumed in parts of the city that were not severely affected such as Shivaji Nagar, Garkheda, Cidco, Hudco and Railway Station Road. 
 
 Ashok Munde, a security personal serving at a wedding on Saturday evening, said that the event had begun on the usual jovial note and was under way in full enthusiasm. Guests also started arriving in good numbers.
