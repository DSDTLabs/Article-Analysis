NEW DELHI: An   from Birmingham to Delhi was grounded by a rare fault on Saturday — the Dreamliner’s public address (PA) system developed a snag.

 An aircraft is not allowed to operate without a working PA system as it is needed to convey information to passengers should an emergency arise. While the issue was rectified in a few hours, AI was still trying to figure out on Sunday if the flight could be operated that night.
 
 “Since the crew and passengers were at the airport, they were made to board in the hope that the PA system would be rectified soon,” said a source, adding that stalling boarding until the snag was resolved would have delayed the flight.
 
 In doing so, apart from trying to dodge Europe’s nighttime flight restrictions, the airline was looking to avoid breaching the pilots’ and the crew’s flight duty time limitation (FDTL). Meanwhile, AI rushed one of its most experienced technicians to Birmingham. “But by the time he repaired the PA system, the crew’s FDTL had kicked in and the flight could not operate late Saturday night-Sunday morning,” said a source.
 
 On Sunday, the flight was stalled amid a dilemma over whether the same pilots could be scheduled for flights on two consecutive nights.
