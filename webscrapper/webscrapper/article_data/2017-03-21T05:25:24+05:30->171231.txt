GURUGRAM: Students appearing in the CBSE Class XII examination gave a mixed response about Monday's Mathematics paper, with some saying the paper was unexpectedly lengthy. Nearly all students TOI spoke with said they failed to complete answering the paper due to paucity of time. 

 “It wasn’t too difficult. However, in the paper's Section A, the objective-type questions carrying 1 mark each required lengthy calculations,” said Adhwan Kapoor of DPS Sector 45. “Also, I did not like the new pattern,” Kapoor said, adding the difficulty level was not very challenging. “We’re generally apprehensive about the   paper. Compared to the last five years, it was relatively easy today,” said Arya Dewan, also of DPS Sector 45. “I was happy 80% of the paper came from the   syllabus, of which 60% were direct questions. The problem many students faced was because of the frequency of questions that required ‘higher-order thinking’, for which one needs to be clear about concepts and well-versed in examples from reference books.”
 
 Dewan, too, admitted the paper was lengthy. “I don’t think anyone completed it. I missed two questions. One carried 6 marks, the other 2.”
 
 But there were others who felt the paper was a cakewalk. “The paper was moderately difficult. Many of my classmates said they were happy with the questions.,” said Anubhav Alawat of   in Sector 15.
