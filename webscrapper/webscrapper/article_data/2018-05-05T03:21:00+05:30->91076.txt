Mapusa: A local court on Friday adjourned a plea filed by Tehelka founder-editor Tarun   in an alleged rape case, seeking additional documents in the case from prosecution.

 On April 17, since the issue was technical, the court had adjourned the case to May 4 for the government expert to be heard. “The government expert could not come because of prior appointments in Delhi. Now the matter has been adjourned to June 11 for the expert to be heard on the application moved by the defence,” assistant public prosecutor, advocate Cyndiana Silva said.
 
 The Mapusa court, in September 2017, framed charges against Tejpal for raping a junior colleague in a five-star hotel at Bambolim in November 2013. Tejpal had pleaded not guilty, paving the way for a trial. 
 
 The in-camera trial in the case had commenced on March 15. In the four-year-old alleged rape case against Tarun Tejpal, the survivor completed her deposition before additional sessions judge Vijaya Pol at Mapusa on March 16.
