PUNE: The   are planning to re-classify various   which have been encroached upon by the   ( ) for municipal purposes. 

 The local defence estates office (DEO) has given nod to re-categorise six parcels of land in the Cantonment which are under its management. The land, measuring three acres, has been encroached upon in multiple ways.
 
 "One of these plots is located near the Ambedkar school in Solapur Bazar, while the other at the Chimta Basti in Ghorpadi. A parcel of land upon near Poona College is also facing encroachment. These spots have either been used to park vehicles illegally, or to dump construction materials and garbage," said DN Yadav, PCB chief executive officer.
 
 The re-classification will convert the B-4 land to Class "C" land, as per the nomenclature of the defence estates department of the   (MoD). Such land can be used for municipal purposes.
 
 Yadav said that civic purposes can include sanitation facilities or beautification. "For now, we plan to install mobile latrines at some of these plots. Other locations would be used to build gardens. The plot near Ambedkar school will be converted into a playground," he said. This process, however, requires MoD's approval, and officials believe that this might take another year.
