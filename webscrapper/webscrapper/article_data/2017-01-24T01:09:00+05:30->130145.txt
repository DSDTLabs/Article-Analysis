MUMBAI: The Congress leadership on Monday deployed   Bhupinder Singh Hooda to pacify the warring factions after taking cognisance of a war of words on social media. Some leaders in the party have targeted   chief  

 Nirupam confirmed to TOI that Hooda will be in the city on Wednesday to take of the situation in view of the BMC polls. Nirupam’s arch-enemy and former Congress MP Gurudas Kamat tweeted that he felt sad to see second-generation Congressmen forced to leave the organisation. Kamat added that there seemed to be a deliberate attempt by Nirupam and AICC general secretary Mohan Prakash to drive people out while Rahul Gandhi is busy with the Uttar Pradesh elections. Senior Congress leader Krishna Hegde left, but no attempts were made to stop him or others who left the Congress. Hegde was elected to the state legislative assembly in 2009 from the Vile Parle constituency, however, he lost the 2014 polls. Hegde blamed Nirupam for his “autocratic” style of functioning. “Nirupam can not lead the party in Mumbai, therefore I am quitting,” Hegde said.
 
 Former Union minister Milind Deora too tweeted that on the eve of the polls leaders must unite for the party and the people, failing which the party should pull up habitual saboteurs. Deora did not name any leader of the Congress for sabotaging the organization. 
 
 Meanwhile, politicians from other parties are making a beeline for the BJP. Three sitting corporators (one each from Congress, MNS and an independent) and a former MNS MLA joined the BJP on Monday. BJP city unit chief Ashish Shelar inducted former MNS MLA Mangesh Sangle, Congress corporator Parminder Bhamra (Malad), MNS corporator Bhalchandra Ambore (Jogeshwari) and independent Leena Shukla (Chandivli).
