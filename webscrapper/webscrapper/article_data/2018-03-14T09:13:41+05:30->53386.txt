CHANDIGARH: I-League champions   on Tuesday said they will pay salaries of domestic players as soon as they receive their dues from the All India Football Federation ( ).

 
 Henna Bajaj, the co-owner of I-League champions Minerva Punjab, has rejected the claims of being under any financial burden. She told TOI that the salaries of all the domestic players will be disbursed within a week.
 
 ”Yes, it’s true that some of the players did not get their salaries for the last month. We will clear the dues as soon as we can. We are targetting by end of next week. We have some dues from AIFF and as soon as we get that, we will move ahead with payment of players,” Minerva owner Ranjit Bajaj’s wife Henna told TOI.
 
 The source close to the team management had also said that the owners will be off to Maldives on vacation leaving the players in the lurch. Henna denied such allegations, saying they will stay put until the players’ salaries issue is resolved. “We are not going to Maldives. We are staying here and our priority is to clear the dues of the players,” she said.
 
 The foreign players, though, have received their remuneration, the source added. The AIFF still owes them part of the subsidy money and some other allowances, Henna said. The prize money of Rs 1 crore for winning the I-League is also due.
 
 “We met Mr (Sunando) Dhar, I-League CEO, today and he assured us that the money would come soon. We are a little cash strapped but the effort is there to pay the salaries as soon as we can,” Henna said.
 
 Minerva’s financial plight has also been highlighted in their refusal to take part in the Super Cup. Henna though sounded optimistic about playing the Super Cup. “We are likely to take part in the Super Cup. We had a few reservations. However, the meeting today was fruitful,” she said.
 
 The Super Cup qualifiers will start from March 31and the final round will go on till April 20. Minerva are scheduled to play their first match against Jamshedpur on April 2.
