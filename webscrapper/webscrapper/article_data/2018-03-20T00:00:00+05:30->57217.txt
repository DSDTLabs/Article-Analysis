Happening, trendy, mastilicious, music-heavy, high on food and drinks — this   was all that and more. These party animals enjoyed every bit of this do and that was evident when they posed animatedly for the shutterbugs and danced with full energy in sync with the music. 

 Ladies were dressed smartly, but we must say that comfort overruled fashion. Most of them were in short, no-hassle dresses, considering the hot and humid Chennai weather. While they spent most of the time on the dance floor, they didn’t miss trying out scrumptious eats and lip-smacking drinks on the menu. By the time they were done, they had already planned the next party outing.
