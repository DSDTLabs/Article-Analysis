CHENNAI: More than a year after Alandur court officials attached movable property from the state highways divisional engineer's office in Pallavaram, the  ,   remain dumped in a public space under the   bridge, even though the case that led to the seizure has been resolved. 

 In November 2016, officials had attached the furniture at the Pallavaram office of the divisional engineer (projects) after the highways department failed to compensate landowners whose land was acquired for the work on the bridge connecting the   (GST) Road with the Pallavaram-Thoraipakkam Radial Road. But instead of being stored in a proper facility, the furniture was abandoned under the bridge, popularly called Pond's Bridge.
 
 "We had moved the court for a higher compensation than what was promised to us. Finally, three months ago, we got our compensation amounting to Rs. 13 crore, after all the appeals," said one of the 18 landowners involved in the case, requesting anonymity.
 
 The seized items are good pieces of furniture that could still be used in offices or donated to places which need it, civic activists pointed out. "  like this in the open is a waste," said V Santhanam, a civic activist.
 
 Officials from the highways department said they were unaware of the property being dumped there. "It comes under the purview of the projects wing," said an official.
