  "It was like, 'Oh, I know the answer to that question', because I've sat here for three years from a different perspective. Everybody has to say 'yes' to you. It was really really fun, I really enjoyed it. We have an amazing cast, so being able to work with them in that way was really fun."
  
  One of the castmates, who helped McKenzie realise his directing dream was his fiance, Morena Baccarin. She plays Leslie Thompkins on "Gotham".
