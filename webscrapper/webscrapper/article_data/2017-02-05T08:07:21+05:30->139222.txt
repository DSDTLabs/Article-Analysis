BHOPAL: Bankura girl   was not Udayan Das's first victim. After making contradictory statements about the whereabouts of his parents, the 32-year-old youth told cops on Saturday that he had killed his parents in Raipur six years ago and buried the bodies on the premises of their house.

 Udayan was arrested on Friday for killing 28-year-old Akansha, his live-in partner. He had put her body in a trunk and poured layers of concrete mixture over it, creating a horrific tomb in his Bhopal house. Cops dug for hours on Thursday night to retrieve a skeleton from the tomb which they believe is Akansha's.Udayan has confessed to killing her.
 
 Superintendent of police Siddharth Bahuguna said a joint team of Bhopal and Bengal police will go to Raipur on Sunday to verify his claim. “If it turns out to be true, a separate case will be registered against him in Rai pur,“ he said. Police said Udayan has been changing his statements frequently.
 
 Udayan had earlier told the police that his father had died two years ago and his mother was working as a volunteer with Unicef in the US. He also gave a number to the police to contact his mother in the US, but there was no response, police sources said.
 
 “When police called the number at around 10 pm on Friday, it didn't connect.When some senior officers joined the interrogation and grilled him, he said he had killed his parents too," an official said.
