AHMEDABAD: Ever since the launch of Ahmedabad’s   in October 2009, it has bagged three national and seven international trophies for the state government to flaunt, apart from decorating the CVs of senior bureaucrats and politicians. But today, nine years later, the BRTS network, now worth Rs 1,200 crore, stands where it stood in 2009.

 The figures give it away. The 88.8-km BRTS coverage has, in fact, cut citizens’ total usage of the   by nearly 18% — defeating the very purpose of the mass transit system. Interestingly, the city's vehicle population increased to 43 lakh in 2017 up from 23.7 lakh in 2009. Critics also point out the failure in tackling crucial issues like last mile connectivity for public transport, free parking, subsidised road taxes, integrating BRTS with other public transport systems as reasons behind the traffic problems as well.
 
  
  “Last mile connectivity is the key to motivate people to use public transport systems such as the BRTS and the   reducing traffic congestion during peak hours,” added a senior   ( ) official.
 
 Over the last few years, even AMTS passenger ridership has not increased much. Nearly 750 AMTS buses ply on city roads every day, each running an average of 190km. The average fuel consumption of these buses is anywhere between 5km per litres for mini buses and 3km per litre for larger AMTS buses. A senior official of   (AJL), the governing body for BRTS services, told TOI, “After initiation of wi-fi services, we are seeing an upward movement in BRTS ridership. A large number of students and young executives and women have taken to travelling in BRTS. Very soon, we plan to integrate auto-rickshaws into the network to improve last mile connectivity,” says the AJL official.
