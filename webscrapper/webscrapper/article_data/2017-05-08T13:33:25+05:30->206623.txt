PATIALA: Perturbed over  's (PUDA) plan to chop 149 trees around a heritage structure, the old PWD (public health) department building, Punjab minister for local government   has asked the authorities concerned not to carry out any alterations around the structure. Sidhu asked the state directorate of culture affairs, archaeology and museums to shoot off a letter to PUDA, asking it to desist from carrying out any developmental work at the building site as the structure and the area around it was protected under section 4 (i) of the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1964. 

 The letter, a copy of which is available with the TOI, asks PUDA not to carry out any type of development activity, including demolition, construction, re-construction, alterations and cutting of trees in the old PWD (public health) building. The letters also underlines that all other buildings near fountain chowk, where this building is located, and the land surrounding these were protected under the said Act. Sidhu was not available for comments but local lawyer Sourabh Kapoor, who raised the issue with him, said Sidhu was particularly upset with the fact that despite a ban ordered by the   (NGT) on felling of trees across the state and also a stay ordered by the Punjab and Haryana high court on any alterations of the building, PUDA had floated tenders to cut the trees. Interestingly , the building is located just a stone's throw away from the minister's private residence in  .
 
 The development authority had recently floated tenders to cut down as many as 1,295 tree at three locations in CM's home city after the   gave a four-month relaxation on a ban ordered by the NGT on axing of trees in the entire state to facilitate highways widening projects.Ironically, PUDA and the department of town and country planning showed the area in its drawings as vacant and gave an advertisement to auction the same in April, last year.
 
 Kapoor claimed that as per the law governing the protection of heritage buildings, an area of 100 m around heritage buildings fell under the prohibited zone, where no alterations of any sort could be made.
