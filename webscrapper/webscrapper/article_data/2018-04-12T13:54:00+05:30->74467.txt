NAGPUR: Politics of ‘fast’ will be in play again on Thursday when the   (BJP) MPs will lead protest fast in every constituency against the Opposition parties which allegedly did not allow functioning of Parliament’s second part of the Budget session.   as well as Lok Sabha were continuously disrupted without allowing a single full-day’s functioning.

 The BJP had announced the day the Parliament session was wound up last week that it would hold protests throughout the country to apprise the people of the Opposition’s disruptive politics. But pre-empting the BJP move, the   on Tuesday held a daylong fast led by Rahul Gandhi, who was for a few hours at Rajghat, to protest against the BJP’s politics of hatred and for causing social friction.
 
 The BJP’s protest fast will be staged at RBI Square. Led by Rajya Sabha member Dr Vikas Mahatme and ex-MP  , it will begin at 10am and end at 5pm. BJP legislators and hundreds of party workers are expected to participate, said city BJP spokesman Chandan Goswami. City MP and Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari is unlikely to attend the protest because of other scheduled engagements.
 
 While the Congress ‘fast’ was to target the BJP for its communal politics and growing atrocities on Dalits, the BJP wants to expose the combined Opposition for working against national interests by provoking social unrest to gain lost political ground. While the Congress show, hit by factionalism in the city, lacked public support, the BJP’s fast plan has already attracted much derision on social media as to need for a ruling party to hold public protests against a feeble Opposition.
