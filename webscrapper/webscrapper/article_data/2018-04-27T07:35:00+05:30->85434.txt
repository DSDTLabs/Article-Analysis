Ludhiana: Judicial court complex in Jagraon would soon get a   as the work has commenced. This move is a much-needed booster to the green plastic initiative, which the income tax department has taken in association with the TOI.

 The project that is being supervised by sub-divisional judicial magistrate (SDJM) Pradeep Synghal, would use thousands of plastic bottles to grow plants.
 
 “This is a wonderful project. Along with providing a beautiful spectacle, this vertical garden would also bring down pollution level and temperature of the building where it would installed. I think, more people should come forward and adopt initiatives like these for the environment,” Synghal said
 
 Chief commissioner of income tax Binay K Jha said, “This initiative would not only take care of the plastic waste, but also make the complex more beautiful.”
 
 Jha, whose team is taking care of the entire project, said that the installation of a vertical garden at this important office would also inspire others. “This installation would symbolise that the green plastic initiative movement has made its strides outside Ludhiana as well,” Jha said.
 
 I-T department, Ludhiana, has installed vertical gardens at various places in Ludhiana, Chandigarh and Amritsar. In a bid to counter pollution level, it plans to spread this initiative to other cities in Punjab.
 
 Traditionally, a vertical garden is developed by using plastic or fibre pots, but I-T officials have decided to use discarded plastic bottles instead.
