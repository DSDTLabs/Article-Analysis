THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has given specific instructions that those who are employing foreign agencies for IT and   will have to get prior permission from the central government. 

 In a notification issued by the state government, all the government departments, autonomous bodies, public sector undertakings, universities and other institutions have been urged to take NOCs from the Union home department before seeking the help of foreign agencies since the Indian computer emergency response team has listed out the names of the agencies who can be approached for this.
 
 All the guidelines issued by the home department have to be followed before approaching any agency prescribed in the list and a non-disclosure agreement should be signed by the auditing agency and the auditor. The agency also should not carry the details collected during the auditing outside the government departments and should not be transferred to any other agencies.
