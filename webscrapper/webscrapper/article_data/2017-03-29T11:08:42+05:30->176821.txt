JAIPUR: If the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) orders are enforced by the  , the monsoon of 2017 holds hope for the dying   

 The central zonal bench of NGT has directed the Rajasthan government to cancel allotments of salt pans in Sambhar Salt Lake that fall within the wetland and run contrary to the mandate of Wetland Rules, 2010.
 
 A bench headed by Justice Dalip Singh and expert member Satyawan Singh Garbyal directed the state wetland authority to review the allotments made so far after the submissions of Vinod Kapoor and the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) Committee reports and asked it to submit the compliance report within six months. The bench gave six months’ time to implement the recommendations which should not be later than 2017 monsoon.
 
 “There are over 1,30,00 illegal tube wells in the wetland area stealing brine worth crores. After the NGT order, the police have not been able to remove even a single illegal salt pan. But they are at least not allowing the new ones to come up,” said S P Bansal CMD Hindustan Salts.
 
 Petitioner Ajay Dubey had alleged that in and around the Sambhar Lake, commercial and other activities detrimental to the   of the wetland were being carried out contrary to the provisions of the Wetland (Conservation and Management) Rules framed under the Environment Protection Acts of 1986 and 2010.
 
 The NGT, in the order, has directed the state government not to make any further allotments or permit new salt pans within the wetland areas or in the ‘no construction zone’ identified for the said purpose in accordance with the Wetland Rules, 2010.
 
 The bench, referring to the reports on the matter, directed the authorities to examine the sensitive issue in light of observations and recommendations made by the two expert committees, Vinod Kapoor, IAS in 2010 and NEERI in 2016.
