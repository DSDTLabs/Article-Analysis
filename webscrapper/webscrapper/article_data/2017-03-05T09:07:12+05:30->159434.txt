CHHAPRA: The Centre has released Rs 42 crore of the Rs 382 crore it has sanctioned for restoration of  . The remaining amount would be released in phases.

 Giving this information through a press release, Union skill development minister Rajiv Pratap Rudy said the work would be completed by June next year. Rudy, who had a meeting with deputy CM   recently to discuss the problem of frequent traffic snarls in the town, said the Centre has decided to construct a double-decker fly over at   to address the issue. The minister said the NH-19, which would be linked with Sonepur-Digha rail-cum-road bridge, would come as a major relief for people of western   and neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.
 
 Although work on construction of the NH had begun a decade back, it could not be completed due to funds crunch, court cases and protests by contractors.
