Raai Laxmi, who made her B’town debut last year, is back in   with   2. The film, in which Jai’s playing the lead, has Varalaxmi and   playing pivotal roles, too. The actress says that though the film has a different story compared to Neeya, which released almost four decades ago, there are similarities in terms of its genre. 

 She explains, “Neeya 2 has elements of fantasy, thriller, love, etc. This, too, is a ‘snake film’ like the yesteryear flick. I will be seen in three appearances in the movie; one among them will have a ‘naagin’ look. All the three heroines in the movie appear in different time periods — present, past and future. However, I have combination scenes with the other two.”
 
 Laxmi, who is currently shooting for the second schedule of the film, also avers that she has five projects in her kitty. “I will be announcing my second   project soon. Also, I’m doing a film with   sir in  . This is the fifth or sixth movie I’m doing with him,” she says.
