Ludhiana: Seeking to further improve the quality of water in the Sidhwan canal, a temple society has come foward and is planning a meeting with members of various other temple committees in the city to ensure worship material is not thrown into the canal.

 Giving details, general secretary of Shree Geeta Mata Temple society, Pardeep Dhall said that they are already holding a signature campaign for a ‘Clean and Green Sidhwan canal and Save the Girl Child’ at the temple that was inaugurated by mayor Balkar Sandhu and councillor Mamta Ashu. He added that on the directions of the councilor Ashu, they are contacting various temple committees in the city and astrologers to seek their support on the Clean and Green Sidhwan canal.
 
 The general secretary added that they would be holding a meeting with the members of the temple committees and ask them to create awareness among the devotees on the subject. He added that they will also request the astrologers to suggest remedies other than immersing of the worship material in the Sidhwan canal.
 
 The society member said that they have also approached the Sidhwan Warriors seeking their help to restore the pristine glory of the canal which is the only water body flowing through the heart of city. They added that after the Signature campaign, they will present the boards with signatures to Mayor Balkar Sandhu seeking his support for beautification of canal.
