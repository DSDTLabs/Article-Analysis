LUCKNOW: Panic prevailed in   extension on Saturday when   by diggers burst a PNG (piped natural  )   running underground in the   phase around 12.30 pm .The rupture led to heavy leakage of cooking fuel, putting at risk the lives of over 2,000 people living in about 5-6 apartment buildings in the area. 

 Gomtinagar fire station officer Shesh Nath Yadav said, “We got an alert around 12.55 pm and our vehicle got there in 10 minutes. Fortunately, no fire broke out. We had also alerted the   (GGL) — company in charge of supplying PNG to the city — to fix the pipe.” The pipe was fixed in 90 minutes. Meanwhile, occupants of apartment buildings like Rapti, Betwa, Alaknanda and Kaveri etc; were evacuated to avoid any mishap. Abhilash Bahal, a resident, said, “We were being assured the leakage would be fixed in a few minutes. But it took close to two hours. It was so suffocating to stand that many had to leave the area.”
 
 GGL MD Jiledar said, “There are safety arrangements within the PNG system that as soon as there is any rupture in the pipe, the pressure is automatically lowered, resulting in an automatic closing of the valve, obstructing supply in the pipe and we did so. The pipe was fixed in about an hour and a half, after which a normal supply was resumed to all the apartments.”
 
 While the leakage was being repaired, movement of vehicles was stopped on one side and traffic was diverted on the other. Jiledar said it was advisable to avoid any spark, caused from vehicle movement on road near the site, as hydrocarbons are highly inflammable.
 
 Meanwhile, LDA has ordered its engineers to probe into what damaged the pipeline and fix accountability. LDA vice-chairman Satyendra Singh said, “We have ordered a probe into the accident and culprits would be punished.”
