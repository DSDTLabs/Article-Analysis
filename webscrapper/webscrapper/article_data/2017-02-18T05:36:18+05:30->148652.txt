HYDERABAD: It seems the   Telangana state does not have funds to buy snacks for its students. The education department, in a bizarre appeal, has sought donations to provide snacks to help students excel in the upcoming  .

 In a circular, the department of education which is conducting special classes for Class 10 students in government-run schools, cited poor financial condition of students as a reason for skipping breakfast and said students can't concentrate on their studies in such “miserable" circumstances.
 
 “As you are aware that most of the students in government schools are from financially backward families, and therefore they come to school without having breakfast. Lunch is provided in the school. Due to special classes, they re main in school for ex tended hours on empty stomachs," read a circu lar issued by district educational office, Med chal. It's further mentioned in the circular that “In these miserable circumstances, their focus on academic performance is not adequate. In the circular, the   said, “The district administration has decided to provide tiffin, snacks, sprouts, tea, etc. Hence I request you to provide   either in cash or kind.“
 
 A Usha Rani, DEO of Med chal, said people should see the move as a step to encourage students. “The government already provides mid-day meal, uniforms, books. So, keeping students welfare in mind, we decided to invite local donors so that students who skip breakfast need not go hungry,“ said Rani.She said last year the government gave money for snacks, no funds were allocated this time.
 
 The DEO's move has not gone well with activists. They took a dig at the government for spending crores on 'yagnas', brand ambassadors and advisors, but failing to feed students.
 
 The special classes will end on March 5 and SSC public exams are scheduled to begin on March 14.
