CHANDIGARH: Ten of the 13 fire tenders with the Chandigarh MC’s fire and emergency services department are too old for the road, as they have crossed the 15-year age limit for vehicles to ply in the city. 

 Adding to the woes of the department, the state transport authority ( ) has refused to give permission to allow the fire tenders on the road. ‘
 
 That’s not all. The department might face a shortage of another vital firefigting vehicle in near future. Of the four water boozers with the department, two have crossed the 15-year period. 
 
 Though the STA has said the fire department should use the 10 fire tenders at its own risk,   chief fire officer   said they have already written to the UT secretary (local bodies) to seek permission to allow them to use the fire tenders that are older than 15 years but fit for the road.
 
 Garg said they were waiting for the secretary’s decision on giving extension to the firefighting vehicles. “Since these vehicles do not run on the road like regular ones, we felt it would be unnecessary to spend on buying more such vehicles. We will only replace vehicles which are mechanically unfit,” he said.
 
 Recently, the UT administration issued a circular to all its and MC’s departments to replace old vehicles with new ones. A source in the MC said the STA had refused to allow the MC to continue with the outdated fire tenders a few months ago.
