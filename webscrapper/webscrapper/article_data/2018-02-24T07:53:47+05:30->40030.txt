AMRITSAR: After the unceremonious exit of its chief Charanjit Singh Chadha, Chief   (CKD) is all set to elect its new president, vice-president and secretary on March 4. Three groups in CKD are lobbying to gain control of the 115-year-old Sikh body.

 According to sources, one group is being led by Chadha’s loyalist Santokh Singh, another by Congress-backed officiating president Dhanraj Singh and third by Raj Mohinder Singh Majithia, who has the support of   (SAD).
 
 CKD secretary Narinder Singh Khurana informed TOI on Friday that on the last day of filing nominations, 11 candidates have filed papers for the posts of president, vice-president, and secretary.
 
 Santokh, Majithia, Dhanraj and Nirmal Singh have filed papers for the post of president. Baldev Singh Chohan, Nirmal Singh, Sarbajit Singh and Surinder Singh are contesting for the post of vice-president. Santokh Singh Sethi, Gurinder Singh Chawla and Surjit Singh are contesting for the post of CKD secretary.
 
 Meanwhile, a group of CKD members have sent a complaint to Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh, blaming Chadha for allegedly violating the Akal Takht’s January 23 directions banning him from addressing any religious, social, political or academic functions.
 
 In the complaint, CKD members alleged that Chadha was openly canvassing in support of Santokh on WhatsApp. They had also sent a clip to the jathedar, alleging that Chadha had tried to field his daughter-in-law Inderjit Kaur, wife of his late son Inderjit Singh who had committed suicide, for the post of vice-president but couldn’t as she had not completed the mandatory five-year period as a CKD member before contesting for the post.
 
 The CKD members have urged the jathedar to take note of Chadha’s ‘political’ and ‘social’ activities and take religious action against him. Notably, the jathedar had also directed to keep an eye on the “character” of Charanjit for next two years.
