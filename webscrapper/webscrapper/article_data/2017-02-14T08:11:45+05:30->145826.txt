BENGALURU: Of the 476 airports and airstrips in the country, only 94 of are operational with 75 having scheduled flights. The rest are under-served. Not just that, only 2% of Indians travel by air.

 Making this revelations on Monday , G K Chaukiyal, executive director of the regional connectivity scheme (RCS) at   (AAI), said, “The government launched   to make flying affordable and trigger industry growth through fiscal support and infrastructural development. By involving state and central governments, it is seeing a boost. This scheme holds the key to inclusion as it will involve under-served airports.“
 
 “Only 2% of Indians travel by air. It's important to break the perception that air travel is only for the elite. A growing middle-class population of 30 crore with increasing income would benefit by this scheme,“ Chaukiyal said. On connectivity to remote areas, he said only smaller aircraft would connect those places initially.
 
 The third edition of the Bizavindia conference on Monday aimed at enhancing business through air connectivity. According to Chaukiyal, the RCS could help India reach its potential to be among the global top three in terms of air traffic, but has been suffering due to the low penetration of markets, even lower than Pakistan and Sri Lanka, among other factors.
 
 The conference, organized by the   (BAOA), was aimed at bringing various operators on to a common platfor m to discuss new changes to industry policies.BAOA president   said, “We feel like we are being heard. There are signs of vibrancy and growth which is excellent,“ he said.
 
 Group captain  , managing director of BAOA, said that last year's policy was the first comprehensive policy document on civil aviation. “Given India's need to innovate and develop, the business aviation sector is growing well,“ he said. Some industry members expressed their concerns over procedural delays and repeated changes of heads that were hampering the growth of the industry.
