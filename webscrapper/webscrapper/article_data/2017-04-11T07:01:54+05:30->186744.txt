KALYAN: After a crackdown on the   at Retibandar by the Thane collectorate, the   (KD-MC) and   have served demolition notices to over 150 illegal structures. Of those, 121 come under the maritime board and 36 tabelas under KDMC. 

 Most of these structures belong to the mafia, involved in sand mining over 1.5km. 
 
 KDMC disconnected water supply of these structures, while MSEDCL disconnected electricity.
 
 Bazarpeth police detained 10 persons when a protest was held outside KDMC headquarters on Monday. 
 
 Sources said Thane collector Dr Mahendra Kalyankar told the maritime board and KDMC to jointly demolish the structures so that entire area can be developed like a beach. KDMC, maritime board and revenue department officials dismantled seized equipment worth Rs 72 crore. 
 
 A portion of the area has been levelled using the seized sand. 
 
 During the dismantling of equipment, KDMC B ward officer   suffered a back injury when he fell. He is being treatment at   in Kalyan. 
 
 The action against the sand mafia by the collector has raised questions about local maritime board officials' responsibility to keep a watch on sand mining. A senior official from the Thane collector's office said, "Keeping a watch on illegal work like sand mining and illegal boats ferrying in the creek is the responsibility of maritime board officials. The way the mafia was operating at the entrance of Kalyan city shows they are hand-in-glove with them."
