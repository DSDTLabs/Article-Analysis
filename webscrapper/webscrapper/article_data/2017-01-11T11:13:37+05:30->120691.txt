PATNA: Police have preserved the viscera of Deki Kumari (15) for further investigations to ascertain the exact cause of her death and to know if she was   or not.

 The Class X dalit girl’s body was found lying in a pool of blood near the stairs of her hostel at Ambedkar Girls’ High School on Mahua road under the Sadar police station area in   district on Sunday.
 
 Police have arrested Mohd Qaiser and Sanju Devi, wardens of the hostel of the lone school for dalit girls where students from across Bihar study. The girl’s mother Kusmi Devi has lodged an FIR against the two wardens and school principal Indu Devi, whose involvement is under investigation.
 
 Vaishali SP Rakesh Kumar said police would not comment at the moment as the matter was sensitive. He said doctors who conducted postmortem did not find spermatozoa on the girl’s person. “Nor any injury mark caused by a weapon was found. The doctors have reserved their opinion on the cause of death,” he said.
 
 Police are waiting for forensic and other medical reports to establish the reason behind the mysterious death. 
 
 “I have asked the civil surgeon to provide further medical assistance on the issue of bleeding from the girl’s private parts. The civil surgeon, who was part of the medical board that conducted autopsy, has told us that it could be a result of injury from a sharp object. A wooden cot was also found at the spot,” the SP said.
 
 When asked, the SP virtually ruled out the possibility of death due to fall from a height as the body was lying near the hostel.
 
 He said a team has been sent to Muzaffarpur to record the statements of the girl’s two room-mates who left the premises immediately on Sunday morning. 
 
 Meanwhile, the principal has been suspended and a new incumbent posted at the school.
