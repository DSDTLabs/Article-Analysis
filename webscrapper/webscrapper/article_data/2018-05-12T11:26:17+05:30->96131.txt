JAIPUR: The dream of 11 men to go overseas and earn a decent life for their families back home in the Shekhawati region, has met with a dead end. 

 
 After paying a hefty sum of nearly Rs 1.5 lakh each to the agents who promised them lucrative job in private company in   in Saudi Arabia, these men who belong to Churu, Sikar and Jhunjhunu districts have not been given any job or money. Now, they are seeking an early return home and have sought intervention from government. 
 
 On Friday the labourers spoke to TOI over phone from Riyadh and urged for an intervention to take up their matter to the external affairs ministry, who can bring them back home. 
 
 “Jaldi se humko yahan se nikaaliyey hum bahut pareshan hain (We are suffering please hurry and bail us out of here),” said Mohammed Hassan.   is a native of Taien village of Jhunjhunu district of the state. 
 
 All these 11 persons through local agents had applied for various labour jobs and were sent to Riyadh almost 50 days ago. “After we reached we were not given any job. All our money has been exhausted and we are presently living in an abandoned building of a private hospital in Riyadh,” said Hassan. 
 
 All these labourers are of average age of 25 except Jaffar, a native of Ratan Nagar village of Churu who is 35. “I had dreamt of earning good to feed my wife, three children and father. As soon as we reached the local agent betrayed us. They are promising to give us job but that is not happening for the past 50 days since we landed here. We appeal to the government of India and Rajasthan to help us in getting out of here and ensure our safe return to our country,” Jaffar added. 
 
 The 11 persons included Israil, a native of Khandela village (Sikar), Imran of   (Churu), Rashid of Ladnun (Nagaur), Aamir of Sikar, Jaffar of Ratannagar (Churu), Shoeb of Jhunjhunu, Khurshid of Jamesar (Jhunjhunu), Abdul Raheem of Ramgarh Shekhawati (Sikar), Mohsin of Bisau (Jhunjhunu) and Hassan of Tain village (Jhunjhunu).
