Rajkot: Two persons were booked for forging documents of a house in Rajkot which is owned by a non-resident Gujarati (NRG) living in United Kingdom. According to Lodhika police, NRG Vasantrai Raychura (67), lodged a complaint against Bhusan Solanki and his accomplice Sanjay Gohil, both residents of Rajkot, for forging documents and illegally taking possession of his brother’s house in the city. Vasantrai’s brother Mukundrai Raychura, who died in 2013, owned a bungalow in the NRI Park on Kalawad Road. When Mukundrai was alive, Vasantrai used to stay in the house whenever he visited India. A few months ago, Mukundrai’s relative from UK visited Rajkot and saw that his house was being renovated. When he returned to UK, he inquired with Vasantrai whether they had sold Mukundrai’s house in Rajkot. Vasantrai on learning about the incident wrote a letter to Rajkot rural superintendent of police and urged him to take action. After investigation, police found that the accused had forged documents of the bungalow and took its possession.
