HYDERABAD:   in the city welcomed the Centre's move to have one single entrance test for engineering from academic year 2018-19 on the lines of the national eligibility and entrance test for medical colleges. The decision, managements say , will reduce the number of vacant seats that have increased in the past few years.

 Analysis of data provided by   reveals that between 2012 and 2015, there were 4,75,928 vacant engineering seats in Telangana alone.Experts say that this is because the number of students in the state is inversely proportional to the number of colle ges. Engineering seats in Telangana are now not open for students from other states.However, Centre's move to introduce single entrance test comes as a major relief to private unaided colleges.
 
 “We finally have a ray of hope as under the national entrance test, there are chances that we can fill the vacant seats by giving admission to students from other states. We had repeatedly urged the state government to allow enginee ring aspirants from other sta tes to appear for Eamcet, bu to no avail,“ said  , president of Telangana Private Engineering Colleges Association.
 
 Others are of the opinion that the burden on the students to appear in multiple entrance tests of various states will be reduced. “Currently, students appear in multiple entrance tests just to secure an engineering seat. Different states have different syllabi, making it difficult for students,“ said   , president of Telangana Affiliated Engineering Colleges Teachers Association. The test will, however, not include admission to IITs across the country .
