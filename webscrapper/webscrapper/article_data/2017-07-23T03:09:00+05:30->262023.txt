Panaji: The flying squad has issued a stop work notice against an illegal encroachment being carried out in lowlying flood plains of the River Mandovi, but citizens are worried about the continuation of the illegal activity clandestinely in phases. The notices had been issued in the past with regard to rampant mudfilling that covered massive areas of 5,500 sqm, while other parcels of cultivable land admeasuring nearly 600 sqm, 1,800 sqm and 900 sqm have been also reclaimed. The reclamation in property bearing survey No. 81/1 in the comunidade village, known as Morombi O Grande, has been carried out for some years and permanent structures have sprouted at the site. Further extension of the area through mud-filling evoked criticism and concern over the damage to the ecosensitive zone. ‘These are tenanted fields and the government should not allow any development in the area,” Jose Carmino Joao of Merces Manch Welfare Association said. Local activists have been complaining for some years about the illegal reclamation, raising apprehensions that extreme weather events may lead to floods in lowlying areas. “Just three to four days of rain flooded the Vaddy-Panaji road in lowlying areas in Merces,” Joao said. The haphazard reclamation to carve out more land for shanties and scrapyards has blocked the flow of rainwater from the fallow paddy fields to the Chimbel river. “The shanties also have illegal power connections, as law and order machinery has failed to initiate action,” Joao alleged. Villagers are planning to take up the issues at the gram sabha after the new panchayat body convenes a meeting.
