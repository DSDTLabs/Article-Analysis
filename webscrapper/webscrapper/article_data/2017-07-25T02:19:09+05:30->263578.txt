NEW DELHI: A   on the fourth floor of   near   on Monday afternoon. There were over 3,000 people inside the building, but they were evacuated within 15 minutes. While no one was injured, firemen had to break open windows and pull out six people who were still trapped inside.

 Delhi Fire Services said the fire started at 4pm and six fire tenders were rushed to the spot. When the blaze started spreading rapidly, another 20 fire tenders, including three heavy lift cranes, were sent in the next two hours. The fire was controlled by 6.30pm and cooling operations were on till late in the evening.
 
 Initial probe suggests that the fire broke out because of a short circuit in an air conditioning unit. Employees are being questioned to ascertain the exact cause. Another fire had broken out in the building two years ago.
 
 While the office of Income Tax Settlement Commission (ITSC) was gutted, property and documents were destroyed at the National Commission for Scheduled Castes office after the fire spread to parts of the fifth floor. The building also houses the office of Enforcement Directorate. A senior fire officer said they are trying to find out if the building had fire clearance.
 
 Renu, an employee at ITSC, called the fire department after noticing smoke coming from the window next to her seat. “One of the AC units on the parapet had caught fire. Sparks fell on piles of paper and files kept near the window due to which the fire spread rapidly. My colleagues and I tried to douse the fire using extinguishers, but failed to do so,” she said.
 
 When the fire alarm went off, employees thought it was a mock drill that is conducted every couple of months. “We soon started experiencing problems in breathing and noticed smoke rising from the fourth floor. We left behind our belongings and rushed downstairs,” said Mahesh, an Enforcement Directorate employee.
