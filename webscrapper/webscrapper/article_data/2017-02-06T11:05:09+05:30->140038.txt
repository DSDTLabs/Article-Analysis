RANCHI: The anti-terror squad ( ) of the state police on Sunday conducted a   of counter-insurgency-cum-VIP rescue operations at   in Hotwar, where the state’s first sponsored global investment summit is scheduled to take place on February 16 and 17.

 In a 30-minute long operation, two units of ATS commandos conducted and tackled a possible hostage situation in one of the eight under-construction hangars, which will serve as the VIP lounge-cum-media centre during the event. Sniffer dog squads belonging to the CID and 46 ATS commandos were also present during the drill.
 
 State ATS chief   said at least four ATS teams, each comprising 23 commandos, will be on stand-by during the summit. “ATS teams will be used for quick response and emergency situation only,” Dungdung said. 
 
 The summit, Momentum Jharkhand, is expected to witness a confluence of VIPs. Eight Union cabinet ministers, including finance minister Arun Jaitley, home minister Rajnath Singh, minister for industry and commerce Nirmala Sitharaman, are expected to attend the event. Ambassadors from 25 nations and heads of business conglomerates from India and other countries will also participate, besides the state’s cabinet ministry. 
 
 Keeping in view the high-profile delegation, the summit becomes a target for terror groups, Ranchi police claimed. 
 
 Although police refused to disclose the security details, sources said more than 4,000 policemen will be deployed around the sports complex, Birsa Munda airport and all routes leading to the summit venue. Two watch towers, overlooking the main entrance, will be manned by snipers while mobile police teams will keep a vigil on Harivansh Tana Bhagat Indoor stadium and Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo indoor stadiums.
