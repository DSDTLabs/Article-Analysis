Panaji: The Goa State Human Rights Commission on Wednesday called for reports from the chief secretary, director general of police and dean of Goa Medical College by April 3, in connection with the mortal remains of Fr   that have been lying at the GMC morgue for over 16 months.

 This came after the commission admitted a complaint filed by advocate Aires Rodrigues, stating that as forensic tests have been carried out and viscera reports received, the mortal remains are no longer required. Rodrigues requested the rights body to direct the chief secretary, DGP and dean of GMC to explain what steps they plan to take to ensure Dias’s body is laid to rest. 
 
 He said it is distressing that Dias’s body continues to remain at the regularly malfunctional morgue amid very unhygienic conditions, for no reason. “Fr Bismarque Dias’s rites cannot wait any longer. If nobody has claimed his body to hold the last rites, it would be a social responsibility to ensure his human rights are not further violated,” Rodrigues stated, citing the Supreme Court order in the Vikas Yadav v/s state of UP case where the SC had held that even in death a person has dignity and when one is dead, deserves to be treated with human dignity.
 
 “The state government,” Rodrigues’s complaint states, “cannot shy away from its duty in ensuring the disposal of the body and is duty bound to conduct the last rites according to the religious customs of the deceased or his last wishes, if any. Even the Goa Medical College has rules and standing instructions for disposal of a cadaver and such kind of disrespect cannot be tolerated a moment longer.”
 
 Dias, Rodrigues added, selflessly toiled for the state and must be laid to rest with all due respect to his departed soul.
 
 In his complaint to the Goa State Human Rights Commission, advocate Aires Rodrigues said Dias’ body continues to remain at the regularly malfunctional morgue at GMC for no reason
