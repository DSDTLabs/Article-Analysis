Chennai: For long, regional parties like the DMK in Tamil Nadu and TMC in West Bengal have been thinking of a coalition of regional parties to defeat the BJP at the Centre in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. With his visit to Chennai, where he held prolonged deliberations with the DMK on Sunday and Monday, Telangana chief minister and   president K Chandrasekhar Rao ( ) seems to have given some shape to the regional parties’ thoughts.

 Sources privy to KCR’s conversations said the Telangana CM’s mission is to oust the BJP, not to keep the   away from power. While talking to reporters KCR dismissed talks about a “third front,” and later in discussion with the DMK underscored the need for a “federal front” including the Congress.
 
 “For the meeting with  , KCR came armed with hard data. He expects the regional parties to win anywhere between 150 to 175 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and he is confident that just two parties – the DMK and the TMC – will account for 65 to 70 of those seats,” said a leader present at the meeting. On the other, the Congress expected to win about 100 seats. According to KCR, the Congress would get less than five seats in states where a strong regional party is opposing the BJP. While in other states where it is the principal opponent of the BJP, the Congress will gain more.
 
 “This, he says, paves the way for an inclusive government, not a government of the Congress supported by regional parties from outside,” said a DMK leader. KCR, he said, warned that a   against the BJP and the Congress would benefit the BJP. 
 
 “The talks are premature and would take several more rounds before we arrive at a consensus. Questions over who would lead such a government remain,” the source said.
