CHANDIGARH: A street corner near the Sector 42-C   is littered with garbage for a long time and no administrative attention has been paid to it. The spot is near some government flats.

 The entire stretch seem to be covered in  , with flies,  ,  ,   and pieces of sanitary ware spread all over. The spot’s turning into a makeshift parking space has further bothered many residents who live close by. The temple’s caretakers have lodged many complaints about this filth and foul odour around the shrine. “The day it rains, it is impossible to bear the stench,” said Kanhiaya, one of the brothers of the temple priest.
 
 The MC garbage truck makes rare visits to the corner. “The day it doesn’t come, it becomes difficult to venture out,” said Jatin, one of the nearby residents.
