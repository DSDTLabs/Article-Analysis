HYDERABAD: Over 1.09 lakh customers in Karwan, Vijayanagar Colony, Masab Tank, Humayun nagar, Mehdipatnam, Goshamahal, Jiyaguda, Mangalhat, Boggulakunta, Gowliguda, Sultan Bazar, Red Hills and New MLA Quarters have been getting water from Krishna instead of Singur for the past few days. 

 Till December third week, these areas used to get water from Singur. After a recent decision by the government to utilise Singur water for 'Mission Bhagiratha' in Medak district, the Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMWS&SB) has stopped Singur supplies to these areas. 
 
 When the Singur reservoir had dried up, the   used to   from Osmansagar (Gandipet) reservoir. Due to bountiful rains last year, the water board had started supplies from Singur instead of Osmansagar as it wanted to tap Gandipet water in summer for emergencies. 
 
 "For the first time, the water board had given   to these areas when the city's two drinking water sources Osmansagar and Himayatsagar dried up two years ago. After water levels in the Singur reservoir reached satisfactory levels, the water board restored Singur supplies from September, 2016. As Singur water was allotted for Mission Bhagiratha, the water board has compensated the areas with Krishna water," HMWS&SB deputy general manager (Osmansagar) G Ramakrishna told STOI. 
 
 For areas covered under Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Division-III (Karwan, Vijayanagar colony, Masab Tank, Humayun nagar, Mehdipatnam), the water board used to get Singur water from Khanapur reservoir and for remaining areas, which were under O&M Division-IV (Goshamahal, Jiyaguda, Mangalhat, Boggulakunta, Gowliguda, Sultan Bazar, Red Hills and New MLA Quarters) we used to supply from Asifnagar, Shaikpet and Red Hills reservoirs.
