After hitting the bullseye at the box office with the Aadi-starrer  , director   is all chuffed and fully confident about her next romantic drama Vaisakham. This one, however, comes with a 'dose of family sentiment' too. The director says, 'Love is a bond between all human relationships, not just the romantic kind. Love is also not two people looking at each other. It is two people looking at a future together. And   also reflects that sentiment.'
Her actor   too echoes, 'Love should not be restricted to this idea of romance between a boy and a girl. Love is all pervasive in life. You love your parents, friends, even pets. That's one of the things that the movie will tackle,' 
 Despite the higher motives, Jaya, however, is relying on the quintessential 'opposites attract' mantra to cook up the chemistry onscreen. 'Harish is a natural. He can do an extremely dramatic scene without going OTT. But he took time to get comfortable with the team.   (Mishra), on the other hand, is an outgoing person. When it comes to work, she is extremely dedicated.'
 Same is the case when it comes to the actors' definition of love. Avantika says, 'I'm very old school! I like the idea of the guy wooing the girl and making an effort.' Meanwhile, Harish quips, 'Girlfriend? I have girlfriends!'
