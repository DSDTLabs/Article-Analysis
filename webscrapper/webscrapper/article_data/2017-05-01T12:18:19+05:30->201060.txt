What if you were only given   to speak in a day? How would you use them? 50 Words, a play staged recently in Delhi, tried to put the wisdom back in words in a world where social media has hijacked all our space and the importance of words has been lost.

 
 
 Written by  , the play revolved around   – portrayed by   – a quirky chatterbox who refuses to regard the feelings of those around her. One day, God decides to teach her a lesson. He gives her just 50 words to speak for a day. Unaccustomed to this change, Zara struggles, but later, realises how being silent at times is helpful.

 Talking about his inspiration for the play, Shivjeet said, "I couldn’t speak for a month as I developed some problem due to stress. During that time, I couldn’t express myself completely and was unable to communicate my needs clearly. In that month, I realised how important words are. I took inspiration from my own struggle and wrote this play."

 Shibani Bedi, who is also seen on many web series, said, "I'm doing theatre since the age of 14, and I still get nervous every time I go up on stage. Shooting for a web series is very different from performing in front of a live audience. Here, it’s all in the moment as you can’t do retakes."
 Doing theatre after a long time, Shibani loved her character. "She's a rebel without a cause. She has all this goodness inside her, but she portrays herself as carefree because of the harsh, unforgiving world she lives in. After the experiment that God tries on her, she realises her self-worth," she said.
 Actor  , who was recently seen in Jolly LLB 2 in the role of the police commissioner, was also present at the event. He said, "The play was fun. The concept and storyline were very unique."
