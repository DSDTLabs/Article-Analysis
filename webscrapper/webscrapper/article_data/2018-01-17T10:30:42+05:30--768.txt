HYDERABAD: To mark late research scholar Rohith Vemula’s ‘Shahadath Din’, the Ambedkar Students’ Association (ASA) planned a slew of events, including a rally held on Tuesday. Dontha Prashanth, an ASA leader, said, “We took out a rally from ‘H’ hostel around 9pm on Tuesday, followed by several cultural programmes.”

 On Wednesday, Vemula’s second death anniversary, ASA expects many people to turn up to pay tribute to the Dalit scholar who committed suicide on campus. “At 4pm, we will take out a rally inside campus. Then, we will garland  's stupa (smarak) at the shopping complex near Velivada, following which speakers will address students,” said Prashanth.
 
 Varsity sources claimed permission had not been sought for Tuesday’s rally. They said apart from seven speakers, who had been granted permission to enter campus on Wednesday, a request for two other outsiders was forwarded on Tuesday, which was sanctioned. Sources said media would not be allowed on campus on Wednesday.
