NEW DELHI: In a first for any airline globally,   will reserve one row — six seats — in economy class for single women travellers on  . The airline will reserve the third row in economy section of its single aisle planes used for flying within the country.

 “From January 18, we will start reserving a row for single women flyers. Depending on how it goes, we will consider replicating the move on our international flights,” said the airline’s spokesman Anil Mehta.
 
 The first two rows in economy class are sold at a premium because of extra leg room. Due to this, AI has reserved the row immediately behind them for women.
 
 The airline’s move comes after a woman passenger on a Mumbai-Newark flight last month was reportedly molested by a person who left his business class seat to sit next to her in the economy section. After this case, AI decided to keep plastic restrainers for unruly passengers on all its flights.
 
 The move by AI is a first for airlines. All other modes of transport in India like trains, buses and metros have either seats or coaches reserved for women.
