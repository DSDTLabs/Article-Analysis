NEW DELHI: Politicians voted out of power relate to common man woes better than when they were in office and could have done something to resolve the nagging issues. 

 
 Senior   leader P   was on Sunday “horrified” to find that tea and coffee are prohibitively expensive at airports. 
 
 “At   Coffee Day I asked for tea. Offered hot water and tea bag, price Rs 135. Horrified, I declined. Was I right or wrong?” he said. In another tweet, he complained about coffee too. “Coffee Rs 180. I asked who buys it? Answer was ‘many’. Am I outdated?”
 
 Twitterati, however, did not take these comments too kindly and had a field day taking potshots at the lawyer-cum-politician. “Sir, you probably asked the price first time and declined to have it, but we are paying since more then 9-10 years, same price,” said a twitter user.
