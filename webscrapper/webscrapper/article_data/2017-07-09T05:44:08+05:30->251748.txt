AHMEDABAD: A special court has rejected request made by 10 persons, accused in the 2008 serial blasts case, to bring them back to   from Madhya Pradesh.

 The suspects, including Safdar Nagori, Kamruddin Nagori and  , were shifted to an MP prison after they were convicted in a terrorism case in May. The court had ordered their shifting on a request made by the jail authority on the ground that they were required to serve the life sentence in MP.
 
 The lawyers representing the accused urged the special court to bring the 10 accused back to Sabarmati jail mainly on the ground that though they can attend the proceedings through video-conferencing, their presence in Ahmedabad could be of great help for their lawyers in taking instructions during the trial. They also argued that since conviction has already been recorded in MP, there is no need to keep them in a jail in the neighbour state.
 
 It was also argued that since these accused persons were kept in Gujarat during the trial that was going on against them in MP, their case could not be put in strong manner. The lawyers feared the same in this case also.
 
 After hearing the case, special judge Ambalal Patel earlier this week rejected the application. Apart from these 10 accused out of total 77 persons who are being tried by the special court, there are accused who mark their presence during the proceedings through video-conferencing from the states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala since they are lodged in jails in respective states.
 
 Meanwhile, these 10 accused have also moved Gujarat high court taking exception to their shifting to an MP jail. They have questioned the trial courtâ€™s order by which they were shifted to MP jail. They have also cited an incident of encounter of terror suspects belonging to a certain community in MP that took place last year and expressed apprehension for their lives too.
 
 Fifty-six persons were killed in the city when 19 bomb blasts took place on July 26, 2008.
