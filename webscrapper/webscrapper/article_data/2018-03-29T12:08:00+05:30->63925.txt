JAIPUR: The Jodhpur police have begun a crackdown on those involved in taking out a procession on Ram Navami in which a tableaux was presented that glorified the Rajsamand hate-crime accused,  .

 City police commissioner Ashok Rathod told TOI that people identified would be booked under the relevant sections of the CrPC. “Action will be taken against those who took out the tableaux to ensure that peace and tranquility remains in the city,” he told TOI.
 
 Earlier on Tuesday, the state home minister   said in Kota that action would be taken against those involved in glorifying Raigar.
 
 The murder accused, currently in jail, was hailed as a crusader against “love jihad”. The incident came to light on Tuesday when photos of the procession, including the   on a tractor trolley, went viral on social media. The photos of the tableaux show a youth in a red kurta, white scarf around his neck, sitting cross-legged on a chair, holding a pickaxe, the weapon allegedly used by Raigar to hack to death migrant worker Afrazul in December 2017.
 
 Another tableaux picture shows a man, representing the victim Afrazul, lying at Raigar’s feet.
 
 The Jodhpur police are also verifying the videos and photos to identify the persons who had taken part in the tableaux. “Action has to be taken to ensure that such things do not take place again. There is no law that allows such glorification,” a top police official said.
