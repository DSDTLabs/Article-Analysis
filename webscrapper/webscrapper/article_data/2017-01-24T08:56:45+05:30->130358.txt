AJMER: The   (RBSE) will include ' ' & ' ' as chapters in   from next  

 Here, students will be taught about 'cashless system' and 'mobile wallet structure', said RBSE chairman B L Choudhary . If the theory of demonetisation is included then it should talk about merits and demerits of the process, feel experts. "It will not be good if it is lopsided. It has to be balanced and should discuss both merits and demerits of demonetisation," said an expert. Besides, the board is also bringing about changes in its functioning. To start with, swipe machines have been installed at Vidhyarati Sewa Kendra on the RBSE premises in Ajmer. 
 
 "With this, students will be able to obtain certified duplicate copies of their mark sheet and certificates from here by way of 'cashless system'," said Choudhary . Explaining it, he said students can make the payment for the same using debit or credit cards.
 
 The payment that is made to examiners is already cashless. "Now, the board will make every transaction online through RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement, which is an electronic form of funds transfer)," said Choudhary . Also, the board is planning to go online with examination formalities as per the directions of the state IT department.
