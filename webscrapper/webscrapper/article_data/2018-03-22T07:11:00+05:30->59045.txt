LUDHIANA: Delays in rehabilitation and removal of encroachments near   is further delaying reconstruction work of the bridge here. The municipal corporation of the city is yet to prepare a plan to rehabilitate the encroachers, and till then neither encroachments can be removed nor demolition of old part of bridge can be started.

 Earlier there was a plan to dismantle the old portion of the bridge from this week, but now work will start only when the encroachments will be rehabilitation completely.
 
 The civic body after conducting a survey of the area had sought record from the revenue department to check whether that land belongs to the municipal corporation (MC) or any other department. The revenue department has informed the   that land belongs to MC, Railway and even   ( ). The MC has now decided to demolish the illegal structures of its own but they will rope in officials from other two departments as well.
 
 For the rehabilitation of the encroachers, the officials are planning to shift them to dwelling units in Giaspura. For this they require permissions from MC general house, which is yet to be formed. The officials claimed that they will have to wait for at least 10-12 days for this.
 
 The MC commissioner,  , said that they were trying to rehabilitate the people so that there should be no hue and cry while demolition of the structures.
 
 “It will take a few days to fulfill the formalities,” he said.
 
 Notably, one side of this bridge was closed by the railways in July 2016. It was declared that the structure was unsafe for movement of traffic. After almost one year, the state government released funds for the project to MC, which were further transferred to the railways. The MC had paid Rs 24.30 crore to the railways in the month of July last year but still the work could not kick off.
