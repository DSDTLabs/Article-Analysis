Moms are the same across the board. Only a month back, I told you the story of a   unit living in fear of the mom of their megaserial’s lead, and now, another unit is left crying, ‘Meri maa’.

Not only does mommy dearest accompany her to the sets and sees no wrong in her daughter’s attitude, she makes sure that she repeats her daughter’s words to the team. So tired is the   house of the actress’ tantrums and her big talks about her actor boyfriend that it’s contemplating a replacement. Even when there’s no work, there’s always the mother.
