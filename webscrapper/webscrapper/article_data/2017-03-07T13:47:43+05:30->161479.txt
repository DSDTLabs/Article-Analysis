AMARAVATI: Taking a strong exception to banks levying heavy charges for deposits, chairperson of the chief ministers' committee on digitisation of economy and   CM N Chandrababu   said that he would take up the issue with the Centre and faulted the bankers for  .

 Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Naidu said that bankers should not have taken such a decision which goes against the very recommendations of the CMs' panel. “It is a highly objectionable and   step. I will speak with all the people connected with the issue,“ Naidu said. He cautioned that bankers would suffer if people stop visiting the banks. He wondered why should people pay additional tax or charges for depositing their monies. The chief ministers' panel had made a strong recommendation against levying penalties on deposits. “The banks' move will help hoarding of money by individuals,“ Naidu observed.
