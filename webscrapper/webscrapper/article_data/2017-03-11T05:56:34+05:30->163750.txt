CHENNAI: Any chances of   for the city seem to be slim, as   have said that there is little chance for rain in   prior to the monsoons.

 Chief meteorologist of Skymet Weather, Mahesh Palawat said a trough of low pressure area extending from Chattisgarh to south Tamil Nadu and through Rayalseema had brought isolated rainfall to the state over the past few days. While suburbs of   also witnessed mild rainfall over the week, they could expect a dry spell in the coming days. 
 
 March to May is the pre-monsoon season for Chennai which usually benefits from the June-September southwest monsoon rains.
 
 It is going to be warmer this year when compared to last summer. Despite the isolated rains, temperatures are expected to go up in the next 24-48 hours in the state causing dry   and humidity, said weather experts. 
 
 The weather will be at least 1 to 1.5 degrees Celsius higher across the board with the state seeing a dry spell until May. Chennai on an average sees only about 3.5mm rain during the time period of March to May. However, this year, it may be worse due to higher temperatures.
 
 The Met department officials also said that unless there are low pressure systems formed in coastal areas, no significant rain is possible and the weather is expected to be humid and sultry. However, between March 11 and March 14, parts of the state, particularly coastal areas, may see isolated showers due to the onset of summer, they said.
