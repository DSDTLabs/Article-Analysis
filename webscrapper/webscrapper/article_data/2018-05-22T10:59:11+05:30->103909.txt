LUDHIANA: A woman brutally killed her husband with an iron rod in New Rajguru Nagar in the wee hours of Monday. Nanakki attacked Surinder Kumar on his head and face several times till he died. Rest of the family members were sleeping in the veranda when Nanakki tried to escape from there after the murder.

 However, some neighbours saw her leaving and brought her back. The family then found Surinder dead.
 
 Surinder, 35, a native of Uttar Pradesh, worked as a labourer. On the statement of his father, Shiv Lal, the Sarabha Nagar police have registered a case under Section of 302 (murder) of the IPC against Nanakki, 30, who also worked at construction sites like her husband.
 
 The couple was married for 13 years and had three children, two boys and a girl.
 
 Surinder was a drunkard and would often beat up his wife in an inebriated condition. This strained their relation.
 
 Shiv Lal said, “We have a oneroom house, so my wife, grandchildren and I sleep in the open. Surinder and his wife slept in the bedroom. Around 2.30am, three people came to our house with Nanakki and said they smelled a rat on seeing her running alone. I thought Surinder must have fought with her and she left the house. But Nanakki started crying and sought apology. I went inside the room to question Surinder and found him in a pool of blood. He had injuries on his head and face.”
 
 The family informed the police in the morning after which the body was sent to the civil hospital for a post-mortem examination and the woman arrested.
 
 Sarabha Nagar police station SHO inspector Brij Mohan said, “Nanakki has confessed to the crime and stated that Surinder would often beat her up in an inebriated condition. On Sunday night, too, he started thrashing her without any reason while the family was sleeping outside. In retaliation, she attacked him repeatedly with an iron road.”
