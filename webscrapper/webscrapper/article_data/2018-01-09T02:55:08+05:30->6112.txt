MUMBAI: The teacher fraternity across the state was in frenzy on Monday morning following a news article which quoted   saying that the state planned to shut down 80,000 schools. While   claimed that it was a conclusion that the journalist had drawn from a related statement, teachers groups said the state was making policies which reflected an intention to shut down government schools.

 At an event in  , a video of which is being circulated on messaging applications, Nandkumar said that if there were 1,000 students in each school, the state would need 30,000 schools as opposed to the current 1.1 lakh schools. 
 
 “I was just explaining the calculation of the number of school required for the students in the state. There was no intention to say that the state is shutting down 80,000 schools,” he said.
 
 Following the uproar among teachers, school education minister   took to Twitter. “Rumoured news about closure of 80,000 schools is false. Principal Secretary has not expressed any such thought. We as Government have no plan of closing 80,000 schools. Please do not believe such news & rumours as it is a political strategy to defame the good work of Edu Dept,” he said.
 
 Several teachers groups wrote to Tawde for clarification. Shikshak Bharati, a teachers’ organization, also staged a protest at the office of the deputy director of education’s office in Charni Road and demanded Nandkumar be removed from his post.
 
 Discussions among teachers said irrespective from the secretary’s statement, the school education department was taking steps which made the comment believable. “There is worry among teachers on what would happen to their jobs if the state continues to merge schools or shut them down on grounds of poor quality. The state is also promoting private companies to open more schools too,” said Uday Nare, teacher, Hansraj Morarji Public School, Andheri.
