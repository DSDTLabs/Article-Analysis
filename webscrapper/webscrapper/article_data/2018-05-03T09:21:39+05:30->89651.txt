CHENNAI: Airports Authority of India ( ) may be gearing up to set up new retail shops, including those that will sell packaged food, but these shops will not be allowed to bottled water, at Chennai airport. This will mean that shops at the airport will continue to sell bottled   at an expensive rate as there will be little competition. A bottle of water is sold at Rs 50 at Chennai airport. 

 Sources said firms interested in bidding for retail business raised a query about sale of water but AAI said that could not be sold. This means that bottled water will remain expensive and will be sold only by the existing food and beverages outlets offering little competition in pricing. An official said the retail contract says that outlets could be installed to sell packaged food but it was unfair to bar them from selling bottled water because the contract is already with F&B. 
 
 AAI has set up drinking water fountains but those who prefer bottled water have to shell out Rs40 or more inside the terminals. 
 
  (APAI) national president D Sudhakara Reddy said: "We have been getting complaints regarding pricing of water at the airport. It is expensive in private airports also. AAI should ensure that passengers have multiple options. The authorities should set up stalls where water will be sold at the price in which it is being sold in the city."
 
 He also said that the company appointed to set up food and beverages units had a monopoly. "Passengers should be given a choice," he added. 
 
 The packaged food and beverages come with the special price stamped on it with a label that they are specially priced for airport. A senior official said AAI was attempting to provide bottled water at cheaper rates inside the terminal. However, stalls planned for selling the bottled water at normal rates are not located at prominent locations. 
 
 A contract will be awarded to the highest bidder to attract big brands in retail to set up shop at the airport.
