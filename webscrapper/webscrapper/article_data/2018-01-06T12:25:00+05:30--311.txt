GAYA: Buddhist spiritual leader Dalai   began his three-day sermon delivery at Kalchakra Maidan in   on Friday morning. Thousands of followers have assembled in Bodh Gaya to hear the sermons called teachings. Live transmission of sermons in different languages is available on FM radio stations.

 On Friday, the spiritual leader dwelt at length with the essence of Buddhist belief system including the four noble truths of suffering, cause of suffering, cessation and the way out.
 
 The spiritual leader, while emphasising on the essential unity of human beings, irrespective of colour, region and belief system etc identified ignorance as the main cause of suffering. Once ignorance is replaced by wisdom, all sufferings come to an end. This essential unity is discernible in many respects including the body, mind and emotion.
 
 Emphasising the need for spiritual growth, the Buddhist leader said that material development cannot bring peace and many a time blind materialism add to our spiritual woes. “Contentment was something that is acquired through soul search, meditation and detached vision,” said the spiritual leader.
