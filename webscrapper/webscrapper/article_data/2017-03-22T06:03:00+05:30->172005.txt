NAGPUR: There are three source-based questions which hold a lot of importance. You need to concentrate on that. Then there are the 8-mark questions. You need to stick to the word limit.

 Students often tend to write either too short or too long. It makes it tedious for the examiner.
 
 Language is not very important here, so you don’t need to use ornamental words. Just make sure that all the valid points are present. For the 4-mark questions, write answers in the form of points, while for the 8-mark ones, write in paragraphs.
 
 History is a very exhaustive paper. Try to make sure that it becomes easy for the examiner to correct. Students often neglect maps. Maps can fetch you a lot of marks provided you study well.
 
 There are three books for history. From the first book, you need to be thorough with the third chapter pertaining to Mahabharata. The second chapter, political history, is also a must-read.
 
 From the second book, you should be well versed with the chapter of Sufi and Bhakti movement, partition and framing of the Constitution. These are the most important chapters. Also, you should be able to answer any question related to Buddhism.
 
 Do not get nervous. Write as much as you know. Don’t get confused after seeing the marks allotted to a question. Whether it is a 2-mark, 4-mark or 8-mark question, write everything you know about it.
 
 Value-based questions play an important role. Do not take these lightly. You don’t need to follow any particular order for the sections. Go for the section you know very well first.
 
 Be very cool before and during the paper. The more you stress, the more you will forget. To retain maximum matter, you need to be calm. Meditate on the morning of exam or do the thing which makes you feel the most at ease.
