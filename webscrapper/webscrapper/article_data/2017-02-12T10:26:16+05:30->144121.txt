NAGPUR: In contravention of its own rules, the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has permitted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to open its civic election campaign office in Buty Mall which is still under construction and thus has not been given an occupancy certificate. The party office is located on the ground floor and construction activities are going exactly above it.

 The Buty Mall, also known as  , is being developed by Pune-based Goel Ganga Infrastructure and Real Estate Private Ltd on Abhyankar Road in Sitabuldi. The Mall’s construction is at an half-completed stage.
 
 The entrance to the   is from Abhyankar Road. Since there is no provision for parking, vehicle are parked on the road connecting   with Munje Square.
 
 Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) officials said the mall has not been given occupancy certificate as of now. The NMC’s fire and emergency services department is also yet to give compliance certificate that is mandatory for issuing the occupancy certificate.
 
 As per the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, possession of any structure cannot be given before issuance of the occupancy certificate.
 
 Anup Khandelwal, the vice-president of Goel Ganga, told TOI that an application seeking occupancy certificate has been submitted to the NIT. “The space was sought by BJP leaders,” he added.
 
 BJP’s West Nagpur MLA   said the party has approvals from NMC and police department. “This is just a casual office as most candidates have opened their own offices at convenient spots. Therefore, there is not threat to people,” he said.
 
 An NMC official from Dharampeth Zone said the party had permission from it to open the office. “We are not aware of the occupancy certificate. An inspection will be held and action taken if needed,” he said.
