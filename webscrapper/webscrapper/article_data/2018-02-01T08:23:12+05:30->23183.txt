CHANDIGARH: The   administration will not get much from the central government in the   for the next financial year. The fund allocation will be announced by the Union finance minister in the general budget on Thursday. According to sources, against a demand of Rs 5,908 crore to carry out various developments works for the fiscal year-2018-19, the administration would get only around Rs 4,511 crore, just around 5% more than the funds allocated to the city for the ongoing financial year.

 The administration was allocated Rs 4,312 during the last budget. Sources said out of the total amount, around Rs 2,000 crore will be provided for salaries and wages of employees. The funds allocated would also include expenses pertaining to grant-in-aid to the Chandigarh municipal corporation.
 
 The other key areas include power, health, education, urban development and transport. For purchase of power, the UT will likely get around Rs 800 crore.
 
 After facing criticism for under-utilisation of funds in the past, the administration in the current financial year managed to use the funds in time. According to norms, a minimum of 25% is to be spent in each quarter. In the financial year of 2015-16, the administration had failed to utilise funds in time, as a result of which the centre imposed a cut in the budget allocated in the financial year of 2016-17.
 
 
 
 
 In the recent years, Chandigarh has been the highest revenue — both tax and non-tax — generating Union Territory without a legislature. Amongst all the five UTs — Chandigarh, Andaman and Nicobar Island, Dadra and Nagar Haveli,   and Diu and Lakshadweep — without legislatures, Chandigarh has generated highest revenue of around Rs 5,500 crore this financial year. According to sources, the UT administration has committed to the finance ministry for generating more revenue in the next financial year. Revenue generated by administration is not used in city as the administration draws and deposits money in the Consolidated Fund of India.
