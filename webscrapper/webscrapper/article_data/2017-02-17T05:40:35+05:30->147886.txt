THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Save   (State Bank of Travancore) Forum chairman and CPI national executive member   has demanded a review of the Union cabinet approval for   of   (SBI) and five subsidiaries, including SBT.

 Addressing a demonstration organized by the Save SBT Forum in front of the SBT headquarters here on Thursday, Raveendran said merging SBT, “which plays an important role in state’s developmental activities”, with SBI would adversely affect the loan disbursement in various sectors, including agriculture, industries, education and other service sectors.
 
 “Once the SBI is transformed into a global bank, its services will be focussed on catering to the needs of big corporates. It will also lead to closure of several branches of the SBT and job cuts,” he pointed out.
 
 Citing opposition from state government, the legislative assembly, members of Parliament, various political parties, bank account holders, shareholders, traders, industrialists and the general public against the merger, the CPI leader also said ignoring their sentiments was “undemocratic and against the spirit of federalism”.
