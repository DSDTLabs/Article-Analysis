The treasury benches thumped their tables in the state assembly on Saturday when Congress legislator Shrawan Kumar praised Uttar Pradesh chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi for swiftly getting down to delivering justice to the common man after assuming office. Kumar, who represents Surajgarh constituency in Jhunjhunu district, had moved an adjournment motion objecting to the reduction in pre-PG quota for doctors serving in rural areas. To emphasise that BJP government ministers should stop blaming the previous Congress government for every wrong practice existing in the state, Kumar gave example of the newly appointed Uttar Pradesh chief minister. “In UP, as soon as ‘Babaji’ (Yogi) became our chief minister, he began delivering justice, without bothering for any (political) party or anything. When people told him that he would be removed, he replied what did he have (to lose)?” Kumar said. Advising the BJP government to begin performing, Kumar said, “We were reduced to 21 (seats won by Congress in 2013 assembly elections). Now, do you want to be reduced to seven (in 2018 elections)?” Pleased at the Congress legislator’s remark, parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Rathore addressed the speaker and said, “Sir, there is a change of heart; a senior Congress MLA is all praise for our UP CM. This is indicative.” Kumar stuck to his remark and said, “Everyone who speaks in the House does not tell a lie. Truth cannot be hidden.”
