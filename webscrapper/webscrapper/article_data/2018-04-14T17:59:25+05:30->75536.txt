It took a 12-year old school kid to point out the glaring spelling errors in signboards put up across the city at prominent places in Lucknow, for the concerned authorities and departments to come into action and correct the spelling in a few of them. SM  , a student of class VIII at La Martiniere College, wrote a letter to UP CM   to intervene in the matter and get the spellings corrected in the signboards put up across the city by the   and the   (PWD). In his letter to the CM, Ayaan wrote that the boards, especially near the monuments, gave a bad impression of the city to foreign tourists who visited the city and also confused school kids like him, as to what was the correct name of the place, building or monument. To stress his point, in his letter, Ayaan included pictures of many such signboards which had spelling errors, including one at Kaiserbagh where the area was spelled as  , another one in which Gandhi was spelt was Ghandhi, one that had faculty spelt as fancnlty, Residency as   and Butler as Butlr, among many others.
"Every time I used to to see a spelling error on these signboards, I used to wonder what’s wrong with the people who are writing the spellings on these boards. I would also wonder what image will the foreign tourists coming to the city take back of our city, especially after I saw a signboard with a spelling mistake in the name George outside the King George’s  . I also enclosed several photographs of such signboards with the letter," says Ayaan, adding, “I then asked my dad to help me out in this matter, who then suggested me to write a letter to the CM. I wrote the letter on April 7, last week and thankfully action was taken by the CM and the spellings of monuments and places at boards several places have been corrected."
 And this isn’t the first time that Ayaan has been concerned about such issues with the city. "Two years back, when I saw a manhole without a cover, I wrote a letter to the DM, citing safety concerns of the commuters. Within a day, the manhole was covered. I think all of us should make such small efforts to contribute our bit to the society," shares Ayaan, who aims to become a politician. "I want to join politics and become one such example whom people can idolise. As of now, I think, there are hardly any politicians who can be idolised by the present generation. I want to become the Prime Minister one day," he stresses as he signed off with a promise to continue with many more such initiatives.
