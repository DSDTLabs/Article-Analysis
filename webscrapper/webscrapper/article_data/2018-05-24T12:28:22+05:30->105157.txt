CHANDRAPUR: The district and sessions court on Wednesday awarded   to a 33-year-old man held guilty for murdering his mother two years ago.

  Hemant Kulkarni had murdered his mother Anjali by cutting veins of her wrist and later slicing her throat on April 20, 2016. The convict and the victim lived together with their family at   here. Kaustubh had a mobile shop and was burdened with loans to the tune of Rs20 lakh.
 
 He was insisting on selling their house to settle the dues, but his mother was firmly against it. On the fateful day, Kaustubh had a quarrel with his mother when they were alone in the house. He murdered her and then sent an SMS to his wife and brother in-law telling about his act and his plans to commit suicide by jumping before a train.
 
 However, he did not commit suicide and fled to Nagpur, from where he was later arrested by the Ram Nagar police. An offence under sections 302 and 201 of IPC was registered against him.
 
 PI   filed a charge sheet with the sessions court with concrete evidences gathered by the cyber cell. Although all witnesses (relatives of accused) turned hostile, the prosecution presented a strong case based on technical evidences. Ad-hoc district judge-III and assistant sessions judge A Z Khan held Kaustubh guilty and awarded him death penalty.
 
 He was also sentenced to five-year jail term under section 201 of IPC and slapped with fine of Rs1,000. Government pleader advocate   appeared for the government before the court.
