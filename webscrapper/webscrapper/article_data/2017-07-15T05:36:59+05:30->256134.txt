Mumbai: The investigation in the   Manjula Shetye's murder case has taken a twist with  'claiming to have seen prison staffers remove evidence and clean up the crime spot with the help of some male inmates. 

 Nitin Satpute, lawyer of the MLA lodged in   jail in an alleged Rs 365-crore scam, told a court he wanted to give a confessional statement before the magistrate. The court questioned Satpute on the absence of Kadam’s signature on the vakalatnama. Satpute said he would comply with the procedures. 
 
 “Kadam said that a day after Shetye’s murder, he saw two constables taking out four convicts from barracks and removing all evidence from the crime scene. They also removed the sticks inserted in Shetye’s private parts and dumped them in a garbage bin,’’ Satpute said. 
 
 The postmortem report, however, has ruled out any such assault. Jail officials said there’s a demarcation between barracks so it was not possible for Kadam to have seen what was happening in the women’s barracks.
 
 Satpute also said  , an inmate and complainant in the murder case, has made an application seeking scientific test like brain mapping of jail staff and witnesses to find out the truth.
