MOHALI: Cremation ceremonies at Mohali cremation ground could stop as the Municipal Corporation (MC) here is left with fuel   stock that could only last for one week. The MC said that it had cleared this agenda over two months ago, but was still waiting for a nod from Punjab local bodies department.

 Earlier, Mohali   Kulwant Singh had written to the local bodies department to warn about the same. In his letter, Mayor stated that all the agenda points, which were cleared during an MC house meeting have been laying pending with local bodies department, Punjab.
 
 “We have been pressing them to clear the agendas as many developmental works have suffered because of the delay. If agenda like fuel wood for cremation ground is not cleared on time, then hope for timely clearance of other agendas is meager,” Kulwant said.
 
  “As per the MC Act, the objection on the agenda is to be raised within 21 days after the agenda is sent for approval. But here objection is raised after two months. The tender for the supply of fuel wood has been issued to Dashmesh Cooperative at Rs 31.64 lakh,” said MC commissioner Sandeep Hans.
 
 When contacted director local bodies Karunesh Sharma said, “We are already in the process of clearing the agendas. We are here to clear agendas of all the MCs across the state. As far as fuel wood agenda is concerned, we have sought comments of chief engineer IT.”
 
 “The local bodies in a statement to MC Mohali on January 11 said that this agenda had already been sent to chief engineer (IT), and since then there has been no response from the department said Mayor Kulwant Singh.
 
 “It is unfortunate that local bodies department is not safeguarding the interest of the residents. Of all the agendas, clearing fuel wood agenda for cremation ground must have been kept on priority but department seems to give it a political turn,” said Mohali deputy mayor Manjit Singh Sethi.
