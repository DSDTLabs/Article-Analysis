CHENNAI: In parts of Chennai where   supply is limited and packaged water unaffordable, residents are turning to the unorganised sector to meet their daily drinking needs. At least 25 units selling water have mushroomed in the neighbourhoods of   over the last decade, offering a 20-litre pot of untreated groundwater for a mere 10. 

 At Shankar Water, a 10*10 feet unit in Mannady, residents begin queuing up early in the morning with 20-litre plastic pots. For a 14,000-litre load of water, private tankers charge about 2,000. Water selling units on Mint Street,   and Mannady source water from private suppliers who bring them groundwater pumped from wells near  . "We have two 7,000-litre tanks set up at two different units. Water lorries fill these tanks every morning," Shankar of   said. 
 
 It's a win-win situation. Vendors make a handsome profit and customers are only too happy with the price. Sale of water in the unorganised sector, according to Broadway residents, has picked up over the last five years in the area and in surrounding neighbourhoods where groundwater has turned salty. However, not all residents use this water for drinking. Sankar Thambu   resident and homemaker R Parimalam said, "We only use water from these neighbourhood units for cooking and other non-drinking purposes. For drinking, we buy packaged water which is priced at 30 per 20-litres." 
 
 Shankar admits that there is no water treatment mechanism at his unit. "We only have a mesh filter at the bottom of the water tank to remove sand particles. Water at our unit tastes better than that the one supplied by Metrowater, which smells of chlorine," he said.
 
 Water vendors who have set up shop near   sell a 1-litre bottle of untreated groundwater water for 3. Vendors also offer boiled water for 5 per litre to those visiting the genreal hospital nearby. Similar shops have come up outside Government Hospital for Women and Children, Egmore.
