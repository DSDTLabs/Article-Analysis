CHENNAI: A day after a group of   organisers called upon health minister C Vijayabaskar to take steps to facilitate Pudukkottai district’s entry into the record books for conducting the highest number of jallikattu events, an animal rights NGO released footage revealing cruelty to bulls at two reckla (bullock cart racing) events held in   in 2018.

 
 The footage, released by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PeTA) India, showed bulls being given electric shocks, roughly pulled by their nose ropes, beaten and jabbed with pointed wooden sticks and their tails being bitten and yanked to make them run faster.   claimed that the footage were shot during the reckla events held at Kolumakondan in Dindigul district on January 21 and S   in Coimbatore district on February 4 respectively.
 
 “Despite a clear court ruling and the Tamil Nadu government’s clarification that bullock cart races are illegal, racers in Tamil Nadu gives bullocks electric shocks, bite their tails and beat them mercilessly in order to force them to run fast on hot tar roads,” said Nikunj Sharma, public policy lead of PETA. “PETA India is calling on authorities to ban all cruel events involving bulls as well as all forms of jallikattu,” he said.
 
 Through an   response, the government of Tamil Nadu made clear that the Tamil Nadu Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Conduct of Jallikattu) Rules, 2017, framed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017, prohibits rekla races in the state, said Sharma. “But illegal races are openly organised in Tamil Nadu. A recent one held on May 14 in   (  district) was flagged off by a deputy superintendent of police,” he said.
