NEW DELHI: Congress is mulling the name of former   Speaker   for   election in  .

 A proposal to field the Dalit leader, who contested the recent Presidential election as the joint candidate of the opposition, came up for discussion at a meeting called by Rahul Gandhi on Monday to clinch the ticklish issue of Congress nomination from the state.
 
 The party is keen on backing CPM chief Sitaram Yechury for a third term in the upper House. However, his fate is uncertain as the Left outfit seems unwilling to provide its general secretary a third innings.
 
 The Congress estimate is that the CPM central committee may veto any proposal to retain Yechury in the RS with the support of Congress.
 
 If Yechury is not present in the contest, it was proposed that Congress and CPM could find a common ground around a candidate of national stature they have jointly supported in the past.
 
 A senior leader is learnt to have suggested that Congress take a leaf out of the President’s election and field   Kumar. Since Congress and Left joined hands over Kumar as recently as last week, the CPM was unlikely to have any reservations.
 
 The proposal was made in the presence of AICC general secretary CP Joshi and Bengal leaders. The other names under consideration include Pradeep Bhattarcharya whose term ends in August. AICC is likely to take a decision after the CPM central committee meeting.
 
 Interestingly, Bengal Congress has expressed unanimous support for Yechury, which speaks as much about the CPM leader’s bonding with Rahul Gandhi as for the animosity that state Congress harbours against the ruling Trinamool Congress.
 
 TMC’s decision to nominate Congress rebel MLA Manash Bhunia for RS polls has stoked the anger further.
 
 The hostility in Bengal Congress against chief minister Mamata Banerjee is in stark contrast to the bonding between Congress and TMC at the Centre in their fight against BJP.
