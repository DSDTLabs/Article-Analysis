JAIPUR: Rajasthan government has approached the Centre with a proposal for setting up two   (ICDs) in Bhiwadi and Sirohi besides a   at   for showcasing export products.

 State industry minister  , who met Union commerce and industry minister   on Thursday, discussed about the viability and prospects of these projects which will help the marble industry in Udaipur and the exporters of Bhiwadi.
 
 Currently, exporters from Udaipur use the inland ports available in Ahmedabad for exporting while the industry in Bhiwadi routes its goods through an inland depot at Khatuwas in Haryana. The proposed Sirohi port will help in moving the consignments from Udaipur.
 
 A senior government official said the Centre is expected to do a viability study of these two ICDs factoring in the volume of goods after which a concrete plan can be developed for the implementation of the projects.
 
 Shekhawat urged the Centre to encourage a state-specific and sector-oriented strategy instead of ‘one size fits all’ policy for increasing exports and give subsidy to exporters to bear the transportation cost to the ports.
 
 He said that research labs and certification bodies should be increased for agriculture, handicraft and textiles products that are exported from Rajasthan in large numbers.
