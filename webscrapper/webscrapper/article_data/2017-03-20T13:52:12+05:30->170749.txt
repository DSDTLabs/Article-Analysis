PATNA: The state government has removed Saran DM   and kept him waiting for posting.  , a 2006 batch IAS official and midday meal director will replace Anand. IRS officer Vikas, who is additional secretary in the education department, will hold the additional charge of midday meal director, a notification issued by the general administration department said on Sunday. 

 Anand’s removal was expected after the team probing the January 14 boat tragedy this year submitted its report, which blamed the officials of tourism department and Patna and Saran districts administration for the lack of arrangements to bring back people from the Sabbalpur diara area after the kite festival on Makar Sankranti day, leading to overcrowding of a country boat which capsized in the Ganga resulting in the loss of 24 lives. 
 
 CM Nitish Kumar had constituted the probe committee comprising energy department principal secretary   and DIG (central range) Shalin.
 
 “As model code of conduct was in force due to council election, the decision regarding Anand’s removal was not implemented,” a senior GAD official said. After the probe committee submitted its report, the state government had suspended Sonepur SDPO Mohammad Ali Ansari and asked Saran SP Pankaj Kumar Raj to report to the police headquarters. The government had also asked the then city (Patna) magistrate Manzoor Alam and magistrate (law and order)   to wait for posting. 
 
 The government had also transferred tourism department principal secretary Harjot Kaur to the mines and geology department and Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation MD   to the animal husbandry and fisheries resources department as joint secretary after the probe report.
