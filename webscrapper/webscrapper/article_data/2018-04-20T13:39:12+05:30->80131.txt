BETTIAH: Police detained a 30-year-old man after his teenage daughter hanged herself to death at a village under Majhaulia police station area in Bihar’s West Champaran district on Thursday.

 West Champaran SP Jayant Kant said police were investigating the allegations of the 13-year-old girl’s sexual exploitation by her father.
 
 “As of now, such an accusation hasn’t been made. The deceased’s mother is in the process of lodging an FIR. Initial investigations revealed certain villagers had seen the man in an inappropriate condition with his daughter. We shall wait for the postmortem report,” he said.
 
 Reports quoting the husband of the village sarpanch said the girl and her mother had convened a ‘panchayati’ of village elders a week ago on the matter (of sexual exploitation). “The meeting had rebuked the girl’s father and the matter was also verbally communicated to the local police station,” the sarpanch’s husband told local reporters.
 
 Apparently in a disturbed state, the girl ran away from village on Wednesday and was brought back home by family members. Early Thursday morning, she was found hanging.
