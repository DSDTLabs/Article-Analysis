LUDHIANA: Putting up a last-ditch effort in generating revenue through the sale of their old  , civic officials have now started approaching individual  , so that they avail of the policy, and become owners of these properties. The policy will end on March 31, but in the initial months, nobody has reached the   for the same, therefore now they are approaching individuals. 

 The local bodies department had issued a notification in this regard in November 2017 with an idea to recover old pending dues from tenants who are neither leaving the rental  , nor letting the rent increase. Some of the tenants are not even paying the rent amount, despite the fact that MC had fixed a nominal rent for these properties. The tenants still have time to pay up until March 31.
 
 The tenants will have to pay 25% of the collector rate of the area. One fourth payment will have to be given within one month, and the rest will be payable in three annual instalments. In case the applicant pays the entire amount within 30 days, then an additional 5% rebate will be given. However, officials claimed they had visited each market at least thrice, but it was getting difficult to convince the tenants. It had come to light that some of them had further given shops to other people on rent, so it was getting tough to trace the actual tenants in such cases.
 
 The MC had a total of 631 rental properties in the entire city. Out of these, most properties are over 20 years old. Civic officials have to recover around Rs 4.5 crore from these tenants in the form of rent, but in case tenants purchase the shops, then there would be more benefit for MC, because the shops are located in a prime location. Joint commissioner   said they had asked officials concerned to issue individual letters to tenants, and also give them a call, so that they could come and take propriety rights over the properties.
