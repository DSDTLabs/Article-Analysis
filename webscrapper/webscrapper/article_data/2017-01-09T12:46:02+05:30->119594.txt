THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Thiruvananthapuram   (MHC) will open a Sangeetha Aaramam (  of Music) for the inmates on Wednesday, in a bid to use the soothing power of music to treat psychiatric disorders.

 The music rehab project, which uses music therapy for mood enhancement and anxiety or stress relief, is a joint initiative of the social service forum of Nanthencode Jerusalem Marthoma Church and Swaranjali, a city-based organization.
 
 The project was jointly inaugurated by Palayam Imam VP Suhaib Moulavi and Jerusalem Marthoma Church Vicar   by planting a sapling at the newly landscaped garden at the Vidyakendra female rehabilitation unit at the MHC. 
 
 Moulavi said that a garden with birds, flowers and butterflies will be a better place than a conference hall to bring the inmates into the world of music. “ We should believe in the miracles music can do and support this initiative wholeheartedly,” he said.
 
 MHC superintendent Dr Jayashree said, “Music can play a major role in allaying anxiety and stress of the inmates. They will feel that they are in a secure and accepting environment, where positive changes can take place”.
 
 Swaranjali convener Johnson Idayaranmula said that the therapy for the inmates will be held every week and once in a month special programmes will be organized.
