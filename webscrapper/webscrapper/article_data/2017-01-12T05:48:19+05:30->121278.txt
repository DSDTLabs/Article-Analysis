PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Pimpri camp will get its own  , for which a plot has already been identified at Bhatnagar.

 Pimpri camp has witnessed quite a number of   for which the fire engines were brought in from Sant Tukaramnagar, four kilometers away.
 
 It is the largest market for clothes, electrical and electronic goods and groceries among other items in Pimpri Chinchwad city. The major internal roads have been widened but there is traffic congestion due to parking of vehicles on both sides. Some lanes are too narrow for even a three-wheeler to pass.
 
 The proposed fire station at Bhatnagar would also serve a large number of residents living in housing societies along the Pimpri Chinchwad Link Road.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Uday Wankhede, sub-officer with additional charge of fire officer,   said, “The planned fire station site is a prime location due to its proximity to the Pimpri market. The fire engines take longer to reach from Sant Tukaramnagar as they have to get through congestion on various roads and the overbridge. We will station two engines near Bhatnagar which would cater to the fires occurring in Pimpri camp, Pimprigaon, Kalewadi and slums around Pimpri camp.”
 
 Dabbu Aswani, standing committee chairman, PCMC said, “A short-notice resolution has been approved by the standing committee to start a fire station in Pimpri on a 5,000 sq.ft. plot near Pimpri crematorium at Bhatnagar.”
