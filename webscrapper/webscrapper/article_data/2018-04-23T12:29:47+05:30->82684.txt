HYDERABAD: Though the   ( ) collected call data records (CDR) of several persons, including those arrested in the case and critical witnesses, with no certification from the concerned authority, the evidence became useless. 

 The printouts of CDRs pertaining to various telephone numbers were declared during investigation by the CBI, which was the first investigation agency in the   blast case, during trial. However, it was found that these documents were signed by the investigation officer himself and they were not certified by any competent authority like service provider. It was on these mobile phone devices and various SIM cards the investigation agency first made the breakthrough and later CBI declared that the Mecca Masjid blast was part of a larger conspiracy.
 
 Most of these CDRs were collected by CBI from the   (ATS), who initially probed the Ajmer dargah bomb blast case. During cross-examination, CBI officer   admitted he had not examined service providers of various mobile phone numbers. "He has not examined the ATS Rajasthan officer as a witness from whom he had received copies of the CDRs. The CBI investigation officer did not obtain any certificate as required under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act. At least, he could have examined the ATS officer, but he failed to do so. Then, the source of getting the CDRs has not been proved,'' the order said.
