HYDERABAD: Even after the arrest of cab driver   and his wife in the  , investigators continue to probe at full pace to gather clinching evidence against the offenders.

 So far, police based the entire case on the DNA of the victim found inside the couple’s house. Cops initially, did not check the house of Rajasekhar using Luminol and multi-spectral LED torch which would have shown the blood traces in the grooves of thefloor tiles.
 
 After the forensic experts found the traces of blood with the help of technology and confronted Rajasekhar about it, he told that a chicken was sacrificed by them as part of puja. Later, the lab confirmed that theDNA found in the house matches with the victim’s.
 
 Despite obtaining some proof, investigators are certain that they need more evidence against Rajasekhar and his wife to make a good case against them.
 
 Cops are now pinning their hopes mainly on the clothes seized from the house of the accused and the feeding bottle found inside the boot of the car owned by him.
 
 “We have seized the clothes worn by the accused couple while performing the occult ritual at their house with the severed head of the baby girl. Since we could find traces of the girl’s blood on the floor, we believe that the DNA will also be on their clothes. We will send the clothes for DNA analysis,”   inspector P Venkateshwarulu toldTOI.
 
 The cellphone location details of Rajasekhar would work as corroboratory evidence. Other than the clothes, another physical evidenceseized by the cops is the feeding bottleof the girl.
 
 “When we confronted Rajasekhar about the feeding bottle found behind the spare tyre in his dickey, he came up with a funny answer initially. He said he saw someone throwing the bottle from another car on the road and picked it up. Since he does not have a child who needs bottle feeding, we did not believe him. Later, he confessed to have purchased it to feed the girl. We will send it for lab analysis,” said an investigator.
