Nagpur: Santosh Ambekar, booked four times under the Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA), dramatically surrendered before Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) AO Jain on Thursday in a case of murdering his rival Ravindra Gawande alias Balya in January last year. He was sent to jail under magisterial custody. Ambekar, who had been on the run for around a year after being booked in the Gawande murder case, had been declared a proclaimed offender by the court. In a fast-paced trial, the court had taken up the murder case and acquitted 10 accomplices of Ambekar. The sessions court had ordered a separate trial against Ambekar. Despite being a proclaimed absconder, city police had not made any attempt to seize his properties as per the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). It’s also questionable whether city police had made any efforts to nab him. Sources close to Ambekar had earlier said, on condition of anonymity, that the goon had made several trips to the city in the last one year. On Thursday, even as several senior cops remained in the dark about the surrender, a nonchalant Ambekar presented himself before the court. As Ambekar waited for the legal procedures to be completed, his cronies stayed put at the court premises. A van later whisked him away to Central Jail. It’s learnt Kalamna police, who are seeking his custody for the murder case, were not prepared with documents to seek his remand, which prompted the court to send the goon to jail. Senior PI Khushal Tijare of Kalamna police station said he will try to get seven days custody remand to question Ambekar about his role in the murder.
