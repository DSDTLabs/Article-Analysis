Kanpur: The police have launched a search for the cold storage   Vishwanath Singh Katiyar, a resident of Shivrajpur area and contractor Pappu Ram, who hails from Darbhanga (Bihar). They have gone missing following the cold storage   in Mahipalpur area of Shivrajpur. 

 “The cold storage owner and contractor have been missing while attempts are on to trace them,” said SSP Akash Kulhari.
 
 Most of the labourers engaged at the cold storage are natives of Bihar and Nepal, said police.
 
 The injured labourers identified as Mithilesh, Pawan and Lalit, all natives of Bihar, undergoig treatment at Lala Lajpat Rai hospital, told TOI that they have been hired by one Pappu Ram, a contractor from Darbhanga (Bihar). 
 
 They were paid Rs 7 for piling a single potato sack in the chamber of the cold storage, they said and added that soon after the incident, they have launched a search for Pappu and owner Katiyar. Locals, meanwhile, said over 20 to 30 people could still be under the debris but the possibility of finding more survivors at the site appears bleak as a huge pile of debris is affecting the pace of rescue operations.
 
 DM Kaushal Raj Sharma, however, said that the police will investigate the offence, which will soon be registered against the owner-contractor duo. But, the priority right now is to rescue people from the debris, he said. Personnel of fire and emergency services and NDRF carried out rescue operations overnight.
