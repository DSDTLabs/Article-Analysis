NEW DELHI: A woman was arrested for impersonating a   at a KVS primary   centre in northwest Delhi’s Mukherjee Nagar. Police said the woman was lured in by a gang, which was running a racket of placing fake candidates in competitive exams. The kingpins of the gang, police said, were inspired by the Bollywood movie Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. 

 She was caught by the invigilator after he noticed that the admit card picture didn’t match with her. 
 
 “On January 7, the principal of a public school — the centre of the exam — informed us that a woman was caught trying to impersonate a candidate,” said Milind Mahadeo Dumbere, DCP (northwest).
 
 A mobile phone, earphones, and a copper wire covered with doctor tape and attached to a small button cell were seized from her. 
 
 “The woman said two men named Anil and Johnny are running the racket. She said she had come in touch with them through two men whom she had met in Panipat,” said an officer. She claimed she was offered Rs 1 lakh for taking the exam.
 
 Police said the fake candidates would wear clothes designed specially to hide electronic gadgets. The woman said the men had told her that the button cell would be used as a bluetooth using the copper wire, which was attached to the earphone.
 
 “Once the examination started, the real candidate called her to enquire the code of the paper and started dictating her the answers,” Dumbere said. 
 
 All the accused are on the run and a hunt is on to nab them.
