Vadodara: Three days after seven Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) employees, including a ward officer, were allegedly caught consuming liquor in ward number three’s office, police are yet to file FIR against them. All the seven employees were suspended by municipal commissioner Dr Vinod Rao on Monday and an inquiry was ordered against them.  Hours within their suspension, city police commissioner Manoj Sashidhar too directed Panigate police to file FIR in the case on Monday. Panigate police inspector J G Amin, however, said the police are still inquiring about the incident. “We are gathering all the evidence. We don’t know who shot the video and when it was taken. Statements of the people present in the ward office during the incident will also be taken to ascertain the allegations.” Interestingly, the ‘liquor party’ was busted after a video showing the VMC officials consuming liquor was circulated on social media. The video shows civic employees sitting in a cabin with liquor bottles placed on the table. The moment the employees learn that they were being videographed, they rushed out of the office. “FIR will be filed if we get enough evidence against the employees as we will have to prove the case in the court too,” Amin told TOI.  Getting medical evidence might be tough for the police as the civic employees didn’t undergo blood test within 24 hours of allegedly consuming liquor. The VMC had done preliminary inquiry against the employees and a copy of the inquiry report along with copy of the video footage was handed over to the police by Rao on Monday.  The suspended employees include in-charge ward officer Dinesh Damor, sanitary inspector, Shailesh Patel, junior clerk Manu Parmar, sepoy Vijay Nikam, biologist of filarial department Mrugesh Parmar and two workers of filarial department, Ratilal Parmar and Chandrakant Parmar.
