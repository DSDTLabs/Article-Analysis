Even as the Tamil film industry looks forward to resuming work after a 48-day shut down,   Stalin has created a flutter with a tweet. 

 “Like the IPL matches, will film releases also be postponed till the Cauvery Management Board is set up? It would attract the attention of the non-performing Central and State Governments,” he tweeted late last night, after it was announced that the tripartite talks between the Tamil Film Producers Council ( ), the Digital Service Providers (DSPs), and exhibitors, mediated by the   government, had brought about an amicable resolution. 
  
  
 Recently, many Tamil filmmakers had protested against holding IPL matches in Chennai, arguing that the sporting event would be a distraction from the Cauvery protests. Following the protests, the matches involving home team Chennai Super Kings have now been shifted to Pune.
 
 It remains to be seen if Udhayanidhi will find any support from his film fraternity regarding postponement of Tamil releases. Following his tweet, his followers on social media shot back asking if he would tell the same to the Hyderabad IPL franchise (Sun Risers Hyderabad), whose owner, Kalanithi Maran, is a close relative to the producer-turned-actor.
