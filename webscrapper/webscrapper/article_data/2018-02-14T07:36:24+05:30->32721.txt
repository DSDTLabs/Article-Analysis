AHMEDABAD: Railway authorities have flagged red another   as the   connecting the   was reported to be damaged. The track was damaged between Siddhpur-Dharewada.

 The divisional railway manager Dinesh Kumar said that during patrolling, night staff realized that the track was damaged and raised the alarm. As the damage was in a small area, the movement of the train was not stopped.
 
 Kumar said that this is the third incident in the recent past and asked the staff to carry out a detailed inquiry into all the three incidents as “we fear that there could be a deliberate attempt to sabotage the track causing destruction,” he said.
 
 Kumar further said that the first incident was on Subhash Bridge where a major fire was reported from the cables, the second incident took place near Gandhidham, where nearly 100m of the track was damaged and Siddhpur-Dharwada was the third incident. In this incident, the miscreants have used a hammer to damage the track. The marks are clearly seen on the track.
 
 Sources in the railway said that the iron rod connecting the tracks to cement sleepers was broken. The officials said that the incident was reported late on Monday night and the alarm was raised. The officials said train services were not affected as the damage was small. “Trains were made to move at a speed of 30km per hour under supervision of railway staff. The track was repaired in the morning.
 
 The officials said that on January 31, a major fire in a dead high-tension cable passing near the railway tracks forced the railways to suspend train movements toward Sabarmati railway station. The fire began in the cable duct. Railway officials deputed a team of four high-level technical officers of Ahmedabad Division to inquire into the incident.
