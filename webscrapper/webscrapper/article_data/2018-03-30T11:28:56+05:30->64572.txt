MADURAI: Apprehending arrest by   police in   district after a cheating case was filed against him,   member Anwar Raja’s son   has filed an anticipatory bail petition before the Madras high court Madurai bench. 

 Based on a complaint lodged by one  , the   police had registered a case against Ali for alleged offences punishable under Sections 294 (b) (obscene acts and songs), 417 (punishment for cheating), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing deliver of property) and 506 (i) (criminal intimidation) of IPC and Section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Women Harassment Act. 
 
 According to the prosecution, Ali and Rofina had developed a cordial relationship. Later, he made a false promise to marry her. Further, he received Rs 50 lakh from her with an intention to cheat her. 
 
 Subsequently, he tried to marry another woman. When she came to know about it, Rofina questioned him, for which he abused her using filthy language and also threatened to kill her. 
 
 However, the petitioner said in his petition that he did not commit any offence. He said he and the woman had established a partnership firm in the name of ‘Narrow Media’ at Saidapet in Chennai and engaged in advertisement and movie-related works, for which they invested Rs 50 lakh. 
 
 However, the firm faced a financial crunch leading to a dispute between them. She did not accept the loss and claimed a huge sum of money from him. As he refused it, she preferred to lodge a false complaint against him, Ali claimed.
 
 He said he was ready to cooperate with the police for further investigation. His arrest would make his family suffer and ruin their reputation in the society. 
 
 Hence, he needed to be enlarged on bail in the event of his arrest or surrender in the case, he prayed.
