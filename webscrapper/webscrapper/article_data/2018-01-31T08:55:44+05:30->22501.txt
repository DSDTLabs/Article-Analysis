JODHPUR:   affected by   in Balotara and Pali observed the   by holding   at the district collectorate and submitted a memorandum to the divisional commissioner demanding compensation for the loss to farmers in the region and compliance of the directions of the high court and the   passed from time to time.

 Under the banner of Kisan Paryavaran Sangharsh Samiti, over a hundred farmers held Nadi Satyagraha to raise their voices against the killing of rivers like Luni, Jojari and Bandi on account of indiscriminate discharge of industrial effluents and devastation of the agrarian economy and environment of the surrounding region.
 
 General secretary of the samiti Mahaveer Singh Sukarlai said that all the farmers and environmentalists have been struggling to save these rivers which are referred to as Maru Ganga of Marwar region from the constant discharge from industrial units in Barmer’s Balotara, Bithuja and Pali city.
 
 “We have taken the matter to high court and with NGT from time to time, which have issued stringent orders towards the revival of these rivers but unfortunately, hardly any of these orders have been complied with by the administration,” Sukarlai said.
 
 They have submitted a memorandum to the divisional commissioner demanding compliance of these directions, compensation for the loss caused to the farmers due to contamination of rivers and ground water and complete check on any discharge of unnatural water into these rivers.
 
 Sukarlai said that National Productivity Survey in 1996 had pegged an estimated loss to the farmers at Rs 200 crore but nothing has happened since then.
 
 “Also, things have not changed and rather worsened further undermining the environment and agrarian prospects in the region leaving the farmers with no option but to look for alternatives of agriculture,” he said.
 
 It may be recalled that the directions of NGT had led to the closure of units in Pali for nine months and in Balotara and Bithuja for six months but according to the demonstrators, what the administration has done in the name of compliance of these directions was nothing but an eye-wash.
 
 Environmentalists and farmers have also demanded a project on the lines of Ganga Action Plan for salvaging the small rivers under threat terming them to be more important than saving the big rivers.
