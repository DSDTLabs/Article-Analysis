KOCHI: A 55-year-old brain dead woman from West Bengal gave a new lease of life to two Malayalis after her family decided to donate her kidneys.   would probably be Kerala's first organ donor from outside the state. Bose had come on a holiday with her family to Alappuzha when she suddenly felt breathless and collapsed inside a houseboat. She was shifted to a private hospital to Alappuzha and then to   hospital, where she was declared brain dead. 

 "We decided to donate her kidneys as it would save the lives of two people and it will also help us to keep her memory alive. We hope that our decision to donate organs will encourage other people too to donate their organs across borders," said Bose's husband  . 
 
 The kidneys were transplanted to Philip T A (55) of Anchal in Kollam and Makkar T M (61) of Mulavoor in Ernakulam at VPS Lakeshore on Friday.
