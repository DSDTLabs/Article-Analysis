NEW DELHI: The government is contemplating to approach the World Trade Organization’s (WTO’s) dispute settlement body against the US move to raise import duty on aluminium and steel.

 
 Sources told TOI that detailed discussions have been held in the commerce department. Former officials dealing with   were also consulted on the issue. While a section believes that there is a case for a strong response, another view in the government is to wait for other WTO members to move the dispute settlement body so that India can then join in.
 
 A senior government official said India also needs to be careful, given its massive interest in terms of presence of software and other professionals in the US as well as the large software exports. Software accounts for a little under half the services exports from the country, of which almost 80% is headed for the US, with American companies depending on Indian counterparts as well as professionals.
 
 Trade tensions have increased in recent months with US President   targeting India along with China and other countries. Last week, the US sought consultations with India through the WTO dispute settlement body over half-a-dozen export promotion schemes. American authorities said these schemes were offering subsidies that impacted its business and workers.
 
 Officials said the US action on steel and aluminium had set a dangerous precedent, which had the potential of thwarting a rule-based trading system operating under the WTO regime. They added that currently the government is taking a legal view and a decision on future course of action will be taken soon.
