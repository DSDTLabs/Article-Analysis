PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Municipal corporations have been asked to prepare detailed project reports on development works being delayed because of non-availability of land. 

 They have to include reserved lands and the permissions taken from various government departments in the project reports. Earlier this month, the state had issued a resolution in this regard. 
 
 In 2015-16, the   had noted that municipal corporations and councils were presenting development project reports to the government or other agencies without acquiring land. “There are either encroachments or land has not been acquired. Projects have not been carried out with requisite permissions from government departments according to the development plan,” the samiti said. 
 
 In 2015, the  , under the   National Urban Renewal Mission, failed to acquire land for slum rehabilitation projects to be carried out at Sector 22 in Nigdi, the link road between Pimpri and Chinchwad, Vetalnagar, Milindnagar, Vithalnagar and Ajanthanagar. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) found irregularities in the implementation of the PCMC project on the link road. 
 
 Slum rehabilitation projects sanctioned between September 2006 and March 2012 were analysed by the sanctioning and monitoring committee in 14 civic corporations of the state, including Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad.
 
 “The availability of land was not ascertained by the municipal corporations or their consultants before preparing detailed project reports. An expenditure of Rs5.79 crore incurred on consultancy fee towards preparing the DPRs proved to be ‘infructuous’,” the CAG report noted.
