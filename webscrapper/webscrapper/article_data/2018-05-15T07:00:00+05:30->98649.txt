Ludhiana: The court of chief judicial magistrate Suresh Kumar Goyal acquitted Sikh radical Jagtar Singh Hawara in a 1995 arms recovery case on Monday. Hawara was booked at the then Kotwali police station on December 30, 1995. 

 Police had claimed in the case that Hawara was caught with an AK-56 assault rifle and 50 cartridges. Hawara has been convicted of the assassination of former chief minister Beant Singh.
 
 On April 9, the court of Varinder Kumar, judicial magistrate first class (JMIC), had convicted Hawara in the arms case. He appealed against the conviction in the court of chief judicial magistrate on April 13.
 
 During the hearing of the case, Hawara’s counsel, Jaspal Singh Manjhpur, informed the court that Hawara had been convicted based on wrong facts. The defence counsel added that Hawara participated in the hearing through video-conferencing from Tihar Jail in Delhi.
 
 The counsel informed the court that Hawara had made a disclosure statement in which he had informed the police about the AK-56 rifle, two magazines of AK-56, and 50 cartridges of AK-56. He had given them information that the firearm and ammunition had been in a rubber tube behind a cremation ground. A separate disclosure statement of Hawara under section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act to this effect was recorded separately in the presence of witnesses. 
 
 The police party proceeded towards the place disclosed by accused in a government vehicle. Led by Hawara, the police party seized the weapon. The defence counsel argued that for sentencing in an arms act, the weapon should be in working condition and must be test-fired. He added that police did not test-fire or check the weapon. He said the police also didn’t check the 50 cartridges. 
 
 He added that there was no seal on the AK 56 to indicate its particulars.
