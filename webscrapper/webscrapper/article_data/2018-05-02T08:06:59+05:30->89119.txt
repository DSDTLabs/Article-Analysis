BHOPAL: The   (NHRC) on Tuesday issued a notice to the   for   at a   in Dhar, even as the state   over the controversy.

 
 The media reports, if true, indicate discriminatory and derogatory treatment meted out to candidates of reserved categories, says the NHRC notice issued to state chief secretary and DGP. “Such despicable act on the part of the authorities cannot be tolerated under any circumstances in a civilized society, as it is a tantamount to violation of right to equality and dignity,” it adds. NHRC has asked for a report within four weeks on action taken against the officers.
 
 The branding has triggered nationwide outrage, with Congress President Rahul Gandhi accusing the BJP government of “knifing the nation's heart with its casteist attitude”, and BSP chief Mayawati calling it a “criminal act”.
 
 On Tuesday, MP home minister Bhupendra Singh tweeted that police inspector Nanuram Verma and SI of Special Armed Forces, Nanuram Movale, have been suspended, and the Dhar collector ordered to take action against the doctors responsible for branding the candidates.
 
 Senior police officers initially maintained that there was no ill-intention behind branding the candidates. Those conducting the medical examination had told police that they had marked candidates on their chest with SC or ST as physical requirements for these categories are different from general candidates. For instance, an ST candidate gets a relaxation of 8cm in height.
 
 After the controversy erupted, Dhar SP Birendra Kumar Singh said there was no instruction from the department to brand candidates, and that it was done during medical examination at the district government hospital.
