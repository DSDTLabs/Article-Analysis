LUCKNOW: Close to 700 projects worth Rs 50,000 crore will be cleared to start work on ground in UP in the next month or two. The government will be holding a ground breaking ceremony with proponents of these projects, many of whom signed MoUs with the state during the Investors’ Summit.

 
 Prime Minister   is likely to preside over the ceremony.
 
 Companies like ACC Cement, Greenply,  , Ambani, Adani, Birla, Berger Paints, DCM Sriram, Goldy Masala, Haldiram, PayTM, Metro Cash and Carry, Infosys etc., will be part of the mega event, which, infrastructure and industrial development commissioner   said would now be held every two months. During the Investors’ Summit, UP government had signed more than 1,000 MoUs worth over Rs 4.28 lakh crore.
 
 “Proponents of more than 80 units, each with an investment of at least Rs 50 crore, will be felicitated in Lucknow. Another 600-odd units which are investing varying smaller amounts, will participate in ceremonies in their respective districts. These will be presided over by the district magistrates etc. The smaller units will account for about Rs 1,000 crore of the Rs 50,000 crore,” Pandey said.
 
 The ground breaking event will include a ceremonial laying of a foundation stone, felicitation of the investors, a sector-wise seminar and an employment camp. “The projects that have been identified are those which already have land available with them or where land can be made available immediately, and have already submitted their detailed project reports to the government or will be doing so shortly. Based on the DPRs, the government will give them letters of comfort with details of concessions, provisions applicable to their projects etc. Whereever possible, clearances will also be accorded.
 
 The infrastructure and industrial development commissioner has directed officers concerned to issue provisional letters of comfort to these investors as soon as possible,” said sources.
