THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Assembly witnessed unruly scenes on Thursday after the opposition moved an adjournment motion notice against attacks on RMP workers at Onchiam in Vadakara constituency. The zero hour was disrupted for about thirty minutes, followed by which the opposition staged a walkout.

 Though the adjournment motion notice moved by IUML member   was against ‘CPM’s atrocities against workers of various political parties in Nadapuram, Vadakara and Kuttiady areas’, the focus turned out to be on the violence in Onchiam last month, involving CPM and RMP workers. A verbal spat broke out when the speaker allowed  , the JD(S) MLA from Vadakara to speak (as the matter concerned his constituency), which opposition leader   said was being done purposefully to defeat the spirit of the UDF’s arguments. Opposition members raised slogans against the speaker’s decision and disrupted Nanu’s speech.
 
 
 Speaker   temporarily suspended the proceedings. Nanu, however, was allowed to speak after the House reassembled.
 
 CM   said ‘the sponsors of RMP were now desperate after seeing the party’s decline in Onchiam’. Parakkal Abdulla, he said was one among the sponsors of RMP, when the party was formed. “Around 300 RMP workers re-joined CPM, which led to the violence. It’s been a month since the incident took place, and an adjournment motion at this stage is politically motivated,” he said.
 
 Chennithala before staging the walkout said: “The CM’s remarks against Abdulla show the wrath the CPM still has against him for defeating K K Lathika in Kuttiady.”
