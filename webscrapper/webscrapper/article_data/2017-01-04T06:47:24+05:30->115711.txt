NEW DELHI: The non-functional toilet complex in Inderpuri Gas Godown Jhuggi, where BJP MP   camped overnight on December 31, was flushed and restored on Tuesday. An executive engineer of the   came here with water tankers on Monday , January 2, and had all the 20 toilet cubicles, which had excreta overflowing in them, flushed.

 Ahead of the municipal polls, Tiwari proposed to go on a “reality check“ around the slum clusters by staying overnight to see for himself how the low-wage labour force of the city lived. The house where Tiwari spent the New Year's Eve had no toilet -like all the other hou seholds in the slum cluster -and he had to use the public facility early next morning, only to find them overflowing with urine and excreta.
 
 The women of the slum -subject to the daily indignity of open defecation -beseeched the   chief to construct private toilets in their jhuggis or, at the least, make the existing public toilet complex functional.
 
 The usual round of political recriminations and blame game erupted soon after with the BJP and AAP leaders pointing finger at each other for the sorry state of affairs at this slum cluster.
 
 Vijender Garg, AAP MLA, inaugurated the public toilet complex last year, which, locals claim, has been without water for a month. The complex has no piped water supply and depends upon a borewell, which apparently ran dry soon after the complex was opened to the public. Sanjay Thakur, a local BJP leader, said the slum-dwellers were running from pillar to post to have the toilets flushed regularly but nobody cared about it till Manoj Tiwari visited the slum.
 
 But, the larger picture that emerges is that the slum is part of the New Delhi parliamentary constituency represented by BJP's Meenakshi Lekhi. Lekhi, as a national spokeswoman of the party, tirelessly promoted Prime Minister's Swachh Bharat mission.
