AHMEDABAD: The city police commissioner A K Singh has warned police inspectors posted in police stations and important agencies strongly about keeping watch on suspicious activities of “vahivatdars” (cops who work as   collection agents for their higher ups) or face strict action including suspension.

 In a letter to all inspectors of police stations and agencies on Saturday, Singh writes that incidents like the July 2009 hooch tragedy was the result of connivance between such   and criminals. The hooch tragedy claimed some 150 lives and left 250 people affected in the city.
 
 The letter warns that repetition of incidents involving vahivatdars and a nexus with criminals would draw strict action against the concerned inspector and personnel.
 
 The city police chief expressed anguish at the fact that despite transfers of such vahivatdars, they continue their nefarious activities directly or indirectly in their old jurisdictions or in jurisdictions of other police stations.
 
 The commissioner warned that strict action would be taken against personnel indulging in such activities either in their jurisdiction or any other area of the city.
 
 Top police officials said inspectors have been asked prevent such activities in their area.
 
 "The letter shot by the police commissioner warns police inspectors of suspension if found to be sheltering such Vahivatdars" added a top police official.
 
 It is noteworthy that recently a team comprising of 40 police personnels and officials from Sector -1 of the city was directed to conduct raids on liquor Mafias and bootleggers in   and   falling within the jurisdiction of Sector -2, that is the eastern part of the city.
 
 "A huge quantity of country made liquor and wash used to make country made liquor was found during the raids" added a senior police official.
