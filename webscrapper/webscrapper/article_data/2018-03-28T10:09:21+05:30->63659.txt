CHANDIGARH: Heaps of dry leaves lying in parks have become a matter of concern for the residents of Sector 19 and 21. Residents complain that sweepers leave behind the dry leaves in various parks, which come under municipal corporation. 

 Baljinder Singh Bittu, president of the citizen association in Sector 21 and  , said the authorities are planning to get rid of the dry leaves by decomposing it. He said the issue was raised with the corporation to arrive at a permanent solution. 
 
 Hitesh Puri, vice-chairman of FOSWAC, also raised the issue in the recent RWA meeting questioning why MC authorities are not chalking out a plan for the disposal of dry leaves. He added there are several hi-tech machines which can be utilised for the purpose instead of depending on manual collection of the dry leaves, which is the prime reason behind delay in action. 
 
 In the recent meeting, mayor   held a special meeting with the MC officials and asked them to bring into use additional infrastructure of 16 tractor trolleys, along with staff, to clear the dry leaves. At present there are 28 gardens in the city, where dry leaves have been disposed of in the park to create manure and authorities are soon to consider the same process for other parks too. 
 
 In 2002, the then UT advisor,   had initiated a project called   and   in Sectors including 15, 21, 26, 27, 33 and 36. Under this project, the authorities in these sectors installed infrastructure for decomposing dry leaves through vermin-culture to make fertilizer and further use it in green belts of the city.
