BENGALURU: The  , which is struggling to find buyers for its flats, has decided to rope in private professional marketing agencies to pursue their sale.

 The BDA has over 2,000 unsold flats across the city and it feels private marketing professionals, especially those armed with management degrees, will help in clearing the inventory. The town planning authority has invited bids from private marketing consultants through the tender process; the last date is February 19.
 
 N G Gowdaiah, BDA officer in charge of housing projects, said: “This is one way of reaching out to people effectively. What we normally do is issue a notification, that too only once. But according to the feedback we received, the public is largely unaware that BDA even builds houses. We want to make our projects more visible as they are of good quality and affordable. Once we get the bids, we will see if such a project is worth undertaking.” Some enquiries have already been made from firms based in Bengaluru and Delhi.
 ‘No offers, discounts’
 
 “There will be no scope for attracting the attention of buyers by using words like ‘offer’ or ‘discount’, but there might be a website, along the lines of the existing real estate portals, that will showcase our products exclusively,” he said.
 
 The contract with private agencies will be for two years, Gowdaiah said.
 
 
 
 
 It is expected that a spike in demand for the flats will also result in better collection of dues.
 According to Gowdaiah, BDA is owed money to the tune of Rs 500 crore from persons to whom its flats have been allotted. “There are owners who are yet to pay the full amount as there’s inefficient collection from our side. Once the allotment is done, 12.5% of the sum has to be given as down payment, following which the remaining would be paid at a rate of 25% every two months. Delays in sending notifications and collecting penalties have led to this issue. We want to manage it more efficiently in future,” he said.
