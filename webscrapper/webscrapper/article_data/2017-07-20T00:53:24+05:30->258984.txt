Trichy: Three houses were destroyed in a fire in   in Trichy in the early hours of Wednesday resulting in lossed to the tune of Rs 20 lakh. 

 The fire broke out atop a tiled roof house of Subramani on the bank of the temple tank near Sri Subramaniaswamy temple in Vayalur around 2am. Subramani was one of the priests in the temple. A spark from a live electric wire crossing the house is suspected to have caused the fire in the house. As soon as the roof caught fire, residents sleeping in the house rushed out to safety. However, the heavy winds spread the fire to the neighbouring houses including some thatched roof huts. 
 
 The houses went up in flames. Two other houses of a priest, Ganesan and a vegetable vendor also caught fire. Several employees of the temple run by Hindu religious and charitable endowment department are residing around the temple. 
 
 “Fortunately, all the residents in the houses escaped without any injury because of the timely alertness of the people. But the fire ravaged the houses completely and destroyed the valuables,” said a resident, Rajendran. 
 
 The villagers gathered and took efforts to douse the fire which went on uncontrolled. By the time fire and rescue service personnel were informed, the fire had ravaged all the three houses before the fire service personnel reached the spot. The fire fighters brought the situation under control after an hour. 
 
 During inquiry with the resident, the Somarasampettai police were informed that the fire had caused losses to the tune of Rs 20 lakh. Police have registered a case and are probing the incident.
