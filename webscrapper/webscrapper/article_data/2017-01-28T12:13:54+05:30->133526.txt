BENGALURU: When   began wielding Bluetooth-printer-enabled Blackberry phones a decade ago, it was ground-breaking, but the technology is now obsolete. Traffic cops recently realized this when enforcement was severely hit in the wake of November 8 demonetization of high-denomination notes.

 However, traffic police are now back with a brand-new device which they believe will give their enforcement drives more teeth. The new device has a camera, a printer, a point of sale (POS) option, and a direct link to the  . It'll not only generate challans on the spot, but also allow traffic police to collect fines by way of credit and debits cards from erring motorists. It will have a backend software integrated with the RTO and the national vehicle database and field-deployed health devices. The system is also integrated with the exist ing   system, red light violation system, and speed-detection system for generation of challans.
 
 At present, traffic police have 621 Blackberry phones for officers above the rank of assistant sub-inspector. “Compared to the older devices, the new one is costly. So, we are inducting them in phases,“ said the officer in charge of introducing the new device. The department will start phasing out the older ones by the beginning of February, he said.
 
 The camera attached to the machine can take a photo of the violation and create a challan on the spot or send it to the traffic management centre for issuing challan. According to senior police officers, the role of these devices aren't just limited to enforcement. “The machine is integrated to the vehicle database. So, during a law-and-order situation, these machines can be used to identify the vehicles quickly,“ a senior officer pointed out.
