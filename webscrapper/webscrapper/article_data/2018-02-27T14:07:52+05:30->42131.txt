NAGPUR: German company SCHUKO is close to acquiring robotic technology for cleaning ducts of air ventilation systems, developed by a Nagpur start-up  .

 The companies are close to finalizing commercial terms of the deal, said Jay   of   at a press conference here. The technology was showcased during a visit of German business delegation to Nagpur.
