PATNA: Over five lakh people from Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal are likely to attend the ‘Deen Bachao, Desh Bachao’   at the historic Gandhi Maidan here from 1pm to 5pm this Sunday.

 The meet, which is open for all, is being organized by Imarat Shariah under the banner of All India Muslim Personal Law Board.
 
 “Corruption has spread its tentacles in the country and there are hardly any jobs. Crime against women is on the rise and people are pitted against each other in the name of religion. This conference is an attempt to discuss the deteriorating social situation in the country and spread peace,” said Imarat Shariah’s general secretary Maulana Anisur Rahman Quasmi at a press conference organised at a city hotel on Friday.
 
 Calling it “a non-political” event, Quasmi told mediapersons no politician had been invited to the April 15 conference. He, however, pointed out that no political party would be stopped from attending the meet.
 
 Quasmi also hailed the Indian Constitution and urged everyone to put an end to the hatred towards other religions. “The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the country, guarantees the right to equality to every citizen. This means we all have to be treated equally irrespective of caste, religion, age, gender or class,” he said.
 
 Representatives of different non-governmental organizations have also been invited to the conference.
