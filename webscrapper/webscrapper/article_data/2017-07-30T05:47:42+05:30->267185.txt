KOLKATA: CID officers, who questioned   MP   in the   on Saturday, claimed they were “far from being satisfied“ with her replies. Sources indicated she might be summoned again.

 “Some inconsistencies have emerged in her statements in the light of some evidence that we possess. We might have to interrogate her again,“ said ADG (CID)   after his team -comprising five personnel, including lady officers -questioned Ganguly for more than two hours, between 11.15am and 1.30pm, at the MP's residence.
 
 Top sources in CID claimed the MP denied that she ever gave any instruction to former party leader Juhi Chowdhury, asking her to meet either officials of the women and child planning department at the Centre or representatives of the women's commission. “Yet, we have excerpts from her text messages to Chowdhury and her conversations with the accused where it is indicative that she was giving instructions to Chowdhury while she was in Delhi. In addition, certain statements made by at least two of the accused -Chowdhury being one of them -do not match with what Ganguly told us today. We are planning to question her next time armed with more evidence,“ said an officer.
 
 CID sources said they quizzed Ganguly to know what exactly transpired on February 2 when both were in Delhi to meet a Union minister. Ganguly, though, appeared calm as she faced the interrogators on Saturday morning. “I have not taken any anticipatory bail. The chief minister has not seen incidents like child trafficking.Thus, it seems she does not know what to do,“ she told the media from the first-floor of her Golf Green residence.
 
 After the interrogators left, Ganguly reiterated that she believed that Chowdhury -considered her close aide -was not involved in the case. “I firmly believe that the girl can't be involved in something so nasty . Yet, I want the law to take its own course,“ she said, citing it as a case of political vendetta.
