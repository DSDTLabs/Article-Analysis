CHENNAI: AIADMK   A   was on Monday elected as the   of the  . The key post in the board has been filled after nearly two years.

 In February, the   government cancelled the election to the post after some members of the board opposed secret ballot. On February 25, the BC, MBC and minorities welfare department asked the chief executive officer (CEO) Darez Ahamed to adjourn the meeting of the board for election after former chairman A Tamilmahan Hussain and two others opposed secret ballot. The opposing members said the CEO’s plan to hold a secret ballot did not have precedence.
 
 On Monday, Hussain did not turn up for the election. “Raajhaa was the only candidate to file nominations, and he was elected unanimously,” said a senior official.
 
 The members of the board were elected in September last, and Raajhaa was the only Muslim MP to be nominated. 
 
 “Although, the tenure of the board is five years, Raajahaa’s membership will come to an end when his tenure as an MP ends in May 2018. If he is not elected then, the board has to be reconstituted,” said MLA KS Masthan, who is one of the members.
