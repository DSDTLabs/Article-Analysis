 Rahul, a student of class IX, was found dead on the campus of his school on April 10, 2015. The police had closed the case as suicide. 
 
 First moved on March 16, 2016, the petition sought a CBI probe into the matter. However, the court was informed that the police had already prepared a final report in the case in October 2015. Rohit then filed a protest petition in the court of the chief judicial magistrate (CJM). On February 12, 2017, the CJM court rejected the final report of the police. 
 
 The CJM had also directed the police to make further investigation for offences of murder, conspiracy and attempt to remove evidence.
