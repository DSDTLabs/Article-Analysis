PANAJI:   state unit president   on Sunday said that the party will soon form the government in Karnataka after the assembly election and the dispute over   waters will be resolved after it comes to power in the neighbouring state.

 Tendulkar said the party is waiting for the Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal ruling and based on the order, BJP national president Amit   will come up with a solution on the issue. “Shah already has a plan in mind and he will solve the problem. We are waiting for the tribunal’s orders. After forming a government in Karnataka, we will find a solution,” Tendulkar said. 
 
 A row erupted recently after CM Manohar Parrikar wrote to BJP’s Karnataka chief B S Yeddyurappa that the Goa government was willing to supply drinking water only to drought-prone areas in the neighbouring state. 
 
 This saw protests from Goans as well as Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah, who said the letter should have been addressed to his office instead.
