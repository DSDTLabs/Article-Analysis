JAIPUR: State BJP consolidated its position in the Upper House after its three nominees were elected unopposed to   on Thursday.

 Returning officer Akhil Arora declared  ,   and   victorious on Thursday, which was the last day for withdrawing the nominations. The opposition had not fielded any candidate. ``As only these three candidates had filed their nominations for the three seats, they have been declared winners,’’ said Arora.
 
 
 All the 10 seats in the Rajya Sabha from the state are now held by the BJP. ``It a matter of great pride for the state BJP that all the   from the state belong to BJP,’’ said state BJP president Ashok Parnami.
 
 48-year-old Yadav, who is also the national general secretary of the party, would be serving his second term. While he was not present in person at the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly to collect his victory certificate, Meena and Yadav, along with their supporters, collected theirs.
 
 ``I am a public representative and I will always remain among the masses. I will take the good work of the state and the Central government to them,’’ said Meena, who returned to BJP on Sunday, a decade after quitting it following differences with chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Though accepting the party’s decision to nominate him for the Rajya Sabha, 66-year-old Meena has since made it clear that he is not in agreement and will be more comfortable among the voters back home.
 
 Saini, who was the surprise card played by the BJP, said that he would ensure proper representation of the state in the Rajya Sabha, particularly that of the farmers. 75-yearold Saini’s name was proposed by Raje with the aim of strengthening the party’s support among the OBCs and to gain the confidence of its party workers.
 
 Elections were being held on three of the 10 seats as tenures of Yadav along with two Congress MPs Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Narendra Budania end on April 3.
