 Tourist vehicles heading to Karnataka often rush to cross the Thorappalli Check Post as it closes by 8.30pm. The stretch between Thorappalli Check Post and Kakkanallah Check Post in Karnataka is closed from 8.30pm to 6am as it is a tiger reserve area.
 
 “During the summer season, as many as 10 vehicles met with accidents between Naduvattam and Gudalur, a stretch of 17km,” a social activist said. “After visiting the tourist spots here, Karnataka tourists leave Ooty by 6pm. Crossing Thorappalli, which is 50km away, by 8.30pm is impossible given the heavy traffic. If they don’t hurry, they get stranded at the check post till the next morning. Authorities should impose a speed limit in the Naduvattam-Gudalur stretch to check road accidents,” he said.
