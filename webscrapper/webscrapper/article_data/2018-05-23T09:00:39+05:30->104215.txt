JAIPUR: A young girl underwent a rare surgery at Mahila Chikitsalaya of   Medical College a week ago, to create a  . The girl had arrived at the hospital as her family was worried that she had not yet got her periods, although she had turned 17.

 
 Gynaecologist and senior professor  , who treated the girl, said, “She is otherwise well-built and had no other ailments. She had not got her period, and we found that she had no vagina or a uterus. She has healthy ovaries. This is a condition called congenital  . We performed laparoscopic surgery, advancing the peritoneum (lining of the  ) and using it for creating the vagina.

 Dr. Nagar said the parents of the girl are keen on getting her married once she turns 18. “The girl can have a normal married life, but she will not be able to bear children except through surrogacy since she has ovaries but no uterus,” the doctor said.
