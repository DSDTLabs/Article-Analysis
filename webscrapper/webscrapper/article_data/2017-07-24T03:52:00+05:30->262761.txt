Nagpur: “People in many parts of north-eastern states feel alienated for which concerted efforts should be made to bring them into the mainstream,” said Alka Sarma, a social worker from Assam.

 Sarma was replying to the felicitation after receiving the ‘Dr Girish Gandhi Rashtriya Samaji Karya Puraskar 2017’ given by SM Zade Foundation’s Satyanarayan Nuval Gurukul Vyasanmukti Kendra at Sai Sabhagruha, Shankar Nagar. The award was given for her outstanding contribution to educating adivasi children and empowerment of women in Assam. 
 
 Sarma said, “My husband, a public representative, was killed in his own constituency when my daughter was only 10 years old. But I told myself that I should not get bogged down and work for the welfare of the society because, according to Mahayan Buddhist philosophy, we need to take everyone along to seek moksha.” 
 
 Minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir and chairperson of Maharashtra State Women’s Commission Vijaya Rahatkar were the chief guests.
 
 Addressing the gathering, Ahir said, “The central government has been trying to settle disputes in north-eastern states. The government got success in many states on this front. Social workers like Sarma can change the situation for better by spreading the message of humanity and also inspire activists to discharge their duty towards society.”
 
 Rahatkar praised Sarma for helping women to become independent. “A woman like Sarma gives strength to people. I regularly meet women who are abused because of addiction problem in their family. Women are strong and can reform addicts.”
 
 Rajesh Singh, Ruth Yangada, GJ Jwani and Ravindra Nikam were also felicitated for helping people affected by addiction. Mayor Nanda Jichkar, MP Ajay Sancheti, founder of Sarhad NGO Sanjay Nahar and founder of The Earth Savoir Ravi Kalra were present.
