GHAZIABAD: The arrest of two persons for trying to   a medical store owner in Ghaziabad has revealed that the plan to eliminate him had allegedly been hatched by his brother-in-law in Dasna  .

 Police said the two arrested men — Dilshad and Ankush — had been promised Rs 5 lakh for carrying out the murder and had even been paid a token amount. The two had barged into Dev Medical Store in Sahibabad on March 21 along with an accomplice, Gulshan, but had shot at the store attendant instead of the owner Hemant Tyagi in a case of mistaken identity.
 
 Bablu, the store attendant, was hit by three bullets but survived the attack.
 
 “The entire plan had been hatched by   inside Dasna jail, where is lodged for the abduction and murder of his wife Swati. The families of Rahul and Hemant did not share a cordial relationship. Rahul nursed a grudge against Hemant, who he thought was instrumental in delaying his bail,” Ghaziabad SP (City)   said.
