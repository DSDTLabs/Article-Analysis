LUCKNOW:   chief Mayawati chose her 61st birthday on Sunday to accuse the opposition parties, including the BJP,   and Congress, of colluding to stop her party from winning UP, and hit out at the saffron party for targeting her family members over alleged corruption charges.

 Placing herself squarely against the BJP, Mayawati said it was only BSP, not an SP-Congress combine, which could stop the saffron party from coming to power in UP in 2017 and thereby dampen the BJP’s prospects in 2019   elections.
 
 Mayawati said, “BSP’s core vote base is not divided like that of SP where warring Yadav camps would contest elections not to win but to defeat each other. “It’s only the BSP which can stop BJP from coming to power and take anti-people decision like demonetisation and from SP’s reign of terror of goons and mafia.” Her press conference lasted for over an hour and was relayed live on social media platforms.
 
 Mayawati slammed the BJP for targeting her brother   over money deposited in bank accounts saying it showed the party’s desperation to malign her. But such allegations, she said, would only help her party grow stronger.
