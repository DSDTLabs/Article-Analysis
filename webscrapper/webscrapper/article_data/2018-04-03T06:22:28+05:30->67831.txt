LUCKNOW: After  , the private agency hired for garbage disposal, received flak from public and corporators for not ensuring cleanliness in colonies,   has chalked out a special plan to achieve 100% garbage disposal in entire city in a phase-wise manner. 

 In the first phase, LMC has selected 40 wards where it it plans to ensure all-round cleanliness. Most of these chosen wards, however, mostly house VIPs and affluent people, including the mayor, leaving out those colonies which needed most attention. 
 
 Under the new plan, LMC staff will follow Eco Green vehicles in the morning and ensure 100% garbage collection and cleaning of streets in the 40 wards. This has to be achieved by April 15. 
 
 The list includes wards of Niralanagar, Indiranagar, Hazratganj, Vikramaditya Marg, Paper Mill Colony, Aliganj,   and nearby areas of Cantonment.
 
 Likewise, 40 wards - five in each zone - will be selected in the second phase. Since there are 110 wards, work will begin in remaining 30 wards in the first two weeks of May for achieving 100% cleanliness. The next two weeks will be used to ensure that no ward is left unclean or devoid of authorised garbage collectors.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner   said, "This roster will ensure all-round cleanliness by May-end. Our sanitary inspectors and staff will move with Eco Green vehicles and will sweep streets and collect garbage."
 
 Most people complain that Eco Green staffers don't wait after ringing doorbell and leave without collecting garbage. "The joint effort will ensure that collectors visit all houses while sanitary workers clean streets," he said.
