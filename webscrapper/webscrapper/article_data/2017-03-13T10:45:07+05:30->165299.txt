PANAJI: The   lost eight constituencies in the elections with a 2.18% decline in its vote share. While the party earned a simple majority of 21 seats in the 2012 elections, it could win only 13 seats this time, garnering a vote share of 32.5% as against 34.68% registered in March 2012. Though BJP contested more seats than in 2012, the decline in percentage could be attributed to regional parties and independent candidates cutting into its share. Target votes of both MGP and BJP are more or less same.

 Poll pundits believe some votes of BJP may have gone to MGP candidates, especially, in constituencies such as   and Siolim, where its candidates faced anti-incumbency.
 
 Statistics also indicate that in constituencies like Shiroda, Curchorem, Dabolim, Navelim, Ponda, Savordem and Shiroda, where MGP-GSM candidates received significant votes, could have gone to BJP.
