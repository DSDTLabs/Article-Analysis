MUMBAI: Records of fatalities for 2016 reveal that the total number of deaths due to passengers falling off trains has come down by nearly 20%. 

  In 2015, a total of 806 commuters fell to their death, but last year the figure was 657. The decrease in the number of fatalities has been witnessed across all three lines, including Western Railway (WR), Central Railway (CR) and Harbour line.
 
 In October 2016, WR augmented the number of services to reduce congestion in the Andheri-Virar belt. It increased four services each in the up and down directions and extended 10 services. In December 2016, WR replaced twelve 12-car services with a 15-car prototypes, which increased the carrying capacity of rakes by almost 25%.
 
 Statistics provided by the Government Railway Police (GRP) indicate a drop in deaths on the Andheri-Virar belt reduced to 133 (2016) from 156 (2015).
 
 On the Harbour line route, the casualties have come down due to augmentation of 9-car rakes to 12-car prototypes. The process to augment the capacity began in April 2016 and culminated in September 2016.
 
 On Harbour line, the number of deaths registered cumulatively between Wadala, Vashi and Panvel station by the GRP was 138 (2016) as against 150 (2015).
 
 On CR’s Main line, the number of deaths registered was 308 in 2016, the corresponding figure for 2015 was 395. In 2016, CR introduced more more than 40 services and also undertook the modification of seats in 8-rake trains, improving the carrying capacity. 
 
 The WR administration said its campaign to deter people from travelling in packed trains is bearing fruit. 
 
 “We have taken several steps to reduce overcrowding. More services in the rush hour have been introduced in the Andheri-Virar belt. Twelve-car rakes have been replaced by 15-car ones and 9-car prototypes by 12-car models on Harbour line,” said WR’s divisional railway manager Mukul Jain.
