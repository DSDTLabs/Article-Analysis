JALALABAD:   MP and party candidate from prestigious Jalalabad assembly constituency   on Monday cautioned people that after the  , it was AAP that was allegedly using the radicals to come to power in Punjab and this could “vitiate the atmosphere”.

 “The links of AAP chief   with the radicals have repeatedly been exposed. It is too well known a fact that AAP has solicited the support of the United Akali Dal that is the front organisation of the radicals,” he said.
 
 It is the leaders from this party that had adopted the Khalistan resolution at ‘Sarbat Khalsa’ (congregation of Sikhs), Bittu, grandson of late chief minister Beant Singh, said.
 
 On the other hand, he said, the Akali Dal is in league with the Damdami Taksal that was the nursery of terrorism in the state. “It was then Congress chief minister Beant Singh who restored peace after more than a decade of bloodletting for which he had to sacrifice his life,” Bittu, who is fighting a battle against deputy chief minister   from his pocket borough, said.
 
 He alleged both Kejriwal and Sukhbir could go to any extent to grab power and means were not important for them. Both extreme left and extreme right elements were now either part of AAP or supporting this party to create anarchy in Punjab, Bittu said.
