COIMBATORE: The   on Sunday asked the ex-servicemen to refrain from misusing the canteen and polyclinic facilities provided to them. Pointing to the practise of some army veterans selling liquor and other articles purchased from the canteen in black market, general officer commanding in-chief of Southern Command P M Hariz said such practices should be stopped immediately.

 “From household items to healthcare products, almost everything is available in Army canteens. A section of ex-servicemen is found to misuse the facility as they buy things with an intention to sell them in black market. It’s an infringement on the privileges of other veterans shopping for their personal use. So, the facility should be used for the family members and their dependents,” Hariz said.
 
 He also urged the ex-servicemen to make use of the veterans support system cell that would be opened at the canteens from this April. “The veterans can approach the cell for any assistance regarding pension schemes and others,” the official said.
 
 Hariz was speaking at the grievances meeting for ex-servicemen at Suguna auditorium on   here. Conducted by the   under the aegis of Headquarters Dakshin Bharat area of the army in Coimbatore, thousands of ex-servicemen with their family members participated in the event.
 
 Addressing the gathering, Hariz said many soldiers had sacrificed their lives for the nation and the citizens owed the freedom they enjoy to those veterans. Referring to the Tamil Nadu’s contribution to the Indian Armed Forces (IAF) he said the state has over 4.5 lakh ex-servicemen. 
 
 “The ex-servicemen are the major foundation of the Army and they are the ones who created a strong basement for the force. We, the new generation, are taking the foundation to the next level,” Hariz said.
