VISAKHAPATNAM: Farmers should be treated as marginalised community members, said professor  , vice-chancellor of  , here on Monday. 

 Speaking at a seminar on ‘Farmers’ Suicides and Marginalised Communities’ at the Social Exclusion, Inclusion and Policy Study Centre on World Justice Day, the VC said farmers have now become daily wage earners and are leasing or selling lands to find work in the urban belt. At this rate, by 2030 there would be very few farmers left and food security in India would become a major issue, he said.
 
 The VC in his address said the government must engineer another green revolution to ensure food security for the masses and financial security for farmers. 
 
 Professor  , principal of Arts College, Andhra University, said India would face huge food security crisis in the next decade unless there was a fundamental policy change to empower farmers.
