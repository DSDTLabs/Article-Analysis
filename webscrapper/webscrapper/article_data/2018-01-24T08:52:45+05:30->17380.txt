 She is also being a good parent to her two children and looking after their needs. Rubina started as a   but her husband thought she’d be better off in business. “So he helped me open this boutique, which today is a big support to us when he is not there,” she said. The former law-school topper lives with her in-laws who disowned her after her husband’s death. “Because of property issues,” she said, “but I insisted on staying with them to not alienate my children from their grandparents.”
 
 Local MP   suggested her to separate from in-laws so that the children don’t grow into bitter human beings because of the estranged behaviour of their grandparents. She told Rubina that even though she was trying hard to win the respect of her late husband’s family, it was not doing her children any good to face constant discrimination and alienation.”
 
 Rubina, who is fond of dress-designing, said her in-laws objected to her partying and socialising with friends after the death of her husband. She said: “This mindset should change so that women can move on after a loss and don’t become  .” “Society should not judge a woman by her hairstyle or clothes, as it doesn’t judge even the weirdest-dressed men,” the MP said.
