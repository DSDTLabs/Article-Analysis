 “We have taken up a field inspection to identify the spots where drainage is being let into the canal. We would prepare a report and submit it to the district administration for actions," said environmentalist and Thanneer member K C Neelamegam. 
 
 Meanwhile, around 75 people cleared weeds and plastic waste on the canal’s banks as part of the cleanliness drive launched by the Citizen for Uyyakondan.
