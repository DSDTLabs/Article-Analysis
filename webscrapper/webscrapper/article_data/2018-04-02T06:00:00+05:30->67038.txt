We saw the students of   College of Architecture enjoying some light-hearted moments, filled with fun and banter at a get-together organised recently.

 They sang, danced and generally let their hair down, with seniors and juniors coming together to beat the stress.
 
 Fun pictures, selfies and photo shoots were all a part of this 'do.'
