COLVA: In the last couple of weeks, the   (GVP) seems to be having a windfall of prospective candidates wanting to contest under its banner. 

 At the moment GVP has given tickets to six candidates: Nelly Rodrigues (Cortalim), George Baretto (Navelim), John Monteiro (Cuncolim), Maria Rebello (Benaulim), Joseph D’Silva (Fatorda) and   (Pernem).
 
 Incidentally, most of these candidates, who have developed a sudden attraction for the party, are those who did not find favour with national parties.
 
 For Rodrigues it is a ‘ghar wapasi’. She had abandoned the GVP and joined the Nationalist   (NCP) hoping to be a Congress-NCP candidate, but sensing that all was not hunky-dory between both parties, she returned to the GVP. 
 
 Baretto was an aspirant for the NCP ticket in Navelim, while Monteiro and D’Silva were hoping for the   ticket from Cuncolim and Fatorda, respectively. As D’Silva filed two nominations, his form didn’t find favour with the ECI. Rebello first tried her luck with AAP, then with the Congress, and was finally allotted a ticket by GVP. 
 
 In fact, in July 2016, then GVP supremo Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco had told TOI that Rebello was the GVP candidate for Benaulim, though she kept denying it.
 
 GVP president  , when asked the reason for allotting tickets to individuals who were initially aspiring to contest the polls on a national party ticket, said his candidates had realized their folly and decided to put their energy in building a strong regional party. 
 
 Reminded about his alleged closeness to defence minister Manohar Parrikar and claims of him fielding candidates who will prove beneficial to the BJP, Monteiro said his party has pitted candidates against the BJP in Cortalim and Pernem, while it is taking on other national parties in other constituencies. 
 
 The party has fielded candidates from constituencies where it has a strong support base, Monteiro added.
