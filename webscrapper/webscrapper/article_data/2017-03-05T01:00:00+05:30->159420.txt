BHAGALPUR: The court of ADJ   will decide on March 7 on the anticipatory bail petition filed by JD(U) MLA (suspended) and former   (BAU) vice-chancellor Mewalal Choudhary. 

 An FIR has been lodged with Sabour police station against Choudhary for his role in alleged irregularities in the appointment of 162 assistant professors/junior scientists during his tenure as BAU VC in 2012. 
 
 The police on Saturday submitted the case diary during the hearing on Choudhary’s bail petition on Saturday. Public prosecutor Satyanarayan Prasad Sah requested the court to deny the anticipatory bail to the former BAU VC. Pleading for Choudhary’s bail, Patna high court advocate Abhay Kumar Singh denied the charges made against his client and pleaded his innocence.
 
 The former VC is an accused in the case (number 35/17) lodged against him by the BAU registrar on February 21, 2017. He has been charged under sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) on the basis of the report submitted by Justice (retd) Syed Mohammed Mahfooz Alam, who probed the allegations of irregularities in the BAU appointments.
 
 The probe was conducted after the chancellor’s nod and the allegations were found to be true. Many of the appointments were made by allegedly ignoring merit (written scores and academics) whereas the screening committee awarded high marks to the selected applicants in interview and PowerPoint presentation (PPT). 
 
 Sources said BAU was instructed by the chancellor’s office to initiate action against Choudhary after the probe committee found the allegations true against him.
