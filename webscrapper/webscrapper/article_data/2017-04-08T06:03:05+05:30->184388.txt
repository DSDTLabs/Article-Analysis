BENGALURU: This   when most cricket-loving Bengalureans will either be glued to their TV screens or crowd the  , cops will be out to get a piece of the action. They will be showing messages and, probably, videos of their latest digital campaigns on women's safety and traffic awareness at the stadium. 

  From the large screen showing the match to the LED screens by the boundaries, the stadium is full of opportunities, say cops. Although so far police haven't got any slots during the match, they hope to send their message across before or after the games. 
 
   , police commissioner, said the proposal was made during several meetings between cops and organizers on security arrangements, to which they obliged. "Apart from the LED screens at the stadium, there are several screens outside too; we thought our campaign could have a bigger reach," he said. 
 
  Bengaluru police have been running campaigns on women's safety, traffic awareness and citizen empowerment on the social media platform. Recently, a series of videos on drink-and-drive and towing of vehicles was released. Instead of making generic statements, the videos will address the issues directly, said police. 
 
  The first set of ads will be rolled out during the match between Delhi Daredevils and   Bengaluru on Saturday. This will continue for the rest of season too. 
 
  Meanwhile, final security arrangements for the up coming matches were put in place on Friday. According to police, most of the arrangements are the same as last edition. However, based on a recent recommendation from the internal security division, the perimeter wall of the stadium has been barb-wired.
