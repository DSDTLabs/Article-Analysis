VISAKHAPATNAM: Several girl students and working women had a close shave after a fire broke out at the hostel near   in the wee hours of Saturday.

 Hostel inmates ran for their lives in the middle of the night after the fire broke out. A short circuit is suspected to be the reason for the fire. Around 54 inmates of the hostel said they lost their certificates, clothes and other valuables in the blaze.
 
 The fire broke out at Safe Hands Ladies Hostel near Meghalaya Hotel. According to sources, the fire mishap occurred after a short circuit from a fan spread through the hostel. There was no firefighting equipment at the hostel, inmates alleged. Fire safety norms were not adhered to, sources said, pointing to the wooden partitioning of the huge hall on the fifth floor to create 10 rooms. Each room had 10 inmates, and the management was charging Rs 5,000 from each person.
 
 “We cried for help and shouted for the main switch to be turned off but nobody responded. We tried to inform the management over phone but there was no response. At the time of the incident, there were two male cooks on the premises but neither knew where the main switchboard was,” said Lakshmi, an inmate.
 
 The inmates later staged a protest outside the hostel alleging that the negligence of the management cost them their certificates and other belongings. 
 
 They demanded the district administration to take action against the   for negligence.
