Her choice of unconventional roles and her acting chops have won   a lot of critical acclaim. But not many know that she is extremely conscious about social issues, too. 

 The actress strongly believes in environmental conservation and works towards it in every way possible. So, when she recently moved into a new home in the Western suburbs of Mumbai, Richa decided to grow her own organic kitchen garden. She handpicked plants from across the city and even got the seeds of some crops flown in from Los Angeles.
 
 Excited about her latest hobby, the actress says, “Growing your own food ensures that it is pesticide-free and organic. It does not harm the environment in any way.”
