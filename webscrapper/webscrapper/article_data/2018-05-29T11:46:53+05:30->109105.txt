JAIPUR: Mine   affected with the incurable silicosis sat in   in Jodhpur on Monday, demanding representation in the  . While the trust rules provide for representation of members from the association of mine owners, two workers are nominated to it by the government. The workers, in a written submission to the district collector, demanded that five people who are representatives of trade unions of workers, be included. The collector met the people on protest.

 Collector   told TOI, “Jodhpur is the district which has offered the maximum number of silicosis patients and their kin compensation. At the meeting today, issues of delay in compensation payments were discussed. We will, over the next two weeks, see what procedural aberrations need correction. We will also request the state government for better budgetary support, if that is needed.”
 
 The state government, through a notification of May 3, has hiked compensation to those diagnosed with silicosis and registered as construction and building workers to Rs 2 lakh, from the current Rs 1 lakh. Since 2013, the state has been offering Rs 1 lakh to patients; kin of patients who die get Rs 3 lakh. Mine workers have demanded that this notification should also extend to those contracting the disease in mines.
 
 Workers also expressed dismay that they had to face a hurdle of documentation each time they attempt to access compensation – they are told to bring certificates to show that they are indeed mine workers, for instance. This is hard to establish, since workers shift jobs often and mine workers do not certify that silicosis patients have worked for them. Workers said once a qualified doctor has certified a patient, the money should be released without harassment. The District Mineral Foundation Trusts were formed in 2015, after an amendment of the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957. These trusts are meant to work for the benefit of people and areas affected by mining operations.
