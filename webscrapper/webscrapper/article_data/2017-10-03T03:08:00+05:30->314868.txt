Margao: The Shadow Council for Margao has criticized the Margao Municipal Council (MMC) for its “lack of seriousness” in implementing the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan mission. Commenting on the MMC’s walkathon and cycle rally held on Monday, the group expressed disappointment over poor participation by MMC councillors. Only 5 out of 25 councillors participated.  “It appears the MMC is looking out for opportunities to exhaust funds allocated under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Madgaonkars want to know when the collection of segregated waste will start. We do not subscribe to wasteful expenditure on publicity stunts,” group convener, Savio Coutinho, said. tnn
