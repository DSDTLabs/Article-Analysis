Marathi girl   was in Bengaluru recently for her recent Telugu film’s promotions. She recalled how this felt like homecoming for her because of two reasons. “We shot at a housing society here, where a major chunk of the film’s shoot was held at. While the film is set in Hyderabad, this apartment complex was apt for what we wanted to show in the film. The people here are very sweet and cooperative. It was a smooth schedule and we enjoyed every bit of the time out on the set,” says Surbhi.
She regrets that she could not explore more of the city. “We had back-to-back shooting schedules that gave little time for us to explore the city. An interesting fact is that I had lived in Bengaluru as a toddler, when I was two or three years old. My mother tried reminding me of different things I’d done in the city back then, like visiting the zoo here and more,” adds Surbhi.
 The Maharashtrian girl, who has acted in quite a few Telugu and Tamil   now, says that she is comfortable with the languages and the people here. “It is a challenge to move across different spaces and interpret languages and emotions for films. I’m enjoying my stint in the film industry here. I have received   film offers too, though I would want to weigh my options and choose the right film if I do want to enter the film industry,” says Surbhi.
