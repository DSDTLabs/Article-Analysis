PANAJI: The Goa Forward Party (GFP) had struck a deal with BJP over the statue of Dr Jack Sequeira, alleged   committee (AICC) secretary Girish Chodankar. “The GFP has sold the statue of Dr   for one chairmanship (of Greater   PDA) and passage of four files,” said Chodankar, adding that the deal was struck barely a month after it promised to get the statue installed at the Assembly complex. 

 Former Santa Cruz MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate, who joined GFP ahead of the Panaji by-election last year, is all set to be appointed as the chairman of the Greater Panaji Planning and Development Authority.
 
 Referring to the decision of the   speaker Pramod Sawant not to take up resolutions on the issue of statues during the upcoming budget session, Chodankar said, “The sense of the house is out and loud, that they (a majority of the MLAs) want the statue of Dr Jack Sequeira. The speaker should have considered it,” he said, pointing out that 21 MLAs, including one from the BJP, have stated that they want the statue to be installed. When asked whether a breach of privilege will be brought against the speaker, Chodankar said the party will have to check with constitutional experts. 
 
 Calling the Greater Panaji PDA an “attempt to scam” , Chodankar urged the chief minister to stop “the sham”.
