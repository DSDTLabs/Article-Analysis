BENGALURU: A quick-thinking driver succeeded in saving the lives of 32 passengers when the Airavat club-class bus operated by the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation caught fire on Wednesday night.

 The bus (bearing registration KA-57-F-212) was on the way to Hyderabad when fire broke out around 10.30pm near the engine in the rear compartment of the bus.
 
 Driver Vijay Kumar RN told TOI: “Everything in the bus looked normal when we left Shantinagar terminus. After the bus crossed the   interchange and neared Devanahalli, there was a loud noise from the rear of the vehicle. Not wanting to take chances, I pulled over.”
 
 Kumar got off the vehicle and inspected the engine. He was shocked to see fire in the compartment. “I knew I had very little time. Several passengers, including a few senior citizens and women, had dozed off and I had to get them out of the bus safe before something went horribly wrong,” he said.
 
 
 
 
 The passengers got off and gathered at a distance from the bus. Just as the fire started spreading, the crew and a few passengers pulled out passengers’ luggage from the bus.
 
 By then, some passengers had called the police control room and the fire service personnel. Preliminary investigations said the diesel pipe connecting to the engine had got snapped, resulting in the fire. KSRTC officials lauded Kumar, with 12 years of experience at the wheel, for his presence of mind and swift action. “If he had continued to drive without stopping to check what was causing the noise, there could have been a tragedy,” an official said.
