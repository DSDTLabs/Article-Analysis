CHANDIGARH: Women riding two-wheelers in the city will soon have to wear  . 

 Following directions from the Punjab and   high court, the UT administration on Tuesday made an amendment in the Chandigarh Motor Vehicle Rules, 1990, paving way for helmets becoming compulsory for women. At present, wearing helmet is optional for women riders. Sikh women have been exempted on religious grounds.
 
 The decision was taken after considering the aspect of safety of women, including that of Sikh women who are not wearing turban, particularly in view of the fatalities occurring in accidents.
 
 The words, "a Sikh woman wearing a turban", instead of words, "or a Woman", have been proposed to be substituted in Rule 193 of the Chandigarh Motor Vehicle Rules. The administration has invited objection from public before issuing a formal notification.
 
 In recent years, there has been a rise in number of women on two-wheelers losing their lives. In 2017, a total of 18 women were killed in road accidents, while 68 sustained injuries. According to data, around 43% people killed in road accidents were two-wheeler riders.
