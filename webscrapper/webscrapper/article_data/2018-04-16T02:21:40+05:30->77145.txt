NEW DELHI: Finding your coach or the nearest amenity at the   is set to get a lot easier, with Northern Railways introducing seven new Rail-Yatra kiosks over the next two months.

 The kiosks will act as self-help desks for passengers. The touch-screen based system provides a host of features, which include finding the shortest route to your coach and train, locating amenities at the railway station and ideal travel modes and routes out of the railway station.
 
 Aimed at reducing queues at help desks and providing easier ways for passengers to acquire information, Northern Railways carried out a pilot test over the last two months and officials said the response has been very good. “Passengers who tried the service said it is extremely helpful for them and based on this response, we will be introducing seven more such machines by the end of May,” said a senior official.
 
 The first such   was installed on January 26 as a part of Republic day celebrations at New Delhi railway station. The kiosks are now part of the recent action plan to upgrade the station. Officials said each platform is likely to have one such kiosk as a number of passengers just want to enquire about their   status. The system has a 40-inch display screen with a 3D digitised map of the railway station as well.
 
 The railway station has undergone a revamp already over the last few months, which includes a new colour scheme, the introduction of wall paintings and new interiors in waiting rooms.
