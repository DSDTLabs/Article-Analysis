NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has sent to LG Anil Baijal a file pertaining to reduction in fares of   and cluster buses by 75% for approval.

 Last month, Baijal's predecessor   had suggested the AAP government to reduce fares of DTC and cluster buses for one month to encourage people to use public transport and shun use of private vehicles in a bid to bring down the rising air pollution in the capital.
 
 “We have sent the file to LG for his approval. We hope that LG will give his nod in a day or two,“ transport minister   said. As per the proposal, there will be a flat fare of Rs 5 in all non-air-conditioned DTC and cluster buses and Rs 10 in all air-conditioned buses for a month. This is being done on a trial basis. At present, a ride in an AC bus can cost anywhere between Rs 10 to 25 while in non-AC buses Rs 5 to Rs 15.
 
 Sources said, some officers had raised objections, saying the move may cause financial loss to the DTC. A senior government official said DTC is already incurring losses, and reduction in fares will not have a big impact on its financial condition.
