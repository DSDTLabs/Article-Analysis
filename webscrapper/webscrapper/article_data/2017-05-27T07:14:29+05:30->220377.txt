COIMBATORE: A day after alleging discriminations on the campus of   Centre for Ornithology and Natural History (Sacon) at Anaikatti in Coimbatore district, doctoral student from Kashmir on Friday wrote to the ministries of human resource development and forests, environment and climate change and the Prime Minister's office seeking inquiry into the matter.

 The student, Mohammed   Malik, has already written to   and Kashmir government and the hu man rights commission about the incident.
 
 Stating that he had hostel records and email-communication, Zeeshan said he was targeted and mentally tortured during his one month's stay when he visited Sacon for his viva voce.
 
 “I personally went to the offices in New Delhi and have submitted my letter to the secretaries of the ministers. I am hopeful that required action would be taken,“ said Zeeshan. The 27-year-old said he was extremely proud of his achievements at Sacon but would never come back there after this incident.
 
 “I am aware of the happenings in my state and I thought I was away from all the problems. I had a really good stay until this last one month. I did not take this up because I wanted to gain mileage or prove anything,“ he said.
