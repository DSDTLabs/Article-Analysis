SHRAVANABELAGOLA: Prime Minister   on Monday said India is a great country, where sages and seers not only involve themselves in spiritual service, but also initiate various social services for the people.

 Inaugurating the newly carved 630 steps at   hill and   at the 88th   Mahotsav 2018 here, Modi said that a majority of people in the country think that saints and seers are only involved in religious programmes, but their perception is not correct. “The saints, munis, bhagwans, acharyas and seers also work for the welfare of the people. They are filling the empty stomachs of poor people who come to them. They are also doing social service like providing education and health services to the poor and rehabilitating people who are addicted to drugs,” he said.
 
 Modi said the Centre decided to construct the steps to the hill despite the Archaeology Survey of India (ASI) laying down restrictions on it. Shravanabelagola mutt seer Charukeerthi Bhattaraka swamiji said: “Modi’s mother has given him sanskar, like Chamundaraya was by his mother. He knows the culture and tradition of India. PM Modi’s name will be carved in golden letters like Chandra Gupta, Bahubali, Chamundaraya and Mysuru Wadiyars for their work for society,” he said. The PM thanked the swami for referring to his mother Hiraba in his speech. After the inauguration, the swami felicitated Modi with a caradamom garland, a silver kalasha and two books on Lord   and a Bahubali idol.
 
 The swami also gave prasadam of Mahamastakabishekha and presented an idol of Lord Bahubali standing on Vindhyagiri hill to Modi, with a request to give it to his mother.
