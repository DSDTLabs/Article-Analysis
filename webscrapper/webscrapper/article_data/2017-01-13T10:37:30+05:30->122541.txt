INDORE: A quick-fire knock of 44 by teenage prodigy  , who served another sample of his exceptional talent, and a highly-debatable negative bowling strategy by Gujarat, in an attempt to seal this game on the first innings lead basis, has allowed Mumbai to come back into the game at the halfway stage of the   here at the Holkar Cricket Stadium.

 After they began the morning of Day Three on a perfect note by wrapping up the remaining four Gujarat wickets for 37 runs in the opening session, the defending champions were still under pressure as they had a first innings deficit of 100. A questionable plan by Gujarat, which could come back to bite them later in the game, though, saw Mumbai get to 208 for 3 at stumps which gives them a lead of 108 with seven wickets in the bag.
 
 It was the young Shaw, who gave wings to Mumbai's dreams of staging a comeback, crashing eight exquisite fours while racing to 44 off 35 balls. Stroking the ball hard through the covers and mid-wicket region, Shaw batted in fifth gear to help Mumbai shave off some part of the lead in quick time. However, once the 17-year-old departed to a poor stroke, Gujarat, fearing a further assault from the likes of   and  , resorted to an inexplicable game plan by bowling wide outside off-stump.
 
 All the seamers started bowling on the sixth and seventh stump on the off-side. Later, their left-arm spinner, Hardik Patel, too stuck to the plan by bowling over the wicket, outside leg-stump. While this plan did stop the bleeding of runs, it couldn't stop Iyer as he made amends for his first innings failure by scoring a reasonably fluent 82 (137b, 9x4, 2x6). Iyer was eventually out, trying to cut Gaja. His 127-run stand for the third wicket with Yadav consumed 279 balls, but it provided the stability that the innings needed before Mumbai can go for the leather on Friday.
