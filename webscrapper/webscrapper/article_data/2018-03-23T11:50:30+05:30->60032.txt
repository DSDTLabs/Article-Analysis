CHANDIGARH: The   bench of   (CAT) has imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on an assistant professor of Government College of Art, Sector 10, for filing a 'wrong contempt application'. 

 Dr   had filed the application in a matter in which he was not even a party.
 
 The order stated that A K Sharma had, in the past, challenged multiple appointments of acting principals of the college. One such matter is still pending with CAT. The case in which Sharma has been fined is titled '  vs union of India and others'. Sharma, however, filed a contempt petition in this case for non-compliance with an order. The order further reads, "Not only that, the applicant has also wrongly sought action against the respondents, under the provisions of Contempt of Courts Act". It further reads, "No direction, of any kind, was issued which the respondents were required to comply with." CAT observed that Sharma has filed this 'frivolous petition', in order to exert pressure on the respondents, to achieve his evil designs without any cause of action accruing to him.
 
 The order has also pointed out, "As illogical as it may seem, but strictly speaking, the tendency and frequency of persons (like the petitioner) for filing frivolous contempt petitions, with an eye to put undue pressure on the officers of the State, has been tremendously increasing day by day, which needs to be curbed at the right earnest." The tribunal thus imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Sharma, which he will pay to the UT legal services authority. If he fails to do so, the pay disbursing authority is further directed to deduct the amount from Sharma's salary for the month of April, 2018.
