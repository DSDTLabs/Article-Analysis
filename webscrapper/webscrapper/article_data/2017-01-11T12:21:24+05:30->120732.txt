  , wife of former Goa governor  , on Tuesday pointed to authorities’ ‘inaction’ despite repeated complaints over alleged attempts to grab her ancestral beach-side property in South Goa for being compelled to seek Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assistance in the matter.
 
  Fazal, in her letter addressed to PM Modi in October 2015, had sought his assistance in building a centre of spirituality, ayurveda and yoga, besides an allied facility for senior citizens at her ancestral property spread over 55,000 sq m in Sernabatim, Colva. The letter also mentioned about attempts to usurp and grab the property by “crafty manipulation of the judiciary officials, mamlatdar officials as well as the collector of South Goa district”.
  
  She had further sought the PM’s help as she was “being repeatedly targetted, harassed, intimidated, abused, and to the extent that death threats have been openly issued by a hooligan.” She had also mentioned that she was being stalked and closely monitored, her personal phone SIM had been tapped, and her emails were being illegally monitored and accesed.
  
  “No amount of complaints to the superintendent of police, South Goa, or the DGP is able to stop the spate of surreptitious harassments that I am being made to face,” her letter had also stated.
  
  Documents produced by her before the media revealed that action was initiated into her complaints, following directions from the PM’s office to the state’s then chief secretary.
