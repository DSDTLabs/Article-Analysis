CHANDIGARH: The special investigation team (SIT) of   received a rap on the knuckles from the   and   high court on Friday for allegedly "conniving" with the accused involved in the leak of paper for the Haryana judicial services selection examination. HC was upset over the manner in which the SIT had shared the statements of witnesses recorded under the Section 164 of CrPC with the accused on directions of trial court, without filing any appeal against such orders before the high court. 

 "What was the purpose of constituting SIT if you have to work in such casual manner? Why you handed over the statements of the witnesses to the accused in compliance of the trial court order without availing the right to challenge it to the high court? What was the pressure," a full bench of the HC questioned the Chandigarh police. 
 
 The bench headed by Justice   also went to observe that what was left in the trial now, if all statements recorded under Section 164 of CrPC had been handed over to the accused.
 
 "It appears you are also involved in it. Your connivance has been proved that without challenging the order you supplied the copies of the statements to the accused. Difficult to digest that you were under so much pressure that statements were handed over to the accused," observed the bench questioning SIT's role. HC also expressed surprised as to why the prosecution of the case is not handled by an officer of the level of district attorney before the trial court.
