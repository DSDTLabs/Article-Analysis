HYDERABAD: Yadava and   associations of Telangana are gearing up to unleash a massive show of strength at Gymkhana Grounds in Secunderabad on April 29, which may be the perfect platform for the expansion of the Federal Front plans of TRS supremo and chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. Efforts are on to invite national leaders from various political parties, particularly from Yadava and Kurma communities.

 Top-rung leaders in the probable invite list include   satraps and former Uttar Pradesh chief ministers   and   and Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah, who hails from the Kurma community.
 
 Yadava and Kurma leaders said they would shortly meet the chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and take a final decision on inviting national level leaders to the mega event.
 
 “It is a meeting to express gratitude to chief minister KCR for coming out with multiple schemes and sops for Yadavas and Kurmas, right from the Rs 5,000 crore sheep distribution programme to giving a Rajya Sabha seat and promising an MLC seat to a community member. The chief minister has allotted 10 acres in   for Yadav Kurma Bhavan and also sanctioned funds for its construction. In last 60 years, no leader or political party implemented so many welfare measures. Meat processing units for Yadavs and Kurmas in urban areas are also on the anvil,” said a leader of the association.
 
 Telangana Yadava officials and   state president   confirmed to STOI they are planning to mobilise over 10 lakh people to the meeting under the leadership of animal husbandry minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav.
 
 “It is a collective effort and state minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav is monitoring preparations. The associations from two communities have already begun work to make the meeting a grand success. They are touring every district and mandal headquarters. There are over 50 lakh Yadavas and Kurmas in Telangana,” said Krishna Yadav.
