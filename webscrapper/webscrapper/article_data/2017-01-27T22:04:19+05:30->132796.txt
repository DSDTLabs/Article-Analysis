PANAJI: Congress leader   on Friday criticised defence minister   and said that Parrikar's performance in the defence ministry was under question. 

 "I don't think he has lived up to the stature of the defence minister," Pilot said. Pilot went on to say that the Modi-government had gone back on the commitment given to ex-servicemen on OROP.
 
 "I am sorry to say but as defence minister his performance has certainly been under question. I don't think there has been any defence minister in the past who has been so disinterested in his job," Pilot said while responding to a question.
 
 On January 26, union minister   said that Parrikar was a gift from Goa to the nation. Pilot picked up on Irani's statement and then asked why the party appeared happy to return Parrikar to state politics.
 
 Union ministry of shipping, road, transport and highways   earlier in January hinted that Parrikar could be the next chief minister of Goa.
 
 "As far as being a gift to government of India, I think Parrikar is more of a return gift, if we go by what Gadkari said," Pilot said.
