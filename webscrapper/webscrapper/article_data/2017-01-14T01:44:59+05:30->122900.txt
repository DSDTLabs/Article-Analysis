NOIDA: A   diversion to facilitate construction of an underpass will slow down commuters going from Noida and Greater Noida towards Delhi via  .

 The traffic police have therefore urged all commuters to avoid the Mahamaya flyover-Kalindi Kunj route for six to seven months because of the ongoing construction work on the route by the Noida Authority.
 
 An underpass is being constructed on the route to connect to sectors 94, 95, 125 with the Master Plan III road so as to decongest the Mahamaya flyover.
 
 An advisory on Noida traffic police’s Twitter and   pages says, “Traffic going towards Delhi from Noida has been diverted to a slip road on the Mahamaya flyover-Kalindi Kunj route. Heavy vehicles, in particular, are requested to use the DND flyway to go to Delhi as traffic is slow on the Mahamaya route.”
 
 According to the traffic police, because of the construction work, the Shahdara bridge carriageway has been rendered narrower for the traffic coming from Greater Noida and Noida, which merges at the stretch.
 
 The underpass, which will link sectors 94, 95, 125, etc with the Master Plan III road, aims to decongest the stretch between Kalindi Kunj in Delhi and NH-24 and make it signal-free.
 
 The Rs 40-crore project was delayed by nearly one and a half years because of a stay on construction from the Allahabad high court. The construction has been restarted after the Noida Authority got the stay vacated recently.
 
 Traffic inspector   told TOI that traffic from as many as 11 lanes coming from three different directions merges at the 60-metre-long   road.
