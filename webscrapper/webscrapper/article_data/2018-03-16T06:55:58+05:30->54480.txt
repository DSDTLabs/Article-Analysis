AHMEDABAD:   has said that   for the poor is welcome, but they must ensure that the   where they perform surgeries   and it is their duty to take   because beneficiaries of such service are mainly poor people.

 The high court has also suggested that the government should “at the earliest and very seriously”form guidelines for holding eye-camps to ensure the protection of patients who are generally drawn from the poorer and less affluent section of society.”
 
 The high court observed so while dealing with a case in which two ophthalmologists were charged with medical negligence while performing cataract extraction surgeries at Sri Ravishankar Maharaj Hospital in Chikhodara village near Anand in 2012. Ten patients lost vision in the eyes operated upon due to infection during post-operative care. The patients had lodged an FIR against the doctors.
 
 Justice J B Pardiwala quashed the FIR on the ground that there was no issue with the surgery, but they were not present when the patients came next day for post-operative care. Hence, criminal liability cannot be fastened on them, the judge said while citing catena of judgments in this regard.
 
 The HC noticed that 5.1 million people underwent cataract surgery every year in India and the chance of failure is 0.04% to 0.041%. However, with a projected steep rise in such surgeries, minimizing the rate of endophthalmitis is important.
 
 Justice Pardiwala said the medical profession is a noble profession and it is extremely difficult to define an act of gross negligence by a trained doctor. But for charitable trusts holding camps for poor patients and for doctors providing voluntary service, the judge had a word of caution. “Howsoever laudable the aim of the hospital is, it proved disastrous medical misadventure for patients hailing from poor strata of society. Why this indifferent treatment towards such a class of society?” the court asked and said that the disaster took place due to lack of post-operative care.
