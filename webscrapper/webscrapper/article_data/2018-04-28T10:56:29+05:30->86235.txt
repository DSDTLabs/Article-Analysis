  : Doctors at the city's   and Hospital are yet to note natural flow of blood into the brain of the six-year-old who was raped in   and who continues to battle for life, seven days after the incident. 

 The child, who is on ventilator support, continues to be critical, said hospital staff. There has been little improvement. "We are yet to witness natural flow of oxygen to her brain even after seven days of continuous ventilator support, which is a major cause of concern," said Dr Bhuban  , senior surgeon and co-ordinator of the 13-member team formed for the treatment of the survivor.
 
 The team conducted a meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the condition of the girl. Detailed examination of all the reports, including that of her ECG, blood pressure and several other parameters, were conducted. 
 
 "As her condition is not improving we may go for a surgical intervention," said Moharana, who added there was no improvement in the comatose state the child was in.
 
 The survivor has been on ventilator support since Saturday night, when she was admitted to the hospital after being rescued in an unconscious state from a school verandah of   village.
