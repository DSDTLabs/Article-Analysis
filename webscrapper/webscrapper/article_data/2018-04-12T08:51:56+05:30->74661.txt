NEW DELHI:   believes he has seen enough in England allrounder   to suggest that he can fill the void left by Mitchell Starc’s absence. 

 
 
 
 Writing in today’s TOI, the South African legend, who is head coach of  , expressed confidence in Curran’s abilities. 
 
 “It was a blow to lose   at short notice but we are not alone - Pat Cummins and Kagiso Rabada were also ‘casualties’ of a hard-fought Test series between South Africa and Australia.
 
 
 
 But Tom Curran is an excellent replacement and I’m excited to have him on board. Obviously he has particular skills for bowling at the end of the innings, but he can bowl anywhere, and I would be surprised if his batting doesn’t make a few important contributions along the way,” wrote Kallis, who in 70 matches for   scored 1603 runs and took 48 wickets. 
 
 Curran, 23, was confirmed as Starc’s replacement last week having been overlooked during the player auction in January. This is his first stint with an   franchise, and he made his debut in KKR’s second match at the expense of Mitchell Johnson, taking 2/39 in three overs in a last-over defeat to Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday. 
 
 Captained by Dinesh Karthik this season, KKR have won one and lost one. The look of the squad is significantly different from the one that lifted two IPL titles, and Kallis singled out Karthik for his skill as leader in a new set-up. 
 
 “The Knight Riders franchise is known for its stability and its success has been underpinned by a core group of senior and familiar faces but, like all successful teams, KKR has been able to change and grow into the future. Lots of time was spent in the week or ten days before the first game helping the new players to settle in and find their feet within the KKR family. Dinesh Karthik has played a double role – both as captain and a new player himself – and, as expected, has been excellent,” wrote the 42-year-old.
