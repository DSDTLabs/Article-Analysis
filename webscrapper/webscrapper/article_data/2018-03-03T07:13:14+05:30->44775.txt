PUNE: The civic administration’s plan to introduce night-time   fees hangs in the balance as some elected members of the standing committee are opposed to the idea and have postponed a call on it. 

 The   (PMC) had planned a new policy, according to which people were supposed to pay charges for parking vehicles in front of their houses. 
 
 The proposal, tabled before the committee, states that the rates have been defined on the basis of the demand for parking space in a particular area. Following a six-month survey, the areas were categorized as ‘Zone A’ (less demand), ‘Zone B’ (good demand) and ‘Zone C’ (very high demand). 
 
 “A group of elected members is against the move (of introducing night-time parking charges). Some of them are from the ruling party. They fear that the move might irk a large number of commuters, who are their voters. The decision on the proposal is pending,” a source in the committee said.
 
 The citizens, according to the policy, will have to pay charges to parking the vehicles between 10pm and 8am. If the proposal is cleared, parking a car in the city areas will cost Rs 18,250 per year (Rs 50 per night). Besides, one has to shell out Rs 9,125 (Rs 25 per night) for parking a car near old buildings and wadas and Rs 4,562 (Rs 12.50 per night) near slum areas.
 
 The proposal was tabled before the committee in February. But there has not been any movement as the committee decided to not take a call on the proposal. A meeting of the committee scheduled in the recent past was also cancelled as its members, including the chairman, had gone to Mumbai to attend a meeting on the Shivsrushti project.
 
 BJP city chief   has hinted that his party was not in favour of increasing the charges. “Asking the citizens to pay heavy parking fees is not justifiable, when the city does not have adequate public transport. Our party is against such hefty charges,” he said.
