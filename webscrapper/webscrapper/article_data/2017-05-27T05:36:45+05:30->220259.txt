MUMBAI/  : In what is being touted as a remarkable comeback, the Congress won the   on its own steam, snapping up 47 of the 90 seats. Earlier, it had to team up with allies to control the House.

 The demonetisation move made the BJP unpopular in Bhiwandi, locals said. Known as a powerloom town, Bhiwandi survives chiefly on hard cash and it was in woefully short supply over the last six months. This, they believe, helped the Congress make a big dent.
 
 The BJP may not have won, but it made surprise gains, upping its tally of nine seats in 2012 to 19. Konark Vikas Aghadi, the BJP's ally , won 4 seats, taking the saffron tally to 23 in a Muslim-dominated city.
 
 The NCP and   suffered shocking setbacks. The NCP had won nine seats in 2012. This time around, it failed to open its account. The Samajwadi Party could retain only two of the 16 seats it had won in 2012.
 
 “The Muslim community chose the Congress over other parties such as the NCP, the MIM and the Samajwadi Party. On the other hand, the Hindu votes got badly polarised.This led to our defeat. We will have to do some fresh thinking,“ said BJP MP Kapil Patil. A party functionary blamed Patil's arbitrary interference while distributing party tickets for the BJP's poor showing.
 
 The Shiv Sena, which had won 16 seats in the last election, managed to bag only 12.Sudrabee Khan is its lone Muslim representative in the new civic body .
