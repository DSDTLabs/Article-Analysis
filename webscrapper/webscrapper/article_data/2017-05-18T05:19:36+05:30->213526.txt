NEW DELHI:   ( ) is likely to introduce a two-year Masters of Business Administration (MBA) postgraduate degree programme from this year. The course, which is currently pending approval by the university, is expected to have a profile similar to MBA programmes offered by IIMs. The college is expected to offer 65 seats. 

 SRCC will not require approval from   for this course as it will be funded by the college itself. 
 
 Divided into four semesters, the programme will offer 18 additional courses. “The new course will replace the existing two-year postgraduate   (GBO) diploma programme,” said RP Rustagi, officiating principal of SRCC. “We are waiting for the MBA programme to be approved by the university,” he added. 
 
 The admission procedure for GBO diploma differs from the rest of the courses at the college as its registration process for the 2017-19 batch was conducted in January this year.
 
 Although the MBA degree programme is said to be an upgrade to the existing GBO diploma, its curriculum will be entirely different. It is expected to offer the same subjects and electives as IIMs. 
 
 Currently, out of the five courses at SRCC, GBO is the only diploma programme. “We are looking forward to replacing the existing twoyear diploma course with a degree programme. Students will then have the advantage of getting a postgraduate degree rather than a diploma," said a member of the college administration.
