PANAJI: NGO   has demanded that the government roll back the registration fee hike at   and district hospitals, and supply certain food items at subsidised rates through the public distribution system 

 In a press note, the women’s collective stated that, every year, on March 8, International Women’s Day, they raise several demands. However, these have financial implications and they do not get addressed, as no budgetary allocations are made,   of Bailancho Saad said.
 
 With a request to provide on priority basis in this year’s budget, the NGO demanded that registration fees raised from Rs 20 to Rs 100 at   and to Rs 50 at some other government hospitals in the state, be rolled back.
 
 Martins said that over a period most food items and fuel like kerosene were removed from the ration card making it extremely difficult for poor to survive.
 
 The NGO has demanded that the domestic LPG gas cylinders and power be subsidised. Among the NGO’s other demands were free transport for students of classes 11 and above, more buses/alternative modes of transport to ease overcrowding to prevent sexual harassment, research grant for teachers.
