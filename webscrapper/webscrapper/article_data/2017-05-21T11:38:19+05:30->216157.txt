CHENNAI: Less than a year after the Madras high court directed TN Dr   to re-evaluate the answer scripts of a batch of PG   who moved the court, the university is planning to move the evaluation of answer sheets for all medical, dental and paramedical courses online.As a pilot project, bar-coded answer sheets of 500 postgraduate dental and super-speciality students were evaluated online by examiners earlier this year. "Initially, it does take time for the examiners to get used to evaluating sheets on a large desktop screen, but the system reduces manual error. If the teacher skips an answer or scrolls too fast, the machine will give an alert. It is programmed to ask the evaluator if he is sure when the student fails or is awarded zero for an answer," said university registrar  .

 According to the plan, students will be given customised 73-page barcoded answer sheets tagged to their roll numbers. Once a student submits the answer sheets, it is sent to a high-speed scanner and images will be loaded on to a university server. Examiners will then evaluate the scanned images on desktops connected through intranet.The evaluator will have access to the answer key. "In manual corrections, there is always a risk of prejudice," he said. In case there is a difference in scores, the highest score will be awarded to the students.
 
 "We are now discussing what we should do if the difference is 30% marks or more. While one group of officials thinks it should go to a third evaluator, another feels an average should be taken," Dr Balasubramanian said.
