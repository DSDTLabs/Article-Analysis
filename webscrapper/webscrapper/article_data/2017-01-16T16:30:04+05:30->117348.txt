 Review: The music of Gautamiputra Satakarni, by Chirantan Bhatt, is grand as the film promises to be. First things first, lyrically this album is the epitome of Telugu literary prowess. Written by  , barring one ���Kadhaa Gaanam��� by Sai Madhav, all the songs are lyrically intense. The film is all about the 2nd century Satavahana king and the album successfully keeps up with the historical aura of it. Ekimeedena, a folkish duet by Shreya Ghoshal and Udit Narayana, marks the first song on the album. The fun mood of the duo in the song reflects in the instrumentation as well as the choruses. Following that, Gana Gana Gana keeps the spirits up. This celebratory song, which has Simha, Anand Bhaskar and Vamsi singing praises for the Satakarni king is is foot-tapping and gets pacy as it progresses and ends on a high. The magic of SP Balasubramanyam and Shreya Ghoshal���s voices unfolds in the next number, Mriganayana. The traditional instrumentation playing out along with the sensuous lyrics, it���s a song reflects the mood of lovers in their intimate moments. With intense lyrics, added to the western orchestral influences with cellos and choir choruses, Saaho Saarvabowma Saaho, is an interesting song. This war song will send chills down your spine. Next is  . With grand instrumentation, this song made in the ���Kadhaa Gaanam��� format presenting the glorious history of Satakarni in the folk form. While the basic instruments of the traditional burra katha, budike and tamboora ��� kept their place, the additional backing of grand instruments added to the mood of the story. Breaking the monotony of the usual format of commercial potboilers, this one is a breath of fresh air. But again, that is what would be expected for a grands epic like Gautamiputra Satakarni.
