JALANDHAR: Alleging that illegal sand mining was still on, SAD   Pawan Kumar   said if a vigilance or   probe was ordered to look into tippers involved in transportation of mining material, it would reveal that around 60% were owned by the police and transport department officials.

 He alleged that overloaded tippers were a grave threat to road safety and police were not taking any action despite precious lives having been lost in several accidents involving overloaded vehicles.
 
 Tinu, who stopped a few tippers in the last few days, said all those were overloaded and did not even have other documents. Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, he said illegal sand mining and plying of tippers overloaded with sand was happening due to direct patronage of the state government. “The tippers have become monsters on roads and have already taken several lives,” he added.
 
 Responding to queries from mediapersons, the Adampur MLA admitted that overloaded tippers were plying for the last two-three years. When asked if there was any difference between the SAD-BJP regime and the current Congress rule with regard to illegal sand mining, its transportation through overloaded tippers and police laxity, he said, “Nothing has changed, rather it is worse now.”
 
 When asked why he did not raise the issue during the SAD-BJP rule, he said, “People punished us if there was any deficiency. I am raising the issue of overloaded tippers because it directly endangers public safety.”
