Salem: Hands-on training on video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) was given to oncologists in Salem on Tuesday. SPMM in Salem and Thangam Cancer Centre in Namakkal jointly organized the session in the city. During the session, Dr Saravana Rajamanickam said treatment for lung cancers has improved vastly in the last decade with treatments for both early and advanced cancers. “Drugs now target cancer cells at a molecular level leading to promising outcomes,” he said.

 According to him, in early cancers, surgery is the treatment of choice although only 10% present in such a stage. Such surgery was performed traditionally in the open fashion which is extremely painful. In addition the existing practice was to remove the entire lung, a procedure very few tolerate. Current evidence suggests that a ‘lung sparing’ approach is the way forward. VATS, a key-hole approach to surgery has become standard all over the world for lung related diseases including cancer. tnn
