TIRUANNAMALAI: In a bid to rejuvenate the water bodies, the district administration has launched a drive to identify the lost ancient tanks (theertham) along the   path and around   in   town. 

 "Over 100 ancient tanks are missing, damaged or not in use. We have initiated a drive to identify the lost water bodies and revive them for better ulitisation," collector K S Kandasamy said after inaugurating the renovation of an ancient water tank next to Ema Lingam along Girivalam path on Thursday.
 
 The district administration has instructed the Tiruvannamalai municipality to join hands with   (water drop movement), a forum formed by youngsters in Tiruvannamalai town to identify and restore the water bodies, and Environmentalist Foundation of India to trace the water bodies and revive them.
 
  According to historians and environmentalists, the temple town had 365 theerthams (ancient tanks) within the radius of 5 to 10 km from  . The priests would bring water from one tank each day throughout the year to perform the morning pooja to the presiding deity. However, there's no such practice now.
 
 "Several water bodies are falling apart, encroached on and poorly maintained. Many have turned into garbage dumping yard. Some even have buildings on them," said an activist of the movement that renovated over 10 defunct and damaged water bodies.
