NAGPUR: Even though Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s   treatment plant (STP) has the capacity to treat only 130 MLD per day as against 550 MLD sewage generated daily in the city, the civic body is set to treat sewage of nearby towns as well. 

 A proposal on treating waste of adjacent small towns will be tabled before the general body meeting to be held on April 20. 
 
 A senior official from NMC’s Pench Project cell told TOI the state government had issued a notification directing   to treat waste generated in towns and villages near Nagpur where STP facility is not available. He said the civic body will treat the sewage free of cost on condition that the respective towns and villages have to de-sludge and transport the waste to Bhandewadi plant. He said Kalmeshwar and   had approached NMC in this regard. 
 
 The officer said the second STP having capacity to treat 200 MLD sewage water was almost ready and will be commissioned within a fortnight.
 
 Twenty seven other proposals will also come up before the general body. Nagpur Smart and Sustainable City Development Corporation Ltd ( ) has submitted a proposal to sign memorandum of understandings (MoUs) with other countries. Already, civic body has signed MoUs with Finland and Jinan (China) and now it intends to sign MoU with Karlsruhe (Germany), Wolverhampton (UK) and Mombasa (Kenya).
 
 At national level, government of India and Maharashtra government have signed MoUs and agreements with several countries including the above mentioned, a senior official from NSSCDCL said. He said the move would help NMC seek technical and financial assistance from these countries. The electric department has also submitted a proposal to participate in International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives- South Asia (ICLEI-SA), an international organization of local governments and national and regional local government organizations.
 
 The department said participating in ICLEI-SA will not incur any cost and will provide technical support to the city to achieve five milestones including preparing emissions inventories, identifying emission reduction measures, fostering city-to-city exchange of knowledge and experience through workshops and other training.
