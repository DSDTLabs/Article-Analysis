LUCKNOW: Lucknow has only 7,297   registered to ply within the city. The number of unauthorised e-rickshaws plying on the road is much higher. It is also one of the causes of traffic congestion.

 While the vehicles are meant to ply on feeder routes only, e-rickshaws ply on main routes as well, flouting norms. On Saturday, Lucknow district magistrate held a meeting on   plying on city roads and said strict action would be taken against drivers who do not mend their ways. 
 
 A person holding a valid   can only buy and operate an e-rickshaw else   (RTO) will not register his vehicle. But in the city it's not a strictly enforced norm. 
 
 Besides, while only 197 dealers are authorised to sell e-rickshaws, unauthorised dealers are also selling the e-rickshaws which do not confirm to safety norms of the government.
 
 DM has issued crackdown against the violation of norms. E-rickshaw drivers have been asked to get the   and registration for their vehicle.
