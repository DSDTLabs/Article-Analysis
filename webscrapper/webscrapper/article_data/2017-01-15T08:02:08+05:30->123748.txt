SHIMLA: Politics within the   is all set to intensify in the coming days with   (HPCC) seeking an explanation from its Bilaspur  , a staunch loyalist of chief minister  , for his alleged ugly spat with two government employees­ a divisional forest officer and a doctor in Bilaspur district recently.

 The MLA has been given 10 days to explain his position. An HPCC leader said, that a separate report on the two incidents has also been summoned from   president Kamlender Kashyap to get clear picture of incidents. “Alleged unruly behaviour of MLA has put the party in tight spot ahead of assembly elections as employees are not happy. After receiving the reply, further action would be initiated. Party has given the MLA a chance to clarify his stand," added the leader.
 
 While HPCC has sought a reply from the MLA, it would be interesting to see what stand the CM takes on the issue as Thakur is a loyalist, sources said.
 
 Another state Congress leader said the first instance of the MLA 's alleged spat with a government official came to light when he had allegedly entered into an argument with a divisional forest officer in Bilaspur who was stopped from performing his duty by the supporters of the MLA.
 
 He said the second incident became known when doctors raised their voice in protest against Thakur for allegedly threatening an orthopaedic surgeon over telephone on the issue of giving a handicap certificate.
