INDORE: For vehicle lifters in the city,   – a bird watcher’s paradise – has also emerged as a paradise for them to hide vehicles stolen by them.

 While locals go there for bird-watching, the members of a vehicle lifting gang in the city dump stolen vehicles in the lake and recover them later.
 
 The situation came to the fore after Dwarkapuri police arrested three members of the gang.
 
 While interrogating the accused, it was found that the gang had a peculiar way of hiding the stolen vehicles. They used to dump them inside the lake and then take them out after some time to sell their parts in different states.
 
 “The accused are also excellent divers and so they could reach the bottom of the deep lake easily and recover the vehicles with the help of a rope whenever they needed. They would not put an anchor to recover the vehicles,” Rupesh Dwivedi, ASP, told TOI. He added that there is a possibility that there were more vehicles inside the lake.
 
 Kalu Singh, alias Kaliya (26) and Roshan Singh (24) were arrested and booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.
 
 Both the accused live in   near   lake and they would dismantle the vehicles that they stole and dump the remaining parts in the lake. Police are interrogating the accused in different matters.
 
 Three bikes worth Rs 50,000 each were recovered from the lake by police officials after they were told about the location.
 
 It was also found out that both the accused have several cases of theft and nuisance against them. They are also listed goons of the police station.
