ALLAHABAD: In an attempt to encourage more mothers to appear for civil services examination, the   ( ) has authorised interview boards to allow infants to accompany women candidates during interviews. 

 The decision was taken after a woman candidate had to leave her child alone at the UPPSC headquarters, while appearing for an interview. The child ended up crying for her mother for over an hour before the latter's interview ended. Secretary of UPPSC,   said, "Most married women candidates continue their preparation for   (PCS) and other examinations even while they are raising a child, which is a good sign for the Indian society. We have decided to encourage more mothers to appear for the PCS examinations by allowing them to bring their children along during the interview."
 
 The interview boards, which conduct personality tests of candidates, however, would take the final decision on allowing the child to be present with his/her mother depending on the situation.
 
 "If the child is less than one-and-half-years old and is crying or yearning for her mother at the time of interview then they would be allowed to accompany them. It is the interview board which will have the final say on the issue," Jagdish said.
 
 He added that the rule would be effective from the upcoming combined state lower subordinate services exams.
