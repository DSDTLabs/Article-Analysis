Gold, once considered as the safe-haven investment option, has lost its value in recent years. The precious metal has given less than satisfactory returns in recent past. 

 During the Financial Year 2008-2017, foreign portfolio investors (FPI) bought $124 billion of Indian equity shares, thus increasing their holdings value to $368 billion (BSE-200 Index basis) as of March 2017, as compared to $132 billion in March 2007. As we can see,   prices increased three-fold in rupee terms over this period.
 
 The consumption of gold has also increased in the country thus a lot of import of gold happened. The bulk investment by the foreign investors and increased gold import fulled inflation. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the recent period has taken a lot of important steps targeting lower inflation than in the past, this is likely to keep gold import low. Thus fading out the value of gold as a tool to fight against inflation. 
 
 The price of standard gold was Rs 28,835 per 10 grams in May 2012 and today it is almost at the same level - the MCX rate on September 23 was Rs 29,585 per 10 gram. In past few years, the price of gold has fallen on a yearly basis, dampening the interest of investors. Investors today are not restricted to gold, they stepping out to find out new avenues of investments.
