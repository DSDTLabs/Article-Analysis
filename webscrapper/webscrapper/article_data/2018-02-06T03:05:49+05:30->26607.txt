NEW DELHI: A bridge course   by the government in   2017, has become the   between   of Indian systems of medicine and allopathy. While the former supports the government move,   doctors said they will do anything to stall it. Some of the opposition parties have also opposed the move.

 “Most MBBS and MD doctors practice in the cities. Rural areas are still being served by practitioners of Indian systems of medicine such as homeopathy and ayurveda. The   will help standardise treatment and improve public health services,” Dr Sunil Takalkar, member of All India Homeopathic Doctors Federation (AIHDF), said on Monday. The AIHDF is holding a two-day rally in New Delhi, in support of the NMC Bill.
 
 Monday, the first day of their rally, witnessed a gathering of nearly a thousand practitioners of alternative medicine and some politicians as well. AIHDF claimed several other MPs are supporting them.
 
 Gopal Shetty, BJP MP from Mumbai north, was one of them. “The opposition has nothing to do, so they oppose everything this government does. Bridge course is good and our government will ensure that it is passed in the parliament soon,” Shetty said, while addressing the crowd. 
 
 The NMC Bill, which seeks to replace the Medical Council of India, was introduced by Union health minister J P Nadda in the Lok Sabha on December 29 and in the Rajya Sabha on January 2. Following disagreement, the Lok Sabha decided to send the draft bill to the parliamentary standing committee (PSC) on health for review.
 
 The Indian Medical Commission (IMA), which represents allopathic practitioners from across the country, has opposed the bill. On Tuesday, resident doctors of AIIMS and Safdarjung will march to the parliament to oppose the NMC bill. “This bill is a disaster. It will deteriorate public health by allowing homeopathy and ayurveda doctors to prescribe allopathy medicines after a short course,” Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti, who heads the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association (RDA), said.
