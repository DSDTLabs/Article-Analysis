Ludhiana: More than 90,000 primary students and 62,344 secondary students in 1500 schools of the district have suffered because of the government failing to release the grants for the Mid Day Meal scheme for over three months. 

 Since July, teachers have been running the scheme by pooling expenses on cooking material. “We have nearly spent about Rs 60,000 to run the   in Government Primary School Haibowal Khurd to feed over 344 students for two months. We are required to buy many items daily, said head of the school Balwinder Singh.
 
 Rajeev Kumar, a government primary teacher said, “For July and August, we have received no money to run the scheme and it is already middle of September. We pooled in amongst ourselves to keep the scheme running. However, we cannot do this indefinitely. We will stop cooking the meal at our own expenses and buy for credit.”
 
 “No one is ready to spend from his own pocket. We have been doing this for two months. Most teachers have made up their minds rather than discontinue serving the meal. If funds are not released, we will buy on credit. We have bought supply for this month. However, the borrowing is getting bigger and we will have to stop’ said the headmaster of another government school.”
 
 However, he claimed that he would wait till the end of this month before taking this decision.
 
 Nazima , manager mid-day meal, Ludhiana , admitted that the funds for July and August have not been released due to some technical problem.
 
 While Jaspreet Kaur , DEO Elementary said that, “ We received the funds for a month only on Saturday. We will transfer the money very shortly. All teachers will be reimbursed. The government has taken up the matter with the relevant authorities and the balance money will be released soon.”
