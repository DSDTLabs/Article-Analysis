NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan’s decision to suspend six   MPs saw a united Opposition protest inside and outside  , resulting in the adjournment of the Lower House without transacting any meaningful business on Tuesday.
 
  An indicator on the day’s proceedings in the LS was available in the morning when MPs belonging to Congress,  ,  ,  ,  , CPI SP, etc staged a united dharna in front of the Gandhi statue in Parliament House by raising slogans against the suspension of six fellow MPs. When the House commenced at 11 am, the Speaker tactically averted a showdown by adjourning the proceedings till 3 pm to facilitate MPs to attend the swearing-in ceremony of President  .
  
  While the Opposition MPs attended the Central Hall function in full strength, they returned to raise the issue of suspension of MPs when the House reconvened. With many MPs resorting to slogan-shouting in the House, Congress floor leader Mallikarjun Kharge appealed to the Speaker to revoke the suspension by arguing such things, as throwing papers happened “in the heat of the moment”. Kharge and Trinamool Congress MP Saugata Roy appealed to the Speaker to show generosity and revoke the suspension to get the House to resume work.
  
  Parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar said incidents like MPs throwing papers at the Chair was unacceptable and told Kharge everybody was aware how Congress treated the Opposition when the party was in government. As Opposition parties continued with the protest, Mahajan appeared exasperated and emotional. She said if the Opposition was not interested in allowing the House to function, she was adjourning proceedings for the day. However, she allowed the HRD minister to introduce the Indian Institutes of Information Technology (Amendment) Bill, 2017.
