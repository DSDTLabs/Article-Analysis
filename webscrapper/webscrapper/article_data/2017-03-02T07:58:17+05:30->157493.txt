AHMEDABAD: What if you can hum a tune to remember the qualities of acids and bases, or use a board with nails to do multiplication? 

 These are the tools used by students of secondary standards - classes VI, VII and VIII - of   near Sanand, as teacher Bansi  , 32, has got them hooked to mathematics and science.
 
 “These were the main subjects where we recorded lower marks. When I thought about it, I found that it doesn’t have narrative or ‘story’ like in the languages or history. I then attended workshops by Vikram A   (VASCSC) and other organizations to learn new pedagogies. I decided to devise my own tools,” says Lakhtariya, who has been teaching for seven years. She is part of the ongoing Innovation Fair at VASCSC.
 
 The experiment started with positive and negative numbers, which stumped many students. “I started teaching using red and green dots, signifying positive and negative numbers respectively. I compared each dot with a soldier and interaction between them as ‘battle’ to give examples. The method worked. Next were nomograms — graphical calculating devices — made by the students themselves,” she says.
 
 With the nomograms, students can multiply two numbers - on first and last lines - to get the answer on the middle line. She demonstrates the use of it using rubber bands.
 
 Her most innovative method, however, is writing songs using popular Gujarati and Hindi tunes to teach scientific principles. Her version of “Vaishnav Jan” goes - ‘Acid to bhai tene kahiye je swade khata lage re’ (They are acids that taste sour).
