Navi Mumbai: The Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation ( ) kicked off an   cum competition as part of its   green initiative at  , Nerul, which will end on Sunday. 

 The civic tree authority has invited school and college students to have a look at the large number of plant, flower, fruit and vegetable species, as a nature study tour. The exhibition has information about unconventional ways of plantation. In a first of its kind attempt, the exhibition has stalls intended to promote different forms of urban farming like hydroponics, square feet gardening and plantation through unused PVC pipes. 
 
 Stalls exhibiting sample of plantation done using these techniques have been set up along with posters describing various methods.
 
 “Some residents are interested in gardening but lack of space proves to be a deterrent. Urban farming is a concept that we wanted residents to explore, whereby farming could be done even without soil plantation in small space. Such samples done through the concept of hydroponics or square meter gardening and gutter pipe plantation have been set up at the exhibition. It’s an initiative to promote urban farming,” said deputy municipal commissioner (garden) Tushar Pawar. 
 
 The exhibition also demonstrated innovative techniques to increase survival rate of trees planted in public domain. A private firm has developed a tree guard that not only safeguards newly planted sapling but also has a built-in drip water system mechanism.
 
 Smita Khandelwal , a local teacher, looked amazed at the collection on display but her only qualm was that Vashi was a better destination to hold the exhibition. "Not only is it more accessible but being such a busy junction, visitors are many," she said. She added that if the event was held twice a year, the response would be more encouraging.
