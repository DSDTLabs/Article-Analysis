NEW DELHI: An   has sought transfer of the   case from a single judge bench saying only a larger bench has jurisdiction to decide it.

 NGO  , which is one of the parties seeking to be heard by the court, has argued that the schools have challenged a statutory notification issued by the lieutenant governor and as per the Delhi   rules only a division bench is entitled to hear the plea.
 
 “The school associations filed the present writ petition by the way of very smart drafting where statutory notification issued by the lieutenant governor has been challenged but framed the prayer in a way that a clause of   is challenged,” the NGO, through advocate Khagesh Jha has argued.
 
 On Wednesday, a division bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar asked HC administration to reply by Thursday the status of the latest roster. The bench said it will take a call once the administration clears its stand on the issue.
 
 Since the main matter is also slated to be heard on Thursday before Justice Manmohan, it remains to be seen if the division bench will issue any orders or leave it to the single judge to decide.
