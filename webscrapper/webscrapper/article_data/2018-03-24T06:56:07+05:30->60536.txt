CHANDIGARH: Performance audit of the working of   Development Authority by the Comptroller and Auditor General ( ) has brought to fore several financial management deficiencies, including release of Rs 289 crore for the works which did not fall in its jurisdiction.

 “Since GMADA resorted to incremental borrowing every year to finance its operations, funding of activities outside its scope further increased its debt burden,” CAG has highlighted in its report tabled in the Punjab assembly on Thursday.
 
  
 
 In GMADA’s audit for the period 2012-17, the CAG has also pointed out that GMADA could not provide houses to the economically weaker sections of the society in spite of earmarking of 263.29 acre land and 201 flats in mega residential projects. The auditors have highlighted external development charges and license fee of Rs 174 crore from 18 real estate developers and Rs 230 crore from 13 mega projects’ developers were still recoverable as of August 2017 despite frequently allowing moratoriums and increasing the number of installments between June 2010 and January 2017.
 
 Elaborating on GMADA stepping out of its jurisdiction, the audit report points out that on Punjab government’s directions, GMADA released Rs 638 crore in December 2014 to various municipal corporations, PWD and Punjab Health Systems Corporation for execution of various developmental works. Out of this, Rs 289.88 crore were either transferred to other departments or spent on the acquisition of land for airport and conducting Agro summit which as per CAG were outside GMADA’s scope.
 
 It has also come to the notice of auditors that in violation of the November 2013 instructions of labour commissioner for recovery of labour cess, GMADA approved four building plans werein the estimated cost of construction was calculated at the rate of Rs 750 instead of Rs 900 per square feet. It resulted in   of labour cess of Rs 19.88 lakh. Also, in 13 cases, labour cess of Rs 5.24 crore was short deposited by the concerned real estate developers.
 
 The auditors have also pointed out despite the Supreme Court’s Janaury 2014 directions for payment of enhanced land compensation of Rs 2 lakh per acre in 122 cases within three months, the GMADA land
 
 acquisition collector (LAC) paid it in 2016. “LAC paid (January and February 2016) the enhanced compensation of Rs 7.90 crore in 122 cases with a delay of 22 months which resulted in avoidable payment of interest of Rs 2.18 crore,” reads the report.
 
 It has also come to fore in the audit report that piecemeal acquisition of land by GMADA led to an avoidable extra expenditure of Rs 18.40 crore. Auditors have also stated non-obtaining of encumbrance free land and ill planning in setting up of two sewerage treatment plants (STPs) by GMADA at Dera Bassi and Lalru led to ungainful expenditure of Rs 8.23 crore (Rs 4.27 crore for Dera Bassi and Rs 3.96 crore for Lalru) as both the STPs could not be commissioned till June 2017.
