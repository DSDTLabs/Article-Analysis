JAIPUR: Entry to   was banned for morning walkers on Monday after a female leopard was sighted on the   in the heart of the city on Sunday night.

 The leopard and its cub strayed into the city from Jaipur's Jhalana forests near Smiriti Van around 1am, keeping forest officials on their toes till Monday morning. Some commuters clicked photographs of the animal and send them to forest officials who launched a search for the two.
 
 The feline was for a while separated from her cub and roamed across JLN Marg, giving a nasty surprise to late night commuters. The two were soon reunited and headed back to the forest area after finding themselves in the midst of human commotion.
 
 According to reports , the mother leopard crossed the JLN Road thrice in search of the cub.
 
 Forest officials, however, stuck around the spot as they knew the leopard had two cubs. Officials thought the big cat would come searching for her other cub and closed the Smriti Van.
 
 It was later found that the mother leopard had strayed into the city with just one cub.
 
 In the morning, rescue teams searched the Smriti Van along with a medical team.
 
 “The territory of this leopard is close to Smirti Van and JLN Marg. The mother came out to the road in search of her cub. We will trace the movement of this leopard on Monday night and may close the park even on Tuesday if required,” said forest ranger Surendra Sharma.
 
 Last year in December, a panther cub had made its way into the staff quarters of the University of Rajasthan, triggering a scare among staff and students. The panther had sneaked into the university campus from the adjoining  . “The cub from same leopard entered the university campus after it jumped the wall. But, it couldn’t climb back,” added Sharma.
