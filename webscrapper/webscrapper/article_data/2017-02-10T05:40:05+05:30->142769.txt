MUMBAI: Even as more city   to be part of the   process for seats under Right to Education ( ) Act this year, fewer seats are on offer.Last year, 9,664 seats were available at 317 schools. This academic year, there are only 7,449 seats at 334 schools.

 The admission portal will be open till February 25.
 
 The reason for this is a government resolution issued in January which has given schools the choice to pick their own entry level for the admission under the RTE quota. Until last year, the entry level was the lowest class that a school offered. However, several schools were unwilling to give admissions in the pre primary section as they did not get compensation from the government for a student's education up to class I.
 
 While the number of class I and pre-primary seats has dipped, pre-primary seats are down to almost half.Officials said that the choice had many schools declaring class I as their entry level.“With the rule change, more and more schools didn't want the burden of admitting students in the pre-primary section. Besides, the number of vacancies in class I is much lower because those admitted under the RTE quota three years ago are now in class I,“ said an official from  's education department, which conducts admissions.
