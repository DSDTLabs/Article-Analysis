The annual music concert   organised by cultural organisation Kala Prakash and hosted by Ashok Gupta was a delightful experience. The guests turned up in ethnic wear in white and pink, the colour code of the evening. The ladies were welcomed with a red rose while the men with a pink stole and gulaal. Itra was sprinkled at regular intervals on the guests, who listened with rapt attention to vocalist Aarti Ankalikar, who mesmerised with her rendition of Hori and other raag based songs. The composition Piya Khelo Ri, Kesariya Aangiya Rang Dari, evoked a loud applause . The music concert attracted a lot of music lovers from the city and even abroad.
