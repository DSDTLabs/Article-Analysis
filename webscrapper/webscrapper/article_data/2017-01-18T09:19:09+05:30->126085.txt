Srikakulam: In a bid to make Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts drought-free, the   government is planning to link a number of rivers by the end of June. Officials have proposed to undertake two projects to link Vamsadhara and Nagavali rivers and Vegavathi-Champavati-Suvarnamukhi and Nagavali rivers. The proposals are awaiting administrative sanctions. 

 According to sources, the existing high level canal of 33 km would be extended between   on Vamsadhara river and Narayanapur barrage on Nagavali river. 
 
 The project will be taken up at an estimated cost of Rs 84 crore and will enhance the canal capacity from 130 cusecs to 600 cusecs. For this, the government will need to acquire 200 acres land. As Vamasadhara river has abundant waterflow throughout the year, the linkage will aid farmers along Nagavali river by providing irrigation water across 18,530 acres during the deficit rainfall period between September and October. 
 
 The second project would link rivers Nagavali with Suvarnamukhi-Vegavathi and Champavati at an estimated cost of Rs 18 crore. There would be three links on the Thotapalli main canal of 117 km to the tailend at Gadigedda Reservoir. The government would increase the capacity of the   from 0.12 TMC (thousand million cu.ft) to 0.25 TMC and link it to Champavati river through a canal. 
 
 "With these projects, the government is trying to meet irrigation and drinking water needs of two north coastal districts. We wish to complete these projects by the end of June," irrigation minister   told TOI.
