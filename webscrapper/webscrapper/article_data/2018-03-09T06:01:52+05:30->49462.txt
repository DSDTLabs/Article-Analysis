Five-time   Award winner   says she doesnt care about them.

 "In the music business, if you care about the   and submitting your stuff before a certain time frame, you want a single out in the summer,"   said in an interview with V Magazine.
 
 "And then you want to have a record (out) before the Grammys (consideration) deadline, which has changed. Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn," she said, referencing the iconic line from the film 'Gone With the Wind', reports people.com.
 
 She further said: "I mean, I have five Grammys. That's cute. There's people that have been doing this half the time that have twice as many.
 
 "I won two Grammys the first year I started, but after that, (the Grammys) are like, â€˜We don't go with the people that are selling a lot of records and are popular; we're gonna go the opposite way'.
 
 "So, I got screwed out of certain years. I wasn't bitter about it. I was just like, okay, well, I guess I'm not standing here barefoot onstage singing and trying to go a certain way. I'm just me."
 
 The "We belong together" hitmaker said that while the music industry is a business, she considers herself an artiste.
 
 "I consider myself more of a musician first than a business person, I don't necessarily think of things that way; it's music first," she said.
