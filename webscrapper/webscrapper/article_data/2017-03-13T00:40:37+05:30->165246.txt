NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old   was crushed and three others were critically   after a speeding   bus ran over them while they were selling flowers on a footpath in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh on Sunday morning.

 The incident took place around 10.15am when the driver lost control of the   and climbed onto the pavement where the men had set up their stalls. The bus runs on route 567 (Nangloi to Lajpat Nagar). The florists had been setting up their stalls at West Avenue road in Central Market for the past one year.
 
 The police rushed the four men to a nearby hospital where one of them, identified as Raja, was declared   on arrival. The injured men — Mithun (33), Rakesh Kumar (26) and Shankar (30) — are currently out of danger.
 
 The errant driver, Sandeep Kumar (40), was caught by the locals, but he gave a fight and tried to run away. 
 
 However, he was nabbed by the policemen who arrived soon after getting the PCR call. “The bus driver was arrested from the spot. His blood sample has been sent for medical examination to ascertain whether he was drunk at the time of the incident,” said DCP (west) Vijay Kumar.
 
 The victims lived together and had set up their stalls an hour before the incident took place. Raja’s family had shifted to Delhi a month ago. “Raja did his schooling from Munger, but always wanted to shift to Delhi. He was fascinated with flowers and had promised his father that he would become a famous florist one day,” said Manish, his relative.
 
 The deceased man had also been collecting money for his sister’s marriage and a shop to start his business. 
 
 “It broke my heart to see his body lying next to the fresh flowers he had brought to sell,” Manish added.
 
 Kumar told the police that a vehicle ahead of the bus took a sudden U-turn and he increased his speed to avoid hitting it. Police suspect that the bus driver was speeding and that’s why he lost control and couldn’t apply the brakes in time.
