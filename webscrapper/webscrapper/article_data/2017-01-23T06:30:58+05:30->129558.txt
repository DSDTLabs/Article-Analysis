LUCKNOW: Hours before the formal announcement of the alliance between   and Congress on Sunday,   recollected how during his recent visit to a school in Rae Bareli, a student identified him as   saying that the media will get a hint of what he wanted to say. 

 Later in the evening, the two parties formally announced a pre-poll tie-up at a joint press conference in Lucknow. 
 
  The Samajwadi Party national president was addressing party workers and the media while releasing the election manifesto at the party headquarters and was talking about the need for improving the education system in the state when he was reminded of a recent visit to a government school in Amethi. 
 
 "I walked into a classroom and asked one of the students if he recognises me... he said yes. When I asked him who I was, he said Rahul Gandhi," Akhilesh said.
