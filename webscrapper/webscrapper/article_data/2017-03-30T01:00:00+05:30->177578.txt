Director Ashwin Saravanan of Maya fame has begun shooting for his next film, which has SJ Suryah and Sshivada in the lead roles. The latest we hear is that actress  , who made her Kollywood debut in Selvaraghavan’s Malai Nerathu Mayakkam, has been roped in to play another lead.

 A source says, “Wamiqa has already begun shooting for her portions. The actress was busy working on a couple of Telugu films. Though she has been listening to scripts in Tamil, it was this project that appealed to her. Major portions of the film will be shot in and around the city. On the lines of Ashwin’s debut film, this one, too, is expected to be a suspense thriller.”
