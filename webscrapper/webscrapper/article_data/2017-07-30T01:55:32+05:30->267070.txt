NEW DELHI: The Rajghat thermal power plant is slated to be turned into an “energy museum.” The coal-based plant, whose current units were commissioned in 1989, has been lying in a shutdown mode from 2014 and has outlived its shelf life of 25 years.

 “We got a formal proposal from Delhi tourism (DTTDC) but before executing that plan, we will move for a formal closure of the plant which has still not technically and financially closed,” said a senior official from the power department of  .
 
 The whole plant can still be made functional but the last functional coal-based plant had huge repercussions, both in terms of cost as well as toxic emissions.
 
 “There are plans to remove some of the existing machinery and use the space for display of the equipment used in the power sector and how it has evolved with time. Since the backdrop will be formed by a former electricity generation plant, it will turn out to be a popular tourist spot,” said an official from the tourism department. Delhi, which has now become the power capital of the country with highest ever peak power demand of 6361MW this year — much more than many of the other metropolitan cities combined — started its power generation with a mere 2MW diesel set in   gate in 1903.
 
 The Rajghat location played an important role in the power growth story of the capital. After the independence,   was installed in 1951 with 5MW capacity. In the second five year plan, three diesel generating sets totaling 20 MW were installed at different locations in Delhi. A 15MW unit was installed at Rajghat in 1966 followed by three units of 67.5MW each in 1967-68 at Indraprastha  , finally leading to two current units of 135MW capacity being installed in 1989.
