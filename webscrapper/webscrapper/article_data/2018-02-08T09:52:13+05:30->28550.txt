He has unleashed a laughter riot with ease in many films and even played villain in a few. 

 As he debuts in Tamil through the Rahman starrer thriller film  , Malayalam actor Tini Tom tries an altogether different turf of acting as well. He plays the role of a transgender in the film and is quite kicked about it. The first schedule of the project, directed by Prash, is just over and Tini speaks about handling the unconventional role.
 
 “As I am into mimicry, I had a confidence that I can handle it decently. But, it was indeed challenging to turn someone of my size into the get up of a transgender person. Both the director and Rahman sir were sure that I can do it and strongly recommended me for this role,” Tini says. One by Two fame Abhinaya is the heroine of the film, which has Rahman appearing in the role of a naval officer. 
 
 Earlier, the director had told us that Arapaima is said to be the largest fresh water fish, which is found in the Amazon river, and that it’s friendly if you treat it well and can be violent if not. The film’s protagonist, apparently, has a similar character. 
 
 Meanwhile, Tini says Tamil isn’t a challenge for him. “As I watch many Tamil films, I could learn the dialogues well enough. Moreover, choreographer Kala master’s nephew Aravind, who is also part of the cast, helped me with it.” The rest of it’s shoot will soon commence in Chennai.
