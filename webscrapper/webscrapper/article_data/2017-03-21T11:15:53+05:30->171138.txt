PALANPUR: A   attacked a man in Jodkampa village of   of Sabarkantha late evening on Sunday. 

 According to range forest officer (RFO) B K Parmar, after being attacked by bear, Khamji Katara of Jodkampa was rushed to  . He said Katara was attacked when he was on his way to supply milk at the local milk collecting centre of Sabar Dairy.
 
 After the incident, forest department officials set up two cages and issued warning to surrounding villages to be on guard. “We have asked the villagers to move collectively, not alone. Also, carry a stick while moving out of the village,” Parmar advised.
 
 He said it was just coincidence that the victim came in way when the bear was passing through a narrow lane between the fencings around the farms.
 
 Nearly, 10 forest officers have been deployed to trace the animal, said Parmar, adding that the Polo forest has about 30 sloth bears. “Probably, the bear might have shifted to its habitat in nearby Polo forest,” said the RFO.
 
 Last week, a sloth bear, which had mauled to death three persons including forester, was shot dead by the joint team of forest officials and local police.
