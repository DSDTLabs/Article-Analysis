CHENNAI: At a time when   in the state are witnessing unprecedented shortfall in rice, dal and cooking oil, a PIL regarding the issue failed to impress the Madras high court. The court dismissed the   (PIL) saying it was not backed by material particulars and that it was based on newspaper reports.

 Holding that the grievance of the petitioner cannot be termed as PIL, the first bench of acting Chief Justice Huluvadi G Ramesh and Justice M Sundar said, “It is the submission of the government pleader that the state of Tamil Nadu is one of the best states in supplying   to poor and needy people. We are of the view that the petitioner is bereft of material particulars or statistics. Writ petition is based on newspaper reports and without any other ground work,“ it said.
 
 The PIL of D Simon from Kodungaiyur said when the state was already under the grip of severe drought, fair price shops were not distributing essential items like sugar, kerosene, palmolein and dal. The 20kg of rice that was given free to cardholders every month, has now been reduced to 10 kg.Poor people are being forced to take wheat instead of rice, he said, adding that several newspapers had written about the issue.
 
 Citing reports, he said the reason for shortage was the failure of the government to place procurement tenders on time. It is the bounden duty of the state government to ensure unhindered supply of essential items, especially in a drought year, the PIL said.
