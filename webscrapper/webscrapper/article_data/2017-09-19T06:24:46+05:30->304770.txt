KOCHI: In a major setback, the Angamaly judicial first class magistrate court on Monday denied   bail in the   case. This was the fourth time the court has denied him bail.

 The court noted that “petitioner can apply for default   only if the investigating agency fails to file the final report within 90 days.”
 
 The court went on to say that the punishment provided for offence under section 376 D (gang rape) of the IPC is rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 20 years which may extend to life which shall mean imprisonment for the reminder of that person’s natural life. 
 
 Dileep’s counsel argued that the allegation against the actor was conspiracy to videograph the naked body of the survivor and from the report filed by the investigation agency there was nothing to conclude that the object of the criminal conspiracy was to abduct the actor for sexual assault. 
 
 The counsel argued in his bail plea that in the first information statement the version of the survivor was that she was told by the first accused (‘Pulsar’ Suni) that he got a quotation to take naked video of her for the party who has engaged him to do the crime. 
 
 The counsel further argued that considering the available materials, rape or gang rape cannot be attributed against the actor on the basis of conspiracy charges levelled against him. The actor is entitled to statutory bail as the chargesheet was not filed within 60 days, which was completed on September 9.
 
 But the prosecution raised objection stating that the specific allegation is that the petitioner conspired with the first accused to videograph not only her naked body but also the sexual assault and first accused acted as per that conspiracy. In such circumstance, the allegation against the actor is punishable under section 376 D of the IPC.
 
 Earlier the same court had denied him bail. Later, he approached the high court twice and failed to get bail. Dileep has spent 71 days in custody till Monday.
