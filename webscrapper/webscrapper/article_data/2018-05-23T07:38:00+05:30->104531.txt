Ludhiana: Vigilance Bureau has arrested a reader of the revenue department sub-registrar and his two aides on Tuesday for accepting Rs 5,000 from Kuldeep Kaur (a widow) of Golden Colony to cancel a power of attorney. Vigilance officials also recovered the money from their possession. The arrested accused have been identified as Suresh Kumar, reader of sub-registrar (Central); and his private aides Himmat Singh of Basant Nagar, and Jaspal Singh. A case under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act has been registered against them, following Kuldeep’s statement.

 Investigating officer inspector Rajinder Kumar said Kuldeep had given the power of attorney of her property to Ajay Kumar of Shimlapuri on 27 October 2016, and had applied for cancellation of power of attorney on 4 May. Meanwhile, Himmat Singh of Basant Nagar, claiming to be the private assistant of reader Suresh Kumar, contacted her, and demanded Rs 6,000 as bribe to get her work done.
 
 Kuldeep said on 11 May, the power of attorney had been cancelled by the sub-registrar’s office, but the accused had kept the cancellation certificate with them, and again demanded Rs 6,000 to give her the document. However, the deal was cracked in Rs 5,000. On Tuesday, as the accused accepted the bribe from her, Vigilance Bureau caught the accused red-handed.
