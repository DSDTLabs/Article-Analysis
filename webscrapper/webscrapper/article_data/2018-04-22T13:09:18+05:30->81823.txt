LUDHIANA:   district vice-president   has raised allegations against civic officials for not paying attention towards collection of  .

 In an RTI query regarding total tax collection from a liquor vend, he claimed that the MC officials replied that they had not received any tax in the past three years except for 2017-18 when they collected Rs 33,413 from the owner.
 
 Mehta said he had asked the MC officials to reply whether they are receiving anything from this liquor vend and drinking palace situated opposite   in old city area through an RTI application. The MC officials replied that owner did not pay anything and filed the tax against a vacant plot which is exempted from the property tax.
 
 Mehta also alleged that the owner is earning money by giving the place on rent and he is not paying anything to MC. He said MC recovered Rs 33,413 from the owner after he had filed a query with the department.
 
 Mehta, a former councillor, said some years ago, MC had decided to collect a lump sum amount from liquor vends which was never implemented by the officials reasons best known to them.
 
 Superintendent of property tax Vivek Verma said liquor vends and drinking palaces are usually operational on a rental basis and there is provision to recover 7% of total annual rent but property tax is based on self-assessment method.
 
 He said people file the tax as per their convenience and they can only find out any defaulter after cross checking which is not possible to conduct in routine due to paucity of staff.
