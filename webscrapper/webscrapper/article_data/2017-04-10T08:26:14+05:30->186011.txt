NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has written to the   and   director for personal attendance on April 19 regarding sacking of a senior resident. A complaint was filed by the senior resident (SR) of anesthesia department after he was sacked for alleged medical negligence that led to the death of a nurse.

 The SR, who belongs to Angami tribe in Kohima, Nagaland, has alleged that the committee that probed the incident was biased against him, a charge denied by the institute.
 
 “I have been discriminated for being a minority belonging to a scheduled tribe, and I was made a scapegoat in the whole situation to protect connected people who were at fault. How can I be held responsible for a patient that was shifted against my advice to an unauthorised OT and when my junior resident gave anesthesia against my advice? My best efforts helped revive the patient who was then shifted to the ICU,” the SR said in the complaint to NSCT.
 
 AIIMS had earlier sent a copy of the inquiry report to justify action against the SR and stated that there was no discrimination against him. Rajbir Kaur, 28, a nursing officer with AIIMS’ medicine department, was declared dead in February after being on ventilator support for three weeks. She was admitted to the hospital for delivery on January 16. Her family members and colleagues claimed that hours before delivery, doctors found out that there was a threat to the unborn child’s life. An emergency caesarean section planned to deliver the baby was delayed as the anesthetist arrived late, they claimed.
