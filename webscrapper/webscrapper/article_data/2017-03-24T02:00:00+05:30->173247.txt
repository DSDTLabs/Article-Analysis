PATNA: The Bihar Museum will remain closed for visitors from March 28 to April 7 for maintenance works.

 The museum, a brainchild of CM Nitish Kumar, was inaugurated by him on August 7, 2015, a few weeks before the assembly election. As of now, only the Orientation Gallery and Children’s Gallery are open for visitors.
 
 “The contractor Larsen & Toubro has been demanding to shut the Children’s Gallery for quite some time. There are some structural as well as fabrication snags, which need to be rectified,” museum’s additional director J P N Singh said on Thursday, adding the closure might be extended beyond April 7 depending on the contractor’s need.
 
 Meanwhile, the Regional Art, Contemporary Art, Historical Art and Bihari Diaspora galleries of the Bihar Museum are scheduled to be opened in October. The majestic sculpture of Didarganj Yakshi, which has been kept at the Patna Museum since its discovery in 1917, is proposed to be shifted to the Bihar Museum. 
 
 “The Bihari Diaspora gallery will be dedicated to renowned Bihar natives who have brought laurels to the state,” said another museum official.
