KOLKATA: It may be a modest start but 35 streetchildren living under the Gariahat flyover now have access to clean wholesome food, thanks to the efforts by a group of youngsters led by a teacher from Asansol. The group also feeds nearly 118 more children in places like Chelidanga and Beldanga in Asansol. Now, the   (FEED) has been allowed to interact with members of the   initiative through the United Nations’ Food and Agricultural Organisation. 

 “The idea first struck me in 2015 when I noticed the large quantity of food wasted at our college canteen, hostels and parties. I also realised how much food gets wasted when I organized my son’s birthday party. I got together with a team of students and made a short film ‘Stop Food Wastage’ that went viral. People who watched the film actually stopped wasting food,” says Chandra Sekhar Kundu, the brain behind the drive. 
 
 After going through UN statistics on how 19.5 crore people in India suffer from malnutrition and foodgrains rot in   (FCI) godowns, he filed an RTI petition, seeking to know exactly how much foodgrain is destroyed at FCI units. In reply, FCI wrote the amount of foodgrains lost in the last two years is staggering. Kundu then wrote to the President, urging him to intervene and stop this wastage and launch a campaign to feed streetchildren. The FCI wrote to Kundu again, stating measures being taken to stem the wastage. 
 
 “My second issue on feeding hungry mouths wasn’t solved and I got together with two students to urge a hostel manager to collect extra food and distribute it among children on the streets. Others joined in. We then started going around to organisations that have staff canteens, including government ones. After photographs were posted online, an MNC in south Kolkata got in touch and offered assistance. Now, the caterer who runs the MNC’s staff canteen gives us sufficient food to feed the 35 children at Gariahat and four pregnant women living there,” Kundu adds.
