BENGALURU: Startup and IT hubs of Benglauru may be the largest energy consumers in the city but this has not ensured they get quality power supply . The 14 localities ­ HSR Layout, Koramangala, Whitefield, Electronics City and   ­ coming under South Circle of Bangalore Electric Supply Company (Bescom) face an average of 1,505 power supply interruptions, leaving the utility poorer by Rs 89.12 lakh every month.

 After these perturbing findings emerged from a study by Bescom, the energy supplier readied a host of initiatives to up the capacity of power infrastructure in these areas to ensure quality supply of electricity, and kept aside Rs 20 crore for it.The utility's measures like staggering   have failed, while moves to increase the number of substations have ended in court, over land acquisition issues.
 
 Officials say startups and commercialization are pushing up energy demand but the infrastructure is unable to take it. “Our analysis of South Circle says the load growth in some of these areas is 12% to 15% every year for the past two or three years. The number of power interruptions in these areas is also highest -more than 742 hours on an average ev ery month. This has pushed us into planning ahead of crisis situations,“ said P  , MD, Bescom.
 
 Bescom is procuring new transformers that will be installed in places which have higher capacity. “For this, we need to separate the network and need additional infrastructure to place these highpowered transformers. A tender has been floated,“ he added. Replacing damaged poles and procuring advanced equipment is part of Bescom's plan to address the problem.
 
 He said many more 66kV stations are required to increase the capacity of lines, for which land is required.
