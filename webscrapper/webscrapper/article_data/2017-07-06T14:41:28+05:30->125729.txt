  Veteran   actor, Ranjeet said, “I have played many negative roles before, but this one was really challenging, because I had to be funny along with being negative.   and again Gamosha and the 'Trideviyaan' who are set out to fight each other, keep meeting on different occasions but never end up fighting.”
