 cause the two corporations have been running in loss for long, the government was not willing to   into them.
 
 “We would like to increase the salary of employees but we did not have funds. Now that UPICA has recorded a profit for two years, we are looking at the possibility of implementing the fifth pay commission for its staff. But there is no such plan for UP Handlooms for the time being,” he said.
