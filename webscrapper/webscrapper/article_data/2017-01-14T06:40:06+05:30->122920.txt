FAZILKA/SANGRUR/FATEHGARH SAHIB: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP   was seen as the villain of the piece last year when he allegedly compromised Parliament’s security while doing a ‘Facebook Live’ video. For many youngsters in Punjab, however, he is a star who also provides comic relief.

 Around 9.30pm at Brass village in Fatehgarh Sahib, Mann, who is fighting against Punjab’s deputy CM and SAD chief Sukhbir   from Jalalabad, is in his element, using his skills as a stand-up comedian to first draw a crowd and then warm them up on a cold night. In his crosshairs are the powerful Badal family and Punjab Congress chief Captain  .
 
 “TV channel te doston ... Badal Badal Badal, wadda Badal, chhota Badal, chhoti Badal, bibi Badal.. Aaj mausam kharab hai toh bade Badal, aur saaf hai fir wi Badal. [TV channels only show the ‘Badals’ — If the weather is bad, they show big ‘Badal’ (Hindi for clouds); and they show ‘Badal’ even if the weather is clear],” he says.
 
 “They will all go into cold storage on February 4 (election date),” he says, mimicking a female anchor.
 
 For the crowd, his act serves as a reminder of ‘Jugnu’, a TV character he played in a comedy series in 1993.
 
 Attacking the Punjab Congress chief, he says, “We have Amarinder, who refers to himself as a lion, but keeps calling our party boss Arvind (Kejriwal) to fight him. Have you seen a lion who calls his prey to the jungle?”
 
 The giggles and Jugnuchants are endless in the audience made up largely of jobless youth and out-ofwork farmers. “What Mann shares is both entertaining and eye-opening,” says one Joginder, a villager in Sunam. Many of the audience members lift their mobile phones to film him. At the end of every address, Mann is mobbed by fans.
 
 In a complaint to the EC, SAD has accused Mann of inciting voters to throw stones at its members, a charge he has rubbished. “I condemn such shoe-throwing and booing incidents,” he insists. Both SAD and Congress dub him a non-serious street satirist.
