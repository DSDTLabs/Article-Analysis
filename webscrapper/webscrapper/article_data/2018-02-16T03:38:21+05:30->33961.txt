JIND: With nearly a year to go for the 2019   elections,   national president   on Thursday virtually put his party in poll mode in Haryana with the ‘Yuva Hoonkar Rally’ in Jind. Not only did he ask people to give BJP all Lok Sabha seats in the state this time, he also reminded everyone that   had launched his campaign to become Prime Minister in 2013 from Haryana. 

 Referring to assembly polls in Meghalaya, Tripura and  , he added that BJP was ruling in 19 states of the country at present and would add three more states by March 3. “Main ye kahne aaya hun ki 2014 mein aapne kuch seat kam di thee. Is baar 10 ki 10 seaton pe bhagwa fahra dena (In the 2014 polls, Haryana had not given us a few seats less, but this time I want you to create a saffron wave on all 10 seats),” Shah told a large gathering. 
 
 BJP had won seven seats in 2014 polls. Immediately after being declared as BJP’s prime ministerial candidate in September 2013, Modi had held a rally of ex-servicemen in Rewari and promised, among other things, implementation of the one-rank-one-pension. Shah’s kicking off his election campaign from Jind is significant as the district is seen as the political heart of the state. 
 
 The region also has a large presence of Jats who are upset with BJP over not getting OBC reservation. After arriving in a chopper, Shah took a short bike ride to the rally venue by riding pillion behind Haryana BJP chief Subhash Barala. During his speech, Shah said, “Haryana is a land of warriors, sportspersons, farmers and martyrs and I am here to offer my respects to them.” “UPA could not give OROP to soldiers in 40 years but the PM accepted it within one year of coming to power. BJP has also ensured that farmers get more than the cost on their agriculture produce,” he added
