Nagpur: The Goods & Service Tax (GST) is one of the biggest tax reforms taken place in India. It is very important that we should have a   helpdesk wherein GST department officials along with Chartered Accountants should work together which will prove to be more beneficial and effective for addressing the practical issues being faced by the dealers, said SM Choudhary, director (finance) of Western Coalfields Limited (WCL). 

 He was speaking as chief guest at a   on ‘GST in   Sector’, organized by Nagpur branch of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). 
 
 “With this new system we are rest assured that no transaction will be evaded and the tax liability will be discharged by the dealers at all levels,” he said.
 
 “The major problem is being faced in the rural areas because of the infrastructure and connectivity problems. Many of the units are located in remote areas where there is no connectivity and in such situation monthly compliance is a very big challenge especially in sectors where the volume of data is huge,” the WCL official said.
 
 “These challenges become bigger when portal do not respond and also when the e-mails bounce back from the portal. To address all such issues regular interaction should be done by the department and helpdesk should be started at all the places including the rural areas.”
 
 CAs Julfesh Shah, Sandeep Jotwani, Kirit Kalyani and Suren Duragkar along with BK Jha GM (finance), WCL, NK Mahadevan, MS Parihar, Anurag Arora and Jayant Mishra Sanjiv Soni, MK Baluka and others were present on the occasion.
