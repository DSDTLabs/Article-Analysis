THANE: A day after TOI reported about the death of over a dozen fish in the 17ft   well at   area, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) immediately sprang into action and took up well’s cleaning.

 Despite informing the civic body about the situation on Wednesday, no action was taken until TOI reported about the issue on Monday. “On January 18, we found one fish dead in the well and immediately wrote a letter to the commissioner. We even sought help of officials from the civic water department, but in vain,” said Anil Morye, a resident.
 
 However, only after TOI reported about the issue on Monday, the officials of Solid Waste Management department cleared away the floating bodies of the   while the pollution control department took up the task of disinfecting the well by sprinkling potassium permanganate to dissolve the toxicity of the water.
 
 “We got the complaint about the well and immediately took steps to resolve it. We have controlled whatever toxins present in the well. I have also written to the water supply department to clean the rest of the well and ensure that the residents get their share of drinking water,” said Manisha Pradhan, head of the pollution control department, TMC.
 
 While the cleaning activities are still underway, residents point out that the corporation should also focus on the main cause of the issue and direct the drainage line elsewhere. 
 
 “In the road widening process, the drainage line was directed near the well which has resulted in it leaking into the drinking water. While we are relieved that the corporation is cleaning the well, it will be pointless if they don’t shift the drainage line,” Morye said.
