ALLAHABAD: A full bench of Allahabad   has held that   for   is also implementable in government-aided minority intermediate colleges of the state.

 The verdict was passed by three-judge full bench comprising Chief Justice Dilip Babasaheb Bhosale, Justice   and Justice Yashwant Varma while hearing a slew of writ petitions filed by some minority institutions and their teachers.
 
 The contention of the minority institutions was that they are protected by Article 30 of the Constitution, which gives them freedom to manage themselves. Hence, the GO of 2005 cannot curtail this freedom guaranteed by the Constitution.
 
 However, the teachers of various minority institutions contended before the court that by enforcing the provisions of promotion of a teacher from a lower to higher grade in the same institution, no constitutional provision was going to be violated because these teachers were earlier appointed by the minority institutions itself. 
 
 Hence, these promotions do not curtail freedom of management of an institution to manage it. Rather, it is their right to be considered for promotion, it was contended.
 
 As per a Government Order (GO) dated November 25, 2005, a teacher, employed for teaching primary classes in a government-aided intermediate college, can seek promotion in the next higher grade under the 25% promotion quota envisaged by the GO.
