The temple town which is a popular destination among celebrities, saw the couple paying obeisance to the deity, after which they participated in a mega charity event. “Yash and I have been extremely vocal about our desire to participate in social causes and support charity work and we never pass up an opportunity to be part of such events. Dharmasthala, besides being one of Yash’s favourite temples, was also one of the first stops on the holy trail soon after our wedding. It was only befitting that we went there for a cause that is most worthwhile — a mass marriage event,” says Radhika.
