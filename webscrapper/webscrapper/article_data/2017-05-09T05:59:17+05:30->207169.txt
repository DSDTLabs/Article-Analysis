 The second bank then withheld the transfer, following which a 19-year-old, Pravin Shingvan, approached them to find out why the money had not been transferred. Officials of the bank immediately alerted the police who picked him up and interrogated him. Shingvan told police about Kishore's involvement in the scam.
