NEW DELHI: Hours before closing all liquor vends within 500 metres of highways, the   on Friday had ordered opening of liquor shops in three districts of  , home to four important pilgrimage centres, by staying an HC order that had ordered their closure from April 1.

 A bench of Chief Justice JS Khehar and Justice DY Chandrachud stayed a Uttarakhand HC order directing closure of all liquor shops and consumption of intoxicants in Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts of the state, which see footfalls of lakhs of pilgrims visiting the shrines at Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.
 
 However, the SC’s omnibus direction on Friday for closure of liquor vends within 500 metres of national and state highways would apply to Uttarakhand.
 
 Appearing for the state, additional advocate general Mukesh Giri said since 2002 the state has banned sale of liquor within kilometres of the four important shrines at Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath.
 
 He said the nearest liquor shop from Yamunotri is 46 km away at Barkot, from Gangotri 65 km away at Bhatwari, from Kedarnath 73 km away at Ukhimath and from Badrinath 46 km away at Joshimath.
 
 Giri said the HC erred in directing the state “to impose complete prohibition of distribution, collection, sale, purchase or consumption of alcohol/liquor, including beer and intoxicants, in Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Uttarkashi districts from April 1” even when the government had on April 24, 2002 imposed the above mentioned distance restrictions on sale of intoxicants.
 
 He said these directions by the HC were in direct contravention of excise laws and would cause “public exchequer a loss of revenue approximately more than Rs 1600 crore in the financial year 2017-18”.
