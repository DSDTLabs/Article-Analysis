NAVI MUMBAI: It is still two years before the city will get a new civic   but, in the meanwhile, animal welfare groups are struggling to deal with the rising number of ill animals and their treatment. Many have to turn away complicated cases due to lack of manpower and facilities.

 But In Defence of Animals, which operates two sterilisation centres in Navi Mumbai—one in Vashi and the other in Panvel, still manages to perform surgeries despite limited resources. Dr H Ghanwat, who heads IDA, Navi Mumbai, said that the animal hospital will certainly be a boon. “Even though we operate sterilisation centres, we do attend to emergency cases whenever we get them. We have limited space and resources but we try to accommodate any injured animals,” he said.
 
 Radhika Kunte, a volunteer from Kamothe said that there are no hospitals nearby and rescuers are often helpless if there is no vet on hand as the animals suffer. “Navi Mumbai is desperately in need of veterinary hospitals and permanent shelters. Many puppies and paralyzed animals die due to infections in many sterilization centers,” she added.
 
 The new veterinary hospital will be set up by Tata Trusts along with   (PFA).  , legal advisor, PFA, said that the agreement with Cidco states that 50% of the animals will be treated for free or at a deep subsidy. “This hospital will be a not-for-profit institution and treatment will be given to any injured stray.”
