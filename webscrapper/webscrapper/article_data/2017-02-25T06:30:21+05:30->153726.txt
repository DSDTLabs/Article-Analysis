 “Last year was not good in terms of sales. Already it was low and people, both in urban and rural areas, consumed less liquor after the note ban. The department recorded nearly 20% decline in sales,” said an official from the excise department.
 
 “The ongoing agitation against liquors shops, particularly in panchayats, also contributed to it marginally,” the official added. Among other steps to earn revenue, the government has increased   from 6.75% to 10%.
 
 The government has also opted for the lottery system instead of renewing existing licences. For renewing licence, owners will have to shell out 31% to 35% more in 2018-19.
 
 The government has fixed the licence fee at Rs 25 lakh for 2017-18, an increase of Rs 4 lakh from the previous year. In 2018-19, the same fee will go up to Rs 27 lakh. However, 20% of the amount will also be charged as application fee for renewing licences. These rates are applicable for Jaipur and Jodhpur.
