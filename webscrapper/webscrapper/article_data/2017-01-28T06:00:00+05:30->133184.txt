Visakhapatnam: Andhra Pradesh will have a school of excellence and transformation at Amaravati to be established by the Confederation of India Industry. The business school will be developed on the lines of the International School of Business (ISB) located in Hyderabad.

 Interestingly, the ISB in Hyderabad was established during the Chandrababu Naidu regime when he was chief minister of undivided Andhra Pradesh. This was disclosed by AP chief secretary SP Tucker who explained the policy changes taken by the state government during the last two and half years which resulted in double-digit growth for the state.
 
 “The state is advancing at 10.94 per cent annual growth rate and is expected to improve further in the coming years,” said Tucker. According to him, Vision 2029 will transform AP into the best state in the country by 2029.
