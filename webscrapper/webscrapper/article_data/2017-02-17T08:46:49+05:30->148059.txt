MUMBAI: If the   refuses to lend its “support and blessing” to Cricket  's newly-planned cricketing venture - the   - the South African board could “consider” if they should lend support in allowing their cricketers to participate in the IPL.

 It's a big 'if' that CSA's chief executive   is not willing to discuss yet. “I would not want to speculate on outcomes that we have not yet fully considered internally or with the BCCI,” Lorgat told TOI in a chat to discuss CSA's upcoming T20 league for which a tender was floated last week.
 
 The badly bleeding Ram Slam - South Africa's existing domestic T20 league -has taught CSA what not to do when working on a league. “This time, we have done our homework, learning from our own past and other successful leagues around the world,” he said.
 
 The standout for South Africa is a very workable time-zone, one that can cater to prime-time viewership in the Indian sub-continent while also catering to the UK, European and American markets. South Africa has shared a good relationship with India in the past with the latter being the first country to visit them for a cricket series after their Apartheid ban was lifted.
 
 However, Lorgat himself - at a personal level -hasn't always shared a very good relationship with the BCCI establishment. “It would be absolutely beneficial to Cricket South Africa if BCCI extends its support and blessings. We enjoy a good relationship with good relationship with the Indian board, as has been the case in the past ­ except for that one period,” he says.
 
 Which period? “The acrimony that you refer to is water under the bridge. There was a time when the relationship was acrimonious but both the countries have worked through it,” Lorgat said, without going into any further details.
