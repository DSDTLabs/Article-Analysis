BENGALURU:   working in   primary health centre or any other government hospital henceforth have to give medicine of their studies, as per new circular issued by the health department on January 8. The ayurvedic, homeopathy doctors posted in PHCs were so far giving allopathy medicines too and most of them had undergone a short period training in modern medicine. 

 There are over 1,300 Ayush doctors, who are largely ayurveda, homeopathy and unani practitioners working in the government health centres. “They must practice the stream of medicine they have specialized in. The patients who walk into the government health care centre have to be given a choice of medicine,” said health department officials.
