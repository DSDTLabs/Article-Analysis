INDORE: Panic gripped several   and building in   on Monday evening when an   took place in an overhead distribution transformer in the opposite lane of C-21 Mall on the AB Road. No one injured in the incident that took place behind Man   at around 6.00 pm.

 “After hearing a loud noise, I rushed to behind the building to see what had happened and I noticed a light and fire coming out from the transformer. At first I thought that it was some kind of tire burst, but realized that it something different,” said Rohit Sharma, an onlooker. 
 
 Few of the intrepid ones also went to the spot to check what actually happened. “I was curious to see what was the impact of the blast and wanted to check if there is anyone hurt as usually in such incidents. I immediately rushed to the spot and saw that a current transformer was burnt and no one was hurt,” said  , a professional. 
 
 Two vehicles that were parked near the transformer were slightly damaged in the incident when the transformer’s hot oil directly fell on them after it exploded. Hundreds of people come out from their offices and nearby buildings after hearing the explosion. 
 
 A fire brigade was also called, but the fire was already doused before it reached the spot. This also affected power supply in the whole building, and the lift of the building also got stuck. 
 
 Officials said that the transformer had been repaired and maintained recently. “Though the exact cause of the explosion is yet known, but it seems that it was due to overload. Usually the power shedding is done to prevent overload, but during summer seasons, the usage of electricity increases and thus causes overload in distribution and meeting transformers,” said an official of Discom.
