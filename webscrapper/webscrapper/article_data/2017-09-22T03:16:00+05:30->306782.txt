Mapusa: A local Mapusa court has granted conditional anticipatory   to former tourism minister and sitting Congress Tivim MLA Nilkanth Halarnkar, in an alleged land scam case.

 In May 2016, the anti-corruption branch (ACB) had registered an FIR against Halarnkar, former chairperson of the Goa Housing Board (GHB), in connection with a housing project. 
 
 Former GHB managing director and joint secretary, Elvis Gomes, and another were also booked in the case. The ACB had acted on a complaint lodged in February the same year.
 
 Sources said a notice was subsequently issued to Halarnkar to appear before the ACB on December 22, 2016 and that four days later, he had approached the court in Mapusa seeking anticipatory bail. 
 
 Advocate Vinayak Porob, appearing on behalf of the applicant, argued that Halarnkar was innocent and that the FIR was politically motivated to taint his image. While granting conditional anticipatory bail, additional sessions judge at Mapusa Vijaya Pol, directed the investigating officer to give the applicant a 48-hour notice prior to making an arrest, Porob told TOI.
