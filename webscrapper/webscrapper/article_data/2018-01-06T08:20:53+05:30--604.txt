MUMBAI: Members of Shiv Pratishthan, accused of fuelling clashes over commemoration of the Koregaon Bhima battle, refuted allegations by Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh leader Prakash Ambedkar against their leader   of inciting violence, along with Milind Ekbote of  . Former Pune corporator Ekbote has also been named in the FIR over clashes following the Dalit gathering to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle in which Mahar soldiers under the British defeated the upper caste army of the Peshwas. 

 "Guruji (Bhide) is being framed. He was not even in Pune on January 1 when the incident (Koregaon Bhima clashes) occurred. There are fringe elements who are trying to create communal divide in the country," said Dalvi. "We are proud to be a Hindutvavadi organisation, but we are Indians first. We will not do anything which causes communal tension in the state."
 
 Shiv Pratishthan, based in Sangli, has regional offices in Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. "The situation is very murky in Mumbai and we didn't want to further spoil it," said Mumbai chief Dalvi about the postponing of the Lalbaug event. 
 
 The members said all Hindutvavadi organisations in the state are related to them, including Ekbote's Samast Hindu Aghadi and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). "We love the   and hope they share the same feeling for us. We are related to all the organisations that worship Shivaji Maharaj and believe in the saffron flag," said Chetan Bharaskar, a member.
 
 They demanded a fair investigation so that all misunderstandings are cleared and the culprits who orchestrated the riots are brought to book. "We are not running away from the police. Guruji has given his reply to the Sangli police regarding the notice sent to him. Why should we run, we have done nothing wrong," said Bharaskar.
