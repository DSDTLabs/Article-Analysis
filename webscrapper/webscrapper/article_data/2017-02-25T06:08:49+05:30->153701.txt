MYSURU: Though it is still the end of February, and technically winter, Mysureans are bracing for a searing summer. The temperature has already risen to 34 degree Celsius and is expected to cross 36 degree Celsius by the month-end. 

 The mercury reached a record high with 34 degree by noon on February 24, and will reach more than 36 degrees in another two days in the city, as reported by weather forecast authorities. This rise will be the highest in the past five years in the region.
 
 With a shortage of annual rainfall in the past three years and drought looming over the region, summer is approaching early. The season, which used to start from mid-March and stay on till May, is arriving much earlier this year. 
 
 C  , senior superintendent of the Weather Monitoring Cell at the Organic Farm Research Centre of University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) at Naganahalli, said the shortage of annual rainfall in the past few years is causing temperatures to rise in February. 
 
 “Previous year, the temperature was around 31 degree Celsius in February, while this year, the temperature has already gone up to 34 degree. This rise indicates that the temperature will be higher in the coming days and people have to brace for a hotter season,” he said. 
 
 Govindaraju said that generally, there are showers after Shivaratri. “We are expecting 3mm rain in a couple of days. If it rains, the heat will reduce and bring relief to the people,” he said. 
 
 Due to early hot weather, which increases after Shivaratri, people have already started buying umbrellas and wrapping scarves around their faces to beat the heat. 
 
  dermatologist Dr   suggested that people wear full-sleeved and light-coloured attire, and preferably wear caps while out in the sun. Sipping liquids will avoid dehydration, he said.
