Panaji: Two years after the no-fail policy upto Class VIII was introduced in Goa, the state saw a sudden surge in the number of students answering the Class X exams.  In 2012, this led to the Class XI seats fill-up within two days, sending the others scampering around for seats. For the first time after five years, Goa is unlikely see such an excess of students for higher secondary school admissions. The number of students that have answered the state board Class X exam this year stands at around 19,337, which is down by almost 1,500 since last year. In March 2016, 20,814 students had appeared for the Class X examinations. Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education is still trying to ascertain the reason for this sudden drop in the number of students, board chairperson Jose Remedios Rebello said. Besides the overall numbers being down, the directorate of education (DoE) has already taken measures to ensure that no students are left without a Class XI seat, after the fiasco during the last few years. “We have set up three counters at the north zone, south zone and central zone education offices. Students who do not get admissions can register their names here and we will place them in a college,” director of education G P Bhat said. The Class X results will be declared on May 25. A rising Class X pass percentage was also leading to higher number of students seeking higher secondary school admissions.  A higher secondary school in Margao shutting down and Class X pass-outs from other boards seeking admissions to state board schools for Class XI was also leading to worsening of the situation. But with the number of those answering the Class X exams dropping the state is unlikely to see the desperate rush that students experienced over the last few years, which was leading to last minute demands by higher secondary schools to increase the seats.
