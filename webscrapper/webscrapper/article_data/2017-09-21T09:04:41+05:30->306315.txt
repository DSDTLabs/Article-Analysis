SANGRUR: Following a clash between the police and farmers in   town of   district on Tuesday, police have registered a case against 40 persons in the matter. The case was registered on Tuesday night after which a crackdown had been launched to arrest those booked by the police. 

 At least six persons, including the Longowal station house officer (SHO) and a munshi, were injured in the farmer-police clash when the cops had gone to Longowal to arrest farmer leaders in view of the September 22 protest call given by seven peasant organisations. 
 
 The cops said the farmers had tried to prevent them from discharging their duties and pelted stones on them from roof tops while the farmers alleged that the police had harassed women protesters.
 
 Following police action, a large number of farmers had staged a protest in Longowal on Wednesday alleging that they were being been implicated in false cases. A police team led by Longowal SHO Vijay Kumar along with munshi Hardev Singh had gone to the houses of BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) leaders Ranjit Singh and Gurmale Singh in Wadiani Patti village to arrest them, but they were not found in their homes.
 
 A number of leaders of different farmer outfits also reached Longowal and joined the protest. They claimed that the government was using state machinery to foil their five-day protest starting September 22.
 
 Confirming the development, Sunam deputy superintendent of police (DSP) William Jeji said those booked had attacked a police team gone to conduct some investigations.
 
 Meanwhile, president of   Satnam Singh Behru said instead of promoting confrontation between farmers and state agencies, chief minister Amarinder Singh should invite farm leaders for talks to resolve the stalemate and ease tension that was building up in the region.
