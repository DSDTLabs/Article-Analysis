CHANDIGARH: A seminar on the theme ‘Minimum medicine maximum Health’ for the senior citizens’ will be held at the Mahatma Gandhi State Institute of Public Administration,   on Monday. The idea behind the seminar is to look at ways to improve the healthcare system in the country by presenting a new affordable model.

 Dr R Kumar, president of ‘Society for promotion of ethical and affordable   care said, “This can be achieved by developing a ‘culture of health’, against the culture of disease which prevails currently. The seminar will provide an opportunity to consult the civil society through convergence of administrators, media, doctors, jurists and eminent citizens. The seminar will make recommendations to the Government of India on how with limited resources, one can achieve good health and thus reduce the need for higher budget, more doctors or hospitals.”
 
 In the first session, speakers will dwell on issues like healthy life style, media hype against doctors and others. Consumer Protection Act and the Clinical Establishment Act have proved counterproductive in providing proper patient care. Other topics include how to reduce the role of doctors by developing a health culture.
 
 In the second session, top government officials from the Punjab and Union governments would apprise the audience of various issues related to welfare of senior citizens.
