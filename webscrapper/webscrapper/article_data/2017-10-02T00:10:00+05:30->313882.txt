Indore: The district   of Indore has been struggling with numerous   from students, parents, teachers and other employees of the department.

 Ranging from complaints of corporal punishment in classroom by teachers to teachers deducting the marks of students in examination purposely, the education department gets hundreds of complaints at its Mhow Naka office every week. The office received nearly 200 complaints every week through mediums like, public hearing and CM helpline and directly.
 
 But, when the department acts on the complaints and investigates the cases, maximum number of them are found fake, said officials. “Through the mediums of CM helpline and public hearing we get a number of complaints on a regular basis and these are looked into on a priority basis. But unfortunately most complaints turn out to be false once the matter is inquired,” said Indore district education officer SS Kaushal.
 
  “Many complainants come with a motive and try to blow up the matter even when the issue is very petty. In these cases we have to give a warning to such complainants since it is a time consuming process to solve the complaints,” added Kaushal. 
 
 The department is not only struggling with the false complaints, but also grappling with poorly trained   in terms of computer knowledge.
 
 Sources from the education department claimed that the department employees have been taking a lot of time in completing the online procedures for problem solving through the mediums of public hearing and CM helpline, which has led to delay in other routine works in the department. 
 
 “The routine work suffers as we have to divert the available staff towards solving these complaints since we have a staff crunch. And false complaints add to our woes.” said Kaushal. 
 
 Owing to the strict monitoring and response for public hearing and CM helpline complaints, the department is forced to solve the issues on priority basis and report back to the authorities concerned.
