NEW DELHI: Dense   returned to the capital on Sunday night, hampering operations of outbound flights at   for over 12 hours. As the authorities were forced to implement low-visibility procedures, 139 flights got delayed and eight were cancelled. The schedule of over 60 trains also got affected while one train was cancelled due to the adverse weather conditions.

 The runway visual range (RVR) at IGI stayed below 50 metres for close to five hours between 4am and 9am on Monday, leading to implementation of CAT-III procedures. IGI Airport is CAT-3B compliant, which allows pilots to land even when visibility is close to 50 metres.
 
 Dense fog started descending on the city from Sunday night, forcing the airport authorities to take safety precautions from 8.35pm. According to IGI officials, low-visibility procedures were enforced at 11.26pm on Sunday and were lifted after around 13 hours at 12.01pm on Monday when visibility crossed 600 metres, said an official.
 
 The delays and cancellations stranded passengers for a long period, with many taking to social media to vent their frustration. Several airlines also used social media to inform flyers about the disruption and request them to check   timings before leaving for the airport.
 
 The fog also affected the running of trains with over 35 arriving late and 28 getting rescheduled. The Jaisalmer-Kathgodam-Ranikhet Express was cancelled due to the fog and officials said such delays might continue in the next few days.
 
 “The worst fog of the season has passed, but we are still prepared to tackle such situations. The drivers have been asked to stay alert. Passengers are requested to check their train timings well in advance as fog is likely to persist for the next few days,” said a railway official.
