HYDERABAD: A 45-year-old woman from the city who was allegedly treated like a slave by her husband in Pakistan has been rescued and will return from Lahore on Wednesday. MBT leader,  , pursued the case with the external affairs minister and the High Commission as the woman's husband was not allowing her to return. She eventually got a visa and Ajmed Ullah Khan sent her a flight ticket. 

  TOI highlighted the problem of Mohammadia Begum on January 7, 2017 following which Union external affairs minister   asked   in Pakistan to provide help. 
 
 About 21-years-ago, Mohammadia Begum, a resident of New Mohammednagar, Bandlaguda, was allegedly tricked into marriage with Mohammed Younis. The nikah was performed over a call with the man in Oman. After Mohammadia Begum went to Oman, she realised the man was a Pakistan national. He took her to Pakistan. While four children were born to them in  , one more child was born after she was taken to Pakistan. Her Indian passport and visa expired. 
 
 In Pakistan, the husband started ill-treating her and married another woman in Oman. With Amjed Ullah Khan writing repeatedly to Sushma Swaraj to help Mohammadia Begum, she was provided a visa. The husband then refused to send her saying he will not bear the ticket expenditure. 
 
 Amjed Ullah Khan who provided the ticket said Mohammadia Begum will reach Delhi from Lahore on Wednesday afternoon and reach Hyderabad in the evening. He thanked Sushma Swaraj and the Indian High Commission for the help in rescuing her and facilitating her return.
