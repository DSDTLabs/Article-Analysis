NEW DELHI: A Hyderabad court's decision to grant bail to   in the 2007   blast case has come as a setback to NIA to secure his conviction in a terror case.

 The   (NIA) had on Thursday opposed his bail petition in the 2007 case, submitting that it had ample evidence to prove his guilt “beyond all reasonable doubt“.
 
 Seeking denial of bail to accused Nabakumar Sarkar alias Swami Aseemanand, NIA argued that the delayed trial in the case, resulting in his long incarceration, or his age at 66 years was not valid ground for granting him bail, contrary to the contentions made in the bail petition.
 
 NIA stated that the Mecca Masjid blast case trial was at a decisive stage and granting bail to   at this juncture would run the risk of his trying to influence the nearly 134 witnesses yet to be examined by the court.
 
 Aseemanand's bail in Mecca Masjid blast case has paved the way for his freedom as he had earlier secured bail in the   blast case and was also acquitted in the   blasts case on March 8.In fact, the fourth metropolitan sessions judge at Hyderabad, while allowing his bail application on Thursday , cited his bail in Samjhauta train bombing case and acquittal in Ajmer Sharif blast case.
 
 This was despite NIA's quoting sub-section 5 of Section 43 D of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) to get the judge to deny bail. The section states that no person accused of an offence under Chapter IV and VI of UAPA (both dealing with terrorism) shall be released on bail or his own bond if the court, on a perusal of the case diary or the report made under Section 173 of CrPC is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true.
 
 NIA argued that the court, while framing charges based on report filed under Section 173 of CrPC, had found the accusations against Aseemanand to be prima facie true.
 
 An NIA officer said that they were yet to study the order and take a call on whether to challenge it.
