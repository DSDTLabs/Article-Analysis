 On January 5, police recovered five M18A1 directional anti-personnel Claymore mines from the river and later on Thursday, the special squad recovered around 500 self-loading rifle bullets and pulse generator connectors from the same spot where the directional anti-personnel Claymore mines were found. After National Security Guards (NSG) confirmed that the mines were 'live' and issued by the  , the police sought assistance from the army's technical teams to unravel the mystery in Kuttippuram.
 
 Talking over the phone from Pune, Abraham said that police are mainly examining the history of recovered ammo such as manufacturing date and year, distribution and the chain of the custody.
 
 "A preliminary examination of the batch numbers of the recovered mines showed that they were distributed to Chandigarh army unit in Punjab. We can confirm the details only after verifying the documents at different army units. It is not an easy process and examination of documents (related to the arms manufacturing) during various periods, will take time," he said.
