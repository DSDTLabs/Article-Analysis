Over 9,117 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in 10 high-priority districts and three tribal districts got treatment at their homes, the health department officials claimed.

 The state has malnutrition treatment centres (MTCs) in different districts of the state. But, incidences are frequently reported of children not staying at MTCs because of loss of wages of their parents. To deal with the problem, the National Health Mission had launched the CMAM aiming to provide food rich in   at doorsteps of beneficiaries two years ago. The health department provided ready-to-use vitamin-enriched food to 1574 villages of 13 districts in first phase of CMAM. 
 
 Now, health department claimed that with the innovative CMAM, they have improved the condition of 9,117 SAM children. They are not SAM children any more, officials claimed. 
 
 Officials said that the government will launch the same programme in seven new districts with the help of international development partners such as UNICEF and GAIN.
