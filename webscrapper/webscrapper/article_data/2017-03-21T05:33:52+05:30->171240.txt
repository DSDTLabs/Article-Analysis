NEW DELHI: Counter-terrorism cooperation, counter radicalisation and maritime will be in focus when India hosts the meeting of the national security advisers and security chiefs of   countries here on Tuesday, taking the first steps towards building a security architecture for the   region.

 Led by National Security Advisor  , the meeting will deliberate on a host of security issues including the festering Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, which has seen terror groups like Lashkar-e-Toiba and   trying to radicalise them. This has also led to tensions between   and Bangladesh. It is of con cern to India which doesn't want to see another radicalised group on its eastern flank, ready to cause damage to the three countries.
 
 Bangladesh has become a front-line state in the battle against Islamic terrorism which, if unchecked, could have security implications across the region. Therefore, counter-radicalisation programmes and cooperation are assuming greater importance. India has also promised to hold the first counter-radicalisation conference for the region in the coming months.
 
 The idea of the security meet was mooted during the BRICS-BIMSTEC summit in Goa in 2016. India considers Bay of Bengal as an important economic and strategic space and security challenges in this region have assumed greater importance. The Bay of Bengal sits in the centre of sea lanes of communication and trade and energy routes. It has assumed greater importance after India decided to develop its eastern seaboard with its ambitious `Sagar Mala' project. All of these put security issues in sharp focus.
 
 China's growing power play in the South Asian region and   has made it imperative for India to engage the countries in the neighbourhood in a security conversation that takes New Delhi's security interests on board, while enabling them to deal with their own emerging security challenges.
