THANE: Activists and residents have asked the   Municipal Corporation (TMC) to adopt a more systematized mechanism in the annual survey to identify and classify dilapidated structures. 

 The suggestions came up after it was revealed that the two   buildings, which   in a span of two weeks were not listed as dangerous. 
 
 It may be recalled that TMC had faced a similar complaint when Krishna Niwas building in Naupada that collapsed in August 2015 was also not listed as unstable. On the other hand, a reportedly fit structure adjoining the building featured in the ‘dangerous’ list. 
 
 The civic body conducts an annual survey of the nearly 1.5 lakh structures and classifies them in various categories based on the damage to the core structure. A panel is deputed for the task and the report is made public by May every year for execution, said civic officials. Structures that are 25 years and above are asked to get a stability certificate from a specially designated panel of auditors. Activists and residents complain that such an erroneous   could prove fatal. Officials, meanwhile, said they ask for audits and if it is unavailable, a team of civil engineers visually scrutinizes the buildings and classifies them accordingly.
 
 “Such surveys seem to be done randomly often by junior officers. The TMC has to explain why such errors are found in classification of the structures,” complained Pradeep Indulkar, an activist from Thane.
 
 Deputy municipal commissioner Ashok Burpulle clarified, “We never indiscriminately certify structures. A notice is sent to residents of structures beyond 25 years of age as per our record to get an audit done and submit the same with the ward office. If there is no compliance, our panel of experienced civil engineers visit the structure and after relevant inspections certify the stability of the buildings. There is no question of haphazardness in this issue.”
