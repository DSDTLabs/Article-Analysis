Coimbatore: City police have sent samples collected from the decomposed body of a man that was recovered from a well at Vellalore last Friday, to the forensic sciences department in Chennai for DNA test. Police believe the victim to be 25-year-old V Vignesh of Sulur, who had gone missing on April 3. “He was working in a jewellery shop at Karuppanna Gounder Street. Sulur police had registered a case after he failed to return home on April 3. We had arrested Vignesh’s friend N Ragunathan of Ondipudur in connection with the case,” a police officer said.  Police believe Ragunathan stabbed Vignesh to death and dumped the body in the well following an alcohol-fuelled quarrel. TNN
