PATNA: The Bihar State Power (Holding) Company Ltd (BSPHCL) and   (PESU) are bracing up for smooth power supply in the state capital in the upcoming  , including Durga Puja, which would start from September 20.
 
    said all maintenance works would be completed by next Wednesday for unhindered power supply during Durga Puja, Diwali and Chhath. He said maintenance works would not be undertaken on weekends to avoid inconvenience to the residents.
  
  “Apart from  , we are installing additional separators and pruning trees close to overhead wires in different parts of the city. Separate lines are being provided for the Puja pandals,” Singh said.
  
  Asked about the availability of power during the festival, Singh said: “The daily demand of power in Patna is around 490MW and it being met completely. Besides, the power demand in Patna normally plunges during the festivals as many people go to their native places.”
  
  The maintenance works have, however, irked residents in several parts of the city. “Power supply seems to have become erratic lately. There have been frequent short-duration power cuts for the past few days,” said Anuj Parashar of Nehru Nagar.
  
  However, PESU GM said power supply was not disrupted for more than one hour for maintenance works. “We have a strong distribution network wherein power supply is made through alternate feeders or additional transformers recently installed across the city to ensure that power supply does not get disrupted for long in case of maintenance or breakdowns.”
  
  Singh also appealed the Puja committees to take proper power connection to illuminate their pandals, else strict action would be taken for any power theft.
