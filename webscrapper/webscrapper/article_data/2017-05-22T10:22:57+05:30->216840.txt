PUNE:   showed the way last week. It is time for the rest in the   Parivahan Mahamandal Limited ( ) to follow the leader. 

 The transport utility is working on a module that will see its senior officials boarding buses once or twice a week and interact with passengers to know their grievances and look for solutions — a model set in place by Mundhe, the chief managing director of the PMPML. 
 
 Mundhe had on Friday taken bus rides along BRTS corridors in areas such as Katraj, Hadapsar, Yerwada, Sangamwadi and Vishrantwadi. The “unannounced inspection” had caught many on the wrong foot. As many as 16 PMPML employees faced action in the form of suspension, one-day without pay and fines.
 
 “The CMD has shown the way and it needs to be followed. The new drive will start soon and and its strategy is being planned. Several aspects have to be kept in mind before implementing it,” a senior PMPML official told TOI. 
 
 Another official said, “The drive will not be announced in advance. The surprise element is most important as the officials will then come to know about the attitude of the drivers and conductors and the condition of buses. Besides, the officials will carry out the drive on buses across routes. The CMD is interested in its implementation.” 
 
 He added, “The drive will be befecial for the passengers as they can directly talk to the officials, and vice versa. This will ensure improve people’s trust and confidence in the PMPML.
 
 Commuters are also happy with the PMPML’s move. “Whenever we have complaints, we have to either call up the PMPML or send text messages. Many people don’t know how to raise  . If the PMPML carries out the sudden inspections, the passengers can interact with the senior officials of the transport body,” said  , a Kondhwa resident.
