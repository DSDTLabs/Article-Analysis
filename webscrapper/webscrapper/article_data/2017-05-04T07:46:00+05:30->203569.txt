Amritsar: Khalsa College here will conduct annual exams for various courses from May 9. The college management had cancelled the exams earlier following protests from students after an agriculture sciences student Harpreet Singh committed suicide on being barred from taking the practical exam due to attendance shortage.

 The college management said that 161 students debarred from taking exams would take remedial classes from May 4 to 7 to become eligible for the examination. On the other hand, normalcy returned to the campus with cops still at guard to avoid any incident of mischief. 
 
 Students from various departments came to inquire about their roll numbers on Wednesday while many had come to clear subject-related doubts with teachers. “I was part of the agitation for just one day after which my parents asked me to concentrate on my studies. I wish no such agitation takes place on our campus in future,” said a student pursuing graduation in humanities.
