A few months ago, the new   film 'Sakhavu' was in the news for apparently damaging the premises of Kottayam Medical College.

 The film's producer Rakesh Bahuleyan recently told media that the allegations are totally baseless. He said that the crew had deposited Rs. 15000 per day for the shoot, though as per government regulations the amount is only Rs. 5000. "When Youth Congress members marched to the hospital protesting against our shoot, we decided to pay the bigger sum as we didn't want to create further issues. The only change we made to the premises was painting another color to a few areas. Soon after the shoot, we repainted the section as well. We aren't sure why these allegations are surfacing, months after the shoot," said the producer.
 
 The film is expected to hit theatres soon and has Nivin Pauly in the role of a student leader.
