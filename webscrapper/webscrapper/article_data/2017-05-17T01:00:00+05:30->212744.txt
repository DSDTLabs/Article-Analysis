 Earlier, SSP Garima Malik had asked all the SHOs of the municipal area police stations to identify potential troublemakers in their respective jurisdiction in order to ensure fair and peaceful election. The SSP had subsequently written to the DM for action against these people perceived to be a threat to peace in the town.
 
 According to the DM, the 37 people have been given two days’ time to explain why they should not be externed from the district till the election is over. A final decision will be taken after giving a hearing to the notice recipients, the DM told this correspondent on Tuesday and added the list was not final and more externment notices might be issued.
