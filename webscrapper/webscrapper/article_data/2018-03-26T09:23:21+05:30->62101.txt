  : Summer has set in and nothing now makes the zoo animals happy than having a gala time in water. The zoo has started following summer protocol and the big cats are mostly chilling under the sprinklers to beat the scorching heat. 

  Jamuna was seen soothing herself under a sprinkler on Sunday while the visitors waited in the hot sun just to get a glimpse of her. But with a care to give an appearance, the big cat was seen basking around in a damp area under the sprinkler. The other animals too are having a similar water addiction.
 
 "There is a summer protocol that we follow every year for all the cages and the work is almost done. For different animals we provide different external coolants," said curator and education officer at the zoo, Nihar Parulekar.
 
 He added that the animals are given required multi-vitamin supplement and glucose so that they don't get dehydrated. Also, the small mammals are fed milk and curd. During  , the reptiles tend to eat more. "We make sure to feed them at appropriate intervals. Besides, there are instructors and keepers to inspect the health of animals," he said.
 
 While lion and tigers have got three sprinklers in their cage that opens two times a day, the cages of small mammals and birds have traditional wet village carpet made of hay on three sides. Zoo keeper  , who deals with the big carnivores said, "They enjoy sitting and playing under the sprinklers during summers. We also try to make some areas as damp as possible and in some cages we will keep coolers so that even during the peak of summers, the cages remain cool."
