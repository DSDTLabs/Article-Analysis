LUCKNOW: Bollywood stars may soon be seen shooting on the premises of Lucknow   stations or even inside the trains. With   evincing interest in shooting on Metro trains and stations, the Lucknow Municipal Rail Corporation (LMRC) is planning to draft a policy in this regard. The policy will be modelled on the rules framed by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation ( ) for celluloid shooting. These would include booking fee of Rs 1 lakh per hour, security deposit, indemnity bond, and other terms and conditions.

 â€œAt present, we cannot say how much time it would take to draft the policy , but we have started studying the policies drafted by DMRC and other Metro corporations," said LMRC managing director Kumar Keshav.
 
 Metro officials shared they were approached by producers of Ajay Devgn and Ileana D'Cruz starrer 'Raid', which will be shot extensively in Lucknow. But the permission was not granted due to absence of a film policy for Metro stations. According to state information department, the makers of `Bareilly ki Barfi' had also approached LMRC in January this year. But the go-ahead for shooting was not given because LMRC neither had clearance certificate from the Commissioner of Metro Rail Safety , nor the no-objection certificate from fire safety department at that time. LMRC also plans to take actor   on a Metro ride when he visits the city next month.
