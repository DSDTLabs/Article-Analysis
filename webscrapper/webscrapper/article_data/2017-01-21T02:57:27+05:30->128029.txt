NEW DELHI: Union minister for sports   and Dangal actor   exchanged polite but edgy tweets on hijab on Friday. 

 The exchange started when   posted a picture from an art exhibition. It showed a painting of two women; one with a partially veiled face, another trapped in a cage. “This painting tells a story similar to @zairawasim, pinjra tod kar humari betiyan badhne lagi hain aage (Our daughters are breaking out of cages to forge ahead). More power to our daughters!”
 
 After Goel’s initial tweet,   responded saying: “Sir, with all respect to you, I feel I must disagree. I request you not to connect me to such a discourteous depiction.” Goel replied, “You have interpreted wrong. I appreciated your work and stated that evil and patriarchal notions must be discouraged.” Over two tweets, Wasim wrote back: “Women in hijab are beautiful and free. Moreover, the story depicted through this painting is not even remotely relevant to mine.”
 
 Goel courteously closed the conversation with: “I’m afraid you still haven’t understood. But I wish you all the very best and appreciate your work. Hope to meet & interact too.”
