BHOPAL: Winter hasn’t been this warm in January in Bhopal in a long time. The minimum temperature in the city on Thursday was 15 degrees Celsius — five degrees above normal. And the day was hot at 28.3 degrees — three degrees higher than normal.

 But the good news is that winter isn’t gone. The chill will be back when a weather phenomenon over the   desert that is making Bhopal sweat dissipates.
 
 A sudden surge in temperature was seen in many parts of the state, thanks to the cycer over west Rajasthan, but some places, like  , continue to reel under biting cold. In Bhopal, people were seen moving around in cottons. Just about a week ago, the mercury had plunged to the shivering sevens. Even on Wednesday night, the minimum was 10.7 degrees — the next night it jumped 5 degrees. The day temperature on Wednesday was 27.3 degrees — a degree less than Thursday’s.
 
  said the rise in temperature was due to a change in wind direction. The cycer is expected to subside in a day or two after which the temperatures would dip again, he said. Winter is very much around, seeing that Umaria is shivering at 3degrees, he pointed out.
 
 It’s a warm forecast for Bhopal on Friday — 28 degrees and 14 degrees. But a cold wave warning is issued for Rewa, Sagar and Shahdol divisions.
