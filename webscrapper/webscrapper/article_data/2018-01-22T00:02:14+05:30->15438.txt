Kolhapur: Activists demanding removal of priests from Mahalaxmi temple are going to take their demands to the state level by organising public meetings at various places. The decision was taken in a meeting organised by a new forum named ‘Ambabai Mukti Andolan Sangharsh Samiti'. The forum will contain activists and progressive leaders from across the state. Activists and devotees have already formed the ‘Pujari Hatao Sangharsh Samiti’ which recently met district guardian minister Chandrakant Patil. He assured to bring in an ordinance before March for state-appointment of priests. The newly formed forum will have former justice P B Sawant, social activist A H Salunkhe and other eminent personalities associated with progressive movements from across the state. The first meeting of the new forum will take place at Pune. The date of the meeting will be announced later. Activist Bharat Patankar said, “The state government should not delay bringing the ordinance and pass the law as early as possible. We want the priests removed. We will continue our agitation peacefully.” The guardian minister had stated there are technical issues which have obstructed the state government from drafting a law. Earlier the minister had promised to pass the law during the winter session on similar lines of Pandharpur temple and Shirdi's Sai temple. Activists allege that the government favours the priests as they have been associated for a long time with the party in power. Recently the priests demanded intervention of the chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. Sourabh Khedekar of Sambhaji Brigade said, “Ambabai is the goddess of farmers and the poor. She should be freed from the priests. We will call a public meeting in Pune soon. Devotees of the goddess are spread across the state and we will garner their support to press our demand.”
