MANIPAL: The demonetisation policy is a monumental blunder in the context of short-term effects on economy and also on individual human beings as well, said  , MP and chairman of the   on External Affairs.

 Tharoor, who was in Manipal to attend an event speaking to TOI said that many have lost their lives due to this ‘great’ move by Prime Minister  . Some have even died of hunger and standing on long queues at banks.
 
 Tharoor further added, "There was only 4 per cent of cash to replace on the day of announcement of demonetisation. It violates the solemn oath printed on the note that promises to pay the bearers by denying people withdraw own money. It is one disaster after another, started shifting from one goal post to another. First one want to attack black money then you realise that black money turning white in banks, then start talk about counterfeiting. Ironically, terrorists are caught with new currency in their hands.”
 
 Criticising the new tune of the government on ‘cashless economy’ he said: “May be good objective but our digital infrastructure needs revamp. Half of India is unbanked, many people have no access to electricity and internet. There are no POS readers everywhere in country. How can we go cashless when we are not prepared for it?. It is like taking out 86 per cent of blood supply from individual’s body, ask him/her not only to walk but also do Bharatanatyam. That’s what cashless economy is. The government has inflicted pain upon common people. It is surprising that no one has raised voice against this.”
