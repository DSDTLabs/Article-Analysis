LUCKNOW: Many   who wrote their mathematics examination on Wednesday complained of a wrong question, in addition to the paper being lengthy. According to ISC student Ashneet Wadhwa, the   paper was extremely lengthy, direct but difficult. “There was one question that was wrong, and we spent a lot of time solving it only before we realised there is some error,’’ she said.

 Utkarsh Singh of St Francis’ College, an ISC school, seconded Ashneet and said, “Our entire class spent time solving the question with the wrong equation.’’ 
 
 ISC cocordinator Geetika Kapoor, however said, there were no official complaint of any wrong question so far.
 
 Meanwhile,   class XII students were seen celebrating as one of the toughest papers was over. “Many questions were repeated from previous years papers, and numericals were easy too,” said Animesh Rajpoot of Kendriya Vidhyalaya. Most students found the paper easy and “well-balanced”, with numerical and theoretical questions. Sonalisa Srivastava was relieved as there were no lengthy questions.
