PUNE: Tension prevailed in Ahmednagar city, about 120km from here, on Friday over alleged derogatory remarks passed by deputy mayor  . Chhindam, who represents   in the elected civic body, was arrested later in the night by the Ahmednagar police.

 Ahmednagar corporator and   member Dilip Satpute lodged a complaint against Chhindam with the police. Irate members from different political parties and organizations ransacked the BJP’s Ahmednagar city office located near Gandhi Maidan as well as Chhindam’s house and office.
 
 Chhindam has been booked under sections 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 298 (uttering words with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person) of the IPC.
 
 Meanwhile,   chief and MP Dilip Gandhi on Friday evening told mediapersons that Chhindam has been dismissed from the party.
 
 In his complaint, Satpute said that he received an audio clip on his cellphone on Friday morning in which Chhindam was scolding an employee of the municipal corporation for not doing his work properly. When the employee told him that he would complete the work after Shiv Jayanti (which falls on Monday), Chhindam resorted to a derogatory tirade. Someone recorded Chhindam’s remarks on a cell phone and the clip soon went viral. Satpute, who received the audio clip, stated in his police complaint, “Chhindam’s language has hurt my religious feelings and sentiments.” A video too started circulating later on mobile messaging service in which Chhindam was seen offering an apology for saying objectionable things without any intention.
 
 Ahmednagar police inspector Abhay Parmar told TOI that barring a few cases of stone pelting, there were no untoward incidents. “People calmed down following the immediate arrest of the suspect,” he said. Meanwhile, members of over 10 Hindu organisations demanded registration of an offence against Chhindam.
