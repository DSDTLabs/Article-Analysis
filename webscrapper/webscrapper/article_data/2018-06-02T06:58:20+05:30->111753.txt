CHENNAI: Following the three hottest days of the year, the temperatures in the city on Friday dropped by 3°C. 

 
 Weathermen said the temperature would remain normal or below normal, around 37°C, over the weekend. The weather is set to turn sticky and humid, causing sweating for longer duration, as the onset of sea breeze is delayed by two hours in June compared to May.
 
 Warm westerly winds blowing from the   are growing in strength with the arrival of the southwest monsoon. The gusting westerlies have begun to delay the onset of the cooler easterlies from the sea. Humidity rises with increase of moisture in the air. "Sea breeze brings in moisture but also provides winds that help ease the sweating. To make use of these winds, residents must ensure cross-ventilation inside homes," said former deputy director general of Regional Meteorological Centre Y E A Raj.
 
 During May, on average, the sea breeze arrives in the city by 12.30pm and prevails for around 13 hours. In June it arrives around 2.20pm and persists for 10 hours. On Friday, sea breeze entered the city at 2.45pm when the temperature was around 35°C. By around 6pm, sea breeze cooled the city down to 32°C.
 
 Moisture in the sea breeze, however, increases the relative humidity from 60% at 2.45pm to 70% by 6pm. The   observatory at   is shielded from direct heat and hence reflects the heat a resident would feel inside the house. 
 
 "The temperature out on the road is higher but free-flowing winds help cope with sweating. Indoors, residents will have to ensure wind flow so that sweat evaporates faster," Raj said. 
 
 The   on Friday was 36.2°C (1.3°C below normal). On Saturday, the sky is likely to be partly cloudy, which may help keep the temperature in check. The met office has not predicted rainfall in the city for the next two days.
