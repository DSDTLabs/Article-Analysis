Shimla: Officials of the state government and the National Highways Authority of India met in Mandi on Saturday, following directions of the Himachal Pradesh high court.

 The meeting was convened for preparing a chart in a tabulated form with respect to the status of construction of the Kiratpur-Manali highway. During a hearing on Friday, a division bench of Chief Justice (acting) Sanjay Karol and Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan directed that report be submitted in a tabulated form with respect to the highway from Kiratpur to Manali before the next hearing on May 2.
 
 The direction had come after the court found variation in respect to the status of the cases â€” be it for verification of structures, passing of awards, disbursement of amount, or identification of additional land and initiation of proceedings with respect thereto.
 
 Additional advocate general J K Verma had stated in court that within two weeks all cases pending verification for valuation shall be completed and after verification returned to NHAI.
