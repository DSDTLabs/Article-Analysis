CHENNAI: The   that made their journey all the way from New York to Chennai last year are now on display at the   Trust (MCBT). They were acquired from the   zoo as part of an exchange programme.

 “We sent 12 juvenile gharials to the Bronx zoo. The Komodo dragons were flown down in April 2016 along with their keeper, who stayed with us for two weeks and helped us learn how to care for them,” says  , goodwill ambassador, MCBT. 
 
 The three four-years-old Komodo dragons — two males and one female — are open to public viewing since Wednesday, though only one at a time will be exhibited. These are the first Komodo dragons(Varanus komodoensis) to be brought to the country, said Allwin  , assistant director, MCBT. 
 
 Indigenous to Indonesia, the largest living lizards, they can grow up to 10ft and weight up to 70kg. “Several zoos across the world have reported parthenogenesis, wherein the female can lay fertile eggs without being in contact with a male,” says Jesudasan.
 
 Though four Komodos were acquired, one male didn’t survive. “They were placed under quarantine, and we also had to get them acclimatised,” says Jesudasan, adding that they also required some training. 
 
 The enclosures of the lizards, sponsored by Cholamandalam investment and finance company, has been designed like their natural habitat. “We have given a temperature gradient, so the Komodos can choose whether to be in the shade or bask in the sun. So we have a pit outside and a room it can access apart from a pond,” says Jesudasan.
 
 “Komodos are great crowd-pullers, so we are using it to draw people’s attention to lesser known Indian species such as the red-crowned roofed turtle, which is critically endangered,” says Jesudasan.
