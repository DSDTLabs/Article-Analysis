HYDERABAD: Colleges and   (JNTU) have yet again locked horns over   arrears as the latter has issued a strong-worded letter to the   to clear the dues by March 15.

 The common service fee is collected by colleges during admission as an infrastructural fee under which stationery, hall tickets and other developmental facilities are provided to students. While this fee, until 2011, was part of the   reimbursement scheme, it was later withdrawn unceremoniously. This has resulted in severe battle between the university and colleges.
 
 In a recent notice issued to the colleges, the university has asked all colleges to clear the arrears. “The managementsprincipals of the affiliated colleges are hereby informed that in spite of several reminders, some of the colleges have not cleared the dues of affiliation fee and common service fee till now.As the affiliation inspections for 2017-2018 will be commence from March 15, 2017, the colleges are hereby instructed to clear the dues immediately , otherwise it will be viewed very seriously by the university,“ states the notice.
 
 This is not the first notice that the university has sent out to the colleges. The issue has been the bone of contention between colleges and the university for a long time now. “The dues are to the tune of Rs 75 crore. It is high time that the colleges pay up the dues to avoid further action by the university ,“ said N Yadaiah, registrar of JNTUH, refusing to disclose if non-payment of dues will directly impact the inspections for affiliation process.
 
 However, college management opine that the state government has not cleared the fee reimbursement dues since academic year 2015-16 due to which they are not in position to pay arrears. Others fear that the outstanding dues, if not cleared in time, may lead to withdrawal of affiliations by the university.
