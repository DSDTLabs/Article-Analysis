Margao: Condemning the remarks of Vijai Sardesai independent MLA from Fatordaagainst reservation, the   (FBCC) sought his apology terming his concern for the Bahujan community as a ‘farce’, and said that it exposed him as anti-Bahujan. 

 FBCC president Joseph Silva said that Sardesai was recently quoted in a section of the media saying that due to reservation, students belonging to Saraswat community had faced injustice and were therefore leaving the country. He had also urged the community to look into the issue. 
 
 Silva challenged the ST (scheduled tribe) cell of  , of which Vijai Sardesai is now a member, to publicly reiterate his statements or condemn them. 
 
 Silva was speaking to the media along with former   (MMC) chairperson Piedade Noronha and   who demanded that he apologize for his statements against reservation which has hurt the sentiments of the tribal and backward community across Goa. 
 
 “We would like to inform the MLA that this country runs on everyone’s taxes and therefore, all communities should have adequate representation in all government and educational institutions. For that purpose, reservation was implemented. If Sardesai believes that reservation for our tribal and backward community has deprived his community, he should have demanded more colleges for students in the last four years,” said the Fatorda Congress leaders.
