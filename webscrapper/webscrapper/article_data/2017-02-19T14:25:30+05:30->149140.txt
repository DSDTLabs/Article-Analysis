INDORE: For  , a Class VIII student from Government School Number 30, Aranya nagar, it was the best class she had ever attended as she got a chance to learn from district collector, P Narahari who was in her class to teach students on Saturday.

 It wasn’t a good day just for her. Class VI student   of the same school, who had DIG   as her teacher for one period shared the same thought.
 
 The scene was the same at over 1,705 government primary and middle schools in the city where government officials, administrators, public representatives, doctors, engineers, teachers, housewives and college students reached their selected government schools to inculcate a passion for reading among school students under the ‘Mil Banche MP’ programme (Let MP read together).
 
 Roshini and Teena along with other students of the school echoed that they wanted these guests to visit the school regularly as they got to learn a lot apart from what’s in their books.
 
 “We got to learn about personality development and all round development from Collector sir today. He taught us the meaning of all round development through sports and other co-curricular activities. It was a fun class indeed and all of us wish he comes to teach us again,” Teena said with a big smile on her face.
 
 Mishra taught Class VI students about respecting and obeying elders. “He told us a story of a baby elephant that did not understand his potential and gave up. The moral of the story was that we should not underestimate ourselves and should never give up in life. We really liked the way he taught and we understood everything that he wanted to make us understand,” said Roshini.
