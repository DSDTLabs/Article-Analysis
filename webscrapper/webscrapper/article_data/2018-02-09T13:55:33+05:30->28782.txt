MADURAI: The city corporation intends to convert the   streets around the   temple into a paid parking zone.

 According to corporation officials, initial discussion was held with the   city police to explore the feasibility of a switch. “We expect to make headway with these discussions soon. Masi streets will become paid parking zones in two months' time,” said   commissioner,  . 
 
 Currently, the four masi streets witness slow traffic movement during the day due to congestion caused by parked vehicles. Two-wheelers encroach on the street's shoulder area forcing pedestrians to walk on the carriage way. 
 
 P Meenakshi, who works in a shop on the south Masi street, told TOI that walking on the masi streets drains her. “There is literally no space to walk safely due to the parked vehicles. They should consider widening the road to accommodate the vehicles and also provide pedestrian walkways. The traffic police also does not regulate truck movement in these streets,” she said.
 
 One of the civic body's proposals under smart cities project is to implement on-street and off-street parking policies. These changes would be implemented in the zone selected under area based development (ABD) plan, which is the neighbourhood surrounding Meenakshi Sundareswarar temple.
 
 “In due course, we would be in a position to declare the temple zone as vehicle-free area,” Sekhar added. But city traffic police maintained a cautious stance when asked to comment. “We are unsure how this proposal would work out,” said a senior police officer.
