PANCHKULA: When four   buffaloes worth Rs 2 lakh were stolen from the farmhouse of Dharam Pal at Pinjore’s   village early on Tuesday, he lost his entire herd and his only source of milk and other dairy products.

 At 11pm on Monday, he had tied the buffaloes inside a shed and around 2.30am made a check and found all heads inside. But when he woke up around 5am, the buffaloes were missing. He searched for the herd all over the village but found no clue. When he got tired of searching, he moved a complaint with the local police.
 
 On the basis of his complaint, a case under Section 380 (theft in a house) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) was registered at the   police station. Police say they will take the farmer along to different cattle markets nearby to locate the buffaloes. “The people who steal buffaloes always sell them off for a low price at the cattle market. Their aim is to make a few bucks. Cattle markets, thus, are best places to search,” said a police officer.
 
 Assistant sub-inspector  , who is investigating officer of this case, said: “We are also scanning footage from the CCTV (closed-circuit television) cameras to see if these security gadgets captured the   thieves.” The Murrah breed of water buffalo is kept for dairy production. Its home tract is the southern parts of   (the districts of Rohtak, Jind, Hisar, Jhajhar, Fatehabad, Gurgaon) and Delhi. The daily milk production record for a Murrah buffalo is more than 26 kilograms.
