Ahmedabad: As torrential rains have flooded many parts of Gujarat, the state education department and the Gujarat State Examination Board have postponed the Teachers’ Eligibility Test (TET), which was scheduled to be held on July 30.

 According to officials of the state education department, around 2.35 lakh candidates — including those who have completed PTC, BEd, and MEd courses — were to take the TET. In a meeting involving officials of the state education department and board members, it was decided to postpone the TET.
 
 The last TET was held in July 2015. New dates for the TET will be announced shortly, said officials.
