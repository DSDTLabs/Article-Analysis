NEW DELHI Terming Congress's support to JD(S) in Karnataka as "shameful", BJP president   on Thursday hit out at Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and recalled how civil rights were violated by Congress when Emergency was imposed in the country. 

  "The Congress president obviously doesn't remember the glorious history of his party. The legacy of Rahul Gandhi's party is the horrific Emergency, blatant misuse of Article 356, subverting courts, media and civil society," Shah tweeted, reacting to Rahul's allegation that the invitation to B S Yeddyurappa to form government in Karnataka was "murder of democracy". 
 
  "Murder of democracy happened the minute a desperate Congress made an 'opportunist' offer to JD(S), not for Karnataka's welfare but for their petty political gains. Shameful," Shah said. 
 
 He said BJP's win in Karnataka was the victory of every Kannadiga who voted to uproot the corrupt and divisive politics of Congress. "I am sure the new government under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will fulfil the aspirations of the people," he added.
