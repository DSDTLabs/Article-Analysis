AHMEDABAD: The cyber cell of the city crime branch has taken up the enormous task of calling about 17,000 people from 15 states across the country who were defrauded by Mohammed Jilani  , 23, who posed as a bank official to siphon off their money. Cyber cell officials said that the accused — who was arrested from the   of Jharkhand — had contacted 4,458 people in Gujarat. “We suspect around 30% of the people he called gave their card numbers and OTP to him,” said a cyber cell official.

 Assistant commissioner of police, crime branch, Rajdeepsinh Zala said the that challenge was onerous but it was important to trace the victims, who could turn out to be witnesses in the case. “We might send bulk SMSs to the numbers Ansari called,” Zala said.
 
 It came to light during Ansari’s interrogation that he was involved in the scam for about three years. However, most of the calls he made were after demonetization. Cyber cell officials said that since demonetization was announced in November 2016, many people opted to transact online. That could have made them vulnerable to cyber thieves.
 
 “Once Ansari managed to persuade victims to give away the ATM card number, the CVV number, and the OTP, he transferred money from victims’ bank accounts to one the 34 e-wallets he had created with the help of 10 different email IDs,” Zala said.
 
 “We have sent the seven cellphones recovered from the accused for forensic examination to trace the bank accounts he used,” a cyber cell official said. Crime branch officials said that although Ansari has not revealed anything about accomplices, he could have been a part of a syndicate.
