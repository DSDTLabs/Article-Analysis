NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) has taken a decision to produce   at gardens making use of waste being generated there itself. Also, the compost will be utilized at the same place. The project will be taken on a pilot basis at five gardens.

 Deputy commissioner   told TOI that the project will be taken up with the help of women SHGs. “Big gardens will be selected where private agencies will be appointed for operation and maintenance,” she said.
 
  superintendent   said the project will be extended to other gardens if the pilot project is successful.
 
 It will also save transportation cost as the NMC is now sending the waste to Bhandewadi dumping yard. Moreover, waste being burnt illegally may also end.
 
 This will be the civic body’s second such project. The NMC’s solid waste treatment operator   is treating 200 of the total 1,000 tonne garbage generated in the city and producing 35-40 tonne compost daily, which is being sold to Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF).
