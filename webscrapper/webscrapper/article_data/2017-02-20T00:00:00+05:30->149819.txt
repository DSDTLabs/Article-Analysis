It’s been a few years since we saw Palunku fame   in Malayalam films. 

 The actress, who had starred in many notable movies like Passenger and Drona is back in the industry with a new film titled Stethoscope. Lakshmi plays the role of a gynaecologist named Dr Bhagyalakshmi in the film, directed and scripted by Suresh Iringalloor.
 On her role, the actress says, “Bhagyalakshmi is quite sincere and dedicated to her profession and is a much-respected woman in the field. For her, the patients aren’t just random faces she meets in hospital, but like her own family. She also loves her husband and daughter dearly, and the film is about her life as a medical practitioner.” Veteran actor Rizabawa acts as her husband in the film and the movie’s shoot is happening in Perinthalmanna, Malappuram.
 
 About her sabbatical from the industry, Lakshmi says, “I was entangled in quite a few personal, medical issues. My dad had two cardiac arrests in a single year and I had to spend some time taking care of him. I also had to go through a surgery for my right knee for ligament tear in the past year, after which I had to rest well and not even move, for three months.”
 
 The actress says she had also changed her number and rarely checked the messages or missed calls on her previous number. Once she did, that’s how she ended up getting in touch with the movie’s director. 
 
 “All they told me was it is the role of a doctor and that it’s a good character. When my dear and near advised that Malayalam cinema has been going through a transformational phase, I thought why not take it up? But little did I know that mine is a central character and the film has such a touching subject,” she says.
