LUDHIANA: Six armed robbers have robbed Rs 7 lakh from a father-son duo outside their house in   on Friday night. The robbers threatened the duo with a weapon and snatched the bag of cash. However, due to darkness, the victims could not note the registration number of bikes or see the faces of the accused. When they raised an alarm, people rushed to the spot, and the police was sounded. The Model Town police have registered a case under Section 379-B (snatching) of the IPC against the unidentified accused.

 In his complaint to the police,   Bansal (35), said he and his father   (60) were iron traders and had their office in Millar Gunj. On Friday night after finding up work, they were returning home with their daily collection of Rs 7 lakh in a bag. While Rishi was driving the car, his father was sitting on the backseat with the cash bag.
 
 He added that after reaching his house, he got down from the car to open the gate of his house, while his father was sitting in the car. Meanwhile, an accused came towards him and overpowered him. Another accused — carrying a weapon in one hand and a glass bottle in another hand — rushed towards the car. They threatened them to kill him, snatched the bag of cash and escaped.
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-IV)  , assistant commissioner of police (ACP-Atam Nagar)  , and Model Town police reached the spot. The investigating officer from Model Town police station,   Janak Raj said following their daily routine, the father-son duo returned home on Friday night when miscreants robbed them.

According to ASI, police are scanning CCTVs installed in the area to trace the accused, but so far, no clues have been found.
