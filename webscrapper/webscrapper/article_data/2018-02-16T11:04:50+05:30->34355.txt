CHENNAI: In 2016, the Delhi government, citing shortage of healthcare institutions, announced it would allot land at cheap rates for public utilities and services. In Chennai, following this model could help make healthcare more affordable and accessible, say urban planners and healthcare analysts.

 While big corporate names in the health sector are in expansion mode, several tertiary-care hospitals run by trusts that offer more affordable treatment have been stagnant. "A medium-sized hospital will need at least an acre of land, besides the cost incurred in buying medical equipment. Only big names in the healthcare sector can afford this," said Dr  , director general of Association of Healthcare Providers of India. "This cost is often incorporated one way or the other in the hospital bills," he added.
 
 Taking a cue from Delhi government, TN too can offer concessions for select hospitals, especially in areas where facilities are few, he said, adding that it is the state’s responsibility to map hospitals and form a network.
 
 Public health experts say the state at present has given a free hand to private hospitals on where to set base or expand to. "It is completely unbridled," said public health specialist  . "We see tertiary care hospitals coming up in congested neighbourhoods, and smaller clinics that are supposed to serve as referral centers are few and far between," he said.
 
 While patients are forced to cough up higher costs with bigger hospital investments, residents who stay close to hospitals pay the price of poor planning. "Many of these hospitals have valets who park their cars brazenly in ‘no parking zones’," said  , who stays close to Apollo Children’s hospital in Thousand Lights. "The only step the police have taken is to set up these boards. When we call to complain, our pleas fall on deaf ears," he said.
