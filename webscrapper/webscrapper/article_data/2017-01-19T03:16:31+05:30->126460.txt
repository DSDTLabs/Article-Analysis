NEW DELHI: The first day of a six-day   series—Democracy and Social Justice, Access and Equality—began at the Jawaharlal Nehru University ( ) on Wednesday.

 The event, the third in such lecture  , was organised by the JNU Teacher’s Association (JNUTA) at the Azadi Chowk, the area around the administration block thus named after the February 9 incident at JNU last year, when three students were arrested on charges of sedition.
 
 JNUTA went on with the event, although the JNU administration explicitly forbade the lecturers on Tuesday from organising any event, dharna, or sit-in within 20 metres of the administration block.
 
 Speakers at the event expressed their grouse over the “stifling of democratic space” and claimed they were allowed entry at the gates only after misleading the guards.
 
 Bezwada Wilson, who received the Magsaysay Award last year, said that JNU, once known to be a beacon for democracy and freedom, was all but stifling those very values. “Democracy is under crisis as we cannot even enter universities,” Wilson said, while speaking on the topic, “Crisis of Democracy”.
 
 Wilson also spoke about Rohith Vemula, a student of the  , whose first death anniversary was commemorated at different locations in the country on Tuesday, January 17. 
 
 Ashwini Deshpande, a professor of the Delhi School of Economics, while speaking on the topic, “The grammar of caste”, expressed solidarity with the scores of students who were detained by police at the Parliament Street police station. Earlier, many students complained that they were dragged away and beaten up by police while taking out a protest march in commemoration of Vemula’s death on Tuesday.
