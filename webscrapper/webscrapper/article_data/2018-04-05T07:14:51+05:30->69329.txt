LUCKNOW: The controversy over the baraat of 27-year-old   from Hathras took a new turn on Wednesday with the Kasganj administration saying that the girl he was going to marry was a minor.

 Sanjay Kumar, a law graduate from Hathras, had announced that he would reach his bride Sheetal’s residence riding a horse in a 2km marriage procession that would pass by homes of   village in  , breaking the centuries-old divide between Dalits and Thakurs.
 
 The Kasganj administration has already made an alternative route map for an 800-metre long procession, saying this was done to avoid tension between the upper castes and Dalits. Now, in its report jointly prepared by SSP Piyush Srivastava and district magistrate RN Singh, the administration has told the parents of the girl to marry her off only if they can prove she has turned 18. 
 
 The report has attached a handwritten testimony from the headmaster of the primary school where Sheetal studied till class II that says that she is two months short of turning 18. The family, however, says that the administration is harassing them to favour the dominant Thakur caste. Sanjay has dared to take his baraat to Sheetal’s house through the Thakur locality
 
 
 
 
 The girl’s family and the prospective groom are now contemplating a bone test to challenge the UP government’s claims on Sheetal’s age. “We will go for a detailed medical test, if required. But we will marry for sure. It’s an arranged marriage and we will break the tradition of caste divide in this state.” insisted Sanjay.
 
 The girl’s family has already sent several letters to UP CM and police chief, seeking protection on the day of marriage.   Devi, who belongs to Thakur caste, refuses to help the couple as she doesn’t ‘want to see bloodbath’.
