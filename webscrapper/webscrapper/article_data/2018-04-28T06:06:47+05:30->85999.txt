 Anu wants to join IAS to change lives of women
 
 Everything in my job had become mechanical. So, I decided to quit and do something that would be a contribution to the society,” Anu told TOI.
 
 Her first attempt at cracking the exam was in 2016 after just twomonth preparation. She failed to clear the prelims that time. “Technically, this was my second attempt. But, I consider it as my first one because I could not prepare at all last time. I’m glad that I cleared it this time or next year would have been my last attempt due to the age limit,” she said. The 31-year-old mother wants to become an IAS officer to change the lives of women and children. “Since I have got this amazing opportunity now, I would like to make most of it and work for women’s empowerment.”
 
 Gupta, a native of Sirsa district, is already working as an assistant director in the Union ministry of corporate affairs. He completed his schooling from Sirsa and obtained a degree in mechanical engineering from the Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala. Gupta had taken online coaching from Chandigarh to prepare for the examination.
