NAGPUR: Former President and one of the tallest   leaders of post-Indira Gandhi era,  , has been roped in by   to deliver the valedictory address to cadres attending the third year course on June 7.

 Around 800 RSS workers aged below 45 years from across the country are attending the final year camp that is held every year at its headquarters here. Earlier it was called third year of officer training course (OTC) but is now rechristened Sangh Shiksha Varg. The passouts can become full-time ‘pracharaks’ who then carry forward the Sangh work for the rest of their lives. 
 
 Sources in the RSS here said the official announcement would be made at the “right time” about the former President attending the RSS event, but admitted that he had been invited. 
 
 More than the first NDA government headed by AB Vajpayee, the present one led by   is seen as working in consonance with the RSS on all aspects of governance. Senior ministers of the   government frequently visit the RSS headquarters. Two days ago defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman spent five hours at the RSS facility here during which she addressed the third year trainee and had interaction with general secretary Bhaiyyaji Joshi.
 
 Mukherjee, 82, has been associated with the Congress party right since 1969 when Indira Gandhi helped him to get elected to Rajya Sabha. He became one of her trusted ministers and had his first stint as Union finance minister between 1982-84. However, after her assassination, he fell out with the party.
 
 He then formed the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress party in 1986 which later merged with the Congress in 1989 when he returned. Mukherjee was the top troubleshooter of the Congress till 2012. He was the 13th President and was in office from 2012 to 2017.
