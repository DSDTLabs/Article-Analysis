AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Thursday held that levying of property tax on IBS/boosters of mobile telecom companies by civic bodies is not against constitutional provisions.

 Two weeks ago, the high court had turned down a petition filed by ATC Tower Corporation Pvt Ltd, which questioned Rajkot Municipal Corporation’s demand of Rs 80 crore towards property tax on   installed on different buildings in the city.
 
  had challenged Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) decision to impose property tax on IBS/boosters installed on buildings in Surat. The challenge was on the ground that IBS/boosters are not mobile towers and hence SMC’s decision was against the law.
 
 Vodafone submitted that an IBS/booster set does not comprise a mobile tower, but consists of a small structure made up of 2 to 4 poles of four-inch diameter up to 6 metre in height, on which a booster is fixed. The booster is supported by a single pole of about two-metre height. IBS/booster does not require any permanent structure, and it comprises of only poles, antenna, a microwave dish and supporting equipment. All material is lightweight and easily movable. Thus, it does not fall in the definition of a building or a structure.
 
 Since it is not a building or mobile tower, levying of general property tax on IBS/booster set is in violation of rules and hence they should be struck down Vodafone had argued. The company demanded section 141 of the   (GPMC) to be declared in violation of Article 243X of the Constitution. The company also urged the   to strike down Rule 8B of the Taxation Rules as arbitrary as it provides for computation of levy of tax on mobile and microwave towers. The HC, however, did not accept the argument and dismissed Vodafone’s petition.
