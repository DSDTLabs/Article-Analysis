Canacona: Bhushan Prabhugaonkar and Keshav Naik, sarpanchas of Loliem and Panchwadi, were ousted on Friday in two separate cases of no-confidence motion. 

 While Prabhugaonkar exited after five out of nine members went against him, Naik’s ouster was orchestrated by four out of seven members. Naik alleged the local MLA was behind the move. Esmeralda D’Costa, Panchwadi deputy sarpanch, was shown the door too.
