KOLKATA/SONARPUR: As six of seven robbers accused in the murder and robbery inside a   jewellery shop continue to abscond, cops are keeping a close watch along the   border and the cattle smuggling routes in North 24 Parganas and Nadia.Cops suspect that the robbers have not crossed over to Bangladesh yet. “Raids are on at possible hideouts in North and South 24 Parganas. All border police stations and outposts are on alert,“ said Arijit Sinha, SP, Baruipur.

 Police fear that the gang members might escape through these routes disguised as cattle smugglers.
 
 CID and Kolkata Police say the Sonarpur or the Ranaghat sexual assault and dacoity at a convent are not a one-off incident.
 
 Sources said the Bangladeshi gang might have been involved in the   financial firm loot that took place in February. “We are sending a detective department team to Bangladesh in connection to these cases,“ said an senior IPS officer.
 
 Though 48 hours have passed since the murder and robbery, Sonarpur continues to remain tense with local traders observing a bandh demanding greater security for them.
 
 At present, cops are interrogating the three suspects they took in custody on Monday. Besides trying to determine the whereabouts of the other gang members and conspirators, slueths want to ascertain the route chosen by the six to enter the country.
 
 The routes under scanner are   and the other in Dhamakhali.
