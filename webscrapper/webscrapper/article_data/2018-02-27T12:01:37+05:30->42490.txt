Bhubaneswar:   on Monday were trolled on   after a youth tweeted that officers of the force allegedly made him buy a piece of paper and a pen to lodge a complaint of burglary in his office on Sunday. 

 
 "I first dialled 100. The recipient asked me to call Khandagiri Police. When I called them, they asked me to lodge a written complaint. I immediately reached the police station and requested an officer to give me a paper and pen to write the complaint. The cops laughed at me," read the tweet by complainant Surya Mishra, a teacher of marketing, digital and social media marketing and entrepreneurship. 
 
 Mishra said the police refused to give him a paper and a pen. "I rushed back home and returned with a written complaint. They accepted it and said they would send some men to my office for an inquiry. I waited for more than 9 hours, but no one came," he added. His wife Shweta Agarwal said the police had not visited their office till Monday evening. The couple runs Unmukt Creative Centre to impart learning and life skills to children in the Khandagiri area.
 
 "Finally, we put in a new lock. Everyone told me to go through some police contact to get a response. Feeling absolutely cheated as an ordinary taxpaying citizen," an angry Mishra tweeted.
 
 His plight got Twitter users fuming as they questioned police's commitment to their work. "Had the same experience a few years ago in   (Bhubaneswar). The police don't have funds to provide a blank paper to complainants. Somebody should sponsor their stationery," tweeted a user called Biswajit Mohanty.
 
 "When my friend went to a police station to file an  , he was asked to buy paper and pens for the police station," read another tweet by Tapas Panda.
 
  said he would look into the matter. "Police stations have been asked to assist complainants and behave politely with visitors. I will find out what happened in Khandagiri police station," Bhoi said.
