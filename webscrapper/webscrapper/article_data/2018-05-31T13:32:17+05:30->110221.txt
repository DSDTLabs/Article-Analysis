NAGPUR: The work on   of a tall compound wall that was blocking the grandeur of British era  , situated near  , began on Tuesday so that people can get its full view. According to plans, the compound wall will now have iron grills erected on it so that the old charm of the structure could be easily visible.

 The tall wall was built in September last year that deprived the people of enjoying its beauty. Taking notice of this, former minister Anil Deshmukh took up the issue with the authorities concerned. Deshmukh wrote letters to PKV vice-chancellor Vilas Bhale and associate dean Parlawar, stating that the wall was a hurdle in the beauty of the historic building. Deshmukh suggested that the height of the wall be reduced to two feet and an iron grill be fitted on it.
 
 In reply to the letter, Parlawar informed that the wall was constructed by   ( ) in violation of terms and conditions of the no-objection certificate issued by the college.
 
 On the basis of the reply, Deshmukh wrote to municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal with suggestions on the height of the wall. But the matter was kept in cold storage for close to four months following which Deshmukh wrote to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, complaining that the beauty of the building was lost after the wall was constructed.
 
 His efforts finally paid off as NMC has started demolition of the wall. Iron grills will be erected shortly.
