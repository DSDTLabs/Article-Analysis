Amidst pouring reactions from women who have faced similar uncomfortable moments in the presence of  's CEO  , filmmaker   shared the blog post by Kumar’s ex-employee on Twitter saying, “Sharing this, because I know another girl who went through the same ordeal recently.” Speaking to us, Apurva says, “A lot of women don’t come out and complain about the harassment they face at work because they feel ‘log kya kahenge’. Filmmaker   also supported Asrani tweeting, "Harassment at the workplace must be denounced. Whether it is sexual, mental or the result of a person's perceived power over the other." (sic.) 

 "We must understand that there is a thin line between an employer and ethics practiced at the work place. People don’t know the difference and cross the line often. And the victim has to keep quiet due to the fear of losing her job. For some women, it is easy to handle while for others, such incidents shake them up.” Apurva also shares that he had asked the lady who had shared a similar incident with him, to go to the cops. “But she did not and neither did I. I feel guilty now, but it is good that women are speaking up for themselves,” he adds.
 Apurva also stressed on the urgent need of having sexual harassment cells in companies. He says, “According to the Vishaka Guidelines, every company with more than 10 employees should have a proper sexual harassment cell to look into the grievances of women.”
