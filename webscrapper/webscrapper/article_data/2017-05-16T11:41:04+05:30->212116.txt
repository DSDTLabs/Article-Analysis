Mumbai: Strong macro data and news of the earlier-than-expected arrival of   lifted investor sentiment on  , pushing both the   and the   to new all-time closing peaks. With banking & financial services ( ) and   sectors leading the rally, the sensex rose 134 points to close at 30,322, while the Nifty closed 45 points up at 9,445. The day’s session also took investors’ wealth to a new all-time high as BSE’s market capitalisation crossed the Rs 127-lakh-crore mark for the first time in history.

 On Friday, the government said that retail inflation for April was down at 2.99% from 3.8% the previous month, while the industrial production index for March (new series) grew 2.7% from 1.9% a month earlier. And on Sunday, the Indian Meteorological Department said that the monsoon had arrived in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, three days ahead of its normal date. Both the news cheered investors, which led to strong buying on the bourses. 
 
 In the bond market, too, a low inflation reading led to a rally in government bonds with the benchmark yield on 10-year gilts closing at 6.81% from Friday’s 6.89%. The gains in bonds came on the back of expectations that the fall in inflation rate could now prompt the RBI to cut rates, which led to a surge in BFS stocks, while the FMCG rally was fuelled by the news of normal rains, dealers said. 
 
 In the forex market, the Indian rupee closed 25 paise stronger at 64.06 to a dollar. This was the best closing level for the rupee since August 2015.
