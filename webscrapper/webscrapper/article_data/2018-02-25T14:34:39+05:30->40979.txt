Ankush who loves to be part of The Times Food  And Nightlife Awards every year is sad that he will miss the gala event this year. “I was all set to be part of all party   but I had to leave for Mumbai today morning for some personal work. I am usually on a strict diet but I thought today it will take a back seat because truth be told, I couldn't have resisted the buffet! I wish the event a great success,” said the actor from Mumbai.
