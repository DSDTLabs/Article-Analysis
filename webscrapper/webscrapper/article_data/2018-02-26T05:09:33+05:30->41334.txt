MUMBAI: The   served show-cause notices for blacklisting, after they were allegedly caught mixing debris with  , have pleaded innocence. 

 They claimed that during collection and transportation of garbage from the source to dumping ground,   staff are always present, so blaming them or trying to blacklist them was not right. 
 
 BMC had earlier this month served notices to garbage transportation companies DCon Do IT and RSJ, questioning them on why they should not be blacklisted and barred from bidding for contracts. This was after they were allegedly caught mixing debris with garbage, probably to extract more money from the civic body. 
 
 BMC solid waste management department officials said the   claimed that BMC staff are present all throughout the process of transportation. “They said BMC labourers load garbage into compactors while supervisors oversee their work, so they could not be blamed,” said an official. But he said they are not convinced with this reasoning, as mixing of debris with garbage can take place at any stage of transportation, and not only when their staff are present. “We will hear out the two contractors, after which a final call on blacklisting them will be taken,” said the official. 
 
 Five other firms too faced charges of cheating BMC similarly. Last September, BMC had issued show-cause notices to seven contractors for allegedly mixing debris with civic solid waste, and a police complaint was filed against the contractors for indulging in malpractices, but no FIR was filed. BMC served notices to the two companies only as it observed more than four instances of them mixing debris with garbage.
 
 The officials said contractors often indulge in such practices as payment is based on the amount of garbage they transport. Only if they transport over 5.4 metric tons or more, do they get paid 100% of the amount. They often mix debris to reach that quantum. 
 
 Opposition leader in BMC Ravi Raja said mixing of debris with garbage has been going on for several years, so harsh action should be initiated against the errant contractors. “A special investigation team must be formed to check the root cause, considering that BMC has been cheated of crores over the past few years,” said Raja.
