GHAZIABAD: A 23-year-old man from Dadri, suspected to be the man who threw acid on a sleeping woman's face on March 21, was arrested on Tuesday afternoon.

 Gulistan's family said they had all along suspected Shahrukh's hand in the attack. Police started looking for him after the 21-yearold too voiced the same suspicion from her Safdarjung hospital bed last week when her condition showed some improvement and she could speak.
 
 Gulistan suffered 80% burn injuries in the attack. Both her eyes are severely damaged. She lives with her family in Kaila Bhatta near Sihani Gate, and that's where Shahrukh attacked her. He had known her for a few months and wanted to marry her but was upset about her family turning him down.
 
 Zahid Qureshi, Gulistan's brother, told TOI on Wednesday , “When she was able to talk, Gulistan told us Shahrukh had threatened to throw acid on her if she married anyone else. It was a vital clue and we informed the police.“ Asked why they hadn't done so earli er, since the family had also suspected Shahrukh, he said, “We weren't sure. Secondly , we were afraid of Shahrukh's temper.“
 
 Shahrukh, who works as a driver, was nabbed at Ghaziabad railway station. “It was divulged to us by Gulistan and her family members much after the attack that they suspected Shahrukh,“ said SP (city) Salmantaj Patil.
 
 “The investigation revealed Shahrukh was a distant relative of Gulistan's aunt and had even sent a marriage proposal to her family but was rejected,“ he added. Gulistan's condition is showing gradual improvement, her family said, though she remains admitted in the ICU of Safdarjung hospital in New Delhi.
