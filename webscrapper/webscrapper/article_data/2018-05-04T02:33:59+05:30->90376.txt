The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has expelled stand-up comedian and actor   and director   from its membership, following allegations of sexual harassment against both of them.According to reports, it was said that the decision was made by the Boards of Governors on May 1.

  
 "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Board of Governors met on Tuesday night (May 1) and has voted to expel actor Bill Cosby and director Roman Polanski from its membership in accordance with the organization's Standards of Conduct," the statement read.
 
 It further read, "The Board continues to encourage ethical standards that require members to uphold the Academy's values of respect for human dignity."
 
 Cosby was found guilty by a Pennsylvania jury last week, on three counts of aggravated indecent assault for drugging and sexually assaulting former Temple University basketball administrator   in a   suburb in 2004.Director Polanski had pleaded guilty of raping a minor in 1977. However, he left United States in 1978 to escape sentence and has been mostly staying in France since then. Being a French citizen, he is protected from extradition. Polanski also has other accusations of rape against him.
