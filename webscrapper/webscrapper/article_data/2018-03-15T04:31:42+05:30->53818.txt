MUMBAI: Doctors at Bhaktivedanta   in   have removed 2,350 stones from the abdomen of a 50-year-old Vasai   who had known about the gall stone disease since November 2016 but was looking for alternatives to surgery. The woman was admitted earlier this month after she complained of severe abdominal pain. Dr B C Shah, laparoscopic surgeon, said the stones, measuring up to 10-12mm were removed in half an hour. 

 “Gall stones are crystal-like deposits that develop in the gall bladder. The deposits may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball,” he said.
 
 The patient said she did not know she had more than 2,000 stones in the gall bladder.
 
 “I was diagnosed at a Mumbai hospital more than a year ago. People told us it was common and suggested other options of treatment. For over a year I avoided surgery by using over-the-counter products to ayurvedic treatment,” said the woman. Doctors said she was recovering well post-surgery. Minati Mondal, a patient from Baruipur, had entered the   with 11,950 gall stones. The most   detected in an individual was 3,110 in UK. tnn
