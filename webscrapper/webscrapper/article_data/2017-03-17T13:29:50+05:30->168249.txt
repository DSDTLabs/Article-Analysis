SURAT: Textile traders in the country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) wholesale market in the city are upbeat following the decision of the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) to keep ‘sari’ out of the ambit of made-ups, which attract 2 per cent excise duty on retail price above Rs1,000. 

 In the Union Budget 2016, Union finance minister Arun Jaitely had imposed excise duty of 2 per cent on ready-made garments and made-up articles of textiles falling under chapters 61,62 and 63 of the Central Excise Tariff Act (CETA), 1985. 
 
 Textile traders were upset following the decision taken by the   to levy excise duty on articles of textiles, including ready-made garments and made-ups above Rs1,000. 
 
 A representation was made by Federation of   Traders Association (FOSTTA) and Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) for keeping ‘sari’ out of the ambit of the excise duty levy on retail price of Rs1,000. 
 
 The CEEC issued a circular dated March 15, 2017 for classifying ‘sari’ under chapter 50,52 and 54 of the CETA Act, 1985 and not under chapter 63, which attracts duty on the ready-made garments and made-ups. 
 
 FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal said, “The CBEC circular on keeping the sari out of the ambit of central excise duty levy has come as a big relief for textile traders. We had strongly represented to the government that sari is already classified in chapter 50,52 and 54 of the CETA Act 1985 and thus it should be kept out of chapter 63. The demand has been accepted and the fresh circular issued to this effect. Now, the textile traders won’t have to pay any sort of duty on the retail price of sari above Rs1,000.”
