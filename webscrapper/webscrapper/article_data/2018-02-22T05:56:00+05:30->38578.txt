NEW DELHI: Ration disbursal through point of sale devices, which started on January 1, has been put on hold for now.

 The announcement was made after a cabinet decision by deputy CM Manish   on Tuesday, but the department of food and civil supplies has been trying to find out the details and course of action. Sisodia said the government plans to introduce doorstep delivery of rations soon and has asked for a proposal from the chief secretary. But considering that the bureaucracy has decided to boycott meetings, it needs to be seen how this shift to the earlier system could happen.
 
 After a long study and pilot project, it was decided to shift to a POS-based system at 2,254 fair price shops. The idea was to end the manual system that was prone to leakages. Now, reverting to the old system would mean the withdrawal of all machines and reorientation of the fair price shops. The move would also need LG’s approval as e-POS was introduced through LG’s approval.
 
 There is a fear of chaos as month-end is just a week away and preparations for next month’s ration disbursal would start. The government says the cabinet decided on it as several MLAs pointed out that lakhs of people weren’t getting their rations due to biometric authentication failures.
 
 AAP has been claiming that due to this, 2.5 lakh families have been unable to avail of   rations since January.
 
 While the department is unclear how the 2.5 lakh figure has been arrived at, the elected government has done its math based on the live database of January, which currently reflects 31,000 ration card holders who were unable to avail of the scheme. The government has assumed that on every card, there are about four to five beneficiaries, so 2.5 lakh is an approximation and not a definite figure.
