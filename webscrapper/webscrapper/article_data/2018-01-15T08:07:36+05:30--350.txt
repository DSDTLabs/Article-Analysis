JAIPUR: Not only Jaipur but 52 other cities in the state remain exposed to the fire threat as there is neither a   nor a single fire tender. In the recent meeting at local self governance (LSG) department organised to review fire safety, it was revealed that 90   in the state do not have fire stations.

 Mandawa and Bissau in Jhunjhunu district can boast to be on the world map due to exponential footfall of foreign tourists. However, these two cities have to rely on neighbouring municipalities at the time of fire emergency, which are nearly 25 km away. An official source at Mandawa municipality told TOI, “To douse fire in our municipalities, we have to bank upon the neighbouring municipalities such as Fatehpur and Jhunjhunu. Thankfully, in the past 10 years, there has been no major fire incident here. However, equipped fire-fighting apparatus is need of the hour.”
 
 He added, “The work for a fire station is on and the municipality is expecting a fire tender soon after the state government provided the approval.”
 
 Similarly, famous education hubs Pilani and Laxmangarh too lack fire-fighting facilities. “Work to establish fire stations in many municipalities is on. Nearly 49 municipalities have invited tenders to set up fire stations. Other than this, 29 municipalities in the state have already issued work orders,” said another official.
 
 According to an official, the Directorate of Local Bodies (DLB) recently gave Rs 80 crore financial approval to purchase four snorkel ladders and strengthen the fire department in state municipalities. But the reality is as no municipality has purchased the desired equipment.
 
 “At present, two snorkel ladders are deployed in Kota and Jaipur. Now, the department has sanctioned funds to purchase hi-tech fire tenders for Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur and Bhiwadi. Tenders are invited and soon procurement will be made,” said an official.
