PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   (KCB) has revived the plan to have an AstroTurf hockey ground in the town and will soon send the proposal to the defence ministry for funds. 

 The town has gifted the country players such as   and  , who were part of the Indian hockey team led by Dhyan Chand that thrashed Germany 8-1 to win the gold in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Khadki went on to produce other Olympians such as Dhanraj Pillay, Vikram Pillay and  , but never had an AstroTurf ground. 
 
 As a result, the hockey enthusiasts have to go to neighbouring Pimpri where the civic body has built an AstroTurf ground and stadium. 
 
 The KCB had planned such a ground near Lal Bahadur Shastri school. It developed a multi-purpose stadium near the school at around Rs 1.25 crore and then CM   inaugurated it in 2014.
 
 The board’s proposal was sent to the district sports officer, Pune for allocation of Rs 5.31 crore for the AstroTurf hockey ground at the Khadki sports complex. The plan was submitted to the state and forwarded to the youth and affairs ministry in 2014. The proposal was rejected in 2015. 
 
 The KCB will again submit the proposal to the defence ministry for funds allocation under the budgetary head of creation of capital assets. 
 
 KCB chief executive officer Amol Jagtap said, “The board has approved the resolution to seek Rs 3.86 crore from the defence ministry to procure an AstroTurf for its stadium. The remaining Rs 1.45 crore, to be spent on allied works, will be the KCB’s share. We expect approval to the proposal in 3-4 months. We will invite bids for purchasing the AstroTurf once we get the approval.”
