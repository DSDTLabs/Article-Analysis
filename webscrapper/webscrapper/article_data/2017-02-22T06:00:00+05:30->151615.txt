Actor   and wife   welcomed their first   on Monday! Giving his friends a very small and succinct update on his social media, the evidently elated actor posted: “Nirvaan Aadarsh Krishna. 20th February 2017. 1.46 PM.  , you’re an absolute legend! Huge shout out to the cosmos (sic)”. This post on Tuesday followed a hint he dropped the day before with a simple, one-word status: “Today”. That was, in fact, enough for his friends to figure out what he was talking about. Good wishes and congratulations poured in for this adorable couple through the two days. And we are craving, as much as you are, to know more about the little one. Watch this space for more.
