NEW DELHI: The   has turned down AAP’s demand for allowing change or tampering of EVM motherboard during the ensuing ‘EVM challenge’, saying that changing the motherboard or internal circuitry of the machine was like changing the whole device itself.

 “It is the considered view of the Commission that allowing any change of the motherboard or any internal circuit etc of the EVM is like saying that anyone should be permitted to manufacture a new machine and introduce newly made EVMs in ECI system, which is implausible and irrational...any ‘look-alike’ machine is just a different gadget, which is manifestly designed and made to function in a ‘tampered’ manner and has no relevance, incidence or bearing on the Commission’s EVMs,”   said in a letter sent to   on Thursday.
 
 EC was responding to a communication received from AAP on May 24, urging the poll panel to reconsider the terms of the EVM challenge. “Such a scenario is completely ruled out within our administrative safeguards and stringent security protocols and that’s why it is not proposed in the ensuing  ,” said the Commission. Incidentally, AAP, or for that matter any party, is yet to confirm participation in the EVM challenge, scheduled to start June 3. 
 
 EC also reiterated that the three incidents cited by it to allege tampering of EVMs in Bhind, Dholpur and a BMC poll in Maharashtra were “factually incorrect, misleading and devoid or any truth”.
