PATNA: Leader of opposition in assembly   on Saturday asked CM   if he would now accept the Rs 5-crore cheque he had returned to the then Gujarat CM Narendra   in 2010 “just to pamper his ego”.

 The money was meant for the victims of floods that devastated Bihar in 2008.   was then heading an NDA government in the state and had returned the cheque to the Gujarat government soon after he was shown holding hand of Modi in an ad in newspapers on the eve of BJP’s national executive meet in Patna on June 12 and 13, 2010.
 
 A furious Nitish had then told media persons he would initiate legal action against the people who inserted the ad. 
 
 Reacting to the then Gujarat CM Modi’s advertised claim to have helped Bihar during the worst-ever Kosi floods, Nitish had asserted the money would be returned with interest. The CM secretariat in Patna had subsequently sent a cheque of more than Rs 5 crore to the Gujarat government.
 
 “Now that Nitish has again joined hands with  , will he ask Modi-ji to ensure the money, which was meant for the people of Bihar, is returned?” Tejashwi said while talking to reporters.
 
 The younger son of RJD president Lalu Prasad also sought to know from the CM whether he would now implement the BJP’s manifesto or continue to execute the common programme of the previous Grand Alliance government
