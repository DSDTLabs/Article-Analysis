These Chennaiites keep themselves updated about style trends in every sense — be it the latest in clothing or makeup. And they hardly miss anything that’s to do with fashion. Among others, spotted at this newly opened salon were Bigg Boss Tamil fame Bindu Madhavi and Gayathri Raguramm. Bindu looked quite ravishing in a pastel dress. Her chunky earring and makeup accentuated her features. Gayathri, on the other hand, sported a casual loose-fitting shirt and a pair of denims. Roop appeared uber-cool, in a crop top, and flaunted her toned midriff quite proudly. Pranitha and Ayisha loved the attention from the shutterbugs and posed happily for them.
