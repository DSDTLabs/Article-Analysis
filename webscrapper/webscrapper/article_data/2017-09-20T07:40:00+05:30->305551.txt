Chandigarh: A joint delegation of the SAD-BJP led by Punjab BJP president and Union minister Vijay Sampla will on Wednesday meet the chief election commissioner (CEC) of India seeking cancellation of two FIRs registered against their leaders in Gurdwara Chhota Ghalughara incident in Gurdaspur last month.

 SAD secretary and spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema alleged that two false FIRs have been registered at Tibber police station on August 20 and at Bhaini Miana Khan police station on August 21.
 
 The first FIR was registered against former SAD ministers Sucha Singh Langah and Sewa Singh Sekhwan, chairman of Punjab Sugarfed Sukhbir Singh Wahla, former chief parliament secretary Des Raj Dhugga and other party leaders.
 
 The second FIR was registered against former SAD ministers Sucha Singh Langah and Sewa Singh Sekhwan, Master Gurnam Singh and 19 other local leaders apart from 250 unidentified persons.
 
 Cheema alleged that all these leaders had been booked on the directions of ruling Congress party as a deep-rooted conspiracy so as to arrest these leaders at the time of election campaign in Gurdaspur Lok Sabha bypoll. He said all these leaders had simply accompanied Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh to Gurdwara Chhota Ghalughara where the local Congress leaders had stopped them.
 
 Cheema added that the delegation would apprise the Commission of the ulterior motives of the ruling Congress party. “We will demand an independent inquiry by the CEC and action against officers who have registered false FIRs to please their political bosses,” he said.
