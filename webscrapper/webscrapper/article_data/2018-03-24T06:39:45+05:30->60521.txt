BENGALURU: Notwithstanding opposition from the All India Veerashiava Mahasabha, the state government on Thursday issued a notification according religious minority status to   and   (who believe in   principles).

 However, the notification issued under Section 2(d) of the   State Minority Commission Act on Thursday (March 22), will come into force only after the central government accepts the proposal, and from the date when the   declares the community a religious minority.
 
 The state government clearly stated this in Thursday’s notification by the undersecretary of state minority welfare, Haj and wakf department. The notification also reads that religious minority status for Lingayats is subject to the condition that it does not affect the existing reservation facilities, rights and interests of existing minority communities.
 
 Law and parliamentary affairs minister T B Jayachandra told reporters that the proposal will be sent to the Union government in a week’s time.
 
 With this, the ball in now in the court of the Union government, and considering the state BJP’s stand on the issue, it is unlikely that the proposal will get the nod in the immediate future. Moreover, the Centre is neither duty-bound to accept the proposal nor is there a timeframe for it to approve such proposals, said a source.
 
 The reservation quota for Lingayats is likely to remain what it is under Category 3B, as there is no scope for alteration in the existing quota of minorities, as per the notification. In the present form, educational institutes run by Lingayats might get some benefits in terms of quota of seats for the community.
