TRICHY: Unions have appealed to the   to avert division to division transfer of staff. According to sources, a set of a crew - loco pilot and assistant loco pilot, has been transferred to Thiruvananthapuram from Trichy railway division.

 In a letter issued by the assistant personnel officer in Trichy railway division, dated January 3, 2018, it has been stated that loco pilot K Sekar from   and assistant loco pilot from Trichy, who were trained in diesel traction have been transferred temporarily for five months to Thiruvananthapuram division to meet the requirement for ballast train duty with immediate effect on the same pay and level.
 
 This was the first time a loco crew has been transferred to one division to another division, said D  , deputy general secretary of DREU.
 
 “According to railway norms, unless otherwise any mutual transfer is warranted or on the ground of punishment, nobody would be transferred to other divisions. We heard that the railway administration is aiming to move some more set of loco crews to Thiruvananthapuram. This would affect the movement of trains in Trichy division,” he alleged.
 
 According to available data, out of the sanctioned strength of 1.05 lakh loco pilots, 17,457 posts are lying vacant. In the case of the Southern Railway, 218 posts are lying vacant out of 4,468 crew strength. Despite a number of special trains increased in the zone, not even a single post was created, he charged.
 
 Therefore, the authorities should try to fill all the key posts for the safety and convenience of the passengers, Manoharan added
