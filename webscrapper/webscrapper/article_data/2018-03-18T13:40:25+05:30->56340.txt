 "Old currency notes which include demonetised Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes are counted and processed in sophisticated currency verification and processing system. The notes processed are shredded and briquetted in the shredding and briquetting system installed in various RBI offices," the RBI said in reply to an RTI query filed by a PTI correspondent.
 
 Once compressed into 'bricks', the shredded notes are disposed of through a tendering process, according to the reply.
 
 "RBI does not recycle such processed notes," the RBI said.
