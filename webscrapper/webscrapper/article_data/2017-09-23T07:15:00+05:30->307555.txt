Gurgaon:   asking residents to   the MCG polls were found outside the houses of the residents in   on Thursday morning. According to the posters, residents have been urged not to cast their vote as the problem of sagging high-tension electric   was yet to be solved. Residents, however, said they would definitely exercise their franchise in the MCG polls.

 Residents don’t know who have put these posters outside their houses. They noticed these yellow posters outside their front gate only on Friday morning “There has been many accidents in the past due to these wires. We want to get this sorted but we have voted in the past and will vote this time too,” said Praveen Sharma, resident.
 
 However, the ex-councilor and current BJP candidate Subhash Singla said they have already began to remove the cables. “We will complete the work soon. People should cast their votes because someone is trying to manipulate them,” said Singla.
