Nearly three years after tenure of the state’s   ended, the government has extended their term again citing a Madras high court stay on new appointments.

 After three months of the   members being in dark about an extension, the social welfare department recently wrote to the committees saying the tenure would be extended till March. In some districts, only a few received the letter as members had either resigned or held proceedings based on convenience.
 
 
 CWC in Chennai, for example, has been headless for close to three years. “We are struggling to deal with cases,” said a member. “Most of us are waiting for an official word saying we can leave,” she said.
 
 According to the   Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, the CWC should have five members, including the chairperson. It has the same powers as a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate of the first class. A child in need of care and protection is brought before the committee which decides what is best for the child. Children are usually sent to a child care institution till an inquiry is conducted. A final order must be given within four months of the admission of the child before the CWC.
 
 A Narayanan, founder of child rights advocacy organisation  , said delay in hearings because of vacancies in CWCs and Juvenile Justice Boards, forces victims of abuse and those in conflict with law stay at observation homes for longer duration than required. “They remain incarcerated in observation homes without bail and individual care plan on account of absence of   members except designated magistrates,” he said.
