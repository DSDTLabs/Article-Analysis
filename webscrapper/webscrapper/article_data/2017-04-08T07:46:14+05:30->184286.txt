VADODARA:   in making   in the city have decided that they will not make   (PoP) idols taller than five feet and   beyond nine feet. They have also demanded strict action against those who come from outside to manufacture and sell idols.

 The Murtikar Art Foundation, Vadodara (MAFV) held a meeting on Friday and decided to stick to the rules set by the city administration. While concessions were granted in the previous years by authorities, this year the idol makers have themselves decided not to expect any leniency and stick to the law.
 
 “We had met the police commissioner and discussed the issue with him. He was of an opinion that we should operate within the framework of the law. We have decided to do so,” said prominent idol maker Ashok Ajmeri.
 
 Sources pointed out that so far, it was Ganpati mandals who used to insist that the artisans made idols of large sizes. Idol makers said that even politicians used to support such moves at times. “But there were some incidents of not-so-prominent idol makers facing police cases after they made large idols,” said a member of MAFV.
 
 While MAFV has decided to stick to the norms, it said that PoP idols were being made on a large scale by manufacturers from outside the city. “There are people making such idols using moulds at places located on the outskirts of the city. An artist can make only limited number of idols with hand, but these people are involved in mass production,” said an idol maker Aniket Mistry.
 
 VMC as well as the police have decided to ban PoP idols as they led to pollution in city’s pond. The Sursagar itself has a layer of PoP that is believed to be around five meters deep.
