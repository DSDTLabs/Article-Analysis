GURUGRAM: The   ( ) authorities have been forced to extend the last date for bidding for setting up its office after failing to get even one bidder for the fourth time in a row.

 The fresh date to submit bids is May 22, sources said. The authorities have also decided to allow bidders to submit their quotations in sealed envelopes.
 
 GMDA is looking for an office space in locations like  , Sector 44 or within 500 metres of any key intersections near the   expressway, which are connected to public transport network. 
 
 The authorities say they are surprised at the lukewarm response. “This is for the fourth time that we are extending the tender submission date. Considering the size of the organisation and responsibilities, it is estimated that GMDA would need at least a 15,000-sq-foot of office space with modern amenities in any of the prime areas. It is felt that the rent which we are offering —Rs 45 per square feet— is less, and we therefore have revised it to Rs 60 per square feet. We are hoping that at least now we will get sufficient bids,” said  , additional CEO, GMDA.
