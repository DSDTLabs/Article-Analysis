GURUGRAM: The   (MCG) has started setting up open-air gyms in 15   across the city. According to   officials, such gyms will be set up in each of the 35 municipal wards in the city by April-end.

 The move comes after the corporation in January announced that it would set up 50 such gyms for the public this year. “We have started installing the machines in parks of 15 wards in the initial phase. Similar gyms will be opening soon across all wards in Gurugram,” said Ajay Kumar Nirala, executive engineer, MCG.
 
  “We are hopeful of setting up 35 open-air gyms across the city by the end of April,” Nirala added.
 
 Wards where the installation work has already started include ward numbers 2-6, 12, 13, 15-17, 19 and 30. 
 
 The parks where these gyms will be set up include the boosting station park in Sector 2, E-pocket park in Sector 21, Rose Garden in Sector 15, A-pocket park in Sector 23A and Gulmohar Apartment park in Sector 56, among others. 
 
 Officials said six different types of fitness machines will be available in all gyms, such as air walkers, chest press and leg press machines. 
 
 According to officials, MCG had carried out a pilot project a couple of months ago, which had received a very good response. Now that the project has been approved, the corporation has set aside Rs 90 lakh to install around 50 such gyms in Gurugram, out of which 35 will be installed in one ward each. 
 
 MCG had set up some open-air gyms in the city two years ago using corporate social responsibility funds, but they failed to take off, as no one was assigned to maintain them. 
 
 Asked about who would undertake the maintenance of the gyms, Nirala said, “Given that many parks in the city are now maintained by RWAs, the gyms would automatically fall under their supervision.”
