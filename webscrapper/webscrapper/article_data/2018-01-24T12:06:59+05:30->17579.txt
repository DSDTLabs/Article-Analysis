LUCKNOW: Displaying complete lack of sensitivity, police constables dragged an elderly woman along ground in   collectorate and heaved her into a police jeep outside on Tuesday noon despite knowing that she was mentally unstable.

 Identified as  , the old woman   wanted to meet   Sarika Mohan, a 2006-batch IAS officer.
 
 However, as Anarkali is perceived as a ‘nuisance maker’ the officials posted at collectorate cornered her and asked her to leave. And when she refused to budge, the officials summoned women constables who were told to drag the woman out of the building.
 
 DM   Mohan later said that three mentally unsound women are infamous for creating ruckus inside the collectorate and disrupting janata darbar.
 
 “Actually there are twothree women, who are mentally unstable. They have been coming to the collectorate for past 20 years. We have spoken to their families, even sent them for medical care. But they leave treatment mid-way. In the past, some officials gave them money to keep them away and hence they come back hoping for more. They start shouting and turn aggressive because of which we get disturbed and I am unable to meet public,” said the DM.
 
 However, in the video which is being shared widely now, female constables are seen pushing the woman towards the gate. When she falls on ground, the constables start beating her and drag her towards the police jeep. The feeble woman kept pleading the constables to let her collect the documents that were left behind, but in vain. The constables finally heaved her in a police jeep. Anarkali is said to be visiting collectorate again and again seeking resolution of her family discord. Explaining why officials asked police to take the woman out of collectorate premises, Sarika said, “We have tried everything. There is no solution. I cannot conduct my work properly otherwise.”
