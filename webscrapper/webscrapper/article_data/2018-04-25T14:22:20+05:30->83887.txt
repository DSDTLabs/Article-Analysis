VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) administration has put up a proposal before the standing committee detailing a formula to end the stalemate over the resettlement of those ousted from   after the 2014 razing drive.

 VMC had razed over 1,900 dwellings in the Kalyannagar. While the residents were allotted houses in Sayajipura and Kalali schemes for the economically weaker sections society, local residents there objected to this as the affected families from Kalyannagar were mostly from the minority community.
 
 In wake of the situation and an agitation by Kalyannagar residents, VMC agreed that those who were not being allowed to settle in the two housing schemes would be given houses at Kalyannagar itself. Till the houses came up, as many as 618 families were to be paid a rent of Rs 3,000.
 
 But unauthorised extra work was conducted on the Kalyannagar project and the contractor stopped work as his payments were stopped by the VMC. VMC initially insisted that that the beneficiaries accept houses at a scheme in Tandalja, but only around 50 families did so with the rest nsisting onhouses in Kalyannagar. The VMC also started defaulting on rents frequently and the money was released only after representations and demonstrations.
 
 The beneficiaries in February agreed to pay extra amounts to ensure that the houses at Kalyannagar are completed. The VMC was also asked to bear a part of the expenses. The VMC agreed to arrange a loan for the beneficiaries for their contribution.
 
 The proposal put before the standing committee states that the beneficiaries will have to bear Rs 4.11 lakh each for the house. In all 580 houses are being constructed at the site. The proposal states that the contractor who was handling the work and had conducted the extra work at the insistence of VMC officials has also agreed to resume work if his pending dues were released.
