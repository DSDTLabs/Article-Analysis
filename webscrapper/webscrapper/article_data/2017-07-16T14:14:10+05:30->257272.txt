KOCHI: The Angamaly judicial first class magistrate on Saturday dismissed popular  's bail plea and remanded him to judicial custody till July 25 in the actress abduction and rape case. Objecting to the bail application, the prosecution argued that   could influence witnesses and even pose a threat to the safety of the survivor.

 In a move obviously aimed at getting the court to see the bail plea in favourable light, the defense counsel submitted Dileep's two mobile phones to the Angamaly court. The defense counsel said since there was an intense search going on for the actor's phone ­ the gross visuals of the sexual assault recorded on a smartphone are allegedly in Dileep's possession -they were presenting it at court so that it could be sent for forensic analysis before the police chose to tamper with it.
 
 The court directed the defense to prepare an inventory, including details of the phone, before accepting the phones. Contending that the remand report submitted against the accused did not hold water, the defense counsel argued that there was no need to keep him in custody as Dileep was a person with stature in society and would abide by all conditions the court suggested for bail. The prosecution objected to the bail plea saying that there was chance of Dileep influencing witnesses in the case, including  's former counsel   and Dileep's aide Appunni, both of them currently absconding.
 
 The prosecution maintained that they have questioned more important witnesses and details would be presented before the court later. “Entire findings can't be divulged at this juncture, while there is already enough evidence to prove that there is conspiracy,“ the prosecution submitted. The case diary of the investigation has been submitted.
 
 The prosecution counsel cited an actor's interview where he said usually victims shut themselves up or commit suicide but that didn't happen in this case.
