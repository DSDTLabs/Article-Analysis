 : On Monday, the parliamentary bulletin announced that the term of four of BJP’s   MPs from Gujarat, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley; MoS, road transport and highways, shipping  , MoS, panchayati raj, agriculture and farmers welfare, Parshottam Rupala, and Shankar Vegad ends on April 2.

 With 99 MLAs and an additional support of an independent, the BJP in Gujarat lacks the political muscle to hold on to all four previously held Rajya Sabha seats in the upcoming biennial elections in March. 
 
 Since the Gujarat assembly constitutes of 182 MLAs, each party will require the support of 36.4 MLAs to elect one member to the Rajya Sabha.
 
 With support of 100 MLAs, the BJP can elect two of the four members to the Rajya Sabha comfortably. To elect an additional member and take its RS membership to three, the BJP will require support of additional 11 MLAs. The Congress on the other hand, which has a strength of 77 MLAs in the state assembly, can straight away elect two members.
 
 Secretary, Gujarat assembly, D M Patel, who is the nodal officer for several previously held Rajya Sabha, says, “Each Rajya Sabha candidate will require the support of 36.4 MLAs or 37 votes. With its present strength of 99 MLAs and an additional independent MLA, the BJP has 100 votes in its kitty.” He adds, “BJP will require 74 votes for its first two candidates while it will need at least 11 more votes to elect its third member to the Rajya Sabha. The Congress with 77 MLAs can elect two members to the RS.”
