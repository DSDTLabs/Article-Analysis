NEW DELHI: When   said she will "personally monitor"  ' responses to requests for help, she really did mean "personally", as can be seen from her responses since January 8, when 
  .

 
 On January 8, she gave fair warning to embassy staff worldwide: 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 The external affairs minister also tweeted a list of all Indian embassies'   handles. This came after the Christmas day launch of Twitter Seva, "an umbrella platform" of all External Affairs Ministry-affiliated Twitter handles. The platform is aimed at allowing Indians abroad get help faster than ever from passport offices and Indian overseas missions.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 Since she gave fair warning that she'd be monitoring tweets, Swaraj has often commented on the nature and speed of help provided. Individual embassy and visa section officers are seemingly more accountable as they reply directly about the status of help requests.
 
 This citizen, for instance, wrote saying she was denied a passport after police verification which she found odd. 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 The external affairs ministry's office in Delhi responded directly on Twitter.
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 Swaraj replied saying she found the response by the ministry "appropriate".
 
  
  
 
 
 
 One Indian-origin person in Chicago wrote on Twitter complaining about a long wait to get her PIO card converted to an OCI card. The Indian consulate in Chicago immediately responded and the minister was "happy with the (consulate's) response".
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 When the consulate in Kenya answered questions about OCI cards accurately and to the point, Swaraj appreciated that, too.
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 As one tweeter said:
