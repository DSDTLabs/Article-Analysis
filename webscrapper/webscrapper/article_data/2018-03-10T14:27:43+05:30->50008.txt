ARA: A search operation was conducted by the   authorities and police in Ara jail on Friday after a video went viral showing prisoners talking on cellphones and smoking ganja on the jail premises.

 While the raid continued for several hours, jail superintendent Niranjan Kumar   said the authenticity of the video is yet to be verified.
 
 “The video, claimed to have recorded in Ara jail was shown on a TV channel. After this, we conducted raids but no objectionable items were found. The faces shown in the video had no resemblance with any of the inmates. May be it is an old video. However, we will sanitize the jail premises,” said Pandit.
 
 “We regularly conduct raids to sanitize the jail premises. In the last one year, we have lodged more than 20 FIRs for violation of the jail manual. We have also seized several grams of ganja in our previous raids,” said the jail superintendent.
 
  also said that the authenticity of the video could not be verified and the sadar SDO and the sadar   have been asked to investigate the matter. TNN
