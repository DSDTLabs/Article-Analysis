DURBAN: The heavy military backpack mounting his shoulders, former India captain MS Dhoni walked around the   airport with the kind of liberty that he has been absolutely unaccustomed to back in India over the last 14-odd years. He had arrived in South Africa along with the rest of the one-day cricketers on January 23.

 
 
 
 The soiled whites have been dispatched to the laundry. The fresh blue, still in the wrapper, is waiting to be brought out. The red-ball trial is done with. The white-ball extravaganza is waiting to begin.
 
 On February 1, the first one-day match of the series will be played at the Kingsmead cricket stadium here in Durban. India have never won a one-dayer against South Africa here. Of the seven matches that both teams have played here with each other, the hosts have won six and one ended without a result.
 
 
 
 
 However, this team has more confidence than any other in the past about changing this bit with the Hardik Pandyas and Jasprit Bumrahs raring to go. Indeed, the white-ball marauders have a lot to look forward to.
 
 At the same time, while shorter formats are certainly where they've excelled all over the world, Team India also needs to remember the lessons they learnt in the Test series against South Africa. The 54 balls that took   to score his first run in   are enough for a   to go past a century and even further in limited-overs cricket. However, the effort that it took Pujara to survive 261 minutes at the crease to get to his 50 is one that the white-ball format will never help a cricketer understand.
 
 As India take the leap into their comfort zone, it'll be pertinent for them to not ignore the zone they're leaping out from.
