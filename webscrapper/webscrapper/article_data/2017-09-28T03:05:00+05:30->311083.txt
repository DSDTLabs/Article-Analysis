Nagpur: Within a span of seven days, the radio-collared tigress of Bor on Wednesday attacked a farmer in   village in Ashti range under   division.

 The victim   (40) was spraying pesticide in the cotton field when the tigress attacked him from the back. Eyewitness said that   suffered minor injuries on the hand as the tigress missed the target and hit the spraying machine instead. He was taken to Ashti primary health centre on a two-wheeler and his condition is stated to be out of danger.
 
 The tigress fled the spot after Padole’s wife Archana and brother Narendra raised alarm and gathered farmers in the nearby area. On September 20, the same tigress had killed a farmer Bhivaji   (58) from Wadali village when he was returning from the farm.
 
 This is the third   attack in the last 7 days. On Tuesday, a tiger from Bor had attacked a farmer in Met village, two km from Bor.
 
 Sharp shooter summoned
 
 The wildlife wing has sought Hyderabad-based sharp shooter Shafat Ali Khan’s help to recapture the tigress.   had earlier captured the same tigress from Bramhapuri. It was released in Navargaon area of Bor Tiger Reserve on July 29.
 
 Though efforts are being taken to recapture the tigress, the big cat has localized and is frequently changing places. The spot where the attack took place on Wednesday is 7km away from the spot where Harle was killed. The frequent attacks have demoralized the monitoring teams, which are increasingly facing the brunt of the villagers’ wrath.
