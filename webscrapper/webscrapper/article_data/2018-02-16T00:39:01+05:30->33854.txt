 The calculators are out, finally, and   know exactly what they have to do to qualify for the semifinals of the Indian Super League.
 
  Favourites at the start to qualify, or even top the group, thanks to their impressive start to their campaign, FC Goa have now fallen behind. The solitary-goal loss against   at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda has left them with a mountain to climb but coach   believes his side can still make it to the top four.
  
  “Despite only one point that we have accumulated in the last four games, we still continue to depend on ourselves. We have five points less than Jamshedpur FC with a game in hand and we have to play against them. So, after all we still depend on ourselves. But this is obviously the last opportunity. We cannot make any more mistakes. The four games remaining are four finals,” Lobera told reporters after the loss against Chennaiyin FC.
  
  The loss has left Goa in sixth spot and follows some insipid performances in the last four matches where they have just picked up a point, losing three games including two at home. Even against Chennaiyin, Goa had their chances to get something out of this game but for the second successive match, Goa’s famed attack came a cropper
  
  “I sincerely think we deserved a lot today.   has been unjust to us. Even last week (against Bengaluru FC), it was unjust. I think the team did everything they could in the second half to try and equalise. We had a lot of chances, some very clear ones, but the ball didn’t go in. I will remember the effort of the team; they chased till the end,” said Lobera.
  
  FC Goa will miss influential midfielder Manuel Lanzarote for the next match after picking up a booking, his fourth in the league.
