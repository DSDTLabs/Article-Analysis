BHOPAL: At a time when chilling reports of crime against children, including rape and sexual abuse are being reported daily, Bhopal   ( ) continues to remain without a chairman for the second year in a row. 

 As per the law, a committee cannot issue an order without the chairman and should have a team of five members, including the chairman. However, state capital has only four members, who decide the fate of children, who committed crime. Sources said protection of child rights, which is a prime responsibility of the CWC and delivering justice pertaining to children cases, the government seems to be reluctant to accord priority to fill the vacant post.
 
 "It is quite apparent from the fact that child welfare committees (CWCs) in many of the districts across  , including state capital are running without members or chairman," official sources said. In 2013, a research report was published by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), which revealed in Madhya Pradesh, 27 child welfare committees have either no members or no chairperson. It means resolving a case can even take a year, going by the report finding.
 
 The gravity of the situation could be gauged from the fact that in recent past, a 15-year-old burns victim, Sonali, who was from Bhopal, lost her life, waiting for the orders of CWC to grant permission to shift her to a private hospital for better treatment. Her father had poured hot oil on her in a fit of rage.
 
 Under the   Justice Act, vulnerable children in need of care and protection from the state must be sent to the district CWC, which determines form of rehabilitation they require.
