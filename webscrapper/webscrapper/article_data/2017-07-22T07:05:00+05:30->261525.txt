Amritsar: The death anniversary of legendary singer Mohammad Rafi on July 31 will mark the beginning of a nationwide movement for conferring the Bharat Ratna upon him, so claims a Punjabi music director. 

 Music director, a singer and an ardent fan of Rafi, Harinder Sohal, told TOI that cadences of the heartrending songs of the legendary singer took the world by storm and he ruled the hearts of music lovers not only during his life but till date. Sohal said he would start the movement from Rafi’s birthplace in Amritsar district, Kotla Sultan Singh village. “Rafi sahib was born in Kotla Sultan Singh but none of the successive governments cared to erect a memorial of him. We, the fans, of Rafi sahib have decided to begin a nationwide movement for Bharat Ratna award from the school where he had studied,” said Sohal.
 
 Located about 28km from Amritsar, Kotla Sultan Singh has all the modern amenities a Punjabi village can boast of but no memorial of its son Rafi who had brought fame to his birthplace, he said. The village panchayat has, however, earmarked a piece of land for the purpose but lacks further funds to erect the memorial. With the efforts of local residents the village school has named it computer hall after Rafi. A small signboard on the village road mentioning ‘Rafi Marg’ has also faded away with time. 
 
 Sanjiv Kumar Dixit, Lucknow-based lead activist of the national campaign for Bharat Ratna for Rafi, told TOI they had earlier taken an initiative and had also staged demonstration at Jantar Mantar, New Delhi. “Rafi sahib’s name was included in the list of probables but there is the need of one last push to achieve our goal for the great singer.”
