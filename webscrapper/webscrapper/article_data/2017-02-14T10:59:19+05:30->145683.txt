JAMSHEDPUR: Veteran tribal leader and former MP Salkhan Murmu said on Monday that the state government’s attempt to invite investors to set up industries will have an adverse effect on the ecology of the region. 

 “While mineral resources are being exploited at a rapid rate, trees are being uprooted to set up industrial hubs which is affecting the environment negatively,” Murmu said. The governor   has allowed him to present his case on February 14, he added.
 
 “I will request the governor to exercise her constitutional powers and prevent the exploitation of the state by thwarting the proposed GIS,” the former MP said. 
 
 Murmu said, “I have resolved to take up the summit issue at the global level to draw the attention of the ad hoc group working on the Paris Agreement for climate change.” 
 
 The tribal people of the state have undergone tremendous loss since industrialization began in erstwhile Bihar and now they are not willing to suffer any more, the tribal leader said. 
 
 “The speedy amendments in the Chotanagpur Tenancy (CNT) and   (SPT) laws is aimed at gifting the mineral resources to the capitalists and corporate companies,” Murmu said, accusing the 28 tribal MLAs of being equally responsible for allowing the government to amend the tenancy laws.
 
 “Sensing the growing resentment among the tribal community over the CNT and SPT issue, the government has decided to impose prohibitory orders in Ranchi on the eve of the summit,” the leader said.
