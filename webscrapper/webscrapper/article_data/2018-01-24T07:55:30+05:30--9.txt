SURAT: Four persons were booked on Tuesday by Sachin GIDC police on Monday for allegedly cheating a Mangalore-based doctor of Rs 2.25 crore. The complaint registered in the city is one of the three police complaints lodged in different parts of the country in the fraud of over Rs 5 crore.

 Sandeep Dakhra of Mota Varachha, Daval Bhikhadiya and  , both of   area, and one unidentified person, whose image is captured on closed circuit camera, were booked based on a complaint lodged by an official of   Omkishan Patel. 
 
 Dakhra and Balda are employees of Axis Bank, while Bhikhadiya is former employee of Axis Bank. The fraud was carried out between January 8 and January 18.
 
 The accused allegedly transferred Rs 2.25 crore from Axis Bank account of Dr Sushil Deva Prasad   with bank’s Mangalore branch. The accused changed the account’s ownership details by claiming to the bank officials that Jathana is already dead. They changed the mobile phone number of the victim and later transferred the money. However, the bank recovered Rs 1.23 crore of the total transferred money.
 
 Further investigation revealed that similar fraud took place in Mangalore of Karnantaka and Sirsa of Haryana in which money was withdrawn from Jathana’s account.
 
 “It is a major racket and it seems that some more persons are involved in it who could be operating it from outside. The bank officials are also suspected to be involved, which has enabled accused to carry out the fraud without getting noticed,” deputy commissioner of police, zone II, Vidhi Chaudhary said.
