The Delhi HC on Tuesday stopped   from selling Odisha Slurry Pipeline Infrastructure to Mauritius-based Numetal until April 15. The order was given on a plea filed by SBI, whose lawyer argued Odisha Slurry cannot transfer stake without the lender’s approval.

 Numetal Mauritius — a special purpose vehicle in which the Ruia family has an interest — earlier confirmed that it had entered into an agreement to purchase  , a key pipeline which supplies raw material to Essar Steel’s Odisha plant. The proposed bid for the pipeline had bankers seeing red. Particularly since recent amendments to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code bar defaulting promoters from bidding for their own assets until they clear overdues.
 
 The Ruia family has not done so yet and hence is not eligible to bid for Essar Steel.
