CHANDIGARH: The district consumer disputes   has directed an   to pay the claim amount of Rs 70,000 and   costs of Rs 15,000 for refusing to honour a claim for   

  The complainant Sukhvir Kaur, a resident of Kharar in Mohali, purchased five cows through Punjab National Bank, Sailba, and got them insured with United India Insurance Company on August 7, 2016. The insurance policy was effective from August 22, 2016 to August 21, 2017. A veterinarian inserted microchips on behalf of the company and the same were recorded in the health certificate and submitted to the insurance company.
 
  One of the cows died on September 1, 2016, and the insurance company was informed. The vet, Dr  , inspected the cow and Dr D M Singh conducted the postmortem, recovered the microchip and prepared the postmortem report.
 
 The complainant approached the insurance company a number of times, but her claim was rejected on October 4, 2016 saying the cause of death of the cow did not fall under the terms and conditions of the contract.
 
 The complainant approached the forum, and, after hearing both parties, the forum said the insurance company had rejected the claim citing an exception clause that said it would not be liable for death within the first 15 days.
 
  "A bare perusal of the exception clause (supra) would reveal that the claim is not payable in case the disease is contracted by the animal during first 15 days from the commencement of the policy. But, in the case on hand, the position is quite different. The death of the animal did not occur within 15 days of the commencement of the insurance policy due to some disease, rather the animal died due to sudden heart attack, which is evident from the postmortem report," the forum held.
 
 The forum said the insurance company had "wrongly and illegally repudiated" the claim of the complainant, and said the company was deficient in rendering service. The orders to pay the claim and compensation to Kaur were then passed.
