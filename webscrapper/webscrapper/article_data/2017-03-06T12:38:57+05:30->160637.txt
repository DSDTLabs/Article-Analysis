Actress   says she has made a pact with her parents actors   and Don Johnson not to watch her 'Fifty Shades' films.

  
  
 The 27-year-old actress says it is 'hard' for them to come to terms with this condition but is thankful they agreed to it. 
 
 "I know it's tough. But I made them promise and they respect that... That's hard for them, just this huge movement around these movies that I'm part of, but not being able to watch them," says Johnson
 
 She adds she is particularly grateful to her parents for not watching 'Fifty Shades Darker' because it's more erotic than the first film.
