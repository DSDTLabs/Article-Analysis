Bhopal: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called upon officials to fulfil promises and government committments. “I must remind officials that announcements made by me are not implemented in letter and spirit. Apparently expressing his displeasure over the delay in delivering on promises, he expressed the hope that announcement made in Kolar would see the light of the day. 

 “I must remind officials that the announcements made by me are not implemented in letter and spirit. Now, if you approve I would make announcements here, too. But, will they be fulfilled in the prescribed time period ?,” asked the chief minister while addressing people in Kolar area on Monday.
 
 Chouhan’s statement must have caused discomfiture to officials present on the occasion, especially when leader after leader from the BJP talked of red-tape in the state. The chief minister urged people to bear inconvenience for some more time as poor development in Kolar area had always been a major political issue.
 
 “Development in Kolar area was done in a haphazard manner. Now, the government is taking note of it,” Chouhan said.
 
 The chief minister's statement gave the Opposition Congress a chance to take a dig at the state government for poor implementation of promises. 
 
 “Chief minister’s comment on babus clearly showed the height of babudom in the state. This also proved that complaints about high-handedness of bureaucracy made by BJP leaders during party president Amit Shah’s visit were true and justified,” said Congress statement spokesperson K K Mishra.
