MUMBAI: The   on Monday approached the   seeking urgent hearing of its plea relating to the parking of fire engines inside Priyadarshini Park at Napean Sea Road. 

 In January 2018, the HC had held that the BMC’s action of parking fire engines inside the park and setting up a temporary shed in June 2017 was “high-handed” and “illegal”.
 
 The over 65,000 sq m Priyadarshini Park was set up on reclaimed land after it was handed over to   Citizen’s Forum on an adoption basis in 1985. According to the BMC, 4,098 sq m of the park is reserved for a fire station in the 1991 development plan. The 2013-14 development plan maintains the reservation. 
 
 The BMC has claimed before the court that   was needed in the area as in an emergency, a fire engine from stations at Gowalia Tank, Byculla, Fort, or Nariman Point take 30-50 minutes to reach the site.
