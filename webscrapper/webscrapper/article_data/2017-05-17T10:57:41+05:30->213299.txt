PATIALA: With mercury soaring this  , instances of   too have risen. Officials say there are days on which   of fire are received. Given the  , the department is grossly under-staffed ­ just nine   are expected to protect a city that spreads across 339.9 square km.

 The department has two leading firemen, eight drivers and five sub-officers. It is equipped with five big fire tenders and three small ones, an ambulance and a bike fire extinguisher. Two fire tenders are at present out of service and in need of repair.
 
 Under the norms of the Department of Fire Services, there ought to be four firemen, one leading fireman and a driver for every fire tender ­ this shows how woefully understaffed the city fire department is.
 
 At the time that TOI visited the department on Tuesday , two vehicles were out to attend to fire-calls. Five tenders were stationed at the office. A fireman at the spot said if another fire-call were received, the department would be unable to handle the situation ­ although fire engines were at the ready , there was no driver! In recent days, fire inci dents have necessitated calling in staff from adjoining areas.There were cases of fires reported from 70 villages in the district in recent days, and even standing crops had been gutted. “We cannot say there is a dearth of fire equipment.
 
  However, there are not enough firemen to use the equipment,“ one fireman said, seeking anonymity . He said people often complained that fire tenders arrived late. “What they do not understand is how short-staffed we are, and how stretched the men are as they attend to one call after another. It becomes difficult to attend to each incident promptly .“
 
 Fire department staffers said the matter of the large vacancies hobbling the functioning of the department had been raised with local bodies. Letters had also been sent to the cabinet minister.
