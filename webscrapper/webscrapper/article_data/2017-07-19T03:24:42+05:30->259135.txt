NEW DELHI: After  , South Delhi Municipal Corporation has initiated a project to install 100 water ATMs and 100 mobile toilet vans across its area.

 The move has come after LG Anil Baijal held a meeting with the civic bodies last month and directed them to ensure that water ATMs are installed across Delhi at the earliest and are maintained properly.
 
 Senior officials claimed that the tender has been floated and once installed, people can get chilled filtered water for just Rs 2 (250ml). “Paper glasses will be available at every  . If someone wants to fill their bottle, they will have to pay Rs 5 per litre,” a senior official said.
 
 As a pilot project,   had installed its first water ATM in Defence Colony Market last month. “The response was good and we decided to expand the services across our jurisdiction. In Defence Colony Market, every day about 300 glasses of water are sold. Once these ATMs are installed, people will not have to buy packaged bottle any more,” he said.
 
 The machine will have a capacity of 5,000 litres of RO water along with a provision for dumping paper glasses. As per the tender, every vendor has to ensure that glasses and any other kind of waste accumulated near the ATMs are cleared on a daily basis.
 
 SDMC has identified 20-25 points in four zones — central, south,   and west — for the installation and the tendering process. “The space for placing water ATMs will be provided by SDMC,” added the senior official.
 
 The areas with no public toilets will have mobile toilet vans. “We have floated the tender to procure 100 mobile toilet vans and by next month these will be deployed in areas within our jurisdiction. We have initiated the process to identify the sensitive areas where there is no provision for public toilets,” said the official. NDMC had earlier collaborated with artists and painted the walls where urination in public was more.
