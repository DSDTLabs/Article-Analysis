  The 63-year-old star says she has acheived the target by changing her lifestyle instead of dieting for years, reported AceShowbiz.
  
  "Nearing the 45-pound weight loss mark is a great feeling!" says Oprah.
  
  "After spending literally years on more diets than I care to count, I finally made the shift from dieting to a lifestyle change. Everyone is different, but for me what's worked is Weight Watchers... Today I'm more conscious about what I eat, balancing indulgent things with healthier options," she adds.
