MUMBAI: In a setback to the management of the World Trade Centre ( ) in Cuffe Parade, the Bombay high court on Thursday dismissed a plea challenging the Maharashtra   Tribunal’s order allowing shopkeepers operating out of the premises to intervene in its dispute with the state. Justice   upheld the MRT’s order allowing the Lessees’ Association, comprising of the shopkeepers to have their say in the case. 

 Last year, the collector had directed the sealing of the WTC, which is managed by M Visvesvaraya Industrial Research and Development Centre (MVIRDC) over violation of   conditions. The high court had reversed the sealing and subsequently the government had said that MVIRDC could file an appeal before the MRT. In February, the MRT had allowed the association of shopkeepers to intervene in the case.
