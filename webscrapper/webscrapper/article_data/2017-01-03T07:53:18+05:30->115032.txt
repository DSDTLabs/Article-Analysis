SHAHJAHANPUR: Amid rumours being circulated on social media channels that the central government may soon withdraw Rs 2000 notes and introduce new Rs 1000 notes, bankers in Shahjahanpur have denied any such move is on the cards. There was panic among the people after the message was forwarded to various social media circles along with a picture of an alleged new Rs 1000 note. A lot of residents approached bank staff with their Rs 2000 notes asking for change.
 
  Lead bank manager BM Gupta told TOI, “We don’t have any news about the new Rs 1,000 currency notes. The pictures (of the note) being circulated on social media are fake. There is no news about discontinuation of the Rs 2,000 note in the near future and people should simply ignore such rumours. Government is encouraging people to go cashless and this is our priority at the moment.”
  
  People were panic stricken when the rumours began to do the rounds. Such was the impact that people tried to save Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes. Long queues were seen outside ATMs dispensing Rs 500 notes whereas few were found standing outside those dispensing Rs 2,000 currency notes.
  
  The staff at a petrol pump here were told by their owner to keep aside Rs 500 notes.
  
  Surendra Singh, president of the local jewellers’ association, told TOI, “In the past two days, there have been several enquiries from our customers about this issue. Many of us have seen such messages on WhatsApp and   but we are all ignoring them because changing currency notes again seems to be a distant possibility. We are assuring everyone to ignore such messages.”
