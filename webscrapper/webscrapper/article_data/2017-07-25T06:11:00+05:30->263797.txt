Nagpur: Mangru Portet (48), having more than 40 offences against him, was killed during an encounter with C-60 commandos in the forest of Kopewancha near Rajaram Khanla village in Aheri taluka on Sunday.

 Portet, engaged in the movement for more than two decades, had a reward of Rs6 lakh on his head. He was part of Aheri Dalam and an area committee member.
 
 Portet, who is also a native of Aheri taluka, had been working in the medical unit of the outfit in Gadchiroli as a ‘doctor’. Naxalites generally label such cadres as ‘doctors’ and make them a part of their medical unit, who is trained in basic first-aid and preliminary medical assistances in basic ailments.
 
 Portet was shifted to Aheri a couple of years ago by the senior brass of rebels so that he can strengthen the base of the party in his home taluka. A 12-bore rifle too was seized from spot.
 
 Gadchiroli DIG Ankush Shinde said the Naxalites had gathered at the forest between Rajaram Khanla and Damrancha to hold a meeting. “It was their temporary camping site which was raided by the C-60 commandos following a concrete information. We feel that more Naxalites could be injured during the exchange of fire,” he said.
 
 Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh said the security forces were already on alert ahead of the Naxalite week between July 28 and August 3, which the rebels observe to pay obeisance to their slain cadres. “The Naxalites generally put up banners and distribute pamphlets prior to the commencement of the week as part of their propaganda. Portet and his colleagues were also preparing to observe the week,” he said.
 
 Deshmukh said the encounter lasted for around 40 minutes with heavy firing from either side. “Portet’s body was handed over to his family after the post mortem,” Deshmukh added.
