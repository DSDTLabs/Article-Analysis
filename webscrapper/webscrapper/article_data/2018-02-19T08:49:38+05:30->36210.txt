RAJKOT:   (LCB) officials busted a racket of   worth Rs 1.17 lakh at   on Saturday night. 

 The cops recovered 50 containers containing 1,750 litre diesel.
 
 Six accused — Ibrahim Pathan, Abbas Kara, Hussein Kara, Haji Kacha, Raju Parmar and an unidentified person, all residents of Khari Rohar village of Gandhidham taluka — fled into the sea in the boats they had brought for loading the fuel. 
 
 “The accused would poke holes into pipelines with hammers and nails and collect diesel in containers which they would release into the sea with the help of ropes. The containers would be loaded on to the boats. Thus, by taking the sea route, they would avoid checking at the checkpost,” said an LCB official. 
 
 “After poking holes, they would put patches on them and colour the pipelines to conceal the theft. However, they desisted from using the drilling machines as flashes produced during drilling had caused a fire in the past, killing a diesel thief,” added the official. Ibrahim was arrested last year in a diesel theft case.
