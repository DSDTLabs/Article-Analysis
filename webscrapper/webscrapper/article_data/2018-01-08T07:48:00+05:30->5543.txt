Ludhiana: A day after ‘The Times of India’ highlighted the issue of police inaction in theft cases at Lawyers’ Chambers, Division No.5 police have registered a case into a theft at one such chamber. On Saturday, TOI had reported that even the property of lawyers is not safe from thieves, as during the past 33 days, 19 incidents of thefts had occurred at the District Court Complex. The worst part is that victims complain of inaction by the police, and are themselves fighting to get cases lodged into the thefts.

 In her police complaint, Simran Kaur — who has her chamber on the sixth floor of the complex — said that on 22 December last, she closed her chamber after locking it. She added that when on 2 January, she came to her chamber after the winter break, she found the chamber’s lock broken. On checking her belongings, she found the inverter battery missing, along with Rs1,600 cash inside the table drawer, and other costly items.
 
 She said some unidentified thief had stolen these articles. After she lodged a complaint with the police, cops from the court complex reached the spot and started a probe. They have booked some unidentified accused persons for the theft, and initiated further action. The District Bar Association (DBA) said cops need to register cases in all thefts in the complex.
 
 “Though facing pressure because of ‘The Times of India’ news story, the court complex police have started registering FIRs into theft cases, we will not rest until they lodge cases in all complaints. There are 19 such incidents that took place at the complex since December 3, and in almost all the cases, police have not acted so far,” said DBA acting president Harjot Singh Harikay. He added they were also planning to meet Ludhiana police commissioner to apprise him of such cases in the court complex.
