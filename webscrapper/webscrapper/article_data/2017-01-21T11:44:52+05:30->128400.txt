THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has shifted   Dinendra Kashyap following a law and order situation that emerged in front of the main venue of the school youth festival on Thursday over a   with the body of slain party activist Santhosh Kumar.

 The government has effected a mutual transfer between   and Mahipal Yadav, who was posted IG (crime branch) in last week's reshuffle.
 
 Police had denied permission to the procession, which led to tension in the area. The issue was later resolved after district collector Mir Muhammed Ali intervened. Kashyap was one of the few officers retained in his post after the LDF came to power. TNN
