MUMBAI: The state recorded 435 farmer suicides till February-end this year despite a   declared in June. The same period last year recorded 414 cases. 

 Official data shows two regions,   and   saw a rise in farmer suicides in the first two months this year over last year. 
 
 The dry belt of Marathwada saw 152 cases this year compared to 134 cases in the same period last year, a rise of 13%. North Maharashtra recorded 72 cases this year compared to 47 cases last year, a rise of 53%. 
 
 The   region, home to CM Devendra Fadnavis, continued to report the highest number of farmer suicides with 199 cases in January and February. Both Vidarbha and Marathwada are cotton-growing regions. 
 
 Nearly 80% of the cotton growing area, or 34 lakh hectares, has been impacted by the pink bollworm pest attack. An area of around 3 lakh hectares growing various crops was affected by the recent hailstorm too.
 
 Farmer groups stress that the crucial issue of pricing of crops has yet to improve, without which farm incomes will not rise. “There has been barely any procurement by the government under the minimum support price (MSP). In the case of soyabean, barely 3% of the crop has been picked under the MSP,” Ajit Navle of the Kisan Sabha said. 
 
 Cotton prices have also been impacted by the pink bollworm attack, said activist Vijay Jawandhia. “Good quality cotton is selling at Rs 4,600 but poorer quality cotton is selling at around Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000. This is the price for 30-40% of cotton sold,” Jawandhia said. 
 
 Farmers selling to government centres under the MSP are grappling with delayed payments. Last week, the outstanding dues for tur dal procured under the MSP ballooned to Rs 800 crore.
 
 The impact of the loan waiver is yet to kick in with payouts proceeding at a slow rate. “This has affected crop loan disbursements as well, with banks waiting for the waiver money to come in,” Navle said.
