Kolkata: The special task force of Kolkata Police, which specializes in anti-terror operations, is likely to travel to New Delhi to question a British national who was influenced by al-Qaida in 2013 and travelled extensively between Bangladesh, Bengal and Jharkhand to form a network.

 Delhi Police claims the accused — Samiun Rahman alias Hamdan alias Shumon Haq alias Raju Bhai of London — had been to two northeastern states and Bangladesh to indoctrinate Rohingya Muslims. “In 2013, he was influenced by al-Qaida ideology and obtained three weeks’ training at its camp in Syria. Their group came to know about ‘atrocities’ on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. With his Bangladesh background, he was selected to raise a fighter group there. In 2014, he arrived in Bangladesh to radicalize youths to join al-Qaida,”a Delhi Police release had claimed.
 
 Sources said Samiun entered India in July 2017 to set up bases in Mizoram and Manipur to raise funds for Rohingya Muslims “He reportedly stayed at madrassas in Kishanganj, Hazaribagh, Malda and Delhi. STF will help central agencies check his antecedents,” said an STF officer.
