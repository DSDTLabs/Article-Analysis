MUMBAI/BENGALURU: A Mumbai geneticist's gold ornaments worth Rs 3 lakh were stolen last week while she was attending a science conference at a five-star hotel in Bengaluru.

The geneticist has 30 years' experience and has been head of the department at Dr Lal Path Labs, Metropolis, Kokilaben Ambani Hospital and iGenetic Diagnostics.
 
  Mehta had removed her gold jewellery and put it in her purse, by her side, on May 24. She was listening to other speakers when the theft took place.
 
  After the day's scheduled lectures, Mehta returned to her hotel room and found that the jewellery was missing from her purse. "I immediately alerted the organisers. CCTV footage from the hall showed a man stealing it from my purse while I was still there. To my shock, he was present in the participants' photograph. He stole the gold in less than 10 minutes," she told TOI.
 
 Maninderjit Singh, exhibition manager of the conference, said entry to the hall was restricted to select participants.  , security manager at   hotel, which hosted the conference, said there was no security lapse on their part.
