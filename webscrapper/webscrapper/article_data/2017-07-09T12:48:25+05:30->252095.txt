COLVA: Former tourism minister Francisco ‘Mickky’ Pacheco on Saturday alleged that the Congress was responsible for the desecration of crosses in recent times.

 Briefing mediapersons in Margao on Saturday, he said that Catholics were scared to raise their voices with the knowledge that the BJP government in the   would target them.
 
 “Division is being created amongst the minority community by our own people so as to show the government in bad light. This has also been done before,” he said.
 
 While urging the government to immediately arrest the trend of vandalising of crosses and temples and book the culprits, he said that the (Congress) party had come to power, earlier,  
 
 Pacheco said that he was aware who had come to Goa and who was showing them places to vandalise. 
 
 “Goans are involved in the desecration by engaging others and the Congress is behind it,” he alleged.
 
 When questioned if he had informed the police about having knowledge about the perpetrators, he shot back saying, “Let the authorities arrest me for withholding information. Congress has thrown me behind bars earlier and I am not a stranger to sitting in jail.”
 
 The former   also said that the   during the by-elections to Betalbatim panchayat were rigged by officials appointed by the state election commission and he demanded a recount in both wards. Pacheco said that if this was not done, he would file a petition in the tribunal to seek justice to the candidate who lost due to faulty counting.
 
 “Before declaring the results, votes were juggled due to which my candidates lost the elections,”said Pacheco. He added that his candidate Inacina Maria Fernandes will file a complaint.
