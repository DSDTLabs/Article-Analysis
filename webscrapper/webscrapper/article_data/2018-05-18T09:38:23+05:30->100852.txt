CHANDIGARH: Reacting to political developments in Karnataka, Punjab chief minister Captain   on Thursday “condemned” the Karnataka governor for “subverting the Constitution and massacring the democratic polity to serve the desire and will of his political masters—the Bharatiya Janata Party ( )”. He said, “What else do you expect from an RSS governor?”

 Amarinder said he was concerned over what he termed as “brazen shamelessness” with which Karnataka governor Vajubhai Rudhabhai Vala had “murdered India’s democracy and the Constitution” by calling the minority party to form the government in state.
 
 He added that it was shocking the way the governor had given time to the BJP to break the opposition and resort to horse trading, said Amarinder. He, however, quipped, “What else do you expect from an RSS governor?”
 
 Amarinder said the situation was not only sad, but also extremely dangerous for India. “We do not want India to become like Pakistan, where democracy is subverted by dictators and the Army every step of the way,” he told a group of media persons.
 
 “The entire nation wants to know from the Karnataka governor by what logic he chose to invite the minority BJP to form the government when recent precedents in Goa and Manipur clearly were in favour of going for a majority post-poll alliance in case of a hung poll verdict,”   Singh said, adding, “People are now looking towards the Supreme Court for upholding the Constitutional principles.”
