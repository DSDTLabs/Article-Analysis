CUTTACK: Doctors at   Medical Ccollege and Hospital have given a new life to a   (changed name) by successfully conducting a sex change surgery on her. A team of plastic surgeons conducted the sex reassignment surgery on May 8 and the patient is now recovering. "She is fine now. We will keep her under observation for four to five days and then discharge her," said head of SCBs plastic surgery wing  . 

 This is for the second time that a sex change surgery has been carried out successfully at the government-run medical college and hospital. Choudhary said that the procedure costs nothing less than Rs 5 lakh at any private hospital but at SCB the expenditure was only Rs 50,000. "As Arati belongs to the BPL category her treatment expenses were borne by the state government under   (OSTF)," said Choudhary.
 
 After undergoing the surgery, 30-year-old Arati is on cloud nine and has chalked out plans to make her life better. "I was not able to complete my studies due to social stigma. After recovering, I will focus on my studies and will lead a life of dignity," said Arati, who did odd jobs to earn her livelihood. Explaining about the procedure, doctors said Arati had to undergo hormone therapies and provided psychiatric counseling. She was admitted to SCB on April 21.
