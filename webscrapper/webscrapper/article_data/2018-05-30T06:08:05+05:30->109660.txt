CHANDIGARH: The police challaned 2,455 persons for modifying their motorcycles to create loud noise in five months and 133 bikers in a week, the   and   high court was told on Tuesday during the hearing into the PIL seeking stricter implementation of the rule banning modified motorcycles producing a high-decibel noise. 

 The highest number of challans was issued in south east division - 47 out of the 133 in a week
 
 The petitioner, a city resident, had submitted before the HC that people were openly flouting traffic norms by getting silencers of their bikes removed and modified to produce a jarring noise which scares passers-by and creates noise pollution. It was also submitted that the modified bikes also create noise pollution by pressure horns, giving a succession of unduly harsh, shrill, loud and alarming noise. The petitioner has sought directions to the administration to take preventive measures by spreading awareness among residents on the use of modified bikes. Many bikers are unaware that alteration of a factory model is illegal under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
 
 After the HC became stricter on the traffic violation, the court imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 on 22 traffic violators challaned for non-functional silencers creating noise pollution. They were challaned under Section 192 (2) of Motor Vehicle Act 1988, 
 
 Traffic police have also started telling spare-part dealers and automobile mechanics not to modify motorcycles for producing a loud, popping sound. Cops had also written to the senior superintendents of police of the neighboring   and Ropar for a check on the mechanics, since most of the noise-making motorcycles caught in Chandigarh had been modified in these Punjab towns.
