MUMBAI: A session court that convicted and sentenced 40-year-old model Preeti Jain to three years   for conspiring to kill director  , has denied her claims that she was falsely implicated at the director's behest. 

 The court denied Jain's claims that co-convict (the man to whom she the gave the supari) Naresh Pardeshi's narco analysis report showed Bhandarkar had paid him Rs 50,000 to falsely implicate her. The court said the test report cannot be relied upon, and there was no recovery on the basis of information elicited during such test.
 
 Pardeshi earlier worked with ganster Arun Gawli's Akhil Bharatiya Sena (ABS). Anil Tawade, a party worker, told the court Jain visited the office on September 2, 2005 and told him about the conspiracy. Tawade, in turn, related this to lawyer and office-bearer Mahendra Bagwe. Bagwe told the court he informed Gawli, who then asked him to immediately contact police.
 
 Jain also alleged that while in police custody, cops told her they are registering a false case against her and Gawali was the target and she should turn approver. The court said even if Gawli was the target, in the absence of her contact with him, there would be no question of making her an approver.
 
 The court said leniency could not have been granted to her only on grounds of her gender. "Merely, on the ground of gender if offence is proved discrimination cannot be made," the court said. 
 
 Jain's rape case against Bhandarkar was quashed by the Supreme Court in 2012. The court however said other circumstances need to be considered while decided the sentence. It pointed out that Jain had ordered the hit in an attempt to seek revenge after her failed attempts to get Bhandarkar's anticipatory bail cancelled in the rape case she had filed against him.
