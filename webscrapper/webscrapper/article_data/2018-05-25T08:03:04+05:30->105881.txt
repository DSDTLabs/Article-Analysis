CHANDIGARH: The general house of the municipal corporation that assembled on Thursday deferred the agenda item about cancelling the private contract for running the city’s paid-parking lots because the new municipal commissioner wanted time to study the issue.

 The finance and contract committee (F&CC) of the   has recommended cancelling the contract with the private company, but the matter was brought to the general house for decision. “The MC has to consider multiple legal and financial implications and I need time to study its details,” the new commissioner said in the house. “My request to you all (members of the general house) is to let me go through the case. We’ll do whatever the house sees fit.”
 
 During the discussion, the municipal councillors who inspected the paid-parking lots and prepared a report of all the anomalies asked the commissioner not to give any relief to the company. “The   lots are not smart at all and are full of anomalies. The visitors get overcharged but they get no smart service. Neither further inspection nor any new instruction to the company is required. Cancel the contract,” former mayor Rajbala Malik said. She is head of the inspection committee.
 
 Mayor   agreed that the company had not been running the lots as warranted by the agreement, and so it deserved to be chucked out.
