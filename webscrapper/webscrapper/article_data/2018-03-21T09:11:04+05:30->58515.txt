KOLKATA: Mizoram began their   campaign in style, overturning a 0-1deficit to brush aside Goa 3-1 in a Group B match at the   on Tuesday.

 
 Six-time champions Goa forged ahead in the 11th minute through veteran Victorino Fernandes. However, Mizoram regrouped quickly and equalised 14 minutes later when F. Lalrinpuia swooped on an opportunity and shot home from a melee. They emerged stronger and more determined after the break and scored twice in the space of four minutes through Lal Romawia and seal the deal.
 
 “I am stunned to note that my boys could not play their natural game. They simply faded in the second half,” Goa coach Armando Colaco said after his team’s abject surrender.
 
 Former India midfielder Joaquim Abranches was on left on the bench even as Armando started with two experienced players Victorino and   as Goa controlled the early exchanges. Victorino, who spurned an opportunity in the fifth minute, however, made amends six minutes later. Set up nicely by Marcus Mascarenhas, Victorino controlled the ball inside the box and beat Mizoram goalkeeper Laltanpuia Ralte with ease.
 
 Mizoram’s reaction to the setback was immediate. They launched quick counter-attacks to unsettle their opponents and one such offensive saw Lalmuanzova move up the left channel before floating a perfect cross into the box. Mizoram striker Lal Remruate missed its flight while Lalbiakhlua — who had an outstanding game — had his shot blocked by Goa custodian Ozen Vivian Silva. However, Lalrinpuia who was lurking in the box, slammed home past a jungle of legs.
