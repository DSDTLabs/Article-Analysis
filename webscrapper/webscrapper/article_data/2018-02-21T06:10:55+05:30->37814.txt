Actress   says   frontman   is "gorgeous", and she feels his looks have improved "with time".

  
  
 "I'm going to talk about Chris Martin. He was with   (Johnson), they're a couple. Got it? He's gorgeous. That face got better with time. He was wearing a hat like this ... it was to die for," Keaton said on a talk show. 
 
 Reportedly, while Keaton is a huge fan of the   hitmaker, she didn't know he was the 40-year-old singer when she came face to face with him at  's birthday party. She only found out his identity "a couple of days" after star-studded bash.
 
 Asked if Keaton knew who Martin was, she said: "I didn't. That's the other problem. I didn't know who he was. But I saw him and I noticed he was gorgeous but I had no idea until a couple of days later when someone said, 'Did you know?'
 
 "How about that? How could I not have known it was him?"
 
 The   actress also enjoyed meeting singer  .
