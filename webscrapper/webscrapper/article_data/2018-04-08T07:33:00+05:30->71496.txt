LUDHIANA: The court of judicial magistrate Jagjit Singh adjourned the hearing of a defamation case lodged by senior   (SAD) leader Bikram Singh   against AAP Rajya Sabha member   until April 25. AAP supremo   has already apologized to Majithia in the same case and is not facing trial now. 

 Majithia had filed a defamation case against senior AAP leader Sanjay Singh in the Ludhiana court on January 12, for calling him a ‘drug lord’, and accused him of being associated with the drugs trade in the state. Himmat Singh Shergill, counsel for Sanjay Singh, said his client had sought exemption from personal hearing for a day, and as a result, did not attend the hearing on Saturday.
 
 He added that Sanjay was fighting the case, and would be present in the court in the next hearing. Sanjay’s counsel said even Majithia did not appear in all the case hearings, adding that there was no question of apology from his client, and they would fight the case until the end. Meanwhile, Majithia’s counsel   said they were also not withdrawing the case against AAP leader Sanjay Singh, and would take the same to its logical conclusion. He added that the case was adjourned to April 25.
 
 Delhi chief minister Kejriwal’s apology had created major uproar in the party’s   unit. However AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh has refused to apologize and said he stood by his allegations. Sanjay — who is also facing two defamation cases filed by Majithia — said there was no question of retracting his statements regarding the SAD leader’s involvement in narcotics trade in Punjab.
