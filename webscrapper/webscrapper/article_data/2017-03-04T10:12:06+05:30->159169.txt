PUDUKKOTTAI: The people of   have lost hope in the state government, said   addressing the villagers protesting against the   on Friday. He was referring to the continuing protest despite an assurance given by chief minister   that the government will not allow the project to be implemented.

 He alleged that the state government failed to represent public sentiment pertaining to the project to the  .
 
 Leaders across party lines are supporting the protest, said Stalin. He compared the stir with the pro-jallikattu protests. He alleged that this issue was not a priority for the state government as the chief minister failed to discuss the matter during his recent meeting with Prime Minister Modi. "The hydrocarbon project was not included in the list of 23 grievances handed over to Modi. But when he spoke to the media, he said he had discussed the project with the Prime Minister," he said.
 
 On allegations made by   that the DMK was responsible for the project as it was approved when the party had been in power, Stalin clarified that they had signed an MoU only to grant permission for a study, not for a methane exploration or extraction project.
 
 Taking a dig at Stalin, PMK leader and Lok Sabha MP Anbumani Ramadoss said it was ironic that Stalin was expressing solidarity with the protesters, since it was the DMK that allowed the hydrocarbon project. Anbumani said that the delta region should be declared as a special agriculture zone to curb its implementation.
