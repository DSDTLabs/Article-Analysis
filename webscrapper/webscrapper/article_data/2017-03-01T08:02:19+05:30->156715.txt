KOCHI: A team of 16 including 8  , 3 backstage singers and 5 children will perform a   based on Gracy's `Ethu Josephinte Katha; Annayudeyum' at the   on Wednesday as a part of the `Theruvarangu' event.

 “Although the script is fundamentally based on Gracy's story, we have improvised the script, adding the personal and subjective elements of the participants of the theatre. All the main actors are 35 plus and are either homemakers or working women who have kids. They are performing on stage for the first time ­ we inculcated scenes and acts into the play so as to accommodate their kids as well, so that they won't feel uncomfortable leaving their children back home,“ said Asha Devi, director of the play.
 
 The actors in the theatre were chosen from the participants in a camp held by the women's wing of Centre for Contemporary Art, a non-governmental organization in the city for developing budding theatre artists.
 
 “I am a grandmother and I don't have my children or my grandchildren with me at home. I was so bored that even though I was apprehensive about the whole idea initially, I decided to join the crew. And I can't be happier about the decision I've made; it has been so very exciting!“ said Susie, an actor in the play.
