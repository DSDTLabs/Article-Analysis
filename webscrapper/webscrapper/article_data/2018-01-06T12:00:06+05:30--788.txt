CHANDIGARH: A spot next to Pracheen Shiv Mandir, Sector 42C, has been a source of   for devotees visiting the temple and people living nearby for long.

 The spot, located on a street corner, has transformed into a makeshift dumping ground for   and construction, without anyone paying heed to the consequences it entails. “This place smells bad all day. We have asked people so many times not to dump their garbage here, but no one seems to listen,” said Prashant, a temple caretaker.
 
 The spot is plagued with rotting vegetables, fruit peels, plastic waste and bags, food packets, and so on. “It is foggy these days. So, when dew falls, garbage gets wet and foul smell starts emanating from it,” added a nearby resident.
 
 Prashant said monsoon is the   for time. “Wet garbage smells horrible. It is hard to believe, but this is our in a city like Chandigarh,” Prashant said.
 
 Apart from neighbourhood waste which is collected and dumped at the spot, a large amount of waste from the Sector 42C market is also dumped here; it has worsened the smell. “This is right next to the boundary wall of houses here; imagine how do they feel?” asked a passerby, who lives nearby.
 
 A sanitation worker, who did not wish to be named, said they collected garbage dumped at the spot and it disposed it of regularly. “We cannot stop people from dumping here, though,” the worker added.
