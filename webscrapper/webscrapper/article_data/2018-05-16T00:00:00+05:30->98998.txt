In a bid to keep the city clean and spread awareness about the same, city-based   Let’s Be The Change organised a musical   on Tuesday. Members of the NGO along with employees of an IT company took part in the event, held in  . Volunteers chose to fix a spot that had become a garbage dump. Right from cleaning the spot to beautifying it, volunteers left no stone unturned. And the best part — a musical performance by a band called Kalatva.

That way they will not throw garbage anywhere,” says Anirudh S Dutt, founder and president, Let’s Be The Change. So, does a cleanup drive like this actually help? “Absolutely.

Two, to bridge in the gap between the BBMP authorities and the members of the society, and three, a musical performance like this will not only create awareness, but will also encourage more people to do the same,” says Anirudh adding, “When people hear the  , they will be curious and that’s when we will talk to them. It’s our contribution towards beautifying the city and people are free to join us.” The group, says Anirudh, will now gear up for more such cleanathons in the coming months.
