LUCKNOW: The   government has said that the body of a non-government person can’t be wrapped in the Tricolour as it violates the Indian National Flag Code, 2002. The government’s move comes a fortnight after photographs of the funeral procession of Kasganj communal violence victim Chandan Gupta getting wrapped in Tricolour went viral on social media. 

 “The flag shall not be used as a drapery in any form whatsoever except in State/Military/Central Paramilitary Forces funerals herein after provided. The flag shall not be used as a drapery in any form whatsoever, including private funerals,” according to Section V of the Flag Code of India. 
 
 Chief minister  , in a written submission to the  , has also said the flag of any organization cannot be put above the national flag. VHP and   men had reportedly carried saffron flags along with the Tricolour during the ‘tiranga yatra’ on Republic Day when the violence broke out. 
 
 Yogi’s submission has come in response to a query by SP legislator Shashank Yadav. On Tuesday,   had raised the query, but could not be taken up for discussion as there was pandemonium over law and order and fake encounters in the state. 
 
 Yadav said the issue was important following reports of national flag code violations in UP. “The CM’s response proves that the code was violated in Kasganj. His killing was unfortunate. But he wasn’t a government official, so his body shouldn’t have been wrapped in the national flag,” Yadav toldTOI on Wednesday.
