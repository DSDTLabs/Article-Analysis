 says that she always follows the instructions of her directors, especially when it comes to south films. The actress shares the reason why she is more dependent on filmmakers while she’s doing projects in Tamil or Telugu. “I know the pulse of Hindi audience, thanks to my bringing up in north. But I’m not that adept in the understanding of culture and sensibilities of audience down south. Hence, I rely on my directors more while acting in Tamil and Telugu movies. I understand Telugu more compared to Tamil as I have done almost double the films in   than  ,” she says.
