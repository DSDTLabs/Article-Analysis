Hyderabad: In yet another run-in with global drug regulators, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories ( )’s API unit in UK has now come under the scanner of the United States Food and Drug Administration, which has raised concerns over current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) at the unit.

 “The audit of our API Mirfield Plant, United Kingdom, by the USFDA has been completed today (on Friday). We have been issued Form 483 with three observations, which we are addressing,” the company informed the bourses on Friday. According to USFDA, Form 483 is issued to a firm at the conclusion of an inspection when the investigator has observed any conditions that in their judgement may constitute violations of the Food Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act and related Acts. The FDA Form 483 notifies the company’s management of objectionable conditions. In fact, last week, German regulatory authority Regierung von Oberbayern too had raised concerns about cGMP violations at DRL’s formulations manufacturing unit at Duvvada in Vizag and concluded its audit with zero critical but six major observations. In August, the company's formulations manufacturing Unit-2 in Bachupally too had come under German regulator’s lens.
