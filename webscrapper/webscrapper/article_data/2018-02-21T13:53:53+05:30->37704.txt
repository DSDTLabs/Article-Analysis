NAGPUR: When students entered   in   from the main gate on Tuesday morning, they had no idea that, in just a couple of hours, it was going to be completely blocked because of digging work by a road contractor.

 School authorities too were shocked when news came in about a deep pit right in front of the gate, making it unusable. With hardly an hour left for school to get over and almost 2,000 students still inside, the principal faced an unusual situation. 
 
 Talking to TOI, Fr. Prashant said, “There was no intimation at all and the work started suddenly. I went up to the people who were working and they said it will be over by 3pm. Our school gets off at 1.40pm.”
 
 The principal did not get satisfactory answers as there was no senior official present on site. “Luckily, we have two other exit points and I immediately directed my staff to ensure that there is no panic,” said  .
 
 Students exited the school from the   gate (Kamptee road) and the   which connects Residency Road and   Road. While Fr. Prashant’s administrative skills saved the day, there is no denying that exit of thousands of students, that too with the main exit gate blocked, could have led to a major problem.
 
 A parent, who had come to pick up his son, said, “What would have happened if there was only one gate? The contractor did not know about extra gates and simply went on with the work.” Fr. Prashant agreed saying, “This work could have been done on Sunday and Monday (state holiday) and it would not have been an issue. Regardless, had we been aware of this road work then proper planning could have been done.” 
 
 TOI spoke with the site supervisor who said that his boss was not in town and he had been asked to carry the work. The Haryana-based construction company was shifting water pipeline on Residency Road so that the proposed flyover construction can be carried out without hindrance.
