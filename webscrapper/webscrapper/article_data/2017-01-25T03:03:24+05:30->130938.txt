NEW DELHI: Scientists will measure the   afresh to determine whether the massive 2015 earthquake in Nepal really did knock an inch off the world’s tallest peak.   Swarna Subba   said on Tuesday that a team of scientists would be sent to Nepal in the hope of putting to rest a debate about the true height of the mountain. 

 “Everest’s height was declared, if I remember correctly, in 1855. Many others also measured it. But the height given by Survey of India, even today, is taken as the correct height. It is 29,028 ft,” he said.“We are re-measuring it. It is almost two years since the  . Since then, there is a doubt in the scientific community that it is shrinking. That is one of the reasons. The second reason is, it helps in scientific studies, plate movements etc,” he added.
 
 The expedition is likely to set off in two months, Rao said. Rao added that the measurement would be conducted by two methods for “better confirmation” of the height. “One is GPS. It is a survey instrument. It looks like a transistor. If you put it on the summit, say for 10 minutes, it tells you the height... The second is, ground method. Triangulation. We observe. The height can be calculated from the ground,” he added.
