The Hindi version of ‘
 ’ is making as much impact as the Tamil and Telugu versions down South. The S.S. Rajamouli film has surpassed even the biggest Bollywood flicks and is on the road to rewrite history. The film collected about Rs 9.50 crore on its third Friday taking its total to Rs 395.50 crore which is in itself a huge number, as reported by Boxofficeindia.com. It’s yet another record in the long list of records already broken by the film as ‘Dangal’ held the highest third Friday slot at Rs 6.50 crore which is now far less than the magnum opus’s numbers.

 
 
 ‘Baahubali 2: The Conclusion’ has already smashed every record that existed by churning the most astonishing numbers at the ticket counters. The film starring   in the title role,   as Bhalla Deva,   as Sivamani and Anushka Shetty as Deva Sena had collected a whopping Rs 245 crore in the first week and Rs 141 crore in the second week for the Hindi version alone.
 
 It has now beaten the highest Bollywood grosser including ‘3 Idiots’, ‘Dhoom 3’, ‘PK’, ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ and ‘Dangal’. The film marks the conclusion of the Baahubali franchise by finally putting to rest the most asked question, “Why did Katappa kill Baahubali?”
