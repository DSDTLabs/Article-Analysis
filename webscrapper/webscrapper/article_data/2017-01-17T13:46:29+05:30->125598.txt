THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   (MMA) slammed the   to include magic as a   at the   from next year, saying that it would destroy the reputation of their art. MMA state general secretary Nizar Kadambari said that such a decision will affect the livelihood of nearly 3,000 magicians in Kerala.

 “The success of magic depends on secrecy. If school children are permitted to perform magic at competition venues, the secrecy will be lost and the relevance of the art will fade,“ he said at a press meet on Monday.
 
 Magician Samraj alleged the involvement of a magic equipment dealers' mafia behind this decision. “The decision was taken by the government without even holding a discussion with magicians. If it is implemented, magic will become just another art to be performed by anybody anywhere.Children will be trained in magic not because they have interest but just for the sake of getting grace marks. Thus, the demand for magic teachers and magic equipment will increase,“ he said.
 
 Samraj added that the children will have a tendency to reveal secrets to friends and relatives, which is akin to the art being killed by the artist themselves. “At competition venues, each item will be subjected to detailed analysis, not only by the judges, but also the audience including the media. The increasing revelations of magic's secrecy through magic classes via internet and other media have already become a challenge for us. It will be pointless to present magic before people, if they already know the secret behind it. Our livelihood will be affected,“ he said.
 
 MMA has asked the government to drop its plan to make magic a competition item, saying that they will conduct a state-level protest against the decision.
