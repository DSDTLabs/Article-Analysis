NEW DELHI: While   want the Union housing and urban affairs ministry to provide relief from the ongoing   in Delhi, the minister Hardeep Puri on Monday said the ministry is not “directly involved” in the matter.

 When asked about what the ministry plans to do, Puri said, “It is a concern. But Delhi is a union territory. The NDMC reports to the home ministry and the three civic bodies report to the Delhi government. As for the housing and urban affairs ministry, we are not directly involved with this.”
 
 However, BJP members said they are hopeful the ministry will do something in the upcoming parliament session to provide relief to lakhs of traders and property owners in the city. Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari had recently formed a three-member committee with MPs Ramesh Bidhuri and Parvesh Verma and Vijender Gupta, leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly, as members.
 
 Though Delhi leaders have taken up the matter with party chief Amit Shah and the minister, sources say the committee will soon formally present its demand to the minister.
