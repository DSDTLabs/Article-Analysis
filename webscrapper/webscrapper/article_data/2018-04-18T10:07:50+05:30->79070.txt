LUCKNOW: In a joint operation, Lucknow and Gujarat police arrested five persons from Udaipur, Rajasthan, on Tuesday and rescued three businessmen held hostage. The accused were sent to jail in Gujarat. Lucknow police had applied for warrant of the accused to interrogate them in a March 1 case in which they had abducted and duped four businessmen by promising to sell them special goggles with which one could see seven feet below the ground.

 The accused were identified as Ramji Bhai, Bhavesh Bhai, Dilip Bhai and Arif, all of Gujarat, and Bhanu Pratap of Bahraich.
 
 The rescued businessmen Vinod, Sarfaraz and Imran, from Gujarat, disclosed that the gang had taken Rs 10 lakh from them after luring them to purchase special goggles, a diamond studded necklace of Nepal’s royal family, which was in possession of a couple in Lucknow.
 
 ASP trans-Gomti Harendra Kumar said that the accused had on March 1 taken four businessmen Suresh Bhai, Jayendra Bhai, Mayank Bhai and Ketan Bhai from Gujarat hostage in Lucknow. The victims managed to flee by jumping from the moving car in Jankipuram. Ketan had suffered injuries while jumping and was admitted to KGMU where he died on March 9.
 
 Lucknow police later arrested   of Bahraich in this connection on March 5.
 
 On April 15, one   of Gandhinagar visited ASP trans-Gomti and informed him that his brother   was also lured by Ramji and Bhavesh to Lucknow on January 6. They took Rs 15 lakh from him, held him captive and thrashed him. “Bhupendra managed to flee and reached home but succumbed to injuries on January 14,” said Pate.
