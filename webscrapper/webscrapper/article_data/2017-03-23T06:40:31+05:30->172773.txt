 DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old man died on Wednesday after the two-wheeler he was riding met with an accident on Balliwala flyover. The incident has left the local residents angry who said that this is the fourth life that the flyover has claimed in the past five months. 

  Residents said that the two-lane flyover was very narrow which was leading to frequent accidents and demanded that a divider be constructed along the 783m structure to improve traffic flow . 
 
  Mahesh Pandey, a resident of  , said, "I have a written a letter to the newly appointed CM  , requesting him to look into the matter. The flyover was thrown open to traffic in July and since then several accidents have taken place here. The flyover was originally suppose to be four-lane but it is so narrow that it has turned into an accident-prone area." 
 
  In the latest accident, Yuvraj Rai died on Wednesday after the two-wheeler he was riding skidded on the flyover on March 18. His 18-year- old cousin who was riding pillion is in a hospital in Delhi in a critical condition. 
 
  Dhirendra Gunjyal, SP Traffic, told TOI, "I had asked senior National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) senior officials to construct a divider on the flyover but they have not done that. In fact I also suggested that if they can't construct a concrete flyover then they can use plastic structures. I will be consulting them again to find a solution." 
 
  NHAI officials said that no divider can be constructed on the flyover and drivers need to be cautious about speeding. 
 
  Mahipal Rawat, executive engineer, NHAI, told TOI, "The two-lane flyover doesn't have room for more construction. People have to be cautious and speeding and drunk driving should be avoided." 
 
  In November 2016, two people who were travelling on a bike on the flyover, which connects GMS Road to  , met with an accident and died. Another two-wheeler rider died on January 2017 in another accident.
