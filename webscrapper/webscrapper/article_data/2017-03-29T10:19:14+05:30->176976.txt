 “Subsequently,” the letter read, “the AAI team discussed the matter with DRDO, Chandigarh, and have decided to revise the recommendations considering the practical constraints in the existing MLCP. AAI is in the process of appointing a structural consultant for implementation of revised recommendations of DRDO.”
 
 The MLCP building constructed by AAI at Dabolim airport has a facility to accommodate 540 cars at a time. 
 
 However, though this building was completed a couple of years ago along with the integrated terminal building of Dabolim international airport, the facility was not put to use owing to certain security issues raised by BCAS.
 
 In a meeting held recently, members of Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) had urged Sawaikar to seek approval from BCAS to make the facility operational.
