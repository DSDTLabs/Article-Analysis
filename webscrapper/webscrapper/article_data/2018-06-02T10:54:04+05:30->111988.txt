  : In apparent signs of fissures in farmer organisations, Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) general secretary   on Friday hit out at   leader Shivkumar Sharma ' ' for allegedly hijacking gaon bandh stir. 

 Yadav said much before Kakkaji started talking about farmers' agitation, he (Anil Yadav) had called a press conference and announced the gaon bandh. "It's my fielding, my players, but suddenly Kakkaji becomes captain of the game," he said in a laughing manner. He claimed the BKU network has mobilised farmers across the state for agitation, but Kakkaji is trying to take the credit for it.
 
  When the agitation is over after June 10, the BKU would start working on a different agri business model in villages."We want end of the mandi system. We don't want farmers to reach mandi, where they are exploited. From June 10 onwards, farmers will sell their produce at villages. The farmers would also decide their rates," he announced. 
 
 Kakkaji refused to comment on Yadav's allegation. He said every farmer was his leader and he was just working for betterment of farmers. "My only aim is to ensure farmers get justice and right price for their produce. Their loans should be waived," he said. 
 
 The differences apart, they were in agreement on one thing: the government was "trying to crush farmers' peaceful agitation".
 
 Kakkaji said, "Farmers are holding peaceful agitation, but the government has instigated farmers by distributing lathis to police personnel. There was a message in it." "Like last year, the agitation will intensify in coming days, when more and more farmers will join the agitation," he said.
