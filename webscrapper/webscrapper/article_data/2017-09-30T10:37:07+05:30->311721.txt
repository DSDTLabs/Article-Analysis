COIMBATORE: Unidentified person snatched a   chain weighing 9.5 sovereigns from a 72 -year-old retired government doctor, who was out on an evening walk, on Wednesday evening.

 According to police, when K Sundarammal, of   in  , had gone for walk around 5pm on Wednesday, an unknown person followed her and snatched the gold chain from her.
 
 Though Sundarammal raised an alarm, he managed to escape from the spot. She subsequently alerted the police, who have formed a special team to nab the miscreant.
 
 The police said they were yet to get any lead as there weren’t any CCTV cameras in the area.
 
 “Chain snatchers often target elderly woman as they can easily escape from the spot,” the police said. Areas such as Thudiyalur, Vadavalli, Pollachi and rural parts of Coimbatore had in the past reported several cases of motorcycle-borne chain snatchers.
 
 “Youths, who don’t have any criminal background, are also involved chain snatching. For them, elderly women are easy targets. The anti-chain snatching squad in the city has stepped up its efforts to curb   incidents,” the police said.
