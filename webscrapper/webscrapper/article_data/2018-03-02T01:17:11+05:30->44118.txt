NOIDA: In order to streamline   in the city, the   on Thursday invited suggestions from the public on its proposal to change the building bylaws.

 As per the proposal, the Authority wants to make it mandatory for all individual residential plot owners to have   to accommodate their vehicles. In addition, all group housing developers will have to provide one parking space for every 50 square metres as compared to the current norm of one parking space for every 80 square metres of space bought by  .
 
 The idea is to make it mandatory for property owners to create parking space on their own premises rather having vehicles parked on the city’s roads, said Authority officials.
 
 “Once we receive suggestions and objections from the people, we will clear them before amending our building bylaws 2010,”  , chief architect planner, Noida Authority, told TOI. 
 
 “Once implemented, all our residential plot and group housing allottees will have to abide by the norms and no layout plan of a building will be approved if the new bylaws are not followed,” he said.
 
 Mishra explained that until now, it was optional and depended on the allottee whether they wanted to create stilt parking or not for individual plot owners above 112 metres. If property owners opted for stilt parking, they were allowed to build an extra floor. 
 
 “However, if the bylaws are amended, all plot owners above and below 112 metres will have to build stilt parking to accommodate their vehicles,” he said. “For group housing societies, if a buyer has a flat measuring 100 square metres, they will be eligible for two parking spaces as against the current norm of one parking space,” he added.
 
 “The aim is to create more parking space in residential areas. We have invited suggestions and objections against the move in the next 15 days from all stakeholders,” Mishra added.
