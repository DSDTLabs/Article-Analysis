IDUKKI: Power minister   on Sunday hit out at   leaders alleging that they had a bad track record of misbehaving with women. He told reporters at Kunchithanni on Sunday that almost all Congress leaders were involved in sexual abuse cases while few Communist leaders created such controversies. "Even the seniors Congress leaders in the country are involved in such cases," he said. 

 Mani's attack against Congress leaders came at a time when a section of women plantation workers under the banner of Pembilai Orumai here are protesting against the minister, demanding his apology and resignation for his curt remarks against them. 
 
 "CPM has always respected women but I personally know many Congress leaders who are involved in abuse cases," Mani said, adding that it would be better not to speak about it more for the sake of decency. 
 
 He also referred to the incident in which a woman was brutally abused and killed inside the Congress office in  . "I remember how   and his party handled that issue," he said. Mani said   leader Shobha Surendran and Congress leader Lathika Subhash, who were eager to express solidarity with Pembilai Orumai leaders, were mum on the issue. He also referred to the death of  , and its alleged connection with her husband and MP Shashi Tharoor. 
 
 "The case against Tharoor is still going on and people do not know what happened in it. I was taken to task because of the media who twisted my statements against the women workers," Mani said. 
 
 "What is more, the very word solar says it all," he said, pointing out that Congress leadership, instead of punishing those involved in the case, promoted them. He said that he did not move a finger to end Pembilai Orumai's strike.
 
 Meanwhile, the Pembilai Orumai leaders who ended their hunger strike and kick-started an agitation from Saturday night, are receiving a poor response from political parties and activists. On Sunday, no political parties or groups visited them in their pandal at Munnar.
