BHOPAL: With the  , the Adolescent Friendly Helpline has been flooded with calls from the teenagers who are reeling under exam related stress these days.

 The helpline was launched by the National Health Mission (NHM) in 2013 to address the grievances of adolescents through a battery of counsellors over phone. The main objective of the helpline is to provide counselling over adolescent health issues. “Since the board examination are about to kick off, most of the calls we receive these days are related to exam blues. We get around 130 calls daily, of which 100 calls are related to board exams. Students complain that they are reeling under stress, as they are unable to complete their course in subjects like Maths and Physics,” said Melkha Shrivastava, MP coordinator of the helpline ((1800 233 1250). Interestingly, prior to the Valentine’s Days early this month, the helpline also received calls about what gifts boys should buy for girls.
 
 The helpline received 171 distress calls from youngsters who were upset for different reasons and wanted to commit suicide in the last three years. “We received 171 calls from distressed youngsters who wanted to end their lives,” said Shrivastava, adding that the calls were received between 2013 and 2016. “We make all efforts to address the grievances of the youngsters. As we do not have the facility for calling a person back, at times we use our cell phone to contact the caller just to ensure that he does not resort to the extreme step,” said Shrivastava. She added that the phone calls are not restricted to MP. Distressed youngsters from other states like Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Gujarat also seek counselling from the helpline. A city-based psychologist, Ritu Nanda, said, “The youngsters are looking for immediate redressal and proper counselling can save them from taking the extreme step.”
