LUCKNOW: There was no respite from the unusually warm   on Sunday as minimum   shot seven degrees above normal, making Saturday night the hottest of this year.

 Maximum temperatures have been higher then normal for 10 days now.
 
 
  
 
 Weather in February generally remains pleasant. However, due to western disturbance, nights are abnormally hot as of now. Normally, such high temperatures are seen during April.
 
 People have not only shed woollens, but are forced to switch on fans and even ACs.
 
 Maximum temperature on Sunday was 31degrees Celsius, three degrees above normal, while minimum temperature was 19.4 degrees, seven degrees above normal.
 
 Relief is expected on Monday as temperatures are expected to fall by one-two degrees. Sky will be mainly clear with mist in the morning, while maximum and minimum temperatures would be around 30 and 17 degrees Celsius respectively.
 
 
 Met officials said night temperatures were high because of cloudy sky. Clouds prevent heat from the ground to escape in the atmosphere during the night however, the same clouds prevent rise in temperatures during the day, but on Sunday, temperatures were high despite cloudy sky.
 
 
 This was because of warm southeasterly winds.
