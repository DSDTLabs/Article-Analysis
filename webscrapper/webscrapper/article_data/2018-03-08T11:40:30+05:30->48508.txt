PUDUCHERRY: After a 55-year-old man from the coastal hamlet of Vaithikuppam was hacked to death by an armed gang on Tuesday night, scores of his relatives thronged Raj Nivas on Wednesday morning, urging lieutenant governor   to direct the police to arrest the culprits immediately.

 Police said Maran, a private   operator, reached his stand near the government hospital when a gang of armed men attacked him with sharp weapons. Though he tried to flee, he was chased down and hacked to death by the gang members on the Gingee Salai on Tuesday night. Initial inquiries revealed a previous enmity between Maran and one Moorthy, booked by police for his involvement in several cases, as the motive behind the murder. Police have launched a hunt for Moorthy, his wife and aides, who went underground after the assault.
 
 Meanwhile, Bedi, after holding talks with the protesting mob, directed the police to take expeditious action and nab the criminals. She also held a discussion with chief secretary Ashwani Kumar and suggested him to seek the assistance of the state human rightsâ€™ committee to examine police preparedness in preventing any untoward incidents in the territory and fishermen hamlets, in particular.
