Kushinara, as   is known among followers of Buddha, is more than just a tourist spot. It is a place that is a source of energy and inspiration. 

 On any given day, some 200 devotees from Thailand, Burma, China, Cambodia, Japan, China or Sri Lanka may be seen praying in Kushinagar. But this tourist destination has no direct connectivity, a demand of the monks that’s been long pending. But monks know that biradari overshadows   development in Kushinagar.
 
 “What’s lacking is the involvement of locals as well as political will. When we voice our requests, netas promise to take things forward but the pace of growth is slow. Actually, the focus is biradari and not development and that has been the case for the past six decades,” said Bhandante Bhikshu, Gyaneshwar, the chief of   or the Burmese temple.
 
 He said, “I came here in 1954 when the monks were pressing for Kushinagar being declared as a district. But that happened in 1997 during Mayawati’s regime. The airport project has been gathering dust for the past ten years and I don’t know if that will happen in my lifetime.”
 
 Former director of the Baudh Shodh Sansthan Bhiukku Chandima said while foreigners book AC buses, Indian tourists suffer for want of affordable options, despite constituting over 90% of the visitors. “A pilgrim will have to take a bus from Gorakhpur. While foreign Buddhists will find a place to stay in their pagodas, Indian pilgrims have only three hotels, with a total capacity of 60, to choose from,” he said.
 
 TK Roy, who runs a café in Kushinagar for the past 25 years, said, “For years, we have been hearing about the Buddhist circuit plan. Last year, there were talks of a Buddha walk but no plan takes off.” The monks want the Mahaparinirvan sthali to be treated like a temple and not a tourist spot.
