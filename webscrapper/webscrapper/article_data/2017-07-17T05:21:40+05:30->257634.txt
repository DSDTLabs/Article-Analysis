ROHTAK: Blaming former chief minister   Hooda for farmers’ woes, Haryana co-operation minister  , on Sunday, alleged that it was in Hooda's ten-year regime the fertile community land was sold to builders at throw-away prices in the name of land acquisition.

 He was addressing farmers at Lahli village during the kisan card distribution event organised by The Rohtak Kendriya Sahkari Bank Limited. Reacting to Hooda’s Kisan Panchayats initiative, the Rohtak MLA alleged that the ex-CM was pretending to be a well-wisher of the farmers.
 
 "Hooda should tell people about what he has achieved for farmers during his decade-long rule. Earlier, farmers were given Re 1 or Rs 2 cheque as compensation for their crop losses,” he alleged. Grover claimed that the current state government has paid Rs 12,000 per acre to farmers as crop-loss compensation.
 
 On the controversies regarding Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, he said the benefits of the scheme have been enjoyed by farmers and the opposition parties were resorting to negative propaganda unnecessarily.
 
 Talking to TOI, Manjeet Dhankhar from Karontha village, who covered his crop by paying Rs 4000 under PMFBY for eight acres, said that he had suffered losses three months ago and he was today given Rs 1 lakh as compensation by the minister at Lahli village.   of the same village also confirmed receipt of Rs 64,000.
