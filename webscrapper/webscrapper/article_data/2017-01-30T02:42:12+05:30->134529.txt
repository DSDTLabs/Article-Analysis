NEW DELHI/BIJNOR: BJP has moved quickly to contain a possible adverse fallout of the   stir on its prospects in west UP with Haryana CM   speaking to leaders of the community and urging patience. 

 BJP members were alerted to a likely move to spread disaffection among Jats after violence near Hisar on Friday resulted in one death in police firing and the shutting down of a large section of the Chandigarh-Delhi highway. The party suspects the violence to be the handiwork of elements attempting to create resentment among west UP Jats over the treatment of Haryana protesters. 
 
 Jat organisations have now decided that urban centres like Gurgaon will not be in the ambit of the agitation. The state government has imposed restrictions and deployed forces.
 
 As UP goes to polls and the   begins afresh in neighbouring Haryana, a video of people from 35 communities apparently pledging to boycott the Jat community has gone viral on social media. The video, in which people pledge that they will not trade with Jats or even socialise with them, has raised temperatures in the region which has a significant Jat presence. The reason for the boycott is not mentioned in the video. 
 
 Police are investigating the video and believe it is an attempt to polarise the electorate just before the polls. Police officials said the video is being considered as a very serious matter and that FIRs would be filed against anybody who is found circulating it online. Investigators are trying to trace its origin. The clip surfaced a few days ago and went viral on social media.
