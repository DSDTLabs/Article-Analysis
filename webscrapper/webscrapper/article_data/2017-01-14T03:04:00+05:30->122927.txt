NEW DELHI: A special court pulled up the   for not filing the final report in a proper format in a   case involving industrialist and politician   and others. The report detailed the further probe into the disclosures made by an accused-turned-approver.

 The investigation report was filed by CBI’s Investigation Officer (IO) before special CBI judge   on the basis of the statement given by chartered accountant and New Delhi Exim Pvt Ltd Director Suresh Singhal who has turned approver in the case.
 
 The court, however, took objection to the agency for not filing the report in a proper format and posted the matter on January 23.
 
 “However, the IO has been asked to submit the report of further investigation in the proper format as per the provisions of law. Since IO has submitted that the further investigation in the matter is complete, so in view of the fact that already sufficient time in the present matter has lapsed pursuant to the directions of this court to direct further investigation, the present report is being taken on record with the direction that report in the proper format shall be submitted by January 23, 2017,” said Judge Parashar.
 
 The report cites opinion of experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) and statements of about 50 prosecution witnesses including Singhal.
 
 Singhal was one of the 15 accused in the coal scam. On July 11, 2016, the court had accepted his plea to turn approver in the case and granted him conditional pardon.
