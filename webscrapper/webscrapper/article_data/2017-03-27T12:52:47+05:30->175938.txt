JODHPUR: A woman was allegedly set ablaze by villagers including the sarpanch when she was objecting to the widening of the road near her agricultural field on Saturday in   near Jodhpur. 

 She succumbed to burn injuries at the hospital on Sunday, after which a complaint was given to the police by her brother against the sarpanch of the village and 9 others.
 
 ASP (Jodhpur Rural)   said that it has not yet been proven that she was set ablaze and we are investigating the matter with regard to the allegations made against 10 persons.
 
 Rathore said that Lalita (27) lived on her agricultural farm in   in Borunda near Jodhpur with her family.
 
 “On Saturday, work for widening the roads in her area was taking place in presence of the tehsildar, patwari, sarpanch and villagers”, said Rathore.
 
 One road was adjacent to her field and her brother Vidhyadhar himself chose to operate the JCB machine to widen that particular road so that no damage was done.
 
 “Suddenly, Lalita appeared with a can of kerosene in her hand, spread it on herself and set herself ablaze. Her brother himself and one Sharavan Singh, a villager, rushed to her rescue and took her to the hospital immediately after dousing the fire”, Rathore said adding that this all happened in full view of all the villagers and the officials.
 
 On Sunday, she was referred to the government hospital in Jodhpur, where she succumbed to her burn injuries, after which her brother Vidhyadhar gave complaint to the police alleging that sarpanch and 9 other persons set her ablaze while she was objecting to the widening of the road.
 
 “Considering the sensitivity of the matter, we have registered the complaint and have initiated an investigation”, said Rathore adding that prime facie, the allegations have not been substantiated.
