 is finally gearing up to start his first film, three years after his debut in Salman Khan’s production 'Hero'. This time, it will be in a film that will be creatively anchored by Remo D’Souza. While the actor has been almost regular with his attendance at his court hearings in the   abetment to suicide case, he has also begun to prep for the dance-driven film. While the next hearing in the case is scheduled for April 20, and more witnesses are expected to record their statements in court, the actor had begun to undergo dance rehearsals. 

 Unfortunately, the rehearsals have been halted for a few days, as Sooraj injured his leg while dancing during one of these sessions. He has now been advised to go off physical activity, including dance and workouts, and stay indoors. The film will be on floors from July and the actor is expected to resume rehearsals in a few days.
