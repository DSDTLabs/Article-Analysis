Kolkata: The state government has allotted 5.91 acre in New Town to the   for setting up various establishments.

 According to sources, Action Area I will get a second police station on an 1-acre plot (CF-25). A 3-acre plot (IIIA/2369) has been allotted in Action area III for setting up a police parade ground. Another 1-acre plot, again in Action Area III, has been earmarked (IIIA/2368) for police lines.
 
 Besides, two small plots — 0.41 acre and 0.50 acre — have been allotted for a traffic guard and a police outpost, respectively, at Eco Park.
 
 Bidhannagar City Police has already started the process of bifurcating and trifurcating at least six police stations. According to sources, syndicate war-torn New Town, Rajarhat and Baguiati will be divided into seven different police station areas instead of the current three. A barrack is esential to house extra men, given that the police here now man a significant section of trouble-prone areas like Kamduni and rural Rajarhat. The commute for cops, at present, is often back-breaking.
