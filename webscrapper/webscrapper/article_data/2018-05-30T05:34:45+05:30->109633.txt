MOHALI: High drama was witnessed outside Mataur police station, Phase VII, on Tuesday, when around eight to nine eunuchs undressed and blocked the main road for over 40 minutes. 

 Three eunuchs, almost naked, allegedly sat on rooftops and bonnets of vehicles passing by. Passers-by were left helpless as the eunuchs damaged bonnets, rooftops and windshields of around eight vehicles. 
 
 They were protesting against the incident in which "eunuchs looted people on the airport road" a few days ago, a video of which had gone viral, claiming those people were not from their community. One of the eunuchs said, "Those who looted people on the airport road a few days ago were not eunuchs. They were women and misused the name of our community. We never loot people. We demand police register a case against them."
 
 The police were seen standing as mute spectators till they got orders to pacify the eunuchs. Deputy superintendent of police (DSP)   along with Mataur SHO sub-inspector Rajiv Kumar and women police were seen trying to pacify the protesters. The eunuchs were later taken to the Mataur police station.
 
 Vijay said, "They claimed their community had been maligned. We are yet to ascertain the law under which they can be booked for obscenity."
