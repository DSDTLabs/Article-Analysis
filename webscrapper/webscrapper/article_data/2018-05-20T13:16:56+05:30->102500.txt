HYDERABAD: The chief ministers of two Telugu states,   of Telangana and N   of Andhra Pradesh, are among the regional parties’ leaders who have been invited by JD(S) leader HD   for his swearingin as the next chief minister of Karnataka on May 23. This also virtually takes forward by a leap a strong alternative for the BJP to take shape for the 2019 elections.

 
 Kumaraswamy announced, while speaking to the media in Bengaluru after meeting Karnataka governor   on Saturday, that he invited several leaders from other states for his swearing-in ceremony.
 
 West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee confirmed that she had been invited. “I spoke to Kumaraswamy ji and congratulated him. He invited me for the oath taking ceremony on Monday,” she said on Twitter.
 
 Though KCR has been invited, it could not be ascertained if he would be attending the swearing-in. Sources said KCR could be inclined to attend as he had been optimistic and declared openly during his visit to Bengaluru that Kumaraswamy would most certainly become the chief minister of Karnataka.
 
 It is important to note that   and JD(S) chose Hyderabad to keep their ‘flock’ safe from being poached by the Yeddyurappa government which had to quit on Saturday due to lack of support.
 
 KCR had said this in the context of his attempts to bring together various regional parties with a single development agenda to take the country forward. On April 13, he had gone to meet former PM Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy in Bengaluru with that idea.
 
 Former CM of UP and SP leader Akhilesh Yadav, whom KCR met in Hyderabad, has also been invited. BSP leader and ex-UP CM   was also invited.
