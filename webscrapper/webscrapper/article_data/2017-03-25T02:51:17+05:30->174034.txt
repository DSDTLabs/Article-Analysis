GURUGRAM: The city’s pollution level has been hovering in the ‘poor’ zone for the past two days.

 Rising temperatures and   storms in neighbouring Rajasthan pushed the air quality index ( ) to 295 on Thursday, before it recorded a slight dip to 235 on Friday, though still in the poor zone. 
 
 Similarly, the concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 shot up by around 36% since last week. Available data suggests the highest level of   was 135.48µg/m3 on Friday and 163.45µg/m3 on Thursday, much higher than the 60µg/m3 mark, which is the national safe standard. 
 
 The PM2.5 concentration remained comparatively on the lower side — at 105.26µg/m3 and 104.17µg/m3 on Thursday and Friday, respectively.
 
 Officials at the meteorological department and Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) blamed dust storms in Rajasthan, triggered by north-westerly winds for the rise in the city’s air pollution level. 
 
 “North-westerly winds are stirring up dust storms across Rajasthan and west Haryana, resulting in rise in pollution levels. The winds bring particulate matters from far-flung areas to the city,” said a met official.
 
 An HSPCB official agreed. “A rise in air pollution is witnessed every year before the summer, when Rajasthan experiences dust storms. Also, due to rising temperatures, wind speed increases, leading to air pollution. However, pollution levels are expected to come down gradually due to active wind pattern,” he added.
 
 Green activists, however, held ongoing construction along the national highways responsible for the rise in pollution. 
 
 “Construction work is going on across the city, but no guideline is being followed. Thousands of trees have been felled across the city,” said Vivek Kamboj of environmental NGO Haryali.
