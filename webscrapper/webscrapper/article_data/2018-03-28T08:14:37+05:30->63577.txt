LUCKNOW:  's ideological fountain head, the RSS, is initiating a new cow protection narrative by calling upon its functionaries to organize a 16-day religious programme in the name of cows in various temples across the country. 

 Shankar Lal, chief of Akhil Bharatiya Gau Sewa, an RSS wing, has issued instructions to Sangh workers through a video saying that the event from March 31 till April 15 will be a 'Mahayagya' in which people would chant a special 'Gau Mantra' in Sanskrit - ' Gau Jan Rashtra Jagat Hitayche" - so that the 'bhaav' (feeling) for cow protection is instilled in them. 
 
 At the event, RSS functionaries will also organise exhibitions where information about cow protection would be disseminated, said Lal.
 
 An RSS funtionary in Lucknow, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI that a similar exercise would be organised in 'gaushalas' (cow sheds) and other 'pavitra' (pious) places where people will take a pledge to protect cows. "This is like the programme of chanting ' mantras' during the Ram temple movement," he said, drawing parallel to the programme organised by   in 2002 when members of right wing organisations were asked to mobilize people to chant mantras. 
 
 Sangh's renewed vigour vis-a-vis cow protection, comes months after several incidents of mob lynching and murder of people by self-styled cow vigilante groups over rumours of cow slaughter, became a critical point of political stand-off between ruling BJP and opposition. The attacks left BJP and RSS on a back foot with PM   calling cow vigilantes as anti-social elements taking law in their hands. RSS chief   had urged that while protecting cows nothing should be done that hurts the belief of some people.
 
 Nevertheless, after storming to power in Uttar Pradesh last year, BJP government announced setting up of ' Gau Shalas' in all districts of the state.
