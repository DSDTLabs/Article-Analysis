Chikkaballapura: A 30-year-old woman, who was allegedly frustrated over not having a male child, killed her three girlchildren and committed suicide at Jodi Hanumanthapura village, Gudibanda taluk, in Chikkaballapura district on Thursday. 

 Police said Nagashree pushed Navyashree, 6, and Divyashree, 3, into an open well on the outskirts of the village and then jumped with her two-month-old baby at 4pm. Villagersâ€™ efforts to rescue them from the 30-foot-deep well went in vain. 
 
 Nagashree and Gangaraju of Jodi Hanumanthapura village, who works as a stone cutter, were married for seven years. 
 
 A neighbour said Nagashree was keen on having a male child and she was upset when she delivered a girl for the third time. 
 
 A T Krishnan, a relative of Gangaraju, said Nagashree was advised to provide her children with good education and informed about various government facilities available for girl children but still she was unhappy.
