Panaji: In its effort to keep coalition partners happy, BJP has decided to nominate Calangute MLA Michael Lobo for the post of deputy speaker. There was strong demand to induct Lobo in the cabinet. His workers and supporters had approached chief minister Manohar Parrikar demanding that the MLA be rewarded for his role in getting Goa Forward leaders to join the coalition. They also told Parriakr that BJP won the Calangute seat only because of Lobo. Parrikar told his close supporters that it was difficult to give him a berth in view of the political compulsions. Initially, Bicholim MLA Rajesh Patnekar who defeated Naresh Sawal (MGP) was tipped for the deputy speakerâ€™s post. Considering the undercurrent of dissatisfaction among the re-elected MLAs, the BJP core group has decided to nominate Lobo for the post. More than a year ago amid speculations that Congress had been wooing Lobo, the Calangute MLA was assured of cabinet berth, a source said. Lobo, party sources said, will file his nomination papers for the post of deputy speaker on Thursday. Congress had not finalized its candidate till Wednesday evening. From the moment Parrikar formed the government, there has been lobbying for berths which is probably whu, observers say, he inducted only nine ministers on March 14.  It is not known what position Patnekar will be given. He has made a comeback to the assembly after five years.
