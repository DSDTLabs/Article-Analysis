PANAJI: In the future, when one party manages to garner majority support and is able to form government, legislators should ensure they accept this democratic set-up and not fuel further debate on it, law and judiciary minister and senior   leader Francis D’Souza said on Tuesday during the 55th Goa Legislators Day celebrations at the Goa secretariat. D’Souza said that henceforth, laws should not be formed in a hurry, which could later lead to public outrage with demands for an amendment like seen in the Tree Act or the Mundkar Act.

 “Winning by a majority is the basic principal of democracy. We should learn to accept that. Once a government gathers majority and is formed, it is done,” D’Souza told the audience, which included senior   leaders like Shantaram Naik, Digambar Kamat and  , all of whom have repeatedly stated in the recent past that the current BJP government did not have the ‘people’s mandate’.
 
 D’Souza said legislators should work together to protect ‘goenkarponn’ and try and stay unanimous on majority of the issues to be able to work for Goa’s welfare.
 
 Any new legislation should not be passed until it has been sufficiently debated and discussed by the people and all have reached a unanimous decision, he added.
 
 “We pass laws in a hurry. We frame them in the morning and want to pass them in the evening. That is why they frequently require changes. Most recently, the Tree Act and Mundakar Act had to be amended. In a democracy, it is important to discuss and debate. Good suggestions can come from anyone and not just a few of us, who consider ourselves knowledgeable. That is why old laws seldom require changes. Because they are well thought over. Look at the Uniform Civil Code. Today the entire country wants to bring in this legislation. If we don’t listen to the people, it will be a dictatorial rule,” D’Souza said.
