MUMBAI: The  's probe into   illegally accessing call detail records (CDRs) of businessmen has suffered a setback as the main suspect claims to have disposed of his laptop and mobile phones, which could have provided investigators with details about the racket.

 The main suspect, Saurabh Sahu, was arrested from Delhi last week. Sources said he snooped on several businessmen at the behest of their rivals. Sahu told investigators that when he heard about raids on detective agencies in Mumbai, he immediately deleted the data from his laptop and broke his mobile phones and SIM cards and threw them in Ganga river.
 
 “Shahu's laptop and mobile phones would have provided us names of his clients as well as private detective agencies involved in snooping. But he claims that he threw mobiles and SIM card in Ganga river. So, we have invoked   section 201 (destruction of evidence) against him,“ said an official. Sahu has already been booked under IPC section 420 (cheating) and the Indian Telegraphic Act.
 
 Last month, the crime branch unit 9 had busted an   with the arrest of private detectives, Laxman Thakur, Kirtest Kavi and Satish Manjrekar. Manjrekar spilled the beans on Shahu's two aides, Fazal Ul Rahman alias Pappubhai and Siraj Khan, from Mumbra. Police said they were intermediaries for the detectives in Mumbai and Shahu in Delhi. Shahu, in turn, would procure CDR of businessmen with the help of service providers, sources said.
