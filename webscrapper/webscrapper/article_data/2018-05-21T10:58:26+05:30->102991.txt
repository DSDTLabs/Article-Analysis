CHANDIGARH:   MP and senior Congress leader   said on Sunday that the Karnataka episode was the start of reverse counting of the BJP-led government at the Centre as well as in Haryana.

 Addressing a rally in Bhawani Kherha area of Bhiwani district, Deepinder categorically accused chief minister Manohar Lal   and his cabinet and party colleagues of betraying the state, especially southern Haryana. Hooda said that instead of putting state on the path of development, the govt had pushed Haryana 15 years back from where the Congress took over from the INLD-BJP regime. 
 
 “Restoring communal harmony and brotherhood among residents of Haryana tops priority of the Congress. This comes with our commitment of putting the state on the path to development,” said Deepinder. Accusing Khattar of having taken anti-farmer decisions, the Rohtak MP minced no words in elaborating upon the notices served upon farmers for the attachment of their farms and forcing farmers to sell their produce at throwaway prices.
 
 “Karnataka was the turning point when the   had started seeing the downward trend. This impact will be visible during Panipat programme of Haryana Congress when former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda will resume his second leg of campaign,” he further said.
 
 “Haryana was number 1 at the time when the BJP took over the state. Now, we are number 1 in crime, especially against women. Now, in a bid to cover up their failure of honouring 154 commitments made during the assembly polls, the BJP and its leaders have started making misleading statements,’’ he claimed.
