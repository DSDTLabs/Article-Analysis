As quirky as Manju Warrier’s role in the film   was, it’s songs are quite entertaining as well. The song Chakkikochamme from the film was recently out, and it is a peep into the world of Saira Banu and Joshua Peter. The song features both of them and focuses on the rapport they share. 

 The song sung by Yazin Nizar, Sithara Krishnakumar and Joslee Jld, has been penned by Harinarayan B K and Joslee Jld. The music has been composed by Mejo Joseph. 
 Sithara Krishnakumar recently posted on her social networking page, “ Hurrayhoy !!! Happy to have done a playback track for none other that the lady superstar Manju Warrier !!! Thanks to my dear brother Mejjo Josseph !! (sic).”
