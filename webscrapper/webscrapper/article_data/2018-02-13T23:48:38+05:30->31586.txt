MUMBAI:   has decided neither to   nor favour Valentine’s Day celebrations.

 On Sunday, Lalit Mohan Sharma of Muzaffarnagar, who claimed to be Sena’s deputy head of Uttar Pradesh, had announced that party men would go out on the streets on February 14 to stop such “celebrations” in public places. Sena members in Muzaffarnagar’s Prakash Chowk even conducted a ‘lathi puja’ and declared that the sticks would come in handy to “teach a lesson” to couples indulging in public display of affection.
 
 But the Shiv Sena, on Monday, clarified that it is not against Valentine’s Day. Sena office-bearer Harshal Pradhan told TOI that Sharma had been expelled from the party two years ago. “Whatever he announced as the party stand is not the Sena’s official stand,” said Pradhan, who is close to party president Uddhav Thackeray. “Sena will neither oppose nor favour Valentine’s Day celebrations.”
