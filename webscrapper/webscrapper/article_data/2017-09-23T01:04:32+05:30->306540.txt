NEW DELHI: Six instances of spurious   being detected at the   airport in just two days have put police and   agencies in a fix with a false alarm generated each time these power-banks pass through the X-ray baggage inspection system (XBIS) machine.

 While five such instances were reported on Thursday, one incident was reported on Friday morning with power banks “covered” in   generating a false alarm, leading to the bomb squad and dog squads being called to the spot.
 
 On Friday, another such alarm was raised which sent security agencies into a tizzy early in the morning. Officials said that around 7.50am on Friday a DIAL security official detected a suspicious image of a power bank, while scanning the baggage of a passenger, Sheikh Firoz, who was travelling from Delhi to Pune via GoAir.
 
 CISF officials said the bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS) and the dog squad were called in, which declared the baggage safe after explosive vapour detectors (EVDs) detected nothing strange inside. 
 
 The passenger was later offloaded and taken to IGI police station, officials said. Police said in this case also, the power bank was found to be found to be having clay which may have been generating these alarms.
 
 “These were low quality spurious power banks which were all probably manufactured the same way. They had a clay component added to them to add weight as they had no battery inside and preliminary investigation revealed that this clay generated the false alarms,” said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (IGI).
 
 Police officers also said that they are probing where these power banks are coming from. “We have received six such cases in the last 48 hours. We are looking at all possible angles to ascertain more about the manufacturers,” said Bhatia.
