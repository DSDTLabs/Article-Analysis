BENGALURU: The Bengaluru-Hassan superfast train, which was flagged off by railway minister Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu at   on Sunday, has been named  .

 Prabhu chose the name after former prime minister   suggested that since it passes through Shravanabelagoala, the Jain pilgrimage centre known for its monolith statue of Gomateshwara, on the 167-km Bengaluru-Hassan stretch, it should be named either   Express or Hemavathi Express. Hemavathi is the prominent river in Hassan district.
 
 Chief minister Siddaramaiah, Union minister H N Ananth Kumar, industries minister R V Deshpande, and former chief minister and Congress MP M Veerappa Moily attended the function. “I thank the Centre for fulfilling the long-cherished dream of the people of this region to have the rail link. After hitting many roadblocks, the project has seen the light of the day,” said Gowda, during whose tenure the project was sanctioned in 1996. 
 
 Among the other demands Gowda, who represents Hassan constituency in the Lok Sabha, put forth before the railway minister were new direct Mysuru-New Delhi train, Mysuru-Mumbai train, Karwar-Hubli line, and Kadur-Chikkamagaluru line. He also demanded electrification of Bengaluru-Hubli-Kalaburagi line and naming the Bengaluru-Arsikere train after Kala Byraveshwara. Ananth Kumar urged the railway minister to expedite the process of sanctioning suburban train service for Benagluru city and a direct rail line linking Bengaluru and Mangaluru. 
 
 The regular train service of Gomateshwara Express will commence on Monday and two trains of 14 bogies each will ply daily stopping at Chennarayapatna, Shravanabelagola, B G Nagar, Yediyur, Kunigal, Nelamangala and Chikkbanavara.
 
 The Hassan-Yeshwantpur Intercity Express (22680) will leave at 6.30 am. and reach Yeshwantpur at 9.15am. In the return direction, the Yeshwantpur-Hassan Intercity Express (22679) will leave at 6.15pm. and reach Hassan at 9pm.
