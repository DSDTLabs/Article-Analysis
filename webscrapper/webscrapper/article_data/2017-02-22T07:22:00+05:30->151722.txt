YAMUNANAGAR: Indian National Lok Dal ( ) leader   lost his cool during a press conference in Yamunanagar on Tuesday. He was in the town to garner local support for digging of the Satluj-Yamuna Link (SYL) canal in Punjab on Thursday.

 Chautala got upset when he was asked if his call to start digging the canal could create chaos in Punjab and Haryana. He snapped at newspersons immediately. “If the questions are not relevant and carry no weight, then silence is better. I am open to any question, but can’t answer to questions that have no substance,” he said.
 
 When asked about Haryana minister Anil Vij’s advise to INLD not to make the occasion a photo opportunity, Chautala replied that he did not pay heed to those who kept making statements just to grab attention. He claimed that hundreds of vehicles from Yamunanagar would join them in Punjab.
