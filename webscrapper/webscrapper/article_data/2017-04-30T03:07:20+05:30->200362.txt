GURUGRAM:  , who have been eagerly waiting for Haryana’s RERA, are highly disappointed with the draft rules. Calling the draft a “diluted version of the central   Act”, buyers say it leaves a window for many existing projects to escape.

 According to buyers, the main point of disappointment is that the draft rules have kept most ongoing projects outside the purview of the proposed act. “Most of the projects in the city have obtained an occupation certificate (OC) without the availability of essential services such as water, sewage and power supply. If the projects with occupation certificate are kept out of the ambit of Rera, it will be totally against the interests of the buyers,” said Yashesh Yadav, an architect living in Mahindra Aura.
 
 The draft says that any project which has applied for a occupation or partial completion certificate is also not covered under RERA if the same is provided by the competent authority within three months of the application.
 
 “The state government has given the builders easy options to escape Rera in its draft rules. Developers are rushing for occupancy certificates in Gurgaon and there have been so many cases where partial OC has been granted without complete amenities,” said Gaurav Prakash, who stays in Sector 110.
 
 Residents said despite multiple representations to the state government through mails, tweets and letters, the government has disappointed the buyers. “It’s unfortunate that the state government first delayed and then diluted the central Rera Act which was to work in the interest of the buyers. However, we are still at the receiving end and the builders are enjoying,” said Prakhar Sahay, who has brought a property in Sector 82.
 
 Some residents also took to social media to slam the government. “Hon’ble CM Haryana, please take a cue from the UP chief minister and don’t allow any dilution in Rera implementation in Haryana,” read one of the tweets by Col Subhash Bhola.
