MUMBAI: In the first round of lottery for the seats reserved under the  , 2009, only 40% of the applicants were allotted a place in the city’s unaided non-minority schools. The BMC held the   on Monday through which it allotted seats for 3,720 students.

 According to BMC education inspector, Nisar Khan a total of 9,426 applications were received for 7,449 seats. However, there were 764 seats across 39 schools which received no applications. “Since there were seats which had no demand, only 6,685 seats have been allotted students. Some students have been given more than one seat and they have to pick one,” he said. Parents will have until March 15 to secure admission at the school allotted to them. In case of multiple allotments, the parents will have to approach the school of their choice.
 
 For the first time this year, the number of applications had exceeded the number of seats available. “In spite of the demand being high, there were a high number of schools where no one applied for admission. Due to this, the rush at some schools is higher. Once the first round of admissions are over, the seats which are not taken will be given to the next lot of applicants,” said Khan. Parents will have to download the allotment letters from the RTE portal and take the documents to the school for admission. Those who do not secure admission will not get another chance in the following rounds.
 
 Some parents were worried that they did not receive the messages informing them about the admissions. “We did not get a message either about allotment or not being allotted a seat. We do not have access to internet so can’t check the website on our own,” said a parent who has applied to Pawar Public School in Chandivli.
