Vadodara: A day after M S University campus witnessed a clash between the   (ABVP) and   (NSUI) rebels clashed, student groups were stopped from even making representations before MSU officials at the university head office.

 On Tuesday, supporters of both ABVP and the ‘Jai Ho’ group formed by NSUI rebels had reached the university head office to make representations against each other before the university officials.
 
 While ABVP supporters were sitting on a ‘dharna’, MSU Students Union (MSUSU) general secretary (GS)   and MSUSU vice-president (VP) Priyanka Patel were making representation before MSU’s officer on special duty (registrar) Neerja Jaiswal and in-charge vice-chancellor professor Magan Parmar.
 
 But both the university’s vigilance staff and police officials which had reached there in large numbers, started detaining the student leaders and asked them to show their identity cards.
 
 The student leaders which included girls belonging to the ‘Jai Ho’ group also entered into heated arguments with the vigilance staff and the cops who were forcibly vacating the head office premises.
 
 Even as both Batra and Patel urged the cops to let them continue their peaceful representation before the university officials, they were stopped. A total of 12 student leaders including six each from both the groups were detained by the cops.
 
 “There was no reason for police to detain us. We are not only elected representatives of students but also senate members of the university. If girl students are harassed at the campus naturally we will make representation before the university officials,” said Patel.
 
 Assistant commissioner of police (A division) J M Chavda even raised a baton against Patel.
