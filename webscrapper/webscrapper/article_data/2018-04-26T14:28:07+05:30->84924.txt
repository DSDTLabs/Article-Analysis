NEW DELHI: The Board for Cricket Control in India (BCCI) on Thursday recommended Indian skipper  's name for country's highest sporting honour Rajiv Gandhi   award. The development was confirmed by the BCCI. 

 
 
 Meanwhile, Rahul 
 's name was recommended for the prestigious Dronacharya award following the amazing success he's had with the India A and Under 19 side - that won the World Cup in New Zealand.
 
 Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar's name has been recommended for Dhyan Chand Award, which is India's highest award for lifetime achievement in sports and games. On Wednesday, the BCCI had recommended Indian cricketers Smriti Mandhana and Shikhar Dhawan for the Arjuna Award, in recognition of the exuberant performances.
 
 
 
 This is the second time Virat Kohli's name has been recommended for the Khel Ratna award by the country's cricket board. In 2016, the BCCI had recommended Kohli's name for the coveted award but unfortunately he did not receive the same.
 
 If Kohli clinches the award this time, he would become the third cricketer to get the Khel Ratna after legendary cricketer   and country's most successful captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Tendulkar received the award in 1997 while Dhoni bagged the same in 2007.
 
 The prestigious award is given for the spectacular and most outstanding performance in the field of sports by a sportsperson over a period of four years.
