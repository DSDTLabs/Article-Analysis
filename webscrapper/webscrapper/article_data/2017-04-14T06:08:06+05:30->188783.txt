BENGALURU: A debt-ridden poultry farmer in Nanjappa Layout, Allalasandra near  , committed suicide on Thursday morning after feeding poisoned juice to his wife and six-year-old son.

 While his son, Gagan passed away, Roja, his wife, is currently battling for life at a hospital.
 
 A native of Tumakuru, Mithun migrated to Bengaluru around a year ago. He took a loan and opened a poultry farm and chicken shop at   in Yelahanka. However, he failed to see any profits in his business even as debts piled up. The losses also started to tell on his domestic affairs.
 
 Police said the incident came to light after a neighbour grew suspicious over the lack of activity at the house even at noon. “We were called when the neighbour found the trio lying on the ground. We opened the door by force and rushed Roja to the hospital,“ cops said.
