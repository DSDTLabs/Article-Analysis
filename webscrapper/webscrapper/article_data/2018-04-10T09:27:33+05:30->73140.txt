HYDERABAD: As many as 190 colleges may face heat from the  , Hyderabad (JNTUH) for non-payment of common   dues to the tune of Rs 50 crore.

 JNTUH had set April 4 as the deadline for all college managements seeking affiliations to clear the affiliation fee and common service fee dues. “Non-clearance of dues... may lead to stopping of   by the university,” read a circular on March 21. The deadline has gone by, but not many colleges have made the payment, said officials.
 
 
 College managements have criticized the new affiliation regulations and termed the ultimatum ‘unfair’. “We have not received ?2,000 crore towards fee reimbursement dues from the Telangana government. Until the government releases fee reimbursement to us, we won’t be able to clear the pending amount towards common service fee,” said  , president of  .
 
 So far, no college has received reimbursement for 2017-18 while some are still awaiting the amount for 2014-15. Since colleges are neither receiving the money from the government nor charging it from students, the dues are growing.
 
 The common service fee is collected during admission for stationery, hall tickets and other facilities to students. It is ?4,500 for first year students, of which ?2,500 is paid to university and ?2,000 retained by the college. The service fee from second year onwards is ?2,500.
