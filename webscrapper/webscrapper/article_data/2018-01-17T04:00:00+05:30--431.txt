Surat: Two step brothers were arrested from a locality under the limits of Umra police station on Tuesday for allegedly stealing Rs12 lakh cash and gift vouchers from a retail shopping mall at Parle Point. 

 Police recovered Rs11 lakh cash from Ashiq alias Ashish Salim Gamit (21), and Suresh alias Suraj Dinesh Gamit (25), who had stolen the cash from Dhiraj Sons on Monday. 
 
 The employees realized that the cash was missing from the store soon after arriving for work. Hemant Bhandari, an employee of the store, lodged a police complaint about the theft. 
 
 Police examined CCTV footages and found involvement of the duo in the theft and arrested them before they could leave the city.
 
 Mother of both the accused is same but they have different fathers. Suresh is elder brother of Ashiq. The woman separated from his father and married another man whose son is Ashiq. The brothers, natives of Songadh in Tapi district, are currently staying in the city.
 
 Ashiq was earlier employed at the shopping mall but had left the job a few months ago. Suresh, who is employed, had planned the theft. According to their plan, Ashiq entered the store at its closing time and hid himself. Once the store was locked, he came out and stole the cash and vouchers from the drawer. He was aware about a door at the store’s back side from where he came out as it was not locked properly.
 
 “The accused are born of a same mother but different fathers. Ashiq had worked in the store in the past and was aware about its design. Cash collection of three days was in the store and it was to be deposited at a bank on Monday,” said Umra police inspector D J Kubawat.
