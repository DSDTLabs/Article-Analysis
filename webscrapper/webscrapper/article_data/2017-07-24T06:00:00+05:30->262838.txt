The tremor in his hands, caused by Parkinson’s disease, was hard to miss as   took to the stage at   on Saturday night. But neither his advancing years nor the strains of the degenerative disorder had any affect on the notes flowing out of his flute as the Padma Vibhushan awardee gave Hyderabadis a rare glimpse into his prowess. 
Bringing down the curtains on the  , the wizard transported the audience to a meditative world of tranquillity with the dhun of his bansuri that lingered even after he had stopped playing.
 Opening with Madhuvanti, a melodic early evening raag of Todi thaat, he played a soulful aalap, traversing through the lower octave with ease, as he explored the myriad colours and moods of the romantic raga. His senior disciple,  , followed him with remarkable sensitivity. The detailed aalap-jod-jhala unfolded the beauty of the raag. Two virtuoso artists of percussion,   and   provided pakhawaj and tabla accompaniment with admirable restraint, without drowning the melody of the flute in the rhythmic beats of the percussion.
 Next up was the night raag, Bihag. The maestro created a somber dhun on his bansuri with delicate touches on both the madhyams, escalating its magnificence. The lilting dhun and beats of Pahadi that followed was an 
 exquisite contrast after the romance and solemnness of Madhuvanti and Bihag. The magic of his phoonk put the audience in a trance as the mystery and charm of the hills came alive in the auditorium. Both the percussionists followed panditji with apparent ease, drumming in cohesion.
 The maestros intended to close the concert with the dhun of Pahadi, but the audience was not ready to let him go. “Bageshree”, one shouted from the audience, while another requested ‘Malhar’. Panditji smiled and said, “Usmein toh aur ek ghanta lag jata. Chalo ek bhajan suna dete hai.” Thus, the concert drew a close with a soul-stirring rendition the iconic Vaishnava Jana To.
