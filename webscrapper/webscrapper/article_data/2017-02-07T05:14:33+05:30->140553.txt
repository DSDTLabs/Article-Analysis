NAVI MUMBAI: Environmentalist Sumaira Abdulali of the   has reported to the state authorities about illegal   district and also submitted incriminating photos. 

 "During recent field visits to Mahad and Dharamtar creek, near Alibaug, I noticed heavy duty suction pumps were brazenly used for illegal sand mining. At Kihim beach, there was similar evidence about sand mining, which is wrecking havoc on the environment. I have taken photographs and complained to state government agencies, including Konkan divisional commissionerate and Raigad district collectorate," said Abdulali.
 
 "We request strict enforcement and action against illegal sand mining using suction pumps. Such strict action is especially urgent at sites next to bridges as sand mining is likely to undermine and damage foundations of road and railway bridges and make them unsafe," Abdulali said in a formal complaint.
 
 Raigad district officials said they regularly take action against miners at various sites, including Mahad, Alibaug, Panvel and other talukas in the district, and that all public complaints are looked into.
 
 A local activist said, "There was a meeting of senior state officials on illegal sand mining recently. Konkan division is likely to come up with strict guidelines. Since there is a construction boom in parts of Raigad, especially near the proposed Navi Mumbai international airport, there has to be strong policing on transportation of illegal sand, or the mafia will continue to do business."
 
 Abdulali said even at Mahad toll bridge site, where she was assaulted in 2010, illegal activities are going on.
