NEW DELHI: Amid uncertainty if   will call for election to the   Working Committee,   on Saturday said the party has always given its president the top decision-making body of his choice.

 
 The Congress constitution mandates that 12 of the 25 members be elected at the AICC session but the provision has not been invoked for last 21 years. The comment from AICC led to further speculation if Rahul will call for elections to  , an idea that he has shared with party leaders in the past years.
 
 Congress will hold its AICC plenary session on March 16-18 in the capital, a mega congregation where the party plans to sharpen its attack on the Modi government by citing the PNB scam as symptomatic of corruption and crony capitalism.
 
 The decision to hold the plenary in the middle of the budget session of Parliament, which would resume on March 5, is designed to amplify the attack on the government.
