KANPUR: IIT-Kanpur senate, the apex decision-making body of the institute, has allowed 14 students suspended for a ragging incident to take re-admission and join from the semester starting May 14. 

 However, admission would be given on a provisional basis only. It would be later reviewed on the basis of any order of the high court where the matter is pending, a senior IIT-K administrative official told TOI on Wednesday on condition of anonymity.
 
 The alleged incident took place on August 19, 2017. Some first year students had alleged that they had been abused and asked to do some formidable tasks by some of their seniors. The matter was probed and was found to be true after which the institute administration had suspended all 22 senior students allegedly involved in the incident.
 
 While 14 of them were suspended for three years, six others were suspended for six months. "As the six-month suspension has ended, they have automatically become eligible for re-admission," said an official.
