PATNA: Five out of the six ventilators in the   paediatric department’s intensive care unit (ICU) have been out of order for the past three months. It was revealed at a meeting of the hospital’s patient welfare society (rogi kalyan samiti) chaired by its ex officio chairperson and Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor on Friday. Kishor instructed the hospital authorities to repair the ventilators immediately.

 When contacted, HoD of Paediatrics Dr Anil Kumar Jaiswal said the ventilators had been repaired several times in the past. “Three ventilators are of one company and the other three from another company. We have written several times to these two companies for repair, but they say some parts are unavailable and it will take time,” he said. The hospital administration has also written to Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Corporation Limited (BMSICL) for purchasing five new ventilators.
 
 Kishor also instructed the PMCH administration to increase the number of beds in the emergency ward from 100 to 200 within a month. He also instructed them to start the kidney transplant unit from June without any further delay. The unit was scheduled to start in December 2017. 
 
 He asked the Patna civil SDO and SDPO (sadar) to ensure removal of all private ambulances and unauthorized medicine shops from the hospital campus. Kishor asked the hospital administration to make available to the patients 55 out of the 120 free drugs that the hospital has so far been unable to provide.
 
 It was also decided at the meeting that OT assistants, dressers, x-ray technicians, dark room assistants and lab technicians would be appointed on contract. Two lab technicians, especially for the testing of dengue patients, will also be appointed on contract.
