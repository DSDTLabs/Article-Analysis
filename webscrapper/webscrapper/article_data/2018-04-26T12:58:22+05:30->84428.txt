TRICHY: Bullock carts involved in sand mining and transporting faced opposition from the local people alleging   congestion in Sarkarpalayam across Cauvery River in   on Wednesday.

 A group of people from the area intercepted the sand-laden carts this morning. They alleged that the movement of the carts on the Kallanai road for taking sand from the Sarkarpalayam depot causes traffic congestion in the morning every day. It may be pointed out that the depot was opened for the bullock carts on April 21 following the series of requests from them.
 
 The local people picked up arguments with the   owners stating that they should take another route to reach the depot to take the sand. The issue led to a traffic jam on the stretch for half an hour on Wednesday.
 
 On getting the information, the Fort police officials rushed to the spot and held talks with the locals to disperse them. However, the people stood firm on their stand. The police assured them that a new depot for the bullock carts will be opened in one more place in some other area until then the carts will be taking sand from here and persuaded them to disperse.
 
 G K Ramar, the district president of sand bullock cart workers association affiliated to   alleged about vested interests of some local people to disturb their livelihood.
 
 “Some influential local people used to commit illegal sand mining in the area. Since PWD opened a separate one for us and put an end to their activities, they were hell bent to cause disturbance to us,” he said. tnn
