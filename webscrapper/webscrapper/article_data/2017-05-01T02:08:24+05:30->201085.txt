NEW DELHI: Saturday’s crime where an undertrial was shot dead in the city’s Rohini   complex has set off alarm bells ringing in the high court.

 More so, when just a day earlier a bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Anu Malhotra had directed agencies to remove encroachments bordering the Rohini court complex as they posed a safety hazard to others.
 
 Following the murder,   has now given green signal to a comprehensive   of all court complexes in the capital.
 
 The   will be conducted by Delhi Police to ensure that such incidents don’t recur. Sources said that police is expected to start the audit exercise with Rohini court complex and apprise HC about its findings this week. The audit will study entry and exit points along with vulnerable spots in each of the six district courts and recommend ways to plug loopholes.
 
 Squatters near the court complex have been under HC’s scanner since Tuesday when it heard a PIL highlighting encroachments near the complex posing a   hazard and nuisance to public. It had then ordered a senior officer of north corporation to “personally supervise” an inspection of the area between the court complex and Rohini FSL last week.
 
 It had demanded a report why “sanctions were granted by the authorities to the construction which is complained of in this petition”, adding that “the law should be strictly complied with.”
 
 After the agency apprised it on the extent of encroachment, the court cautioned lawyers they “cannot break the law” and directed immediate removal of the structures. It also directed police, corporation and DDA to ensure free movement of emergency vehicles near court complex.
