CHENNAI: Deputy chief minister   on Friday stirred up a hornet's nest by revealing that he agreed to merge his faction with that of the   faction last August and accepted a cabinet berth only at the instance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This contradicts all claims made by himself, the   and the   over the last few months that Modi and the BJP had no role in the reunion of the two factions. 

 The timing of the revelation - coinciding with the first anniversary of the EPS government and his assertion that he would not mind getting back to his tea stall and manage its affairs - also reflects the unease between chief minister Palaniswami and his deputy.
 
 "Prime Minister Modi, during a courtesy meeting, suggested I should merge with AIADMK to save the party. I informed this to two cabinet ministers in the Palaniswami camp and they insisted that I accept a minister's post. That is why I am a minister now," OPS told his close supporters in Theni on Friday evening.
 
 "I have no desire to be a minister.   made me an MLA for four times and chief minister twice. That honour itself is enough. If anyone else had faced this amount of crisis and problems, they would have committed suicide or would have left the party. (But) I tolerated everything for the sake of Amma," OPS told his supporters.
