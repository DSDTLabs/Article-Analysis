PUNE: Beleaguered by the consecutive defeats in  , Assembly and local body elections, the Congress and the Nationalist   leaders are putting maximum efforts to galvanize support and regain their voter base as the  , a long march demanding complete waiver of agriculture loans, entered western Maharashtra on Monday. 

 The two parties launched the Yatra from   in Vidarbha last week. The Yatra will end in Sindhudurg on April 5. 
 
 " This is going to be a continuous movement till the government announces complete waiver of the loans," said state Congress president  . NCP leader Ajit Pawar said the government was anti-farmer. NCP president   on Monday announced that he would take part in the Yatra. 
 
 Interestingly, leaders of the Congress and the NCP, who have been blaming each other for poll debacle are now singing in one tune. Former chief minister and Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan and his political foe Ajit Pawar are travelling together in the Yatra.
 
 " Congress and NCP have realised that they will not be able to hold on to their space in state politics if they continue to fight with each other. The BJP has emerged stronger and the Congress and the NCP have no option but to join hands to combat the saffron wave," said an NCP leader who is part of the Yatra. 
 
 The Congress and the NCP's joint effort has riled BJP's partner, the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, which claims to represent farmers. "The Congress and the NCP have nothing to do with farmers' issues and they are playing politics. We will ensure that farmers get a loan waiver," said Sanghatana president MP Raju Shetti in Kolhapur. 
 
 The Yatra entered Solapur district on Monday and will reach Pune district on Tuesday. The BJP has ridiculed the agitation saying that the parties which were responsible for farmers' suicides in Maharashtra are busy playing politics over farmers' issues.
