KOLKATA: The opposition -   and   - disrupted assembly proceedings during question hour on Tuesday, forcing speaker Biman Bandyopadhyay to adjourn proceedings of the house in the first half. This followed an adjournment motion moved by Congress against the "deteriorating law-and-order situation in the state", which the speaker disallowed. The opposition boycotted proceedings in the second half. 

  later moved a censure motion against this "unparliamentary activity" by Congress and CPM.
 
 In the morning, leader of the opposition Abdul Mannan wanted to move an adjournment motion but that was disallowed by the speaker. "Yesterday, scribes and   supporters were beaten up by the government. We wanted to reach out to the people through the house but that was disallowed by the speaker. The voice of the opposition is being throttled and they will not allow us to speak," Mannan said.
 
 Just after this, Left and Congress members rushed to the well and started shouting slogans, waving posters and black flags. They stood in front of the speaker, who was cordoned off by security. This continued for more than an hour. Bandyopadhyay adjourned the house at 12.05pm.
 
 After the house reconvened at 1pm without the opposition, the speaker said he had been observing that some members of the house were not allowing the house to proceed normally. This was unparliamentary, he said, seeking members' cooperation. 
 
 Trinamool parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee moved a censure motion against the CPM and Congress members. The motion was passed.
 
 Congress and CPM rallied to the governor to complain that the opposition was allowing them to speak. "They have made the state a prison and using force whenever something is said against them. It's shocking that an MLA is not allowed to enter the state headquarters," said CPM leader Sujan Chakraborty.
