BENGALURU: “We are not in trading activity, hence abolish the trade license for medical establishments,” said the   (PHANA),   during the National Health summit, held here on Saturday. In their memorandum to the government, the association has sought for reconsideration of trade license, Fire safety   among other demands.

 With the government now insisting on the medical establishments have to obtain No objection certificate from the Karnataka Fire and safety services, the PHANA members said that it’s not possible to bring in changes to the old buildings of many hospitals. “Some of the hospital buildings were constructed even before the laws came into force. It is practically impossible to modify or bring in infrastructural changes to fulfill the requirements of the department,” PHANA president Dr  , told TOI. The association is asking the government to consider the healthcare establishments under micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) so that it helps the hospitals in procuring loans.
 
 “Currently we are obtaining licenses from more than 140 licenses form more than 30 government agencies to run a hospital. The government has to bring in a single window system for all approvals, clearances,” said Dr Gaekwad.
