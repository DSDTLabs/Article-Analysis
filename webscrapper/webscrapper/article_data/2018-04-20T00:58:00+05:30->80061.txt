Coimbatore: The suspended first year student of Coimbatore Government Law College, R Priya, on Thursday petitioned the college administration to change the two-member inquiry committee formed to probe the complaints against her.

 Priya, who appeared before the committee, also sought two weeks’ time to submit a written response to the panel and requested college principal to revoke her suspension until then.
 
 “I have submitted a petition to the college principal, asking him to form a fresh inquiry committee. I have also sought copies of the complaints filed by students and professor Ammu, and recommendations by justice P Shanmugam committee,” she said.
 
 When contacted, college principal K S Gopalakrishnan said Priya had asked for her suspension to be revoked as exams were nearing. “I have asked the inquiry committee for an interim report on Friday to take a call on whether to allow her to write exams or not. If the interim report is favourable, we will temporarily revoke her suspension to let her write exams, which will be held in May,” he said.
 
 Gopalakrishnan added that it would take around 25 days for the committee to submit the final report. About forming a new committee, he said he would forward it to the government.
 
 Priya was suspended on April 13 for allegedly ‘inciting gender and religious differences’ among students in the campus.
