Coimbatore: As many as 14 members of Indu Makkal Katchi were arrested on Wednesday for ransacking a new   liquor shop in Peelamedu. 

 Members of the organisation, led by Colony Prabhu, had ransacked the shop in Sihs Colony around 10am, police said. They were arrested in the afternoon and were remanded to judicial custody. The liquor shop was set up in the area about 20 days ago. Local residents said they had petitioned the city police and Tasmac authorities asking them to close the shop as it was causing trouble.
 
 Speaking to reporters, Colony Prabhu said, “There was a Tasmac shop in the area. Two more were opened recently. These shops were selling liquor at odd hours, causing trouble for the residents. Though we petitioned the officials concerned to close the shops, no action was taken, leading to our protest.”
