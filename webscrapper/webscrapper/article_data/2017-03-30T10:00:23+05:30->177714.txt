MAPUSA: Water resources minister and   MLA   said that efforts were on to improve the power situation in the constituency and also moves were afoot to clear the heaps of garbage dumped along both sides of the   road.

 Taking a stock of the power situation, Palyekar has discussed with officials of the electricity department to install sub-stations wherever required and asked them to submit estimations at the earliest. He also inaugurated high-mast lamps in the market and near the old theatre. Palyekar, who led his volunteers to clear the garbage lying immediately close to the road on Sunday, said that once a fortnight, if not every week, they would clear part of the garbage. “The garbage collected was taken to the garbage treatment plant in  ,” he said.
 
 Motorists, using the road to Siolim via   housing board, have been facing the menace as garbage continues to be dumped along the road. Dry waste is set on fire often. “The issue has been discussed with the chief minister and the mounds of garbage will be cleared,” he said.
