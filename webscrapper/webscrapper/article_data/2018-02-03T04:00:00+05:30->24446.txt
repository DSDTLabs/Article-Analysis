Surat: Customs department in Mumbai have started imposing 5 per cent import duty on cut and polished diamonds a day after Union finance minister Arun Jaitley announced revised duty in his Union Budget speech on Thursday.  Industry sources said the customs department in Mumbai seized around 100 parcels, mainly of broken and semi-processed diamonds imported from the US, from Mumbai international airport on Friday. The value of the cut and polished diamonds is worth crores of rupees and some of the importers paid the duty to get their parcels released by the department.  Jaitley announced increase in import duty on cut and polished diamonds, lab-grown diamonds and cut and polished coloured gemstone from 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent while presenting the Union Budget 2018.  Diamond trader Kirti Shah said, “Usually, implementation of the changed duty structure comes into effect only after notification has been issued. In this case, Jaitley announced the hike in import duty on cut and polished diamonds on Thursday and its implementation started by the customs department from Friday itself.” Meanwhile, Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council (GJEPC) has opposed the hike in the import duty on cut and polished diamonds by the government.  GJEPC chairman Pramod Agarwal said in a statement, “This move hampers India’s chances of becoming an international diamond trading hub. This move doesn’t provide India a level playing field vis-à-vis other peers such as Belgium, Dubai and Israel. It will also have a negative impact on Shut Out business from the US, which has been a fast growing segment.”
