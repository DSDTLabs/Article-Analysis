NAGPUR: Union women and child development minister  , chairwoman of People For Animals (PFA), has reconstituted the city unit of her NGO. A new seven-member PFA body was finalized on Sunday during the minister’s visit.

 Pramod Kanetkar, secretary of NGO Indian Society for Animal Welfare (ISAW), will be the president of PFA’s new unit. As per information available on the official website of PFA, the new unit is called ‘PFA Nagpur II’. The new body is a mix of people working in different fields — animal activists, social workers, a chartered accountant and architect.
 
 The existing unit of PFA was managed by animal activist Karishma Galani, who has been associated with the NGO for over last five years. Though it is not clear what will happen to the existing unit, Galani said it will be dissolved for now. “I, along with other members, have given our resignations and this body will likely be dissolved,” she said.
 
 The activist, however, added that she would continue to work for animal welfare. “We will form a new body but we are not sure of the name yet. We will complete the dissolution formalities and submit the papers at PFA’s head office in Delhi,” she said.
 
 On Sunday afternoon, the new members of NGO held the first official meeting with Gandhi. Sources informed that the minister urged the new body to increase public connect in the city and create sensitization about animal welfare. “The members have been asked to focus extensively on ground work. Another task for them is to increase the work force and rope in volunteers,” they said.
 
 Streamlining cases of animal cruelty and handling them as per provisions of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 is another agenda for the new team. Apart from domestic and stray animals, the unit will also work towards protection of wildlife. “We are planning to form separate teams for wild and domestic animals. We will soon organize a public meet so that more hands can join us,” Kanetkar said.
