LUCKNOW: Institutions imparting quality education can aim for the autonomous tag as the Budget promises more autonomy to colleges and universities.

 Autonomy also means mandatory accreditation and ranking, the two parameters on which UP colleges often falter. Though 11 out of 16 UP universities are eligible for accreditation by the   (NAAC), only five have the coveted accreditation. UP has 159 government colleges, of which 138 are eligible for NAAC. But only 34 colleges are accredited. Not a single government college in Lucknow has grade ‘A’ rating from NAAC. In government-aided institutions, only 131 have passed the NAAC test. Self-finance colleges, too, lag behind as only 271 out of over 4,600 colleges in the state are accredited. 
 
 Based on the credit programmes and outcome from accreditation, the government plans to come up with a revised framework for colleges. In Lucknow, government-aided colleges like   and Jai Narain Post Graduate College have been demanding autonomy for the past many years.
