Subtle signs of fatal heart attacks, such as fainting,   and   that may occur up to a month before death, are often missed by doctors in many hospitalized patients, a new UK study has found. Researchers from Imperial College London said more research is urgently needed to establish whether it is possible to predict the risk of fatal   in patients for whom this condition was not recorded as the main reason for hospital admission.

 Heart attacks are caused by a decrease in blood flow to the heart, usually as a result of coronary heart disease. Symptoms may include sudden chest pain or a 'crushing' sensation that might spread down either arm. Patients might also experience nausea or shortness of breath. However, some heart attacks have more subtle symptoms and may therefore be missed or overlooked.
 
 In the study, researchers examined records of all 446,744 NHS hospital stays in England between 2006 and 2010 that recorded heart attacks, as well as the hospitalization history of all 135,950 heart attack deaths. Of the 135,950 patients who died from heart attack, around half died without a hospital admission in the prior four weeks, and around half died within four weeks of having been in hospital. As many as 21,677 (16%) of the patients who died from heart attack had been hospitalized during the four weeks prior, but   were not mentioned on their hospital records.
