Jaipur: The victim of last year’s   lynching case, 51-year-old Pehlu Khan, has been charged along with two others for cow smuggling by the Alwar police.

 Police filed a second chargesheet in the murder case in Behror court after the Khan’s family failed to provide the transit permit required for transporting bovines from one state to another.
 
 The chargesheet has been filed under various sections of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995 at the local court on January 24.
 
 Last year on April 5, Pehlu Khan, a dairy farmer from Haryana, was brutally lynched by cow vigilantes (gau rakshaks) near Behror in Alwar. He was transporting cows to Nuh in Haryana after purchasing them from Jaipur. They were attacked near Jaguwas in Behror on National Highway 8.
 
 Khan’s family had maintained that they had valid documents to transport the cows. However, police said they did not have the required permit.
 
 “The permit is issued by the collector of the district from where the bovines are bought and required to transport cows to another state. We kept asking the family to produce the transit permit, but they never submitted it. Initially, we had registered a case under sections 5, 8, 9 of the Rajasthan Bovine Animal (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 1995 and Rules, 1995,” said a senior officer with the Alwar police.
 
 “We have maintained the same charges filed earlier in the FIR against Pehlu Khan and five others,” the officer said.
 
 After the FIR was lodged, the family had produced the purchase bill for the cows.
 
 The Meo community to which Pehlu Khan belongs had also accused the police for not arresting the culprits, and alleged that a weak chargesheet was against them. “Police are trying to prove that Pehlu Khan is a smuggler while not clarifying who killed him,” said Sher Mohammad, former ‘sadar’, Meo panchayat.
