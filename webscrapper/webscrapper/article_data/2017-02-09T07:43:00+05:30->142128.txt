Nagpur:   Synthetics (India) Limited (IRSIL), which has a plant at Butibori has ended up with one more quarter in losses. It has posted a loss of Rs 37.95 crore for the quarter ending on December 2016. 

 This is five times more than the loss incurred in same quarter last year. The company which is in losses for last two years was expecting a 10% growth but demonetization pulled down the sales, said its chairman O P Lohia. The company is dubbed to be the country’s largest polyester maker. The capacity utilization of the Nagpur plant was reduced by 10%.
 
 Sales for the quarter ending on December 31 2016 stand at Rs 623 crore as against Rs 663 core in the same period last year.   for the entire nine months of the fiscal till December 2016 is higher than the previous year by Rs 34 crore at Rs 2099.80 crore. However, net loss for the nine month period is higher at Rs 69.20 crore as compared to nine months of previous fiscal when it was at Rs 51.60 crore.
 
 Lohia told TOI that demonetization has taken a major toll on the demand. The impact could be seen till December. Rising prices of petroleum which is raw material for the industry have also hit margins.
 
 “The rising costs could not be passed on to the consumer till January-February as the demand was low before that. The note-ban had taken a toll on demand by almost 20%. This can be seen from the dip in revenues which is over Rs 40 crore,” said Lohia.
 
 He said a revival is expected from April onwards as the demand is looking up and the cost is same. The hike in petroleum costs have also been passed on to the consumers. The quarter saw a dip in company’s exports also as against a level of 2% it had dropped to 15%.
