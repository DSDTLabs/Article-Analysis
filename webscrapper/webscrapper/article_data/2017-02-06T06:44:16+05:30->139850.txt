KOZHIKODE: "There are extremists everywhere, and extremism is present in every community. But why is it that the Muslims are targeted?" When   novelist   shared her thoughts during an interaction at the Kerala Literature Festival here on Sunday, it turned out to be an outburst of an individual vexed about Islamic terrorism and Islamophobia. 

 Life has become difficult for the Muslims since the September 11 terror attack, she said.
 
 "We are sandwiched between two monsters-the   on one side and Islamophobia on the other. But why is it that we have to pay the price?" asked the writer, educationist and peace ambassador working for interfaith camaraderie.
 
 Strongly criticizing the policies of new US president  , the writer said he legalized Islamophobia and sexism. In the modern times, the social media has also helped in the propagation of the extremist ideals, according to her.
 
 The author of novels like 'The Holy Woman', 'Typhoon' and 'Revolt', said she is very interested in writing about women's issues and used her work to communicate her social message.
 
  The writer strongly opposed the ban on burkini-the swimsuit that covers the entire body but the face-in France. "Please leave Muslim women alone," said the writer who lives in Manchester.
 
 Sharing her concern about the animosity between India and Pakistan, Shahraz said, "I defy those people who divide us. I can't tolerate intolerant minds and hearts."
 
 Though she said that the women in Pakistan are not oppressed or suppressed as the world believes, Shahraz agreed that her mind 'does not belong there fully' and there was no guarantee that she would have become a writer had she lived in Pakistan. At the same time, living in the West has been very difficult for Muslim women, added Shahraz.
