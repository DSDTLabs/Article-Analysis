 Clerk Devarajan wanted the high court to take suo motu proceeding against the chief minister and his deputy and recommend the central government to dismiss Tamil Nadu government since the governor is not in station.
 
 On Tuesday morning, when the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice A Selvam commenced their proceeding, Devarajan made a mention alleging that the hunger strike staged by the chief minister and the deputy chief minister was against the provisions of the Constitution.
 
 Refusing to accept his request, the bench said it could consider taking up the issue if a proper petition was filed.
 
 To this, Devarajan said that it would cost at least Rs 1,000 to file a PIL and he could not afford it.
