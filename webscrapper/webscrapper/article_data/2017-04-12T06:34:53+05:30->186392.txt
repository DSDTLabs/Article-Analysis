LUCKNOW: Mess services of all   boys’ hostels came to a halt after resident students of Subhash hostel beat up their   on Tuesday. This was the second such incident in which hostellers complaining poor quality food roughed up mess staff.

 On Monday night, hostellers got into a verbal spat over poor quality food being served, which aggravated further on Tuesday morning when students reportedly entered into a fight with the mess in charge over the issue. In protest against the alleged misbehaviour of students, mess services of all boys’ hostel including Mahmudabad, Habibullah, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Subhash and Birbal Sahni remained suspended during lunch time.
 
 After mess services were discontinued at the hostels, hundreds of students’ gheraoed Lucknow University vice-chancellor’s residence and staged protest, demanding that they should be given permission to cook in the hostel as the mess fails to provide quality food and very often food fall shorts.
 
 The protest was called off after vice-chancellor S P Singh assured students mess services would be resumed and better facilities will be made available. The mess services of Acharya Narendra Dev hostel have remained closed for more than 15 days since the mess in charge refused to cater to students complaining misbehaviour and that outsiders were availing mess services. Mess at   hostel was also closed for a day following ruckus created by AND hostellers at lunch time. The university authorities divided AND students and accommodated them in other hostels. This was the third time mess services were disrupted.
 
 “The problem related to hostel mess will be resolved soon, once the university starts providing central mess facility,” said chief proctor Vinod Singh.
