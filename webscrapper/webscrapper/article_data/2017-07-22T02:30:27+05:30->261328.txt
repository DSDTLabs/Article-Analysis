Gurgaon: A former   has been booked for allegedly seeking Rs 10 lakh   from a city-based pub owner and threatening to   his son, the police said on Friday.

 Vinod Kumar, the owner of Queens Club Bar and Lounge in MGF Metropolitan mall on MG Road, lodged a complaint at the DLF-II police station on Thursday, alleging that he had been getting threat calls from his former employee Tejinder Adhana alias Bittu for the past one year.
 
 Bittu, a resident of Tigaon village in Faridabad, used to work in Vinod’s pub as a bouncer but was sacked one-and-a-half years ago after Faridabad police had detained him for questioning in a criminal case.
 
 Vinod told cops that even after being sacked, Bittu used to come to the club with his friends often, get drunk and abused and beat up customers, and “picked up fight with us when we interfered”. 
 
 In his complaint, the pub owner also alleged that Bittu did not pay for entry fee, and drinks and eatables consumed at the club. “Bittu and his associates used to enter our club with knives and pistols. When we banned their entry from the club, it infuriated them and their behaviour got worse,” Vinod said.
 
 According to Vinod, Bittu and his friends tried to trespass into the club on July 17 and demanded Rs 10 lakh. “They further called me on my mobile number and threatened to kill me and kidnap my son if I did not meet their demands,” he said.
 
 An FIR was registered against Bittu under sections 384 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation), 507 (criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication) of IPC at DLF-II police station. “A special team has been formed to nab the accused,” said inspector Sudip Kumar, SHO of the police station.
