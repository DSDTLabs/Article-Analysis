CHENNAI:   is all too familiar with despair. Even scoring 82% in the   examination was not enough to put a smile on the face of the 17-year-old from the fishing  .

 The reason is Ravi has no one to share the joy of his accomplishment. Until a month ago, his parents and a younger sister lived in poverty but as a family, today they are scattered and he has no information about his mother. “I have nobody to share the news of scoring 410 marks. Nobody to share the happiness with,” said Ravi, a student of the Greater Chennai Corporation-run higher secondary school on Tiruvottiyur High Road.
 
 He no one to look after him, Ravi may have to quit his studies and take up a job to survive. But even with his family around, life was never smooth for the teenager. An alcoholic father and distraught mother meant that there was never peace at home. “My father used to drink more than he used to go fishing,” he said. Quarrels were frequent and he could hardly find time to prepare for his examination. “I would wait till (my parents) finished fighting and slept. I used to study from 11pm till 1am and then early morning before I left for school,” said Ravi, a resident of the Tsunami Colony in Tondiarpet.
 
 Weeks before his results were to be announced, Ravi’s mother left the family fed up with the quarreling. “I don’t know where my mother is,” said the teenager sullenly.
 
 Ravi’s relatives have now taken in the two children. Ravi stays with his aunt at Kasimedu, while his sister lives with another aunt. “She (aunt) wants me to quit studies and work so that I can take care of my sister because my father is a drunkard. But I told to her face that I won’t give up (studies) for any reason. She was upset. But I don’t care,” Ravi said.
 
 Ravi wants to pursue BCom. He is also a footballer and idolises Barcelona and Real Madrid forwards Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. “If I can become a   one day, I will be happy,” he adds with a hint of a smile at last.
