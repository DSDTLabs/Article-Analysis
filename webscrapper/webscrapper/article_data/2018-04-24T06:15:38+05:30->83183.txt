SINGUR: There was no barricade. Nor was there a heavy police presence. The Singur BDO office on Monday witnessed a different picture. The reason isn’t hard to gauge — it’s a battle of equals in Singur.   is contesting in all the 16 gram panchayats here.

 Singur, incidentally, in the 2008 panchayat elections had embraced Trinamool — three years before the party came to power in the state. This time, BJP is contesting in 44 of the 47 gram panchayat seats in Gopalnagar, KGD and Beraberi — the three villages located in the now-deserted Tata project area. According to a source, even CPM is trailing BJP in filing nominations here.
 
 On Monday, as violence rocked the state over nominations, 65 fresh nominations were filed in the Singur BDO office. If Trianmool Congress filed 19; BJP filed
 
 18. Even CPM could file 13 nominations.   said, “The nomination process completed peacefully. 65 nominations were filed for gram panchayats and eight more panchayat samitis.”
 
 Raju Mal (45), a   villager and a former Trinamool panchayat samiti leader, has now switched flanks to lead BJP. Mal claims, “We were part of the anti-land grab movement. There is a simmering anger against the local Trinamool leadership here. The state has done enough here but the doles have only swelled pockets of their own leaders. BJP, therefore, is the only alternative.” Sanjoy Pande, BJP’s Singur unit secretary, said, “The local leaders are interested in their personal gain. People had enough of it.”
 
 “BJP is a temporary craze. They promise just about anything — the same thing Trinamool had done. We can’t ape them. We will keep working with the people,” said  , CPM Hooghly secretary.
 
 Trinamool’s Singur legislator  , who is locked in a power struggle with the party’s Singur block president  , said, “Let us contest democratically.”
