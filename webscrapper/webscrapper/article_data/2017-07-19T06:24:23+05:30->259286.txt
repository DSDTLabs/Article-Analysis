LUCKNOW:   ( )   in Lucknow who have been asked by the   to wind up their projects and shift to centres like Noida, Indore and Pune by December-end staged a   for the second time in seven days in front of their office premises in Vibhuti Khand on Tuesday. Around 250 employees, including engineers, administration staff and associates, gathered at about 3 pm and displayed banners and posters saying ‘Save TCS Lucknow’, ‘Home or Job?’ etc. 

 They had also met chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi on July 15 to apprise him with their situation and requested him to help. The CM had assured he would talk to senior management and stop their transfers. However, the employees alleged that the company was giving false feedback that they would shift only a few people when actually they had all been asked to move. 
 
 An employee said, “Earlier, they said they couldn’t afford the high rental of lease agreement. Then they said they want to consolidate UP operations at one centre and now they say Lucknow centre is not giving enough profits. This is presenting wrong picture before the government which wants to help us. We want to request the government to help us as have our families here.”
 
 The employees also staged a candle march from their office to PICUP Bhawan on Tuesday evening.
