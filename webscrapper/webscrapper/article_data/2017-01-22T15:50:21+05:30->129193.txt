 Anupam recalled how Shoojit came to him with 'Piku' in 2015 and referred to his tracks from a previous Bengali film and asked him to keep it the way he would do in Bengali. 
 
 The singer, who also sung two numbers in Shoojit co-produced 'Pink', said he is   to more Hindi films working from Kolkata but won't sign unless becoming impressed by the subject of the film. 
 
 Anupam, who had recorded songs on a wide ranging issues, said he did not want to create segment. 
 
 "Not all songs are written for the singer himself, but to carry forward a certain situation in the film, to bolster the message of the film," said the 'Zulfiqar' music creator.
