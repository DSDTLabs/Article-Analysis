NEW DELHI: The income tax department has summoned RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s daughter and   member   Bharti as well as her husband to investigate transactions related to their properties. 

 The summons were issued as part of the “normal practice” to record statements following recent searches, said an officer. Misha and her husband   have been asked to appear before the investigating officer early next month. 
 
 Misha and Shailesh face allegations of owning properties transferred to them at prices below the market rates when Prasad was Union railway minister. Some of the properties are in Delhi, including one in the upscale   and a farmhouse in Bijwasan. Last week, searches were conducted at various premises of businessmen linked to Prasad, the former Bihar CM who was railway minister during UPA-I’s tenure. 
 
 The summons to Misha and her husband come a day after the arrest of chartered accountant   by the Enforcement Directorate. Agrawal is alleged to have advised Prasad’s kin. The former RJD chief, who has been convicted of corruption in a fodder scam case and faces other charges, has denied any wrongdoing. His two sons, ministers in the   government in Bihar, also face allegations of being shareholders in firms that acquired properties during Prasad’s stint at the Centre.
