BENGALURU | NEW DELHI:   chief   on Wednesday surrendered before a trial court in Bengaluru and was sent to the city’s   jail, where she was likely to share cell with two other inmates.
 
  As soon as the   vehicles which accompanied Sasikala’s car to Bengaluru arrived in the city, unidentified persons vandalised the convoy. The miscreants shouted: “You killed Amma.”
  
  The police had to resort to baton charging to disperse the unruly crowd. Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court rejected Sasikala’s plea requesting more time to surrender, forcing her to start her four-year jail term in Bengaluru later in the day.
  
  “We have already spoken through our judgement. We don’t want to change one word of it,” Justice   told Sasikala’s lawyer KTS Tulsi, dismissing the plea outright.
  
  “We said surrender immediately,” he said, berating her for seeking more time to surrender.
