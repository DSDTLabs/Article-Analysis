PATNA: CM   on Saturday directed the DMs of all the 38 districts to take stock of the damages caused to Rabi crops by the erratic weather conditions since Friday evening and send their reports to the   soon. 

 Lightning, thunderstorm and even hailstorm have lashed the state since Friday evening. This has led to   (BSDMA) vice-chairman Vyasji releasing an advisory which also focuses on ways to avoid lightning like not standing under trees or in groups. 
 
 The advisory has been sent texted to 1.45 lakh people, including listed officials of the districts and blocks as well as mukhiyas, ward members and councillors for broadcast to others.
 
 Rabi crops like wheat, winter wheat, pulses and oilseeds had almost matured, awaiting harvest with the onset of hot and dry westerly winds from March end, but the weather played spoilsport.
 
 Akhilesh Kumar Singh, a farmer from   village in Falka block of Katihar district, called up this correspondent to share his concerns. “Severe rain, thunderstorm and hailstorm in the month of Falgun of the Saka calendar spells disaster for farmers,” he said, quoting Ghaagh, an ancient seer who was believed to be an expert on agriculture and weather cycles.
 
 The Met department has warned that there will be no respite from inclement weather conditions for a few days due to cyclone and western disturbances. “Such weather conditions are not abnormal. They occur around this time of the year,” Vyasji said.
