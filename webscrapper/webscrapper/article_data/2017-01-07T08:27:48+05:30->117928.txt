MADURAI/SALEM:   general secretary V K   has exhorted party functionaries to defeat the conspiracy by rivals to defame AIADMK.

 Sasikala, who met district functionaries of the party on Friday in Chennai, urged them not to leave room for rivals to succeed in the conspiracy to spread canards about AIADMK. Sasikala, who is holding a series of meetings with functionaries from across the state from Jan 4, met partymen from Salem, Namakkal, Erode, Dindigul, Theni, Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram and Virudhunagar in two sessions on Friday. “She told us that rivals were attempting to defame the AIADMK unable to digest the growth of the party. She attributed the adverse media reports to this conspiracy. She urged us to work harder to defeat the designs of the rivals,’’ said a functionary from Salem, seeking anonymity.
 
 Partymen said she made short speeches lasting for less than ten minutes. Assuring the functionaries that AIADMK would grow stronger on the path laid by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa, Sasikala had asked partymen to hold frequent meetings to ensure they are in constant touch with grassroot cadres and the public. “She wanted us to conduct street corner meetings every month and inform the public about the achievements of the state government,” a functionary from Madurai said.
 
 Sasikala had also asked them to convene meetings of party officeberers at the Union level every three months and district level once in six months, he said. Sasikala told them she was always there to help them build the party. She reiterated her earlier instruction to celebrate party founder M G Ramachandran’s birth anniversary in a grand manner.
 
 More than 200 AIADMK functionaries from Salem and Namakkal districts participated in the meeting while an equal number had come from the southern districts too. Later, she allowed key functionaries to take photos with her.
