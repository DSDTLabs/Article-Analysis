New Delhi: A 47% voter turnout for the   Garden   was much lower compared to the last two assembly elections. Election commission officials said the reconciliation of votes was still on and the number could slightly go up.

 In the 2013 assembly elections, the turnout was 68%, and even better — at 72% — in 2015. In an example of how slow things were to start with on Sunday, just 80 of the 1,000 registered   turned up at Cambridge School in Rajouri Garden till 11.30am. 
 
 While glitches were reported from several booths, state election commission officials said one EVM was replaced and 38 Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail machines changed due to “technical” problems.
 
 The bypoll is significant as it will soon be followed by elections to the three municipal corporations where AAP, BJP and Congress are locked in a three-way battle. As a result, the three parties roped in heavyweights to campaign for the bypoll. 
 
 The seat was left vacant after AAP MLA Jarnail Singh resigned to contest the Punjab assembly election against Shiromani Akali Dal patron Parkash Singh Badal. SAD-BJP candidate Manjinder Singh Sirsa had won it in the 2013 assembly elections. In 2015, however, he was defeated by Jarnail Singh by 10,036 votes.
