AHMEDABAD: The three-day ‘Golden Jubilee Reunion’ of the second postgraduate programme batch of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) began on the campus on Friday. The event commemorates 50 years to the year the batch graduated. The group will have a lot to do over three days at the campus, for the first such golden jubilee reunion, a statement from IIM-A said.

 IIM-A officials said 32 alumni of the 1967 batch participated in the reunion. There were 12,000 candidates in 1967 who had taken entrance exam for the IIM and 120 were shortlisted for IIM-A. Some 76 students had accepted the offer. “Twelve people from that batch are in the USA and 19 have passed away. The remaining 32 have come to take part in the golden jubilee celebrations,” an official said.
 
 The statement said the alumni will travel down memory lane during this reunion. Then, there was no campus and they lived in the   flats at Ambawadi which was a make-shift office for the institute and dormitories for the students. Division A of the batch was assigned a classroom in ATIRA, while the B Division had a classroom at the   near  . This meant some had to trudge through fields which could get slushy in the rains to get to class, said the statement.
