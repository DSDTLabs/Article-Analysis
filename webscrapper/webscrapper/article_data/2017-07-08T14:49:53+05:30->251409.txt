VISAKHAPANAM: A mother and her daughter, residents of Pendurthi lodged a complaint with city police commissioner, T Yoganand on Friday against  , Peela Govinda Satyanarayana and financier   who allegedly threatened the duo with dire consequences to grab their house.

 The complainants,Sheik Adabi and Sheik Afroz run a wholesale business of biscuits and chocolates. 
 
 Adabi took Rs 2.5 lakh from the financier at Rs 6 towards interest for every Rs 100. 
 
 While paying the interest, Adabi borrowed another Rs 3 lakh from the same financier and the debt rose to Rs 8 lakh. Though she paid him Rs 6 lakh, she failed to return rest of the amount due to the demonetisation move by the government in November last year. 
 
 “Financially, I was in such a bad shape that I was even ready to sell off my house. I urged the financier to settle the matter for Rs 5 lakh. He had taken my signatures on a blank sheet with Rs 100 stamp, while lending me the money. Now he is trying to take the possession of my house,” rued Adabi. 
 
 When she turned down the proposal to hand over the house, the financier and henchmen of the accused MLA forcibly took Adabi and her daughter from her brother’s house in   on Thursday .
 
 The mother and her daughter were allegedly confined in a room for hours in the MLA’s house. “The financier and the MLA teamed up with Dr   and others to beat us. They threatened to kill us and grab our house,” Adabi said in her complaint.
