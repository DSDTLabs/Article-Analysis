DARBHANGA: The newlywed girls of Maithil Brahmin families accompanied by their husbands celebrated Madhushravani festival in Mithilanchal on Wednesday. This is a festival of serpent worship performed by newly married couples.

 The 13-day ritual commences on the fifth lunar day of the first fortnight of Shravan and completes on the third lunar day of the second fortnight of the month. For 12 days, the ritual is performed by the newly married girls only. On the 13th and last day (Madhushravani), the couple performs the rituals. Madhushravani initiates the newly married girls into the worldly life.
 
 Girls on each of the 12 days move in the gardens in bridal clothes and collect seasonal flowers, leaves of trees and put them in baskets made of bamboos and then worship ‘Naga Devta’, ‘Gauri’, ‘Shanti Kalash’, ‘Surya’, ‘Chandrama’, ‘Navagrah’ and several nags such as ‘Nag Dampati’, ‘Bairasi’ along with hundred brothers, Chanai, Kusumawati, Pingla, Lili, Gosauni Nag with seven sisters and lastly Shasthi or Sathi in a temple or at home. A senior family woman narrates stories every day during the 12-day period. These stories are religious anecdotes aimed at making the girls aware of their duties.
 
 A group of married women sit with the bride to eat Kheer and Puri with her.
 
 According to Mohini Jha, author of a book titled ‘Rituals & Festivals of Mithila’, the spiritual power of fidelity, the faithfulness of a wife to her husband and vice versa, which ultimately leads to salvation has been emphasized. Most of the songs of this period are related to the marriage of Shiva and Parvati, like Maheshbani and Nachari. Prati and kohbar songs relates to Sita and Lord Ram.
