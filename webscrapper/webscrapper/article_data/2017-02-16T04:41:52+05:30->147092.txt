JAIPUR: The   (GRP) registered a case against actor   for damaging public property, and rioting at the   railway station while promoting his film ‘Raees’ last month. GRP Kota SHO G S   told TOI that the complaint was filed by food vendor Vikram Singh on Tuesday. “On the morning of January 24,   arrived at the railway station by Kranti express. 

 During the train’s brief halt, the actor did not get off the train but waved at his fans and threw gifts towards them, which caused a stampede-like situation,” Sharma said. 
 
 In his complaint, Singh alleged that he was standing at platform one when a gift landed on his trolley. During the next few minutes, his trolley, and the food and beverages on it were damaged as a mob rushed towards him to claim the gift. Some people took advantage of the chaos and stole money from his cashbox. Singh also alleged that he got injured in the melee. He lodged a complaint at a railway court, following which GRP filed an FIR.
