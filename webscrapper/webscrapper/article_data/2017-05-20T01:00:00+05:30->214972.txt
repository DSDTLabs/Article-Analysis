Actress   was in the news recently when her husband of eight years,  , went missing for four days following an altercation with her. 

 A source close to the couple said, “Sangeita has been wanting to separate from Chirag. She recently told him that she wants to move on and that’s what upset him and he left the city. When he couldn’t be traced, his family filed a missing complaint. Fortunately, after four days, Chirag returned. They have been staying separately since.” 
 
 When contacted, Chirag said, “I am hoping for a reconciliation with my wife. I don’t want to talk about anything else.” 
 
 Incidentally, Sangeita had kept her marital status under wraps for many years. When quizzed about it, Chirag replied, “It was a mutual decision. I would always introduce myself as her boyfriend when she was working down South. But when she bagged 'Ek Shringaar — Swabhiman', neither the production house nor the channel asked her about her marriage.” 
 
 
  
 Meanwhile, there are rumours about Sangeita’s growing proximity to her 'Swabhiman' co-actor  . The actress, however, refuted the buzz, saying, “Saahil and I are just friends. The rest of it is my personal life, which I would keep personal.”
 
 Saahil added, “Sangeita and I just friends and we aren’t dating.”
