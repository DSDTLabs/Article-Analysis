BHUBANESWAR:  , foggy mornings and chilly winds were the order of the day in most parts of the state with the return of the cold wave-like chill in Odisha.

 The immediate after effect of the biting cold has been thin attendance in parks, public gardens and among those who take to the streets in the mornings to jog, run or walks.
 
 "Cold winds blowing in from the north has led to the sudden drop in temperature in Odisha. Several places have recorded temperatures 7 to 8o than lesser than normal. Night temperature is likely to drop further during the next 48 hours, but day temperature will remain unchanged," said the director of IMD's Bhubaneswar centre,  . 
 
 According to Sahoo, the temperature in north Odisha will reduce further but in the state's interiors, which include places like Phulbani and Kandhamal, temperatures will show a rising trend from January 16 onwards.

Bhubaneswar and Cuttack recorded minimum temperatures of 13.9o C and 11.8o C, respectively. 
 
 "We are actually enjoying the cold in the city. It's neither very chilly nor very uncomfortable, but quite pleasant. I have many pullovers and jackets, which I hardly get a chance to wear in Bhubaneswar, but this time I have brought them out," said  , a young executive living in the city. 
 
 Apart from woollens and knit-wears, the drop in temperature has brought about a rise in the popularity of brightly coloured silks and tussars. "This year, half Nehru jackets have grown into a great favourite among men, while women are wearing colourful silk," said Niharika, a student of the National Institute of Fashion Technology here.
