HYDERABAD: Delay and negligence in collecting and handling semen samples from rape survivors and crime-scene clothes by police and doctors often wipe out vital DNA fingerprinting evidence in sexual assault cases, including   and other parts of the state. In most rape cases, police fail to send samples to   for either serological examination or DNA fingerprinting. 

  Dr G Pandu said, the lab that serves both Telugu states received samples in at least 1,000 rape cases for serological examination in a year, whereas only 300 tested positive for semen. 
 
 In Telangana, according to   around 1,200 rape cases are reported every year and 1,000  .
 
 Speaking to TOI, FSL expert Dr G Pandu said, "After serological examination, if it turns positive for semen presence, we take up DNA fingerprinting. Delay and defective methods adopted in collection, result in serological examination turning negative for presence of semen. Recently, we extracted DNA samples from a woman's body even 12 hours after it was dumped in a well at Vizianagaram. Semen was not affected as the body did not decompose and it was inside the genital cavity." 
 
 Dr M Narayana Reddy, a forensic professor told TOI, "Police have to take blame for delay in taking rape survivors to the nearest hospital for medical examination. If victims are kids they go to toilet and clean up. Doctors who collect samples at hospitals often fail to take precautions. They need to be trained by experts from CDFD and FSL. Sterile swabs have to be used to collect samples and dried. The medical officer collecting swabs should wear gloves and cover his mouth. Or there's a possibility of contamination of the sample."
