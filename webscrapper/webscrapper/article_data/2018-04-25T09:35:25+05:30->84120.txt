BENGALURU: As individuals and players   and   are diametrically opposite. The same holds good when it comes to their captaincy as well. While Dhoni wears the ‘captain cool’ attitude with ease, Kohli’s aggression is often on display.

 
 When Chennai Super Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore face off in the marquee clash, a blockbuster contest is expected and lot of it will depend on the two captains. While there is a lot of buzz around the Dhoni v Kohli match-up, Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming chose to play it down.
 
 “I don't think it is as big a subplot as what it was maybe years back. So, it is going to be a good contest with two of India’s finest players captaining teams. It makes for a great game, that’s for sure. But in terms of any other pressure or anything, it's just a good contest.”
 
 But Fleming was quick to admit that emotions run high while playing RCB. “It is a special match, given the proximity of the two cities. There is a lot of interest and emotions. We have always enjoyed the encounters and have seen some great ones over the years. I don’t think Wednesday will be any different. Both the teams are very talented. We got over the line a couple of times more this season, so we’ve seen a little bit more of the winning form,” said the New Zealander.
