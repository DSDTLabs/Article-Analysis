THANE: From a barren land studded with rocks and weeds, to a healthy thriving green pasture that has been attracting a world of biodiversity, it took a Thane   less than a year to transform the 19-hectare arid forest land in Titwala’s   region into a green one.

 
  
  
 
 In January last year, the forest department had handed over this barren land adjoining the   in Titwala’s Runde area to Paryavaran Dakshata Mandal for this seven-year-long project on a tri-party agreement.
 
  
  
 From clearing the weeds and levelling the land to planting close to 8,000 two-year-old home grown saplings and nurturing them on a daily basis, the members of the NGO, with the help of numerous volunteers and a team of labourers have been working non-stop towards reviving the lost greenery here since the start of the monsoon.
 
  
  
 Their efforts seem to have already borne fruit as their plantation drive titled the Devrai project has witnessed a 98 per cent survival rate till date.
  
  
  
 “When we started the project, our main aim was to bring back the greenery this area once had. We began by studying the soil, water and other aspects of the land. To ensure the project’s success, we had to plant saplings which we knew would survive,” said  , a member of the NGO. 
 
  
  
 
 Conservator of forest (social forestry) K D Thakare, who recently visited the location, said, “We have numerous such tri-party projects with non-governmental groups where they are given a piece of the forest land to revive. Less than a year after this project started, the NGO has managed to revive the areas lost green cover. 
 
  
  
 
 The greenery has also started attracting birds, insects and fauna. It is becoming a complete eco-system once again.”
