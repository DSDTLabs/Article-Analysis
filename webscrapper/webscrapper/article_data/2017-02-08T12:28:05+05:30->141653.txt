PANAJI:   (GSEC) has proposed May 21 as the date to conduct panchayats polls. The five-year term of 189 panchayats ends in May. The last elections were held on May 16, 2012.

 The proposed date of election has to be approved by the state government. A secretariat official said though they have received the proposal, the decision on the finalization of the   will happen only after the new government is formed, which will happen after March 11. “It is possible that the new government will stick to the dates suggested by the GSEC,” the officer said. 
 
 Goa has 190 village panchayats. In 2016, the government decided to create a new panchayat of Quelossim, separating it from Cortalim. Panchayat elections will be interesting this time, as they will happen within three months of the new government taking over. The new MLAs, especially the first-timers will try and wrestle control of panchayats in their respective constituencies to establish their hold.
