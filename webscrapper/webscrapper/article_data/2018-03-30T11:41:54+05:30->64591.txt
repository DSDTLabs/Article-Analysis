TRICHY: People queued at several ATM centres in the city on Wednesday to withdraw money as they said that there might be cash deficit in the centres over the course of next four days due to public holidays and weekend.

 Mahavir Jayanti was celebrated on March 29 (Thursday) and Good Friday is celebrated on March 30 (Friday). The general conception among people is that whenever there is a long holiday or an extended weekend, there would be cash deficit at ATM centres.
 
 “On Wednesday night, a lot of people – especially college students – queued at the ATM, thinking that they would not be able to withdraw cash on the subsequent days,” said  , a security person at a   centre at Williams Road and added that he was not used to seeing a lot of people during the month ends.
 
 A college student, S  , who had gone to withdraw money at the State Bank of India’s ATM near   on Thursday, also said that he had come thinking that cash might not be available, however, ATM had cash.
 
 However, bank officials stated that there always is a misconception that ATMs would not have money during extended holidays and said that advance arrangements are made during such days.
 
 In banks like SBI, case study of every ATM in the city is taken and based on that money at the respective centres is deposited, based on the requirement. “We don’t have a fixed amount that would be deposited in every ATM, but we do it based on the results from the case study,” an official at   stated and added that for March 29 and 30 the money was deposited keeping in mind it was the end of the month.
 
 An official from Punjab National Bank also said that double the amount of money was deposited at the ATMs since Thursday and Friday were public holidays and that the bank would be working on Saturday.
