 Parliamentary affairs minister Rajendra Rathore said, "We will approach the Supreme Court with a review petition. A committee formed by the state government will discuss the Supreme Court's order in a meeting on Saturday." 
 
 Officials including   Vyas, principal secretary, law, and others will take part in the meeting.
