KHAGARIA: The Mahila Mahavidylaya,  , a constituent unit of Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University (TMBU), lacks basic facilities and infrastructure even after 45 years of its establishment.

 While science and commerce streams are not taught here, the college has no common room, playground, hostel, sports and recreation facilities.
 
 The University Grants Commission (UGC) had sanctioned Rs 80 lakh under the 10th Five Year plan for construction of a hostel. The first instalment of Rs 50 lakh was released about five years ago. “We could not start any construction as a portion of the land meant for construction of the hostel has been encroached by some residents of the area,” said the principal,  .
 
 This lone centre for higher education for women in the district was established in 1973 with the initiative of former MLA late Kedar Narain Singh Azad, some teachers of local Kosi College, some businessmen of the town and several social activists.
 
 With only 65 students on the roll, initially classes were held at the local Arya Kanya Secondary School, a minority institution. The college was granted affiliation by TMBU in 1981 following an approval from the state education development for teaching arts subject upto degree level. It became a constituent unit of TMBU in 1987.
 
 A small plot of land was donated by the local Shyamlal Trust during the tenure of the then Khagaria DM Sudhir Tripathi in Baluahi locality of the town, on which the college building has been constructed. The college building was constructed utilizing a donation of Rs 6 lakh granted by late Jagdambi Mandal, the then   member.
