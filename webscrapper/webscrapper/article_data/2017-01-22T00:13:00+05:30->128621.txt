Thiruvananthapuram:   state president   said here on Thursday that a party delegation would soon go to New Delhi and seek the Centre’s intervention to ensure law and order in the state. The party decision comes in the wake of BJP worker Santhosh’s murder, allegedly by CPM workers, on Wednesday.

 A BJP-RSS delegation, led by Rajasekharan and   state chief Gopalankutty, met chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan here earlier in the day and demanded immediate steps to ensure peace in   district.
 
 Rajasekharan said BJP national president Amit Shah had deputed Meenakshi Lekhi MP and BJP national general secretary V Muraleedhar Rao to study and report on the law and order situation in Kerala. “The team is expected to reach the state soon,” he said. tnn
