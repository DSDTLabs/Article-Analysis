PANAJI: A lengthy, two-decade long process of identifying private forests and a delay in demarcating and mapping the identified patches in   ( ) 2021 has led to irreversible diversion of green cover and degradation of unidentified patches in Goa.

 Environmentalists allege that Goa’s rich natural heritage, estimated to be 250 sq km in private forests itself, has suffered massive damage, as two government-appointed committees; the Sawant committee managed to identify only 46.89 sq km by December 1999 and the Karapurkar committee, an additional 20.18 sq km by 2002.
 
 Two more committees for North and South Goa have carried forward the process of classifying more areas through field visits. But a few factors, including lack of surveyors to carry out the ground verification and mapping the areas, has sabotaged and delayed the whole process, activists alleged.
 
 “The two committees only identified the forests more than a decade ago, but surveying and mapping was not done. This even prompted   owners to resort to illegal felling and attempts to change land use,” environmentalist Ramesh Gauns said.
 
 Goa is one of the country’s few states to have pursued the apex court’s direction in identifying private forest cover. “The state showed good initiative, but delay in marking boundaries on the ground has led to degradation of private forests,” an activist said.
 
 The government is trying to engage the services of more surveyors to complete the work after national green tribunal directed it to appoint more technical hands. “The two committees have identified more areas, in addition to 67 sq km earlier, including at least 80 sq km in north Goa,” a source said.
 
 Goa’s 3,702-sq km geographical area comprises 543 sq km of very dense forest (VDF), 585 sq km of moderately dense forest (MDF) and 1,102 of open forest, as per the latest 2012-15 report of forest survey of India (FSI).
 
 But, this fact has induced destructive tendencies among successive governments on the grounds that Goa has a large forest cover. “The government has allowed even access to mining companies in its forest and that, too, in the catchment of Selaulim dam for transportation of ore,” Gauns said.
 
 Goa Foundation (GF) and other activists have been engaged in a legal battle to ensure marking of physical limits of these forests at the earliest and to prevent large-scale destruction in one of India’s greenest states.
 
 “The exercise of identification of private forests needs to be completed urgently, so as not to allow its degradation, on the grounds that the relevant survey numbers are not officially identified as ‘forest’, as such, in expert committee reports. The complete identification of private forests in Goa will also fulfill the directions of the   order dated December 12, 1996,” a GF plea stated.
 
 Nature lovers assert that mapping of identified forest areas should be a top priority. “These forest areas should be consolidated and their protection should be made a top priority, as forests are vital ecosensitive areas, which store water and help sustain populations through its produce and food, including fish,” said environmental activist, Siddharth Karapurkar.

 (I)Each State Government should constitute within one month an Expert Committee to:
 
 (i) Identify areas which are "forests", irrespective of whether they are so notified, recognised or classified Page 11 (J) Appln. Nos.14 & 16 (THC) of 2013 NGT (WZ) under, any law, and irrespective of ,the ownership of the land of such forest;
 
 (ii) Identify the areas which were earlier forest, but stand degraded, denuded, cleared and,
 
 (iii) to identify the areas covered by plantations.

 The criteria adopted by committees to identify areas of private forests: 
 
 (a) 75% of tree composition should be the forestry species,
 
 (b) The area should be contiguous to the Govt.
 
 forest and if in isolation, the minimum area should be 5 Ha,
 
 (c) Canopy density should not be less than 0.4.
