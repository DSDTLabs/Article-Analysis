GURUGRAM: A group of four people, going towards   in a pick-up truck allegedly with smuggled cows, when stopped by a   team, allegedly fired shots in the air to escape.

 A group of four people, belonging to Bajrang Dal and Gau Raksha Dal Manesar, waited on the Sohna-Palwal road since 3am, after being tipped-off that the truck would cross the area with smuggled cows.
 
 Monu alias Mohit, a member of the gau raksha dal, told police around 5am, they spotted the truck coming from the Ballabhgarh side, carrying cows whose mouths and legs were tied. Though they asked the gang to stop, the truck started speeding towards Sohna. At Ambedkar Chowk, a little ahead, when forced to stop at a traffic jam, it reversed and started speeding towards Palwal. By this time, the gau rakshaks had set up a road block near Silani village. When the ‘smugglers’ arrived, the gau rakshaks chased them in their car. According to Mohit, the ‘smugglers’ let the cows out on the road to stall them and started firing in the air. Soon, they abandoned the vehicles and ran into the fields, continuing to fire in the air.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Mohit said cops were present when the incident happened, though, according to the FIR, a call to the PCR was made only after the ‘smugglers’ fired in the air.
 
 ASI Surjeet Singh of Sohna police station said, “We’ve recovered two live rounds from the truck.” An FIR was registered under Section 13(2) of Haryana Gau Samrakshan and Gau Samvardhan Act, 2015, Section 25 of the Arms Act, Section 285 of IPC and Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, at Sohna police station.
