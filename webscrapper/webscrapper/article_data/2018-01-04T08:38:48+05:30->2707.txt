AHMEDABAD: After a   that claimed 14 lives in Mumbai on December 29, the entire country took stock of   and started efforts to plug in the loopholes. Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in first three days of 2018 have   and demolished extended parts of five other eateries.

 A fire safety expert pointed out loopholes in the regulations and conflicts. “The reason is, all modifications take place after the building is given NOC ahead of Building Use (BU) permission. There is no periodic check as the number of buildings flouting norms increase year after year and only an incident like Uphaar Cinema or Kumbakonam or Mumbai wakes up authorities,” said an expert. He said the plethora of rules and regulations are used selectively. “There is no uniform fire code. While municipal corporations have their own sets of rules under The Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporations (Amendment) Act, 2017, we also have Gujarat Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2013, General Development Control Regulations for 2021 which are not in sync,” said the expert.
 
 While Surat has separate fire and disaster management committee, no other cities have it. Experts pointed out that cities like Rajkot and Bhavnagar don’t have fire staff to implement fire safety measures. “The logistic and administrative roles of already existing bodies such as fire services authority are needed,” said an official.
