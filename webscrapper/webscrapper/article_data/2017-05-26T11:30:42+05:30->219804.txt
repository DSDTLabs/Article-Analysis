COIMBATORE: A prima facie case of electrocution has after one-and-a-half years turned out to be a case of cold-blooded   and a 54-year-old man has been arrested in connection with it.

 J Rasathi, 45, of   in  , was found dead in a   located in the same locality on October 10, 2015. The farm owner, A  , 54, also from Kuniyamuthur, claimed that she was electrocuted.
 
 The Kuniyamuthur police registered a case under Section 174 CrPC (suspicious death). The postmortem report, however, revealed that Rasathi had sustained severe head injuries and had died of the same.
 
 The police investigation, meanwhile, revealed that there was a power cut in the locality during the day on October 10, 2015. The police also obtained statements from the electricity department staff. But, they failed to make any progress in the case and it was more or less in a stalled state.
 
 The Kuniyamuthur police resumed the investigation six months ago and conducted inquiry with the relatives of Rasathi.
 
  They told the police that she had an affair with the farm owner, Kannappan, for about 10 years and he often used to beat her with wooden log. They also told the police that chances of Kannappan murdering her were high.
 
 The police recorded their statements and altered the case to 302 (murder) of the IPC and arrested Kannappan. He has been lodged in the Coimbatore Central Prison.
 
 Why the police did not record the statements of the family members of the deceased soon after her death is still not known. Also, they failed to quiz the farm owner based on the postmortem report and statements of electricity department staff.
 
 “There is no direct evidence in the case. But, the circumstantial evidences are strong against Kannappan,” said a police officer.
