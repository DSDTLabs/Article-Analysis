VADODARA: At the age of just 13, city lad   has become one of the youngest author of the state.

  With the help of his mentor, Prem, a class VIII student, has authored a book – ‘Destiny’s Ride: Take it or Leave it’ – which was unveiled on Tuesday evening at Bal Bhavan. 
 
 Like many other teenagers, Prem too spends most of his time between his school and playing basketball. 
 
 But by authoring the book, he has fulfilled his long cherished dream that he had seen when he was in class V. 
 
 “I used to read lot of books since I was in class IV. It was then that one of my teachers suggested to my mother to get me into creative writing. Before writing this book on which I was working since last six months, I had also worked on two manuscripts,” said Prem, whose mother Jagruti is a housewife while father Hiren is into construction business. 
 
 ‘Destiny’s Ride: Take it or Leave it’ is a story of a boy living in Chicago, the   who loses his mother in a tragic accident and the circumstances that unfold after that. 
 
 “It is a fast-paced adventure, peppered with intrigue, subtle romance and gripping moments. Laced with the ordinary ingredients that life throws at one from time to time, it is a series of meandering events, topped by the unpredictability of human nature and the nuanced perception of children and their understanding of the adult world,” said Prem’s mentor and educationist  , who was working with her protégé since last six months to publish the book. 
 
 Interestingly, after summer vacations, Prem is planning to write a sequel to this book but does not want to become an author by profession. “I want to pursue it as a hobby. As a profession, I want to make a career in robotics,” he said.
