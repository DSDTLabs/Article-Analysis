IMPHAL: The Manipur government employees, who have been on strike since March 22, demanded on Sunday a written commitment from the government on when the 7th Pay   recommendations will be implemented. 

 The   (JAC), the apex body of the All Manipur Trade Unions' Council and the  , had earlier threatened to go on strike if the recommendations were not implemented. Even after the ceasework began, chief minister N   Singh asked workers to return to work, "failing which the government has to find other people to discharge their work". 
 
 L Biken, general secretary of JAC, said: "We are not saying that the enhanced pay should be given now. All what we want is that the government should give us a written commitment on when the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission will be implemented in Manipur." 
 
 Biken claimed that Biren's 'excuse' of not being able to implement the recommendations as Manipur is a resourceless state that depends mostly on the Centre does not hold water as the state government had already implemented the 4th, 5th and 6th Pay Commission recommendation. agencies
