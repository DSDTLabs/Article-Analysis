AHMEDABAD: Tonnes of stinking garbage and muck slid down the 55-metre high Pirana dump on Monday afternoon, burying two vehicles, including a earthmover and a car that was plying on the road connecting Pirana and Danilimda Crossroads. Locals from nearby areas rushed to help the car owner. After close to 45 minutes, the Ahmedabad fire brigade and   ( ) personnel reached the spot and it took around four hours to clear the mess with the help of five earthmovers.

 The incident took place at 2.30pm on Monday due to incessant rains in the area. The waste blocked the road from Pirana to Danilimda Crossroads. It was initially suspected that a few vehicles were stuck underneath the debris but the fire brigade denied it.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Rajesh Bhatt, additional chief fire officer,   (AFES), said that three teams have been deployed in Ahmedabad district with inflatable boats and equipment to rescue villagers in low-lying areas after warning of heavy rains on Monday night and Tuesday. “The boats and firemen have also been deployed in city areas as Sabarmati river would get inflow of water released in upstream,” he said. Ahmedabad on Monday received 56.72 mm rainfall since 6am to 10pm. The highest rainfall was witnessed at Kotarpur which received 79mm while Dudheshwar received 48.50mm rainfall.
