PANAJI: In the race to be the first Goan city to be linked to the piped city gas distribution network, Ponda municipal area and Old Goa stole a march on the state capital. With the Corporation of the City of Panaji denying permission to  , the capital’s citizens will have to wait longer to benefit from the convenience and cost benefits that the city gas distribution network offers.

 While   has given provisional permissions for laying of the piped city gas network, Old Goa panchayat has cleared the decks for Goa Natural Gas to lay the pipeline in the village. “We have approached Panaji, Ribandar and Ponda. Our permission applied for in January was processed only in April by CCP and ultimately we were denied permission to execute before the monsoon. We therefore intensified our efforts to get the permission of the Ponda Municipal Corporation and our proposal submitted at the end of March was recently processed by the  ,” chief executive officer KK Sachdeva said.
 
 Goa Natural Gas is a joint venture of   (GAIL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sachdeva pointed out that there were several benefits of the piped gas network. “Domestic natural gas will be supplied to households at concessional rates. At present, a clear cut 20% saving on subsidized LPG cylinder and 40% saving on non-subsidized cylinders is envisaged,” he said.
 
 Installation of meters to the piped gas network will prevent pilferage and billing will be done based on monthly consumption.
 
 However, Goa Natural Gas has found it challenging to get required permissions, said officials who have called for a single window system to ensure faster approvals. “Ambiguity with regard to authorities to be approached and overlapping jurisdictions of panchayats, corporations and PWD for taking permission is an issue. A single window clearance system will be effective for such time bound project.
