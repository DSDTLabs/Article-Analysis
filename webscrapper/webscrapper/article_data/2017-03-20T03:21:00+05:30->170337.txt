Panaji: Research Vessel RV Sindhu Sankalp, owned and operated by the CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), has successfully completed 100 oceanographic cruises in the seas around India. Scientists of the CSIR-NIO acquired invaluable data and samples to understand the ocean processes and map seafloor and water column variables. Originally built as a training vessel by the Japanese government, the vessel was acquired by the CSIR-NIO in 2008 and modified in 2009 as an oceanographic research vessel. “The vessel has been extensively used to deploy and recover instrumented mooring which record continuous data of various water column parameters, such as temperature, salinity, currents and nutrients, which are essential to understand ocean environment and associated ecosystem, including fisheries,” said NIO acting director Prasanna Kumar. For the 100th cruise, RV Sindhu Sankalp sailed from Visakhapatnam Port on March 2 with an objective to map parts of the Eastern Continental Margin of India, especially in the region off Visakhapatnam, with a multi-beam sonar system to unravel the seafloor morphology.
