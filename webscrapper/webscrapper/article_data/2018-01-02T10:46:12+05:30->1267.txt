CHANDIGARH: Panjab University (PU) is banking on emotions to spur former Prime Minister Dr   to visit his alma mater for the first time more than one-and-a-half years after he accepted the offer of professorship for the   Chair in April 2016.

 The university will approach Dr Manmohan to deliver the first Dr Rangnekar Memorial Lecture — Dr S   had taught the former PM economics in PU.
 
 Dr Manmohan has not visited PU despite coming to the city twice. “The department of economics has proposed a lecture in the memory of Dr Manmohan’s teacher.   was a father figure in the department. He had come from   to Chandigarh when the university campus was set up in the 1960s. He was the head of the department. Hopefully, we will succeed in bringing Dr Manmohan to PU,” said PU VC Prof Arun Kumar Grover.
 
 The university had earlier approached Dr Manmohan for the Dr   lecture, but, Grover said, he was reluctant. “I am now hopeful that he would deliver the Dr Rangnekar memorial lecture. However, I am still exploring this, it is wishful thinking that he delivers the lecture,” he said.
 
 Ajit Singh was the former Dr Manmohan Singh Chair professor at PU. His wife,  , had donated 5,000 UK Pounds to the department of economics as an endowment in November 2016 to finance the annual lecture in the memory of her husband.
 
 Dr Manmohan completed his masters in economics from PU in 1954 and joined as senior lecturer in economics department in 1957. He left in 1966, when he was appointed economic affairs officer (UNCTAD) at the UN Secretariat, New York.
