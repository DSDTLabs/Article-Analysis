 He slipped under the train and got cut into pieces. The robbers had struck again at the same location after a short break. In the recent past several incidents of robberies using similar modus operandi have been reported. Many people had lost their lives while several suffered serious injuries.
 
 “It is an unfortunate incident. We have kept a permanent point to stop such incidents near the spot of crime but had to move the cops for bandobast duty in Bharuch. Hence there was no round the clock police presence. The robbers took advantage of this and targeted the victim. Police teams are working to detect the crime. The robbers will be arrested soon,” said Sharad Singhal, superintendent of police, GRP.
