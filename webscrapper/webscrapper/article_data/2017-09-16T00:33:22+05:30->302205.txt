MUMBAI: Anti-corruption bureau (ACB) officials arrested a   posted in   and her husband, a teacher of a zilla parishad school in  , for allegedly demanding bribe. ACB sleuths found that the husband was accepting   on her behalf and that too at her official residence in Wardha.

 “We arrested Sangita Rathod and her husband Uttam Rajan Chavan and booked them under the Prevention of Corruption Act. We will ensure the case is disposed of in a time-bound period,” an ACB official said.
 
 Last week, a convener of a women   lodged a complaint with the ACB claiming that the sub-divisional magistrate had demanding Rs 50,000 from him for extending the period of the on-going self-employment exhibition at Pulgaon in Wardha district. The self-help group had organized the exhibition during the 10-day Ganesh festival.
 
 After prolonged negotiations, Sangita allegedly settled at Rs 25,000, said an ACB official. All the meetings between the complainant and Sangita were carefully monitored by ACB sleuths. 
 
 At the final meeting on Wednesday, when the complainant reached Sangita’s office, she asked him to hand over the money to a person at her residence. Accompanied by ACB sleuths, the complainant reached her official residence and handed over the money to Uttam. During interrogation, he disclosed he was Sangita’s husband.
