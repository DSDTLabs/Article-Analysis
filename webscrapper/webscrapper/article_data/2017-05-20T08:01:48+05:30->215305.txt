ALLAHABAD:   after laying of   has turned otherwise  , with   covering the holes dug for the   in the city. 

 The work executed by the Ganga Pollution Control Unit has affected several important roads, including ones that lead to prominent government hospitals like Beli Hospital, Kolvin Hospital, besides several private hospitals and institutions of the city. As a result, patients visiting these hospitals are facing inconvenience. 
 
 The entire stretch of Stanley Road, right from Mayo Hall to MNNIT crossing, is full of such potholes despite the fact that the road is otherwise smooth. The agency has covered the openings, made for cleaning the sewer pipelines, using concrete slabs. However, while repairing the road, these openings have not been properly levelled. 
 
 The problem worsens when commuters fail to notice these pits right in the middle of the road, making the around five-kilometer stretch a bumpy ride. Commuters said that the agency concerned should repair the road properly as there are two hospitals on this road, one being Tej Bahadur Sapru Hospital, an important government hospital of the district. 
 
 Another blunder on the road is that right outside the hospital, the authorities have constructed a speed breaker which is without the paint stripes to alert commuters of the hump.
 
 Daily commuters are now accustomed to the hazard, but those visiting the city hospital from outside mainly for emergency treatment are getting inconvenienced, said Rajendra Tripathi, a local resident. 
 
 Project manager of Ganga Pollution Control Unit, J P Mani agreed that ideally commuters should not have to face such a situation. "The unit will take up the issue on a priority basis," Mani said.
