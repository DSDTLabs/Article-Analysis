AHMEDABAD: More than 1,000 farmers submitted a memorandum to collector Mehul Dave at his office on Tuesday, seeking land ownership under the Forest Rights Act 2006. Ten years after the Union government entitled tribal farmers to land ownership, the state government has only given cultivation rights—that too on a small portion of land—to tribal farmers,  , which supported the farmers in their fight, has alleged.

 After submitting the memorandum, Eklavya Trust held a protest march from   to Sardar Baug near Nehru Bridge. Tribal farmers from Banaskantha, Sabarkantha, Dahod and Panchmahal, among other districts were present. “Even ten years after the law was passed by the then   government, it hasn’t been implemented in the state. The farmers have only been given cultivation rights and that too on a portion of the land which they have owned for decades,” said Prof Hemant Shah, a representative of the Eklavya Sangathan.
 
 The state has admitted to having received individual claims of more than 1.82 lakh tribals but merely 74,000 of these were approved. “None of these claims approved by the state government have been granted land-ownership rights,” said Shah. This has made the plight of tribal farmers worse, as they face several other issues and struggle to make ends meet. “Irrigation is also a major issue. Despite the Narmada dam project, we don’t have enough water for irrigation. Due to this, hardly 20% of the total crop is of good quality, which can be sold in the market.,” said Pandav Kamaji, a farmer from Budrasan village of Arvalli district.
