HYDERABAD: Heavy rainfall accompanied by hail and thunderstorm wreaked havoc in parts of the city for nearly two hours on Friday, bringing down mercury levels to 24 degree Celsius by 8.30 pm.

 Hailstorms accompanied by strong winds lashed areas such as Krishna Nagar, Ameerpet, Borabanda, Kukatpally, Erragadda, Begumpet,  , Secunderabad, Abids, Nampally and other adjoining areas.
 
 Tree branches fell, blocking the flow of traffic in several areas, including Banjara Hills, SR Nagar,   market, Vengal Rao Nagar, Uppal, Chandanagar and Vidyanagar. The winds also tore through hoardings, leaving them in tatters.
 
 The heavy rainfall also plunged many areas of the city, including Bowenpally, Jaya Nagar, Hyderguda, Moosarambagh, Mothi Mahal, Yakuthpura, Petlaburz, Teegalaguda and Falaknuma, into darkness as power supply tripped, forcing   chairman and managing director   to make a trip to the central control room to direct officials to restore power as soon as possible.
