NAVI MUMBAI: The state public works department (PWD) is considering a proposal from the city police about setting up a barrier on both edges of   in order to curb suicides. 

 The proposal has been sent to the higher-ups for approval, said PWD officer in-charge of roads and bridges, P Lahane. “A height barrier can become a hurdle for those who want to jump into the sea,” the official said.
 
 In the last 10 days, there have been two suicides and one attempt from the bridge. It has become like a ‘suicide point’, said police inspector (traffic) R Babshetty.
 
 City activist   said, “Last year, a few like-minded citizens had also suggested that inspirational posters and banners be displayed at the Vashi bridge in order to counsel people against ending their lives.” 
 
  The PWD and local police must carry out frequent patrolling to curb suicides on the bridge, the activist added.
 
 “We often look out for pedestrians and motorists who stop by the bridge. We reach out to them and if they are contemplating suicide, we try to dissuade them from jumping over the bridge. In the last three months, we have stopped nearly 12 persons from killing themselves,” a Vashi-based fisherman,  , said.
 
 Last Saturday, a 22-year-old youth from Govandi jumping off the Vashi bridge. He had come to the spot from Shivajinagar in an auto and walked to the middle of the bridge to jump off. His body was fished out after 30 minutes.
