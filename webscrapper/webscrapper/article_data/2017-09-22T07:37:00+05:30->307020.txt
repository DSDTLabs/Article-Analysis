Newly-appointed Panchkula municipal commissioner 

 Rajesh Jogpal has said he would not tolerate any delay in development work and if quality of work goes down, the concerned official should be ready for legal action against him. Soon after taking over as the MC 
 
 commissioner at the MC office in Sector 14, Jogpal spoke to 
 
 TOI correspondent Arvind Bishnoi about his upcoming plans for the development of the city.
 
 What will be your priority after taking up the charge of Panchkula MC chief?
 
 I am a resident of Panchkula and know this city very well. I will not tolerate any kind of delay in development work and will work in coordination with the agendas of the house.
 
 Panchkula MCs have always been very controversial due to high political interference here. What is your take?
 
 I am here for the development of the city. Politics will stand out of my office.
 
  What you have shared with your staff on your first day in office?
 
 I have clearly told my subordinates that in any case, if quality of work goes down, the concerened official will be punished as per law.
 
 The post of Panchkula MC is infamous for delaying all kinds of development works?
 
  Yeah, I got to know about this through media. But my focus is to complete all the work in a time-bound manner on the lines of the Gurugram MC.
 
  Basic problems like repair of roads, menace of stray cattle, stray dogs, encroachment have not been addressed by the MC in the past four years. How will you manage it?
 
  During my first meeting with the officers today, I discussed all the issues. A plan for these has been prepared and work will be initiated soon.
 
 What is the one message you have for the residents?
 
 I am going to issue a whatsapp number where residents are free to share their problems and the same will be solved in best possible time. I also request the retired bureaucrats, Army officials, engineers to help MC by giving valuable inputs.
