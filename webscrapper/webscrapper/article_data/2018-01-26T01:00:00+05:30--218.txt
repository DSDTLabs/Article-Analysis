Actress  , who was last seen in ' ', was recently in Kanpur to promote her serial ' '. Having visited the industrial town earlier also, Jiya says she has fallen in love with the state.
Having shot for the serial in Varanasi and later, promoted it in cities like Lucknow and Agra, Jiya says she has fallen in love with UP. "Jabse maine 'Meri Hanikarak Biwi' ke liye shoot karna start kiya hai tab se UP se rishta sa ban gaya hai. I was in Varanasi for the shooting. Though it was my first time there, I really loved the city. Shooting at the ghats of Ganga was a divine experience. There were thousands of devotees all around in the city. As soon as I used to get free from the shoot, I used to explore the city. I purchased many beautiful Banarasi saris for myself. Aur jab aap Varanasi main ho toh wahan ka maghai paan aur chaat kaise miss kar sakte hain. We visited Lucknow also and I really loved the place. We also went to Agra for the promotions and seeing the Taj Mahal was a wonderful experience. However, owing to professional obligations I did not get much time to spend in UP. But I really want to come here again for a long vacation."
