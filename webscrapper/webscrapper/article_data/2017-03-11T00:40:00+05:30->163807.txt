Panaji: The   Party (GFP) has questioned the state government over its decision to renew the licence of the sixth off-shore casino vessel in River Mandovi. 

 The state government had recently approved a conditional renewal to the licence of the off-shore casino belonging to Golden Globe Hotels Private Ltd (GGHPL) after the high court of Bombay at Goa, on Wednesday, issued a direction to consider the application filed by GGHPL, seeking renewal of its licence.
 
 Party president Prabhakar Timble, on Friday, said that the state government is putting the onus of renewing the licence on the high court which is not incorrect. 
 
 “The direction of the high court was to decide on the issue of casino licence as the government has accepted the fees from the casino operator and this stops the government to procrastinate indefinitely. Nowhere, the court has instructed the government to grant the licence,” Timble said, adding that the government had all other options except to keep the issue undecided. 
 
 The party attacked the state government over chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar’s comments that they had obeyed the directives of the high court, terming it misleading.
 
 “Pleading helplessness indicates that the government, in collusion with the casino operator, had predetermined the design and dirty trick for grant of the licence,” he said.
