 “I want to try and dabble in new genres of cinema and introduce innovative concepts and talented young filmmakers to the industry, by giving them a platform to prove their mettle,” says the producer who is presently working on another interesting film, Gudachari. 
 Adivi Sesh and   are playing in pivotal roles in the movie set to hit the screens in July.
