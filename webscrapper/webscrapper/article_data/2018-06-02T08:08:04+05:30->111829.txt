LUCKNOW: If you are a fasting Muslim who is out shopping in Aminabad, you need not rush back home for iftar. 

 Several shop-owners in the market have made arrangements to organise iftar for rozedaars shopping in their vicinity as the market is often crowded and shoppers and commuters get delayed for iftar. At a time, there are arrangements for about 50 people to open their fast at iftar in the middle of the market. 
 
 Sabir Khan, the owner of Chikan Corner, is among the many   who set up tables on the road to facilitate the tradition.
 
 "My father has made it into a custom to serve iftar to shoppers and others who come this way. It has been going on for six years now. The   is made at our house and we serve it on all 30 days of  . There is water, dates, sharbat, fruit and pakaodas. It's a noble cause of providing rozedaars with food and water, even if it is a morsel," said Khan.
 
 A similar 'open house' was seen at Nami Chikan. Owner Saeed Hasan said, "Often, shoppers feel hesitant as they think they might be charged for this iftar. But, it is for free. We try to provide everyone with something to drink or eat. They don't necessarily have to be our customers or even Muslim."
 
 Many shoppers were happy to have stumbled across this tradition and were relieved to have a glass of water after their long fast. 
 
 Irfana Farhan said, "We were supposed to reach home for iftar but due to the rush and traffic, we are stuck here. Passing by, I saw stalls set up and realised this was for iftar and my son and I stopped."
 
 Another shopper, Razia Begum from Nishatganj, said, "My sister and I came here to shop for clothes and while shopping, we got to know about the open iftar tradition. We were relieved to have iftar at the right time."
