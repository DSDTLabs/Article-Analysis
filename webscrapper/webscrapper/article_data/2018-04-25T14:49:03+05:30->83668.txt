TRICHY: A fast track Mahila Court in Thanjavur district sentenced a 50-year-old painter to four life imprisonment for raping and impregnating his minor daughter on Tuesday.

 According to the prosecution, the accused Subramanian of Sivakollai near Pattukottai in the district was a painter. His wife S Revathi was a daily wager and they had a 17-year-old daughter with learning disabilities. Leaving her daughter at home, Revathi had gone to   temple in   district two years ago. Her husband Subramanian was also at home that day.
 
 Using the opportunity, Subramanian had raped his then 15-year-old daughter and also threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed anything about the incident. Scared, the girl did not open up to her mother.
 
 On March 27, 2017, the girl developed stomach pain and was rushed to a hospital where doctors informed her mother that she was nine-months pregnant. The girl gave birth to the baby the same day. It came to light that Subramanian was responsible and subsequently Revathi lodged a complaint with Pattukottai police, who arrested Subramanian. 
 
 On hearing the case, the Mahila Court Judge Balakrishnan pronounced Subramanian guilty and sentenced him to four life imprisonment on Tuesday. The judge also awarded six month jail term for threatening to her daughter. The judge stated that the accused should undergo rigorous imprisonment until his death.
