CHENNAI: Former   Congress Committee president   has warned BJP national secretary   that the latter's   may lead to a situation where he "cannot move around freely in Tamil Nadu". 

 Speaking to reporters in Trichy on Sunday, Elangovan said Raja was unable to "control his tongue".
 
 Raja has been in the news lately for his controversial comments against P Ayyakannu, who led the recent protests by TN farmers in New Delhi.
 
 Earlier this month, he had called Ayyakannu a "fraud" and alleged that he had "taken money from the bank and not paid it back". On Friday, Raja, in a tweet, alleged that there was a "connection between Ayyakannu camp and   camp" which "has to be investigated and exposed".
 
 BJP state president Tamilisai Soundararajan on Saturday also wondered if there was a "ulterior motive" behind the farmers protest. 
 
 She wondered why Ayyakannu, after returning to the state, had not yet met chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami to ask him about how the state government would solve the farmers problems on loan waiver and interlinking of rivers.
 
 Instead, she said, the farmer leader met DMK working president MK Stalin and thanked him for the April 25 bandh in support of the farmers' issues, and alleged DMK's hand in the farmers' protest.
