GURUGRAM: The price of   has been increased by Re 1 per kg while that of piped cooking gas has been raised by Rs 1.25 per standard cubic metre (scm), after the government revised the input natural gas rates upwards.

 The new CNG and   prices are Rs 47.75/kg and Rs. 27.75/scm, respectively.
 
 The new prices, which came into effect from Tuesday morning, would affect around 20,000 city consumers who avail Piped Natural Gas (PNG) from Haryana City Gas Distribution Limited (HCGDL). Also, HCG has around 25 CNG stations across Gurugram for automobiles and the price   may eventually hit commuters as cab and auto drivers are most likely to pass on the burden to their passengers.
 
 “In view of the recent increase in the administered pricing mechanism (APM) by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, HCG has increased CNG and PNG prices with effect from 6am on April 3,” a handout from HCG read.
 
 A spokesperson for Haryana City Gas said, “We don’t provide cylinder services so the hike would only impact the PNG users. Also, from 6am today (Tuesday), all our CNG stations in Gurugram will sell the fuel as per the revised price.”
 
 “I don’t know about the hike yet. But if the fuel price has been increased, obviously we would want the company to charge more from passengers as well,” said Prakash, a driver from Pratapgarh, UP, who runs an app-based cab in NCR.
 
 Another can driver Mohsin, also from UP, echoed Prakash. “How can it be possible that we pay more for the fuel but the fares remain unchanged?”
 
 In fact, a lot of commuters have complained that cabs have already hiked the rates after the CNG prices were raised in Delhi and other parts of NCR a couple of days ago.
