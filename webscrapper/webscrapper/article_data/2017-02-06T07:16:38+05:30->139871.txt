They are repeating these offences time and again. We have data on which shop has committed what offence and the names of owners who got away by paying small fines.

Cops said that they noticed shop owners `sub-letting' these spaces to hawkers.
 
 “Much like how hawkers are being stopped from spilling onto the carriageway, we are going to draw a line within these corridors so that no encroachments take place,“ Ranganath said.
 
 He also pointed out that measures for smooth flow of traffic are being taken up on a trial basis.
 
 For instance, cops have not ruled out re-introducing restrictions on the movement of autorickshaws from Madina to  .“The   may require that the restrictions be in place,“ Ranganath said.
