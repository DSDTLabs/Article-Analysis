The countdown to  's action-drama ' ' has officially begun. The film that is scheduled to hit theatres on January 25, 2017, has been submitted to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), for certification and clearance.

 According to online reports, producer   submitted the film to the board three weeks in advance. However, due to a huge backlog of films to go through clearing, the film's viewing was delayed. A source claimed that there was no special treatment offered to Roshans and that their film had to queue up in line and wait its turn. Reportedly, the makers also did not 'pressurize' the members of the board to view their film on priority.
 
 'Kaabil' will be screened this week and will receive its certification and rating.
