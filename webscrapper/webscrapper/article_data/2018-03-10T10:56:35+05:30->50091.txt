RAJKOT: A class X girl fell unconscious after principal and trustee of   school in Rajkot allegedly pressurized her and her parents to pay outstanding fees to get the board exam admit card on Friday. The board exam begins from March 12.

 Dhara   fell unconscious in the school and was taken to government hospital. 
 
 According to Dhara’s mother  , the school authorities had pressurized them to pay the fees despite district education officer’s (DEO) order to collect fees of Rs 20,000 in four instalments. “After we paid first instalment of Rs 5,000, the school trustee insisted that we pay the remaining Rs 15,000 and threatened to withhold the exam admit card. My daughter, who is a topper in her class, got tensed and fell unconscious.” 
 
 As this news came, the   workers locked the school and forced school trustee to issue the hall ticket to the girl. NSUI president   alleged, “The school never follows the rules. We went to meet the DEO too, but as usual we got a standard reply that he would enquire into the matter.” 
 
 DEO M R Sagarka said, “I have sought an explanation from the school authority. They said they have handed over the hall ticket to the girl and that it was a pre-planned activity, which is their defence.”
