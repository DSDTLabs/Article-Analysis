BHARUCH/SURAT: The water level in   at   in   district on Saturday fell to 108.26 metres from 110.51 meters recorded on February 20.

 This is a precarious situation because during peak, the water level in the Sardar Sarovar Dam had just touched 127 meters this season, not its full capacity.
 
 For the first time, many small hills and trees in the catchment area of   in the upstream of Sardar Sarovar have become visible. People of Narmada and Bharuch districts say they had never seen the water level in Narmada river so shallow in the past 30 years. The inflow of water from   into the river is almost zero now.
 
 However, the state government officials say there is water shortage, but certainly no need for people to panic. They hope the monsoon situation will help them retrieve the grim situation on water front in the state.
