PATNA:   (PMC) is planning to develop at least eight new parking spaces in congested areas of the city.

 The corporation already has 51 parking lots in the state capital. A letter from the office of municipal commissioner Abhishek Singh has already been sent to the chief engineer to assess the situation of these spaces and make plans to develop parking lots there. 
 
 The parking spaces identified are all under over bridges, such as Bhikari Thakur railway over bridge, Mithapur over bridge, Mithapur over bridge near bus stand, Chiraiyatand railway over bridge near Kankarbagh Colony Mor, Chiraiyatand railway over bridge (east of Durga temple), Chiraiyatand railway over bridge (west of Durga temple), Bahadurpur over bridge near Munna chowk and Bahadurpur over bridge near Bahadurpur railway crossing. 
 
 PMC officials said these are perfect locations for parking zones as the basic arrangement is already present. “All we have to do is develop the area like marking the place, painting and cleaning the area. These locations have been identified as being overly congested. These zones will be ready in one or one-and-a-half-month period for use by the general public.” the municipal commissioner said on Thursday. 
 
 Manoj Singh, who resides near the Chiraiyatand railway over bridge, said, “Some part of the space under the over bridge has been encroached upon. People park haphazardly at times. I welcome this move of the PMC. It will also provide relief to us.”
