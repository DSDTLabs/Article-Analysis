PUNE: Traffic and legal experts say that a lack of deterrence and inadequate awareness about the implications of underage driving are some of the major causes for the rising menace.
Given the propensity of underage drivers to risky road behaviour like speeding, jumping signals, breaking lane discipline or driving without helmet, such riders are a danger to not only their own lives but also to the lives of other road users, they added.
 
 Traffic activist   stressed the need for starting a separate topic on traffic rules in schools for Stds I to IV students. “It has been observed that children listen to their teachers. If they were taught about traffic rules at school, in the future they will not break traffic rules,“ he said, while giving a parallel of initiatives in schools relating to bursting of fire crackers during   festival, which showed a positive effect.
 
 Others added that minor children should be taught the implications of underage driving and how it would affect the victim or offender and their families.
 
 Rajendra Sidhaye, Chairman of Save   Movement, said that the government must develop better public transport to discourage the use of two-wheelers, espe cially by minors. He added, “Our organisation has already started creating awareness among schoolchildren about traffic rules.“
 
 School teachers and parents must lead by example, said some like the father of a 15-year-old from  .
 
 “I did not know when my son started riding my motorcycle. I was shocked when I saw it. I told him that for the next three years he would not able to ride any vehicle. He will have to only use public transport“.
 
 Many activists have said that parents must stop under-16 students who drive to their school or tuition classes from even entering the premises if they are on a vehicle.
