PATIALA: A case was   against two  after obscene   a 10-yearold girl went viral in April.The father of the girl had taken the matter to police nearly a month ago but policemen insisted on first ascertaining that the matter merited registration of a case.

 Failing to zero in on the perpetrators of the crime, the Nabha police registered a case on Thursday against two different WhatsApp groups.
 
 Father of the 10-year-old was shocked to receive two videos of his daughter from two different WhatsApp groups, in which the girl is seen in an objectionable position with a man who is naked below the waist.
 
 The father approached the police with a complaint on April 18. The case was registered only on Thursday under Section 354 C (watching, or capturing image of a woman engaging in a private act) of the IPC, Section 11 (sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children From  , 2012 (POCSO) Act and Section 66 (intentionally or knowingly captures, publishes or transmits the image of a private area of any person) and 67 (publishing of information which is obscene in electronic form) of the IT Act at Kotwali police station in Nabha.
 
 The father also provided police two mobile numbers from which the videos were apparently uploaded. The WhatsApp groups against whom the FIR has been lodged go by the names ` Atti Shaitan' and `Gabir Log'. Police however said they were yet to identify the accused. Later, name of one Bunty was added to the FIR. SHO of Kotwali police station Nabha Karnail Singh was elusive when TOI broached the matter. He said this was a sensitive case and details of the investigation could not be divulged. DSP   said the accused would soon be identified.
 
 The father said he had no notion when the videos were made. “There are over 30 members in each of the groups and I don't know any of them,“ he said.
