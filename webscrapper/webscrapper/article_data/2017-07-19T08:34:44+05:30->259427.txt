AHMEDABAD: A 26-year old youth, a  , was arrested by a team of Ahmedabad rural police’s   (LCB) for involvement in stealing batteries from   at 21 locations in Gujarat. Investigators said that when Manish Vaishnav was arrested from Punjab and brought to the city, it was the first time he set foot in Gujarat.

 Investigators said that Manish used technology to remain behind the scene and yet get money from ‘sale’ of the batteries. Vaishnav is accused of thefts from Ahmedabad, Rajkot, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Surendranagar, Banaskantha and Patan over the last six months
 
 LCB officials said a battery was stolen at Jakhwada village near Viramgam in June. A scrap dealer was arrested and he told investigators that he took the battery, worth Rs 24,000, from outside the tower according to the instructions of a company official. 
 
 “The incident provided a link to Manish, a native of Kota, the alleged mastermind behind multiple such thefts. Catching him was difficult, as he used multiple phone numbers. We got concrete information about his presence in Patiala and sent a team led by sub-inspector Satish Ramani there,” said an LCB official.
 
 On Vaishnav’s modus operandi, investigators said he had worked as a mobile tower installation technician in Rajasthan and UP and knew the trade’s intricacies and the value of batteries for scrap dealers. He had insiders in installation companies, through whom he learned about replacement of batteries at specific towers. “He then got the number of the tower and the supervisor’s name off the internet and found the nearest scrap dealer. He would impersonate the tower company official and invite the dealer ‘buy’ the batteries kept near the tower. The dealer would take the batteries and transfer the funds to Vaishnav’s account. He thus committed the crimes without even visiting the scene,” said an investigator.
