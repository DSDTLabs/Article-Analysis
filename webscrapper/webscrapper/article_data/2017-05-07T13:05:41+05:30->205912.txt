GUWAHATI: The Assam Pradesh   Committee ( ) called on President Pranab Mukherjee and Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday, seeking the Centre's intervention in implementing  . 

 The APCC delegation, led by its president Ripun   and comprising Congress MLAs and MPs, said they requested the President and the home minister to ensure the cut-off date for identifying illegal migrants remains March 25, 1971. Several indigenous organizations have been demanding that the cut-off date be 1951.
 
 "We have requested the President. There will be chaos in Assam if the cut-off date were to be changed. March 25, 1971 has been accepted by everybody and must be retained. The Centre must protect the Assam Accord in the Supreme Court," Bora told TOI from New Delhi on Saturday. "The President has assured us he will look into the matter," he added.
 
 Bora said that another agenda is to put pressure on the centre to get the NRC update process complete as soon as possible. "The NRC is the only solution to protect the people of the state from the outsiders. The Centre should put up a strong fight in the SC to legalize the panchayat secretary's certificate in the NRC. Otherwise, more than 40 lakh women would suffer," he added.
