GURGAON: The two   troopers, whose alleged role in the   scam is being investigated by the special investigation team (SIT), were suspected to be very close to suspended inspector Jasmer Singh, former in-charge of arms licence branch. The CRPF personnel, according to police, are national-level shooters. The SIT has already sought the custody of Jasmer to reinterrogate him. 

 Sources said every aspect of the case is being closely examined by SIT, which suspects the accused’s role in smuggling pistols and guns used in sporting events. The CRPF troopers — Nale Amol Bhagwan and MN Rahman — are posted as constables at the paramilitary force’s shooting range in Kadarpur, have been part of many tournaments and won several medals. The SIT, according to sources, has already sent notices to Bhagwan and Rahman, asking them to join the investigation.
 
 An SIT officer, who is privy to the probe, said inspector Jasmer is fond of shooting and known to the CRPF troopers. They had purportedly re-registered their arms licences when Jasmer was working in the arms licence branch in Gurgaon.
 
 “To inquire actual role of the CRPF shooters, interrogation of inspector Jasmer is required. We have already moved the court seeking his production warrant. We hope that court will issue the production warrant tomorrow (Saturday) and we will question him,” said ACP Anil Yadav, head of SIT told TOI.
 
 SIT has also sent the final notice to constable Mahesh asking him to join the investigation.
