 The Commando 2 team – Vidyut,  , director Deven Bhojani and producer   – was taken directly to the boxing ground of the camp, where the CISF officials demonstrated their combat skills. They even did flying push-ups and back clap push-ups for the film's team. Vidyut also joined in and did 30 push-ups with them. He said, "Whenever I meet CISF jawans at airports and they ask me for a pic, I leave everything to get clicked with them. We tried to show action in the film but it doesn't match up to what you guys do in real life. It was our responsibility to make a film which is authentic. I apologise for having long hair in the film. Mera bas chalta toh main bhi aapki tarah chhote rakhta." The CISF officials also showed Adah a few self-defence techniques.

  About the team's visit, VS Mann, DIG, CISF (SSG), said, "They contacted us on Monday evening. We are used to organising functions at a short notice, so it was not a problem for us. This was the first time that a film’s team visited our camp. We agreed to the visit because people should know what life is like in these camps. The interaction was interesting for our jawans as well."
