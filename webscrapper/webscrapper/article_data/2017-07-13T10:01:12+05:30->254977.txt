NEW DELHI: In a bid to educate 15 to 17-year-old ‘future voters’, who can vote when they turn 18, the   is planning to organise a pan-India quiz competition on elections and the electoral process.
 
  The quiz competition will run across government-run secondary schools. While the EC has already rolled out a month-long registration drive to get young voters between 18 and 21 on board, officials at the Commission said that the quiz is part of the EC’s initiative to drive awareness and literacy at the school level so that young voters feel encouraged to exercise their votes.
  
  A brainchild of former Chief Election Commissioner  , the quiz competition will be carried out at the district, state and zone levels by the state election commissions.
  
  The final will eventually be televised on Doordarshan, before National Voters’ Day in January next. Zaidi had also written to HRD minister   in July last year to introduce ‘electoral literacy’ in the curriculum at the secondary school level.
  
  Officials at the EC said that the initiative was important as many democracies across the world have ‘electoral literacy’ as part of their school curriculum.
  
  According to figures provided by the Election Commission, there are more than 30 million (or three crore) young adults who are eligible to vote but have not enrolled themselves for voter identity cards. During the recent assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, nearly 75 lakh voters were left behind.
