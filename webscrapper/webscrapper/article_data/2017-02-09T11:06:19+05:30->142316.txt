GUWAHATI: Police found a   of the   lying on the road at the   here on Wednesday, triggering concerns about the conduct of the exams. The   exam is set to begin on February 20. 

 The council, however, said the incident will not affect the exam schedule. "The answer scripts were being brought directly from the press and was not that confidential," council chairman NM Hussain told TOI on Wednesday. 
 
 "Around 20 lakh answer scripts are being brought to   from outside the state for the Class XII board exam. Unexpectedly, one bundle was missing from the truck carrying the answer scripts. Police are looking into the matter," Hussain said. The bundle that was lost from the truck contained as many as 937 answer scripts. Extra care will be taken to ensure smooth conduct of the exam, for which 2.5 lakh candidates are appearing this year, he added.
 
 Sources in the state education department said the government has taken up the matter seriously since controversies surrounding the board exams have gripped the council in successive years, putting the state education department in the dock time and again. "The answer scripts are being carried to Guwahati from Kolkata in trucks. Only the additional sheets required in the exams will be bought from local sources. If more bundles have been lost on the way, it can create a mess during the exams. Police is likely to probe the matter in depth," the source added. 
 
 Last year, the council drew flak from examinees and guardians over the leakage of question papers, that led to the postponement of the physics and biology papers.
