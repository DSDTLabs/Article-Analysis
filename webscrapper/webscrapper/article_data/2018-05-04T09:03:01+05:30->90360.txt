PATNA: A day after former Bihar assembly speaker   left JD (U) citing rise in communal clashes, attack on dalits and neglect of devoted workers, former state president of party’s youth wing,  , announced his decision to quit the party on Thursday.

 Kushwaha cited “collapse” of democratic setup in the party for his decision. “No democracy is left in JD (U). Old-timers are being ignored and industrialists are being sent to the legislative council. People like me devoted our entire lives for the party by working at the grassroots level, but there is no space for us,” Kushwaha told TOI.
 
 Kushwaha was removed from the position of state president of JD (U)’s   (youth cell) in April.
 
 Kushwaha accused the party’s general secretary, R C P Singh, of running the show based on favouritism. “Singh, a former officer, is handling the party and those favoured by him are well positioned in the party,”Kushwaha said.
 
 JD (U), on the other hand, termed Kushwaha’s decision to quit the party as “insignificant”. “Four Congress MLCs, including former Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Choudhary recently joined the JD (U). Many other senior opposition netas will join the party soon,” JD (U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.
 
 Political observers said Chouhdary felt alienated in the party after former education minister and dalit leader Ashok Choudhary joined the JD (U).
 
 Meanwhile, deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Thursday launched a scathing attack on former   MP  , who has decided to launch his own party. “Sharad is supporting the party which has Lalu Prasad as its president. He is supporting a party whose president is convicted in multi-crore fodder scam. Is this the way of protecting democratic setup of the country?” SuMo asked.
