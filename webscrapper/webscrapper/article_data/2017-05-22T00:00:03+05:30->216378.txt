 The bonhomie they share has been apparent in all their social media interactions. They might not be contemporaries, but their friends’ circle is what has got   and   to hang out together. Their equation is much talked about, but are these two BFFs or not? This is what the first episode of Akul Balaji’s latest show Super Talk Time will reveal. Sources tell us that the programme will see the two girls indulge in some fun banter, games and even tell-all talk. “Rakshitha is crazy, just like me. That is the reason we get along so well. The show will be a testimony to our madness,” shares Ragini. Akul meanwhile adds that unlike regular TV shows, this will not dwell on a person’s past, or his highs and lows. “This show is only about light-hearted talk and ensuring the guests indulge in a good time while they also answer some masala questions. On the guest list will be co stars, best friends, boyfriends and girlfriends and other such exciting combos. It is a different experience for me too, as I make a detour from regular reality TV hosting,” signs off Akul.
  
  Rakshitha talks about Ramya: We hear that Rakshitha has spoken about her contemporary and rival Ramya on the show and we know when Rakshitha speaks, it is no holds barred.
