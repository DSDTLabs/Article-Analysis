The   high court on Monday questioned the need for 12 police officers in the DGP rank in the state and asked if their appointment was made as per law.

 The single bench's criticism came on a petition filed by opposition leader   questioning the case over the   government decision to promote N   as DGP.
 
 Chennithala's counsel said the government had not yet appointed a vigilance director. The government counsel submitted that four IPS officers were promoted as DGPs as per cadre rules based on their qualification and experience.
