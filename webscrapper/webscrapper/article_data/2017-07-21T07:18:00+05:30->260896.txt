New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thurday granted bail for 14 days to a former Congress councillor serving life term in a 1984 anti-Sikh riots case to enable him to sell his property and arrange funds to pay his lawyers.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Anu Malhotra released Balwan Khokhar on bail on the condition that he will neither leave the national capital nor try to contact or influence the witnesses in the case. Congress leader Sajjan Kumar had been acquitted in this riots case by the trial court but Khokhar was convicted along with four others. The bench granted Khokhar the relief, subject to his furnishing a bail bond of Rs 25,000 with one surety of the like amount.
 
 The court, however, rejected the additional ground -- medical treatment of the various ailments he is suffering from -- on which he had sought bail. The bench said there is no need to release him on medical grounds as the jail authorities are taking care of his medical needs.
 
 His plea was opposed by the CBI which said complaints have been received that he had tried to pressurise witnesses in the past by contacting their relatives. The agency also said that the bail plea did not give details of the property to be sold. 
 
 Thereafter, Khokhar's lawyer provided the property details and the bench granted him bail for two weeks. Arguments were also concluded on behalf of Khokhar in his appeal challenging his conviction and sentence.
