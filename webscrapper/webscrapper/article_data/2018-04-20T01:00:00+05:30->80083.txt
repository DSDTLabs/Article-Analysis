 Confirming the incident of mass food poisoning, district magistrate Abhishek Singh said prima facie it was a case of eating ‘stale’ sweets. Asked about the possibility of adulterated ingredients used in food preparation, the DM said the possibility cannot be ruled out, and as such, he has ordered preservation of the food sample and its subsequent lab testing.
 
 Singh added that adequate number of ambulances were immediately dispatched to the village to transport the ill as soon as report of food poisoning, reached the district headquarters. The DM along with SSP Garima Malik visited the ANMMCH and instructions were issued to the hospital authorities for proper care and treatment.
 
 Reports reaching the district headquarters said the food was made early and served late on account of delayed arrival of the marriage party. According to hospital superintendent Dr SK Sinha, all patients are out of danger and those shifted to the ICU were sent there for extra care.
 
 The DM added that an advisory would soon be issued to event managers and marriage party hosts for preparation and preservation of food for mass intake.
