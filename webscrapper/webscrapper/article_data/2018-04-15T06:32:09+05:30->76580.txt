KOLKATA: A 23-year-old woman from Tiljala, who went to   to meet a friend, died on Saturday morning after she fell in an open lift shaft.

 According to police, Sadaf Ariff was returning home when she fell in the shaft of the building on Ibbrahim Road in Ekbalpore.
 
 “She was on the second floor when she stepped into the open lift shaft in this newly constructed house. Some repairs were being carried out in the lift. She suffered grievous injuries. Her friends and other relatives rushed her to   where Ariff breathed her last a few hours later on Saturday,”said an investigating officer.
 
 DC (Port)   said, “Prima facie, this looks like an accident. We are going to get the post-mortem details before we arrive at a conclusion. So far, we are yet to get any complaint from the victim’s family.”
 
 Police sources said the victim’s friend and others who rushed out to help Ariff are being questioned. “We shall find out if a sign was put up to warn people about the repairs. A case of unnatural death has been registered at the Ekbalpore police station,” Raza said.
 
 A senior officer from the building department of Kolkata Municipal Corporation said they will visit the spot soon. “If we find any illegal construction work or any negligence, we shall take legal action,” he said.
 
 Kolkata witnessed at least two similar deaths earlier this year. On March 28, 54-year-old carpenter   who worked in government installations, was found dead in a lift shaft. Police said he fell into the lift shaft while trying to urinate from the eighth floor of an under-construction building on Ballygunge Circular Road. In January, an “illegal” construction project on Watgunge Road near Hastings was wound up after its supervisor fell to his death in the elevator shaft.
