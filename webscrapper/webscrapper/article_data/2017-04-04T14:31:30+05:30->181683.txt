Mumbai: Implementation of the controversial pay-and-park policy will make the city’s richest municipal corporation richer. 

 The   would earn Rs 1.1 crore monthly from revised parking charges at 18 south Mumbai parking lots—a 100% jump from Rs 49.65 lakh so far, said sources. 
 
 On Monday, the   began to put up boards announcing revised parking charges of Rs 60 an hour. However, this development did not go down well with parties in the BMC. Pandemonium broke out in the civic house as party leaders sought clarification from the civic administration on why they were not kept in the loop about implementation of the policy. 
 
 Anil Kokil,   corporator and BEST chairman, said the civic house should have been informed about the decision. Yashwant Jadhav, Sena leader in the BMC, said the administration should explain how the policy would prove beneficial to the civic body.
 
 BJP, Sena’s former alliance partner in the BMC, emphasized that the civic house should have been taken into confidence so that fresh suggestions could be incorporated, as the policy was passed almost two years ago. “The policy is yet to be implemented in residential areas and if residents oppose it, we will support them,” said Manoj Kotak, BJP leader in the BMC. 
 
 Ravi Raja, Congress leader in the BMC, said, “We demand that the policy be reopened.”
