BENGALURU: The   leadership may field new faces in assembly constituencies where it is on a weak wicket, to woo young voters.

 Dropping broad hints,   B S Yeddyurappa said there is no space for new faces in constituencies where the party is strong, but winnable new faces would be preferred in constituencies where it is weak.
 
 “We are going to look at winnability, and give tickets to leaders who are already established in the constituencies,” he said. The BJP is on a shaky wicket in several seats across Old Mysuru, Tumakuru, Kolar, Chikkaballapura, Ramanagara and Bengaluru Rural.
 
 Though the BJP national leadership will have a final say in selection, Yeddyurappa said potential candidates have been informally asked to work towards this goal. “I should admit that Shah will have the final word, but we have already identified the candidates and asked them to work towards achieving our target of 150-plus seats,” he added.
 
 Party sources said that in constituencies where the going may be rough, kin of top-rung leaders have been inducted into the BJP Yuva Morcha to ensure they get tickets.
 
 Arun Somanna (MLC V Somanna’s son), Umesh Karjol (MLA Govind Karjol’s son), Tejasvi Surya (MLA Ravi Subramanya’s nephew), Harshavardhan (V Sreenivas Prasad's son-in-law) and former minister B N Bacche Gowda’s son have joined the Yuva Morcha to contest from non-BJP citadels.
 
 This apart, several Yuva Morcha office-bearers have also got a leg-up and are lobbying for tickets, including state general secretary  , state secretary   and others. “We are hoping that our work will be recognized by Shah and we will make it to the final list,” said one aspirant.
 
 BJP national president Amit Shah’s address at Holalkere was clear on “mere jigar ke tukde” or “a beloved part of the heart”: that the saffron party will bank on the youth to bring them to power in 2018.
