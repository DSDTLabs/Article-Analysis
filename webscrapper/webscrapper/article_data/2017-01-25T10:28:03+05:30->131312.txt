INDORE : A list of six more witnesses was submitted before the local court by the prosecution in Kavita Raina   on Tuesday, on which arguments were made and the decision was reserved. 

 This list of additional witnesses includes telecom company nodal officer, the then SDM, another police official and three persons who had lodged FIR against accused   in the previous case against him for selling pornographic CDs. 
 
 The application was contested by Bairagi's counsel   and OP Solanki, who claimed that the prosecution was unnecessarily tried to delay the trial, now that only two to three witnesses were left to be examined. Kavita was missing since August 24, 2015 and her body was found two days later in a nullah near  . 
 
 During investigation, police found Mahesh Bairagi, a saree shop owner, guilty of her murder as she resisted his sexual advances. TNN
