MUMBAI: BJP’s city unit chief Ashish Shelar said Yuva Sena’s Aaditya Thackeray was only interested in ‘rooftop parties’.

 “For him (Aaditya, son of   chief Uddhav Thackeray), the only issues remaining are late night shopping markets and rooftop parties. For us ( ), the issues of Mumbai are different and they are: better roads, clean drinking water and effective gutter system. Aaditya is identified only with night bazars and dancing at rooftop parties,” said Shelar.
 
 In his rallies for Sena candidates, Aaditya has been criticizing the estranged ally of his party. Sena and BJP are contesting the high-stake elections to the BMC, slated for February 21, separately. The counting of votes will be held on February 23.
 
 “Mumbaikars have not taken any note of Aaditya Thackeray. I doubt about his seriousness in taking up the Mumbai’s real issues,” Shelar said. 
 
 Responding to the allegations levelled against BJP member of parliament Kirit Somaiya by Sena leaders recently, Shelar said they are indicative of the Uddhav Thackeray-led party losing its ground.
 
 “Sena has raised new allegations against the BJP. First, they invited Hardik Patel as he is opposing the BJP. Sena is consistently trying to divert the attention of people from real issues and problems,” he added. A known Sena-baiter, Shelar has been firing salvos at the Sena leadership on the irregularities in the Sena-ruled BMC and the lack of transparency in administration. Relations between the two erstwhile allies are at an all-time low.
