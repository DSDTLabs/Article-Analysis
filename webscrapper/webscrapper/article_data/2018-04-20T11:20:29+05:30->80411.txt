CHANDIGARH: The characteristic ear-splitting crack of bikes without   may soon be a thing of the past, now that Punjab and Haryana   has taken note of the public nuisance. The court has directed Chandigarh district court to impose a fine of at least Rs 1,000 on violators, as prescribed under law. 

 The high court directed Chandigarh district court to deal with traffic violators sternly. The court said paltry fines of Rs 200 to Rs 300 would not be enough of a deterrent for offenders. 
 
 The ruling came on a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking stricter implementation of the rule banning modified   producing high-decibel noise. The case will now come up for hearing on May 22.
 
 During the case proceedings, Chandigarh police provided the names of repeat offenders in high court. Earlier, the high court observed that traffic violators should be taught a lesson and rules should be implemented strictly. 
 
 The court also asked the administration to act against people using loud music and horns. 
 
 During an earlier hearing, the Chandigarh administration informed the Punjab and Haryana high court that 315 challans have been issued to traffic rule violators for non-functional silencers and high volume music players till February 15, 2018.
 
 In this case, the petitioner, a Chandigarh resident, submitted before the high court that people are openly flouting traffic norms by getting silencers of their bikes removed and modified to produce a jarring noise which scares passers-by and causes noise pollution by producing a succession of unduly harsh, shrill, loud and alarming noises. 
 
 The petitioner has sought directions to the administration to take preventive measures by spreading awareness among residents on the use of modified bikes. Many bikers are unaware of the fact that alteration of a factory model bike is illegal under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
