CHENNAI: DakshinaChitra will be hosting an exhibition of photographs and writings by   at its Varija Gallery from July 29 July to August 30. 

 Sujatha is a writer and photographer with a background in design and art. 
 
 Titled “Lands through my lens: Journeys from Chicago to Chennai”, Sujatha’s   collections examine the man-made landscape and intersections with nature combining the written word and photography, said a release from DakshinaChitra.
 
 “Sujatha likes to tell the viewer or reader to look at unusual connections in everyday subjects, findings unexpected links and patterns that lead to renewed outlook. Her themes have been developed from her love for mythology,  , patterns, objects, nature, conservation and written word,” it said.
