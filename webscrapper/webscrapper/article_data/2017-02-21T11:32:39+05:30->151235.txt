ERODE: A bus attached with the  's ( ) Coimbatore division was confiscated at the   Bus Stand in Erode district on Monday for failing to pay compensation to an accident victim despite a court order. 

 The bus, plying between Coimbatore and Sathyamangalam, was confiscated when it reached Sathyamangalam Bus Stand. A legal officer, along with the petitioner, arrived at the bus stand and attached the vehicle, as the transport department failed to comply with the court order to pay compensation to B Dhanabakkiyam hailing from   in Sathyamangalam town.
 
 "My arm bones were broken in an accident when a government bus in which I was travelling in, met with an accident in 2012," Dhanabakkiyam said.
 
 The accident happened when the bus driver lost control over the vehicle when negotiating a turn on Ooty-Gudalore route in the Nilgiris district. The vehicle fell on its side, causing injury to Dhanabakkiyam's right hand. She had filed a case at the judicial magistrate court in Sathyamangalam sub-court against the transport corporation demanding compensation.
 
 In 2012, the court directed the transport corporation to pay a compensation of 4.14 lakh to the petitioner. However, the corporation failed to pay it. The petitioner again approached the court a couple of months ago and got an order to attach the bus. 
 
 "Now the TNSTC has to pay 4.14 lakh along with an interest," a court official said. 
 
 TNSTC officials at the bus stand said that there are several similar cases pending in courts and the corporation is trying to pay compensation. 
 
 "We will try our best to pay the compensation to the victims at the earliest," an official said.
