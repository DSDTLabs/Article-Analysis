COIMBATORE: Mounting a strident attack on the state police for failing to prevent violence targeted at leaders of the  , state party chief   said that soon 'Ram rajya' would bloom in Tamil Nadu. 

 Leading a protest on Friday evening in Coimbatore to condemn the attacks on BJP functionaries, Tamilisai Soundarajan alleged that the police have not arrested the real culprits behind the petrol bomb attack on BJP office in the city as well as torching of party district president Nandakumar's car a few days ago.
 
 Upping the ante, Tamilisai said if there were even a single attack more on BJP men, the perpetrators have to face the consequences. In a remark, that is seen as a veiled attack on the ruling AIADMK, Tamilisai asked 'when "paavigal" (sinners) can rule the state, why not "kaavigal" (saffron clad person) rule?'' "We will not stop until we capture power in the state,'' she said.
 
 She alleged Coimbatore was fast turning into a haven for extremists and blamed the police for turning a blind eye to the threat. "There is no security for BJP functionaries. If police failed to contain the violence perpetrated against BJP leaders, the party would not remain a mute spectator,'' she warned in her speech, laced with caustic remarks against the police. Flanked by BJP leaders C P Radhakrishnan, S R Sekar and Vanathi Srinivasan, she told the BJP functionaries.
 
 Daring those who hurled petrol bombs to come out in the open and show their faces, Tamilisai said any number of bombs would not stop the BJP from achieving their goal of 'Ram rajya'. "Henceforth no one can stop us from taking Ganesh Chaturthi processions through any street. Neither the government nor the police can stop us,'' she said.
 
 Hitting out at DMK working president M K   for objecting the rath yatra, she said Stalin was scared of BJP's growing influence in Tamil Nadu.
