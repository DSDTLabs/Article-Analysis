CHENNAI: Police on Friday arrested three men who carjacked a medico from Turkey and drove away with his  . 

 Investigators said they apprehended  , 44, a former   functionary, Chowdary, 45, and Babu, 30, of  , for the crime.
 
 The trio, involved in similar offences earlier, decided to steal the car after Turkish national Emre Ince, an MBBS student at a medical college in Senneerkuppam near  , put up an online advertisement.
 
 "Ince had used the Mercedes Benz for a few years and wanted to sell the car," an officer said. "He did not know a trustworthy broker so he thought he'd put up an online ad and bargain for the best price he could get."
 
 Ince on Wednesday received a call from Basheer, who said he saw the ad and was ready to make an offer for the car. Basheer asked Ince to meet him in a Valasaravakkam hotel.
 
 Basheer pretended to strike a deal with Ince when the two other members of the gang entered the room. They brandished a knife and Ince tried to raise an alarm. But the gang threatened him into silence, grabbed the car keys and the money that he was carrying and fled.
 
 A shaken Ince did not contact the city police. He approached the consulate general of Turkey in Chennai on Thursday and officials there alerted the Valasaravakkam police.
 
 Investigators arrested the gang members through security television camera footage from the crime scene. They led police officers to a friend's house on the outskirts where they had left the car.
 
 The gang confessed to an earlier carjacking - of a Volkswagen from a man who lived in Vanniyambadi.
