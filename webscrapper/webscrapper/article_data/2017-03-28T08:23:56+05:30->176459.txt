PUNE: A couple's attempt to avoid theft of their valuables when they were out of station, backfired on a   (PMPML) bus on Sunday afternoon. 

 Fearing that thieves will steal jewellery from their house, the couple decided to carry the valuables with them only to lose them to thieves on a crowded PMPML bus.
 
 The incident occurred between Swargate and   around 1.30pm. The couple   (27) and her husband, a private bank employee, lost jewellery and cash worth Rs 2.50 lakh.
 
 Pawar later lodged a complaint with the Shivajinagar police station. Police have booked unidentified passenger(s) for the alleged theft. Pawar told TOI that she and her husband had decided to visit their native Shrirampur in Ahmednagar district to celebrate Gudi Padwa. "We stay in Satara. Afraid our house would get burgled in our absence, we decided to carry the jewellery with us," she said.
