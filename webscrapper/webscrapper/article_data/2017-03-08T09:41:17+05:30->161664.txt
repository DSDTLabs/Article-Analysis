CHENNAI: The release of Apollo Hospitals and AIIMS reports on Jayalalithaa’s treatment and subsequent death has not satisfied the AIADMK faction headed by former chief minister   which has decided to go ahead with their   across the state on Wednesday seeking a judicial probe. 

 Party MLAs and MPs will be fasting in Chennai and other districts with Panneerselvam leading the fast from Rajarathinam Stadium at Egmore from 9am to 5pm. “Our leader will sit on fast at 9am and at the same time our supporters will also commence the fast,” said former school education minister K Pandiarajan speaking to media at   residence. “We are not satisfied with the reports submitted by Apollo Hospitals and AIIMS as there are discrepancies between the two. We want a judicial probe to bring out the truth in Amma’s treatment and her death,” said Pandiarajan. 
 
 Meanwhile, opposition parties also pointed out anomalies in the reports released by government on Monday. Speaking to reporters at Kolathur on Tuesday, DMK working president M K   said, “On September 25, Apollo Hospitals released a medical bulletin stating that Jayalalithaa was admitted there following fever and nutrition deficiency. It said she would be in hospital for a few days and would go back to her residence. But the AIIMS statement states that Jayalalithaa was unconscious and on life support when she was admitted to hospital on September 22.” 
 
 PMK founder Dr S Ramadoss said people wanted to know how a person who was seriously ill could affix her thumb impression on the nomination papers of party candidates for three byelections.
