NEW DELHI: Taking a humane approach to the jailed gangster Neeraj Sherawat alias Neeraj  , currently lodged in solitary confinement, a special   directed jail administration to   him to a separate   immediately. 

 “It is a matter of common knowledge that complete and constant isolation of a prisoner may lead his mind to total insanity and it can actively cause disaster to his physical and mental health...,” said special judge Tarun Sahrawat. 
 
 The jail administration was, therefore, directed to shift the accused from this   confinement to some other secured ward so that he could share company with other co-prisoners.
 
 Bawana, through his counsel MS Khan, moved court pointing out his solitary confinement since October, 2017. Khan also argued that his client was suffering from psychological issues. Appearing for the jail authority, the law officer said it was the requirement of law to keep dangerous prisoners in the high security ward. The court, however, noted, “The order does not mention anywhere that he is a dangerous prisoner, prone to escape…”
