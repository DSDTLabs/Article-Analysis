AHMEDABAD: The wait for state government-allotted   has become a little longer because   was not able to sign on the draft for the housing policy prepared to be placed before Gujarat high court.

 On August 30, the high court had set a deadline of two weeks for the government to place on record the   to government employees according to its promise made in December last year. However, the state government sought more time from the court on the ground that the chief minister was too busy during the visit of dignitaries – Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe. The formalities could not be completed and hence the policy decision could only be placed before the court next week, the state government.
 
 The high court has now extended the deadline for this till September 21, sources said. Meanwhile, the high court registry has sent a list of 429 employees – 402 high court employees and 27 employees of the government pleader’s office – to the district collector to initiate the process of granting land to them.
