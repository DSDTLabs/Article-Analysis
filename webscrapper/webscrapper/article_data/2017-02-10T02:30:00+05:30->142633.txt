Hyderabad: City-based pharma major Aurobindo Pharma Limited on Thursday announced that it has forayed into the development of biosimilars with the acquisition of four cell culture derived biosimilar products from Swiss player TL Biopharmaceutical AG.

 Aurobindo said the transaction is a strategic investment for future growth and will position it as a strong player in the rapidly evolving biosimilars landscape.
 
 “This acquisition is in line with our strategy of investing in complex products and is an important first step towards establishing Aurobindo’s global biosimilars portfolio,” Aurobindo Pharma Limited managing director N Govindarajan explained.
 
 As part of the agreement, TL Biopharmaceutical will supply all the developmental data for four molecules and Aurobindo and its affiliates will develop, commercialize and market these products globally. 
 
 “The branded market size of these four biosimilars, three of which are monoclonal antibodies, in oncology is very promising. Regulatory filings for these products are intended in the 2020-22 period,” the company informed the bourses.
 
 The company said it is preparing to take its lead molecule from this transaction, a Bevacizumab biosimilar, for clinical trials in 2017. Bevacizumab is an anti-antiogenesis drug used in treating multiple-cancers including metastatic colon or rectal cancer, non-squamous and non-small cell lung cancers.
 
 “Building on these first four products licensed from TL, Aurobindo is expanding its diverse portfolio of eight more next wave of biosimilars, ensuring a strong and diverse products pipeline. Aurobindo has set up a fully functional R&D center for biologics development and is also establishing a state-of-art manufacturing facility in Hyderabad, Telangana which would be ready by Q2, FY 18,” said the generics and API manufacturer.
