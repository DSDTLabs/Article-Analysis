BENGALURU: Instead of students,   (Autonomous) on Sunday was packed with hundreds of  , all hoping to get a second chance to be back in the workplace.

 The Nightingales Jobs 60+  , organized by the Nightingale Empowerment Foundation (NEF) with St Joseph’s College, was open to financially weak but physically fit people, aged between 60 and 70.
 
 “The first 60+   was held in 2011, and since then the number of senior citizens participating in such events has increased,” said S Premkumar Raja, co-founder, Nightingales Medical Trust (NMT). The Rotary Club is keen on holding similar fairs in areas where it is active, he added. 
 
 The placements are in the areas of administration, supervision, public relations, teaching, accountancy, insurance and marketing, with an average monthly salary of Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000. Nearly 1,000 people registered for the daylong fair. Till date, over 2,300 seniors have been placed through the fairs.
 
 “I was a private school teacher for over 25 years and retired in 2015. I am a widow and get a monthly pension of Rs 500 from the school. I don’t want to depend on my children to pay my rent, so I thought I’d try to get another job,” said a 62-year-old woman. Most schools wanted young teachers, she rued.
 
 Pushpa N, 66, who is finding retirement life boring, is hoping to get back to work as soon as possible. “I worked with a bank for several years and retired in 2011. I don’t want to sit idle at home; I wish to utilize the knowledge I have gained after working for so many years,” she said.
