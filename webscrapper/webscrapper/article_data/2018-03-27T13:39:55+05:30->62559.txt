NAGPUR: A Bihar-based domestic help, identified as Ajit  , decamped with valuables worth Rs 2.87 lakh, including Rs 1 lakh cash, after locking up 56-year-old Parul   at her East Wardhaman Nagar home on Sunday. There was no one else at home when the theft took place. 

 It is learnt Thaker family had hired Kamat through a manpower company based in Delhi earlier this month. Kamat, whose identity on the Aadhaar card could be fake one, had joined work on March 16. He was engaged as a residential servant who also stayed in the same premises. 
 
 Police said Parul, whose husband   is an income tax practitioner, was engaged in prayer room. Kamat, who was cleaning the dining space, closed the prayer roomâ€™s door from outside. A stunned Parul asked him what he was up to and Kamat is learnt to have replied she would soon see. Before Parul could react, Kamat is learnt to have used a key to open an almirah and took away cash and valuables kept in it. 
 
 Parul broke the glass on the door and opened the latch outside before alerting other family members. The cops from Tehsil police were alerted too. The cops have now started a search for Kamat after registering an offence.
