NEW DELHI:   hit back at   for his remark against   and the party that they believed in “dynasty and appeasement” politics, saying the   chief should not forget about their own leaders who follow the practice.

 AICC spokesman Manish Tewari said: “Those who talk about dynasty, if they don’t believe in dynasty then why are Prem Kumar Dhumal’s son Anurag Thakur and Rajasthan chief minister Vansundhara Raje’s son Dushyant singh in Parliament. What are they doing in Lok Sabha?” “Chhattishgarh CM Raman Singh on whom there are charges of PDS scam, what is his son doing in Parliament.
 
 Before pointing fingers at others, BJP president should look inwards,” he added. Another party spokesman Randeep Surjewala said a “rattled” BJP chief and his partymen should shed their “fear and obsession” with Rahul Gandhi and answer questions.
 
 The opposition party slammed the BJP chief Amit Shah for attacking Gandhi over his criticism of the government during his visit abroad, saying the precedent for that had been set by Prime Minister   himself.
