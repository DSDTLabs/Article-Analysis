CHANDIGARH: A 30-year-old woman, who was arrested for running a racket involving honeytrapping people, managed to escape from the custody of Fatehabad police in the wee hours of Tuesday. Accused   gave the slip to three cops, including two policewomen, at Fatehabad police station on the pretext of going to the washroom.

 Rekha, two women constables identified as Kavita and   and head constable   have been booked in a case of jailbreak registered against them at the women police station of Fatehabad. The case has been registered on the complaint of inspector Bimla Devi, SHO of Fatehabad women police station. “Both women constables and male head constable have been put under suspension with immediate effect. At the same time, police parties are conducting raids to arrest Rekha. We are hopeful of arresting her by Thursday,” said SHO Bimla.
 
 According to information, on Monday evening Rekha was arrested in a case of extortion and other charges. She was booked on the complaint of few locals, who had fallen prey to her. After arrest, she was medically examined at 11.30pm and had come to the police station at midnight. Since there was no provision for a fan in the lock up, she was kept in a room and constables Kavita and Mishu were made to stay with her.
 
 “At 12.30am, she complained of uneasiness and asked cops for the washroom. Mishu took her there, where she asked Mishu to relieve herself. Meanwhile, she climbed over the toilet seat to gain access to the window and escaped from there,” said the SHO, who was the first to reach police station after the incident.
