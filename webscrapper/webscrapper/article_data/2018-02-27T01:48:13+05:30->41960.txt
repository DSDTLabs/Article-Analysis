Chennai: The Madras   on Monday ordered notice to chief minister   and his deputy O Panneerselvam on a plea moved by former MLA R Chinnasamy, a former secretary of Anna Trade Union, assailing his removal from the post.

 Justice C V Karthikeyan passed the interim order and posted the civil suit to March 2 for further hearing.
 
 According to the petitioner, he was appointed as the secretary of the trade union by the then   supremo J Jayalalithaa on January 21, 2009. Ever since he was discharging his duties judiciously. 
 
 However, to his shock, he was removed from the post on February 3 by the present party coordinators OPS and EPS. Claiming that the duo has no authority to remove him from the trade union post since only the general secretary of the party can do so, Chinnasamy has approached the high court to declare his removal as null and void.
