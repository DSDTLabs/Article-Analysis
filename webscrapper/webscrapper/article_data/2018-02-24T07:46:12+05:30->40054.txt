KOLKATA: The handover of   Hotel is slated to bring in a slew of changes in the coming months. While much of this is to do with restoration, addition of facilities and infrastructural upgrade, there will be some effect on human resources. Though the hotel currently runs with 29 staff members, there is a requirement of at least 60 employees.

 The new owners, the Oberoi family that runs the heritage Elgin group of hotels at Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Sikkim, have decided to train and recruit orphans raised in a city-based home to fill up the gap.
 
 Tim Grandage, a British social worker who set up Future Hope for destitute and orphaned kids in the city, was on the board of the Fairlawn Hotel. But now that there is a change of ownership from   to the Oberois, the board has become defunct. Grandage has resigned, but the new owners have entered into an understanding with him whereby inmates of his home who reach adulthood, can train at Fairlawn for a stipend.
 
 After completing the course, they will be absorbed if they like the work.
 
 Since all children of Future Hope get English education and are helped to graduate, they are the best candidates to consider for Fairlawn, felt the new hotel director,  . “They speak immaculate English and are decently groomed. Tim ensures that the backbone of their training is British. Naturally, they will fit our requirements at Fairlawn, where we mostly get foreign guests,” Oberoi said.
 
 The ratio that the new owners will follow is three employees per room. There are 18 rooms and some more facilities for which new employees will have to be recruited. “All the old employees have been retained, but some will retire soon. These positions will also have to be filled. The existing employees needed a bit of leadership and direction, which we are providing by working with them,” Oberoi added.
