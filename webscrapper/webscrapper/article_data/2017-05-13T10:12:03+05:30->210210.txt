COIMBATORE: The   has conducted a   of patients who availed themselves of the chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme (CMCHIS) for the past four years. Patients who who received insurance payouts of over Rs 4 lakh were specifically called for the meeting to review the success of the scheme across the western region, right from Krishnagiri to the Nilgiris. 

 CMCHIS nodal officers conducted a review meeting on Thursday for patients who had undergone high-end procedures under the scheme at the government hospital. Around 450 patients across seven districts attended the meeting and interacted with officials from United India Insurance and MD India insurance. 
 
 The officials specifically reviewed patients who have undergone renal transplants, cochlear transplants, stem cell therapy and liver transplants across the districts. “Most other procedures only invite a payout of Rs 1.5 lakh, but all the above require payouts between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 22 lakh,” said the Coimbatore nodal officer. 
 
 Except cochlear transplants, and very recently renal transplants, none of the other high-end procedures is performed in government hospitals. This leaves patients with no option, but to go to a private hospital. 
 
 “We basically want to understand the success rate of surgeries done under the scheme,” said the officer. The two-day review meeting is also likely to be attended by health secretary   on Friday.
 
 The CMCHIS scheme was first introduced by the DMK regime in 2009 as the “Kalaignar Insurance Scheme”, but it began covering almost all medical procedures in 2012 when the   began focusing on it. The scheme can be availed of by all families with an annual income of less than Rs 72,000 per annum. It gives a general coverage of Rs 1 lakh a year or Rs 1.5 lakh a year for specific ailments and procedures. This covers diagnostics and medicines prescribed for recovery also. So far, 17.63 lakh people across the state have benefitted from the scheme.
