IMPHAL: After successfully ending the   (UNC)-sponsored   of the state's  , the   government has now set its sights on resolving the   against three 'anti-migrant' bills in Churachandpur district. 

 Observers, who praised the BJP-led coalition government for achieving the blockade breakthrough, said peace and development would return to Manipur if the Churachandpur agitation ended.
 
 MLA of the constituency and BJP leader V Hangkhalian told TOI that he had approached the leaders of the Joint Action Committee (JAC) against Anti-Tribal Bills on Wednesday. 
 
 "The JAC leaders were very positive. They asked me for some time," said Hangkhalian.
 
 The Kuki-Chin-Mizo dominated district has been on the boil ever since the state assembly passed three bills to regulate the influx of 'outsiders' in the state on August 31, 2015.
 
 At least nine agitators were killed, six of them in police firing, during a violent protest against the three bills in Churachandpur. 
 
 The protesters said the bills were against the interest of the tribals. Eight of the nine bodies are still lying unclaimed in the mortuary of Churachandpur district hospital.
 
 Of the three bills, the President has withheld the Protection of Manipur People's (PMP) Bill 2015. The remaining two - The Manipur Land Reform and Land Revenue (Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2015, and the Shops and Establishment (2nd Amendment) Bill, 2015 - are being examined by experts.
