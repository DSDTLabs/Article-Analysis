GURUGRAM: More than two months after   vacated the stay on the construction and demolition waste plant in Basai, MCG said on Friday that work on the project has already started and is expected to be complete in the next six months.

 On an average, Gurugram generates around 350 to 400 tonnes of construction waste daily. 
 
  
 “The appointed agency has already started the work and placed the order for the machinery. In all likelihood, the project is expected to be functional within six months,” MCG commissioner Yashpal Yadav told TOI.
 
 The C&D waste plant project, which is Haryana’s first such initiative, was announced in May 2017, with the completion deadline of 2017-end. However, the project hit a roadblock after a Delhi-based NGO filed a case, claiming the project had been proposed on a wetland.
 
 The case went on till January this year when   vacated the stay and gave a nod to project, provided all required clearance and permissions were in place. 
 
 “All the clearances have now been obtained,” the MCG chief said.
 
 The total cost of the project is around Rs 13 crore and it will have a capacity of processing 500 tonnes of construction waste every day. The project is being executed by private agency IL&FS which has also set up one such C&D waste treatment plant in Delhi’s Burari area.
 
 The agency, which has been assigned to carry out the treatment of construction and demolition waste, will recycle it and manufacture tiles, said MCG officials. The tiles will be used by the civic authorities — MCG and   — for their construction projects. The tiles will be purchased by the authorities at Rs 360 per tonne.
 
 “Meanwhile, the collection of the construction waste has already started and it is being collected at the designated waste sites,” said Yadav. With the ever increasing complaints of construction waste being dumped on vacant plots and roadsides, the corporation has designated points in every zone where such waste can be dumped.
