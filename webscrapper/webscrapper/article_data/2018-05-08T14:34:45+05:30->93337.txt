Margao: Nestled amidst the foothills of the Western Ghats,   in Netravali village in Sanguem is blessed with nature’s bounty. However, during the peak summer months, the area witnesses acute water scarcity with its wells and springs drying up.

 Nundem is a 100% tribal-inhabited area with 100 houses and a population of over 500. It is self-sufficient with locals engaged in cultivation of paddy, cashew, sugarcane and vegetables. However, acute water scarcity during the two-months of peak summer season leaves them worried about meeting water needs for their domestic and irrigation requirements. Pipelines were laid in the area decades ago to carry stream water from the upper reaches of the hills to the hamlet, but the government has so far failed to provide treated water, despite the   dam being in the neighbourhood.
 
 The PWD supplies potable water through tankers, but the quantity is insufficient. Recently, a private firm installed 10 tanks of 1,000-litre capacity as part of its corporate social responsibility. This helped alleviate villagers’ hardships to some extent. Deputy sarpanch of   said that as the village lies within the Netravali wildlife sanctuary, there are restrictions in laying of water pipelines. “There are plans of bringing the area under the JICA water supply project, which is underway. Once thats done, all water supply problems will end,”   said.
