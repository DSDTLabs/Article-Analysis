CHANDIGARH: Haryana government has realigned the route map of the proposed metro line between Gurugram and Manesar while changing the category of land from institutional to mix use.

 As a result, the real estate value of the land around the realigned route has shot up. Suspecting foul play, senior   leaders of Haryana have brought the matter to the knowledge of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.
 
 Undeterred, the chief minister’s officer is going ahead with the move. Sources in the state town and country planning ( ) department said, “The changes have been made in the wake of requirement of high density areas around the metro routes. So far as realignment is concerned, it was already approved in 2013.”
 
 Opposition Congress has announced to take up the issue in the budget session of the Haryana assembly. “In fact, we need not raise any issue as their MLAs and officers on special duty are exposing the government.   has its own strategy. This initiative categorically suggests to be a realtor-friendly move,” alleged Ran Singh Mann, a senior Congress leader.
 
 According to information, in its master plan for the 2031, the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) has proposed to connect metro from   to Manesar. Initially, it was supposed to skip Sector 75, which is an institutional zone. Now, in the realigned route, the metro will be passing through the institutional sector and the floor area ratio of the areas around metro route have also been increased. Accordingly, status of the land has been changed.
 
 Sources said the changes were made last month. According to the TCP department, area falling within 800m radius on both sides of the metro route has been declared for mix use menaing 70% area to be used for residential purposes while the remaining will be used for commercial or institutional use.
