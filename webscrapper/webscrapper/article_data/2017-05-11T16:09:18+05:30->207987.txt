The launch of   Season 8 took place in Mumbai on a mega scale and this season will bring a lot of deadly stunts and never seen before action.   director   is going to return as the host this year, too. 

 In an interview with The Times Of India, Rohit Shetty shared a lot of things about Khatron Ke Khiladi Season 8 and also shared his view on the much talked about nepotism debate. 
 
 Here are a few excerpts from the interview of Khatron Ke Khiladi Season 8 host Rohit Shetty: 
 
 
 
 
 I am happy to be back on the show and this season is going to be really big. It will be something that's never been seen before.
 
 
 
 
 Our country is always at a red alert. When shooting at such scenic locations, there is always a threat of an attack happening due to which the shoots may get hampered. Also, permissions from the government is a really big issue as things don't always go smooth here. Our show also involves a lot of animals so in case I need a tiger, I can't get one in India whereas abroad we can get trained animals to help with our stunts.
 
 
 
 
 They initially were but now are slowly going up. Earlier stuntmen used to actually jump from 3-4 storeys but now we can just hook the actors up to a cable and do it. And also a lot of new equipment is being brought to India for such scenes and safety is our number one priority.
 
  
  
 
 
 Well I have a whacky mind. I just think of the stunt in my mind, plan it out and we try to execute it. We also make stuntmen try the stunt first and then make the actors do it so that none of our stunts are totally impossible.
 
 
 
 Well i think this topic is nothing to be discussed about, let alone be argued. The actors who are making statements about nepotism are the ones whose kids you will see working in the industry down the line. It's not a big deal really. I think it's not an issue at all and that it shouldn't have even been brought up in the first place.
