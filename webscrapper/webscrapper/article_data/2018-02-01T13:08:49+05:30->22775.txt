PUNE: Property tax payers without any dues have a reason to cheer for as they will get benefit of a special accident insurance cover of Rs 5 lakh free of cost. 

 The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) had declared the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay Accident Insurance scheme in its 2017-18 budget and the standing committee approved it on Wednesday. The civic body will spend Rs 7 crore on the project.
 
 “The citizens can enjoy the benefits from the 2018-19 fiscal. The committee has finalised the insurance company out of three firms that had approached the civic body,” standing committee chairman   said.
 
 Nearly 8 lakh property owners will be included in the scheme, which will cover injuries and fatalities. The citizens will only have to produce the property tax payment receipts to avail of the scheme’s benefits.
 
 The standing committee also approved the civic body’s proposal to   circuit television cameras. The civic body will spend over Rs 1 crore for the project. 
 
 Sajag Nagrik Manch, a citizens’ group, had objected to the procurement on the ground that it will mean revenue loss for the civic body. Its contention was that the cameras were being purchased at rates higher than market prices.
 
 Mohol said, “The committee has approved the proposal of procuring the cameras at the lowest cost. We will look into the matter and points raised by the citizens’ group.”
