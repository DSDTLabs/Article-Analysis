New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate has summoned former state CM   Devi in connection with its money laundering probe into the railway hotels allotment case, officials said on Tuesday.

 Rabri, wife of RJD chief Lalu Prasad, has been summoned to be present before the investigating officer (IO) of the case on September 26, they said.
 
 The IO is expected to record her statement under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), under which it had registered an FIR against the Lalu Prasad family and others sometime back.
 
 It is understood that this is the second summon by the agency to Rabri after she did not depose before it the first time.
 
 The central probe agency had earlier questioned few people in this case including the wife of former UPA minister P C Gupta.
 
 The Enforcement Directorate had taken cognisance of a CBI FIR in this regard to initiate its own criminal complaint.
 
 In July, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a criminal FIR (first information report) and conducted multiple searches against former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad and others.
 
 The ED will investigate the alleged “proceeds of crime” generated by the accused, purportedly through shell companies, officials said.
