Vijayawada: Now, the common dream of families to own a house is going to come true for one and all in Andhra Pradesh. The state government will construct G+7 houses in   communities for financially backward sections, which will be on par with the ones developed by private builders.

 Chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, who reviewed the progress of urban   on Thursday, said the government will develop   in all 13 districts of the state. Half of the construction cost will be borne by the government. The rest will be paid by the beneficiaries.
 
 “The houses for the poor should be on par with those constructed by private developers. These houses should be designed in such a way so that they become the best in the country. Owning a house is not just having an asset or a property but also a sentiment. These NTR Nagars should have a serene and peaceful atmosphere,” he said.
 
 Naidu added that henceforth he will weekly monitor the progress of the urban housing sector. He asked officials to conduct housing workshops for the benefit of the beneficiaries.
 
 The chief minister asked the officials to complete categorization of the beneficiaries in the next three days. He advised them to take a cue from the gated community houses that have come up at Rapthadu in Anantapur district. He also reminded them of the 30,000 houses constructed in Jakkampudi near Vijayawada where government provides electricity, water, road and other infrastructure.
 
 The CM also put stress on the necessity of social infrastructure in these gated communities, including economic activities. He said in a single constituency like Nandyal in Kurnool, the government is shelling out 800 crore to build houses- of which the government subsidy is Rs 400 crore. While the land costs Rs 250 crore, infrastructure like water, electricity and parks will be developed at a cost of Rs 150 crore. He said that such houses should come up in all the assembly constituencies.
