CHENNAI: Finding art in between the crevices of rotten wood, within the folds of wrinkled flowers, in the impressions left by coffee stains and in spaces beyond the four walls - memory, preservation and rejuvenation come together in the exhibits of four city-based artists. 

 Instead of   through  ,  , uses dry pressed flowers as a  , places and time. The lotus is indelibly tied with the afternoons in her grandmother's house, the roses from her aunt's wedding and the nagalinga poo has her reminiscing of her first music class. "My photo journal and prints of flowers is a reflection of organic memories associated with each of their smell, colour and feel and how they can trigger emotions," says Zachariah, youngest among the artists at Art Houz.
 
 What looks old harbours a myriad of sentiments is what   has felt too, which is what made her take up furniture restoration a year ago. "When I come across any junk piece, I can read the stories behind it," says the corporate employee by day and artist by night. In her creations, she has transformed a window frame into a coffee table and given a new life to a meat safe.
 
 Just as the grains of wood speak to Prudence, coffee grounds make for an interesting conversation in the creative space for Nirupama Francis. "Coffee decoction leaves impressions which are difficult to change and on the canvas I have tried to use this medium to capture what the psyche to people today. Some are caught in their world of selfies, some have paradoxes like the concept of Western desi," says Francis, also a freelance graphic designer.
 
 Among the four artists,  's frames of a ballet dancer in the backdrop of TN beaches, forests and buildings is a representation of an overhaul that perspectives require to look at life anew. Edward is the thread that connects others who have been his students. "The idea was to feel at one with Nature while creating art," says the faculty member of MOP Vaishnav College.
