Jaisalmer: The Barmer   case has taken a new turn. The girl Ritu, whose parents alleged that she was brainwashed and kidnapped by a Kashmiri youth uploaded two videos on her social media account on Tuesday refuting all the claims made by her parents.

 Ritu aka Zainab said all the allegations levelled on her husband, Gulzar Khan by her family are wrong and untrue. She further produced all the documents like the marriage certificate, marriage agreement etc and claimed all these were original with her signatures and fingerprint. In the video she said that about a month ago, she had taken a ticket upto Baroda but got down at Ahmadabad and from there she took a flight to Delhi and then went to Srinagar and then Kupwara. No one was with her and she even showed the boarding pass and other documents in which she claimed that she was alone and that can be proved by airport footage.
 
 She further said that she is happy with her husband and has married him with consent. She even produced her birth certificate which stated that she is running 19. She made a request to the SP that she is an adult and should be allowed to live her life as she wishes. She said she married Gulzar with consent and that her father should not interfere in her life as she is happy. She has also registered her statement with police and has sent the copy to Barmer police.
