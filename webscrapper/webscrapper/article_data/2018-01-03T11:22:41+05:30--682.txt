WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: The United States accused Pakistan on Tuesday of playing a "double game" on fighting terrorism and warned Islamabad it would have to do more if it wanted to maintain US aid.

 "They can do more to stop terrorism and we want them to do that,"   spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.
 
 The White House said it would likely announce actions to pressure Pakistan within days, shortly after US ambassador   said at the United Nations that 
  .
 
 "There are clear reasons for this. 
  ," Haley told reporters. "They work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan.
 
 "That game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism."
 
 "The president is willing to go to great lengths to stop all funding from Pakistan as they continue to harbour and support terrorism," said Haley.
 
 The comments followed an angry tweet from President   on Monday that the United States had been rewarded with "nothing but lies and deceit" for "foolishly" giving Pakistan more than $33 billion in aid in the last 15 years.
 
 "They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help. No more!" he tweeted.
 
  
  
 
 Pakistan civilian and military chiefs on Tuesday rejected 
  and summoned American Ambassador David Hale to explain Trump's tweet.
 
 
  
 
  
  
 
 Relations with Washington have been strained for years over Islamabad's alleged support for Haqqani network militants, who are allied with the Afghan  .
 
 The United States also alleges that senior Afghan Taliban commanders live on Pakistani soil, and has signalled it will cut aid and take other steps if Islamabad does not stop helping or turning a blind eye to Haqqani militants crossing the border to carry out attacks in Afghanistan.
 
 In 2016, Taliban leader Mullah Mansour was killed by a US drone strike inside Pakistan and in 2011, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found and killed by US troops in the garrison town of Abbottabad.
 
 
 
 
 At the State Department on Tuesday, spokesman Heather Nauert said Pakistan knows what it needs to do, including taking action against the Haqqani network and other militants.
 
 Pakistan needs to "earn, essentially, the money that we have provided in the past in foreign military assistance," she said.
 
 Islamabad bristles at the suggestion it is not doing enough to fight militants, noting that its casualties at the hands of Islamists since 2001 number in the tens of thousands.
 
 Pakistani Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Tuesday chaired a National Security Committee meeting of civilian and military chiefs, focusing on Trump's tweet. The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, was brought forward by a day and followed an earlier meeting of army generals.
 
 The committee, in a statement issued by the prime minister's office, did not name Trump but spoke of "deep disappointment" at a slew of critical comments coming from US officials over the past few months.
 
 "Recent statements and articulation by the American leadership were completely incomprehensible as they contradicted facts manifestly, struck with great insensitivity at the trust between two nations built over generations, and negated the decades of sacrifices made by the Pakistani nation," it said.
