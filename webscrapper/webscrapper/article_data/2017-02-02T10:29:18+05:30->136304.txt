LUDHIANA: For the families and friends of people injured in the twin   district’s Maur town on Tuesday evening, terror struck with official apathy.

 Schoolboy Ankush (11) was playing outside his house with friends, welding shop owner Amrik Singh (26) was winding up for the day, and Jaskaran Singh (26) was returning home from a temple when the two blasts ripped through Truck Union Road of Maur. 
 
 Amrik’s father, Rajinder Singh, said he saw his son on fire as soon as he rushed out of the house on hearing the sound of the blast. “We put blankets around him to douse the fire. I immediately phoned the ambulance, but rescue workers were busy treating VIPs,” he said.
 
 Faced by a shortage of time and left with no other option, Rajinder hired a private ambulance and took Amrik to Bathinda civil hospital. “From there, doctors referred us to   and Hospital, Faridkot. After some treatment, Amrik was referred to   and Hospital (DMCH), Ludhiana, and we reached here at 4am,” he said.
 
 Jaskaran had gotten married two years ago and became a father last month. A resident of Maur Kalan, he had walked to a nearby temple along with uncles Nichatar Singh and Harnek Singh. On the way back, his uncles moved ahead, while Jaskaran stopped near the Congress election meeting.
 
 His neighbour Gurcharan Singh, who took him to a hospital, said Jaskaran lost his parents in his childhood. “He lives with his uncles,” he said.
 
 Ankush’s father Gian Chand, who works in the state education department, said it was horrifying to see his son’s face brunt. “I saw him screaming in pain. It was unbearable, but did we have option?”
 
 
 Ankush with 60% burns
 
 Ankush has suffered 60% burns, while Amrik and Jaskaran Singh have 30-35% burns, said doctors. All three are admitted in the burns unit of DMCH, Ludhiana.
