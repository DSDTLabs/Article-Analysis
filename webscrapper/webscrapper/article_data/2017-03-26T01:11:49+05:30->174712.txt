MUMBAI: After trying their luck with Farhan Sayed (38) whose   they had stolen at Satamwadi signal in Andheri (east) on March 21, the   members are now trying to strike a deal with the police by offering to retrun the stolen phone in exchange of their accomplice. The police answered their ‘offer’ by arresting two more members of their   from a South Mumbai lodge on Friday. A team has also been sent to Meerut, where Sayed’s phone was tracked. 

 Andheri police officials were taken by surprise when one of the gang members repeatedly called them and tried to negotiate saying that they would return Sayed’s phone if an FIR against their member Najis Shaikh (22), who was held on March 21, is not filed. 
 
 Shaikh’s arrest led the police team to two more—Latif Shaikh (35) and Mohammed Qureshi (22)—in lodges in Dongri and Pydhonie localities. “The arrested trio said that the gang hails from Meerut and their sponsor arranges their train tickets, food, drugs and lodging in Mumbai. The gang leaves city after they achieve a target of stealing mobile worth around Rs4 lakh,” said the investigators.
 
 A police officer said that the accused, who fled with Sayed’s phone, called him and asked him to not file an FIR. “Shaikh’s partner called and said that he will return the victim’s mobile if we do not pursue the case,” said the officer. 
 
 Investigators have learnt that the gang comprises of eight people and visit Mumbai to steal high-end mobiles in a period of two to three months. “If a member of the gang is caught in Mumbai then they change their location temporarily and operate in Bangalore or Hyderabad,” said the police. The trio arrested is in police custody till March 28.
