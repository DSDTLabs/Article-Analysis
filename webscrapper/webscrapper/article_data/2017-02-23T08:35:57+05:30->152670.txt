KANNUR:  , the dalit auto rickshaw dri ver from Edat near Payyan nur in the dis trict, who had to leave her native home following harassment from CPM workers, will get a new house at   where previous government allotted her a piece of land, with the support of Azhikkode MLA K M Shaji.

 Shaji told a press conference here on Wednesday that the house will be built with the support of Gulf-based voluntary organization,  . The move comes after the LDF government cancelled the financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh announced by the previous UDF government, when her plight came to the light.
 
 “The previous government had given her five cents of land near Kattampally and had also announced a financial assistance of Rs 5 lakh, after her survival in her native place became difficult. But that financial help has been cancelled by the present government,“ he said.
 
 The irony is that while the RSS threat to prevent chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan from attending a communal harmony meeting in Mangaluru is being termed as fascism, his party workers are doing the same to a hapless lady in her own native village, which also should be termed fascism, said the MLA.
 
 Chitralekha said that she is facing threat from the CPM workers even at Kattampally, and that they were not allowing her to carry out the foundation work of the house. She said she was targeted by the CPM workers at Edat who did not want her to ply an auto rickshaw for a living.
 
 “Though I did not get the fund I was somehow planning to build the house when the local CPM leaders came with the threat, following which I stopped the work,“ said Chitralekha whose auto rickshaws were set ablaze and attacked many times allegedly by the CPM workers in the last few years.
