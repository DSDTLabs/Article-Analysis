VADODARA: A tobacco shop owner was allegedly conned by a couple involved in stock broking business to the tune of Rs24 lakh between 2008 and 2012.

 Complainant Subhash More approached Sayajigunj police station where a case of cheating was registered against   and his wife Mittal on Monday.
 
 More told police that   was a regular customer at his shop because of which they became friends. Brahmbhatt told the complainant that he is into stock broking and commodities trading business and asked him to invest money. Initially, More invested Rs13,000 for which he received an interest of Rs2,000.
 
 Police said that until May 2011, More had invested Rs19 lakh in different amounts in   through cheque and cash. Later Brahmbhatt proposed partnership to More so that he will not have to pay commission to him. More agreed to it and paid Rs10 lakh, while Mittal invested another Rs10 lakh. More received interest on that money twice. In 2012, when he wanted to withdraw his investment since he was in need of the money, Brahmbhatt started making excuses and kept dilly-dallying.
 
 More tried to contact the couple at their office and home, but did not find them. He approached the police a few weeks back with his complaint. He told the police in his complaint that he did not receive Rs14.5 lakh which he had invested in the commodities through the accused and the amount which he had invested for the partnership firm.
 
 Interestingly, cops are yet to find out why More complained after six years of the incident.
 
 “We have registered the case on the basis of the complaint received by More. He is yet to give us a detailed statement and other papers for investigation,” said a police official.
