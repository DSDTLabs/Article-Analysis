Kalyan: Nearly a month after an attempt was made on Shiv   Prashant Kale’s life, police arrested his friend  , a   from  , and three of his associates. 

  claimed Mahesh had planned the attack on Kale to implicate Sena leader and builder  , their ‘common enemy’. “Primary probe shows that Mahesh and Sanjay were involved in a property dispute that’s why Mahesh planned an attack on his friend, who too has a bone to pick with Sanjay, to implicate him,” said senior police inspector Kalyanji Ghete.
 
 Prashant, husband of corporator Madhuri Kale, is shocked that his friend would go to such lengths to get back at Sanjay. “I am very upset that Mahesh planned an attack on me to seek revenge from Sanjay,” Kale told TOI. “He visited me in hospital and told me to tell the police that I suspected Sanjay’s hand in the attack.”
 
 Police claimed Mahesh invited Kale home on March 8, so that he knew his whereabouts. After dinner, when Kale reached his residence in Vijay Nagar, four-five men attacked him with iron rods and swords. He suffered severe injuries and was rushed to a private hospital. Police went through the CCTV footage of the attack, identified historysheeters Anil Jagtap and Prashant Katolkar and arrested them. During interrogation, they confessed that Prashant Bote, an aide of Mahesh, had given a supari to kill Kale. 
 
 On Saturday, police arrested Bote who said he only followed Mahesh’s instructions as the latter wanted to frame Sanjay in the case. Police, with help of Patharli police from Ahmednagar district, nabbed Mahesh on Sunday. The accused were booked under IPC sections 307 for   and 120A for conspiracy to murder.
