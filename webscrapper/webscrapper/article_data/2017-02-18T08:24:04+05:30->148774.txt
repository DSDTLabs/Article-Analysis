KURUKSHETRA:   is grappling with staff shortage as half of the posts in the university are lying vacant, claimed Kurukshetra University Teachers Association (KUTA). The last recruitment of a professor took place in 2007 and 25   were hired in 2012. This has resulted in an imbalance between retirement and recruitment of faculty members, the association said.

 KUTA chairman, Dr. Sanjeev Sharma said, “For traditional courses budget for 300 posts and for self-financed 100 posts were financed in 2005-2006 by the University grants commission (UGC) and after 11 years we just have 402 faculties which are almost half of what is required. We need more faculties as courses have doubled and so have the student’s number.”
 
 He added, “The total budget of university is Rs 351 crores but the university only gets 22% of that from the government i.e. Rs 77 crores. The remaining amount of Rs 274 crores, the university is managing on its own assets such as fees, old fixed deposits. The university is paying approximately Rs 142 crores of salary and Rs 26 crores of pensions.
 
 The decentralization of courses such as B.ed and B.tech will be another setback to the revenue of university. Last year, the state government decided to affiliate all the engineering colleges to Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology, Murthal, while B.ed colleges will be affiliated to Chaudhary Ranbir Singh University, Jind.
 
 KUTA members said that the university should get direct finance from ministry of human resource development as per Rashtriya uchchatar shiksha abhiyan (RUSA), a centrally sponsored scheme. According to sources, the staff crunch has led PhD research scholars to take classes of other courses.
