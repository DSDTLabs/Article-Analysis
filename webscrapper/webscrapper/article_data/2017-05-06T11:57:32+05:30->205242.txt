The two thieves begin to fight, when one of them kills the other. He then points a gun at   but   comes in between. When he shoots, they are able to escape. Shivaay then rushes towards him angrily. Luckily, the inspector who had taken help from them arrives and kills the thief.
 
  Shivaay scolds Anika for always trying to save him from death. When she tells him that she is like that only, he also confesses that he is trying to change himself. He has the habit of trying to know everything about people. He also tells her that he has accepted her for life and they will stick together no matter how difficult the circumstances.
  
  Just when they are thinking of ways to go back home, Anika finds a scooty. Shivaay feels awkward to sit on it, and Anika teases him for the same.
  
  When they reach home, Pinky reprimands Shivaay for not telling his whereabouts to her. She tells him how worried she was. Shivaay pacifies her anger and promises that they will have lunch together. However, Pinky cannot digest his concern and affection for Anika. She decides to ruin Anika's life.
  
  Later, she informs Shivaay that he has a press conference. And also asks him about the date for Kulgotra Puja. Shivaay tells her that he won't have any puja. Anika is shocked to learn this. She asks Shivaay if she has done it for her but he tells her that it is for their relationship.
