VADODARA:   registered a   on Saturday in connection with   worth Rs nine lakh from a company at Manjusar   that took place in July last year.

 According to the complainant Nasir Pinjari, who owns Sargam Electroplater Private Limited at Manjusar GIDC, he had given his complaint immediately after the incident took place. The police had visited his factory to probe the incident. 
 
 After some months, when Pinjari went to get a copy of FIR, he was told by the police that the FIR was not registered. Pinjari then approached the Gujarat high court complaining about the inaction on the part of Savli police in not registering the FIR. The high court in December directed the police to look into Pinjari’s complaint and after an inquiry register an FIR. The police then again visited Pinjari’s company and registered a case against unidentified persons on Saturday.
