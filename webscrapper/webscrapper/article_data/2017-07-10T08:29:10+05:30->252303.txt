PUNE: The Pune division of the central railways will soon set up special rooms for baby feeding at five more stations in the division.

 A room called ‘Hirkani Kaksh’ was recently started for the purpose at the Pune railway station. Senior railway officials said that similar facility will be set up at Satara, Sangli, Karad, Miraj and   stations very soon.
 
 The move came after the railway ministry issued directives to include baby-feeding rooms at stations. The decision will provide privacy to mothers wanting to breastfeed their infants within such a crowded atmosphere. 
 
 “A room has been opened at platform number 1 of the Pune station. We are sure that the facility will prove helpful for women. Other stations will follow suit. Though a definite time frame cannot be given, it has been decided that the rooms will be set up at five stations,” said  , senior division commercial manager.
 
 However, some railway sources said that mere arrangement of a private space was not enough. “We need to keep the rooms clean and tidy. Our men at Pune junction have received instructions in the connection. Also, security is the most important aspect and women wishing to use the facility shouldn’t be worried about anything. Officials and women constables of the government railway police (GRP) do the rounds of the platforms regularly. They will ensure that the rooms are safe for women and their infants,” said an official.
 
 Another official said that Pune station could see more of these rooms. “The idea is being considered but a final decision has yet to be taken. Pune station witnesses passenger traffic of around two lakh every day. There are six platforms in all. Thus, there is a need for more feeding rooms at the station,” the official said.
 
 Passengers believe that there should be at least one such room on each platform at the Pune station.
