RANCHI: The nearly 300-kilometre-long   is almost ready for use. Almost, because the state government’s plan to get   to inaugurate it has run into a minor hurdle called Littipara, where the assembly by-election is scheduled on  , the day the Prime Minister is supposed to visit  . 

 The state government had hoped to get the highway inaugurated during Modi’s visit to lay the foundation stone of the Ganga Bridge, connecting Bihar and Jharkhand, over river Ganga. But the model code of conduct has put a spanner in the works, since a part of the highway runs through Littipara. 
 
 Even as the government awaits the approval from the election commission, Chief Minister Raghubar Das held a meeting with BJP’s members on Sunday to discuss the issue as well as the strategy for Littipara bypoll. 
 
 Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Poddar, who was part of the meeting, said: “Some part of the highway falls in the Littpara assembly constituency where the bypoll will be held on April 6.”
 
 Shivpujan Pathak, BJP’s media in charge, said: “People of Santhal Pargana are very excited about the PM’s visit to Sahibganj. Modalities of the mega event on April 6 at Sahibganj were discussed during the meeting on Sunday along with Littipara bypoll, which we expect to win. The state government has done much for the development of Santhal Pargana. These aspects will reflect in the bypoll results.”
 
 Prior to this meeting with regional committee members, Das presided over a meeting of BJP’s Alpasankhyak Morcha executive committee. Das announced that on April 2, President Pranab Mukherjee will lay the foundation stone for a Haj House in Ranchi. 
 
 “The Haj House was a target of corruption during the terms of previous governments. Even after being set up at a cost of Rs 8 crore, the house developed faults. Now we are committed to build a Haj House which will be one of a kind in the country, at a cost of Rs 67 crore,” Das said.
