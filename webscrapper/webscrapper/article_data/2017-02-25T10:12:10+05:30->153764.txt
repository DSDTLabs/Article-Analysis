 BJP tried the communal card during the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and won.This time it's not going to happen. People have understood them. Provoking people will not yield any results. Janata neta se zyada chalaak hai (voters are more intelligent than politicians).
 
 
 
 
 BJP's attempt to charm the MBCs is shallow. The MBCs have always been with the Dalits and will continue to do so. This time, they are going to join hands with Muslims. The combination now looks like Â­ Backward-Dalit-Muslim. MBCs, like Dalits, are also annoyed with the BJP because of RSS which is against reservation in jobs.
 
 
 
 
 That is out of sheer frustration. They are seeing Muslims coming with us and, therefore, trying to spread these rumours. People have made up their mind for a government which can give robust law and order.
 
 
 
 
 Jissey darr hota hai usi pe hamla karte hain (You attack one who you fear the who you fear the most). They have not attacked SPCongress alliance the way they have attacked Behenji.SP means BJP and BJP means SP (there's no difference between the two parties).
 
 
 
 Saheb (Kanshiram) aur Behenji ne yahan bahut kaam kiya hai. Behenji has been an MLA from here only. But Ambedkarnagar alone would not bring BSP back to power.For us, the whole state is important. We need to register a win in all districts.
