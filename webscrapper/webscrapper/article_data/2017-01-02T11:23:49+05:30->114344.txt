HYDERABAD: Even as elaborate arrangements were made to check untoward incidents, police said they registered as many as 1,594   cases across the three commissionerates on New Year's eve.

 The Hyderabad cops registered 957 cases, while their   and Rachakonda counterparts registered 400 and 237 cases respectively.
 
 Vehicles of the offenders were seized on the spot. At one point, Hyderabad traffic police had to slow down because of the lack of home guards to drive the seized vehicles to police stations and insufficient parking space at traffic police stations to keep the vehicles.
