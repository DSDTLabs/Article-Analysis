BIHARSHARIF: Chief minister   is likely to inaugurate month-long   on May 16.

The reward for any noble act done this month is ten times more than the reward for the same act in any other month, he said and added Hindus do not perform any religious function during the month.
 
 Several hundred thousand pilgrims from different parts of the country visit the   at which theatres are the main attraction for youths. Different rides fascinate children, while hundreds of shops put up by self-help groups and others do brisk business at the fair.
