NAGPUR: Once again, it was proved that inefficient officials of NMC acts only after judiciary’s hammering. On Friday, the civic body took action against nine establishments including two hospitals in congested Dhantoli and Ramdaspeth areas, after Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Thursday, sternly directed them to act. Earlier also, NMC had assured to act after court directives in October 2015, but miserably failed to comply.

 On Friday, the drive started from   where the squad armed with a JCB machine demolished illegal construction at the parking place of Shrikrishna Hospital. The squad also razed illegal construction at the basement of Avanti Hospital. However, the squad stopped razing the   of both the hospitals after their administrations gave in writing that they will raze all illegal constructions on their own. “Both the hospitals also paid fine of Rs10,000 each to the zone,” said an official from the Dhantoli zone.
 
 Others who faced the action included   (Dhantoli), Siddhivinayak Nivas (Dhantoli),   (Dhantoli) and   (Ramdaspeth) and roadside vendors in front of Deekshabhoomi. The squad also seized two handcarts from Aathrasta Chowk.
