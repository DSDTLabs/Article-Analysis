HYDERABAD: Departing from the usual practice of confining oneself to exchange of pleasantries during Republic Day celebrations,   president Challa   on Friday expressed apprehensions over the efforts to shift the   to a temporary building in and around Vijayawada.

 Blaming the judiciary, judges to be precise, for going ahead with the plans made by the state government, the Bar president urged the judges to take the Bar into confidence. “So far we are not involved in the process,” he said and added that this is causing lot of anxiety among advocates in general and the junior lawyers in particular.
 
 
 Dhananjaya said there was talk of first shifting to a temporary accommodation and then to a permanent structure. This amounts to shifting twice for lawyers who have to move with their families and belongings, he said, underlining difficulties involved in the process.
 
 While stating that there was no problem in moving to the new   once the permanent structure is ready, he said, “but if you move out in the interim, all advocates too have to move because there are issues like local status to their children etc.” Dhananjaya urged judges, particularly the building committee, to make lawyers part of the debate on the shifting. Though the Acting CJ spoke after him, he did not touch this subject in his speech. He felt that this was not the forum to raise the subject.
