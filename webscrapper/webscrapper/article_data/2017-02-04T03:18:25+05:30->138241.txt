VARANASI: Amid the cacophony of political campaigns by various parties, folk songs enticing people to come out and vote are reverberating through the rural lanes of Varanasi these days.

 “Suna ho bhaiya, suna ho behna, maan le tu humar kehana; voting ke din ghar mat rehna, varna paanch saal padega sehana...” sing a group of women in a bylane here. The lines translate to ‘Listen brothers and sisters, don’t stay home on voting day or you will regret for fi ve years’. Armed with such ‘sohar’ (folk) songs and street plays, several groups of rural women are educating voters on the need to exercise their franchise.
 
 These women are members of Green Group, fi ghting against evils like alcohol abuse and gambling in their villages. “It is our duty to not only cast our vote but also make others do so,” said Asha Devi of Khusiyari village. Varanasi votes on March 8.
