Yesterday, the actress’ spokesperson confirmed that she won’t be doing the film, but for a different reason altogether. Initially, it was reported that Vidya didn’t agree with director Kamal’s views on PM Narendra Modi’s demonetisation drive. 

 A source says, “'Aami' is based on the life of   aka Kamala Das, who questioned the hypocrisies of the society through her writings, and Vidya was quite kicked about the project. She had, in fact, started brushing on her Malayalam. But she realised that her approach towards the film was different from the director’s and they couldn’t agree on most aspects of filmmaking. So, she has bowed out of the project amicably.”
 
 Kamal remained unavailable for comments till the time of going to press.
