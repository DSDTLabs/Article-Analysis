NEW DELHI: The Employeesâ€™   Organisation ( ) on Wednesday declared an interest rate of 8.55% for 2017-18 for over 5 crore members, lower than 8.65% for 2016-17.

 
 This is the second time in a row that the retirement fund entity has decreased the interest rates for its subscribers. The EPFO had announced 8.65% rate of interest on deposits for 2016-17 and in 2015-16 it was fixed at 8.8%.
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 At Central Board of Trustees ( ) meeting, the EPFO decided to lower the rate even after the reports that the retirement body had sold a portion of its investments in exchange-traded funds (ETF) worth Rs 2,886 crore earlier as it wanted to retain the rate at 8.65%.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 Sources also said the EPFO had earned a return of Rs 1,054 crore on sale of ETFs in February, which would be sufficient to persist with 8.65% rate of interest in the current fiscal year.
 
 The EPFO, which manages a corpus of over Rs 10 lakh crore, has been investing in ETFs since August 2015. The EPFO has invested around Rs 44,000 crore in the ETFs till date. While the EPFO has lowered the interest, the returns from PF deposits are still attractive in comparison with other investment schemes like PPF and bank deposits, which draw lower interest rates. Last year, the government had trimmed the rates on small savings schemes such as National Savings Certificate and PPF by 20 basis points but spared senior citizens.
