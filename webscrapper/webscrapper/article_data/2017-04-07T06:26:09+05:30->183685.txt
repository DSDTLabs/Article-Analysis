AHMEDABAD: For the first time, the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) will be conducting online auctions of volumetric land footprints of two buildings on the Riverfront. The   for the   is being developed by TCS. "By conducting the auction online, many international players will be able to participate," said a senior official of the SRFDCL. 

 The state government has recently approved the   (volume-based)   Control Regulations (GDCR), with which volumetric development will now be available for developers on the Riverfront. SRFDCL is likely to auction two building footprints, one each on either bank by second week of May claim sources.
 
 "We expect the real estate market to stabilize before we announce the dates. We had postponed the decision in December last year because of demonetization. This year, we expect the real estate markets to stabilize by May," said an  . Four buildings of the 42 proposed on the Riverfront will be 101 metres tall.
 
 The 'footprint' will be the land area on which the proposed building can be built while the 'volume envelope' will define the height up to which it can be constructed. The rider is that none of the footprints will be sold to developers. "The media plan for the SRFDCL auction is being readied and will be launched across the country by May. We will gauge the interests of investors in the project," adds the SRFDCL official.
