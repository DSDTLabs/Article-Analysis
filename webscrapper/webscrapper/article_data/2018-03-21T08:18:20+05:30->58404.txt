CHANDIGARH: The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLAs staged a walkout from   on Tuesday during the governor’s address to the House at the start of the budget session. Speaking about the reasons for AAP legislators’ walkout, leader of the opposition   said, “The governor’s address was disappointing and there was nothing new in it.”

 He said the AAP MLAs did not find any justification in listening to bundle of lies by sitting inside the assembly hall as they were expecting announcement of various initiatives in the governor’s address.
 
 Khaira said, “The Amarinder Singh government has not taken cognizance of the statements of international drug cartels and drug racket kingpin   against former minister Bikram Singh Majithia.” He added 40 MLAs had submitted memorandum on this issue to the chief minister. Khaira said local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had recently shown the STF’s latest affidavit submitted in the high court and it was surprising that 40 MLAs were not being heard on the issue.
 
 “We had come to the assembly to hear whether there would be an announcement about the CBI probe by Captain Amarinder Singh through governor against Bikram Majithia and other influential drug cartels,” said Khaira.
 
 The leader of the opposition said the chief minister had few days ago tweeted about the mining mafia being operational in six rivulets but there was not even a single word in the governor’s address about the action taken because of the involvement of a sitting minister, a former minister and few   MLAs. Illegal mining is continuously going on in   for the last one year, he said.
 
 Khaira also pointed out the best human resource in Punjab is being forced to migrate to various countries by paying lakhs of rupees to immigration agents because of government’s negligence.
