 Former   captain   wept, repeatedly apologised and was unable to finish a press conference at Sydney Airport.   too wiped a tear or two and announced that he would step down as the team’s coach after this week’s Test match against  . 
 
 Sacked vice-captain David Warner took to Instagram to accept responsibility for his misdeeds. And rookie   admitted to reporters, “I lied. I lied about the sandpaper. I feel like I’ve let everyone down in Australia.”
 
 “Ultimately I’m responsible for the culture of the team...It’s only fair that I make this decision,” Lehmann said in Johannesburg. Cricket Australia had cleared him of wrongdoing in the ball-tampering saga.
 
 “It was a failure of leadership, of my leadership, I’ll do anything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused,” Smith said, before breaking down.
 
 Former Test cricketer Shane Warne denounced the cheating but also pointed out that the hysteria whipped up by anti-Australian feeling around the world had led to excessively stringent sentences.
 
 “The hysteria has gone worldwide, and everyone that dislikes the way the Australian cricket team has played ... has been given the opportunity to lay the boots in,” arguably the world’s greatest-ever leg-spinner said.
