A team of IT professionals have managed to impress Century Star   with their dance cover of the   song, from his latest film, Tagaru. The actor was so awed by the cover made by Sweven & The Amigos that he not only invited the team to his house, but also offered   — who not only stars in the video, but has also directed it, choreographed it and is the man behind the concept — a chance to choreograph the title song of his next,  .

 An excited Prajwal tells us, “After we uploaded the dance cover online, one of Shivarajkumar’s fan association presidents liked it so much that he showed it to him. Shivanna asked us to meet him on the set of  , where he spent around 40 minutes with us in his caravan, watching the video and talking to us about it. He liked that our cover had a story as well. He invited us to his house the same evening and there, he promised to speak to Rustom director   to give me a chance to choreograph the title track of the film. I had heard about how humble Shivanna is, but I never expected him to be so down to earth. I am thrilled.”
