NEW DELHI: The Delhi   wants to know if the   set up under the new benami law has passed any order against health minister Satyendar Jain.

 Jain had sought permission from the authority, set up in 2016, to cross-examine witnesses in connection with the alleged benami case against him.
 
 Earlier this week, Justice   had asked the authority to inform the court if any order on Jain’s plea has been issued.
 
 HC acted on an application by Jain seeking a stay on the proceedings before the authority on the ground that the initiating officer’s order to provisionally attach his alleged assets was passed without allowing him to cross-examine witnesses.
 
 “The entire proceedings before the authority were illegal as various witness testimonies are not being provided to the petitioner. It is trite law that fair hearing includes supply of all documents, whether they have been relied upon or not, at the time of final adjudication,” the minister’s plea argues.
 
 The health minister further pointed out that such ‘denial of an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, on whose statements reliance has been placed, is contrary to all canons and principles of natural justice and fair play.’
 
 While the lawyer for the adjudicating authority maintained that once an order has been issued, the minister would get a chance to appeal against it, the court termed it “prima facie very odd” that “the adjudicating authority neither accepted the application for cross-examination, nor decided it.”
 
 It sought an explanation by February 21.
 
 Jain has challenged the proceedings against him and claimed that the 2016 law can’t be applied retrospectively as the assets were purchased between 2011 and March 31, 2016.
 
 The minister’s plea is that either the proceedings under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act be stayed or the adjudicating authority be directed not to pass a final order till his petition in the high court is finally decided.
