 Speaking on behalf of the employees, their union president Santosh Sahai said, "They were ready to talk with a delegation of our union comprising four office bearers of the two factions of employees union.

 "If the VC wants us to talk, he will have to include Mishra too or face the consequences. Is Rohit an outsider that he cannot accompany us?" asked Sahai.
