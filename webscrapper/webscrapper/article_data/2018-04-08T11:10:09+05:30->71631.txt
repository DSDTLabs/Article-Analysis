 "At a basic level, I just worked out what I was experiencing in my own head. My life was changing but, subconsciously, I was battling that," he told .
 
 He added: "I can only say this now - I didn't know it at the time - but to interact with fans was to admit that there were fans, And to admit there were fans was to admit that I wasn't just George from Hertford - and I didn't want that.
 
 "So there was that element of taking in everything that happened and seeing, 'OK, it's not a bad thing at all, you're not in a bad place, it's a really good situation'."
