Ludhiana: The police arrested a drug peddler after 500gm heroin, worth Rs 2.5 crore in international market, was recovered from his possession in Salem Tabri on Thursday. 

 A Special Task Force (STF) team was patrolling near Buddha Nullah in Salem Tabri. On seeing the cops, Jaswinder Singh, 42, tried to run away but was soon chased and nabbed. 
 
 STF in-charge inspector Harbans Singh said, “Jaswinder, a resident of Chabbewal, Hoshiarpur district, was earlier a labourer. He took to drug peddling to augment his income. Initially, he used to sell poppy husk. Hoshiarpur police had arrested him in 2015. In jail, he learned that heroin smuggling was more lucrative. When he was bailed out a year later, he started peddling heroin.”
 
 Jaswinder, who is also an addict, was in the city to deliver the contraband to a customer.
 
 “He told during interrogation that he procured heroin from Jalandhar, Phillaur and Hoshiarpur smugglers and sold it in nearby districts. When Jaswinder’s wife came to know about his drug dealings, she parted ways with him.”
