PUNE: Writing   on the debit card cover to remember it proved costly for a 33-year-old BPO employee from Dhankawdi.

 Two unidentified men snatched his pouch containing two cards and cash of Rs 500 on Sunday and withdrew Rs 11,000 using the debit card.
 
 Abhilekh Cukkemane filed a complaint against the unidentified duo at the Sahakarnagar police station.
 
 Cukkemane resides at Teen Hatti Chowk in Dhankawdi. On Sunday around 3.45am, he went to Trimurti Chowk to eat poha. His motorcycle had almost run out of fuel, so he had to walk up to the eatery. He was carrying a pouch having Rs500 cash and two debit cards.
 
 While he was on his way, a motorbike-borne duo stopped near him and one of the two suspects attempted to   his pouch. “I held on to my pouch and started resisting him. But, they pushed me away and fled with it in the direction of Satara Road,” he said.
 
 Card swiped thrice
 
 Cukkemane said that around 4.48am, he received the first SMS stating Rs5,000 had been withdrawn from his account using the debit card. “In the next few minutes, transactions of Rs 5,000 and Rs 1,000 were done at an ATM kiosk near Katraj,” he said.
 
 “Totally, the duo robbed me of Rs11,500,” he added.
 
 Chetan More, assistant inspector of the Sahakarnagar police, told TOI that the complainant informed the police that he had noted down the PIN of one of the cards on its cover so as to remember it.
