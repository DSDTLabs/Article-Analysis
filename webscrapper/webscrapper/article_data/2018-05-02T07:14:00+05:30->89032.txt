GURUGRAM: MCG on Tuesday sealed 19 commercial properties in Gurugram’s zone one and zone two for non-payment of property taxes. Of these, 15 properties were located in  . 

 According to the officials, the   due for these 15 shops amounted to Rs 20 lakh while the rest had a pending bill of Rs 12.21 lakh. The defaulting owners were issued notices by the department but as none responded, the   was carried on. 
 
 “We had issued them notices for the payment of the property taxes but they did not pay heed. Now, if they don’t clear their dues, the properties will be auctioned,” said an MCG official. 
 
 After having collected the highest ever property tax in the previous year at Rs 400 crore, the corporation is trying hard to carry on with the momentum in this financial year as well. “We have been issued directions to carry on with the sealing and the demolition drives in the city unless all defaulters clear their dues,” the official added. In April, the corporation recovered over Rs 3 crore from multiple banquet halls in the city that hadn’t cleared the bills from some time. 
 
 A special property tax collection drive has been started for the banquet halls in the city as most of them haven’t paid their taxes ever since the corporation was formed around a decade back.
