Mysuru: One of the major attractions of the   car festival is the newly built 40-tonne Maharatham ( ), which is 55 feet in height.

 The chariot, which took nearly two years to build, was sculpted by Basavaraj Badiger, a fourth generation sculptor from a family which is engaged in chariot building for centuries. Both his sons are also experts in chariot sculpture works.
 
 Basavaraj told TOI that the Maharatham at Suttur was the 51st chariot built by him. “I started learning this art when I was just 12 years old, in the year 1972. My father was a chariot sculptor and he taught be the basics of this art form. I have built new chariots for many temples, including the Anjaneya temple of Raagigudda in Bengaluru,” he said.
 
 “We have used six wood varieties, including sandal and teak, for the construction of the chariot. Names of all the 24 pontiffs of Suttur mutt have been carved on this chariot,” he said.
 
 The idol of Sri Shivarathreeshwara Shivayogi Mahaswamy is also installed inside the chariot. Around 24 artists worked without any break for two years to complete the work on time, he said.
 
 The chariot has been built according to the Dwaja Alaya and has five faces, he added.
 
 Another highlight of the chariot is that it has in-built hydraulic brakes, metal wheels, axle and turning system, making it safe.
 
 Two of his children,   and Yacharesh, are also now experts in the art of chariot construction.
 
 According to the mutt authorities, the chariot was inaugurated on Monday. “But it will be used for the car festival from next year,” he said.
