MUMBAI: In a major lapse, the motorman of a   (CR) Titwala-Karjat fast local jumped a signal and then “burst the point and crossing” at CSMT on Friday. Similar incidents were reported at Kurla on May 14 and   on April 21.

 
  CR has ordered a probe and suspended the motorman. A senior CR official said, “It is a serious issue as the motorman jumped the first signal soon after exiting platform 5 at 11.08am at CSMT.” He jumped the red signal at 11.11am and then “burst the point and crossing” where trains change tracks. The   train was given a red signal as the   (CSMT-Patna) was about to move on the Kalyan-bound fast track after exiting from platform 16 at 11.05am. 
 
 A source said, “Imagine if the Express too had come around the same time near that spot.” After the auxiliary warning system (AWS) brought the train to a halt, motorman S T Kishore did not realise his fault. Instead, he felt there was a flaw in the  , reset it and proceeded to “burst the point and crossing”. 
 
 In the Kurla incident, the train was detained for around 30 minutes. Usually, when the point and crossing “burst”, the train witnesses some unusual sounds along with a jerk. But the motorman continued his journey till Byculla, where he reached at 11.17am, unaware of the damage he had done. He realised his mistake when the Byculla station master alerted him over the phone. The train had by then proceeded to  , where it was terminated at 11.25am.
 
  The AWS is fitted in every local train and in the motorman’s cabin in Mumbai’s suburban system. The device, through a series of magnets and sensors, ensures the train halts immediately after jumping a red signal. The standard procedure is to “detrain” the driver and conduct his blood test to ascertain if he is under the influence of alcohol/ drugs and to question him about the cause.
