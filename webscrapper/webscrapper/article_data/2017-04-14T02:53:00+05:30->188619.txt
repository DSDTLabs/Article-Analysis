Mumbai: The city fire brigade will kick off fire safety week on Friday by showcasing the work done by its personnel on social media and by conducting a road show and an exhibition. 

 The department’s officials plan to organize interactive sessions between firemen and Mumbaikars via social media. “ The reason for getting the fire brigade on social media is to get more youngsters attracted towards the service and also have larger public involvement,” said chief fire officer P S Rahangdale. Plans are afoot to set up a Facebook page and a Twitter handle. The road show, which is being held on April 16, will start from the BMC headquarters and end at the Vikrohli command centre. Antique firefighting equipment will be on display during the road show.
