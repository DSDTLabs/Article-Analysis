Chandigarh: The Chandigarh district court on Tuesday sentenced a mother and son to eight years of jail in a dowry death case. Kanta Devi (55) and Amandeep (30), both residents of Burail were convicted under Section 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for setting ablaze 24- year-old Toni Rani alive.

 In September 2014, Toni’s father Tejpal Singh, a resident of Kurukshetra registered a case under sections 498 A, 307 and 34 of the IPC against victim’s husband Amandeep, mother –in-law Kanta Devi and father-in-law Ishwar Singh. 
 
 In his complaint Tejpal had said that he married his daughter to Amandeep in June 2014. He had also paid dowry of a value more than he could afford.
 
 However, Toni’s in-laws kept asking her for further dowry and even tortured her. He stated that they asked for a car and cash worth Rs 10 lakh.
 
 “Toni was regularly beaten up by her in-laws and he had intervened multiple times earlier to save her. 
 
 On the day of her death, she had called me and told that her in-laws have drenched her in kerosene oil on her and were burning her,” he said. Tejpal immediately left for Chandigarh along with some relatives. But on the way he was informed by a relative of the accused that his daughter has been admitted to PGIMER where she later succumbed to her burns.
 
 Defence counsel had contended that the mother-in-law was trying to save the victim, as she suffered burnt marks on her right arm and chin in the process. After hearing the arguments of both sides, the court convicted mother and son. The father Ishwar is also said to have died of burns in the incident.
