HYDERABAD: Kite business in the city has been hit with police strictly enforcing a ban on 'Chinese' manja, which was announced by the Telangana government in January, and   hitting sales.

 Patang traders in the city used to sell around 95 per cent of their entire produce in 2015. But now, it's a major struggle to sell even 50 per cent of their goods, traders say. As interest in   dwindles - with young professionals struggling for time and children preferring staying glued to gadgets - the note ban and ban on 'Chinese' manja have only compounded problems. Even though the Telangana tourism department is trying to revive kite flying by introducing the week-long International Kite festival, small time vendors like Ghouse Jani are still struggling to clear their debts, let alone earn surplus margin.
 
 While alternatives such as cot ton manja are available in the market, they are more expensive compared to the 'Chinese' one. Twelve reels of cotton manja costs around Rs1,500, while the same amount of 'Chinese' manja costs between Rs 350 to Rs 450, a reason why people continue to prefer the latter.
