 While the three-big-meals-a day is common and convenient,   time requires a slow but steady flow of energy to the body and hence, having frequent smaller meals is a good idea. “Even a slight, involuntary feeling of hunger can break the flow of study and impair concentration. Hence, avoid heavy meals during the day; opt for light fibre rich foods like fresh fruit or bhel every two hours. A little bit of dark chocolate can also be useful in feeling satiated. Avoid processed foods as they tend to make you drowsy,“ says nutritionist Dr Yogita Paranjape.
 
 
 
 
 Time management is of great importance during exams as study time needs to be intelligently interspersed with snack breaks and active recreation. Hence, you can alternate between high fibre carbs and fresh fruits or salads. Ensure your meal consists of whole grains and omega 3 rich foods such as fish, mustard oil, mustard seeds, methi, urad dal, rajma, soybeans, lobia, walnuts, bajra, and flaxseeds. Fresh fruits and vegetables are a good source of antioxidants like vitamin A, E and C which reduce brain cell damage. Choose adequate amount of fresh fruits and vegetables like amla, citrus fruits, tomatoes, green peppers, green leafy vegetables, kiwi, broccoli, and strawberries.
