NEW DELHI: Any provision of “service charge” in a food bill has no legal backing and for consumers the cost of food includes all expenses incurred by hotels and restaurants, Union minister   said on Wednesday.

 He said any charge over and above this was an “unfair trade practice” and consumers need not pay.
 
 Talking to reporters, the consumer affairs minister admitted that there were some grey areas as far as the issue is concerned as there is no definition of “service charge” in law. But taking   without consumer discretion is unfair,   said, adding that menu cards should price in the service charge. While one needs to pay  , service charge is voluntary since it’s actually a “tip” for waiters.
