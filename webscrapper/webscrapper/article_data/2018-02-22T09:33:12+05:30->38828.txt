HYDERABAD: India’s second rainwater harvesting (RWH) park will be established in Hyderabad. Large areas at Kamalapuri Colony and Butterfly Park at Jubilee Hills road no. 26 have been identified to develop the theme park. These two parks are maintained by the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC). The first rainwater harvesting park was established in Bengaluru by ‘Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage’ (BWSSB) in March 2011 on 1.5 acre open plot.

 The   government proposed to construct the theme park as part of ‘Jalam-Jeevam’ programme to promote construction of RWH pits. The motive is to create awareness among people about saving rainwater and utilising harvested water for several purposes, instead of using purified drinking water.
 
  
 The proposed RWH park will be developed with rainwater instead of tap water. GHMC and Hyderabad Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board (HMW&SB) will jointly develop this park.
 
 To take guidelines for the project, the Telangana   invited A R Shiva Kumar, principal scientific officer at the Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology, Indian Institute of Science, who designed the RWH park in Bengaluru. “He gave a presentation. He also met Municipal Administration & Urban Development minister KT Rama Rao and explained about the RWH park,” HMWS&SB director-technical, P S Suryanarayana, said.
 
 “Out of the two locations, we have chosen a park spread over 1.5 acre at Kamalapuri Colony. We have asked the principal scientific officer to prepare a detailed project report and submit it within two weeks,” Suryanarayana added.
 
 The theme park will consist a central gallery, water gallery, sewage gallery and an auditorium. Water Board aims to construct the theme park before the onset of monsoon, said a water board official.
