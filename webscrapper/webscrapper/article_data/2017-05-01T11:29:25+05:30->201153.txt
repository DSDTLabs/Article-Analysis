PANAJI: Calangute   is to be reappointed as chairman of north Goa planning and development authority (NGPDA).

 Sources said that the chief minister Manohar Parrikar has cleared Lobo’s name after the minister for town & country planning ( ) Vijai Sardesai recommended his name. Lobo was   for the last term, during which time he brought some of Calangute and Candolim under the PDA. He resigned from the post before the assembly polls.
 
 There are three PDAs in Goa – south Goa, Mormugao and the NGPDA. Chairmanship of SGPDA (South) is likely to go to a nominee of Sardesai. In 2012, then Cuncolim MLA Rajan Naik was appointed to the SGPDA but two years later, he was unceremoniously removed and replaced with then   and present panchayats minister Mauvin Godinho.
 
 It is not clear whether the Mormugao PDA will be headed by Milind Naik or whether   will be reappointed to the post.
 
 Sardesai denied that there was any dispute between him and the chief minister over appointing chairmen of the PDAs.
 
 Revenue minister Rohan Khaunte is still pursuing a proposal to bring the department of registration, which is now under law ministry, under his revenue ministry, sources said.
