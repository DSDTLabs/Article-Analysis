The protesters tried to block district magistrate BN Singh but let him go after they were assured of a dialogue with all three authority CEOs on the matter.

It was chaired by Maharaj Singh and organised by Gajendra Chaudhary and Pawan Khatana. This time the families of the farmers from all over Gautam Budh Nagar district participated in the panchayat and took part in the dharna,” said Naresh Sharma of BKU.
