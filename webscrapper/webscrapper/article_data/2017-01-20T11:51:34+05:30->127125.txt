KOCHI:   Co Pvt Ltd (KDHP) cannot use the bungalows in the property in its possession for tourism purposes as it violates legal provisions, said the state government before the high court.

 The government’s submission was in the form of a counter affidavit filed in response to a petition filed by KDHP. As per the government’s affidavit, KDHP is trying to let out around 24 bungalows in Kanan Devan Hills village for long-term to run resorts and homestays. The attempt is to let out the bungalows to three major resort groups, the affidavit said.
 
 Such a move is being made by KDHP on the assumption that Kerala Land Reforms (KLR) Act permits them to use 5% of plantations for tourism purposes, government’s affidavit said. KDHP’s efforts to let out bungalows is misconceived as the properties held by it are not exempted as per KLR Act, the government said.
 
 The properties are vested in the government as per Section 3 of Kanan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971 and restored to KDHP as per orders of state land board for plantation purposes. Thus, the bungalows are situated in government land and are owned by the government and KHDP is only lessee of the properties, government claimed.
 
 Additionally, the use of the bungalows for tourism purposes by KDHP would result in loss of crores of rupees to the government, the affidavit said. The bungalows are worth crores of rupees and their value further increases if the heritage status is considered. Allowing letting out of the bungalows would result in unjust enrichment using government properties, the affidavit stated.
 
 Through the petition, KDHP is admitting that it does not need the bungalows for plantation purposes and it should have surrendered them to the state, government alleged.
