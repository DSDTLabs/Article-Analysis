Jaipur: Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday dismissed habeas corpus petition of foreign currency smuggler with cost of Rs 50,000 for abuse of law. 

 The division bench of Justice Mohammad Rafiq and Justice Govardhan Bardhar rejected a habeas corpus petition of foreign currency smuggler Arpit Jain. Opposing the petition, additional solicitor general R D Rastogi submitted that Aprit Jain was caught on November 13, 2017 at Jaipur airport carrying foreign currency worth Rs 96.26 lakh and Indian currency of Rs 26,400. He was carrying these notes in two bags while boarding to Dubai. This is the highest recovery of foreign currency ever in Rajasthan.
 
 During the interrogation by the customs department team, he confessed that earlier also he had smuggled foreign currency worth Rs 5.89 crore since August 2017. He filed three consecutive bail applications in the high court and all them were rejected. But, he still abused the process of the court by filing the habeas corpus petition which filed against illegal detention.
 
 The contention of the petitioner of torture by the officials were brushed aside and the court held that is sheer abuse of law and dismissed the petition with a cost of Rs 50,000 to be deposited with the Legal Services Authority within one month.
