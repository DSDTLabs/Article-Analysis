Greater Noida: Even as over 30,000   reached Mumbai on Sunday to press for their demand for a complete loan waiver from the government, farmers group Kisan Sangharsh Samiti made a similar demand in Noida. 

 “We demand a complete nullification of all pending loans against farmers—be it for urea, seed or credit card loans—as returns from agriculture has not been able to suffice for farmers because of inadequate pricing of crops,” convenor of Kisan Sangharsh Samiti, Dushyant Naagar, said.
 
 A meeting has been held with All India Kisan Mahasabha in Delhi where Mumbai protests were discussed, Naagar said. “We have supported the Mumbai movement. Irrespective of the political banner, we are supporting the cause of the farmers there,” Naagar added.
 
 The farmers in Mumbai are pressing for complete loan waiver, remunerative prices for agricultural produce and implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations.
 
 “These demands are representative of farmers’ demands from all over the country. We’ve written to the Prime Minister’s Office on these issues. We’re all awaiting a resolution on these long pending issues,” Naagar added.
