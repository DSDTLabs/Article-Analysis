THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Lance  , who was found dead after a sting video on the abuse of the sahayak or buddy system in the Army, was laid to rest in Kollam district on Saturday after a fresh autopsy was conducted following the insistence of his family. 

 Mathew's family hit out at the Army and alleged that his body was laid on a trolley at the airport for nearly an hour because Armymen from   had to drape it with a national flag. They also alleged that the Army had disrespected his body. After the Kollam rural SP and district collector intervened, a second post-mortem was ordered.
