KOLKATA: Kolkata's iconic cricket venue   will be going plastic-free, thanks in large part to an environment saving initiative taken by the   (CAB) and local   franchise, Kolkata Knight Riders. 

 A company working on reducing environmental pollution has been given the responsibility to decide ways of making Eden Gardens plastic and pollution free. While the 66,000-capacity cricket stadium is a pride not only to Kolkata but also to the Indian cricket fraternity, the amount of waste that is deposited in and around the stadium after every match has raised eyebrows as to the CAB's policies. 
 
 To fight this, the CAB and   have held several meetings this IPL season. "We were trying to find out ways to combat the environmental pollution. Let's see what results we get from the initiatives we are going to implement," said the joint secretary of the CAB,  . 
 
 KKR has engaged an NGO to work on the reasons and methods to reduce pollution. The NGO was asked to give a detailed report after the IPL matches that were held at Eden Gardens. 
 
 "We have already gathered information regarding the wastes left behind in Eden Gardens. We would suggest use of paper carry bags instead of plastic carry bags. We are aiming to make it a practice to use environment friendly products inside the cricket stadium," said  , an official of the NGO. 
 
 One of the owners of KKR, actress  , added: "We are trying to make all possible attempts to make Eden pollution free. To keep the stadium clean, KKR has donated 60 dustbins."
 
 After the end of seven IPL matches, a total of 4,514 kg paper waste and 3,780 kg plastic waste has been collected from Eden Gardens.
