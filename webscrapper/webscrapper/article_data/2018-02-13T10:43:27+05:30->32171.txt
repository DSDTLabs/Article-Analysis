AGRA: After a nationwide protest by allopathic   against the draft of   Bill (NMCB), 2017, which, if passed, will allow homeopathy, Unani and Ayurveda physicians to practice around a dozen modern medicines after clearing a six-month-long  , 200   and medical students in Aligarh took out a rally in the bill's support. 
 
  Participants of the rally said they “unanimously" supported the proposed bridge course in the NMC bill and welcomed the government’s move. Rishabh Singh, an AYUSH doctor, said that the proposed bridge course would help resolve the issue of shortage of doctors in rural areas and ensure quality healthcare.
  
  Another doctor, Nawal Ur Rehman, said that MBBS doctors were scared that the bill would affect their business. “We also study modern medicines and after clearing exams, we do internships at government hospitals. This is our right,” said Rehman. He also said if their demands were not met, they would protest again at the Sansad Bhawan.
