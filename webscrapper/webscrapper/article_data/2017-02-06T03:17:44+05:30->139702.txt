GURUGRAM: On Sunday morning, residents got together for a series of events that sought to spread awareness about obstacles faced by the  , stressing on the importance of providing better public infrastructure for them, at the third edition of ‘Tour de Vision… Miles for Lives’, organised by ‘Esha – People for the Blind’.

 There was a cycle rally, performances by the visually impaired and also a ‘blind walk’. Around 130 cyclists gathered near   at 6.30 am and pedalled on Gurgaon-Faridabad road to raise funds for eye operations for the poor. Participants could choose between two distances, 25km and 50km. 
 
 “Participants cycled to raise awareness about the need for inclusive public spaces, by reaching out to their family and friends,” said Nidhi Arora, founder of Esha. 
 
 The cycle rally was followed by the Hindi play, ‘Andher Nagari Chaupat Raja’ — a satirical take on bad governance, enacted by nine visually impaired actors and directed by NAB Centre for Blind Women and Disability Studies. 
 
 “We make people disabled as we’re not sensitive enough and don’t pay attention to their needs. We need to take more effort, so they can enjoy public spaces as much as we do,” Rajesh Dhuddu, senior vice-president of Quatrro, told TOI.
 
 Later, 16 participants were blindfolded and taken on a ‘blind walk’ through Shiv Nadar School, to experience the challenges a visually-impaired person faces daily.
 
 “If we improve infrastructure for the visually-impaired, not only are we building a better society, but also positively impacting our younger generation, who’ll grow upas sensitive, humane and contributing individuals,” said Charu Kapoor, an e-learning professionaland mother of an 8-year-old girl.
