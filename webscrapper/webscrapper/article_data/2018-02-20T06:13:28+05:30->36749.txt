CHENNAI: Following six deaths in five months involving buses from   depot (II), the transport department has written to the   managing director to take action against depot authorities for alleged poor maintenance of buses.

  in its complaint on February 6 said authorities at the depot not only submitted fake repair and maintenance bills but also sold spare parts available at the facility. 
 
 Drivers operating buses from this depot in   had frequently registered complaints pertaining to faulty air brakes and lack of major repair works undertaken, said state president of the union V Thalapathy. “Instead, others drivers in the depot were used to operate these ill-maintained buses,” he said. 
 
 Buses were allegedly operated along routes without permission from the transport department. This was in gross violation of Rule 249 of the Tamil Nadu Motor Vehicle Act, 1989 and it attracts a penalty of Rs 2,500 for the first instance and Rs 5,000 for subsequent violations. 
 
 On receiving this complaint, the state transport department has instructed MTC to take appropriate action and submit a copy of steps taken in this regard to the department. 
 
 Besides the six fatalities, buses from the depot were involved in a series of non-fatal accidents causing serious damage to public properties.
