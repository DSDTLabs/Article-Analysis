NEW DELHI: A 34-year-old   was beaten up by a group of men in an incident of   outside an eatery in  . The man told the cops that the attackers had accused him of staring at them with suspicion, which led to an argument and the assault. The men also fled with his wallet.

 In his complaint, the lawyer told the cops that the incident happened near a food stall at the outer circle. He had gone with his friend to have food when they spotted a group of men moving suspiciously among the crowd outside the shop.
 
 “I looked at the men as they seemed drunk and were carrying some sort of weapon with them. But I didn’t confront them, nor did I say anything to anyone. However, one of them suddenly spotted me and started accusing me of staring at them,” the lawyer said in his complaint.
 
 When he did not reply to the man who had started hurling abuses at him, the group of men surrounded the lawyer. When he tried to reason out with them, he was pinned down and beaten until some locals came to their rescue.
 
 The lawyer said that he had approached a PCR van parked nearby and tried to register a complaint, but the cops first asked him to log a complaint with the 100. By the time the PCR had received the call and reached the spot, the accused had fled.
 
 A case was registered at the Connaught Place police station. The lawyer’s friend had clicked a video of the accused during the assault which the cops are analysing to identify them.
