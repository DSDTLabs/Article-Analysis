HYDERABAD: Riding on Tian Houwei’s brilliant victory,   qualified for the semifinals of the   tournament at the Gachibowli Indoor Stadium on Wednesday. In the do-or-die contest, Delhi defeated   4-1 to book their spot in the last four.

 
 With Delhi’s victory, the last league encounter on Thursday between hosts Hyderabad Hunters and Bengaluru Blasters became inconsequential as both the teams along with Ahmedabad Smash Masters made it to the knockout stage.
 
 Houwei dealt a telling blow on North Eastern Warriors by defeating Tzu Wei Wang 15-10, 8-15, 15-11. The teams were locked 1-1 before this match and Houwei’s victory was significant as it happened to be the Trump match for his opponent. After Houwei’s win the points became 2-0 as North Eastern Warriors were penalised with a minus point for losing their Trump.
 
 Trailing 2-8 in the third game Houwei made a great comeback. The Chinese shuttler raised his game at the crucial juncture and with a string of powerful smashes he wiped off the deficit and caught up with Wang at 10-10. As the nervous Wang began making mistakes Houwei powered ahead to win the game at 15-11.
 
 Later, in the Trump match for Delhi, former world No. 2 Ji Hyun Sung fought back after losing the first game to get past Michelle Li13-15, 15-11, 15-13. With Sung securing two valuable points Delhi attained an unassaible lead of 4-0 and thereby took their total tally to15 points in the tournament.
 
 Sung, who was expected to easily defeat Li, struggled throughout the contest. Unable to retrieve Li’s powerful smashes, Sung lost the closely fought first game.
 
 But the Korean got back her rhythm and clinched the second game without much difficulty. It was a seesaw contest in the decider as both players got involved in long rallies.
