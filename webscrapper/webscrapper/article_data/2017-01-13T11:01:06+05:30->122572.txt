KOLKATA: City boy  , currently a student of IISc Bangalore, scored a perfect grade in three out of four examinations organized by the Educational Test Service, which conducts SAT,   and  . 

 In SAT 2 (subject test), which comprises mathematics 2, physics and chemistry, the 20-year-old scored a perfect 800. In TOEFL iBT, he secured 120/120 and in GRE as well, Agarwal clocked 100%, scoring 340. 
 
  “I wasn’t prepared. I wanted to take the exam this summer as the semester break would’ve given me three months for preparation. My father, however, wanted me take the winter test for experience.”
 
 He added, “I reached Kolkata on December 16 and had my GRE on December 22. I hardly got the time to prepare. I took a few mock tests and flipped through the official GRE guidebook from ETS and a few Manhattan GRE workbooks.”
 
 Agarwal, an alumnus of St James School, has plans to pursue PhD in theoretical computer science. “USA is my first preference. It has the best faculty and facilities in my line of study. I can get good mentors and funding for my research there. I have plans to take a look at premier universities in Canada as well.” 
 
 Agarwal may also apply in  ,   in Singapore and some   to be on the safer side. 
 
 Agarwal was confident that quantitative reasoning section will give him an edge over others. “Since I am majoring in mathematics from IISc, I expected a perfect score in quantitative reasoning. Verbal reasoning can be a bit tricky at times. I was also getting close to 168-169 in mock tests. Securing a perfect score in the verbal reasoning section was satisfying,” added Ishan. 
 
 He advised his juniors not to be afraid of quantitative reasoning if they are majoring in maths. Agarwal suggests that students should take more mock tests to get the idea of their strengths and weaknesses. 
 
  The achiever feels that there is no better way to prepare for verbal than reading good old classic novels and even books by other good authors.
