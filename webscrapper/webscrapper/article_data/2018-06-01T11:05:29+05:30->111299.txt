LUCKNOW: Can hiccups become an obstacle to   or can a   be taken during the fasting duration? Can the therapeutic alternative medicine procedure of Hijama or wet cupping be followed by a rozedar? What about those who use dentures? 

 The answer to all these queries is that none of them affects a person's roza.
 
  Questions related to health and other areas while observing a fast have flocked both Shia and Sunni   helplines being run by clerics for the ease and awareness of Muslims fasting in this month. 
 
 With the Islamic Centre of India running an exclusive helpline-where questions are answered by a team of clerics led by   Mahali-a number of calls during the first 15 days of Ramzan were related to health. 
 
 "One question that often comes to the helplines is about blood tests or any external medical procedure. It is absolutely fine to get those done," said  , who runs the Shia Ramzan helpline. 
 
  "In fact, it is good that people ask questions, as our answers help others who might have such confusion," he added. 
 
 Other questions that came to the helplines included one about an epilepsy fit affecting a roza. The answer to this was that if there is blood inside the mouth during a fast, it should not be swallowed and the roza would be maintained. 
 
 A pregnant woman and a physically or mentally unwell person are also exempted from observing a roza. A woman who is breastfeeding also comes under an exceptional case if she fears compromise in the nutrition to her child. 
 
 In this case, the woman has to cover up for the lost out rozas later.
