SURAT: The four-day gems and jewellery exhibition- Sparkle-2017-was inaugurated by   at Surat International Exhibition and Convention Centre (SIECC) at Sarsana here on Thursday. 

 The deputy chief minister lauded the exhibitors for taking part in the event organized by   (SGCCI) and sponsored by state government, which had lost some lustre because of demonetization and shortage of new currency. 
 
 “Sparkle is part of Vibrant Gujarat celebrations and it is going to be a huge success. I would request people to visit the show and be a part of the ‘Make In India’ dream of Prime Minister  . Surat is the economic capital of Gujarat and in the coming days, people of this vibrant city will get metro rail project,” Patel said.
 
 The number of exhibitors was less than 50 until last week but the SGCCI’s gems and jewellery committee managed to get 105 exhibitors from Surat, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Jaipur, Valsad, Khambhat and Rajkot before the event began.
 
 The gems and jewellery exhibition from January 19 to 22 is being held in 1,000 square meter area with the attraction being the 22-foot replica of Shivlingam of Somnath Temple which is studded with 75,000 diamonds and coated with gold. 
 
 SGCCI president BS Agarwal said, “Demonetization has affected the Sparkle event, but we have managed to get comfortable presence of exhibitors. We had to cancel the entire B2B event where around 35 exhibitors had confirmed participation before demonetization. We have invited around 22 guests from Kenya and a Dubai-based jewellery company will be doing branding at the show.”
 
 Agarwal informed that a series of seminars will be held on January 19, 20 and 21 by   on diamond jewellery sector. Also, a fashion show will be organized to display latest jewellery designs in the country.
