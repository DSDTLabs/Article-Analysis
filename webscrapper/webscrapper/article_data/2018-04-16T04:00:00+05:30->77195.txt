Palanpur: More than 200 birds including sparrows, parrots, cuckoo, pigeons, ring collar dove, titar and other common birds succumbed to mysterious disease in less than one month in Kamoda village of Lakhni taluka of Banaskantha. 

 Wildlife activist Manu Ashanani said, “I came to know about this on Friday when a primary school teacher in the village informed me that the birds regularly die almost every day after falling ill.” 
 
 “We have given two ring coll-ar doves including one dead one to veterinary officer in Deesa for probe who later sent the bir-ds to Sardar Krushinagar Dantiwada Agricultural University for pathological test,” said range forest officer, Deesa, J G Modi. Ashanani said the disease might have developed due to scarcity of water for birds. tnn
