CHENNAI: Proliferation of Tasmac liquor vending outlets is affecting Southern Railway's mission to curb train run-over deaths. 

  (RPF) has conducted a detailed recce and found that 14 key locations in Chennai's suburban network, where train run-over cases are high, have liquor shops in close proximity to the railway tracks and station.
 
 The RPF has written to Tasmac requesting to relocate these 14 outlets to places away from the railway installations.
 
 RPF personnel on the field say that railway tracks have become bars at some locations, especially   and Saidapet. "People bring their drinks and glass and sit on the tracks, blissfully unaware that trains might run them over," an RPF source said.
 
 Also, after drinks, people come to the railway station causing nuisance to other passengers. Worse, there have been cases where people in an inebriated state travel on train footboard and fall to death from moving train.
 
 Three letters were written in June, November and December in this connection, said senior divisional security commissioner  , who heads the RPF of Chennai division.
 
 The areas identified are Perungalathur, Vandalur, Urapakkam, Guduvancherry, Palavanthangal, Saidapet, Vyasarpadi, Villivakkam, Ambattur, Annanur, Thirumailai MRTS, Perungudi MRTS, Gummidipundi and Jolarpettai.
 
 Commuters have complained to local station masters at the two MRTS stations and Saidapet regarding inebriated men lurking in dark corners of the station. One can find a number of discarded glass bottles on foot over bridges at these stations.
 
 "It's a good step, but RPF should also increase its vigil at such stations," said C Srinivasan, who commutes to Tambaram from Guindy every day.
