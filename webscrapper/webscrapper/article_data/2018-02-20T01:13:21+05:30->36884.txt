GURUGRAM: Following repeated complaints by the management and students of   in Badshapur, MCG on Monday cleared the sewage water pooled at the entrance of the school. TOI had reported on February 18 that students and teachers had to wade through the sewage to enter the school. The pool of water was a grave threat due to the presence of few electricity poles.

 Anuradha Sharma, the principal, said, “For the past 15 days, we had to tolerate the stink from the water collected right outside the school gates. Students had to wade through the sewage water barefooted to enter inside the school. The water was finally cleared on Monday morning. I feel this is an impact of a TOI story. I only hope MCG has found a permanent solution to this problem and this is not a temporary solution.” The school authorities said a permanent solution needs to be found, as water regularly collected in front of their school.
 
 “We acted on the complaints of the school kids. We didn’t want them to cross the sewage water collected outside the school,” said  , MCG’s executive engineer water supply and sewerage (WSS) Zone III&IV. 
 
 “We have shut the open line through which the water was flowing out. There is a major   drain right in front of the school. I am hopeful that this issue won’t reoccur. We will hold meetings with the NHAI officials soon to ensure that the water is not collected again and the drain is cleaned on time. Effective measures were taken and officials were pressed into action immediately seeing the severity of the case.”
