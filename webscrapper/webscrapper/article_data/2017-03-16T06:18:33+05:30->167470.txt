AHMEDABAD:   (15) was beside herself with regret that she could not answer questions worth 10 marks in the English paper of her   on Wednesday. 

 The courageous girl, who has just one finger on each of her hands, refused to use a writer, but did not know her confidence in being able to write her own paper would cause her to be denied the extra half an hour generally given to children with disabilities.
 
 “Children who opt for writers are given half an hour extra to write their papers. Mittal was never told that she would not get the extra time if she did not take a writer. We are going to represent her case before the  , that she should be lauded for her bravery and not punished for not using a writer,” said Ram Kumar, Mittal’s father.
 
 Mittal is a SSC student of Isanpur-based Divine Buds School. She was born with congenital birth defects, with her hands not having five fingers but just one big finger each. The disability affects her feet as well.
 
 Generally, disabled students are offered writers but as Mittal clutches the pen with her two fingers and writes, she decided to take the exams without the crutch of a writer. Her   said that she is disabled but she was not guided by the school about securing the half hour extra from the  .
