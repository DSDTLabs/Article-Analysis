'Beyond The Clouds' is Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi’s maiden, India-set project. The film, starring Shahid Kapoor’s younger brother   and  , is a sensitive story about life in the slums.
 
 AR Rahman helms this album of 15 tracks and what we get to hear is some really sound music with top-notch instrumentalists. Of these, two are songs and the rest are mostly western classical scores — each with its own story attached to it.
 
 The first song, 'Ala Re Ala' is an upbeat track that has a fun rap, a generous dose of drums, dhols and some fab, festive and steady beats. The much spirited music with its strong backing of desi, street percussion is an earworm for sure.
 
 The next, 'Ey Chhote Motor Chala' has been sung by Dilshaad Shabbir Shaikh, Nikhita Gandhi with rap by MC Heam. It has snatches of local Indian music that has been blended with hip hop genre.
 
 ‘Beyond The Clouds’ is the movie’s theme music. This beautiful composition begins with a heart-touching hum by Nikhita and then goes on to a piano strings piece. Nikhita’s voice range can be fathomed from her earlier renditions ‘Raabta’ (Raabta), ‘Ullu Ka Pattha’ (Jagga Jasoos) and the beautifully sung track ‘Ghar’ (Jab Harry Met Sejal). She does perfect justice to ‘Beyond The Clouds’ too.
 
 Rahman’s score for this film is replete with a tad bit overused orchestral compositions, that are invariably reminiscent of his earlier creations.
