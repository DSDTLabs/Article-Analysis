KOLKATA: The spate of accidents in the city in the past three days has forced   to rethink its strategies on Kolkata roads. The traffic cops have decided to deploy civic volunteers and ask the local police to pitch in as well to ensure pedestrians cross important roads like EM Bypass and   in a systematic manner and buses do not pick up or drop off passengers in the middle of the road.

 Sources said the main thrust of this drive will be to bring down accidents on major roads like EM Bypass, AJC Bose Road, APC Road and DH Road. “These are big stretches and have several intersections. We will be launching a special drive against jaywalking and illegal cycling if required,” said an officer. For the time being, cops are carrying out road furniture surveys to ensure maximum protection for pedestrians. Kolkata witnesses a huge number of pedestrian deaths each year, one of the highest in the country.
 
 
  
 
 According to DC (traffic) Sumit  , the police will deploy around 1,200 civic volunteers at all important crossings — around 60 sites have been chosen in the first phase. “Their main job will be to ensure that pedestrians do not cross the roads from different points. They will also ensure that all passengers get on and off buses from one spot,” said Kumar.
 
 Lalbazar sources said the local police station sergeant and constables will also ensure no bus stops in the middle of the road. “The chase-andbooking system will be optimized,” said an officer from the planning section.
 
 Kumar added that they have found merit in claims from certain bus drivers and bus owners that not all accidents involving their vehicles can be attributed to the fault of drivers.
 
 “Honouring the merit of their claim, we will now send SMSs to drivers immediately informing them about any violation they commit. We are encouraging them to do better. A reward system will also be started. But those who are found guilty of gross violations will have to face the music,” said Kumar.
