RAJKOT: The city police arrested a college student who abducted a man from Mitana village in Tankara taluka of Morbi district on Tuesday.

 The 20-year-old accused  , a resident of Gokulnagar on  , had abducted   whom he had lent Rs 1.8 lakh seven months ago. 
 
 Tankara police informed the city police that Vijay would be coming to Saint Kabir Road in a car. Police kept a watch and intercepted car and found Bharvad and Gajera inside. They detained Bharvad and rescued Gajera. During questioning, Vijay revealed the name of   Bharvad who was also involved in the abduction. 
 
 Nikhil’s father Ramesh Gajera had lodged a complaint against Bharvad alleging that he had abducted his son. Nikhil was earlier living in Rajkot and came in contact with Vijay. However, Nikhil shifted to Mitana village later. He had borrowed Rs 1.8 lakh from Bharvad seven months ago. However, Vijay used to threaten him as Nikhil could not pay the instalment regularly. 
 
 On Tuesday, Bharvad and Ragho went to Nikhil’s house for recovery but the latter told them he does not have money. This angered Bharvad and they abducted him from Mitana. Bharvad has been handed over to Tankara police for further probe while search is on for Ragho.
