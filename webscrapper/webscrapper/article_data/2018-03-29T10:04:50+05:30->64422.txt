GUWAHATI: After   urged the state leadership to reconsider its decision to contest the panchayat election alone, party leaders said they might review the decision after March 31. 

 "We will see whether we will go it alone in the panchayat election or with alliance partners only after March 31. At present, we have not taken any decision on   and AGP contesting the election together," BJP general secretary   said when asked if the party has changed its stand on the matter.
 
 BJP had earlier announced that it will fight the panchayat election on its own, without its partners in the ruling coalition AGP and BJP. 
 
 Party insiders said its policy decision committee will meet on March 31, when all aspects of conducting the panchayat election will be taken up. The rural polls are expected to lay the groundwork for the   election next year. The schedule of the panchayat election has not been announced yet, but is expected to be out soon.
