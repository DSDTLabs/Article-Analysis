For as long as   has been active on the scene, he has been synonymous with fancy cars and bikes. His garage, from the time he became an actor, has flaunted some of the best four and two-wheelers in the world. And to make his   on Dutt look authentic, director Rajkumar Hirani has thoroughly researched and put his team to source a few of the vehicles owned by him in his early days.

 “The film is Sanjay’s journey. Apart from the numerous ups and downs, it also dwells on his evolution from a young, flamboyant lad to a man who loves his luxurious rides and spends on them religiously. Sanjay’s love for vehicles hasn’t dwindled in all these years and it has to be portrayed to show the flashy lifestyle he has had. Raju has assigned a few members of his core team to source a few, if not all, of the vehicles Sanjay once owned from old car sellers or owners. The idea is to either show   zipping around in them or to show them parked in his garage, giving an idea of his lifestyle.” 
 
 For those who have tuned in late, Ranbir plays Sanjay Dutt in the biopic on the actor. The film went on floors in January this year.
