 The task force, appointed by the state government, which probed the issue recommended police investigation against former Serilingampally  , who was in charge of the area in 2012.

 According to a task force report, the tehsildar helped one Endla Tirupathamma in getting the prime land at Raidurg (Panmakhta) in 2012.
 
 “The fraud started in April 2012 wherein Tirupathamma submitted an application to the Serilingampally tehsildar enclosing uncertified photocopies of Pahani for several years including Khasra Pahani, a revenue record, of 1954-55 and copies of tenancy certificates stating she was the sole legal heir and successor of original protected tenant of the land, Endla Chinna Narasimha. But our inquiry revealed that there were no names of Endla family in the Khasra Pahani and the total area of 525 acres patta land in Survey No 83 was in the name of a Muslim family,” SK Sinha, who headed the Task Force till recently, told TOI.
 
 When contacted, Ranga Reddy district collector M Raghunandan Rao said action would be taken once they get directions from the government. “The district administration is in the possession of 470 acres in Raidurg,” he said.
