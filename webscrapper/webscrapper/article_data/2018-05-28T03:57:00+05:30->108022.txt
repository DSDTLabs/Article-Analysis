Patna: The state government on Sunday sacked Bihar Museum’s additional director Jai Prakash Narayan Singh after he allegedly thrashed museum director Yusuf in his official chamber following a dispute over a file related to recruitment of a person.

 After an immediate inquiry conducted by department’s additional secretary, Singh’s conduct was found to be unbecoming of an officer, art, culture and youth department principal secretary Chaitanya Prasad told TOI over the phone. “The decision has been taken to terminate his contract with immediate effect,” Prasad said.
 
 He said there was difference of opinion between Singh and the director over a file and the former thrashed Yusuf inside his chamber. “Singh was associated with   for almost one-and-a-half years while Yusuf had joined as its director almost six months back,” he said. Prasad also said Singh had four months of the contract period left.
 
 Kotwali police station SHO Ram Shankar said the museum employees informed the police and Yusuf was taken to New Gardiner Road Hospital for first aid as he was bleeding. The SHO said Yusuf had received injuries on his face as his spectacles were broken in the scuffle. “The director, in his FIR, has alleged that Singh punched his face and thrashed him with a chair,” the SHO said.
 
 DSP (law and order) Shibli Nomani said Yusuf accused Singh of pressurising him to make a comment on the file in such a way that it is passed without any hassle, but the director refused to do so.
 
 Yusuf could not be contacted as he did not pick up the TOI call.
 
 Singh, however, refuted all charges against him and said after the differences over the file, he had walked out of Yusuf’s chamber. “Yusuf was pressuring me to change a note in the file related to a recruitment that the director can fix pay. I had asked him to take permission from principal secretary in this regard,” he added.
