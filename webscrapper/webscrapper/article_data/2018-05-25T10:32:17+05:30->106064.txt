 JAIPUR: In an unprecedented manner the syndicate meetings of the Rajasthan   is being held almost every day for opening envelopes of the selected candidates of the subject concerned. This has burdened the university financially and also affected seniority level of the candidates appointed.
 
 For one syndicate meeting a member is paid Rs. 2000 excluding the travel allowance given to the members travelling from outside. In total for one meeting Rs. 60000-Rs. 80000 is spent every day (for 18 members) which can be avoided by holding one meeting at last to open all the envelops. Another important issue, the selected candidates of different subjects are given different joining dates which down the years will affect the seniority level of the candidates either for selection of the dean, head of the department or getting a house allotment.
 
 
 Registrar of the   said, “At present our focus is appointments as there are vacant posts in the University that is affecting the students.”
