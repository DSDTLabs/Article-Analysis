PUNE: The death of a pregnant woman, who had to be rushed to   from   due to non-availability of a doctor, has brought the poor condition of the civic health department into focus.

 On March 22, a 20-year-old pregnant woman from Vishrantwadi suffered convulsions and was rushed to Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada run by the   ( ). However, she did not get immediate attention as there was no medical officer present. She was then moved to the state-run Sassoon General Hospital, where she succumbed to complications soon after. 
 
 A complaint of medical negligence was filed with the PMC’s health department, following which the medical officer Vijay Bade, of Rajiv Gandhi Hospital was suspended on Monday.
 
 The issue of vacancies was raised during PMC’s general body meeting on Monday. “Patients, who usually seek medical treatment at civic hospitals, represent the financially weaker sections of the society. They rely on and trust these services. But their trust has been breached by the poor performance of the health department,” said corporators.
 
 The PMC officials explained that the process to recruit staff was underway. As of now, 512 posts, including that of physicians, radiologists, ophthalmologists and ENT surgeons, are vacant in the department. 
 
 “A couple of years ago, the civic body had increased the remuneration for doctors after it received a poor response to its advertisements. The department has urged the state government for permanent recruitment of doctors,” said a senior PMC official.
