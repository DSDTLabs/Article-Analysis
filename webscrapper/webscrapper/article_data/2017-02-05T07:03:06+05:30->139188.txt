KOLKATA: No one knows who is right, but the fact remains that the Manoj Kumar-Subhra Kundu sub-plot in the   case has muddled the investigation into the  . 

  is yet to provide Enforcement Directorate with substantive evidence of the alleged Rs 15 crore transfer of funds from Rose Valley account to Subhra’s account under Kumar’s guidance — a charge, if proved true, might cost his job. Trinamool, on the other hand, has been harping on the issue to show what kind of officers in central agencies are entrusted with the probe in which Trinamool Lok Sabha leader   has been made a victim. 
 
 Subhra on Friday questioned the authenticity of the Madam Rose Valley file during questioning by the ED. She told ED officials that she had doubts about the two files — Rose Valley and Madam Rose Valley. Sources said Subhra went on record saying that no detail of such files was mentioned to her by Kolkata Police. She has also told ED officials that during the interrogation in the last two days, Kolkata Police STF team did not ask her about any money transfer to her accounts. She herself has asked Kolkata Police officers at Lalbazar about the two files being spoken about in the media. “The Kolkata Police’s allegations against Manoj Kumar rest on Rs 15 crore which Subhra has allegedly laundered under Kumar’s guidance. Two days after we have sought details of the payments, police are yet to respond,” said an ED official.
 
 Earlier on Friday, ED sent a letter to Kolkata Police seeking details of the case and the CCTV footages from the NSCBI Airport and a Sundernagar hotel in Delhi. While the footages are still awaited, ED has sent a reminder to Lalbazar on Saturday. Meanwhile, the anti-corruption branch of CBI has said that they can take up the case only when it is referred to them by the ED.
