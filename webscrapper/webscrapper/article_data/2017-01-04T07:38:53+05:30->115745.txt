NEW DELHI: Amid controversial comments from politicians on cases of sexual harassment in Bengaluru, Congress said on Tuesday that freedom of choice of women was absolute and it was duty of the state to protect it.

 AICC spokesman   said, “If hooligans run riot on  , it does not mean that young women need to stay at home. It means that ho oligans need to go to jail.“
 
 “Women are equal to men in every respect and have the right to wear whatever dress they deem appropriate and to go out at whate ver time they feel app ropriate. Ensuring the ir safety is the respon sibility of the state and it cannot absolve itself of that responsibility by saying that women need to be cautious in the way they dress,“ Tewari said.
