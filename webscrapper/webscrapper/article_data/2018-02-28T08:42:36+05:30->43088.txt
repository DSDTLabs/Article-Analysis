MUMBAI: India’s cricketers could soon witness some acche din. “Players across the board - the Indian men’s team, the national women’s’ side, the domestic and even the junior (India under-19) cricketers are set for a big pay hike soon. This has almost been finalised,” a top   ( ) official told TOI after attending a meeting of the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) here on Tuesday.

 
 
 
 “Before the Indian team leaves for Sri Lanka for the Nidahas Trophy, around 25 cricketers, divided in three categories (A, B & C) will receive their annual contracts. We waited for the finance committee to approve this pay rise, but it has neither met nor reverted to us on the issue. We need to give the contracts to the players before the IPL, as we need to insure them in case they miss any matches in the league due to an injury picked up on national duty,” he said.
 
 While he refused to divulge the new salary structure, the official was quick to dismiss speculation that those cricketers who have Grade ‘A’ contracts could be paid around Rs 12 crore a year. The gradation of the cricketers will be decided by the national selection committee led by  .

It is learnt that the legal status of the office-bearers, five elected vice-presidents and the committees could come under scrutiny post-March 1.
