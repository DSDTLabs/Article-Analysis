CHENNAI: Everyone in the room had a story to tell - a successful professional struggling to find a spouse, a child who refused to go to school because she was bullied, a 30-year-old who gave up a dream job. And epilepsy was the thread running through these narratives. 

 On Monday, on the occasion of  , families of those suffering from the   came together to launch a  , hoping to fight the stigma associated with the ailment.
 
 Although there are a handful of support groups for patients with epilepsy, the scene in Chennai is blurry. "We have some international experts to treat the condition medically, but few to salve the social wounds inflicted on patients and their families," said Dhananjayan B, whose 16-year-old daughter Anisha suffered from epilepsy for 13 years before undergoing a surgery recently. "From getting admission in schools to finding the right doctor for treatment, it was a struggle for us right through," he recalled. Anisha is now a class XI student in a regular school. Her story instilled hope.
 
 According to WHO, India has around 12 million people suffering from epilepsy. While this number contributes to one-fifth of the global statistic, the number of people availing themselves of treatment for epilepsy in India is sparse. 
 
 Only around 60% of patients from urban areas seek treatment, and 20-40% from rural pockets.
 
 This could be because of lack of awareness, especially in rural areas, about the treatment options available. Stigma too prevents people from reaching out for help.
 
 Dr Dinesh Nayak, senior neurologist and epileptologist, Fortis Malar Hospital that helped launch the support group, explained the treatment options open for these patients. "Medical treatment is very effective in controlling seizures. Seizures in about 70-80% of children and young adults with epilepsy can be well controlled with medication alone. Some of the patients with uncontrolled epilepsy can be candidates for brain surgery to cure epilepsy," he said.
