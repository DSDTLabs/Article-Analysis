AHMEDABAD: It’s not just the   that would now on be the only source for investigating agencies, with 1.5 crore digital transactions taking place everyday in India, the digital money trail also now plays a major role to understand a suspect’s routine and major deviations.

 Gujarat state anti-corruption bureau ( ) had invited Bharat Panchal, head, risk management, for National Payments Corporation of India ( ) on Friday for a one-day workshop on   and how investigating agencies can use the information in a probe. ACB’s senior officials along with field staff participated in the workshop.
 
 Keshav Kumar, special director, ACB, told TOI that the idea was to broaden the concept of money trail for the officers. “The training would go a long way in improving the investigations and understanding a person’s economic profile,” he said.
 
 ACB officials said that the concept might come handy primarily while probing disproportionate assets (DA) cases. “In many cases, lack of information on a person’s active bank accounts and transaction behaviour doesn’t give the full picture. The digital transactions, including mobile banking and netbanking, now have a large share and with the recent demonetization move, the money, even if taken as bribe, will enter sooner or later in the mainstream. The knowledge will help identify such avenues related to specific cases,” said a senior ACB official.
 
 Panchal in his speech said that in the past 15 years, there has been 300% rise in digital transactions and main vehicles nowadays are smartphones, he added.
