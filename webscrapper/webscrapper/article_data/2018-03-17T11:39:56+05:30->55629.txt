  : As many as 40 children of   village in   block in   district were admitted to the local community health centre on Thursday evening after they ate 'tikki chat' (snack) prepared by a roadside vendor. 

 Doctors attending to them said that they were out of danger and most of them were discharged on Friday morning. The district administration has seized the snacks and sent samples to a laboratory for testing.
 
 According to villagers, barely half an hour after consuming the snack, children started complaining of a stomachache and vomiting. The villagers were taken by surprise with so many children falling ill suddenly. 
 
 They took the children to the CHC in Jalalabad in an ambulance. A villager,  , said, "Children have been eating snacks here for a long time but this is the first time when they were taken ill. Everyone in the village was scared after such a large number of children fell ill."
 
 Emergency medical officer Dr   said, "Forty children were brought to the CHC for treatment. The man who made the snack blamed the shopkeeper for selling him stale ingredients which led to the children falling ill. I informed the sub divisional magistrate about the incident. He visited the CHC and village. The condition were discharged on Friday morning after their condition improved."
 
 Dhirendra Pratap Singh, designated officer, food safety drug administration, said, "We have taken samples of the snack and sent it to a laboratory in Lucknow for testing. The report will arrive within 10 days. Doctors at CHC told me that the children contracted some bacterial infection because either the ingredients or water used for preparing the snack was contaminated. Besides, as the weather has become hot, the snack may have spoiled."
