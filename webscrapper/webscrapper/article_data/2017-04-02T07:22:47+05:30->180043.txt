LUCKNOW: With BJP in power both at the Centre and in the state, Jal Nigam’s dream to build an independent   (STP) on Lucknow’s biggest drain, Ghiyasuddin Haider (GH) Canal, seems to be back on track. The reason being that   had asked the Centre for about Rs 400 crore from   to build this STP. 

 This STP, of about 120 million litres daily (MLD) capacity, will cater to a population of 10 lakh in over a dozen localities like Rajajipuram, Rajendranagar, Charbagh, Mawaiya, Krishnanagar and Singarnagar. Sewage of these colonies has been flowing directly into Gomti and polluting its water.
 
 The earlier state government had sanctioned this project in October last year but released only about Rs 10 crore for its initial construction. When the tender was floated, contractors quoted close to Rs 400 crore for constructing it. Jal Nigam’s official in charge said, “This amount is too high for the state government to bear. Hence we have forwarded the proposal to the Centre for funds under the Namami Gange project. Since we now have a BJP government in state,   is hopeful that the Union Government will release that kind of funds for UP.”
 
 The city presently has only two STPs – Bharwara (345 MLD) and Daulatganj (56 MLD). But it produces over 600 million litres of sewage daily (MLD) of which only 401 is treated while the rest flows into Gomti. Jal Nigam estimates that over the next 15 years, the sewage discharge from Gomti will grow to about 1,000 MLD for which the city needs to prepare from now. It has proposed various STPs at locations like Sultanpur Road, Faizullaganj, Gomtinagar Extension and GH Canal etc.
