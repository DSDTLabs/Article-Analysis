KOLKATA: A 17-year-old boy on Monday was killed in an accident after his bike’s handle got entangled in cables hanging loosely on Park Circus bridge no. 4.

 Victim Md  , a Class XI student, was not wearing a helmet and did not have a licence. He was headed to a relative’s place in Topsia on his father’s bike when the accident occurred around 7.15am.
 
 Police registered a case of death due to negligence against unknown suspects and are looking for the cable TV operator for the area to question him. After the incident, locals blocked the road alleging police inaction concerning multiple accidents in the area due to the loose cables. They calmed only after the cops cut all the loose cables in the area. The protesters said most of these are cable TV wires and defunct telephone lines.
 
 Witnesses said  , a   resident, was riding on the lower slope of the bridge near the median divider when his bike handle got entangled in the cables hanging from a lamp post. An auto driver  , said, “His head banged against the median wall and he fell on the road. We rushed to help the profusely bleeding boy, but he was already dead.”
 
 “The wires were hanging dangerously in some areas. We have now cut all such wires. However, the boy was riding rashly. Had he worn a helmet, his life could have been saved,” an officer of   police station said.
 
 TOI visited the place later and found clusters of loose wires across several areas of Park Circus, such as in Darga Road and near Lohapool.
