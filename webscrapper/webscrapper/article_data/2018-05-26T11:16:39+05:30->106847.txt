TRICHY: Though there aren’t any concrete evidences available to determine if the prevalence of blindness among children has decreased in the district, a few available data suggests that the number of children with blindness/ partial blindness may have come down to a certain extent.

 According to sources at Sarva Sikshya Abhiyan ( ), the strength of blind or partially blind students across all schools in the district dipped to 156 in the academic year 2017-18 from 172 in the academic year 2016-17. “The number of blind children, compared to a decade ago, has decreased significantly. Based on our last field visit, not more than 10 children below the age of five are blind in the district – this is a big indicator that the prevalence of blindness has come down in the district,” the source claimed.
 
 But on the other hand, officials from the   (DBCS) and ophthalmologists stated that it was very tough to determine the prevalence of blindness among children without proper data. According to the professor and head, department of ophthalmology, K A P  , Dr R Parthiban Purushothaman, awareness about blindness and eyesight issues had increased and children were being treated in a more effective manner through early intervention. “The children, who have squint or other congenital disorders, through state government's early intervention programme, are being referred to us at an early age nowadays. Also, early treatment is very important, especially for those with conditions like refractive error,” he said.
 
 On the other hand, DBCS district programme manager in-charge, T  , said that diagnosis of children with conditions like retinopathy was done even during birth and laser treatment was given as soon as possible. “The best way to treat blindness or eye issues is through early intervention,” she added.
