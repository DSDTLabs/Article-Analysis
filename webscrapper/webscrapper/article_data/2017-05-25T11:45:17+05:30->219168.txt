"My party will discuss and finalise its stand on whom to support in the President's election at the meeting on May 27. I have great respect for Prime Minister  . However, at this juncture, I will not announce my party's support to the   candidate as I am 'deeply pained' by Amit Shah's comments," KCR said at a press conference here. 

 When requested to elaborate his party's stand in the   election, KCR said: "We have not yet taken any decision. We will do so on May 27. We believe in federal cooperation and will not act in haste. But whoever criticizes Telangana becomes my enemy and the state will not forgive them," said the CM.
 
 TRS has 17 MPs and 82 MLAs in its kitty and commands a vote strength of 22,048 in the Presidential election. Of the total electoral college, TRS has a strength of 1.9 per cent and can bring the NDA candidate closer to victory. At present, the NDA is short of 25,354 votes and if the TRS backs its candidate, then it would require only 3,306 votes that it can easily manage from other regional parties.
 
 Top sources in the TRS party reacted cautiously on the Presidential election in the backdrop of the comments made by Amit Shah on 'bad governance' in Telangana. While stating there would be no change in the party's stand to support the NDA candidate, the party is of the feeling that Amit Shah should set 'himself right' with regard to his comments against Telangana in order to resolve the unnecessary friction between the two parties.
 
 "Our leader has great regard for the Prime Minister and had extended his full support after demonetization when all other political parties were opposing it. However, the comments of Amit Shah has created an uneasy situation," roads and buildings minister   told TOI.
