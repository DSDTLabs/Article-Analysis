PATNA: The Patna high court on Wednesday rapped the   police and ordered it to immediately rescue minor boy Anshu Kumar, who was kidnapped on September 29, 2016.

 The child was eight years old when he was kidnapped while playing in front of his house at Bettiah, the district HQ town of West Champaran. An FIR was lodged in the   Town police station on October 7 the same year by Anshu’s father Ravi Ram. As police failed to be of help, he filed a criminal writ petition in the HC on July 19 last year.
 
 West Champaran SP Jayant Kant physically appeared before the division bench of Justice   and Justice   on Wednesday and assured the HC that police would leave no stone unturned to rescue the child. The court directed the SP to submit an action taken report in three weeks.
 
 Petitioner’s counsel Chandra Kant said police had arrested the child’s neighbour, Bittu Kumar, in connection with the kidnapping. “Bittu even gave a confessional statement to police that he kidnapped the child to pressurise his mother to establish physical relation with him,” the lawyer said and added Bittu had said that he had handed over the child to one Shiv Mohan.
 
 “Police did not examine the call records of suspects nor did they try to nab Shiv Mohan,” he said, adding police filed a chargesheet against Bittu. The lawyer said Bittu, on coming out of jail last year, told the mother that her son had been kept in Siliguri in West Bengal.
