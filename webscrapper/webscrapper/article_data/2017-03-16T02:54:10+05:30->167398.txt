MUMBAI:  , probing the seizure of   currency notes in new denominations found that the prime suspect, Salman Supariwala (28) had been studying noteprinting details over the internet for few weeks. His associate, Waqa Ansari (21), was arrested last week after he used a fake Rs500 note to pay a   for riding a bike without a helmet.

 Supariwala, the son of a businessman from Agripada, had printed fake Rs500 and Rs2,000   using a scanner-cum-printer at his godown near Babulnath in south Mumbai. Both accused were on Wednesday produced before court and remanded to judicial custody. “They used the fake notes to buy drugs and it was Supariwala’s idea to print them. We have seized blank papers, the scanner-cum-printer and fake notes. We are looking for two more accused,” said an officer. All the seized notes were printed two weeks ago, police said. 
 
 Police on nakabandi on February 3 intercepted Ansari on a bike. They found 21 notes in Rs 2,000 denomination and 11 notes in Rs500 denomination with him. The notes did not contain the water mark and other security features. 
 
 “Ansari used to work in a call centre but was sacked over his drug addiction. Ansari told us that it was the first time he was going to buy drugs using fake notes. He is claiming he was unaware about the authenticity of the notes. He could be lying. We are probing how much money was pumped into the market,” added the officer. Police said Supariwala had supplied notes to other accused, who handed them over to Ansari.
