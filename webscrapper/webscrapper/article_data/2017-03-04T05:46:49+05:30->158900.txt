FEROZEPUR: Attempt of   (Grewal) leaders to meet 16 Sikhs lodged in   for their involvement in a clash with   was thwarted by  

 SSF national president Bhai Gurcharan Singh Grewal, along with national general secretary Dilbagh Singh Virk and other office-bearer, arrived at the jail on Friday to express solidarity with Sikh protesters. These activists were arrested by the Ferozepur police after they tried to disrupt the religious congregation by Dera followers at Makhu and Mallanwala on February 25. Two minors were also arrested and have been lodged in juvenile home in Ludhiana.
 
 While protesting against denial of permission by the jail authorities, Grewal and his supporters staged a dharna outside the prison gate. “Jail officials are behaving like dictators. How can they stop anyone from meeting the inmates,” he asked.
 
 Virk said it is unfortunate that Ferozepur deputy commissioner did not take their call when they tried to contact him to get his approval for allowing them to meet the jailed activists.
 
 When contacted, Jail officials said that as per the prison rules, only blood relations of prisoners could meet them, while friends were allowed to meet them when no one from their family was able to visit them.
