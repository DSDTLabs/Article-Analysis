TIRUNELVELI: More than 80 percent   State Transport Corporation (TNSTC) went off the road in   city on Friday morning leaving the public in a lurch. Private buses ran as usual, while mini buses came to the rescue of the struggling commuters. This forced people to depend more on taxi and autorickshaws.

 M Mahesh of Samathanapuram in Tirunelveli had a tough time reaching the city from Madurai. “Demands of the TNSTC drivers and conductors could be genuine. But this is not the way they should have gone on strike. They should have given time for the public to make alternate travel arrangements,” he said.
 
 Like many others, the 39-year-old who went to Madurai for passport related work realised the intensity of the strike only on Thursday night. “I waited for hours but could not get a bus to Tirunelveli. I got a train and have been getting lifts and autorickshaw rides over the last two hours to cover a 15 km stretch to reach home,” the frustrated man said.
 
 A senior TNSTC official said that the situation started improving from the afternoon and that around 50 per cent buses hit the road for the afternoon shift. School students were among the worst hit by the strike as they struggled to go reach school on time.   district was no different as more than 80 percent of the 380 buses were off the road. Trade union leaders claimed that less than 10 percent buses were operated in the city. Vadasery bus stand in Nagercoil looked deserted from the morning. Trade union leaders on strike said only 15 per cent buses were operated.
 
 A TNSTC official said that 25 percent of the buses plying from Kanyakumari and Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram were operated. On the other hand, all Kerala buses plying from Thiruvananthapuram to Kanyakumari topped services at  . Officials hoped that more buses will be operated on Saturday following intervention of the Madras High Court.
