The album starts with Sooda Oru Sooriyan, that opens with unusual percussion and leads into a peppy folk number. A simple tune, with heady beats, this track is sung by Deepak who has done justice to the peaks in the number. The tabla and tavil are the highlights of the song. Fall in love with Paarai Mele. A romantic number, the track makes one nostalgic about all the older   tracks. One couldn’t have asked for a better singer, than Yuvan, who fills the soul into the song. The interludes, with a veena bit, make this number even more intense and lovable. However, the track could have ended on a better note as it sounds a tad abrupt. Sadness is one of Yuvan’s fortes. 

 Maina Rendu, an instrument-heavy track is melancholy personified.   does his best and invokes the right feelings when you listen to this number. The powerful lyrics by   are a treat to the ears. Yuvan has tactfully balanced the vocals and the instrumentation in this one. The apt lyrics, vocals and tune don’t fail to capture the listener. Finally, there is the theme song, Sathriyan In Action. A high-voltage, grand track that slowly catches pace and turns action-packed. It is not addictive or haunting, but it sure will bring some life into the movie.
