The girl is now employed in the railway,” said Rajathiammal.
 
 After the girl’s family refused to return the money and jewellery, the mother and son filed a police complaint. But, police did not file an FIR until the   ordered them to do so.
 
 “The police has filed an FIR and the court has asked the police to submit a report. But, they are neither conducting investigations nor helping us get our property back. We do not know what to do. We have petitioned all senior officials in the state government. Whenever we go to the police commissioner’s office, they do not let us meet him,” said Sakthivel. 
 
 On Monday, they petitioned the district collector again stating they had been waiting for justice for the last 14 years. “We have done everything and we do not know what else to do. There is an FIR, there is evidence as the party had given in writing to the police that they will return our jewellery,” added Rajathiammal. TNN
