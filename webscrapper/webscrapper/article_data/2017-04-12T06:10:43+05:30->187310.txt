KOLKATA: Super   Lamborghini   that set Germany’s famed Nürburgring Nordschleife circuit on fire (by breaking the fastest lap time record previously held by Porsche 918 Spyder) made a pit stop in Kolkata on Tuesday, only the second in India after Delhi ahead of more fancied Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad to underline the city’s emergence as an important market for supercars.

 Huracán Performante was unveiled at Geneva Motor Show only last month and its commercial production at at Sant’Agata Bolognese in Italy, is still a month away.
 
 Speaking to TOI, Sharad Agarwal, Automobili Lamborghini India head, said, Eastern India with over 10 Lamborghinis, most in Kolkata, has crossed an important milestone and is now featured among the list of important markets that no carmaker could ignore. “This is the first time we are unveiling a Lamborghini in this city. We have noticed people here do not prefer entry level cars. That holds true even when it comes to supercars that are worth crores. People here have taste and passion and want the best. That is why we decided to bring this particular model to the city,” said Agarwal.
 
 Lamborghini sells Huracán and Avantador line of cars priced between Rs 3.14-5.01 crore with customers spending an additional 20-25 per cent on customisation. Huracán Performante that costs Rs 3.97 crore can do 0-100kmph in 2.9 seconds and has a top speed of 325kmph. Powering the monster is a 5.2 litres V10 engine with a power boost that belts out maximum power of 639PS and a peak torque 600Nm. Huracán’s competitors in the Indian market are Ferrari, Porsche and Aston Martin.
 
 Auto enthusiasts, from scions of business families to first generation entrepreneurs, drooled over the jaw-dropping electric lime green car sporting a raging bull on the bonnet. But it the yet-to-be launched SUV Urus that is expected to set the supercar market ablaze and even pave the way for a Lamborghini showroom in Kolkata soon.
