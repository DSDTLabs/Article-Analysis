Trichy: PMK founder S Ramadoss has sought an inquiry into alleged irregularities in the selection of registrar at the Bharathidasan University. This is following reports in a section of the media that the selection panel favoured a particular candidate during the selection process. He also demanded resignation of higher education secretary Sunil Paliwal as the appointment was made under his supervision. The Bharathidasan University had invited applications for key posts including registrar, controller of examination and director of centre for distance education last year, following which the appointments were on December 11, 2017, but allegations were raised against the registrarâ€™s appointment. Alleging that the selection panel favoured appointing Gopinath Ganapathy as the registrar at the cost of other able candidates, Ramadoss asked how he was given full marks for publishing books and papers when he had kept the column blank in his applications. While M Selvam was leading the race with 57 marks out of 75 in terms of academic performance, he was allegedly awarded only 3 marks out of 25 in the interview to bring Gopinath Ganapathy on top of other candidates. Saying that the same partiality was shown in the interview for the selection of controller of examination, Ramadoss said that K Doraiyarasan who is now the controller was trailing in term of academic performance compared to other candidates, but was brought to the fore after getting high marks in the interview.
