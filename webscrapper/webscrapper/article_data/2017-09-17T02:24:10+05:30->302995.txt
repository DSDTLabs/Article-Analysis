GREATER NOIDA: Bundles of textbooks, including those meant for free distribution to children of economically weaker sections (EWS), were set on fire at the office of assistant basic shiksha adikari ( ) in Jewar on Friday.

 Most burnt books had an RTE logo printed on them. Books under the name of “Ganit (Mathematics)” with subtitle reading “for free distribution” were half-burnt. Other books included the “Nai Kiran: Part 1 and 2”.
 
 The books are believed to have been burnt on Friday morning when the staff were cleaning the government school in the ABSA office premises. 
 
 The ABSA office is next to the office of sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Jewar. Later, visitors to the SDM office noticed smoke rising from the office premises.
 
 Though waste burning in the open is a clear violation of guidelines of the  , officials had no satisfactory reply when confronted with photographs from the spot.
 
 When contacted, SDM, Jewar, Rajpal Singh said he has sought a written reply from the office of basic shiksha adhikari on the matter. “We’ll send a report to the district magistrate who will decide whether a disciplinary or a departmental action be taken in the case,” Singh told TOI.
 
 Sunil Mudgal, ABSA, Jewar, defended the incident saying that the peons were cleaning the school and the books set on fire were second-hand books. “The cleaning staff might have burnt the old papers. The syllabus has changed and the books mentioned might be old ones, which would not have come to anyone’s use,” he said.
 
 Singh further said that the department is short of books as the new stock of books for the children studying in the new session has not come in yet. According to sources, as many as 15% of students are studying without textbooks in Jewar and the state government has provided books for only those children admitted to schools before April 30, 2017.
