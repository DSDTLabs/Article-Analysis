VELLORE: Sriharan (alias) Murugan, one of the life convicts in the   assassination case, on Monday resorted to ‘Mouna Virtham’ (observance of silence) seeking spiritual solace. 

 This was not the first time he is abstaining from talking to others.
 
 Officials of the   department said that Murugan stopped talking to fellow inmates in the   Central Prison for Men since dawn. 
 
 He communicated to the prison authorities through writing that he would observe the virtham for 48 days (oru mandalam). 
 
 Clad in Kaavi (saffron) and sporting bread, the 49 year-old inmate is often found in the prison temple. 
 
 The officials said that he embraces silence to seek inner peace. 
 
 It is the fourth time he resorted to such penance since 2015. The last time (in the month of June 2017), he abstained from talking to others for nearly 20 days besides observing fasting to attain ‘Jeeva Samathi’ to end his misery.
 
 He, however, withdrew hunger protest after repeated talk and persuasion by the senior prison officials, including then ADGP of prisons C Sylendra Babu.
 
 Interestingly, Murugan has been defending his case filed by the prison authorities after seizing two mobile phones and a SIM card from his cell on March 24 last year. 
 
 He cross-examined seven of the witnesses, including prison and police department officials, till date. The next hearing is scheduled on Tuesday. 
 
 “We don’t know how will he continue his argument in the case and cross-examine the witnesses, if he sticks to the virtham,” said an official.
 
 Whenever he observes ‘mouna virtham’, he writes in a piece of paper and passes it others to communicate, added the official.
 
 Mruguan’s wife Nalini was incarcerated in the special prison for women in the same case. They meet every fortnightly (on Saturdays) in the special prison for 30 minutes.
