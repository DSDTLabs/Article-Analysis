Nagpur: Principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) AK Misra has reconstituted the Special Investigating Team ( ) in the   tiger   case.

 The team will be headed by Pench field director Rishikesh Ranjan while wildlife divisional forest officer (DFO) SB Bhalavi, Pench assistant conservator of forest (ACF) Shatanik Bhagwat, and Ramtek ACF Vishal Borade and one police department representative will be part of the SIT.
 
 The team will coordinate with assistant conservator of forests (ACF) Geeta Nannaware and will lend all support needed for further investigations.
 
 However, it seems, the two range forest officers (RFOs) Pandurang Pakhale and Nilesh Gawande, who cracked the case and arrested 16 accused, will now not be part of the investigating team.
 
 As per the directions from principal secretary (forest) Vikas Kharge, head of forest force Shree Bhagwan had on September 18 suggested names of DFO GK Vashishtha, retired DFO Kishor Mishrikotkar, Satpuda Foundation chief Kishor Rithe and wildlife lawyer Kartik Shukul as members of the SIT.
 
 However, Misra, after discussions with other officials, restructured the SIT. He had earlier told TOI that he would reconsider the role of NGOs and retired officials in the SIT. In the meanwhile, a draft proposing CBI probe in the matter has also been forwarded to the state government.
 
 As per the charge sheet filed in the Ramtek court, at least five tigers have been killed and their body parts removed by 16 accused, who are fishermen involved in illegal fishing in Totladoh reservoir inside Pench Tiger Reserve.
 
 The SIT has been constituted for an impartial probe in the matter, especially after a controversy erupted over death of one of the accused Mahadeo Uikey, who fled from forest custody on August 18 and was found dead on August 26 near his village Dhawlapur.
