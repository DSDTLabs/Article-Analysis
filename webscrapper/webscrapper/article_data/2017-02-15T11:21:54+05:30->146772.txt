Bubbly beauty Raashi Khanna has many reasons to rejoice. The actress is going around the world quite often, living it up and also is able to take up craziest projects in Tollywood. Apart from Ravi Teja's upcoming flick and a few more to release, the actress is now one of the lead heroines in Tarak's next with Bobby, 'Jai Lava Kusa'. 

 While the project is being bankrolled by NTR Arts with Nandamuri Kalyan Ram as producer, it is said that Tarak is going to experiment a bit about his triple role for the first time. The other two heroines are yet to be finalised for the movie which is going on floors very soon.
 
 Special make-up professionals were roped in from foreign countries to work out best possible looks for Tarak, which includes a hairstyle that the actor gets styled all the way from Dubai. Devi Sri Prasad is working on the film's music, which is aimed for a theatrical release in August. Keep tuned to this space for more updates about NTR 27
