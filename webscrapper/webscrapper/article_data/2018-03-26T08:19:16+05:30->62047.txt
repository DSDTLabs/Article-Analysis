HYDERABAD: In spite of tall claims made by officials about cleaning the highly-polluted  , the water body in the heart of the city continues to   - an ecological warning that the lake water has turned toxic and unfit for aquatic life. 

 Hyderabadis, who chose to spend the Sunday evening strolling at the picturesque Tank Bund, were greeted by large swathes of thick foam at various points in the Hussainsagar. Earlier, the lake had frothed at its outlet channel. 
 
 Hussainsagar is perhaps the only artificial lake in the country with a very large catchment area spread over 287 sq km. Ironically, the catchment now feeds the lake with municipal sewage as well as chemical and pharmaceutical pollutants from scores of industries. The toxic water of the lake in turn empties into the   river, which has over the years turned into a factory of highly-drug resistant bacteria.
 
 The lake, which was built by the  , once provided drinking water to Hyderabad and Secunderabad. Thick foam layers emerged in the water body hardly a month after officials claimed they initiated measures to reduce pollution and stop the foul smell that has now become the trademark of Hussainsagar. Incidentally, the Save Our Urban Lakes (SOUL), an organisation fighting to protect city water bodies, had a few week ago petitioned the   to take cognisance of dangerous contaminants in the Hussainsagar.
 
 "Now that summer has set in, the pollution level will only increase," said environmental activist Vinod Yadav.
