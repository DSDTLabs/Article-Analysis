NEW DELHI: No overloaded   will be allowed on the newly opened Eastern Peripheral Expressway ( ) from June 15 when   starts on this   for the national capital. The access-controlled   also offers an opportunity for the enforcement agencies to end the menace of overloading, officials said.

 TOI has learnt that the   had recently raised concern with NHAI officials that strict enforcement of barring   vehicles after installing weigh-in-motion (WIM) bridges may lead to such vehicles passing through Delhi. “Plying of overloaded vehicles is not allowed as per the   order. Such vehicles must be stopped and allowed only after unloading the extra weight. The transporter is responsible for taking care of the unloaded weight,” said an official adding that despite the court’s direction, local transport departments and police have been allowing overloaded vehicles after collecting fine.
 
 
  
 “As per the Motor Vehicles Act, only transport department officials and not traffic police are empowered to penalise overloaded vehicles. Now with the e-way bill in place, the enforcement agencies can easily identify which vehicle is destined for Delhi and can stop the ones from entering the national capital, which are not destin ed for the city,” said S P Singh of IFTRT, a Delhi-based think-tank on transport issues.
 
 Officials admitted that strict enforcement will bring discipline and transporters will stop this practice. NHAI’s toll rules specify that vehicle overloaded by more than 10% will have to pay 10 times of the toll and that will become a major deterrent. 
 
 NHAI has created space for vehicles to unload their extra weight along the EPE at designated entry points so that they can comply with the law.
