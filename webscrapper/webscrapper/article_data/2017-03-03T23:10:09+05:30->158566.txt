Actresses of all ages go weak in the knees at the thought of sharing screen space with 
 . The   heartthrob has charmed women of all ages, and   is no exception to that. 

  
  
 The actress has harboured ambitions to work with SRK for the longest time. When she got to know that  , who directed her in ‘Raanjhanaa’ and the ‘Tanu Weds Manu’ series, was making a film with the superstar, Swara apparently approached him for a role. 
  
 According to reports, she told the director that she loved SRK and had grown up obsessing over his films. Swara made it clear that she wanted to romance the 51-year-old actor and wouldn’t play his sister or daughter. To her disappointment, the only role that Aanand could offer her was that of Shah Rukh’s mother in the film. 
  
 Swara ended up turning down the offer. Guess she will have to hold out longer for a role opposite SRK.
