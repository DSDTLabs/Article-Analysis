KOLKATA: With two Bengali films, ‘Chalbaaz’ and ‘Tui Shudhu Amar’, being slated for shoot in the UK from June 3, at least 10 technicians are worried about their visas following the  . Any delay in the arrival of the visas will throw the film work off the schedule, though none of the venues is in Manchester.

 Director Joydeep Mukherjee, who is supposed to leave for the UK this Thursday for back-to-back shoot of the two films, had a déjà vu when he heard about the Manchester attack. “For a recce for the movies, we had reached London just a day after the Westminster attack. We were scared about what would happen but we could work. Now, just days before leaving for the shoot, the Manchester attack took place. I don’t know what the circumstances will be in the UK,” Mukherjee said. “I wonder what will happen to the technicians’ visas that haven’t reached us yet. We work on a tight schedule with limited budget. If the visas don’t come by, things may go haywire.” 
 
 With UK visas, which were usually issued in two weeks, now take around six weeks, the film team fears the blast might delay the process further. “Among the actors, visas of Soham, Om, Mahi and Biswanath Basu have reached us. But actor Parthsarathi Joardar’s visa has been pending,” said producer Himanshu Dhanuka. For ‘Chalbaaz’, actors Subhasree and Shakib Khan from Bangladesh have recently applied for their visas. “As their   is slated for June, they have time in hand. They are to leave on June 19. But I’m still worried,” Dhanuka added.
 
 Mukherjee’s assistant director Rajdeep Ghosh hasn’t got his visa yet. This is his first trip to the UK. “I am supposed to leave on May 25, but I am still awaiting my visa. A second team will leave for June 2, I hope I can make it to the UK with them,” Ghosh said. Om, who will leave on June 2, said, “We will avoid locations close to Manchester, but at the end of the day, we have to work. The show must go on.”
