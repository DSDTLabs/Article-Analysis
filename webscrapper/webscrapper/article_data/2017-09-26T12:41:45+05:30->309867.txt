PUNE: Students from College of Engineering, Pune (CoEP),   and also a few students from New Delhi will be involved in preparing a development plan (DP) for Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad under the   ( ) project.

 CoEP students have collaborated with the Norway-based university and have started visiting villages around Pune. They will make recommendations in the project report to be submitted by November.
 
 “Masters students prepare a plan based on inputs received from field visits to these villages. It is purely an academic exercise but very useful to PMRDA in their projects,“ P M  , a faculty member at CoEP planning department, said.
 
 The exercise is being conducted by 25 students of CoEP , 18 students from the Norwaybased institute and 18 students from the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi.
 
 The students are collecting information by visiting villages with a population of more than 3,000 and a development plan for 20 years will be prepared based on the information collected. Raval said, “The information would be collected under different categories such as socio-economic, utilities, industries, demographic, among other things. The information collected could be analysed and recommendations based on the analysis would also be incorporated in the report.“ The three-month exercise would be completed by November. The Norwegian students were looking to conduct a study in India and had contacted CoEP for the purpose. With this PMRDA project, it was decided to involve them and take their inputs in planning as well.
 
 “The villages are huge and in many places there are industrial areas, whereas some places are tourist hot spots. Based on these parameters, the students will prepare the plan. Their ideas could also be incorporated in the final DP ,“ PMRDA chief Kiran Gitte said.
