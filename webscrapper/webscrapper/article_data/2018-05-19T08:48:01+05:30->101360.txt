PANAJI: If all goes well, the onset of southwest   over Goa may occur by June 6 on schedule, as it is likely to hit Kerala coast, three days in advance on May 29 this season.

 Normally, June 1 is the scheduled date for the advance of the monsoon over the southern state. “The south-west monsoon is expected to set in over Kerala on May 29 with a model error of ± (plus or minus) 4 days,”   (IMD) announced on Friday.
 
 Goa receives the first monsoon rain by July 6, but meteorologists from IMD,   are non-committal about the arrival date. “If the monsoon current is strong, then it may reach on time. But if it is weak it may be delayed by some days,” an official said.
 
 In 2017, the southwest monsoon had advanced over entire Goa only two days behind schedule, but quicker than the three to four days forecast by the Panaji centre.
 
 In 2016, the monsoon had arrived 13 days late.
 
 The northern limit of monsoon (NLM) had remained stuck in Karwar for some time, as the weak current stalled its further onset over Goa.
 
 The light to moderate rainfall in Goa continued during the last 24 hours ending on Friday morning, as   recorded the highest rainfall of 102.mm, Sanguem 9.8mm, Dabolim 3.9mm, Sakhali 2.0 and Ela 02.mm.
 
 Light to moderate rain or thunder showers are very likely to occur at a few places over north Goa and south Goa districts till late Friday and at isolated places during subsequent four days.
 
 A thunderstorm associated with gusty winds speed reaching 30 knots is likely at isolated places over north Goa and south Goa districts, IMD stated.
