Ponda/Panaji:  , 54, a Dharbandora-based farmer, was found dead around 100 metres from his home late Wednesday evening.   on his chest and abdomen suggest he was attacked by a gaur (Indian bison) that villagers claimed to have sighted in the area during the afternoon.

 Ponda police confirmed that Solyenkar was found lying in a pool of blood with around seven injuries. A forensics expert, who conducted an autopsy at the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMC), pinned the cause of the farmer’s death on penetration to the abdomen and subsequent haemorrhage. 
 
 Quoting villagers, police said Solyenkar had ventured into a forested area, not very far from his house, to gather some barks for a fence around his horticultural farm. “When he got home for lunch, Solyenkar told his wife that he saw a bison nearby. The animal probably attacked him when he went back into the forest after his lunch break,” a police source said. 
 
 Most farmers in the area engage in cashew and banana cultivation and locals suspect that the bison may have strayed into a farm looking for cashew fruits to feed on. 
 
 When Solyenkar failed to return home in the evening, his family and neighbours, who began a search for him, claimed to have found him in a critical condition. They immediately informed the Usgao police outpost, which, in turn, alerted the Ponda police station. Police rushed to the site and found that the farmer was dead. 
 
 Following the postmortem examination, Solyenkar’s body was handed over to his family. The last rites were conducted on Thursday evening. A case of unnatural death has been registered under   of the criminal procedure code. Ponda PSI   is investigating the matter.
 
 While the incident has led to villagers and other farmers in the area fearing for their lives, Kuldeep Sharma, a forest official from Ponda, said the department would take necessary action to ensure their safety. “If the bison strays habitually, we might have to relocate it,” he said.
