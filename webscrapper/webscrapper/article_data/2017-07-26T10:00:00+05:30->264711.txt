Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a condition which affects the joints of the body, commonly hands and knees. It causes pain, swelling and stiffness of the joints. It is an autoimmune disease meaning that the body makes destructive chemicals against its own parts. Though the brunt is borne by the joints, many other parts including heart, lungs, eyes, kidneys and nerves are also affected.

 RA is considered as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease by many risk models. The chances of coronary blockage increase in presence of RA. RA also causes valve disease, pericarditis and electrical blockage in the heart.
 
 Nearly 7 million people in India suffer from RA. 
  
 
 A new aspect of the connection between RA and   has recently been explored.
  Researchers studied the effect of psychological symptoms like anger, anxiety, depression and caregiver stress on 195 RA patients and compared them with 1073 patients without RA. The study showed that increase in anger, anxiety, depression or caregiver stress scores led to increase in chances for atherosclerosis (or blockage) in the arteries supplying blood to the heart. This in turn can enhance risk of heart attack. 
 
 Increased job stress was also linked to the increase in heart disease indicators. However, if the RA patient had good social support (eg. from family, friends, co-workers, etc.), a reduction in this effect was observed.
 
 On the whole, this study showed that a depressed, anxious or angry RA patient maybe at greater risk of heart disease than someone who is not under psychological stress. A reduction in job stress and increased social support might also help reduce the risk of future  . 
 
 If you are a RA patient, keeping your mind stress-free might help in more ways than one!
