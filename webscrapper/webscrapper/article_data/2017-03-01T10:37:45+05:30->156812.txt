CHENNAI: Medium-pacer   (5/25) ran through the Mumbai batting line-up to help   notch up a 80-run victory in the third round match of the   here at the MRF Pachyappas Ground on Tuesday .

 Batting first, MP set a modest 215-run target for Mumbai on a true batting pitch. But quite inexplicably,  's men suffered a collapse to get bundled out for a paltry 134 in just 38.4 overs. Off-spinner   (3/30) too came good for MP . With Tuesday's win MP have 8 points from three games while Mumbai too have the same points with two wins and a loss.
 
 Mumbai bowlers   (3/27) and   (2/40) did a good job to restrict MP to 214 but their star-studded batting line-up disappointed. It was important for Mumbai to have a good start and both the openers Prithvi Shaw (18) and Akhil Herwadkar (13) looked good but the former played a hasty shot to offer a simple catch to Ankit Sharma at cover off Sakure. All Mumbai needed was a solid partnership in the middle but the likes of Shreyas Iyer (8), Abhishek Nayar (24), skipper Tare (4), Siddhesh Lad (12) and Surya Kumar Yadav (0) failed to contribute when it mattered.
 
 Herwadkar followed his fellow partner soon, while trying to play through cover, only to edge the ball and offer a sitter to wicketkeeper Naman Ojha. Though veteran customer Nayar tried his best to build a partnership, he didn't get any support from his fellow batsmen. Sakure, who took three wickets against Rajasthan and two against Andhra, maintained his good form and got early breakthroughs to gain upper hand. The lanky pacer maintained a tight line, extracted good bounce and never let any Mumbai batsman to settle down. MP batsmen Ankit Dane (46) and Sohraab Dhaliwal (51) contributed well with the bat.
