LUDHIANA: The change in weather is leading to a spurt in viral   cases.

 “Hot days and nippy nights give the virus a perfect condition to attack. Besides, the immunity is low in this season which is why viral fever is common. Its symptoms include low and high grade fever, body pains, throat inflammation, runny nose, headache, nasal congestion, muscle and joint pains,” says Dr  , associate professor in medicine department at a private  .
 
 “On an average, we receive two to four cases of viral fever. But nowadays, we are getting around 10 to 12 patients regularly,” he adds.
 
 Doctors say senior citizens and children are more susceptible to the infection.
 
 Dr Gurpreet Singh, senior consultant of medicine at a private hospital near Sherpur Chowk, says, “Though viral fever afflicts all age groups, the incidence is slightly more among elderly and children as their immunity is low. We are receiving about eight cases every day.”
 
 Dr Naveen Bajaj, a neonatologist at a private hospital in Model Town, says, “There is a three-time increase in the number of viral fever cases. Among children, it is more prevalent up to the age of five, when the body’s resistance is less.”
 
 Hospitals are also receiving a number of cases of respiratory diseases.
 
 “With harvesting season round the corner, there is an increase in the number of allergic bronchitis cases,” adds Dr Naveen Bajaj.
 
 “After a fortnight, the harvesting season will peak, so will the incidence of allergic respiratory ailments, like bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,” says Dr Gurpreet Singh.
