BATHINDA: The   government apparently no record of the activists of   movement who contributed to the freedom struggle of India. The freedom fighters wing of the department of general administration has lost the record pertaining to the   movement. 

 The fact came to light after a Barnala-based RTI activist   sought details of freedom fighters from the Praja Mandal movement. Then Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had on November 4, 1997 honoured the activists of Praja Mandal for contributing to the freedom struggle.
 
 After Narinder pursued the matter with the officials, the freedom fighters cell got a daily diary report (DDR) about the missing record at the Sector 3 police station of Chandigarh on April 13. Before getting the DDR, the department sought details from each of its section about the file pertaining to 'Grant of financial assistance from the Punjab government to the freedom fighters and their families.'
 
 The record could not be traced anywhere in the department. Earlier, the department had declined to provide the record, claiming it was older than 20 years and was not available with it. 
 
 When contacted, the freedom fighter cell superintendent Kanwaljit Kaur said, "We have searched the record in every section, it is not traceable. We have lodged a complaint with the Chandigarh police and a DDR has been registered in the matter."
