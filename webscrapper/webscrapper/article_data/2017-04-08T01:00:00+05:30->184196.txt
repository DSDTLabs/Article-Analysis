 A source from the team tells us, "We have already shot 30-40% of the film. There are around five-six locations in Haryana where the film will be shot. Before Gurgaon, we also shot in Sonipat." The Gurgaon shoot was near Sector 37 at a car showroom and the day-long shoot was mostly indoors. The first shooting schedule of the movie was completed in Manali in February. Incidentally, the film has almost the same title as Kareena Kapoor Khan and Sonam Kapoor-starrer 'Veerey Di Wedding', which is yet to start shooting.
