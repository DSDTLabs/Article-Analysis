MUMBAI: The   corruption bureau on Tuesday recorded the statement of   politician and former revenue minister Eknath   in connection with a complaint of   against him.

 Khadse confirmed that he was in the Nashik   office to record his statement. 
 
 “I have already given all the documents pertaining to my assets and liabilities to the ACB. On Tuesday, my statement was recorded,” Khadse said.
 
 Khadse has all along said that not one corruption charge against him could be proved. “Several allegations were made against me, I was accused of indulging in corrupt practices, but all the agencies have given me a clean chit,” Khadse said.
 
 Following a complaint lodged by social worker  , the ACB had initiated an inquiry against Khadse to check if he had disproportionate assets.
 
 “My contention is that all agencies probed the charges against me but found no substance in the charges,” Khadse said.
 
 Khadse was also locked in a controversy after his wife and son-in-law purchased “MIDC land” in Pune. The Zoting committee report on it was never tabled in the legislature on the grounds that it had no relevance as the Bombay high court was now seized of the matter..
