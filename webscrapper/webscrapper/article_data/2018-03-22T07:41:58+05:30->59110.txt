AHMEDABAD: To send out the message that cops, especially women cops, should never be messed with, DySP Manjeeta Vanzara took out a   who had assaulted her while she was probing a   in Kadi town of Mehsana. The men’s hands were tied as they marched.

 According to police sources, Kadi police had arrested Shaikh Imamuddin, Maqbul Vepari, and Hanit Qadar in a case of dacoity which had occurred on March 13.
 
 “When the accused were taken for further investigation to the scene of crime, some local residents pelted stones at the cops,” a police source said. “However the cops fought back and did not let the accused escape. In the assault, Manjeeta’s right hand was fractured.”
 
 On Wednesday, Kadi police arrested two men allegedly involved in the assault. Manjeeta, with her right hand in a sling, publicly shamed the accused by parading them on the streets.
