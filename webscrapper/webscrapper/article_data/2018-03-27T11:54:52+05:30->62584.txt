NAGPUR: The state information commissioner (SIC), Nagpur, Dilip Dharurkar, has issued show-cause notice and also imposed penalty of Rs 2,000 to chief general manager (CGM) of   (FDCM) for violating   Act provisions by causing delay in providing information by deliberately transferring application to irrelevant authorities.

 This is for the second time FDCM has been imposed the cost in the same matter. RTI activist Avinash   had sought information about financial irregularities detected during internal audit between 2001 and 2015. Instead of making full disclosure, officials provided partial information to Prabhune. Hence, SIC had imposed the cost.
 
 After the cost was imposed, Prabhune was supplied information on five queries, but here too, the public information officer (PIO) and chief general manager (CGM) at FDCM deliberately delayed giving information by transferring it to accounts section.
 
 Hence, during the hearing before SIC, the commissioner imposed a cost of Rs 2,000 by not supplying information on merit causing mental and physical harassment to the applicant.
 
 TOI in October 2015 and December 2016 had reported how FDCM buried the internal audit report and failed to act against officials indicted for financial irregularities.
 
 The RTI information pertains to financial irregularities to the tune of Rs 4 crore detected in audit. A four-member committee was formed under IFS officer   in 2011. After investigating the matter, the committee submitted a report to the FDCM managing director on August 30-31, 2012. It suggested action against erring officials and also recommended to lodge FIR and complaints with the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB). However, no action on it is taken yet.
 
 Prabhune has filed a complaint with AG office at Nagpur and Mumbai but there is no reply. “I’m planning to file a writ before the high court for issuing directions,” said Prabhune.
