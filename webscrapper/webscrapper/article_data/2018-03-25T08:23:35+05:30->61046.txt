PATNA: The four-day Chaiti   came to an end on Saturday morning with devotees offering ‘arghya’ to the rising sun amid tight security at different places in the city. Married men and women observing the 36-hour long and rigorous fast stood in knee-deep water and prayed for the well-being and prosperity of their families.

 Thousands of devotees were seen walking towards different ghats like Collectorate Ghat, Digha 98, Mahendru   and  , among others. The administration had deployed police personnel and installed   cameras at 19 ghats.
 
 A carnival-like atmosphere prevailed as women sang Chhath songs while offering the last ‘arghya’. All the roads leading to the ghtas were decked up with fancy lights and makeshift pandals, floodlights and barricades were also put up.
 
 The district administration heaved a sigh of relief as the four-day long puja, which began on March 21, ended peacefully on Saturday. District magistrate  , who inspected the Collectorate Ghat on Saturday morning, expressed satisfaction over the successful completion of the puja and said a large number of devotees offered ‘arghya’ on the last day.
 
 The puja started on Wednesday with the ritual of ‘nahay-khay’, in which devotees prepared the traditional ‘lauki-bhaat’ after bathing. This was followed by ‘kharna’ on Day 2 when devotees prepared ‘kheer’ mixed with jaggery. On the third day, they stood in water at the ghats and offered the first ‘arghya’ to the setting sun. On the final day of the puja, devotees and their friends and relatives assembled at the river bank before sunrise and offer ‘arghya’ to the rising sun.
 
 Sunita Prakash, a devotee at Collectorate Ghat, said, “As per tradition,   is performed to thank Sun god who sustains life on earth. All rituals and songs sung by the devotees during the festival centre around worshipping the sun with the belief that it helps in promoting health and prosperity.”
