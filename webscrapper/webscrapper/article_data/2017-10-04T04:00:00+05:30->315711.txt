Surat: Five armed dacoits robbed three employees of Regional Transport Office (RTO) of Rs 1,14,03,479 cash at Bhilad-Naroli bridge on National Highway No.8 near Bhilad in Valsad district on Tuesday. The employees of RTO Bhilad were on their way to deposit the cash at State Bank of India’s branch at Bhilad town when the robbers carried out one of the biggest highway robberies on NH-8, about 130km from Surat, on the state’s border with Maharashtra. Police later found two suspicious vehicles abandoned in Vapi in Valsad district and Kadodara in Surat district.

 A green colour vehicle came and interrupted RTO vehicle driven by Akshay Patel at 10.40am. Cashier Alpesh Patel and peon Babu Patel were also in the vehicle, which was on the bridge at that time. A person got out of the green coloured car and broke the window glass of the RTO vehicle and pointed a gun at the cashier. The bag containing the money was taken away at gunpoint by the robbers, who then sped away in their vehicle towards Vapi. 
 
 Police found a green coloured vehicle, which was probably used to carry out the robbery, abandoned on the service road in Vapi town. They also found another vehicle abandoned at Kadodara on NH-8 in Surat district. These vehicles are believed to have been used by the robbers to flee to different directions. 
 
 Valsad district police have tightened security on the border. Valsad district superintendent of police Sunil Joshi said, “We are investigating all angles, including insider role in the robbery. The reason for suspicion is huge amount of cash was being taken with no guards accompanying the party. We hope to nab the accused soon.”
