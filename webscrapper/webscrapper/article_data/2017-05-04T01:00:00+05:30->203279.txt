Looks like the team of Gautham Vasudev Menon’s   is very good at keeping secrets. While they managed to keep the identity of the film’s composer, who they still refer to as Mr X, under wraps for a long time, here’s another information which they have kept close to their chest. 

 It is well-known that   is playing the role of Dhanush’s romantic interest in the film, but another well-known Kollywood actress is also part of the cast. We learn that Neerparavai girl   has also been roped in for this action romance. The actress, we hear, shot her scenes for a few days during the early schedules of the film in Mumbai. 
 
 Interestingly, Sunainaa was also seen in a blink-and-miss role in Vijay’s Theri. However, then, she had shot only for a day for that film as a friendly gesture. But, we are told that this role in ENPT will be more of an extended cameo. 
 
 Meanwhile, the actress is all set for the release of her Telugu film, Pelliki Mundu Prema Katha, in which she is playing the female lead for the first time. The makers are also planning to release the film in Tamil as well.
