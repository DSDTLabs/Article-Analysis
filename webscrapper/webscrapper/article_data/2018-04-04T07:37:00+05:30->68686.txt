CHANDIGARH: The   government had last week made provision for social security surcharge, but most of the 731 crore collected by the state through   on liquor was utilised only to fund operational costs of schools. The Aam Aadmi Party ( ) has claimed that it underlined the need for increased budgetary allocation for the education sector while demanding an inquiry into Rs 491 crore claimed to have been released to various institutions.

 Party’s Dirba MLA Harpal Singh Cheema, who procured cess details, said Rs 384 crore was spent on operational and capital expenses of Adarsh and meritorious schools. “Besides, the government has claimed that a large chunk (Rs 492 crore) was released to different institutions, but no details have been provided. I suspect that this fund may have been misused and have sought a detailed break up from the education department,” he added.
 
  
 Another AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan from Kotkapura said, “Ideally the collection made from the cess should have been utilised for taking new initiatives and improving the state of government schools in Punjab. It shows that the state has to impose cess to even afford the running cost of schools.”
 
 Cheema added that the state government should take a cue from the Delhi government and make sizeable budgetary allocation from the education sector by making it a priority area.
 
 The education cess was collected by the state government from March 2007 to January 1, 2018. It has now been discontinued. In 2016-17, Rs 1,012 crore was collected by the excise department.
 
 “As per the excise policy 2017-18, the cess has been abolished. It was imposed to improve the quality of education and providing infrastructural and other amenities,” said an official.
 
 The funds were also used to give grants to various schools and colleges for improvement of infrastructural facilities and quality of education. However, the AAP is not satisfied and has sought details of expenses made under this head.
