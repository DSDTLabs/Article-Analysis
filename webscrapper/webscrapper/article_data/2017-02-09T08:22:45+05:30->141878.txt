PATNA: A major train accident was averted on Wednesday as villagers detected   and   of the   near Mansi just before New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express (12236) was to cross Mansi around 6.35am on the Barauni-Katihar section in Sonepur division of East Central Railway (ECR). Railway officials swung into action and repaired the track after villagers of Mansi informed the Mansi station master about the missing fishplates at 6.05am. Mansi is approximately 9km from Khagaria railway station.

 According to Katihar GRP, New Delhi-Dibrugarh Rajdhani Express was detained at Khagaria station for about three hours. Katihar-Patna Intercity Express was also detained at Khagaria.
 
 Police were investigating the matter and suspected it to be a handiwork of antisocial elements. Police are also probing the incident from various angles as two recent major train derailments in north India recently were allegedly the handiwork of terrorists. The Wednesday incident might have been a sabotage bid close on the heels of a crude bomb explosion on the railway tracks near Buxar on Monday last, police sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, ECR CPRO Arvind Rajak said railways has already put on high alert all the RPF posts in the five ECR divisions. RPF men have been asked to remain vigilant during night patrolling of the tracks, he said.
