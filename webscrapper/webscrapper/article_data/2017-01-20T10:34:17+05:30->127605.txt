JAIPUR:   had hoped to speak on his book, ‘Inner Engineering: Complete Programme for Inner Well Being’, at a press conference held at   on Thursday.

 Instead, he ended up giving his views on the controversial ‘jallikattu’, the recently banned traditional ritual sport of taming bulls, which has brought large crowds out on the streets of Tamil Nadu in protest.
 
 In the rural context, where there are no large stadiums for games such as football or cricket,  , which is held once a year in January, is a ritual sport for the youth to emerge as men after some adventure, he explained.
 
 “Young men hold on to the hump of bulls and are dragged a distance by the animal. The sport requires skill and physical fitness, and young people practice the sport months ahead of the actual event. People are now saying that this is being cruel to youth. But you cannot become a man without some adventure,” Sadhguru explained.
 
 Asked if he supported the sport, he said that he did not want to divide people on the basis of their position with regard to this sport. Apart from being a rural sport, it was also a means of keeping bulls in physical shape, he said.
 
 “These sporting bulls are best for breeding,” he explained. There were over 120 different species of native bulls, but that diversity has dwindled and now there are just about 37, he said.
 
 The bulls also provide the best manure to fertilize fields, he said, adding that cruelty to animals can be prevented by banning slaughter.
 
 “You ban the sport and these fine, young bulls will line up at the slaughter house,” he said.
 
 But organizers called for an abrupt end to the press conference, and Sadhguru quipped, referring to his book: “No inner engineering, just bulls!”
