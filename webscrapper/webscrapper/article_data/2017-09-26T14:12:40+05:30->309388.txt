AGRA: The callous approach of contractors towards road construction or repair will no longer be tolerated by the   (ADA), which will not be monitoring the status of work done through a mobile app. Contractors will now need to send a selfie with their work done, on a daily basis, to   officials till such time as the app is functional.
 
  The work of these contractors has come under severe criticism for some time. “To reduce such complaints, ADA officials have instructed contractors to send regular selfies showing the work done,” said a source.
  
  ADA has formed four different committees to conduct physical inspection on the basis of reports sent by contractors. If any kind of discrepancy is found between the report and the physical status of the work, ADA will take action against the erring contractor, officials said.
  
  “Contractors will send their selfies to executive engineers of the department and then it will be sent to higher authorities. A work with a budget of more than Rs 1 crore will be inspected by a committee comprising the ADA vice-president and secretary, while a contract with a budget between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore will be inspected by the officer on special duty. A contract of Rs 25 to Rs 50 lakh will be taken care of by the superintendent engineer. Works below Rs 25 lakh each will be checked by a team of junior engineers,” the source added.
  
  Talking to TOI, ADA secretary   said, “This new policy will help to bring about transparency between the department and contractors. With this, we can get quality works completed within stipulated deadlines.”
