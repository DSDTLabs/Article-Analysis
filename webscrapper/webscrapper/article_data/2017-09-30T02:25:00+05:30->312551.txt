Nagpur: A lower court on Friday sent one of the suspects in Sujal Wasnik kidnapping case, Sunil Meshram, to jail after taking him into magisterial custody for 15 days. Police had arrested Meshram on September 25 and wanted to stretch his remand custody for three more days. Sujal was kidnapped on September 16 but police could not trace him till date.

 With Meshram in jail, the only ray of hope for city police to crack the case is now Ramdas Madavi who is recuperating at ICU in Mayo hospital after he inflicted an injury on his neck in the lock-up. 
 
 It was reliably learnt that Madavi, who is still unfit to speak, is furnishing replies through written format. Though cops are not keen to pressurize him now, they are set to take emotional measures to make him reveal the truth. 
 
 It was learnt that Meshram’s mobile phone details too are not providing much clues to the cops except for the fact that he had switched off his cell phone a day earlier to that of Sujal’s kidnapping and started using a different number from the following day. 
 
 After handed over to cops by the villagers on September 25, Madavi had named Meshram and one Borkar as the persons who had goaded him to ask for money from the Wasnik family as they had just got substantial price for selling an ancestral property. Meshram, a driver, had walked into the police station on September 25 after learning that cops were searching for him. He was placed under arrest. Police have searched Meshram’s farmland too which is spread across four acres to ascertain whether he had concealed anything there. Police had also learnt that Meshram seldom spoke to his neighbours. Borkar, president of the village tanta-mukhti committee, too was quizzed at length by the cops.
