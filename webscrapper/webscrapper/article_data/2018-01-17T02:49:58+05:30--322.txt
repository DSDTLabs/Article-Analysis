 As per the mandate, the panel will also receive inputs on inaccuracies in availability of seats for admission by the school, which may not have been put out publicly earlier by them.
 
 “The inputs of any increase in the already less declared seats of the schools will be verified within a month and status of all such undisclosed seats will be included in the second draw of lots,” read the circular. 
 
 “Further, after scrutiny, if it is felt that due applications against the available seats are not available on the admission window, fresh application will be invited for consideration in the second draw of lots to ensure filling up of all fresh vacancies,” the circular added.
 
 Admissions to the 25% seats in private schools begin on January 22. The first draw of lots will be held on March 7.
