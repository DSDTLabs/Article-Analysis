  After Sukumar’s Ram Charan, Samantha and Aadhi Pinisetty starrer ‘Rangasthalam’, which also featured music by  , Koratala Siva’s political drama is becoming the second Telugu film, other than the ‘Baahubali’ series, to dominate the global market. 
 
 
 
  ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ charts the journey of a London-bred Bharat, who’s forced to take up the CM of an undivided Andhra Pradesh’s chair after the death of his father. While stumbling and hesitant at first, he soon grasps the need of the hour and begins to govern accordingly. However, by being honest and just, while winning the love of the people, he also manages to invite the wrath of political bigwigs, even from members of his own party. How he manages to stay afloat amidst such corruption forms the crux of the story. 
 
  In the film, Kiara Advani played the role of his love interest Vasumati, while Prakash Raj played the role of a party member who’s his father’s best friend. The film which marks the debut of Kiara Advani was appreciated for Prakash Raj and his acting chops, apart from the idealistic story and direction.
