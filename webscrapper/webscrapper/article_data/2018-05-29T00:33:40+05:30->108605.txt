NEW DELHI: Three members of an interstate gang of car lifters, who used to target only luxury vehicles across  , were arrested on Sunday. The gang employed high-end devices to nullify the carâ€™s engine control module (ECM) and would sell them to dealers in other states and Nepal as well.

 DCP (east)   said that Isteyak (40), Mohd Israr (57) and Furkhan (40) came under the scanner after stealing four cars in two days from   in east Delhi. Officers said that the route taken by the criminals while escaping with the cars was noted from the CCTV footage of the area. Subsequently, a team led by SHO Preet Vihar Maninder Singh was deployed at Karkari Mor flyover on May 19.
 
 Police stopped a   and arrested Isteyak who tried to break through the barricades but was caught. He told officers that he had stolen the SUV recently and was on his way to   to deliver it. Police later found that Isteyak had more than three dozen cases of auto-lifting against him and was even been booked under MCOCA.
 
 It was found that the gang was operating from Meerut, where the receivers buy the vehicles and re-sell them to nearby states and Nepal as well. A team was sent to Meerut from where Mohd Israr and Furkhan were arrested. Police said that four SUVs were recovered from the gang. 
 
 Police officers suspect that there are more people involved in the module. They are said to be operating from Meerut, Bulandshahar and Moradabad.
