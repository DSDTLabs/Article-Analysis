Vadodara: The office of Vadodara district education officer (DEO) has identified 24 private schools in the city which will be counselled by the DEO to voluntarily reduce their annual fees and bring it below Rs 15,000 in primary section. 

 The move comes after DEO of Ahmedabad initiated such discussions with school authorities there and convinced around 19 primary schools to reduce their fees in the range of Rs 300 to Rs 5,000 per annum. 
 
 The schools identified by Vadodara DEO presently charge annual fees in the range of Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000. 
 
 “We will be appealing the management of these schools to co-operate with the state government’s move and voluntarily reduce their fees instead of going through the lengthy process of appearing before the fee regulation committee. If they agree they will have to marginally reduce their fees and just submit an affidavit making the declaration,” said DEO M L Ratnu. 
 
 Meanwhile, nine schools including five from Mahisagar and four from Vadodara district have submitted affidavits declaring that the fees that they charge are below the prescribed upper limits fixed by the Gujarat government under the Gujarat Self-Financed School (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017.
