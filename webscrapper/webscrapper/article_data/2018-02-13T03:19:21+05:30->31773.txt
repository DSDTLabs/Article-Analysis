GURUGRAM: Rain gave Gurugram and Delhi a miss in spite of an official forecast predicting moderate showers in Delhi-NCR on Monday. Strong winds swept the city, kicking up dust but keeping the   pleasant. A light drizzle was reported in   and Ghaziabad, officials at the Regional Forecasting Weather Centre (RFWC) told TOI.

 Officials said south-easterly winds had arrived in Gurgaon and ruled out the likelihood of rainfall in the city for the next 24 hours. The temperature will remain on the lower side for two to three days before going up, they said. On Saturday, the Indian Meteorological Department had issued a statement about a bout of fresh rainfall across northwest India. “We had said rainfall would be sporadic. It is not that NCR did not receive rainfall, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad did. We had showers in Karnal as well as in parts of west UP,” a Met official said.
 
 Officials also said that the   wull clear up by Tuesday. While the mercury is expected to rise during the day later this week, it is likely to dip at nighttime.
