 “Our NGO works for educating children and we have been doing a lot of work for the deprived class. We came in contact with Markey and Swatez and invited them to do a workshop in city with students of municipal schools. They agreed and the students are having a wonderful time,” said Sagar Papneja of Pathshala.
 
 Both Markey and Swatez see their efforts to work with children living in difficult situation as healing art while bringing them out of stress and pain. “I worked in different countries and areas in past 13 years. I like working with children in conflict zones to bring them out of trauma. I cannot change something bigger but at least I can make a child happy by helping learn the art,” said Markey, who is training students in making mosaic.
 
 Swatez who is training the students for murals, said, “Working with children of conflict zones is like art therapy. In the beginning children face difficulties in expressing but gradually the art empties the darkness. It is great to see these children focused while working on the art.”
