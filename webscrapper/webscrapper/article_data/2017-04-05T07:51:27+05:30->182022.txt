 “The date for the   to start its extended run is yet to be decided,” said DRM, NER, Lucknow, Alok Singh. 
 
 NER had sent a proposal to the Railway Board to increase the frequency of Lucknow-Anand Vihar bi-weekly AC   train to five days a week. The train, at present, is available on two days— Sunday and Friday —from Lucknow and Anand Vihar terminal, respectively.
 
 At present, Lucknow Junction has only one rake of the train because of which it goes till Anand Vihar terminal and comes back to Lucknow Junction, the same day. The proposal said that once the rake of Lucknow-Anand Vihar terminal double-decker is clubbed with that of the Delhi-Jaipur double decker train, running the train from Lucknow five days a week would be possible.
 
 The train, now, will originate at Lucknow Junction, stop at Delhi station and then move to Jaipur and vice-versa. There will be 15 stations on the route.
