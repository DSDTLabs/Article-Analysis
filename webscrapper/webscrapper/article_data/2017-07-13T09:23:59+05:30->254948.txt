Sameer Nair, who had joined  ’s   as Group CEO in July 2014 to help expand their operations into digital media, is set to step down from his position on July 15. A source from   informed Mirror that the decision to end Nair’s contract was made amicably by both parties in light of Kapoor’s efforts to curb the number of big-budget commercial films the banner will release this year.

 
  
 “Nair had been in an advisory role with the company even before he stepped in as Group CEO. Now, after the successful completion of his three-year term, he relinquishes his executive position with effect from July 15 but will remain associated with us in the advisory capacity,” a Balaji spokesperson has said.
 
 “It’s been an amazing experience working with Ekta, Shobha ji (Kapoor). The company is in great shape, the TV business is doing well and we now have in place a very measured approach to the movie business. Most recently, we had a very successful launch of our global digital business with ALTBalaji,” Nair said in a statement.
