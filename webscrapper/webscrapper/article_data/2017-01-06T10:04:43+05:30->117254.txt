NEW DELHI: Ousted from their power chairs in the wake of the   order, a small group of former   officials, led by a former board president, has been trying to hinder the staging of the two warm-up games the visiting England team is going to play against an India A team on January 10 and 12.

 According to sources, calls were made to the   (CCI), the host club, by those belonging to this group, asking it to stay away from the two matches.
 
 The group, sources claimed, is hoping to disrupt board's activities in a bid to create an impression that administrative reforms mooted by the   could lead to a systematic collapse of Indian cricket. While CCI officials, speaking to TOI, denied any pressure from anyone, sources in the club did privately mention that calls were indeed received. "We are ready to host England and there is no reason to worry. England team is scheduled to do their nets from Sunday onwards and we are completely ready for the game," a CCI representative said.
 
 A top former BCCI official, who is close to the developments, confirmed to TOI that 'disgruntled' officials were also planning to meet to decide on how to take on Lodha reforms.
 
 On the other hand, a source in the Lodha panel pointed out that the Supreme Court would get tough with those former office-bearers who won't toe its line.
