Panaji: Schools across Goa have been asked to appoint a nodal officer, who can go around the school campus at least once a week and identify potential mosquito-breeding sites. Based on instructions from health officials, the directorate of education (DoE) issued a circular to schools, asking them to see that this nodal officer from the school coordinates with health officers on how to tackle sources of breeding that are identified in the school campus.

 “The nodal person will visit various sites in the premises at least once a week to identify the breeding sites and to take necessary action accordingly, viz checking of lids of overhead tanks, water leakages leading to accumulation, checking for unwanted and discarded containers etc,” the circular states.
 
 Vector-borne diseases are illnesses caused by pathogens and parasites in human. Dengue, malaria and Japanese encephalitis, kalaazar, filaria and chikungunya are some vector-borne diseases.
 
 The DoE circular also asks schools to take up projects under NCC/NSS to educate the local population by launching social service projects like camps to raise awareness about vector-borne illnesses.
 
 Schools have also been told to reach out to their parent teacher associations about prevention and control of vector-borne infections.
 
 Prevention of vector-borne infections mainly involves drinking boiled water, removing and destroying all mosquito-breeding sources and use of chemical methods of vector control, such as indoor residual sprays, space spraying, and use of chemical larvicides and adulticides reduce disease transmission by shortening or interrupting the lifespan of vectors.
