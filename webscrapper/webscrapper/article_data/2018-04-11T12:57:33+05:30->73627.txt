SURAT: A courier delivery man was booked at   police station on Monday for carrying out cheating of Rs25 lakh. The accused was supposed to deliver parcels of diamond and jewellery in Mumbai but he disappeared with the consignment. Police booked Mukesh Saini on the complaint of his employer  , a resident of Mahidharpura. Saini runs Shree Sai Parcel Service in Mahidharpura. 

 Mukesh was supposed to deliver a total of 51 parcels of diamond and jewellery to the office of the complainant in Mumbai. He left the city on Saturday with the parcels but did not reach Mumbai office till Monday. Mukesh, whom   knew through some relatives, was hired around a month ago. 
 
 Police ruled out possibility of kidnapping of Mukesh because his employer doubted his integrity. The employer informed police that he had been behaving abnormally for the past few days. Police believe it is a cheating case since Mukesh has turned his mobile phone off. 
 
 Police are looking for Mukesh at his native place in   in Rajasthan. “Attempts are being made to locate the accused. He will be nabbed soon,” police said.
