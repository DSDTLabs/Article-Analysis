 The students visited almost 200 houses in the area to create awareness on waste segregation, said S Prahadeeswaran, professor at the college and organiser of the event. “We wanted to make the areas around our college model areas. So, we first cleaned them. Then, we took the cleaning drive to villages in  . Now, our goal is to make this street a model street,” he said.
 
 Local residents, meanwhile, felt that it’s high time that the public took up the mission to maintain the city clean. “Usually, people who come to roadside tea stalls dump paper and plastic cups in the surroundings. The students have now cleaned it up. Public also must take up the mission to keep the city clean. If that happens, our city can top Swachh Bharat rankings,” a local resident said. TNN
