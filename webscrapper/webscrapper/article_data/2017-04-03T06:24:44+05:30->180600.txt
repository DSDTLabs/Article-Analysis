JAIPUR: The ruling   which is locked in a fierce fight with Congress in Dholpur by-polls got an unlikely ally in Congress leader Vishvendra Pratap Singh. Singh objected to the Congress leaders calling BJP candidate Shobha Rani Khushwaha as ‘murderer’s wife’. She is the wife of B L Khushwaha, who was convicted in a murder case.

 The BJP which has been on the back foot for fielding Khushwaha’s wife got a shot in the arm after the mercurial   came to their aid. BJP leaders said that now Congress leaders themselves are criticizing their own charges.
 
 BJP has fielded wife of former BSP MLA BL Kuhwaha for the seat following his disqualification after he was convicted in a murder case.
 
 Following the contradictory view expressed by Congress MLA, Congress party has delisted the vehicle of Singh. Sources also said that vehicle of former Union minister Jitendra Singh has also been delisted from the election campaign. The Congress party said delisting of vehicle is done to reduce the expenditure of the party candidate.
 
 Singh, Congress MLA from Deeg-Kumher, is reportedly disturbed over no one from coming to receive him when he reached Dholpur to campaign for the Congress candidate. He said Congress branding ruling party candidate as murderer’s wife is unacceptable. He said if someone committed a crime, the family members should not be blamed for the crime.
 
 Singh pointed out the example of Lalu Yadav. He said while Lalu was in jail in fodder scam, but his wife Rabri Devi became the chief minister..
