New Delhi: Two men have been   at   Airport for allegedly duping people of cash on the pretext of providing them a job there. They used to conduct fake interviews and convince the aspirants that they had been selected before taking the cash.

 The men have been identified as Kamal Arora (28) and Anshul Mishra (28). While Arora earlier worked at an IGI parking lot as a supervisor, Mishra was working for a consultancy firm in Hari Nagar dealing with companies at the airport. 
 
 Delhi Police said the accused decided to make extra money by conducting “fake” interviews during which Arora would pretend to be a general manager. “Mishra would tell the victims that he had also got a job this way while Arora would pose as a general manager and conduct the interview,” said Sanjay Bhatia, DCP (IGI Airport).
 
 S Suneel, one of the victims, complained to the police that he had been duped of Rs 80,000 by the two men. Suneel, who came from Andhra Pradesh, was made to stay in Gurgaon after which a “fake” interview was conducted. 
 
 He was asked to pay Rs 1.5 lakh for a job in Air India. “Suneel realised about the fraud when the accused stopped taking his call after getting the first instalment of Rs 80,000,” said a police official.
 
 Crime and Intelligence Wing (CIW) of CISF at the airport had already narrowed down on the suspects through CCTV surveillance after several such interviews were conducted, some even at IGI. The men were arrested by CIW and handed over to Delhi Police. 
 
 The police are trying to find out how many people had been duped by them.
