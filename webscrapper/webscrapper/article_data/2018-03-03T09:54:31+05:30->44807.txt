TRICHY: Progressive farmers who are already running Farmers’ Producers’ Companies say that an action plan should be formulated to conserve water and the stakeholders educated on its judicial use. As water scarcity has a huge impact on food production, rain-fed agriculture is the most common method in various parts of the district. 

 Some techniques in water management for rain-fed agriculture include the use of supplemental irrigation and water harvesting techniques such as rain catchment systems and weirs or sand dams. These help provide the much-needed water to areas where rainfall is inconsistent. This water helps increase the output and quality of the crops grown, said S  , managing director of the Farmers Producers Company, Thinnakkonam.
 
 “Farmers should not let even a drop of water out of their land for which they should come forward to establish water sources. Water collected from their land should be stored on their land itself so that it helps raise the groundwater level. The government should help them in this regard”, he added.
 
 Using different methods of water management was essential for agriculture as the increasing population called for an increase in food production, says  , the director of a Farmers Producer Company functioning at Nachalur.
 
 “Before seeking anything from the government, farmers should understand how precious water is. They have the responsibility to conserve it and adopt judicious method of usage. The government should create awareness in this regard and impart training for that”, he added.
