Adarsh H Eshwarappa credits   Andrew Aiello with the   style of filmmaking, because the two friends came up with ideas of shooting the 4.16 minute-long scene and using different colour tones together. And for Andrew, working on   has been a life altering experience of sorts. 

 “I first met Addy (Adarsh) when he was studying in LA. When he sent me the script of Shuddhi, I wanted to be a part of it right away as I have always been drawn to stories with a socially-conscious message,” says Andrew, adding, “I didn’t know the facts (on sexual assault in India) until Addy sent me the script. I did some research and couldn’t believe what I found. In the West, we tend to live on an island and forget that there are many issues in other countries that we don’t really deal with. I had to take that head-on with Shuddhi.”
