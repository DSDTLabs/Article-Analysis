Actress   has said people often confuse her daughter,   with her.
 
  The 40-year-old actress, who arrived with Ava on the premiere of "Big Little Lies" says the mother-daughter duo have often been mistaken for each other, reported E! News.
  
  
  
 
  
 
  
  
  "People come up to her (all the time). We were at a premiere and they were congratulating her on her performance. She's like, 'I'm not in the movie'," Witherspoon said.
  
  After the show, the 17-year-old shared a picture with her mother, where she congratulated the team for the HBO TV series.
  
  She wrote, "So proud of my awesome mama and her passion for this project. It is so nice to see these wonderful, talented women in roles just as dynamic as they are. #biglittlelies"
