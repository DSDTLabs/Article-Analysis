NEW DELHI: A day after he 
  ahead of the Punjab Assembly elections, former BJP man   said he's a "born Congressman" and his entry into the Congress is akin to a "ghar wapasi."

 "I'm a born Congressman; from birth, I'm essentially a Congressman. I've come back to my roots," Sidhu said today at a press conference, adding that his father worked with the Congress for 40 years.
 
 He added that 
  and that the issue of drugs will be top on his electoral agenda. 
 
 "Drugs are a reality in Punjab, the lives of youth are being destroyed," Sidhu said. 
 
 Sidhu, who was earlier with the BJP, demurred when asked about Prime Minister  , but he did say that unlike for most, Punjab was on the top of his agenda.
 
 "I was not ready to leave Amritsar to fight from safe seats in 2014 though I was offered it," the former cricketer said.
 
 Separately, other opposition leaders criticized Sidhu.
 
 "It's difficult to take anything that Navjot Sidhu says seriously," said   of the Shiromani Akali Dal, ANI reported. "Will people forget what he said about Sonia and Rahul Gandhi? He used the most derogatory words for Dr   sahib," Majithia added.
 
  called Sidhu someone who changes parties per his convenience. "He changes parties and makes deals, people don't know this about him," Badal said, according to ANI.
