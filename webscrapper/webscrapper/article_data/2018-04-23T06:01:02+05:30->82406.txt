KOLKATA: The euphoria over demolition of   buildings, clearing the way for construction of New Garia-Airport viaduct, died down on Sunday with the construction agency,  , claiming compensation worth Rs 174 crore for the time overrun of nearly three years due to the realignment proposed by the state.

 Though the claim will be settled though a tribunal, the compensation-claim itself is an indication of the cost-overrun of the project that faced hurdles at several places where the   government had to intervene to clear the way for the viaduct. But major delay happened due to uncertainty over the demolition of the buildings and shops, said a   ( ) official.
 
 Earlier, Afcons had told RVNL, the executing agency of the project, that it will withdraw from the stretch in Mahishbathan because of the inordinate delay. In June 2011, Metro alignment was notified under Section 21 of Metro Railways Construction and Works Act prohibiting any construction along the alignment. At that time, none of the four multi-storeyed buildings and shops were there. They all came up after 2014.
 
 During the final survey of the alignment, RVNL found that a few buildings had come up right on the line of the Metro viaduct. The buildings were “illegal” as they were developed after the Metro notification. But the Bengal government, in a bid to avoid displacement of so many people, tried its best to bypass the buildings, said a state official.
 
 Eventually, the state approved the demolition after sanctioning certain compensations. But the intermediate realignment proposal and its study only led to delay of three years, an RVNL source said. When the demolition is nearing completion now, the compensation claim has triggered some financial hiccups.
