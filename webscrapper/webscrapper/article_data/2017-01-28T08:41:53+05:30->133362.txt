BENGALURU: The city police drawing flak for their failure to respond promptly on New Year Eve revelry recently had their moment of pride. A woman stranded on a deserted stretch late last Thursday got the much-needed help by a traffic cop turned good Samaritan.

 In her Facebook post,  , a private firm employee, has written about the incident and tagged a photograph of assistant sub-inspector  , her saviour in distress.
 
 Nirmala was on her way home after work when her scooter's fuel ran out. She was stuck on the stretch of the road running alongside   between Doordarshan TV tower and   around 8.45pm. The stretch is deserted, poorly-lit and lined on the other side by properties belonging to the Army. The woman had no option but to call her husband and ask him to bring fuel.
 
 “Yesterday night I was riding home from office. I was stuck near TV tower when my scooter's fuel exhausted. I contacted my husband and was waiting for him to come with fuel when Mr Narayana, who was passing the stretch, asked me why I was waiting at such a lonely place,“ Nirmala said in her post. After she told the officer that she was waiting for her husband to bring fuel, he said the area was not safe. “He said it was not safe to wait at that location and gave his scoot er keys, asking me to go to Mehkri Circle, a safer place,“ she wrote. As she headed towards the circle, the 56-year-old officer pushed Nirmala's scooter till the circle, less than a km away .Later her husband was contacted and was directed towards Mehkri Circle. “My husband came with fuel and we were able to reach home safely. Mr. Narayana has set an example that police can be police and friendly too,“ Nirmala said.
 
 Narayana, an ASI with   traffic police station, said that all the appreciation he receives are like medals for him and as a cop it was his duty to help others.
