GHAZIABAD: A 55-year-old teacher was injured on Tuesday in Kavi Nagar area when two bike-borne robbers dragged her for several metres after snatching her handbag. The woman, Kalpana Chauhan, sustained bruises on her face, arms, legs and upper body, and was taken to a nearby hospital.

 The robbery took place around 3pm in M block, barely 200 metres from her residence in I block, when the woman was walking home as she had missed her school bus. Kalpana teaches in Bhagirath Public School in Sector 23, Sanjay Nagar.
 
 Her daughter Riya told TOI that the two men on bike came from behind, which caught her mother unawares.
 
 “My mother had loosely draped her stole around her face. The stole got entangled on the strap of the handbag which she had put on her right shoulder. The man riding pillion suddenly snatched the bag, while the one driving the bike accelerated. My mother fell on the road and got dragged for around 10 metres, before the strap of the bag broke. But by that time, she had been badly bruised. She immediately took a rickshaw back home,” said Riya.
 
 Soon after Kalpana reached home, her family informed the police. She was taken to Sarvodaya hospital where doctors discharged her after treatment. Kalpana told police that the man driving the bike had a helmet on his head, while the one riding pillion wore a black shirt. According to family members, the handbag contained Rs 5,000 and a few important documents.
 
 A complaint was filed at Kavi Nagar police station by the woman’s mother. “An FIR pertaining to loot has been registered against unknown persons. We are trying to find out whether any CCTV camera in the neighbourhood has captured the robbery,” said Samarjeet Singh, SHO, Kavi Nagar police station.
