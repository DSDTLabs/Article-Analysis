HYDERABAD: The Union budget had little for the   . All that farmers received “is just words and promises“, the   and Rytu Swarajya Vedika said on Wednesday .
In a statement, the two umbrella organisations for various farmers' welfare groups said, “Jaitley's budget lacked any roadmap or strategies to double farmers' income as was promised in last year's budget.“
 
 According to   of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, three critical is sues for farmers income security , relief from debt trap and support in times of disasters ­ were missing in the budget. He said farmers hopes for Remunerative Universal Price and Yield Assurance scheme were also dashed.
 
 Not a single step was incorporated to help farmers out in debt, Vissa said, adding the absence of measures to help small, marginal and tenant farmers with little access to institutional finance, was deeply troubling. Even more worrisome is the fact that farmers, who suffered two droughts, were not given any revival package, he said.
