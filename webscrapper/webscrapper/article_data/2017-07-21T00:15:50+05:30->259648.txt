Hyderabad: The Krishna water sharing dispute between Telangana and   is back to square one with the former demanding a meeting to be convened by the Union water resources ministry to decide on allocation. Telangana on Thursday dashed off a letter to the ministry seeking a share in the Pattiseema waters.

 Union water resources joint secretary, Sanjay Kundu, had earlier sought the response from the two states on continuing the water sharing agreement reached last year. This was mooted as the agreement had worked well for 2016-17 and the KWDT-II award has not been finalised yet even as the water year commenced on June 1.
 
 “We have no objection to sharing in the 299:512 TMC feet formula, but we want clarity over sharing in deficit and surplus years. We want the Centre’s clear stand on Pattiseema diversion. We are not for confrontation, but we will not compromise on state’s interests,” Shailendra Kumar Joshi, special chief secretary, irrigation department, told TOI.
 
 Andhra Pradesh has already agreed to follow last year’s sharing agreement and conveyed the same to the Centre.
 
 Telangana has been demanding a share in the water diverted through Pattiseema project by AP. As per the Bachawat Tribunal award, AP has to share Godavari waters with Maharashtra and Karnataka. Being an upper riparian state, Telangana is demanding a share of 45 TMC feet out of the total 80 TMC feet utilized by AP in Krishna Delta.
 
 During the lean season, the water sharing pattern has not been defined. As the water is being diverted by AP through Pothyreddipadu, Telangana has to wait a long time to get water at Nagarjunasagar. 
 
 “We will also raise the issue of drinking water for Hyderabad” said a senior official.
