Actor   is all set to reunite with his   director   for a new film,  . The 43-year-old actor is in negotiations to join the cast of crime-drama from Eastwood, who will also star in the film.
 
  
  
 This will be the 87-year-old legend's first film as an actor since 2012's sports drama 'Trouble With the Curve'. 'The Mule' is based on a 2014 story that tells the true story of 90-year-old WWII veteran and horticulturist Leo Sharp who became a drug courier for Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. 
 
 The film's story follows Earl Stone (Eastwood), a man in his 80s who is broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive - easy enough. But unbeknownst to Earl, he's signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel, and also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agent Colin Bates (Cooper). 
 
 Eastwood will also produce the project through his Malpaso banner and will be joined by Dan Friedkin and Bradley Thomas as co-producers. Ruben Fleischer, David Bernad, and Todd Hoffman are executive producing.
