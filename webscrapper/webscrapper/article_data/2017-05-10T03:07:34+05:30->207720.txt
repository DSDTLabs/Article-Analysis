ISLAMABAD: A shocked Pakistan on Tuesday summoned Iranian ambassador to its foreign office to record a formal protest over the statement by the Iranian army chief threatening to hit terrorist safe havens inside Pakistan if   failed to stop militants from carrying out cross-border attacks.

 Relations between Islamabad and   have been complex and full of mistrust since long. The two countries, however, had avoided aggressive posturing through public statements in the past. Hence, Pakistani officials were deeply shocked and disturbed, sources said, over the statement by Iranian military chief, Maj Gen Mohammad Baqeri, vowing his country would hit hideouts of terrorists in Pakistan if the government does not confront militants who carry out cross-border attacks.
 
 At least 10 Iranian border guards were killed in an ambush near the town of Mirjaveh in the southeastern Iranian province of   last month. Following the assault, the Jaish ul-Adl terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack.
 
 According to the foreign office, ambassador Mehdi Honardoost was told that remarks of his country’s army chief were against “against the spirit of brotherly relations existing between the two countries.”
 
 “The Iranian side was urged to avoid issuance of such statements that could vitiate the environment of fraternal relations,” the statement concluded.
 
 Incidentally, Iran’s defence minister was also quoted as saying, after a Saudi prince had threatened to move the “battle” to Iran, that Tehran would hit back at most of   with the exception of Makkah and Madina if the kingdom did anything in “ignorance”.
 
 Observers believe that Pakistan’s allowing former army chief   to lead a Saudi-led alliance against terrorism was the latest source of friction between the two countries.
 
 Earlier, Iran had expressed reservations on the Gen Sharif’s appointment as head of the Saudi-led 39-nation Islamic military alliance, stating that Tehran was not satisfied with the decision.
