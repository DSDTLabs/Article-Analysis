AHMEDABAD: Dressed in red and gold and blue,   brought to the   the buoyancy of sunrise blended with the ocean's solemnity. Those elemental traits -   and   - appeared to be yoked together in her presentation of  , on Sunday. To appreciate what rasikas experienced during her rendition, one will have to turn to literature. Lord Byron's lines from "She Walks in Beauty" might fit the chord of Sultana's achievement: "And all that's best of dark and bright/Meet in her aspect and her eyes". Indeed, her own expressiveness was as vital to the raga exposition as her musical expertise. 

 Sultana, the Patiala Gharana doyenne, emphasized Maru Bihag's chief propositions by using her hands like an orator mesmerizing audiences. Her fingers merely flickered when the raga whispered a secret. Her hands traced the arc of a rainbow when the notes ascended a distant summit. And when her sargam swayed the audience to breach concert convention and applaud mid-performance, she crowned her smile with her palms joining in a namaste gesture. 
 
 Sargam is a constellation of notes that supplant words. "Complicated and super-fast sargams are the specialty of the Patiala Gharana," Viraj Amar told TOI. Amar, a vocalist from Ahmedabad, is a disciple of Pandits Rajan and Sajan Mishra, the Banaras Gharana icons. "Sargam draws attention to the intricate patterns of a raga," she said.
 
 As for Maru Bihag, it is versatile enough to dominate the classical stage as well as produce pleasant ditties. An example of the latter is the 1960s hit, "Tum to pyar ho sajna". Manju Mehta, the Saptak custodian, told TOI: "The raga's mood, in my opinion, depends on the performer." It can be sombre or exuberant, she said. 
 
 "What we witnessed was a joyous rendition," Mehta said. In short, the festival started propitiously.
