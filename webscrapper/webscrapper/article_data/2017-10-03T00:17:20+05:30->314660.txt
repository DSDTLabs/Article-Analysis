NAVI MUMBAI: The once badly maintained   at   in Nerul has now been transformed and spruced up by the NMMC for the  , 2017. 

 The civic body’s engineering department, on Monday, confirmed that they have completed the work.
 
 “The ground is ready for the teams to practice. All of the work undertaken by the NMMC has been certified by the   committee as well,” said civic chief N Ramaswami.
 
 The NMMC has gone the extra mile to spruce up the Yashwantrao Chavan playground that will be used for training by some of the teams.
 
 Large scale civil work was undertaken on the ground in the last fifteen days. This included laying of the Bermuda grass, construction of storm water drains around the ground as well as laying circular pipeline underneath. “As per the norms of FIFA, there should not be any form of water accumulation in the playing area. So, for better percolation we have undertaken extensive pipeline work of the surrounding area as well. The ground has been paved using good quality material. So matches can be held during any season,” said NMMC city engineer Mohan Dagaonkar. 
 
 The NMMC has shelled out approximately Rs 2 core on the drainage work.
 
 “Unlike the norms of laying soil while developing a ground, for this playground sand has been used. So 10mm thick soil covering 150mm depth and 250mm thick sand has been spread across the area,” said an official from the NMMC’s engineering department.
 
 Meanwhile, the electricity department will be installing four high masts with 44 lights of 2,000 watts each. “It was challenging task to get the electricity work done in just 15 days as the fittings were to arrive from Italy. On each of the mast there are 11 bulbs and at 2,000 watts visibility shouldn’t be a factor,” said executive engineer (electricity) Sunil Lad.
