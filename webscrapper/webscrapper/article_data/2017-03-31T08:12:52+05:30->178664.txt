BHUBANESWAR:   (LWE) was the focal point of the unified command meeting on Wednesday. The officials discussed movement of forces to new locations in Kalahandi, Malkangiri, Koraput and Nuapada districts for anti-Maoist operations. Also, issues related to infrastructure development to set up camps for security forces were deliberated upon. 

 "There has been a noticeable decline in Maoist violence and activities. There was no major violence in the last few months except the Sunki ghat blast in February. Instances of Maoist violence during panchayat polls were also far less as compared to previous elections," said chief secretary A P Padhi.
 
 DGP K B Singh said besides operational issues, the officials also discussed development of infrastructure, road connectivity and communication that included setting up a mobile tower. Top officials from   (CRPF),   (BSF), state police and senior government officials were present.
 
 Progress of Gurupriya bridge in Malkangiri district was discussed at the meeting. It is likely to be completed by July, official sources said. The 910-metre bridge would provide direct connectivity to 151 villages in the cut-off areas in Malkangiri district. It would also help security forces intensify operations. 
 
 Top police officials said that emphasis was on joint combing operations with forces of neighbouring states, coordination between state and central forces and sharing of intelligence inputs from central agencies and other state governments.
 
 The state government decided to reiterate its demand before the Centre to sanction two more battalions of central armed police forces (CAPF) to Odisha.
 
 To tackle the Maoist menace, the Centre has deployed 17 battalions of central armed police forces, including eight each battalions of CRPF and BSF and one battalion of Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (COBRA), a specialized unit of the CRPF in the state.
