AHMEDABAD:   minister of state for home,  , said on Sunday that he had asked for papers of Gamar  . "I will first see the case papers and only then will it be decided whether a magistrate's inquiry is needed or a departmental inquiry will suffice," Jadeja said. 

 Lawyers, however, say that under Section 176 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), a judicial inquiry is mandatory in cases of custodial death. Eminent lawyer of Gujarat high court Girish Patel concurred. "A minister cannot even say he will see the papers to order an inquiry because the state machinery is bound by law, judgments of the apex court and guidelines of   to conduct an inquiry," he said.
 
 "Any custodial death case has a presumption that the accused might have died due to police violence. A judicial inquiry is the only tool that can reveal the truth," Patel said. 
 
 Shamshad Pathan, lawyer and human rights activist, also said judicial inquiry is necessary. "Whether the death of an accused occurs in police or judicial custody and even if it is accidental, a magisterial inquiry is compulsory. It is wrong to believe that minister has any say in the matter," Pathan said.
