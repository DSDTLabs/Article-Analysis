Puducherry: The Centralized Admission Committee ( ) will on September 18 hold the final phase of counselling for admission into BSc (agriculture/horticulture) and   courses on the committee office premises.

 The committee will hold counselling for BSc (agriculture/horticulture) for candidates from the Union territory at 9am, followed by counselling for LLB courses for other state candidates at 9.30am and for candidates from the Union territory at 9.45am.
 
 The committee said the candidates must produce all original certificates and one set of photocopies of the documents, besides a demand draft for a non-refundable fee of Rs 750 (Rs 350 for SC/ST candidates) drawn in favour of the Convener, Centac, payable at Puducherry.
 
 The committee will call students in batches in order of merit and if seats are filled within those batches, the committee will not call remaining students. 
 
 “Hence students should be aware of the procedure and attend the counselling at their own choice. Mere call letter will not entitle them for counselling, as the same is subject to availability of seats,” the committee said.
