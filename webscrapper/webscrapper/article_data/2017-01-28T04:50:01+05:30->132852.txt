NAVI MUMBAI:  , Kharghar, designed on the lines of London’s  , is under phase-II of development. 

 Last week, Cidco tendered the project to select a strategic partner to develop it as an ideal theme park.
 
 The project, to be implemented on a   (BOT) basis, will be handled by the operator to develop the park and ensure its financial viability. The park spreads across an area of 80 hectares or 200 acres. 
 
 Though phase-II involves work on 55 hectares, the entire park could be handed over for integrating the various features incorporated in phase-I after which the park was opened in 2010.
 
 Mohan Ninawe, senior PRO (Cidco), told TOI on Friday, “The park can have replicas of forts in Maharashtra, heritage buildings, fun rides and food courts among others. It will be developed on the lines of amusement parks like Essel World or Imagica”
 
 The green space will be a perfect hangout for families and individuals with diverse interests in sports, debates, walks and various indulgences close to nature as in the famous and historic Hyde Park. 
 
 Besides, its location — opposite the green acres of golf course and the proposed BKC-II (corporate park, Kharghar) for which Cidco has floated the global tender last week to select an architect — will make the park a much sought-after venue.
 
 Hyde Park has many features of being a getaway for families and is also a famous meeting centre. It is a signature address in London.
