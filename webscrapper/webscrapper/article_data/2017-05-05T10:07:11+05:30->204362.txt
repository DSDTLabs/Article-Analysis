KOTTAYAM:  , Kottayam, started coaching students for   in 2011, but for the first time there was not a single girl student who appeared for the   in the batch of 99 because they had no means to provide accommodation for eligible girls.

 The school, in the last two years saw an increase in the number of girl students who seek admission in class VI. Earlier, less than 30% girl students sought admission in class VI in the boarding school. Now more than 50% students in the campus are girls.
 
 As the number of girls in campus has increased accommodation has become a problem and the school authorities have stopped accepting any girl for IIT coaching as they don't have space in the girl's dormitory.
 
 As of today, 42 of the 80 students studying in class VI are girls. The dormitory for girls is now overcrowded. There was a time when JNV failed to attract girl students and they kept 30% reservation for girls.
 
 “With a huge rush of regular girl students to the school, we are unable to accommodate girl students who are selected by  ,“ said school principal G Beena.
 
 JNV administration has already sanctioned funds to build a dormitory that can accommodate 48 more girls and 98 boys in the campus. A fund of Rs 50 lakh has been sanctioned, however, CPWD is yet to start work.
 
 “We are planning to take up the matter with the commissioner. There is a great demand from parents to admit girl students. Parents here want their daughters to excel in education.But we are not able to admit many due to lack of adequate dormitory facility for girls,“ added Beena.
