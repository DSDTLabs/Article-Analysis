HYDERABAD: If the TRS government has its way in the ensuing   2017-18, then   will find itself in   six years down the line. This is because the state government has chalked out an ambitious plan for the coming fiscal wherein it wants to spend at least Rs 100 crore to increase   by taking up plantation of 2 crore palm palmyra and palm trees.

 Officials did not rule out the possibility of the Telangana government flooding the market with neera tetra packs in the long run.Neera is the first stage product having medicinal values derived out of palm trees.Incidentally , the Kerala and Karnataka governments are already marketing the product. The excise department has planted 54.9 lakh palm trees in 2016 as part of Haritha Haram, and another 2 crore saplings in 2017 will take the tally to 2.54 crore palm trees or 'Eetha chetlu' as the palm trees are locally known.
 
 There are multiple benefits of taking up plantation of such a large number of palm trees. The chief one, according to officials, is that availability of huge quantities of genuine toddy will put a stop to adulteration and check deaths of people who fall victim to adulterated toddy . “Another main objective is to put an end to manufacturing of illicit liquor, i.e., gudumba. These trees would also provide employment and revenue to lakhs of families of toddy tappers,“ excise principal secretary Somesh Kumar told TOI. In all, the government plans to plant 5 crore palm saplings by the 2018-19 fiscal, and going by the 80 per cent survival rate observed in the 2016-17 financial year, there would be at least 4 crore palm trees that would start giving yield in six years from the date of being planted. Every palm tree starts giving yield after six years of growth.
 
 Along with plantation of saplings, the government is planning rehabilitation of 7,866 families who have been removed or convinced to quit the profession of manufacturing illicit liquor.
