VASCO: Verna police on Wednesday arrested eight persons who were allegedly involved in a fight that broke out at Zuarinagar in the aftermath of the state assembly elections held earlier on February 4. 

 The list includes Dashrat Biradar, Vijay Naik, Mehboob Walikar, Siddu Naik, Yallappa Gaudar, Manjunath Hanumanth Navli, Shivanna Girniwadar, and Chinna Chinmal.
 
 The main accused in the incident — Sancoale panch   and   candidate   — may also be arrested shortly, police sources said, adding that they are also on the lookout for several others who were also reportedly involved in the incident.
 
 Rangappa’s bike and Rodrigues’ car were involved in an accident on Tuesday and the vehicles had collided into each other. This set off an altercation which resulted in a full-blown BJP-Congress brawl. Four Congress supporters, eight BJP supporters, two women, one minor and five men were injured in the stoning that ensued. Soon after, BJP filed a complaint which was followed by one from Congress later in the night.
 
 The accused have been arrested under Sections 143, 147, 323, 324, 427, 504 read with Section 49 of Indian Penal Code and Section 8 of Goa Children’s Act.
