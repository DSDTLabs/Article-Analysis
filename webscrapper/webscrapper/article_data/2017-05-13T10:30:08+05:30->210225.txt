SALEM: The   government has failed to save the   from privatisation, alleged former chief minister   

 Speaking at a well-attended meeting of AIADMK cadres here on Friday, Panneerselvam compared the steps taken by former   J Jayalalithaa in preventing privatisation of NLC to those being taken by the Palaniswami regime. "Amma stopped privatisation of NLC by purchasing its shares but the present government under Palaniswami has failed to prevent privatisation of the Salem Steel Plant. If Amma had been alive, she would have ensured that Kia Motors set up its unit in  ," said Panneerselvam. 
 
 At the second stop of his state-wide tour, the former chief minister criticised the Palaniswami government in a major part of his speech. "The chief minister claims he signed 1,500 files. Is it not the job of a chief minister to sign files on a daily basis. I have also signed thousands of files but I did not claim I signed so many files as it is part of my job," said Panneerselvam taking a dig at his successor. 
 
 Stating that the assembly elections are not far away and it could be even before local body elections, the former chief minister said his group will not attempt to topple the government. "The government has not fulfilled promises made in the AIADMK manifesto released on the eve of the 2016 Assembly elections. Just with 122 MLAs, the government thinks it can survive for the remaining term of the assembly. But when M G Ramachandran came out of the DMK, he had only 1 MLA supporting him," said Panneerselvam. 
 
 Meanwhile, the group has presented more affidavits to the Election Commission in support of their claim of the two leaves symbol, which remains frozen.
