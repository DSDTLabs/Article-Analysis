NEW DELHI:   mayor   and other leaders have moved a resolution against the   for rejecting their proposal of merging two of its   and creating a new one on Thursday.

 Agarwal along with others announced that if the government failed to notify their proposal within two days, they would stage a protest outside chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence.
 
 The government on Wednesday had notified the zones for south and east corporations but rejected the proposal of north corporation, which had proposed a merger of Sadar Paharganj and City zone and creation of Keshavpuram. 
 
 “The proposal was rejected on flimsy grounds. We had proposed the merger to balance the number of wards in each zone. It is important that each zone has even distribution of resources and manpower and it will happen only when the number of wards is balanced in each zone,” Agarwal said, adding that if the proposal was not cleared within a week, the corporation would move the court. 
 
 Congress leader Mukesh Goel supported the resolution and said, “BJP should have acted long back. It has been three months since the elections got over and committees are yet to be formed.”
 
 However, leader of opposition and AAP member Rakesh Kumar slammed BJP for intervening in government’s work instead of focusing on civic issues.North corporation commissioner PK Gupta said as per the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, the civic body was authorised to create zones and the government only had to notify the proposal.
 
 “We had sent the proposal and whenever any query was raised we had ensured that it was addressed immediately. But the government cannot reject the proposal. As per the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, civic body has the power to create zones,” said Gupta.
