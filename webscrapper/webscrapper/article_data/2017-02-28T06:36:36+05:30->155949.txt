BENGALURU: The government on Monday indicated that preschools will be brought under the  , 1983, and schools teaching toddlers must register with the  . A draft proposal proposes stiff penalties for schools which flout rules. 

 The step comes in the wake of an office assistant allegedly molesting at least eight toddlers in a   earlier this month.
 
 On February 16, parents of a three-and-a-half-year-old girl lodged a police complaint that their child was sexually abused by a non-teaching employee on the school premises in Bellandur. 
 
 The school is a franchisee of a known chain, and was owned by an individual.
 
  Sowjanya,  , said, "The school (in question) isn't registered with the education department. According to a 2005 rule, it was not mandatory for individually-owned preschools to register with the department. The 2005 order will soon cease to exist as we've started the process to amend the act." 
 
 Preschools, including lower and upper kindergarten classes, come under the education department. Creches and daycare centers which take care of children aged 3 months to 4 years are under the department of women and child development.
 
  "We introduced the Child Protection Policy five months ago, and we want to include major parts of that policy into the Act amendment. Owners or franchisees must register with the zonal block educational officer by paying a fee of Rs 2,000 and the registration process may take about a week," an official said. 
 
 The education department is yet to respond to Bengaluru police, who are investigating Pocso charges against the Bellandur preschool staffer accused of abusing toddlers.
