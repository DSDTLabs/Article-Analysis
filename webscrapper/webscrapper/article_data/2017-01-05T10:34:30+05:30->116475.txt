BELAGAVI: The   order banning liquor shops on highways has come as a major relief to   where nearly 691   cases were registered from January to November, 2016. Worse, 573 people lost their lives on national and state highways in the district in drunken driving related accidents.

 Launching a drive against drunken driving, district police personnel booked 691 motorists for drinking beyond the permissible limit and collected Rs 7.4 lakh as penalty. Most of the accidents take place in the night or the wee hours and non-availability of emergency medical services proves fatal for the seriously-injured victims. Experts said that easy access to liquor at dhabas and hotels located beside highways also contribute to the rise in alcohol-related accidents.
 
 On national highways, nearly 107 people died on the spot or succumbed to injuries in the hospital. Over 97 suffered injuries, causing permanent disability. On state highways, 305 died and 271 people were injured in the past 11 months. Nearly 161 deaths were reported from the district and rural approach roads.
 
 “We need strong social security measures. Accidents kill breadwinners and this puts extra burden on the dependents or survivors in the family,” says sociology professor SH Patil.
