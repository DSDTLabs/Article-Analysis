PATNA: Around 500 villagers torched Barhara police station in Bihar’s   district, approximately 80km from Patna, on Sunday in protest against a man’s death in police custody. Seven people have been arrested in the case.

 The villagers burnt nine police jeeps and an equal number of two-wheelers, besides seven seized vehicles parked on the police station premises. Fourteen policemen were injured and files were destroyed in the mob attack. The condition of one constable was stated to be serious.
 
 Barhara circle officer Sumit Kumar, who arrived at the police station after learning about the villagers’ protest, had a narrow escape as a bullet fired by an unidentified person in the mob struck his vehicle’s windscreen. Sources said one Ram Sajjan Prasad (45), alias Chenna Prasad, of   was arrested on Saturday night and died within hours in custody. “Prasad was arrested in an inoxicated state by ASI Arvind Kumar. Prasad’s daughter, Neetu Kumari, had lodged an FIR accusing him of sexually harassing her whenever her mother was away. After being in the lock-up for some time, Prasad started banging his head against against the iron bars in the lock-up,” a police official said.
 
 He said Prasad was removed from the lock-up to avoid injury. “Soon after he was taken out, he attempted to escape and went to the terrace of the three-storey police station building. When a couple of police personnel chased him, Prasad jumped off the terrace and died,” he said.
 
 DIG (Shahabad range) Mohammad Rahman said Barhara SHO Sudeh Kumar and ASI Pandey had been suspended for dereliction of duty. “The SHO failed to assess the situation and ask his seniors for reinforcements when the mob blocked the road in front of the police station to protest against Prasad’s death,” the DIG said.
