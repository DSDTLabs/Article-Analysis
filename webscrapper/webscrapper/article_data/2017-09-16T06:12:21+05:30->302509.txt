SRINAGAR: A day after two Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists were gunned down by security forces on the outskirts of Srinagar, the Army said on Friday it would take action against the soldiers who were allegedly involved in disrespecting the the slain terrorists’ bodies. 

 The Army’s response came after a video went viral in which soldiers are seen dragging the bodies of the terrorists —   and   — with ropes tied to their legs. In the video, soldiers are also seen resting their foot on the chests of the two terrorists who were Pakistani nationals. Abu Ismail was the mastermind of the attack on Amarnath yatris in July in which eight pilgrims were killed. 
 
 “We have taken cognisance of the video and suitable action will follow,” defence ministry spokesman Col. Rajesh Kalia said. 
 
 The video went viral on Thursday soon after the encounter ended. On Friday, authorities imposed restrictions in Nowhatta, Gojwara, Bohri Kadal and Rajouri Kadal in downtown Srinagar to pre-empt any trouble. People offered prayers in absentia for Abu Ismail and Chotta Qasim at Pampore after the Friday namaz. Apprehending trouble, authorities had shut schools in Srinagar and Ganderbal districts. 
 
 Reacting to the video, LeT spokesman Mehmood Shah said: “The inhuman treatment of martyrs’ bodies by the Indian forces is unethical and unacceptable. India is promoting inhuman culture which would cause it a great loss. We will take revenge for our martyrs.”
