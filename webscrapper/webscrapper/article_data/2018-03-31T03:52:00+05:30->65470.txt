Ahmedabad: A total of 64 teams started the 36-hour   on Friday as part of Smart India Hackathon grand finale in Ahmedabad. Gujarat Technological University (GTU) in collaboration with ISRO are hosts for the Ahmedabad nodal centre of the event which is taking place at the premises of Shivanand Ashram in Satellite.

 While Gujarat has one team in the event, 32 other teams from the state have gone to other centres to participate in the problem-solving contest. The event at Ahmedabad has seen participation from 17 states and a union territory to work on projects in collaboration with ISRO, said an organizer.
 
 PM Narendra Modi interacted with the participants at five nodal centres through video conferencing on Friday. Nidhi Bhandari, a student from Chennai, gave an outline of her teamâ€™s project where they intend to use satellite data to find the shortest route to ensure best connectivity in Uttarakhand. Modi lauded the effort and gave example of how his government used BISAG data to ensure school network in all rural areas when he was Gujarat CM.
 
 Nilesh Kevlani, an engineering student from Ahmedabad, told Modi how his team is trying to find a solution of ensuring non-duplication of geo-tagging data. The proposed technology will be able to detect if the same place is photographed from different angles to show different beneficiaries of the same government scheme. tnn
