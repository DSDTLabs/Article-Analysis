NEW DELHI: As the verbal fight between Delhi government and the   continues, deputy chief minister Manish   on Wednesday accused LG Anil   of “stalling the constitution of Delhi’s Waqf Board” without any valid reason. The action has hampered the board’s functioning and its reforms and deprived the Imams of various mosques of their salaries, Sisodia said.

 The   was dissolved by former LG Najeeb Jung over charges of “irregularities” in 2016. Since then the seven-member board has not been constituted.
 
 “LG has cited the high court order for stalling the constitution of the board. But nowhere did the HC say that the board should not be constituted. The court had asked the LG to put on hold the appointment of only the seventh member of the board, but Baijal stopped the formation of the board instead,” Sisodia alleged.
 
 Three members of the board are elected while four are nominated. The names of three elected members were also cleared by the LG in December 2017, he said.
 
 “Why do the LGs (the previous and the current) want to run Waqf Board themselves or through officers? There are gangs who have encroached on the lands of the board and they don’t want an elected government to run it,” he said.
 
 An official said that since it came to power the AAP government has been continuously waging a struggle against the land mafia to free the board’s properties from their control. Sisodia said the removal of the encroachment from the board lands has stopped after the board was dissolved.
 
 The   has not yet responded to the allegations. Till late in the night, there was no reaction from LG’s office.
