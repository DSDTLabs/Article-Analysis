NAGPUR:   have decreased by 15% in 2016 as compared to 2015, despite a dramatic rise from August to October, when the numbers peaked at 68 cases a month. Positive cases recorded in December have come down to four, with total 195 positive cases in 2016 as against 230 cases recorded in 2015.

  officer   said, “Our department has been consistently taking up surveys and awareness campaigns. This year, we started the activities in the summer itself. We visited houses, schools, hospitals and other institutions, and pinpointed larva breeding spots like water filled in tanks, flower pots etc and also issued notices to premises owners. This continuous effort, which involved   showed significant results.”
 
 In 2016, there was just one  , which was recorded during October, while 2015 had accounted for two deaths, recorded in September and October. In 2016, only 10 cases were seen between January and July, while 148 out of 195 positive cases were recorded between August and October. After that, the cases decreased and only 33 cases were recorded in November.
 
 On the other hand, in 2015, the number of cases was comparatively high in every month. Before July had ended, there had been 15 cases recorded. Total 163 of the cases were recorded between August and October, after which the number of cases had reduced to 42. The positive cases further went down to 10 with the start of winter.
 
 Thote said, “During June and July, the cases are less since the consistent rain ensures the water collected in pots and tanks does not get a chance to maintain a still surface. It often gets disturbed due to rains or winds. Moreover, it is difficult for larva to breed in abundant water. Larva develop when most of the water gets evaporated after rains, and only a small quantity remains in any kind of container.”
 
 She said, “Similarly, as the atmosphere becomes colder in December, the larva’s lifespan and mosquito’s viral capacity both reduce at the same time. We are not expecting any further rise in positive cases in the coming months.”
 
 The data shows positive cases of malaria have also decreased by 40% in 2016 as compared to 2015. As against 24 positive cases recorded throughout 2016, 46 cases were recorded in 2015.
 
 Like dengue, most of the positive cases in malaria were between August and October. During 2016, 14 out of 24 positive cases were recorded. While in 2015, the rise in positive cases started to show up from July itself, when seven cases had tested positive. There have been no deaths due to malaria in last two years.
