DHARWAD: The   (HDMC) has announced 5%   if it is paid in full before April 30. It also announced 24% penalty per month — subject to a maximum of 48% for one year — if the tax is paid after June 30. The citizens wanting to take advantage of the concession visit the   zonal offices, only to be disappointed as there is no staff to issue challan. The common reason: operators concerned are on election duty.

 The HDMC has given PID numbers to properties and uploaded the details to the computer. However, all the properties are not uploaded. Despite the announcement of assembly elections, the HDMC did not take steps to update the details of property tax before April 1.
 
 “The HDMC officials knew that Karnataka will have elections in April/May and still they announced the offer of  . Now, there are only 10 working days left for the citizens to pay the tax and enjoy the benefit of concession, there is bound to be heavy rush at the counters even if the HDMC starts issuing challans immediately. However, there are no signs of HDMC issuing the challans. It should now allow us to have a rebate on tax for payment made in May. It is the only solution,” said H V Kakhandiki, a senior citizen.
 
 Mayor   said there is no scope for extending the deadline to avail of concession to May. He said that despite instructions, the HDMC commissioner failed to ensure adequate staff.
