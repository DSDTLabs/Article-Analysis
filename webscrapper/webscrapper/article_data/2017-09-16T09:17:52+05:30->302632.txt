BENGALURU: As many as 60 pourakarmikas working in   filed a complaint against their   on Friday for fraudulently taking their signatures on a document supporting the contract system of employment.

 The document is believed to have said the signatories have received all their dues from the contractor and that the pourakarmikas prefer their payments be made through the contractors, instead of depositing the money in their bank accounts.
 
 According to the workers, they were misled and forced to sign the document. They feared that they might lose their jobs if they did not do as told. But since none of them is literate, they were unable to tell what they were signing. As of now, the contractor has not paid them for the last three months.
 
 Rajeshwari, 29, a civic worker, said they were contacted on Tuesday and told to gather at   the next morning. “We turned up at 6am and he got us all to sign on a paper that only had our names, phone numbers and our PF account numbers. It was only when we asked someone from the   that we realized what we had signed,“ she said.
 
 A complaint of cheating and fraud has been filed with under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.
 
 Venkatamma, who has been working for the contractor for 17 years, said due to irregular payments many of them have to survive on loans. “We get our salary one month and then go without it for two months. We take loans with 10% interest and when salary comes, all the money goes clearing the interest, leaving nothing for household expenses,“ she said.
 
 Maitreyi Krishnan, executive member of the BBMP Guttige Pourakarmikara Sangha, said the document the pourakarmikas were forced to sign is in direct contravention to recent state government guidelines mandating direct payment to their bank accounts.
