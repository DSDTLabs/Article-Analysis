MUMBAI: The   assessment and collector department has decided to send out property tax bills to an individual flat owner in Mumbai, instead of sending consolidated ones to an entire housing society. This new rule will apply to only those buildings that receive an occupation certificate (OC) after April 2018. 

 BMC officials said they have received complaints from flat owners about how even after they had paid their property tax on time to their respective cooperative housing society, but the office-bearers had not remitted the same to the BMC. Flat owners are held liable for the arrears, although they have made the payments to their society. 
 
 The BMC has decided to send individual tax bills ensure that there is no miscommunication. "The rule currently was that if flat owners wanted to get their property tax bills individually from the BMC they would need to get a no-objection certificate from the housing society society. Owners of flats and commercial establishments coming up in new buildings will not need an NOC. However, the   stipulation will apply in case of residents of old societies," said an official. In Mumbai, there are currently 2.75 lakh properties which are assessed. Around 1.4 lakh property owners have already got the BMC to dispatch property tax bills individually after receiving an NOC from their respective society. "The BMC has also made it clear that henceforth payment of property tax for properties, which are not sold to anyone would be paid by the builder concerned," the official added.
