NEW DELHI: Suspended   (AAP) member   today told a party colleague that not only did he witness party chief   accept Rs 2 crore, he also has "details" about the alleged exchange of cash with AAP leader  .

 Responding to colleague  's letter, in which he threatened to go on a hunger strike - to protest the suspended leader's allegations - Mishra told him "drink plenty of water." 
 
 Mishra - who says he entered his fourth day of a hunger strike today - tweeted both letters this morning. 
 
 Jha wrote to him asking him why he hasn't yet submitted any proof of this alleged transaction. In his reply letter, Mishra said the "details" he has are his "strength" and that he doesn't want to lose this advantage by making them public.
 
 In his letter, Jha told Mishra "it appears you're lying". He was referring to the Rs 2 crore allegation. Mishra said that he witnessed that transaction on May 5.
 
 "You tell us, at what time and in which vehicle did you go to the chief minister's (Kejriwal's) house. Also tell us, did you get there first or did Satyendar Jain?" Jha asked in the letter.
 
 Yesterday, Mishra claimed his next "expose" will rattle the people of Delhi who "trusted the Aam Aadmi Party". He reiterated that assertion in today's letter.
 
 In addition to the allegation about the Rs 2 crore alleged transaction, Mishra has demanded details on how some AAP leaders' foreign trips were funded.
 
 Today, Mishra said "details of these foreign trips will reveal something dark that's been hidden."
