There is nothing about Indian   that   has missed in the past few months. The TV actor, who plays a ‘star cricketer’ in the his upcoming show  , has been watching cricket matches and following   to prep for his role. Dheeraj, who is from  , says he has been fond of cricket since childhood: "I used to play a lot of cricket in school and was the captain of my school cricket team. Now, I’ve got a chance to live those school days by playing a cricketer on-screen."

  Dheeraj’s character in the show is a lot like Virat Kohli as he explains, "The character that I play is flamboyant, stylish and has a huge fan following. He knows he is successful and has a distinct attitude (not necessarily negative). Now when you hear that, only Virat Kohli comes to your mind. It is rare to get a chance to play a character like that on TV .I had gone to Maldives for my honeymoon and one of my fans came to me at the airport and told me that I resembled Virat. I think he said that because of my beard, and it is such a coincidence that I’m getting to play someone who is a lot like Virat."

  The actor says that he has always been a fan of Virat. "I know that some people think he is too aggressive on field. But I think, some amount of aggression is required on field in a game like cricket. Virat knows his game and that’s the only thing that matters."
 
  Talking about childhood days in Bareilly, he says," I still miss every bit of my childhood and college days in Bareilly. I loved zooming around in areas like Civil Lines, Rampur Garden and Cantonment on my bike. I miss   wali chaat and pav bhaji and I think I can’t ever forget the taste of   and Kipps sweet. I’m in touch with my school and college friends and meet them whenever I come to the town. Since, I keep talking about Bareilly so much, my wife, who is from Mumbai, is also enticed to visit the city."
