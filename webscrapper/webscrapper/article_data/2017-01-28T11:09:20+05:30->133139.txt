NAGPUR: Tejram Vahane, a 39-year-old farmer from   committed suicide on Monday. His brother said it was due to repeated losses in farming. A slump in tomato rates sowed in his fields due to ban on the notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination was also one of the reasons, he said.

 Father of three girls aged 12, 9 and 3 years, Tejram is survived by married brother and parents in their eighties besides wife and children. Nagpur is not known to be a farm suicide-prone district, like neighbouring Wardha or Amravati. 
 
 Shilmanju Vahane, brother of the deceased, said that there were losses since the last 4 years. This left Tejram dejected, leading him to take the extreme step. tnn
 
 “Even as cotton rates are favourable this year, the output at our farm was negligible. There was a major area under tomato but the rates slid to just a rupee due to note-ban. This led to a major loss. Even soybean rates are low this year,” Shilmanju said.
