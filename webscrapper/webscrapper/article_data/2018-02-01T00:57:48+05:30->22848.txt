NEW DELHI: The Delhi government has told all   vehicle owners to have functional   in their vehicles by  .

 Under a special drive starting March 1, the transport department will issue challans, cancel permits and impound vehicles if anyone is found to be violating the order. A notice has been issued in this regard. 
 
 In 2009, the government had made it mandatory for all autos and taxis to have functional GPS devices. All public transport vehicles, including autos, taxis, buses, gramin sewas etc, plying in Delhi under permits issued by the department are required to have GPS devices. As part of permit conditions, the owners of these vehicles also have to ensure that the device is in a working condition. Even if a vehicle is stationary or parked and there is no signal from its GPS device, it is considered non-activation of GPS. 
 
 The transport department recently set up an operations control centre where all public transport vehicles are monitored through GPS tracking. A latest summary report prepared by the department revealed that nearly 75% of all public transport vehicles in Delhi don’t have functional GPS devices.
 
 “We are preparing a list of vehicles that don’t have functional GPS for the last three months or more. These vehicles will be targeted,” said a transport department official. “In the next phase, we will crack down on vehicles that don’t have functional GPS for more than two months. In the coming days, we would be more stringent and reports will be maintained on vehicles with non-functional GPS devices...to be updated every 10 days,” he said.
