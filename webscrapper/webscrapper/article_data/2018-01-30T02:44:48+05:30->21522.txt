NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old man was arrested from Dwarka sector-20 on Sunday evening in connection with the double murder of a woman and her 17-year-old son on January 14, in southwest Delhi’s Palam.

 The accused,   alias Bony, is the brother-in-law of the woman,  .
 
 DCP (Dwarka)   said   told officers that he killed his brother’s wife and her son   due to a dispute over the property where they were staying.
 
 The joint family lived in a three-storey house in Palam. While Joshi lived with his father, wife and two children on the second floor, his elder brother Praveen Kumar lived on the first floor with wife Deepa and three children.
 
 The dispute was over the ownership of the ground floor. It was rented out for commercial use and both Joshi and Deepa wanted the rent money.
 
 Joshi said that Deepa used to fight with the tenants he used to bring and would tell him that she was the owner. Their relationship further deteriorated when Joshi was reportedly attacked in February 2017, by unidentified men. He was stabbed multiple times.
 
 Joshi alleged that Deepa was behind the attack. He said that Rishi also got involved in scuffles with him a few times. The accused then procured a country-made pistol from   and kept it with himself all the time.
 
 On January 14, Joshi got into an argument with Rishi over laying of a cable on the first floor. The heated exchange soon escalated and Joshi fired at Rishi, hitting him in the chest and killing him instantly.
 
 Joshi went downstairs and waited for his sister-inlaw, who had gone out of the house. He started arguing with Deepa as soon as she came and shot her in the temple before fleeing.
 
 Police said that the accused then kept changing his hideouts. He was arrested when he came back to Delhi, with the plan to kill one more person, whom he suspected to be a co-planner in the attack on him.
