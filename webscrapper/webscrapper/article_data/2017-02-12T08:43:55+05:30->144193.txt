PATIALA: Captain   Singh Jaijee (retd), grandson of freedom fighter and the leader of the Praja Mandal Movement Sewa Singh Thikriwala, got bail on Saturday in the case of wrongful restraint and criminal intimidation. The case was filed on the complaint of former Army chief General  , who is Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) candidate from   assembly constituency.

 Amarjit appeared at the Patiala Civil Lines police station, along with his lawyer Brijinder Sodhi and filed for bail, which was granted on the spot. Later speaking to the newspersons, Sodhi said they would move an application with the local police seeking action against the General for violating the Army code as he went around in Patiala wearing his medals. These could be worn only on certain occasions and could not be used to influence the electorate, the lawyer said.
 
 He said Captain Jaijee had only stopped a group of politicians from removing the garlands put on the statue by the panchayat of Thikriwala’s native village on the occasion of his birthday on January 19.
 
 Singh was not allowed to garland Thikriwala’s statue during his election campaign following which he had filed a complaint with the local police. Patiala police registered the case on February 8.
 
 The Army ex-chief had stated that the Amarjit was working at the behest of Punjab Congress chief Captain   and besides disrupting his election campaign, he had also tried to intimidate him.
