THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: It is curious to note the similarities between the   murders and the mass murder that happened in Amityville  , New York. On November 13, 1974, 23-year-old   shot and killed six of his family members-father, mother, two brothers and two sisters. 

 Like Cadell Jeanson Raja,   too was the eldest son in the family. Though he initially alleged that his family was massacred by a mob hitman, the police soon exposed his lies after cross questioning. He was sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment for each of the murders he committed though he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.
 
 After a preliminary interrogation that went on for almost 24 hours, the police assumed that the bitter feelings Raja harboured against his father for relentlessly dissing him over his 'failure' in life resulted in the murders. Defoe too had told something similar to the police. He said that he overheard his parents conspiring to kill him and so he went ahead and killed them first to save himself. 
 
 The   murders went on to inspire several books and even Hollywood films like "The Amityville Horror".
 
 Deputy commissioner of police   said that Cadell was heavily into violent animated movies and video games and that Fallout, a post-apocalyptic role-playing game was his favourite one. 
 
 ''Being someone who was heavily inspired by pop culture there are chances he derived inspiration from any one of the adaptations of the murders," said the DCP.
