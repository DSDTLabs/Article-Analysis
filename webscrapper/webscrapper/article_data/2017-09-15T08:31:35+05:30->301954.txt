LUCKNOW: Friday is last date for around 16,000   to upload their details on the portal of the  . By Thursday , only 50%   had registered on the portal, which was launched on August 18 by   for   Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary .

 Out of the 8,000 that have registered, only 1,500 madrassas have put up details including information about their 2,800 teachers. Of the 560 madrassas receiving grant-in-aid from the government, only 225 have filled in their details.
 
 The portal was launched to weed out bogus madrassas and to bring transparency in the system but it has received weak response. The madrassa teachers' association and board officials have both accepted that stakeholders' hesitation from going online and technical problems have combined to hamper the process.
 
 “Many problems were faced by those attempting to register, like passwords generated by them getting rejected by the portal, while there was no option to delete multiple entri es made mistakenly . Besides, not every teacher had an Aadhar number and could not get it either at such a short notice,“ said Eijaz Ahmed, president, Islamic Madarsa Modernisation Teachers' Association.
 
 “There is some hesitation among them but madrassa owners and staff must know that the process is only to make the system transparent,“ said Rahul Gupta, registrar of the UP Board of Madrassa Education, adding, that there were internet connectivity issues sometimes but those affected could always approach him, or the district minorities officer, or use either of the two helplines.
