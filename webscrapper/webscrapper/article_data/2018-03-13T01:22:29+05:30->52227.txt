NEW DELHI:  , Aam Aadmi Party  , moved a private member’s Bill in the upper House on Monday, seeking an end to the   drive in the city. He also urged all political parties to come together to pass the Bill. However, because enactment is a long process, Singh’s bill is unlikely to be taken up for discussion in the current session of  

 At a press conference at   office, Singh said only 14 private member bills have been passed since Independence, but hoped his would be cleared by Parliament. 
 
 He pointed out that despite repeated appeals by his party leaders, including Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, the Union government had not brought in an ordinance or a Bill to stop the sealing to provide relief to the traders.
 
 “Sealing has impacted the livelihood of traders and pushed them to hunger,” the MP said. “The only solution to end the ongoing sealing is through an ordinance. Since BJP and Congress have been claiming they are with the traders, why can’t a Bill be introduced on the matter?” He also suggested that amendments to the existing law could help avoid the sealing of business establishments.
 
 Condemning the physical assault on some traders by police during a recent sealing drive in Amar Colony in south Delhi, Singh claimed that the police acted “barbarically” with the traders. 
 
 Along with the other two AAP Rajya Sabha members, Sushil Gupta and N D Gupta, Singh also wrote a letter to Union home minister Rajnath Singh to complain about the “barbaric behaviour” of Delhi Police personnel and appealed to him to help the traders get relief from sealing.
