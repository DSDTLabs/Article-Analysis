Surat: The detection of crime branch (DCB) and special operations group (SOG) raided Janta Market on Raj Marg on Wednesday and seized 373 mobile phones for verification. The market has been raided in the past too for dealing in stolen phones and mobiles, which are traded in grey market. 

 Even as police tried to keep the information about the raid under wraps, a number of shopkeepers in the narrow lanes of market got a whiff and escaped after closing their premises. 
 
 Police searched around 50 shops and large number of mobile phones were found in 11 of them. The shop owners could not produce documents for the phones, which were then seized for verification.
 
 “It was a raid to identify those dealing in stolen and used mobiles. The mobile phone traders are supposed to maintain data of sellers and buyers. They should stop buying stolen phones to help police control the crime,” in-charge deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Bipin Ahire said. After scrutiny police, did not find proper documentation of 112 mobile phones. Police booked four shop owners Mohammad Noor Hanif, Faizal Rafiq Memon, Mohsin Yunis Bagdiwala and Muzeb Yunis Memon, from whom the phones were recovered.
 
 Police commissioner Satish Sharma said, “We have issued a notification instructing the mobile traders to maintain proper record of buyer and sellers with documents. It was found that many are not maintaining and therefore the raids were conducted to nab those dealing in stolen phones. Those found dealing in stolen phones or mobiles without proper documentation will be booked.”
 
 In all, 60 policemen, six police sub-inspectors and one police inspector were part of the raiding team led by police inspector, DCB, P L Chaudhary. 
 
 “It is an important move by the police as some people are running entire network of trade in stolen or smuggled mobile phones from Janta Market. Due to this, those doing business honestly are badly affected,” a mobile showroom owner said.
