AHMEDABAD: Four persons, including two who were acquitted by the   last week in the 2002 Ahmedabad tiffin blasts case, were released from Sabarmati Central Jail on Wednesday after remaining in prison for nearly 14 years.

 These persons -Hanif Shaikh (50);   (38);   (45); and Habib Hawa (43) -were con victed by a special POTA court in the case. They were accused of planting as tiffin the five bombs that were found on May 29, 2002 in public transport buses run by   (AMTS).Three of these bombs had exploded injuring 13 people. The blasts were seen as retaliation for the 2002 communal riots.
 
 In 2006, the POTA court sentenced them to10 years jail. Later, in 2011, the Gujarat high court extended their jail term to life imprisonment.
 
 On February 2 this year, the Supreme Court acquitted Hawa and Shaikh and also ended the punishment of the other two accused, Machiswala and Kareemi. The apex court ordered their release after treating the 13 years they had spent in jail as punishment already undergone.
 
 Relatives of the four persons said that the latter had lost their valuable years behind bars and some had even lost family members when they were in prison.
 
 Talking to journalists after their release, Shaikh said that he always had faith in the judiciary. “We finally got justice from the Supreme Court,“ he said.
 
 Shaikh had a business in carry-bags when the crime branch officials arrested him in the case. It took 14 years for his innocence to be proved.
