 is essentially a love story in which good conquers the evil and the performers of   presented four breathtaking shows in a city auditorium recently. From the synchronisation to the choreography to costumes and music — everything was spectacular. The ballet was divided into four acts and each act started with an introduction. There were several characters — Prince Siegfried, evil sorcerer Von Rothbart, White and Black Swan and others. Each of the performers presented solo and 
group ballets. 
 
  
 It was the troupe’s first-ever performance in the City of Joy. After the first show,  , ballet director, told us, “We took help to understand the city and the demography of the audience. We felt that viewers here understand the nuances of the performance and have keen interest in such kind of artistic productions. With this enthusiasm we would love to come back to Kolkata to perform again.” Several dignitaries of the city were seen at the do. Our lensman spotted singer Lopamudra Mitra and musician Joy Sarkar enjoying the first show. We also spotted Anil Mukerji, CEO and managing member, Tolly Club. Speaking about the performance, he said, “It is terrific. Here, the performers are so beautifully synchronising without any evident effort. It is breathtaking.” 
  
  
 Out of the four acts in the ballet performance, the third act perhaps was the most gorgeous. In this act, the guests arrive at queen’s palace for the royal ball. The prince seeks his love, while evil sorcerer Von Rothbart introduces Odile — the black swan — to the court. Prince mistakes Odile for Odette — his love — and promises to marry her. The act showcases colourful costumes and breathtaking choreography. “This is brilliant. I’ve never seen anything like this. The drama along with the crescendo in this act is something I’ll remember for long,” said Sudeshna Banerjee, a member of the audience.
