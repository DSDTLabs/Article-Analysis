NAGPUR: It seems that defeat in the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections took time to sink in for some contestants.

 Unable to come to terms with the negative outcome, some candidates from across the political spectrum have decided to move the high court alleging serious malpractices in the polls, two days after the election results were declared.
 
 Congress candidates Suresh Jagyasi, Padma Uikey, Raman Thaokar, Aslam Khan (Muslim League), Kishore Dorle, Ramesh Ingle, Arun Dawre (all Independent), Alka Dalal, Suresh Talvekar (both  ), BSP’s   are among 30 candidates who lost the elections and have decided to register their protest. They also alleged that the EVMs were doctored in many wards to benefit the winning candidate.
 
 An all-party meeting barring BJP will be convened on February 28 and they will approach the court subsequently.
 
 Aslam Khan said the margins were not too huge to believe that it was a fair process. He lost to   by just 212 votes. He got 7,455 votes as against Ibrahim’s 7,667. “I worked in my ward at the grassroots level in the last five years. Areas in North Nagpur have been Congress strongholds since many years. When I saw that even in those areas I had very big leads, I realized there was a problem,” he said.
 
 Another defeated Congress candidate and former corporator Suresh Jagyasi suspect tempering of EVMs. Jagyasi said, “In the first round of vote counting, I was leading but later in areas where Congress had a good hold, my vote share dwindled.”
 
 “The confidence with which the BJP had been boasting of the number of seats it would win and that the Congress would be wiped out was not coincidental. Nobody can predict so accuratelyis. One can be sure of the results in advance only when he/she up to some mischief,” he said.
 
 Pranoti Dhawad, wife of former Congress corporator Prashant Dhawad who lost, has demanded re-election.
