PATNA: State urban development and housing minister   would meet Union urban development minister   on Friday to discuss the contours of   project. Hazari is also likely to seek Centre’s in-principle approval to begin work on the much-awaited project.

 Hazari told TOI on Thursday that the quick assessment study (QAS) for feasibility of operating metro rail in Patna had already been submitted to the Centre. “I would request the Union government to give us in-principle approval to start the work,” Hazari added.
 
 UDHD special secretary Sanjay Dayal said the QAS report had been completed mid-December and sent to the Centre last week. The state urban development and housing department had submitted QAS report to the Centre in place of comprehensive mobility plan (CMP). The   includes study of entire city transport and could be used for introduction of any mode of transport, such as metro, mono rail, tram and so on. “While it took three months to complete quick assessment study, CMP will take at least one year to take final shape,” the minister added. 
 
 “Since allotment of funds would take time, the state will urge the Centre to give it at least in-principle approval to the   so that the process of applying for external loan and forming special purpose vehicle could be started,” said an officer, adding that it would take at least three months to get the loan approved.
 
 Chief minister Nitish Kumar had given in-principle approval to the detailed project report of   in December 2015. The project then got state cabinet’s nod in February last year.
