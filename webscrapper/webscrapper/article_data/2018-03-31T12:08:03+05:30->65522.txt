VADODARA: There seem to be no takers for shops that the   ( ) wants to give on lease in   after the term of the present lease got over on Saturday. 

 The civic body is now looking to extend the lease of the existing tenants till further arrangements.
 
 The VMC had come up with an advertisement to auction 20 shops in the night food market near the   that remains open till the early hours. The outlets that were to be leased out included 15 small shops and five large shops.
 
 The civic body had recently advertised its intention of auctioning these 20 shops along with five others that were lying vacant. But the civic body got only 15 applications for the auction. This clearly indicated that there would be little competition for the auction and the civic body would not fetch good lease amounts.
 
 What was more surprising was the fact that the 15 applicants included only one from the 20 outlets whose leases were ending on Saturday. Clearly, the existing vendors were not interested in an auction. Quite on the contrary, they had approached the civic body seeking an extension in their leases. They had argued that the food outlets were their only means of business and they would be out of work if their leases were not renewed.
 
 The VMC is now looking to extend the leases of the tenants of the 20 outlets temporarily. It will be implementing a hike in the lease as per prevailing systems. In the meantime, it will come up with another advertisement for auctioning the shops on lease.
