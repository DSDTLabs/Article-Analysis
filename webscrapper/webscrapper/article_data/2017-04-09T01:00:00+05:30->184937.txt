You want to spend quality time with your better half and he’s more involved more on his   or   than you. Does this sound familiar? If you’re feeling hapless and frustrated there’s a name for it: you're a ‘cyber widow’. And the trend is increasingly robbing people of valuable time. If you don’t take stock of this situation soon, you may see your   on a downside. Here’s how to tiptoe your way around it, successfully...

 
 It may seem like the gadget is competing over you, but calm down. Clearly, your   may have to check work mails or messages and can’t help himself, so don’t react with anger. 
 
 
 He’s not that into you at the moment and probably answering the boss, so lift the already prevailing tension by being nice. Throw around a few jokes or light banter, which may help him relax.
 
 
 Now, it may be that he does this just once in a while but if he’s always ‘away’, when he’s with you, it’s unchivalrous. Explain that you can’t just sit by and watch it happen. 
 
 
 Try not to take work home. If you have to, keep a limited time where you have to be online. Healthy, face-to-face   and attention are both important in any relationship. Don’t make your spouse or partner feel deprived of this.
