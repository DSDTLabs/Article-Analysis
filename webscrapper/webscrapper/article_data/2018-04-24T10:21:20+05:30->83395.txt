KOCHI: A study conducted by   (IMA) Kochi branch in association with   (AOI), says that sound pollution is severe in Kochi. 

 The study conducted prior to the 'No Horn Day' on Thursday on nine important roads in Kochi shows that the sound intensity here is up to 105 decibels and constant exposure can lead to complete hearing loss.
 
 Apart from this, a hearing analysis was conducted among the bus employees at Kaloor bus stand. It was found that 60% of the drivers and 40-45% of other bus employees are having hearing problems due to constant exposure to honking. The problem is worst among drivers who work more than 14 hours a day. "Hearing loss could also be controlled by reducing usage of headphones and cell phone," said Dr Jyothi O Kumari, who was part of the study team.
 
 Dr V D Pradeep Kumar, 'No Horn Day' programme convener, said that the results indicate the health concerns of the people in Kochi. The maximum sound allowed in a commercial area is 65 decibels. Dr M Narayanan, co-convener, said that the public should grow a culture of avoiding honking as far as possible.
 
 It is as part of road safety week being observed during April 23- 30 that No-horn Day is organized. "Responding to IMA's call, the state government has already announced 'No horn day' on April 26 across the state. The high-decibel sound is not only harmful to ears but also aggravates lifestyle diseases," said Dr John Panicker, national convener, National Initiative for Safe Horn, a project by IMA. TNN
