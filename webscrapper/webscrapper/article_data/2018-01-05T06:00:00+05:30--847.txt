Who’ll play YSR on screen? Will it be  ? Or will the role go to   superstar  ? These are just some of the many speculations surrounding the much-touted biopic on the late Chief Minister of united  , Dr YS  . 

 Director   is non-committal. “It is premature to be speaking about the cast and crew at this point. we don’t even have a fixed timeline either for the project. Yes, the biopic on YSR is very much on, but we are still in the process of finalising the script. Our first priority as of now is completing the script. We’ll take a call on other details only after that,” says the filmmaker, whose last outing was Taapsee Pannu-starrer Anando Brahma. 
 
 The biopic, titled Yatra, will focus especially on the period from 1999-2004 when YS Rajasekhara Reddy undertook his famous ‘Paadayatra’, that catapulted Congress to power in 2004 and brought the various warring factions within the party together, to rally behind him. “In 2003, YSR had undertaken a three-month-long paadayaatra, where he walked 1475 kms braving the scorching summer heat, across several districts in Andhra Pradesh to lead his party to power. We want to showcase the various challenges that YSR faced during this period, including a financial crisis of sorts and how he emerged winner,” says the filmmaker. 
 
 Meanwhile, sources say Nagarjuna is keen to see the complete script of the film to gauge whether he will be able to do justice to the role of the larger-than-life mass leader.
