SURAT: The   (SBI) officials on Thursday claimed to have adequate funds in their bank chests to distribute among the account holders and cooperative banks in the city. However, a few cooperative banks complained that they were not receiving any funds from   (RBI) through the SBI, which is the lead bank for them in the city, for the past three days. 

 “We have been managing banking operations with the funds that are being deposited in our branches by our depositors. Our 29 bank branches on Wednesday received deposits totalling Rs9 crore which came in handy to us. This is why we are forced to give a savings bank account holder only Rs6,000 and a current account holder Rs10,000 in a day,” an officer of Surat People’s Cooperative Bank said.
 
 Meanwhile,   (CBI) sleuths interrogated five Surat People’s Cooperative Bank officials in Ahmedabad on Thursday in connection with the RTGS transaction relating to Rs65 crore post-demonetization. They will be interrogated on Friday again. Income-Tax survey is also going on in some banks in the city. However, many banks were able to distribute up to Rs24,000 per account to their customers on Thursday even as ATMs at many places remained non-functional in the city.
