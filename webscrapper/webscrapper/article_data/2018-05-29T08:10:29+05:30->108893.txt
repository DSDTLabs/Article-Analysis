ALAPPUZHA: While the bypoll was underway at Chengannur on Monday, most people in the constituency were not able to surf TV channels or the internet due to widespread disruption in connections. It was reportedly after the news channels started airing   ‘honour killing’ incident that the connections went haywire.   and   workers alleged that   men deliberately disrupted the connections as the latter feared that the Kottayam incident might adversely affect   vote share in the byelection.

 
 Since early morning all major channels were focussing on the election, covering the polling booths. By 10am, the channels broke the news of Kevin P Joseph’s murder and many reports said that DYFI workers were allegedly behind the murder. Several channels also pointed out the lapse on the part of police in tracing Joseph after a missing complaint was filed.
 
 Before long, cable TV operators in Chengannur started getting calls from their customers complaining of disruption in connection. The operators found out that cables were damaged by unidentified people in many parts, including Bethel Junction, Pandanad, Mundankav, Mulakkuzha and other places in the constituency. Also, the optical fibre cable of a service provider was also found cut at two places.
 
 Jomol Varghese, a homemaker, said cable TV operators had informed that there was no technical error but the cables were found damaged. She added that the connection was not restored till 7pm. However, the cable operators fear that they would land in trouble if they lodge a plaint.
 
 Meanwhile, LDF social media convener Erfan Ebrahim Sait said that the cables could be damaged due to rain and wind. “There was heavy downpour in Chengannur. BJP and UDF workers are levelling allegations against LDF for mere political gains,’’ he said.
