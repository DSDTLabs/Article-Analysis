TV actress  , who has been winning hearts with her fashion sense and is mostly seen turning up the heat in western outfits, opted for a traditional look this time around.

 
 The former   11 contestant looks simply gorgeous in a red and golden Kanjivaram saree which she wore at the Dubai fashion league. She has posted a series of pictures on Instagram.
 
 Hina looks stunning in a red silk sari along with the traditional polki jewellery. We love that she has tied her hair in a bun and adorned it with gajra, giving her the quintessential new-bride look. While Hina's recent appearances have mostly been in western outfits, this look is a refreshing change.
 
  
  
  
  
 The Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai actress is currently holidaying with her boyfriend Rocky Jaiswal in Dubai. She was recently seen enjoying Dubai safari with him.
  
  
 Hina has turned a new leaf after quitting her long -running show Yeh Rishta... she played the role of Akshara for 8 years before calling it off. During the break, she not only worked on her body and lost oodles of weight, but her fashion sense also has also evolved.
