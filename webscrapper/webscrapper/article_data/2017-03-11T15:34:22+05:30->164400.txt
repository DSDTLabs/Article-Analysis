NEW DELHI: After encountering heavy losses in the states of   and  ,   leader   said there's an urgent need for 'ideological and strategic change' in the party if its hopes to make a comeback in the future.

 "In Congress it can't be business as usual... We have to seriously decide if we are going to do the ideological and strategic change that is required," Dikshit told TOI on Saturday, adding that the poll results were not a reflection on the efficacy of any party leader.
 
 Talking about the message which a political party espouses to connect with the public, Dikshit conceded that in recent years the Congress had lost this important thread, while the BJP had used it effectively.
 
 "There're some core principles around which Congress was built and it always succeeds when we talk about that. Much of it was projected in 2004. But in 2009-14, we got confused in the image we were giving," he said.
 
 
 
 
 The former   member added that the party should consider campaigning for elections a work in progress and gear up for it in advance.
 
 "We need to get out of this sense of ennui that we start working only two-three months before elections. Political work, especially when you're in the opposition, is all five years," Dikshit said.
 
 Batting for more inclusiveness in the party rank and file, Dikshit said the Congress will be in trouble if it didn't attach itself to people and communities from different livelihoods and identities.
