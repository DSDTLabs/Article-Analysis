AHMEDABAD: A special   court on Friday sent promoter of   (DPIL), Amit  , to further police custody till Monday morning, in connection with the Rs 2,654-crore alleged bank fraud case. He was produced before the court after nine days in CBI custody. 

 The probe agency did not seek further custody of Bhatnagar's father Suresh or his younger brother   and the court sent them to judicial custody. Suresh Bhatnagar filed bail applications - for regular bail and for temporary release on health grounds. The court has posted hearing of these bail pleas on Monday.
 
 As Suresh Bhatnagar complained about his deteriorating health, the court ordered jail authorities to take him to   for a medical check-up and treatment. His health reports have been sought by Monday.
 
 For Amit Bhatnagar, the CBI submitted that as he was looking after the flagship company, his custodial interrogation for four more days may reveal more details about the alleged fraud. Bhatnagar's advocate opposed this demand by submitting that during the last nine days, the CBI interrogated him on three days only.
