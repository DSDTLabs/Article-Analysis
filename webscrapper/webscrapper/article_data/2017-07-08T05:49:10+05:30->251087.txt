JAIPUR: Even before implementing the recommendations of  ,   is gearing up to cut down salaries of   that were revised from July 2013. 

 Terming the increase as erroneous, a proposal will soon be placed before the cabinet to roll back the augmented salaries of   employees. If accepted, it will affect nearly 2 lakh employees of the state government with each of them losing about Rs 5,000 from their salaries. 
 
 The bone of contention is orders issued by the finance department on recommendations made by Krishna Bhatnagar committee constituted to remove pay anomalies. The then officials, based on their interpretation, increased the grade pay of the employees and accordingly changed their basic pay.
 
 As per the devised matrix, for employees who were moved from Rs 1,900 pay band to Rs 2,400 their corresponding basic pay was fixed at Rs 9,840. While for those who were moved from Rs 2,400 to Rs 2,800 pay band their basic pay was Rs 11,170.
 
 The state government argued that the committee had recommended changes only in the grade pay and not in basic pay. It claimed that because of erroneous interpretation, senior employees are getting lower salaries than the employees entering service after them.
 
 The government has noted that Schedule V of Rajasthan Civil Service (revised pay) Rules, 2008, may be amended accordingly so that no benefit is accrued from July 2017. However, payment made prior to that pursuant to the erroneous notification dated June 28, 2013, will not be recovered. 
 
 According to the employee association, the order will impact 2 lakh employees including LDC, UDC, constables, patwari, and gram seveak, among others. 
 
 “We have submitted our memorandum and met additional chief secretary, D B Gupta, to look into the matter. He has assured that whenever the agenda will come up for discussion in the cabinet, he will put forth their demands to the CM,” said Shivji Ram Jat, president, Rajasthan secretariat employee union.
