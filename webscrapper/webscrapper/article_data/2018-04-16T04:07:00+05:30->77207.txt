Ahmedabad: Voice of Specially Abled Persons (SAP), a global organization of volunteers, organized an event to felicitate its young volunteers from college campuses in Ahmedabad, on April 10 at Nirma University. 

 Pranav Desai, the US-based founder and mentor of Voice of SAP, said that it was heartening to see the students discussing issues related to disabilities and the problems faced by persons with disabilities (PwDs) as they volunteered for the not-for-profit organization. Volunteers of the Voice of SAP said that they understood the concept of individual social responsibility (ISR) and explained how small initiatives can bring the desired change for making society more inclusive.
 
 The organization has volunteers on different college campuses across the city. An app developed by the team also connects the users to organizations and volunteers in other countries, including the US and the UK.
