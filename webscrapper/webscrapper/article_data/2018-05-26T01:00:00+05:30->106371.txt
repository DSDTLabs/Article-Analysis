 is one of the most fitness-conscious celebs. The actor, whose   selfies give everyone major workout goals, shares his   mantra.

 
 
 The awareness about fitness is growing. In the beginning, it was just about trying to look bulky, but in the last few years, I’ve realized that fitness is really about being able to do different things. Your body needs to be functional, whether it’s  , strength, endurance or playing a sport. It’s not about doing a routine, it’s about challenging yourself and doing new things. 
 
 
 
 Being a man is not just about going to the gym and lifting heavy weights, it’s about being strong and resilient, learning to deal with all aspects of life. I love that Reebok is showcasing two different parts of my personality – who I am at home as a father, as a husband, and how I am in the gym, where I’m just a boy hitting the weights and doing what I love.
 
 
 
 Fitness is a lifestyle, it’s a state of mind, a commitment. It’s not something you do as a fad. You do it because somewhere deep inside, you feel the need to do it. That is why Reebok’s philosophy of social, mental and physical fitness resonates with me.
 
 
 Today, the biggest problem is that kids are stuck to their gadgets and the TV. So, it’s very important for parents to take children outside. Take them to gardens and parks where they can jump, climb, roll and discover themselves, and maybe with them, you discover yourself too. As Reebok says, ‘Our gym is everywhere.’
