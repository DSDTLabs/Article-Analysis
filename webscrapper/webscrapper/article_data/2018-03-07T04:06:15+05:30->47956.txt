MUMBAI: On the alert after a spate of attacks on commuters by  , the   on Monday came to the rescue of a 33-year-old man after co-passengers bashed him up. 

 Recounting the incident,  , an assistant manager with a private firm, said he makes the daily commute from   to his Mumbai Central office. On Monday, he left for work early. “I boarded the 7.40am Churchgate-bound local and entered the middle first-class compartment. All the seats were taken but there was standing space between two rows of seats. There was a group of around 10 commuters and I asked them to let me move into the space between the seats. One of them told me this doesn’t work in first-class coaches as everyone wants to sit comfortably,” said Meher.
 
 At  , some of the commuters who got in were known to the group and they were promptly accommodated in the same space. Meher says when he took objection to this, they began raining abuses on him and started punching him. “When they hit me on the nose, blood trickled onto my shirt,” said Meher. Realising he couldn’t take them on alone, he dialled ‘182’.
 
 The helpline assured Meher they would dispatch RPF personnel at Borivali. However, since the coach was packed, the RPF personnel managed to board the coach only at Andheri. The two accused, Sanjeev Mare and Anand Kumar Prasad, were taken into custody and produced before a railway court. An FIR of assault and intimidation has been filed and the case has been transferred to Vasai GRP. —Nitasha Natu
