BENGALURU: In yet another move to make   pedestrian-friendly, traffic cops on Wednesday banned parking on the 715m stretch.

 CM  , while inaugurating the renovated road, had directed officials to make the stretch   so that pedestrians can walk freely on its footpaths.
 
 On Tuesday, TOI reported how cops were placing barricades on parking bays along the street and installing ‘no parking’ boards.
 
 However, the ban caused some confusion. “The authorities should have thought about it before the inauguration. What’s the point of creating parking bays?” asked   N, a shopper.
 
 R Hithendra, additional commissioner of police (traffic), said: “We’re also planning to ban entry of vehicles for a few hours in the evening.”
