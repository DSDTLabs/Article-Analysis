SECUNDERABAD : Defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s assurance to reconsider the decision on reopening of roads in cantonments was welcomed by defence authorities here.

 
  personnel and their wives have reportedly expressed strong resentment over the reopening of the roads as it would affect the security of the families living there. Wives of Army personnel have launched a country-wide signature campaign against the decision to reopen roads.
 
  
  
 “Cantonment areas not only house Army institutions but comprise residential quarters too. Army personnel are away from homes for most of the year. Their families have expressed concerns over security. The decision to open all roads will affect the morale of the troops. The defence minister herself a woman may reconsider the blanket orders in the larger interests of the families of service personnel,” Madhavi Lata, wife of Maj Shiv Kiran, Secunderabad, told TOI.
 
 Presenting the other side of the argument, Pankaj Seth, a resident of Yapral, said, “The closed roads in Cantonments are thoroughfares developed with public funds. These roads have been continuously used for commuting by generations of locals. The   cannot block these roads without considering users. The Cantonments Act acknowledges public right of way on roads as do all municipal laws.”
 
 All India Cantonments’ Residential Welfare Associations (Cannt-India) chairman ML Agarwala and resident of Bowenpally, said closure of roads does not solve security issues. Roads are open in front of even most sensitive establishments. The V-P of   Residential Welfare Association and resident of Bollarum, J Surana, said, “lakhs will be denied their Constitutional right to freedom of movement, if the roads are closed. Cooperation solves issues.”
