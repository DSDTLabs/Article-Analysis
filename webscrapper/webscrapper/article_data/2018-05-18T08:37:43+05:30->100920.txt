MANGALURU: Scientists and researchers of   and ATREE (  in Ecology and the Environment), Bengaluru, have discovered a new species of frog belonging to the genus Microhyla. This new species was discovered in the temporary wetlands of Baikampady industrial area in Mangaluru. 

 The research team has named the tailless amphibian species after the city of Mangaluru, as   (Mangaluru narrow-mouthed frog; Kodial is Mangaluru in  ). 
 
 It was named as such to address the habitat it is found in, and to popularize the city, and its diverse unique flora and fauna. 
 
 According to researchers, the species is genetically closer to the species of Microhyla from Southeast Asia, hence the research team hypothesizes that this species could have been unintentionally introduced from Southeast Asia in the past decades, as the locality in which the new species was found, was a dumping yard for logs imported from Southeast Asia. However, researchers are not absolutely sure about how it got here, which still remains a research question to be answered in the future.
 
 The researchers who discovered the new species included Vineeth Kumar (Inspire Fellow), Radhakrishna Upadhyaya (former MSc student) and Rajashekhar K Patil, professor from Mangalore University, along with scientist   and research student Anwesha Saha from ATREE, Bengaluru, and Godwin R D, former staff, St Aloysius Pre University College, Mangaluru, who have published their findings in Zootaxa (a peer reviewed international journal) on May 16, 2018.
 
 Around two years ago, a team of researchers, comprising scientists, had discovered a new species of frog in Manipal and Mangaluru. This tiny frog measured 1.7 cm, and was called 'Laterite narrow-mouthed frog'. 
 
 It was a team of researchers comprising scientists from Gubbi Labs, ATREE, and the National University of Singapore.
