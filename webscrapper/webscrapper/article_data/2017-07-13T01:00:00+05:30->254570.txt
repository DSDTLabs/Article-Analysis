Around 18 years ago,   had roped in   to compose the soundtrack for his directorial debut, ' ', starring  , Manisha Koirala, Saif Ali Khan and Sonali Bendre. 
The love ballad, 'Tere Bin Nahin Lagda', picturised on Ajay and Manisha, remains memorable even after all these years. And now, for his upcoming action thriller ' ', the filmmaker has got Tanishk Bagchi to recreate the late legend’s creation, 'Rashk-e-Qamar'. Like 'Tere Bin Nahin Lagda', this one also features Ajay, but with Ileana D’Cruz. 
 Said to be one of Nusrat’s timeless classics, 'Rashk-e-Qamar' is an alluring number that is popular even internationally. The new version, penned by Manoj Muntashir and rendered by Rahat Fateh Ali Khan — it retains Nusrat’s voice for the original lines — releases tomorrow. Shot in the picturesque locales of Bikaner, Jodhpur and Jaisalmer in Rajasthan, the song showcases the strong relationship between Ajay and Ileana’s characters. 
 Milan says that he was trying to find the right flavour for the film, “specifically for Ajay” and was browsing through Nusrat’s songs. “Bhushan Kumar (who is also producing the film) sensed my interest in those tracks and said that he could get 'Rashk-e-Qamar'; it happened very organically,” the filmmaker recalls. 
 He adds, “The song brought back memories of 'Kachche Dhaage', which people tell me was Nusrat’s best film album. I have a deep connect with him and it’s great to have him return into my life in this way.”
