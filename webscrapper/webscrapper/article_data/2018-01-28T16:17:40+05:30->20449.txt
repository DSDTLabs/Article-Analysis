Eminem, who has repeatedly criticised  , has no regrets if he loses half his fan base.

  
  
 
 "I know that   [Clinton] had her flaws, but you know what? Anything would have been better. A f***ing turd would have been better as a president," the   said.
 
 "At the end of the day, if I did lose half my fan base, then so be it, because I feel like I stood up for what was right and I'm on the right side of this," he said.
 
 "I don't see how somebody could be middle class, busting their a** every single day, paycheck to paycheck, who thinks that that f***ing   is gonna help you."
 
 This isn't the first time the 45-year-old has spoken up about Trump. He lashed out at the president in a fiery freestyle rap,  , that debuted during a   Awards in October and called him out in an interview with media in December.
