VADODARA: Facing criticism and brickbats after its dismal performance in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) report where its name does not figure even in the list of top 200 universities of the country,   officials have decided to convene a requisite senate meeting on June 23. 

 The demand for convening a requisite senate meet was first moved by members of the ‘sankalan samiti’ immediately after the annual senate meeting got over last month for discussing the rustication row at the Institute of Leadership and Governance and establishment for   and Entrepreneurship. 
 
 The recent demand to convene the requisite senate meet cropped up after Gujarat’s only English medium university found no mention in NIRF ranking even as nine other universities from Gujarat made it in the top 200 list in the overall rankings and 12 others made it to the top 200 list in the universities rankings.
 
 On Friday, however, when members of the ‘sankalan samiti’ which comprises of representatives of the  , the RSS, the ABVP and the MSVSS, the teachers’ body, went to meet MSU vice-chancellor (VC) professor  , the meeting witnessed much bickering. 
 
 The ‘sankalan samiti’ members felt that Vyas continuously kept ignoring their presence during the meeting. 
 
 A senate member from the ‘samiti’, Hasmukh Vaghela even said that Vyas was more busy watching news channels which were airing the news of Bollywood star Salman Khan who has been jailed for killing two blackbucks.
 
 “It seemed as if he was more interested in the Bollywood superstar’s conviction than the falling academic standards of the university,” said Vaghela. 
 
 Vaghela’s remarks, however, rattled Vyas, who insisted that any discussion related to NIRF rankings will happen only during the forthcoming senate meet. 
 
 “While we kept on insisting that we are ready to support any scheme or plan that the university has to improve academic standards so that we can improve upon NIRF rankings in future, the VC kept ignoring our talks,” said another member of the samiti.
