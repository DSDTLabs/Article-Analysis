After becoming a sought-after music director following the release of his songs from Enai Noki Paayum Thota,   is now all set to begin his next journey — as a director. The composer will be directing a film which will be produced by   of   fame. 

 Talking about this move to directing, Darbuka Siva says, “I’m approaching direction just like how I approach independent music. It’s an exciting process. I just take things as they come. I never planned to become a musician. I played music because I enjoyed playing music. I never planned to become a music director, either. It just happened. So, in my present state of mind, I feel that direction is something I would enjoy doing.”
 
 He says that he has working experience because he has worked extensively with people who make movies. He also adds that he will simultaneously continue to compose music for other films. 
 
 He is cagey when we ask him details about the film, and says, “It’s too early to talk about the film. We have only announced the casting call now.” But he informs that he has written the script of the film as well. “I had this idea in my head and started writing it down. I didn’t even write it as a movie script as such. It was only later that I turned it into a proper film script. It was a very organic process,” he describes the writing experience. 
 
 Sameer says that the film is most likely to go on floors by August. “Things have to settle down in the industry following the strike, in terms of artistes’ dates, and all that. Luckily for us, our cast will pretty much be new faces,” he says.
