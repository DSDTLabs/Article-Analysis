PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A razor sharp Chinese   caused severe injuries on the left   and face of a two-and-a-half-year-old boy as his uncle was riding him on a bike to a garden at Kalewadi on Tuesday. 

 Doctors had to apply 30-35   to treat Hamza Khan’s left eyelid. The thread had left the nasal bone and the bones near his eyes exposed. 
 
 Shivaji Bhise, who witnessed the accident, said, “On seeing the boy bleeding profusely, some passersby and I helped him and his uncle reach a private hospital nearby. Doctors there referred him to another private hospital in Pimple Saudagar.” However, as both the hospitals did not have eye surgeons to take care of the boy, he was again referred to a private hospital in Thergaon.
 
 Pramod Borghare, an ENT specialist at the Thergaon hospital, said, “The boy was profusely bleeding when he was brought around 8.30pm. We took the opinion of an ophthalmologist to determine the course of treatment . Fortunately, there was no eye-ball injury. We started a surgery on him around 1230am and the process continued for over 45 minutes.” He added, “Hamza’s haemoglobin levels had dropped to 6 because of alarming blood loss.A blood loss of 200-300ml is also major for a child of his age. He is now stable. We will again take the opinion of an eye specialist.”
 
 Hamza’s father, Mohammad Riyaz Khan, said, “We have been living in a rented house in Kalewadi after coming from New Delhi eight months ago. I work here as an electrician. Hamza was on the bike with my cousin when the accident occurred.” Though Khan was oblivious of the ban on the thread, he said authorities should take action to stop use of the thread and prevent such accidents.
