AGRA: UP cabinet minister Suresh   has landed in a controversy after he ate food ordered from an eatery instead of the meal prepared at the house of a   family in   on Monday night. 

 
 The visit was in line with BJP’s “outreach programme” for the community. Rana along with several other   leaders landed up at the residence of Rajnish Kumar Singh, a Dalit, in Lohagadh, Aligarh district on Monday. “I was not aware of the minister’s visit. Everything appeared preplanned. I was asked to sit in the house. Dinner was brought from outside along with bottles of mineral water. It was just a formality or a photo-op for the minister to be at a Dalit’s house,” Singh told TOI. 
 
 Some of the food items arranged for Rana, who was supposed to dine at the Dalit household, included dal makhni, mattar paneer, pulao, tandoori roti and gulab jamun for dessert. Asked about his choice of food at the Dalit household, Rana flatly refused the allegation against him and said that they ordered food from a local sweetshop as there were nearly 100 people accompanying him. 
 
 “I had dinner in their drawing room and also ate food prepared by the family. They were well aware about my visit,” he said. Under its “Gram Swaraj Abhiyan”, which was launched earlier this month, the BJP has asked its MPs, including state and Union ministers, to spend at least one night in a village where SCs/STs constitute over 50% of the population. 
 
 The party leaders have been instructed to ensure that everyone in such villages is covered under government schemes of LPG connections, free vaccination for children and Jan Dhan accounts. The campaign is being seen as part of BJP’s plan to reach out to the rural poor, especially the lower castes, before it faces a string of assembly elections finally leading to the Lok Sabha polls in 2019.
