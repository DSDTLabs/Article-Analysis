BENGALURU: Do not treat dogs like dogs, treat them like humans! This is precisely what the government-run   Corporation (KSRTC) is reiterating in its new luggage policy released last week.

 The utility has directed its crew to consider a pet dog as an   and allow it to travel by bus by collecting regular fare.
  
  
 
 “We had been receiving complaints from passengers that our crew refuse to allow pets on buses. We wanted to change it and make our staff and services petfriendly. So, we decided to collect fare on par with passengers for pets travelling by our buses,” a   said.
 
 KSRTC, which is headquartered in Bengaluru, has a fleet of around 8,000 buses that ply to different parts of the state and also neighbouring states.
 
 The copy of the luggage-related circular accessed by TOI states that passengers will not be allowed to get their   on board, if they refuse to pay the full fare.
