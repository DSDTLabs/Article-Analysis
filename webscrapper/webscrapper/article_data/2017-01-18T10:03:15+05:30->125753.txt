LUCKNOW: All claims to the Samajwadi Party and its symbol by   and Amar Singh were dismissed by the   in its 42-page order. The EC expressed concern over how Mulayam never called any national convention despite repeated demands by members of the party who had elected him national president. The commission’s observations are a scathing attack on Mulayam for running a political party in an undemocratic manner.

 In the wake of sudden turn of events, the manner in which the party patriarch along with his younger brother Shivpal Yadav challenged   has not only empowered him, it has Mulayam relegated to third position after   while Shivpal finds no place in the hierarchy in the changed dynamics in the family and the party.
 
 What went in Akhilesh’s favour is the strength of numbers as he had already marshaled support everywhere in the legislature party, rank and file and among grsssroot workers and had challenged the rival faction in the Election Commission to claim the party from the old guards. The EC decision is just an official declaration of whatever Akhilesh had been claiming as he drew support all the way from his official residence to the   convention.
 
 In view of a decisive blow by Akhilesh who was backed by his supporters and then by the Election Commission, the rival camp is in no mood to face further humiliation in the party or public and has started toeing him by recommending certain names for his list for the assembly elections even as first day of nominations went without any papers being filed by the Samajwadi Party.
