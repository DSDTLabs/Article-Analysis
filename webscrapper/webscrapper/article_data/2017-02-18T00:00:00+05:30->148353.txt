 has just signed up for a new film in Kannada. Called  , the film is the launchpad for newbie Vidyabharan, who hails from a politico family. 

 “There are five heroines in the film, all of who are equally important to the story and the hero’s character development. Each of us has our own journey, and we appear in different phases of the hero’s life, and leave him with great experiences. In fact, the whole film is about his life experiences. My character, an ultra-glam girl, comes at a time that is crucial to the plot and plays a strong foundation towards the climax. While the film was officially launched earlier this week, I will join the set a little later, as I need to finish the final schedule of my upcoming film, Dandupalya 2, before that. Chocolate Boy is directed by Muthukumar, and I will be shooting across locations in Bengaluru,   and Bangkok,” she says.
