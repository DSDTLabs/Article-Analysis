COIMBATORE: All India Anna   would suffer a severe drubbing in the coming local body elections because of   general secretary V K Sasikala’s backdoor attempts to become chief minister, said former TNCC president  .

 Speaking to reporters in Pollachi on Monday, Elangovan said only those with party postings in AIADMK are backing Sasikala’s elevation to chief minister’s post. 
 
 “The people of Tamil Nadu do not like   crowning herself as chief minister. Not just people, even those in AIADMK, who hold no posts, are not accepting her elevation,’’ he said.
 
 Elangovan said those who were not elected by voters cannot become chief minister. Only those elected by public should hold the office of CM. 
 
 “O Panneerselvam should remain as CM. If Sasikala continues her attempt to become CM through backdoor with the help of money and muscle power, AIADMK would suffer a drubbing in the local body elections,” he said.
 
 Women in particular and all voters in general are against Sasikala across the state, whereas one could see Jayalalithaa’s niece growing in stature in villages, he said.
 
 Welcoming DMK working president M K Stalin’s statement that people voted only for Jayalalithaa and not for those working in her household, Elangovan said that the alliance between Congress and DMK would continue.
