 DEHRADUN: A spate of deaths of tourists due to drowning in Ganga at Rishikesh has been reported in a span of just 24 hours. While three youngsters, all in their early twenties, are feared drowned in Ganga around Byasi near Rishikesh on Sunday, another tourist from Delhi lost his life after he fell off from a raft on Saturday.
  
  According to senior superintendent of police (SSP) Pauri, Mukhtar Mohsin, “A group of 15 tourists, including 10 people from Delhi and five from Gujarat, was staying in a resort at Sirasu. On Sunday morning, they went to a beach to play volleyball. Four of them decided to take a dip into the river as the water appeared still. But they were swept away by the strong internal currents of Ganga.”
  
  The members of the group managed to rescue one of them but Abbas Bhabrawala (23) and Hussain (23), both residents of Dahod district in Gujarat, and   (25), who hailed from Delhi, were swept away.
  
  The divers of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) reached the spot and launched an operation to find the three tourists. “We have not been able to recover their bodies. The operation will restart on Monday morning,” said the SSP.
  
  On Saturday, another tourist from Delhi, who was on a rafting adventure with his friends, drowned after the raft flipped over in Ganga in Rishikesh. The victim was identified as 34-year-old Subhash  , a resident of Mehrauli.
