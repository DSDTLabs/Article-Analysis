ALLAHABAD: Days after the son of   president   won the Gorakhpur bypoll on a   ticket, the party's   said he would not support the SP or the BSP candidate in the upcoming   elections. 

 Sanjay Nishad's son Praveen has recently won the Gorakhpur byelection, held on March 11, on a SP ticket. 
 
 Mishra said he was the general secretary of the Nishad party and yet the party chief did not have the courtesy to consult him before joining hands with SP for the bypolls.
 
 "Sanjay Nishad spoke to me a couple of days ago and asked me to vote for the SP candidate in the Rajya Sabha elections. But I clearly told him that I would neither support the SP candidate nor back the BSP candidate," said Mishra. "There is no 'dushmani' (enmity) with SP. This is a fight of ideology. I had contested the last assembly election against the SP and won it."
