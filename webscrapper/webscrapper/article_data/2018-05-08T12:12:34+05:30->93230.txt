SALEM: Father of a medical aspirant, who was turned away from an examination centre for NEET on Sunday since her admit card was found to be fake, has lodged a police complaint against an e-seva centre for issuing the wrong admit card.

 Navaratnaraj, father of Jeevitha, who was refused permission by   authorities, said in the complaint that the e– seva centre had issued the ‘fake’ admit card. 
 
 The medical aspirant, Jeevitha from Rasipuram, had one hall ticket with exam centre allotted at Kondalampatti in Salem and the other hall ticket had the centre at   in Kerala. 
 
 Jeevitha had visited the Salem exam centre where she was sent away. 
 
 NEET authorities said that the exam centre number given in the hall ticket was not that of Kondlampatti exam centre where the girl came.
 
  told police that he had approached the e-seva centre on Anna Salai in Rasipuram and registered for Neet. After the admit card was uploaded in the CBSE website, he visited the centre where the personnel managing the centre downloaded the card and gave him. 
 
 “It had Kondalampatti as the exam centre. The next day I got a call from the person in the centre stating that they have received another card which had Kottayam as the exam centre. We were confused but went to Salem centre since it was close-by,’’ he told reporters. 
 
 Now he has blamed the e- seva centre personnel for the bungling.
