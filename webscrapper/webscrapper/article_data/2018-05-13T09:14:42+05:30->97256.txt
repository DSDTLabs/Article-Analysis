KOLKATA: The Indian   ( ) administration has finally got their security guards – hired from a private agency – to shun their military uniforms. 
 had reported on April 10 how the security guards wore combat uniforms with the crossed swords emblem and   printed on the fabric, prompting many visitors to believe that they were soldiers. Some even had their trousers tucked into boots in military style as they strutted around in a non-military gait or slouched on chairs.

 
 After coming to know that the ‘soldiers’ guarding the IBG at Shibpur, Howrah, had even misbehaved with some visitors, the Army sent a team to check. The officers and jawans in plainclothes realized that the guards were masquerading as soldiers and took up the issue in earnest. IBG director M U  , when contacted by 
 , had promised to rectify this.
 
 There are sections in law that prohibit civilians from wearing uniforms of public servants. It includes a specific section for security agencies stating how the owner and his employees can be jailed if caught wearing military uniform.
 
 “This is not only a matter of prestige of the armed forces but also an issue concerning national security. Combat uniforms are protected by trademark. However,some of the fabric does get out to the civilian market as soldiers sometimes need to replace uniforms issued to them. However, the fabric is not supposed to be used by civilians, security guards or otherwise. If private security guards or common citizens strut around in such uniforms and misbehave with others, it gives the military a bad name. Such people may also pose a security threat at strategic locations. We are pleased that the garden has taken necessary steps,” a senior Army officer said.
