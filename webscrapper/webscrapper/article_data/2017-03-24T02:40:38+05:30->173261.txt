NOIDA: Gautam Budh Nagar MLA   on Thursday assured homebuyers of Noida in a meeting that he would personally visit all the under-construction   of Noida and   to get a first-hand estimate of the backlog of home deliveries in the twin cities.

 In a meeting held with the homebuyers’ body, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association ( ), on Wednesday morning, Singh assured the buyers that all pre-election promises made by Singh to the homebuyers will be met.
 
 “All cooperation has been promised to the buyers, especially with the issue of implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (RERA) in UP and setting up a pro-buyer regulator,” the office of Pankaj Singh on Akbar Road, New Delhi, said.
 
 The homebuyers of Noida had withdrawn their ‘No House No Vote’ campaign ahead of the UP election after promises by BJP national leaders that RERA would be implemented in the state after the election.
 
 The buyers requested Pankaj that they be given an opportunity to meet chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi so they could directly explain their situation to him.
 
 Nefowa president Abhishek Kumar said it has been a long wait for the buyers. “We have waited for years now and some action needs to be taken to correct the situation,” Kumar said.
 
 He said that Nefowa representatives have expressed their demand to Pankaj Singh that RERA be implemented in Uttar Pradesh with the central government’s recommendations in it and not the watered-down version notified in UP in November last year.
 
 Shweta Bharti, general secretary, Nefowa, said, “We have sought a date when we can take Singh on a personal visit to Noida Extension and surrounding areas under construction where apartments are delayed. We hope we get a date from him soon.”
 
 Last November the buyers had condemned the four exclusions made in the UP adaptation of RERA as implemented in the Union Territories.
