PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment   said that Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) seat tally would drop after the 2019 Lok Sabha (LS) elections, but Narendra Modi would become the Prime Minister again.

 Athavale expressed this opinion while addressing a press conference in Akurdi on Thursday.
 
 He elaborated saying, “Currently, BJP’s seat tally is 282. It will, however, come down to over 250 after the LS elections next year. The party might suffer minor losses in  , but, it is expected to form government in three north-eastern states whose results will be declared soon. The Patel community in Gujarat sided with the Congress during the assembly elections causing loss to BJP. Nonetheless, BJP is now winning again in local self-government elections. Narendra Modi will become the Prime Minister again in 2019.”
 
 When asked who would suffer if BJP and Shiv Sena contested separately, the Union minister said, “BJP and Shiv Sena must fight the LS elections unitedly. It would be unwise for Shiv Sena to contest separately,” adding that his loyalties would remain with the ruling government.
 
 After Sena announced to go solo in the upcoming LS election, Athawale has been making efforts to bring the two parties together. “I recently met BJP secretary Ram Lal and expressed the need to keep Sena in the alliance. I suggested that one Union cabinet minister and some state ministers be chosen from the latter,” he said.
 
 Former chief minister Narayan   is trying to get a ministerial berth in the state cabinet for a long time.   had earlier suggested that he could join the RPI (Athavale group). Reacting to the same, he said, “I have no objection to his joining my party. This merger will be in the interest of our party as Rane is an experienced leader. I will push for Rane and other big Maratha leaders to join hands with my party and create a better appeal among the voters,” Athavale further said.
