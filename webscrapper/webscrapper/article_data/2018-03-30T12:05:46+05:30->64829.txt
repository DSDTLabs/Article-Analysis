Vadodara: Burglars made an unsuccessful attempt to break into   branch of   in the wee hours of Thursday before stealing cash and ornaments worth over Rs 1 lakh from a house besides it.

 Police said that the thieves broke the lock of the bank which is on the first floor of a building, but did not enter inside. They later broke into the house of Jatin   which is right beside the building in which the bank’s branch is situated.
 
 The burglars stole Rs 10,000 cash and ornaments and other valuables worth Rs 95,000 from Patel’s house. According to police sources, Patel and his family members were in Mumbai when the incident took place.
 
 “The burglars did not seem like the   who dare to break into a bank. They would have realized that it was a bank only after breaking the lock since it is a small rural branch located on first floor of the building and that could be the reason they did not attempt to go inside,” said a police official.
