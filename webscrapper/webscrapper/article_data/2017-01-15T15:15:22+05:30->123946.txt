NEW DELHI:   (BSP) supremo   on Sunday said the   should be ready to face demonetisation's repercussions in the upcoming state elections, as the move has rendered 90 per cent of people 'kangaal' (cashless).

 "It's been over 50 days post demonetisation and yet PM Modi hasn't revealed how much black money has been recovered," she said while addressing a press conference in Lucknow.
 
 "After its achhe din (good days) promise, BJP should be prepared for burey din (bad days)," she added.
 
 Meanwhile, Mayawati also announced that her party would go it alone in the upcoming   elections and that it alone can keep the BJP out of the state.
 
 "The Congress is on oxygen support. BJP and Samajwadi Party (SP) have a tacit understanding," the BSP supremo alleged.
 
 The former CM also rubbished corruption allegations being levelled against her brother Anand Kumar. Mayawati's brother is under the I-T scanner after his assets reportedly zoomed 174 times during her tenure as the Chief Minister.
 
 "Just when the elections are near, the BJP government has found faults in the businesses run by my family members. If there were glaring irregularities, then why did they remain silent for two-and-a-half years? Their conspiracy against me will boomerang on them," said Mayawati.
 
 On her 61st birthday, Mayawati has also appealed to her party workers to keep celebrations low-key.
 
 "Unlike SP, BSP does not splurge on birthday celebrations. Keep it (her birthday celebrations) simple by doing welfare of the needy and underprivileged," she told party workers.
