NEW DELHI:  , accused of mowing down two people while driving a BMW at high speed, has been granted relief from a   on Friday, which acquitted him of the charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

 However, the court convicted him for a lesser charge of causing death by rash and negligent driving. Bhasin, son of a Haryana-based businessman had been slapped with a harsher charge of culpable homicide along with rash and negligent driving after he was involved in a hit-and-run case in south Delhi in 2008.
 
 Additional sessions judge Sanjeev Kumar convicted Bhasin under IPC Sections 304-A (causing death by rash and negligent act), 279 (driving rashly which could endanger human life) and 338 (causing grievous hurt).
 
 Even as the prosecution pressed for conviction under Section 304 IPC (culpable homicide) the court acquitted him saying there was lack of evidence to prosecute Bhasin on harsher charges.
 
 ASJ Kumar also noted that the witnesses did not support prosecution’s charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, for which a person can be jailed for a minimum 10 years or maximum for life.
 
 Under the Sections in which Bhasin has been convicted (304A and 338 of IPC), he could face maximum imprisonment for two years or a fine.
 
 According to the prosecution, Bhasin was at the wheels when he hit a two-wheeler on Moolchand flyover, killing Anuj Singh, who was riding pillion, and injuring Mrighank Srivastava on September 11, 2008.
 
 After convicting Bhasin, the court fixed May 26 to hear arguments on quantum of sentence and has also asked the police to file a report on the economic condition of the victim’s family to decide the compensation.
 
 The court has further asked the brother and the father of the victim to remain present on the next date of hearing. It also asked Srivastava to appear before the court on the next hearing on sentencing.
