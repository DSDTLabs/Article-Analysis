Pune: The main team of the Richard Branson-led Virgin   One will start the feasibility study of the proposed hyperloop route from Shivajinagar to Navi Mumbai airport and to BKC/Dadar by the end of this month.

 The team will arrive next week for the study, which is expected to be completed by April. “It will hold talks with local officials and check for the viability of the project before submitting its report to the government,” PMRDA commissioner Kiran Gitte said on Wednesday.
 
 He said the company has now placed the Pune-Mumbai route on the top of its priority list. “The feasibility study is expected to cost about Rs 12 crore,” Gitte said.
 
 PMRDA officials said the team from Virgin Hyperloop is expected to stay in Pune. “PMRDA will help the team in assessing route feasibility, geography, terrain as well as the engineering firms through six workshops,” the officials said.
 
 “The pre-feasibility study had assessed the routes. The feasibility study will check for the alignment of the route and other factors,” the officials said, adding that it will be followed by a detailed project report.
 
 The 10-km demonstration track for the proposed Pune-Mumbai hyperloop is expected to open for public scrutiny by 2021.
 
 It was during the Magnetic Maharashtra in February that the Virgin Group had signed a framework agreement with the state government to build a hyperloop transportation system between Pune and Mumbai. The system is expected to reduce the travel time between the two cities to just about 25 minutes against three hours now.
