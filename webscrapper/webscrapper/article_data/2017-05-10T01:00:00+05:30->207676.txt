 Sanon, who will be seen opposite   Rajput in ' ', admits it’s one of the best scripts that has come her way so far. “Raabta is a love story but with a twist. It has a lot to do with our dreams and destiny; it’s also about the unexplainable connection between two souls.” 

 In the course of making the film, Kriti was romantically linked to her co-actor Sushant, who had also been through heartbreak. Kriti, calling him an amazing actor, says, “Sushant is much more experienced than me. The kind of hard work he put in kept me on my toes. It also scared me because I had to also give my best. We had a lot of scenes in which our energies matched.” 
 
 She adds, “Improvisations were made on the spot. Working with a good actor lifts your scenes because sometimes, you get a reaction that you don’t expect, and that, in turn, makes your reaction better. Sometimes something real happens and it’s magical. Our Mauritius schedule was hectic but we had a blast while shooting in Budapest.”
