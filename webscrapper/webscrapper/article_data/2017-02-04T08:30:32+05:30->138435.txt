CHANDIGARH: Clearing the way for selection of 280 veterinary surgeons on contractual basis in the  , the   on Friday dismissed an appeal seeking stay on the recruitment process.

 A division bench headed by Justice Surya Kant passed these orders while dismissing an appeal filed by   of Faridabad district. He had filed an appeal before the bench after his main petition was dismissed by a single-judge bench on January 19, 2017.
 
 The petitioner had challenged the advertisement issued on December 22, 2016, by the department of animal husbandry and dairying for recruitment of 280 veterinary surgeons on contractual basis for a period of one year or till the posts are filled by candidates selected by the   (HPSC). The government wanted to fill vacancies on contract basis because of delay in regular selections.
 
 It was also informed that delay in finalizing the regular recruitment by the HPSC was due to the fact that the commission had sought advice on the syllabus for the written examination since the posts were highly technical in nature, and on the other hand in view of the acute shortage of veterinary surgeons, the large livestock economy of Haryana was being severally affected.
 
 The apprehension voiced by the petitioner was that this was a conspiracy with a larger design and once contractual appointments are made, the process for making regular appointment would lose all steam. It was also argued that the post of veterinary surgeon is a group-A post and contractual appointments can be made only for group-C and D only.
 
 Hearing the petition, single bench headed by Justice   had dismissed the petition after finding no merits into that. Aggrieved from the orders, the petitioner had filed an appeal before the division bench, which also dismissed the petition on Friday.
