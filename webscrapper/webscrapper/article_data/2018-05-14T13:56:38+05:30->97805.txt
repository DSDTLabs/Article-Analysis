VADODARA: M S University’s Faculty of Science will re-start offering Bachelors of Science (BSc) in mathematics at the M K Amin Arts and Science College and College of Commerce,   from this academic year. 

 It was last year that after a gap of several years the university had re-started science stream at the Padra college by offering admission in first year BSs in chemistry stream. While BSc in chemistry was offered to students under the higher payment category (on self-financed basis), BSc in maths will be offered to students as a regular grant-in-aid programme. 
 
 “Earlier too, we were offering BSc in mathematics at Padra college but the programme got discontinued. Now, we will be re-starting the BSc in mathematics programme with one division offering 60 to 80 seats,” said professor  , head of Department of Mathematics and vice-dean of Faculty of Science. 
 
 Principal of Padra College has already written a letter to   officials to re-start the BSc programme for which the university needs a proper refurbished classroom in terms of infrastructure. 
 
 When the university re-started the BSc chemistry programme at Padra college it did not have any sanctioned teaching post because of which it had to offer the programme on self-finance mode. In the case of mathematics, however, the university already has a teaching post sanctioned at the college. 
 
 Owing to the response that BSc programme are receiving from aspirants and university’s own policy to enhance its student strength, MSU since last couple of years is focusing on increasing its intake capacity.
