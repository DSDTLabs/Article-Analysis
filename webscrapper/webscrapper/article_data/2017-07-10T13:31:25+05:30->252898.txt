PATNA: The Rashtriya   (RJD) on Monday rejected the demand for resignation of party leader and deputy chief minister   over the CBI raids in the land-for-hotels case.

 A day ahead of the meeting of JD(U) legislators called by Bihar chief minister   to decide on the party's stand on the CBI raids, RJD legislators and senior party leaders, including MPs, declared that there was no question of Tejashwi's resignation.
 The RJD also categorically said there were no differences between Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav. The RJD said that Nitish Kumar had called Lalu Prasad on Sunday and had asked about his well-being.
 
 "There is a conspiracy to break the grand alliance, but the state government is very much in place and stable," the RJD said.
 
 On Friday, the CBI had registered a corruption case against Lalu Prasad, his wife  , son Tejashwi Yadav, former Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) Managing Director PK Goyal; and the wife of Lalu's confidante Prem Chand Gupta, Sujata on allegations of awarding the tender for development, maintenance and operation of hotels in Ranchi and Puri in 2006.
 
 The case was registered on the allegations of awarding the tender for development, maintenance and operation of Hotels at Ranchi and Puri to a Private Company dealing with Hotels in the year 2006. The investigative agency also conducted searches at 12 locations across Patna, Delhi, Gurugram and other places.
 
 The RJD supremo, however, refuted the allegations against him and called it a political conspiracy hatched by the BJP.
