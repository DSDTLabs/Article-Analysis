NEW DELHI: The   (EOW) of Delhi Police has launched a preliminary inquiry into allegations of forgery, cheating and fraud against a “relative” of chief minister   and some public servants for alleged irregularities in grant of contracts for roads and sewer lines.

 No FIR has been lodged yet and a notice has been sent to the complainant, Rahul Sharma, to appear before the unit or depute someone to provide documents pertaining to the complaint and join investigations.
 
 The complaint was lodged by Kisley Pandey, a lawyer, on behalf of NGO Roads Anti-Corruption Organisation. It accuses the proprietor of a construction firm and some PWD officials of corruption. It has been alleged that fake bills and invoices were submitted to the government and payments made. The complaint claims that no material was actually purchased for the work. It alleges a loss of around Rs 10 crore to the exchequer. 
 
 The complaint alleges that the owner of the company operated through several dummy firms to obtain government contracts "in connivance with various senior PWD officials" which never got executed.
 
  sources said whether or not the contractor was related to the CM was irrelevant since he had not been given the contract on that basis. “He bid for some work for which PWD has not even paid him. We do not understand why the CM has been dragged into this. This man is an old contractor with PWD and has executed several projects. It has been clarified that PWD has no interest in where a contractor gets material from as long as the product and the final project are of the necessary quality,” said an official.
