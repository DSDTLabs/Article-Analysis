PANAJI: The additional solicitor general of India, Atmaram  , who appeared in the   on behalf of the Goa government in the   case, said he was of the view that mining leases should be auctioned.

 “As the advocate general of the state (in 2016), I had given a clear cut written opinion that the state government should go for auction of leases. I stand by it that leases should be auctioned,” he told TOI after the Supreme Court quashed the second renewal of iron   mining leases to 88 companies in the state
 
 However, he said he would advise the government only after going through the entire 101-page order. “I have to first go through the judgment and then give my advice,” he said.
 
 “In the high court my stand was the same… to go for auction. However, the mineral policy framed by the government contemplated lease renewals,” he said.
