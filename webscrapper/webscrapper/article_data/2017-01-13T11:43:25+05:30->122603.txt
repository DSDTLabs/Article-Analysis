LUCKNOW:   will now have to ply without pressure horns. On Thursday , the transport department conducted a statewide drive and removed pressure horns from government vehicles.

 Though the department did not divulge names of the officers from whose vehicles the horns were removed, enforcement officers did not deny they had to face resentment.
 
 “We will also take action against those government vehicle drivers who are found driving without wearing the seat belt. They will get their DLs suspended for three months,“ said transport commissioner  .
 
 Sources said the matter was also brought to the notice of the chief secretary after there was resentment over the move. The department is checking vehicles for violations under the MV Act during the ongoing Road Safety Week. The drive conducted on Thursday was exclusively against government vehicles.
