Pailan (South 24 Parganas): Giving private rights to government-owned rain-fed channels on either side of roads by a section of block land officers and illegal boring of drinking-water pipelines to draw water for farming have emerged as two major proble-ms in South 24 Parganas, whi-ch is the largest vegetable exporter district in the country.

 Chief minister   Banerjee took seriously a complaint from Maheshtala Municipality chairman Dulal Das, who said at the administrative meeting on Monday that a section of block land and land revenue officers (BLLROs) in the district were giving away state-owned rain-fed wayside channels (nayanjuli) to private ryots, making it difficult to lay drinking water pipelines there. 
 
 “I would ask you to file a complaint with the anti-corr-uption cell so that the government can take such BLLROs to task,” she said. She told chief secretary Moloy De to take action against the accused when the complaint comes.
 
 Public representatives also pointed to the lack of coordination between government agencies while digging up roads for laying pipelines. 
 
 “It happens with all the agencies, whether it is PWD or public health engineering. I will ask the government agencies to restore the road after doing your work independently so that people don’t have to suffer,” the CM said. 
 
 Trinamool MLA from Uttar Sonarpur, Firdousi Begum, complained against pu-blic harassment at the block land office. “I have also come across similar complaints. We have launched a Samayer Sathi programme that specifies the time limit that a government employee needs to complete a particular work. You can lodge a complaint if he exceeds the time limit. We can take action against the laggards,” the CM said. 
 
 Banerjee didn’t entertain Trinamool leader Arabul Islam when he complained that land mutation had been stalled at Bhangar. “Your problem is different. A host of builders and promoters have created trouble in the area.”
