Actor   tied the knot with his long-time girlfriend Arpitha Sebastian in a private affair at a beachside resort in Kannur on Thursday.
According to his friends, the function was simple with only close friends and family of the couple in attendance. Dhyan’s friends tell us that the wedding didn’t have any rituals. “The bride and groom exchanged garlands and tied the thali,” says lyricist Manu Manjith.
 
 The highlight of the event was the sadya offered by the groom’s dad Sreenivasan. Director Basil Joseph says, “The rice and vegetables were organic and were cultivated in Sreenivasan sir’s farm. It was tastier than any sadya I ever had.”
 
 Elder brother   too was in the thick of the action and had also rendered a song at the occasion.
 Manu says, “Vineethettan said, ‘As the bride is a Christian and groom a Hindu, let me sing a mappila paattu to make it more secular’. And then he went on to sing the love song from Classmates, Ente Kalbile.”
 
  Dhyan’s buddies Aju Varghese and Neeraj Madhav made time for the wedding in between their shooting schedule of Lavakusa. Writer M Mukundan, directors Sathyan Anthikad, V M Vinu, Srikant Murali and actors Deepak Parambol and Santhosh Keezhatoor were also present at the wedding.
