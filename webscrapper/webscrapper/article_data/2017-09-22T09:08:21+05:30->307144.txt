HYDERABAD: Facing public wrath against the city's pockmarked and waterlogged roads, the   seems to have finally got down to the task of restoring several stretches in the city in real earnest.

 With TOI taking the lead in ridding the city of potholed roads with the Crater Hyderabad campaign, many of the civic grievances aired in these columns, including the TOI Citizen Reporter app, are now being addressed by the civic authorities.
 
 For instance on Thursday ,   authorities began restoring the waterlogged road near King   Hospital after the plight of commuters on this stretch was highlighted in the edition dated September 21. The open manhole spotted on that road on September 20 had been covered when TOI inspected the place on Thursday . While the stagnant water on the road was being cleared by GHMC workers, the publicity cell of GHMC kept TOI updated on the progress of work.
 
 Appreciating the role played by TOI and GHMC in clearing up the stagnant water,  , a flower vendor whose shop is adjacent to  , said: “I was the worst affected by the pool of sewage in front of my shop as customers were giving my shop a miss.“ The stretch near Rythu Bazaar in Mehdipatnam was spruced up by GHMC's sanitation department by clearing the garbage on the road on September 19 after the concerns of commuters were published in that day's edition.
 
 Patchwork has also been carried out at Banjara Hills Road Number 10 and near an e-Seva centre on Banjara Hills Road No.7. “We are also taking up restoration works at Jubilee Hills Road Number 10 within three days,“ said Chinna Reddy , executive engineer, Central Zone, GHMC.
 
 “There was water-logging on the stretch connecting LB Nagar Circle and Saroornagar Lake, so we have laid a CC patch instead of bitumen one. We also raised the height of the road and improved road slopes to ensure seamless flow of water into manholes,“ said K Shanker, executive engineer, LB Nagar Circle, GHMC.
