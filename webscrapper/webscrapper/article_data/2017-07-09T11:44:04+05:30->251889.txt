PATIALA: The Officers’ Enclave neighbourhood in Officers’ Colony, Patiala, is mourning the sudden demise of one of its celebrated neighbours, Wing Commander   Dhillon, who lost his life on July 4, in a helicopter crash during a flood rescue operation in Arunachal Pradesh.

 His neighbours in Patiala remember him as a warm and outgoing person with exceptional leadership qualities. He was commanding the 115 Helicopter Unit stationed at Tezpur and had over 18 years of flying experience in varied terrain, from icy mountains to the jungles of the north east. Considered to be a daredevil officer, a thorough gentleman, and a kind soul, Wing Commander Dhillon belonged to the family of defence personnel from Patiala.
 
 The last rites of his mortal remains were performed at the Tezpur Air Force base on Saturday with state honours. His father P S Dhillon, a retired  , had left for Tezpur on July 6, along with his wife, daughter and son-in-law.
 
 One of Wing Commander Dhillon’s neighbours, H S Puri, a retired engineer from the Military Engineering Service (MES), said, “We are deeply hurt and shocked by the news. It is an irreparable loss. He was to achieve great success in the IAF given his intelligence and young age. This unfortunate incident has cut the dream short.”
 
 Wing Commander Dhillon was also a long-distance runner who won almost every race he participated in. After completing his schooling from the prestigious Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC), Dehradun, he was selected for the National Defence Academy (NDA), Khadakvasla as an   cadet and joined Foxtrot Squadron.
 
 He never liked being away from the flying duties and pursed his passion with sincerity. On July 4, he had already made five sorties and had rescued 169 stranded people before he returned for his sixth sortie in adverse flying conditions, during which the helicopter crashed. He is survived by his father, mother, wife, a young daughter and a son.
