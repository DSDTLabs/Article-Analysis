HYDERABAD: Despite warnings against  , scores of people are spotted moving freely on railway tracks in the twin cities. From January 2017, around 600 persons have been booked for trespassing and fined over Rs 14 lakh in the Hyderabad and Secunderabad divisions.

 Many unauthorized people get onto the tracks through narrow channels, which have been made deliberately to evade the eyes of ticket checking staff or security guards. Using these passages, miscreants often create a nuisance at night by consuming alcohol, smoking ganja, gambling, besides indulging in other prohibited activities near the tracks.
 
  
 Even though   sleuths being deputed at various stations regularly for patrolling, trespassing has become a major cause for concern. This, despite recent deaths of youths taking selfies on the tracks kicking up a storm across the nation.
 
 Many passengers allege that the cops, more often than not, turn a blind eye to such trespassing, which takes place alongside tracks at Necklace Road, Hafizpet, James Street, Begumpet, Sanjeevaiah Park, Borabanda, Hi-Tec City and Malakpet.
 
 The Railways Act 1989 states that anyone on railway tracks can be categorised as a trespasser, including commuters who have paid for their tickets. Police sources say it is MMTS passengers who mostly resort to crossing the railway tracks.
 
 “The MMTS service is not as frequent as the  . If a passenger misses a train, the person has to wait 40 minutes to an hour to get the next train. That is why people avoid climbing foot-overbridges to save time and put their life at risk by walking down tracks,” a RPF personnel told TOI.
 
 In most cases, a single cop is deployed to keep vigil at a crowded platform during peak hours, and if he stands near one end of the platform, he can’t see a violation taking place at the other end.
