  Though the   actor is tight-lipped about his role, he says, “I play the character of Lavan in the movie. This would be the first film in which I will be essaying the lead role, and I will be speaking some Tamil in it as well. It is an investigation comedy.”
 
  Gireesh Mano says that Lava and Kusha are easily relatable characters. “Both their characters are loud and innocent at the same time, and are more like caricatures. The film is about their friendship and the bond that they share with each other.” He adds that actor BIju Menon plays an equally prominent role in the movie. 
 
 Neeraj is however quick to add that though it is a run-of-the-mill story, it has lot of fun elements in it.

There will be lots of humour involving the characters of Aju and me.” The film will have music and dance too, he says. So, will the audience get to see Aju Varghese shaking a leg too? “Yes! The experience of shooting the song was quite fun. We just wrapped up the shoot of one such typical mass song, choreographed by Brindha master.”
