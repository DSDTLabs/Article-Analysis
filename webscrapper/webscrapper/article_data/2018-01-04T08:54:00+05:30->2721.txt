 KOCHI: The state received normal rainfall last year during both monsoon periods with the overall deficiency during each season ranging between 6 % to 7% only. However, experts say that the state could face shortage of groundwater recharge as not many steps have been taken to prevent the overflow into the sea. 

 "If one were to look at the rainfall in the bimonthly periods of June-July, August-September and October-December, then we have got adequate rainfall," said C K  , weather expert. In 2016, the state had faced about 40% rain deficiency.
 
 
  
 
 Indian meteorological department said the monsoon was widely distributed last year. The southern districts received good rainfall while Northern districts saw less rainfall. "We will look into the monsoon behaviour this year too before we initiate some kind of study on whether there is any pattern in deficiency of rainfall in some north   districts," said S Sudevan, regional director, IMD, Thiruvananthapuram. There will be less re-charging of groundwater in the northern districts.
 
 Rajan said there is 30-40 km distance between sea-shore and mountains and yet there is a huge deficiency in groundwater because of the undue exploitation of rivers by sand-mining and uprooting of trees on both sides of the river banks.
 
 According to the weather department, the likelihood of rainfall in the state in the next week is very slim.
 
 There was no rainfall in Kerala and Lakshadweep and there has not been any major change in minimum temperature during the past 24 hours. Vellanikkara recorded the lowest minimum temperature of 20 degrees celsius.
