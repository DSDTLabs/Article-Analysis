VADODARA:   are yet to begin investigation into the alleged loot that happened at the   even as three days have passed since the complaint was lodged. 

 The case, which had generated lot of heat with a social worker alleging that a girl was gang-raped there, was handed over to assistant commissioner of police for fair investigation. Hiten Dabhi, a 19-year-old who was the girl’s friend, had registered a complaint of loot last week after the cops began inquiry about an alleged gang rape by two persons.
 
 “We will prepare sketches of the accused and then begin search for them,” said M A Patel, ACP, (C division). Police said that the accused could be from the adjacent locality. The case had earlier sent the cops into tizzy after claims of a girl, who is Dabhi’s friend, being gangraped began doing rounds. A city-based social worker had approached the police and later the girl too was taken to the police station.
 
 She, however, had refused to file any complaint. Police later met the girl and conducted a detailed inquiry in which she said that she wasn’t raped. The cops video-recorded her and Dabhi’s statements. The inquiry, however, confirmed that Dabhi and the girl were looted by three persons who fled with their mobile phones and cash. Though the police have ruled out possibility of gangrape, city   leaders have alleged negligence on the part of cops.
 
 Vice president of city Congress, Shailesh Amin said that the police didn’t act quickly in the matter. “The cops should have filed a suo-motu case and started investigations. They didn’t act when she came to the police station,” Amin said.
