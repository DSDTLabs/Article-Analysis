 The complicated surgery took nine hours. “Around 80 percent of the retrieval of organ (uterus) was done laparoscopically and only towards the tail end of the surgery when we had to take out the organ (womb) from donor's body that we adopted open surgery method by taking a small incision so that vessels supplying blood to the uterus are not squeezed and damaged,” Puntambekar said.
 
 Since the majority of the retrieval part was done through minimally invasive key hole surgery medically known as laparoscopic surgery, the donor did not even require blood transfusion.
