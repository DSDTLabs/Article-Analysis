NEW DELHI: India has appreciated the US’ “proactive” response to the   in which an Indian tech professional Srinivas   was killed, refuting reports of India registering a protest. 

 Responding to reports that India has issued a demarche (diplomatic protest) to the US, MEA spokesperson said on Tuesday that the US actions had “obviated the need for a demarche by the government on this matter.” The shooting is seen as a hate crime and evoked strong reactions particularly in the Telugu community. 
 
 MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay detailed the actions, which included a commitment by US to “investigate thoroughly and prosecute the case. This approach is reflected in the sentiments and assurances from senior most authorities of Kansas…” 
 
 The Indian remarks followed the first reactions by the Trump White House to the killing, the timing of which was criticised in the US. “I don’t want to get ahead of the law enforcement, but … while the story is evolving, early reports out of Kansas are equally disturbing,” Trump’s press secretary   said. 
 
 Spicer had earlier rejected any connection between the strident tones of the Trump election campaign with the crime.
