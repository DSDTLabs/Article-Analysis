Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission (MPPSC) has postponed the recruitment exam for 3,000 assistant professors in the state. In a circular on Monday, the commission stated that the exam has been postponed till further notice. 

 The circular stated that the higher education department has filed a special leave petition with the MP high court and had requested the commission to put the recruitment on hold till further notice. 
 
 Around 20,000 candidates had applied for assistant professor’s exam which was to be conducted by Madhya Pradesh Public Service Commission (MPPSC) after a gap of 25 years to fill vacancies in government colleges. Initially the last date for applying was February 14, but it was extended to March 1 and subsequently March 15 after request from several candidates.
 
 After a gap of more than two decades, MPPSC had invited applications for filling assistant professor’s posts in 2014 but the recruitment process was cancelled in September 2015 following eligibility related issues.
 
 Incidentally, the college guest faculty were also demanding from higher education department to not to hold the exam. They felt that recruiting assistant professors through MPPSC would snatch their opportunity of getting merged with the department.
