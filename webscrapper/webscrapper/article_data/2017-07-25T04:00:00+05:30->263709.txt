Vadodara: The state government has initiated an inquiry against M S University’s top brass. 

 After receiving complaints of misappropriation of grants and irregularities, an officer appointed by the higher education department of the state government on Monday visited MSU campus where it met MSU’s top brass including vice-chancellor (VC) professor Parimal Vyas and   Neerja Jaiswal. 
 
 The officer – Dr K G Chhaya – who has been appointed by the commissioner of higher education also met the complainants including senate member Kapil Joshi and MSU’s former chief accounts officer (CAO) Umesh Oza separately at the circuit house. “Presently, I am just gathering information from everybody. But I can assure that the inquiry will be on right track without any pressure and with full transparency to ensure justice into the matter,” Chhaya told TOI. 
 
 Joshi has alleged irregularities to the tune of Rs 10 crore while Oza in his communication to the state government had alleged financial irregularities to the tune of Rs five crore by Vyas and Jaiswal.
 
 Ironically, MSU itself has appointed a probe committee to inquiry into the allegations of corruption levelled by Oza. The committee headed by retired judge of the Gujarat High Court Dhiren Karia has so far held one meeting. 
 
 It was on June 20 that after facing backlash from several quarters, the university’s top brass had announced the formation of a six-member committee which apart from justice Karia, consisted of former VC of Gujarat University Naresh Ved, advocate Bhaskar Tanna and three chartered accountants Milin Mehta, Sanjeev Shah and another from C R Sharedalal and Co. 
 
 But the committee’s formation itself had come under question on the very next day when Mehta, who refused to be part of the panel, called it an eyewash.
