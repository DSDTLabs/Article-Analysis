Mumbai:   (RIL) will sell some of its shale assets in Texas, US, to   for $100 million. 

 The transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and will be the second such sale by RIL in recent months. In October 2017, the company had announced the sale of its shale assets in Pennsylvania, US, to   for $126 million, taking a 60% knock on its original acquisition price of $392 million.
 
 These divestitures indicate the $51-billion RIL’s waning interest in US shale gas. RIL’s partners,   and   in the Eagle Ford, Texas assets, too have sold their interests in these blocks. Pioneer divested its stake for $102 million and it plans to sell the balance Eagle Ford shale portfolio too. 
 
 RIL, however, intends to retain its interest in the remaining Eagle Ford assets as according to the company, those are core to its “development priorities”. Some eight years ago, RIL had started to place its bet on shale gas and had invested at least $3 billion in various properties in the US. But, around three years ago, it began to pull out from these ventures. In 2014, RIL and Pioneer announced the sale of their stakes in Eagle Ford’s shale oil and gas transportation and distribution joint venture, a development described by analysts as a precursor of RIL’s plan to exit from US shale.
