BHAGALPUR: Apprehending that former   (BAU) vice-chancellor and suspended JD (U) MLA Mewa Lal Choudhary may escape to foreign country, the Bhagalpur police have initiated proceedings to get a lookout notice issued against him. A move has also been made to get his passport impounded.

 The grapevine has it that the former VC may try to flee or may have fled to Nepal. In that case, the lookout notice would come handy for the police to make him surrender or get him deported, sources said.
 
 A police officer said a lookout notice ensures effective monitoring of the entry or exit of the absconding person by all the agencies concerned across the country. It is especially helpful in preventing the escape of such a person through international borders via land, seaports and airports.
 
 Choudhary is the main accused in an FIR (number 35/17) lodged by the BAU registrar at the Sabour police station on February 21 in connection with several appointments made in BAU.
 
 He has been made accused under various IPC Sections, including 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 420 (cheating and dishonesty), 467 (forgery), 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).
 
 Choudhary’s anticipatory bail petition has been rejected by a Bhagalpur court. He has been absconding for over 15 days now.
 
 The founder VC of BAU at Sabour in Bhagalpur district, Choudhary served the university since its inception in 2010 till 2015. In 2015, he became MLA from Tarapur (Munger district) on ruling JD (U) ticket. 
 
 Bhagalpur SSP Manoj Kumar said on Monday a formal request has been made to the state government which in turn would take the help of the central government to get a lookout notice issued against the former VC. “We are, in the meantime, leaving no stoine unturned to nab the former VC,” the SSP added.
