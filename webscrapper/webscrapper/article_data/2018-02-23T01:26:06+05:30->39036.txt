NEW DELHI: The capital’s image of being a city on a short fuse got re-established this week when three people were assaulted in   incidents in  , Jagatpuri and Ghazipur — all in east Delhi.

 
 In Jagatpuri, a 23-year-old law student, Shubham Dixit, suffered injuries on the head and a broken shoulder after his neighbours, Sumit, Sunal and Ravi, thrashed him on Monday evening for moving their motorcycle from in front of his house to park his own two-wheeler. 
 
 “I moved it a little ahead to park my bike. Suddenly, they came and asked me how dare I moved their vehicle,” Dixit told cops. Later, they entered Dixit’s house and hit him with sticks in front of his mother and sister. The accused have been sent to judicial custody.
 
 In Vivek Vihar, a cabbie was thrashed and his Maruti WagonR was damaged by four people coming in a Hyundai i10 on Wednesday night when he was coming out of a CNG station. 
 
  told the police that after hitting his car from behind, the men, coming from a wedding, started arguing with him. Soon the men started thrashing Pandey, who finally ran into a nearby police station to save himself. Besides a head injury, a few of Pandey’s fingers also got fractured. 
 
 While many passersby stopped to record the incident on their phones, none tried to stop the fight, the victim said. In a video, a man in his 50s and wearing a silver suit is seen trying to break the windshield of Pandey’s car. Another man, in a maroon kurta, is seen hitting the car repeatedly with a stick. 
 
 A case for causing hurt and under the motor vehicles act has been registered against the accused, who are out on bail.
 
 In Ghazipur, a businessman, Manish, was thrashed for not giving way to another car in a narrow lane around 1.40am on Thursday. The police said the occupants of the Maruti Alto pulled out the Maruti Swift driver and beat him with rods. When Manish resisted, they smashed the windows of his car with the same rods. A case has been registered.
