KOCHI: Coming down heavily again on the   (VACB), the high court on Wednesday said the agency has been indulging in "anarchic actions of excess". The   director would have to be summoned to the court if such actions continue, the court warned. 

 The chief of the anti-corruption agency came under court's criticism while it was considering a petition filed by   of   challenging an FIR registered against him and former finance minister KM Mani regarding a tax exemption given to manufacturers of lead oxide through the Finance Act, 2015. 
 
 In an interim order issued on Wednesday, a single bench of the court said: "Here is a very strange situation of anarchic actions of excess on the part of the VACB in Kerala. The petitioner, herein, happened to avail the benefit of a budget proposal made by the government then in power and the said proposal has now become part of the finance Act passed by the Kerala legislative assembly. The VACB is now probing into the corruption elements in the said legislative Act. If the VACB goes to that extent, something will have to be done by the high court."
 
 Asking the investigating officer in the case to explain what powers allow VACB to pursue such an action, the court said if it is not satisfied with the explanation, the director of VACB will have to be summoned to court to show cause against actions in similar matters pending before the court.
 
 Further, the court directed the chief secretary and the secretaries of departments of finance as well as home and vigilance department to file separate statements explaining the stand of the state government in such matters of excess on the part of VACB.
 
 In a statement filed to the court, VACB had stated that the FIR was lodged on a prima facie presumption that "passing of a legislation amounts to an act of conspiracy and corruption by the petitioner and the minister concerned." A loss of Rs1.66 crore is alleged to have occurred due to the relaxation in tax.
