A special court issued fresh summons on Saturday against a company and two of its directors accused in a money laundering case related to the Rs 3,600-crore VIP chopper deal. The court had earlier issued an open-ended non-bailable warrant against alleged middleman Christian Michel James, a British national, in the case. An open-ended NBW carries no time limit for execution.

 Special judge   re-issued the summons against Media Exim Private Limited and its directors R K Nanda and  , asking them to be present in court on February 22.
 
 The firm was set up by James, Nanda and Subramaniyam. The order came after the   (ED) informed the court that the summons issued against the three on the last date of hearing could not be executed.
 
 In its investigation, the ED found out that James had allegedly received about Rs 225 crore from AgustaWestland that was nothing but “kickbacks” paid by the firm to execute the deal for sale of 12 helicopters to India in favour of the firm in “guise” of genuine transactions for performing multiple work contracts in the country.
