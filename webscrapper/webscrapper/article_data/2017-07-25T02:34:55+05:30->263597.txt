GURUGRAM: More cases of   have been reported from   than rural areas, in the last quarter, according to data provided by officials of   (DHBVN).

 In the last three months, the suburban division of the discom raided around 150 houses in the   and detected power thefts cases worth around Rs 1.2 crore. The suburban division includes the DLF areas,  .
 
 The total collection from these three areas in the past quarter was around Rs 3.5 crore from 328 house raids.
 
 On the other hand, in the Badshapur (rural) sub-division, discom officials have raided 49 houses and collected around Rs 2 crore.
 
 “The number of cases reported from DLF areas have been the maximum in every month of the last quarter. However, the reason could also be that more cases are reported from these areas, as compared to other areas,” said a discom official.
 
 According to discom officials,   in urban areas of new Gurgaon are mostly in places where people are consuming power way beyond their sanctioned loads, while in rural areas, cases of ‘hooking’ illegal connections from electric lines are more prevalent.
 
 “A lot of these cases have been reported from unauthorised PGs running in these societies,” said an official. For instance, a house with a sanctioned load of 5 kW is actually consuming 10 kW of power, he added.
 
 He added this causes major losses to the discom and costs them Rs 1,750 per kW. It also causes losses through the exploitation of power supply infrastructure, which in turn causes defaults and power cuts.
