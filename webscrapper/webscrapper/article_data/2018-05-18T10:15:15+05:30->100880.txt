CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal on Thursday questioned the Punjab government as to what stops it in acting against the leader of opposition   if it accepts him a member of international drug cartel.

 SAD spokesperson   said it was strange to see that the Punjab government has filed an affidavit in Fazilka court declaring   as ‘member of international drug cartel’ but was reluctant to act against him for reasons best known to it. Sirsa said the government is duty bound to act against a ‘criminal’ who is accused in drug smuggling case.
 
 Supreme Court had granted temporary relief to Khaira which was only on summoning issue and there is no bar on taking action against a ‘drug smuggler and supplier’ when the government has admitted Khaira’s role of being a member of the cartel, said Sirsa. He added if the government is reluctant to act against Khaira then it shows the Congress party is hand in glove with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its leader.
 
 Sirsa also attacked the AAP convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal for not acting against Khaira when he has become an accused in drug smuggling case. Sirsa said that Kejriwal’s silence on Khaira issue is intriguing as he always makes hue and cry on petty issues but is silent on a serious charge of drug smuggling leveled against his own party MLA who he has been given constitutional post of leader of opposition.
