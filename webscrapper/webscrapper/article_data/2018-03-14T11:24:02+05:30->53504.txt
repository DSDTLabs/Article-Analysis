LUCKNOW: A month after he raised the hackles of the   government by accusing it of being corrupt and failing on the law and order front, cabinet minister and   (SBSP) chief Om Prakash   is ready to support BJP in the   elections. 

 Comparing himself with four Supreme Court judges who revolted against Chief Justice of India Deepak Mishra over his style of functioning, Rajbhar on Tuesday said he would continue to speak against the government as and when required but would stand by his political ally BJP.
 
 "We would openly criticize the government if it does something wrong. But we will support the party," Rajbhar told TOI, a day after BJP fielded 11 candidates to counter the united opposition in the Rajya Sabha elections. "I did not say anything wrong. It is my right to point out the mistake of the dispensation, even though I am a part of it. Even the Supreme Court judges had spoken out against the Chief Justice," Rajbhar said.
 
 BJP is a strong political force that cannot be defeated even if all the opposition parties unite, he said.
 
  Rajbhar said his party was happy to be an ally of BJP whose presence in the country has been growing despite opposition's claims of steps like demonetisation and application of GST hitting common people.
 
 SBSP has four MLAs, including Rajbhar. 
 
 He is cabinet minister for backward and handicap welfare in the Yogi Adityanath government. Last month, he had accused the government of being lackadaisical in day-to-day functioning and failing to control the law and order situation despite the CM's intervention.
