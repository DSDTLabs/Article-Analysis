GUWAHATI: The state assembly on Thursday unanimously demanded that the state government facilitate the completion of  's 2,000-MW  , which is located in   but has been stalled by Assam-based anti-dam protest groups since 2011. 

 "The project should be completed soon for the development of Assam. So, talk to the people of Assam and the groups and take them into confidence," speaker Hitendra Nath Goswami said.
 
 The unanimous demand from the house came after BJP MLA Debananda Hazarika raised the issue.
 
 "It is good to see that all members are unanimous. This is an important issue and has public interest involved in it. The matter should be solved immediately. Without power, industrialisation is not possible. I hope the government will take the matter ahead from here," the speaker added.
 
 Speaking on behalf of the government, minister of state for power, Pallab Lochan Das said the state government is interested in talking to all opposing groups and assured that chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal will take the initiative in this regard.
 
 "Almost 56% work in NHPC's Subansiri project remains complete. The expert committee formed after the protests against it made many recommendations, including redesigning of the dam. NHPC has accepted all the recommendations," Das said.
 
 The project located on the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border is the biggest hydroelectric project undertaken in India so far and is a run-of-the-river scheme on the Subansiri river. The anti-dam protesters fear devastating effects on the downstream region of the project, which will entirely be in Assam and not in Arunachal Pradesh. On the other hand, Assam stands to get 533 MW of power generated from the project.
 
 The protests, that began in 2011, have been spearheaded by the  , the All Assam Students' Union and the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chhatra Parishad. The project was scheduled to be commissioned in December 2012.
