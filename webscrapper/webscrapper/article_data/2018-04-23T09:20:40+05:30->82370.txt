AHMEDABAD: Over the past year,   reported 6,429 children missing — or about 18 children per day — according to the portal of the National Tracking System for Missing and Vulnerable Children. Gujarat state police tracks the missing children on the basis of details available, in coordination with multiple agencies including observation homes in Gujarat and other states. 

 Expanding the scope, thanks to the centralized database of lost and found children, the state   (crime) has launched a project to track 154 children in 15 states. CID teams will go to these states and verify details. Earlier, CID had brought back 10 kids from observation homes in Mumbai.
 
 Anil Pratham, ADGP, CID (crime), said that through the national database and coordination with different state agencies, police have got information that there might be kids from Gujarat in other states. “We have prepared a list of these kids,” he said. “Their details will be verified after which the process of bringing them to the state will be initiated.” The kids are identified on the basis of their own statements or their mother tongue, said CID officials.
 
 “Simultaneously, we are also preparing a database of children in Gujarat’s observation homes to know their domicile so that similar process of sending them to their families can be initiated,” said Pratham.
