 Kurla RPF inspector Suresh Atri said, “I have bought a few crutches which I offer them to stand with for a few minutes, apart from imposing a fine. It is a way of telling them that if you want to travel in coaches meant for the handicapped, then start using crutches.” He said no amount of pleading and counselling had any effect and regular action too failed to deter them.

 Kurla RPF prosecuted 821 commuters this year and collected Rs 83,450 in fines; 1,037 cases were handled by ticket checking staff, which yielded fines of Rs 3.80 lakh.
 
 Apart from imposing Section 154, Kurla RPF has also begun taking action under Sections 145 A (causing inconvenience to other commuters) and 147 (misuse of railway). In such cases, the fine is Rs 1,100 instead of the usual Rs 500. Failure to pay the fine leads to imprisonment for 11 days.
