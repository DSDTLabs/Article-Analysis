MUMBAI: Maharashtra Lokayukta M L Tahaliyani has summoned additional chief secretary (housing)   to record evidence in connection with the inquiry into charges that housing minister   cleared an irregular SRA scheme at Tardeo’s M P Mill Compound.   has been called on February 21.

 The probe was ordered following the opposition pressure after TOI’s expose on July 12, 2017, which said that that Mehta’s decision to allow building rights granted to slum dwellers to be transferred to project affected people went against development control rules. On receiving TOI’s queries, the move was stayed by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis. The housing department had raised objections to the move in writing. Its note had said, “There is no provision in the DC rules which allows benefits granted to eligible slumdwellers to be withdrawn or transferred.”
 
 However,   had gone against the advice of his department and cleared the proposal on June 21, 2017. While sanctioning it, he had written on the file, “The chief minister has been informed.” Later, on the floor of the state assembly, he backtracked from this claim. Earlier this month, Mehta defended himself before the Lokayukta. He said that his clearance of the scheme was contingent on the slum society approving of it through a general body resolution.
