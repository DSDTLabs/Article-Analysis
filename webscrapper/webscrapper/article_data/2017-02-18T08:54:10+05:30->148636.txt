 The chief minister said, Goa urgently needs to put in place permanent infrastructure to host events like defence expo, aero show and international film festival of India (Iffi) in the state. “We will create infrastructure to hold events like aero show and defence expo in the state,” he added.
 
 He also said that infrastructure can be created at the airport at Mopa for hosting aero show. “Let the popular government take a decision,” Parsekar said. “We have to give priority to such events,” he said further.
