QUEPEM: The children’s park in the garden at the centre of Quepem has finally attained popularity — among cattle. The park, renovated a few years ago at a cost of Rs 1.2 crore, has turned into a safe resting place for stray cows and buffalos.   said that cattle wandering along the   highway that touches the garden amble in at any time of the day. 

 “I go for a morning walk around the garden,” said  , a senior citizen. “I have noticed stray cattle taking shelter and resting there almost every morning.” 
 
 The cattle pound set up by the Quepem municipal council ( ) a few years ago continues to be unused, as the park, loaded with equipment for children to play, seems a more convenient facility to walk into after a weary day. 
 
 Councillor   told TOI that stray cattle can be seen daily in the garden. While the park is frequented by many children and their parents, many other stay clear of it thanks to the cow dung and stench in the park. 
 
 Colaco said that the QMC appointed four persons to look after stray cattle and a cattle pound keeper, but that the job isn’t being done.
