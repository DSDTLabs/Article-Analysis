NAVI MUMBAI:   undertook a mega tree   on July 15.   were invited to plant trees of their own choice at various points on the premies. 

 Cidco provided ready pits and manure. More than 100 enthusiasts from various nodes of the city and Mumbai took part in the drive (in pic). 
 
 They planted around 200 saplings of fruit-bearing trees like mango, guava, tamarind, jackfruit, orange and cashewnut. “We had longed to do such a thing but could not due to lack of space. We are thankful to Cidco for providing us such an opportunity.” Heavy rains did not hamper the spirit of the participants who also enjoyed the beauty and natural sights.
