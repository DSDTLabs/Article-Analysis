Erode: Following the recent rainfall coupled with sudden change in weather condition, the entire Dhimbam Ghat Road is covered with   for the past two days, obscuring visibility for motorists, especially heavy vehicle drivers, during night time. 

 “We could not drive through the thick fog,” said K Rajasekar, one of the van drivers, who commutes daily between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to deliver vegetables. He said he drives slowly while crossing Dhimbam Ghat Road due to the fog.
 
 About 90% of the heavy vehicle drivers park their trucks somewhere nearer the ghat section during night time, fearing fatal accidents. 
 
 Meanwhile, the forest department and highway patrol police have advised the vehicle drivers to use head lights and fog lights while using ghat road. They have also been advised to use horns while navigating hairpin bends as the visibility of vehicles coming in the opposite direction will be poor. 
 
 The forest department has advised heavy vehicle drivers to park their vehicles either at Bannari or Asanur forest check posts.
