NAVI MUMBAI: Residents of Kharghar, Taloja, Dronagiri and Ulwe will not get regular supply of   till Tuesday due to a pipeline burst at Jambhulpada on Sunday. The supply was disrupted since Sunday evening after a container overturned on the main supply line from   dam.

 Though the damaged portion was repaired in the wee hours of Monday, ensuring resumption of supply,   officials said full supply in all affected areas, including high- rise zones, would be possible on Tuesday. “Our team worked the whole night to seal the  ,” said a Cidco official.
 
 Those who get the supply in the evening were left high and dry on Sunday evening due to the sudden disruption. Meanwhile, certain sectors of Dronagiri and Ulwe started getting supply on Monday afternoon, as these two nodes are enroute from the supply line whereas Kharghar and Taloja are tail-end users. “We got low-pressure supply for 10-15 minutes on Monday morning, which was not sufficient,” said Ulwe resident Subhash Sharma.
 
 Rajesh Haatvar, Cidco executive engineer, water supply, said supply was restored in many sectors on Monday morning but with low pressure.
 
 But residents of most of the areas in Kharghar and Taloja complained that they were still not getting water, as it takes time to build the pressure in the supply line. “It has become a problem as Cidco has failed to provide adequate drinking water. Their supply system experiences shutdowns and technical glitches every now and then,” said Kharghar resident Amarjeet Saluja.
 
 Another resident Ritu Sharma said that the situation was alarming in sector 21. “Water supply is very erratic and we are being told to change the pipeline every time we complain of acute shortage,” she added.
 
 Haatvar said they would restore supply at full pressure in all areas by Tuesday evening. “It takes at least 24 hours to restore complete pressure,” he added.
