VADODARA: The   mast in the state at Sama in the city was damaged for the third time within a month. The   (VMC) has sought an explanation in this regard from the agency that executed the project.

 The large national flag was unfurled on the eve of the Independence Day by chief minister Vijay Rupani. Hundreds thronged to see it every day and it became a major attraction. The flag was first damaged on August 24 and was replaced.
 
 Even the new flag was torn on September 1, sparking a major row with the opposition in the   crying foul. A chargesheet was issued to the in-charge chief fire officer as prompt action was not taken to bring the flag down to avoid the controversy.
 
 A decision was taken against hoisting the flag again immediately as it was believed that the rains may be the reason for the damage. The flag was hoisted again on September 10, but was damaged again on September 13.
 
  said that the same agency had erected such flag poles across the country, but flags at other locations were not being damaged. “We are roping in experts to do a detailed study to find out the reason for the damage to the flag,” said Rao.
 
 The 67 meter high flag mast is the highest in the state and has been installed near the Sama Pond. The civic body is also planning to have a flag park at the site with flags of all the countries of the world around the Tricolour. For now, the flag has been brought down and may not be put up till experts give their opinion.
