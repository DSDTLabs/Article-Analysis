NEW DELHI: The   (NDMC) submitted two proposals to the   (NDTA) for pedestrianisation of Connaught Place (CP), which were, however, rejected by the traders.

 NDTA also called for a shutdown of   till 3pm on Tuesday.
 
 The council had prepared the proposals after seeking suggestions from all stakeholders. Chairman, NDMC, Naresh Kumar said that two possibilities were identified by the council to take up the project for pedestrianisation of CP market.
 
 “In the first proposal, we suggested allowing vehicles in the middle circle and leave the inner circle free of vehicles. And in the second proposal, we suggested making the entire CP market vehicle-free zone,” said Kumar.
 
 “We are trying to bring all the stakeholders on board. A meeting will be called up with the traders association this week to discuss the plan,” he said.
 
 Kumar also said, “We are still working on deployment of battery vehicles and exploring other aspects to ensure implementation of the project do not lead to any chaos. The pedestrianisation of CP is likely to start from last week of February.”
 
 However, rejecting the NDMC proposals, NDTA president Atul Bhargava said, “The council had given us two alternatives and we rejected both. They want to turn a commercial place like CP into a tourist destination.”
 
 “Their proposals are weak, which will only cause problems for visitors and the traders will have to face the heat of their irresponsible decision. Already, during demonetisation we faced a lot of issues. Not even a single trader is in favour of this decision,” he added.
 
 Bhargava added, “On Tuesday we have called a meeting with all the traders and all shops will remain shut till 3pm as a sign of our silent protest. At the meeting, we will discuss the issue and prepare a proposal for pedestrianisation of CP market. We will also take up the matter with NDMC.”
