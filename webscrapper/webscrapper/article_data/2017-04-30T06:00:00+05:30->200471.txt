Visakhapatnam: Jewellery shops across the city had a busy day as a large number of people visited them to buy gold ornaments as part of Akshaya Tritiya on Saturday. 

 Although the scorching heat kept Vizagites indoors till afternoon, they soon began to make their way to the stores as the sun began to set.
 
 Nearly a dozen showrooms on Sampath Vinayaka Temple Road and Town Kotha Road saw huge crowd and the jewellers were more than happy with the increased business.
 
 “Majority of the sales are small purchases. People want to buy some amount of gold as it is an auspicious occasion. The morning sales were not much due to the high temperatures, but usually the crowed starts picking up in the evening,” said the manager of a gold showroom on Sampath Vinayaka Temple Road.
 
 Another jeweller Sriram Murthy of Old Town area said, “After several days, we are seeing good business. But, one thing we are noticing is that more number of people are opting for card transactions rather than cash.” However, he said, “The sales have not increased much as compare to last year.”
