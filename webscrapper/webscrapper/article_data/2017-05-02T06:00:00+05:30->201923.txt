Visakhapatnam: Despite being one of the oldest localities in the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) limits,   has several civic issues that are overlooked by the corporation. 

 There are nearly 500 households and 200 commercial establishments in the area. But denizens are forced to reside amid poor sanitation, choked drains, damaged roads, irregular water supply, defunct street lights, the menace of street dogs as well as lack of community halls and public toilets.
 
 P Someswara Rao, a general store owner opposite the vegetable market, said, “Cattle, mosquitoes, cats and dogs are commonly seen in the area due to all the waste dumped on the road. The civic authorities should plan permanent measures to facilitate speedy garbage removal and ensure that the people dump their waste in a proper manner.”
 
 S Srinivas, an APSRTC conductor, said, “I am a regular visitor to the market since the last 15 years. There has been no improvement of the locality, particularly the sanitation. I wonder how GVMC manages to bag the top position in cleanliness challenges when areas such as Poorna Market are in such a miserable condition.” 
 
 The GVMC officials attributed the sorry state of the area to many reasons including crowd. “Despite our continuous efforts, there has been no improvement in the attitude of the people living in the area. However, we will continue our efforts to keep the area clean,” said a senior GVMC official.
 
 Apart from solutions to the regular civic issues, the residents have also demanded proper bus shelters in the area. APSRTC deputy chief traffic manager (urban) G Satyanarayana alos admitted that there should be a proper bus shelter for passengers near Durgalamma temple junction.
