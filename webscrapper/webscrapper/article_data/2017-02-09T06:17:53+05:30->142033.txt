CHANDIGARH:   president Captain   on Wednesday ridiculed SAD's Patiala candidate General (retd)  's “senseless and irrelevant statements about him contesting from the constituency“, terming it as a sign of his “desperation in the face of imminent defeat and a reflection of his mental instability, which was becoming more and more accentuated by the day as the outcome of the election was becoming clearer.“

 After having declared his intention not to work for those who voted against him in Patiala, Singh has now claimed that his decision to contest the poll was motivated by his desire to serve the people of the area. What's more, he has started blaming his own party workers for his inevitable defeat, accusing them of supporting Amarinder, his rival candidate from Patiala.
 
 Amarinder said the former Army chief 's statements proved he was a misfit in Pati ala, “which is one large family where everyone respects each other.“
 
 In a statement here on Wednesday , the Congress chief ministerial candidate said J J Singh had lost all credibility as a serious leader in the eyes of the people of Patiala and should not demean himself and the high institution of the Army from which he hails with his idiotic comments.
 
 Amarinder trashed Singh's claim that he had received immense love from the people of Patiala, saying it was obvious that the former Chief of Army Staff was unable to accept his inevitable defeat and had started hallucinating things. He added that the SAD candidate was bound to end up forfeiting his security deposit.
 
 Questioning Singh's tall claims of having served the nation as Chief of Army Staff and as Governor, Captain Amarinder challenged his   from   to list down just one notable achievement he had made during his official tenures.
