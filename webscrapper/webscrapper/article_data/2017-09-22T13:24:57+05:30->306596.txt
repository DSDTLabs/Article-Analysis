MANGALURU: Taking a cue from the  , that has claimed several young lives across the globe, a   has introduced a similar game, but with positive outcomes.

 Rise Up Game, or RUG, poses 30 challenges to be taken in 30 days. These include visiting an orphanage and clicking a selfie with parents or guardian during a meal. Those who complete at least 25 challenges will be rewarded with an e-certificate. 
 
 “We contacted a lot of people from different walks of life, including teachers and parents. We have inculcated most of the suggestions we received,” Harish Neermarga, CEO,  , told reporters.
 
 “Each of the challenges is totally safe and very interesting. People can even submit challenges, which will be scrutinized by our team and the chosen ones will be posted online. There are various categories depending on factors such as age and profession. The 30 questions will be spread across three levels. Each level will have two lifelines, in case the user finds a challenge difficult or irrelevant,” he said.
 
 Dawn Prakash, coordinator, SDM Health Care Management, who first came up with the idea, said, “The day I first heard about the  , I decided I had to do something. I took the advice of my teacher and then contacted Neermarga.”
 
 “We studied the modus operandi of the   Challenge and learnt how it influences young minds. RUG works on similar lines, but creates a positive impact on the user,” Neermarga said. “We hope the users switch over to our interesting challenges rather than taking up challenges that harm lives or property. This will certainly make kids better human beings,” he added.
 
 According to the founders of RUG, the app cost them Rs 1.25lakh, but they did not and will not approach advertisers. “We feel good that we could do something for society. The intention is to create positive minds. There is no plan to make money,” Neermarga said.
 
 The game will be available on Google Playstore from September 30.
