HYDERABAD: The past week has been a nightmare for  's family. Not only did they had to come to terms with her gruesome murder but, adding salt to their wounds, was the fact that the killer was right under their noses. Speaking to TOI, Chandini's family members on Wednesday said that they had met the accused twice after the murder.

 The deceased girl's elder sister Nivedita confessed that the boy's behaviour was never out of the ordinary. “We did not even suspect this boy for a second. Even after my sister's murder, we met him twice, once at the police station and then at the DCP's office. On both occasions, he was very cordial and didn't give us a reason to suspect,“ she said.
 
 While she agreed that Chandini and the male friend, who is currently in police custody, were very close, she denied that her sister was in a relationship with him.
 
 “My sister and the boy studied together from class 6 to class 10. I was their super senior in school. They were very good friends and used to go out with other friends every now then. More than that I don't think there was anything more between them,“ said Nivedita. She said after class 10, the boy had moved to college to pursue further studies while her sister remained in the same school and was studying in class 12.
 
 Demanding justice, she said, “Just because he is a juvenile, he should not be left off with a minor punishment,“ The Jains have been residing at Satyanarayana Enclave for the past nine years or so. On Wednesday, the residence was full of friends and well-wishers who came down to pay their condolences.
