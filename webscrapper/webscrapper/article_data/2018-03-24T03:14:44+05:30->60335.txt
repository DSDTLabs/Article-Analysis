NEW DELHI: BJP has been constantly raising raucous demands for his removal as minister and eviction from the   for being a disqualified MLA. But the restoration of his House membership on Friday only strengthens Kailash Gahlot’s position as the man steering key projects in the transport sector. 

 With the Delhi budget for 2018-19 scheduling ambitious plans for boosting public transport and inducting electric buses in the capital’s road system, Gahlot, as transport minister, will play a crucial role. Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta’s plea against his continuation as minister in Delhi high court is bound to become infructuous in the wake of the same court’s view that the   of the 20 Aam Aadmi Party   had violated the principle of natural justice and the   should, therefore, rehear the case.
 
 From an MLA working quietly in his Najafgarh constituency, Gahlot had been thrown into the limelight last May when he was made a minister. Testing as his stint as law and transport minister may be, it could not have been as big a challenge as the   case. Gahlot shared his thoughts about the past two months since the EC disqualification with TOI, saying, “I was able to face everything because I somewhere had the firm belief that we would get justice from the judiciary. Today I feel liberated.”
 
 He said that the bitter experience of losing the membership of the Assembly in January had helped all the 20 MLAs to bond and stand by each other. “The government also stood behind us and this has only made us stronger,” asserted Gahlot, a lawyer himself.
 
 Gupta, however, pointed out, “While the high court lifted the disqualification of Gahlot and the 19 other MLAs for now, the issue of office of profit is not yet settled and they are not yet absolved of the charge of violating the laws.”
