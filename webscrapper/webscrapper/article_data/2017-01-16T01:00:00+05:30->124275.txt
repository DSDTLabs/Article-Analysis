It was an adrenaline-packed Sunday morning, as the city came out on the streets for one of the most awaited sporting extravaganzas — the Mumbai Marathon. The super-charged event saw people of all ages in jerseys, with placards and banners for a cause, and above all, showing off the sporting spirit that Mumbai is so known for. Those who ran were cheered by the crowds with music, whistles, a dhol-taasha and some bhangra, too! 

  
  
 The early start saw the full marathon (42 km) being flagged off from CST and the 21 km half marathon, from  . And finally, all eyes were on the Dream Run, which had a mixed crowd of corporates, NGOs and society. Nothing seemed to hold back the participants — some ran with kids in tow, senior war veterans with a disability showed that nothing is impossible if you have the willpower to do it, and for yet others, it was simply about being there and advocating a cause close to their hearts. You had folks running for AIDS awareness, Parkinson’s disease, a cleaner Mumbai, reducing air pollution, education for girls, helping street children and the cause of farmers. Given the recent economic undercurrent, there was also an ‘ATM’; as someone remarked, ‘it’s running this time!’ Unmissable was the larger-than-life serpent slithering its way onto the track, in favour of men’s rights. Pushing, laughing and making their way with other runners were surgeons in their attire, ‘bees’ and Yamraj, too! Inspiration appeared in the way of the oldest contestant in the marathon, 103-year-old Dagadu Bhamre from Nashik, who proved his mettle in the 4.3 km senior citizen’s run.
