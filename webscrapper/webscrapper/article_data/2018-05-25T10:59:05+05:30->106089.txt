ALLAHABAD: Raising a pitch for Hindu-Shia bonhomie, UP Shia Waqf Board chief   on Thursday nominated Akhil Bharatiya Akhara Parishad (ABAP) chairman   as the patron of the Indian Shia Awami League (ISAL), a political outfit he had launched recently. 

 "People of Shia community have been neglected since Mughal period. They now want to prosper by joining the mainstream alongside Hindus, a community with which they have always shared a common bond,"   told reporters after meeting   at Baghambari Gaddi in presence of a large number of Hindu saints.
 
 Both Rizvi and Giri also jointly launched the official website of ISAL on the occasion. "The website will serve in bringing both Muslims (Shias) and Hindu's closer to each other and share a common platform. It will also work in mustering support for building Ram temple in  ," he added.
 
 "Hindu kings and people of the community have always come to the rescue of Shias. Now, it's our turn to support the cause of the Hindu community. Construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya is of utmost importance. From our side, all attempts are being made so that the temple is built at Ayodhya," he added.
