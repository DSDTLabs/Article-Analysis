Vadodara: The special purpose vehicle – Vadodara Smart City Development Ltd (VSCDL) – formed for the Smart City projects in the city cleared the proposal to establish the Integrated City Command and Control Centre (ICCCC). The VSCDL along with the city police had recently conducted pilot testing of the systems established by four vendors eyeing the project.

 The project will be taken up at a cost of Rs 83 crore by (n)Code Solutions, a division of state government undertaking GNFC Ltd. It will be setting up a series of CCTV cameras across the city along with other facilities. The existing systems of the civic body will also be integrated with the new CCTV network. Apart from CCTV surveillance, the system will have environment sensors, public address systems, emergency call boxes and automatic number plate readers. VSCDL board members saw a presentation by (n)Code Solutions following which the proposal was cleared.
 
 VMC commissioner and chairman of VSCDL Vinod Rao said that ICCCC will have a city operation and management room along with a data centre. A video wall will display feeds from all cameras across the city. Besides civic officials, personnel of the city police will also remain present in the room to monitor the feeds. Apart from CCTV feeds from new cameras, those from the existing Vadodara Eye network will be relayed to the new facility. Data from other systems like Geographical Information System, SCADA, complaint management and others will be relayed to the same facility. It will help in real time monitoring of situation in case of emergencies.
