NAGPUR: Unions operating in   (CIL) and its subsidiaries have threatened to go on a three-day strike following the governmentâ€™s move to merge Coal Mines Provident Fund (CMPF) into   (EPFO). City-based   (WCL) is also one of the CIL subsidiaries.

 Unions of Andhra Pradesh government-owned   will also be taking part in the agitation planned from June 19 to 21.
 
 The merger proposal was discussed during the wage negotiation meetings held last week between the five trade unions and the CIL management. All the unions cutting across party lines have opposed the move.
 
 CMPF is an exclusive fund for retirement benefits for CIL workers. EPFO, on the other hand, covers the private sector as well as those employed in some PSUs.
 
 Merging both funds will lead to a major loss in terms of pension to coal workers across cadres. This is because EPFO pension has been capped to a salary of Rs15,000, which gives a monthly payout of Rs7,500 at the most. Under CMPF, this is pegged at the actual salary. The merger is being considered since CMPF is not in a position to sustain payouts on its own.
 
 Around five lakh coal workers will be part of the strike. Last year too the unions had given a three-day strike call, but it ended earlier after the management initiated talks.
