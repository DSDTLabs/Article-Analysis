PATNA: The   (RSS) on Saturday expressed concern over the alleged rise in “jehadi” activities and declining Hindu population in neighbouring West Bengal, and called upon the countrymen to create awareness against the “communal politics of the   government”.
 
  Accusing the West Bengal government of patronising anti-national forces as part of its vote-bank politics, RSS’s Bihar-Jharkhand unit’s Kshetra Karyavah   said the recent vandalism in the Kaliyachak police station in Malda district and growing incidents of attack on security forces in West Bengal were posing a serious challenge to the national security.
  
  Singh was addressing a press conference in Patna on his return from Coimbatore where he attended a meeting of the  , the top policy making body of the RSS, from March 19 to 21.
  
  Singh said the Sabha adopted a resolution condemning the rise in “jehadi” violence and the “Muslim appeasement policy” of Mamata. It also urged the Centre to take action against the such violence.
  
  “Hindus constituted 78.45 % of West Bengal’s population in 1951. They are now 70.54% of the state’s population as per the 2011 census,” Singh regretted.
  
  Also present at the press meet were Patna Mahanagar’s   and Prant Prachar Pramukh Rajesh Kumar Pandey.
