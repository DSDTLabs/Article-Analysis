INDORE: Indoreans were overjoyed on Tuesday when they woke up and found that ISRO’s recently launched Cartosat-2 had taken its first   --- that of Holkar stadium.

 The space organisation had chosen to click   to demonstrate capabilities of the satellite’s on board cameras as the city is centrally located and that too at an elevation.
 
 "Indore is located on a plateau at a height of 550m above sea-level. The city is located in centre of country, thereby allowing highly-sensitive cameras onboard Cartosat-2 to capture a clear image and display its capability," said a senior scientist on condition of anonymity.
 
 “Holkar stadium is not just lucky for Indian cricket team but also for the city as well,” said city-based professional Anirudh Meda, who was mesmerised by the picture. "I was awestruck. It took me some time to actually let the feeling seep in," he said.
 
 A lot of Indoreans didn't know about the picture until late afternoon. It was only after it began doing rounds on social media platforms, the residents started going gaga over it.
 
 Software engineer, Gurleen Sudan, who initially thought that it was a Google image, was surprised when she saw Whatsapp forwards by many of her friends.
 
 "I am so proud to be an Indorean. Indore is indeed the best city in the country," said the beaming resident who video-called her school friends now based in the US to share her happiness.
 
 "After poha jalebi and sev, Indore will be known for Holkar stadium. The stadium was already famous but now it will be known across the world," said city-based photographer, Tanuj Dalal, gloating over the picture.
