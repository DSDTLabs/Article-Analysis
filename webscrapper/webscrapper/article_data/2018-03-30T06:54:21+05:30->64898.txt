BENGALURU: Come May 12, you could   and then hold up your inked finger proudly for a 5%-10%   or at an eatery.

 This was mooted by   N Manjunath Prasad, who will soon hold consultations with hoteliers and mall establishments to work out the logistics of this election-day drive. All to ensure Bengaluru votes in big numbers.
 
 Prasad told TOI that unlike in rural areas or some urban areas of other states, voter participation in the electoral process in Bengaluru is low. “In the 2013 assembly poll, Bengaluru recorded a turnout of 57% against the state tally of 71%. We hope that giving concessions on food and mall bills will encourage voters to stay back in the city and vote,” he said.
 
 Bengaluru’s 2014 Lok Sabha election turnout was nothing to be proud of, either: 52.3% against the state’s 70%. The 2015 BBMP election had recorded a poor show of 44%.
 
 Prasad said he spoke to hoteliers and mall establishments over phone, and received positive feedback to the concession move. “We’ll have a meeting with owners of hotels, restaurants, pubs, malls and multiplexes for a final say, on Friday or Saturday,” he said.
 
 The point that polls are being held on a Saturday has raised doubts whether Bengalureans will care enough to come out in large numbers and exercise their franchise.
