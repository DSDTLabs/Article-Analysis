LUCKNOW: Resident of Baluadda who saw Tuesday’s attack on   from a distance said though there was no justifying how the mob behaved, they could relate to the frustration. “Our patience was being tested for a long time and things came to a head on Tuesday. The public will take to streets if the administration does not wake up to its problems,” said Shyam Narayan Yadav, a retired joint director rank officer of the UP government.

 Yadav stays at Golden Crest apartments and is also the secretary of its residents’ welfare association. The multi-storey apartment is located where the mob vandalized three liquor shops on Tuesday.
 
 A countrymade liquor shop, beer shop and an English wine shop, all are located on a 50-metre stretch. As scores of tipplers throng the stretch every evening, half-a-dozen food joints have also come up there, making it difficult for people staying at Prag Narain Road to negotiate the area in motor vehicles.
 
 While locals were not against the outlets, they were miffed over the way drunkards loitered in the locality. “It seems like an open bar in the evening. You will see people holding glasses and drinking in cars, motorcycles or by the roadside,” said another Baluadda resident, D K Shukla, who works as a building supervisor.
 
 Members of three apartment blocks have forwarded complaints to  , the district magistrate, police and excise department and sent reminders as well. For instance, Yadav highlighted how two shops that were forcibly shut down are unathorised. “Our society has shot off three complaints to the DM and LDA in the past one-and-a-half years. Nothing has changed since. Let us hope something positive will happen now,” said Yadav.
