BENGALURU: After the row over “fake pictures” on social media platforms, the   and   are now trading barbs over lemons and their “superstitious” antecedents.

 The BJP on Wednesday aimed the first barb by posting a photograph of chief minister   campaigning with a lemon in his hand. “Campaigns with a lemon in hand, but brings in Anti Superstitions Bill to demean and criminalise Hindu traditions. Hypocrisy thy name is @siddaramaiah,” read the Twitter post.
 
 By late afternoon, the official handle of CM Siddaramaiah hit back, saying the BJP has no idea what superstition is. “When you visit a village people welcome you with lemon. That it is not superstition is known to all Kannadigas. Anti-Superstition Bill has become a law passed by Karnataka legislature. It does not demean any Hindu tradition. Learn about Karnataka before tweeting young fellows,” said Siddaramaiah.
 
 Tagging this post, the BJP released another couple of pictures with Siddaramaiah taking his chief ministerial seat with a lemon in one hand.
 
 “We are sure the same villager had presented you with a lemon at the time of your oath ceremony and before you sat for the first time on CM's chair. Mr. CM you have been an awesome liar over the last 5 years! Looks like age is now catching up!” said BJP’s official handle.
 
 Not to let the BJP have the last word, Siddaramaiah tweeted back and taking a dig at information and broadcasting minister Smriti Irani said: “And if you spread #FakeNews about our Anti-Superstition Law criminalising or demeaning Hindu traditions, I&B Minister Smriti Irani will hit you with her circular!”
