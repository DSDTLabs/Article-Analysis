Saligao: The general body meeting of the comunidade of Pilerne witnessed commotion over the disposal of a piece of land and alleged collusion between the former attorney and tenants. Gaunkars said the Pilerne comunidade sold the land to a builder and an individual person for a sum of Rs 4 crore. “In the memorandum of understanding signed between the comunidade, Jovita Nazareth and Balchandra Hadfadkar, the comunidade should have received Rs 2 crore, while Nazareth and Hadfadkar should have received Rs 1 crore each. But in the sale deed executed by the former attorney Cosmos Fernandes, it was written as Rs 1.5 crore, so why was Rs 50 lakh paid extra to Nazareth,” said de Souza, who was supported by gaunkar, Edgar Melo Furtado. Clarifying his stand on the issue, former attorney and current president of the comunidade Cosmos Fernandes said that the managing committee had granted approval to the same from the extracts of a managing committee meeting held on December 4, 2006. “I state that besides the above amounts totaling Rs 2 crore, no other amounts were received by me in the capacity of the attorney of the comunidade of Pilerne and the same is to the best of my knowledge and understanding,” said Fernandes.
