GURUGRAM: Six days into the  , 250 extension  , protesting across the district under the banner of  , refused to call off their   on Saturday. The agitating teachers said they were not satisfied with the government’s recent measure of raising the cap on their   from Rs 18,000 to Rs 25,000 as it would not benefit them. 

 Meanwhile, five government colleges in the city continue to face the aftermath of the protest. The agitation was called on February 13 against the state government for failing to implement the Punjab and Haryana high court’s decision, dated May 5 2016, that recommended reimbursement of salaries to extension lecturers as per University Grants Commission norms.
 
 In its attempt to mollify the protesting extension teachers, who are paid on ‘per-lecture basis’, the department of higher education on Friday rolled out new orders raising the cap on their monthly remuneration. However, lecturers who spoke to TOI said they are unlikely to draw any benefit from this.
 
 A lecturer from Government College, Sector 14, said, “We usually deliver four lectures in a day and for every lecture, we get paid Rs 250. This means we can earn up to Rs 1,000 in a day. Every month has arund 18-20 working days.Even if we work on all 20 days, which is unusual, we can earn Rs 20,000 so raising the cap to Rs 25,000 makes no sense.” 
 
 Lecturers alleged that Haryana has around 2,500 extension lecturers while the count of regular staff is nearly 1,800. “The extension lecturers constitute more than 50% of the workforce for the colleges in Gurgaon. They must increase the ceiling of the amount which is given to us for every lecture,” said another teacher, seeking anonymity.
