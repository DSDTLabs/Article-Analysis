DUBAI: The second-round clash between top-seeded   and the 97th-ranked Guillermo Garcia-Lopez was about a crucial factor in matchplay - confidence. Something one man had rediscovered and the other was still seeking. It was obvious that Murray , the world No.1, who hadn't taken off from where he had left off last year, struggling in Australia in the opening Grand Slam of the year, had finally regained the spring in his stride and the spark in his play, while the Spaniard still appeared awkward.

 Murray - who fell in the fourth round in Melbourne, has just recovered from a bout of shingles and is playing his first tournament in a month - lost just one point on his serve and eight in all in the second set, to score a convincing 6-2, 6-0 win. In the quarterfinals of the Dubai Duty Free   championships on Thursday the 29-year-old Scot will play German  , who beat Russia's Danil Medvedev 6-4, 6-4.
 
 The Scot said he was happy with his form. “It was way better than how I played at the beginning of the year that's for sure. Playing aggressive, feeling more solid. When I'm in a position to dictate the points, I'm doing it, moving forward,” he said. “I hit my forehand very well last couple of matches. I served better today. It's been a good start. Obviously matches will get tougher, but I'm much happier with how I'm playing.”
 
 In other second round affairs, Spain's   knocked out countryman, the sixth-seed Roberto Bautista Agut 6-4, 3-6, 7-5.
