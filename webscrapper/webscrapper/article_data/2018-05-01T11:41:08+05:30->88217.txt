PANAJI: The department of education has identified around 50 government primary   across the state which have fallen into disrepair and has asked   (GSIDC) to renovate the schools during the summer school break. 

 GSIDC is projected to spend Rs 15-18 crore on the repairs of the schools which are spread across all the 12 talukas of Goa.
 
 “In each taluka, after seeing the potential for the school, its future growth and its current condition, the education department has identified schools which GSIDC will renovate,” GSIDC vice-chairman Sidharth Kuncalienkar said. “There are 40-50 schools which are currently being renovated. Especially, the roof work, since we don’t want the roof to leak during the rains.”
