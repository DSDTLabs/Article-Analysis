NAGPUR: The Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (MCOCA) court has ordered Special Investigation Team (SIT) to seize 90.75 acre land, which is worth crores, allegedly acquired by force by Dilip   and his wife Shubhangi from various people. “The procedure of confiscating the illegally acquired land property would start from Monday,” said   (crime) Somnath Vaghchoure. 

 The ACP, who spearheaded the SIT along with DCP Sambhaji Kadam under the guidance of joint CP  , had produced the findings of investigation reports before the court and sought permission to seize the property under section 20(2) of MCOCA Act. After going through the documents, the court has ordered SIT to reclaim the property in the name of original buyers.
 
 Vaghchoure informed that after several offences had been registered against Gwalbanshi, SIT came to know that he had forcibly captured land across the city as well as in rural areas. He had registered many of his illegal properties in the name of his wife Shubhangi. Gwalbanshi and four others have also been charged under section 3 of MCOCA in a case of rioting and extortion registered at   police station on May 3. This case followed a complaint by a land owner at Tawakkal Layout in  .
 
 “As of now, the documents of 90.75 acre have been verified. However, there are still a number of land documents which would be verified soon. Following the complaints registered, SIT came to know that apart from this 90.75 acre land, the couple fraudulently possesses another 30 acre land property,” Vaghchoure told TOI.
 
 He added that the procedure of confiscating the property would be conducted in two phases. From Monday, the phase I of reclaiming 90.75 acre land would be started, which would be soon followed by seizing the rest 30 acre land.
 
 He also said that the court has also asked Gwalbanshi to submit his explanation on how he came to own this land, by September 29. However, this action would not stop the seizure of the land by SIT.
