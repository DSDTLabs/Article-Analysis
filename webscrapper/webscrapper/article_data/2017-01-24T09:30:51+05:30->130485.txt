KOLHAPUR: City-based builders have requested the state government to increase the height of new buildings, much in the lines of the permission granted in Pune. 

 The developers want the building height to be increased from existing 16 metre to 24 metre. The demand has been made considering the new rules set by the government in September last year.
 
 As per the rules, the developers have to set aside 6 metre open space on the sides of the building. Considering the small plots available in Kolhapur, builders claim that this has led to crunching the space for actual construction further.
 
 Since leaving the space in front or on the rear side is mandatory for disaster mitigation, the developers had demanded that only the buildings higher than 24metre be considered as high rise. The state government has listed separate rules for high-rise buildings related to fire, parking, tenement size and open spaces. 
 
  president   said, “The government has increased the height for buildings in Pune by lowering the parking height. We have demanded that similar decision should be taken for the buildings in the city so that the issue of space crunch can be addressed properly.” 
 
 He added, “We have maintained that the permissions to the buildings with height less than 24 metre can be given after scrutinising all the disaster-related issues such as provisions to be made in the building to stop the fire in case of disaster.”
 
 The developers have briefed the officials of the urban development department regarding the measures being undertaken by the   ( ) to address any disasters in the high-rise buildings. 
 
 For the construction of high rises, the roads surrounding the layout should be 12 metre wide. The KMC officials have requested the government to reduce the road width to 9 metre since there are very few roads with 12 metre size in the city.
