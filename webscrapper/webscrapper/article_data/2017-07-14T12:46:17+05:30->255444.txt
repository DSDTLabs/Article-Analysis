CHANDRAPUR:   state vice-president and former minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Thursday slammed loan waiver announced by the state government terming it as “deceptive” and “misleading”.

 He charged that regulations laid are so harsh that no more than 30% farmers will be able to avail waiver benefits. “Its severity could be understood by the fact that only 1,082 of the total 1.36 crore farmers in the state could avail the advance benefit of Rs 10,000 announced by the government for Kharif sowing,” he said.
 
 “To expose the hallow announcement of the government, Congress has launched ‘majhi karjmafi zali nahi’ (my Loan has not been waived) agitation across the state. The district unit of Congress will distribute 1 lakh printed forms among the farmers and seek details of status of waiver from them. These forms will be collected from the farmers during a ‘rath yatra’ that will be taken out in the district. Later, the list of deprived farmers will be given to guardian minister Sudhir Mungantiwar,” he said.
 
 Wadettiwar said even after three weeks of announcement, not a single farmer has received any benefit of waiver. He demanded that the government should extend the benefit period of scheme up to June 2017 and include all kind of loans for various supplementary business, purchase of farming tools, digging of farm pond or well etc.
 
 He also slammed chief minister   for his announcement about building modern weather monitoring stations in every district.
 
 The MLA said the CM has taken no initiative towards building a single weather station in the state even after three years.
 
 He claimed that   is again facing a drought-like situation.
