After enthralling the audience with his seamless performance as the footballer VP Sathyan, actor   has been ushering in new beginnings and has already started working on his next project. 

 He would be teaming up next with his friend and director   for Njan Marykutty, and like always, the duo will be treating another subject that is of social relevance, through the film. 
 
 The latest news is that the team have started shooting for the film, about which both Jayasurya and Ranjith Sankar divulged on social media. The film is being shot at Muvattupuzha on March 17, the same location where Ranjith Sankar’s journey as a director began. 
 
 He posted, “Starting Njan Marykutty today at Muvattupuzha in the same location I came to narrate Passenger script to mammukka . It was 2006 and he was shooting Palunku .First time I ever saw a movie set..He loved the script and asked me whom I wanted to direct it.I said only I can direct it.Mammukka laughed and said you can direct. Had he said otherwise I would have never become a director.Attempting my 10th film now. Life indeed comes a full circle. Thanx mammukka 🙏 (sic).”
 
 Though not much is known about the film’s storyline, reports suggest that it has some implications to a transgender’s life. But for now, to know more about it, we have to wait for some more time.
