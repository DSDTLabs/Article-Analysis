AHMEDABAD: Thousands of people thronged   on Thursday as devotees ushered in ‘Mahashtami’ or Durga Ashtami – the most auspicious day of Durga Puja, with   – offering flowers to the goddess Durga. Beautifully crafted idols of the goddess were adorned with fine jewellery and flowers at the various pandals set up in Ahmedabad by the Bengali community here.

 While   is no less than a carnival for the Bengali community, scores of devotees from all communities flocked to the pandals for the festivities, prayers and to enjoy the delicious bhog.
 
 “We make it a point to enjoy the Sandhi Puja, which is performed on the evening of Mahashtami and Navmi, where we offer a saree, flowers, sweets and dakshina to the goddess. As my son is working in Kolkata, I miss being there as Puja festivities are very different there. However, it is always a joy to be part of the community gatherings around Durga Puja,” said Ashoka Chatterjee, a resident of Bodakdev.
 
 “The event is funded by ONGC and the pandals are always open not just for the Bengali community but also for others from the neighbourhood. We served the traditional bhog prasad to some 3,000 devotees,” said Goutam Lahiri, assistant secretary, Chandkheda Bengal Cultural Association.
 
 “I’ve been in Ahmedabad for 37 years and many Bengalis live in Gujarat. We organize cultural programmes – musical events and plays – so that our children stay in touch with the language and other elements of Bengali culture,” said Jyoti Basu, a resident of Maninagar.
