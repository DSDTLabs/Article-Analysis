NEW DELHI:   accused the   government of doing “double-speak” on allowing 100%   in single brand retail while attacking the Centre for relaxing the 30% outsourcing clause. AICC spokesman   said that 100% FDI in single brand retail was notified during the previous UPA government and the only change made is to allow it through the automatic route.

 “The Prime Minister talks of ‘Make in India’, but now says local sourcing is not required,” Sharma said, asking the government to clarify its policy on multi-brand retail. He also said the policy on multi-brand retail enumerated by the previous UPA government stands and has not been reversed. He asked the government to clarify on its policy.
 
 “As the BJP government allows 100% FDI in single brand retail by doing away the requirement of 30% sourcing through ‘Make in India’, the PM and FM’s duplicity and doublespeak stand exposed,” he said.Congress spokesman R P N Singh said when the BJP was in the opposition, they had opposed the UPA government’s decision. Now when they are in power, they have even dispensed with the 30% sourcing clause while allowing FDI in retail sector.
 
 CPM too opposed the FDI retail decision. Referring to the government’s move as a U-turn on the BJP’s stated position when it was in opposition, CPM general secretary   said, “The BJP, while in opposition, was opposed to the entry of foreign companies into retail trade. Now being in government, it has hypocritically reversed its position.”
