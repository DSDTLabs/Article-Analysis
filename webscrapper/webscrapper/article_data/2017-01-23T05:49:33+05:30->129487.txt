AHMEDABAD: Relatives of a learning-impaired  , who is presently under treatment at  , have told cops that the girl had accompanied her mother to a   located near Mehsana, and from there she had gone missing.

 The state government on Saturday had ordered an inquiry into the laxities shown by different NGOs in dealing with the plight of the rape survivor minor. Senior police sources said the girl’s father and one of her close relatives, who are being questioned, have said the girl herself had declined to return from a religious place and hence her mother left her there before returning.
 
 “Her father told us that the girl often used to leave the house and return later. They thought she would return later and hence did not lodge a missing persons report,” said a senior police official. Investigators said the girl had earlier told them in gestures that five persons had raped her. “The girl claims she knows these five, and hence we have launched a manhunt to nab them in Palanpur and Deesa,” added a police source.
 
 Meanwhile, cops are also verifying the details narrated by the father and relative of the girl about the girl going missing from a religious place. “We are checking the cellphone location of the girl’s mother at the time she is said to have visited the religious place to cure her daughter,” said a cop. Police sources said the injuries caused on the private parts of the girl seem to be caused by insertion of some foreign object. “We are awaiting medical opinion,” said an investigator. The girl was found by Childline on December 28 and was admitted to Civil Hospital. “Civil Hospital authorities said the girl had escaped and was found by Mahenoor Saiyed,” said a police official. The girl was then shunted from one NGO to another.
