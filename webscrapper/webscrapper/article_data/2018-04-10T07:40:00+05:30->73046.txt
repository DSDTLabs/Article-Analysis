CHANDIGARH: Delay in payment of the monthly   of Rs 200 will invite interest for the employer and individual payee alike. What’s more, both willful non-payment of the tax or even due to a reasonable cause will also invite penalty for the employer or an individual liable to pay the tax.

 As per the plan, the tax will be collected from   payees having monthly income of Rs 30,000 per month or above. The amount of penalty, which can go up to 50% of the total tax due, will be awarded by the designated officer.
 
 “The penalty would be Rs 5,000 for employer or payee deliberately giving false information and it would be 50% if the payment of any amount of tax is not made within the required time frame. However, the penalty would be Rs 50 per day if the registered employer or enrolled person fails to file the return,” said an official.
 
 If any employer or a payee fails to deduct the tax at the time of payment of salary, he will be liable to pay simple interest at 2% of the amount of tax due for each month.
 
 Since other modalities pertaining to the tax are still being worked out, there are doubts galore. “There is still no clarity on whether the taxable income of Rs 30,000 will be calculated after rebates,” said  , an excise and taxation lawyer.
 
 “Besides, there should also be clarity about people like me who live in Punjab work but elsewhere. In my case I work in Baddi but have a house in New Chandigarh,” added Bharat Passey, an engineer.
 
 The bill for introducing the tax has been recently passed in the   with an aim to provide “high priority on utilization of tax receipts in different welfare scheme and developmental works”.
 
 The tax will be collected from professionals and traders and dearness allowance and other remunerations will also be considered. By bringing in the new tax, the state government hopes to raise Rs 1,500 crore during the current financial year.
