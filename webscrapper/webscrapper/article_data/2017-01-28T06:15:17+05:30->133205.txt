PUNE: A 45-year-old woman was arrested on Friday, a day after she allegedly   dispute near   in Ambegaon Budruk.

 The woman running a stone crushing business had parked her car behind two-wheelers for buying a SIM card from a shop around 7.45pm on Thursday. “The parked car stalled traffic movement on the narrow road near the chowkey. When the woman was asked to remove her vehicle, she confronted the beat marshals,” said assistant inspector   of the   police station on Friday.
 
 He said, “The woman initially refused to follow the instruction of the marshals. She lost her cool after one of them told her that a case for obstructing traffic could be registered against her if she did not remove the car and she would have to deposit fine in the magisterial court. Instead of paying heed to the warning, she misbehaved with the policemen, abused them and refused to remove the car.”
 
 He said, “A woman cop brought the businesswoman to the chowkey and tried to pacify her. The cop advised her not to indulge in double parking because it created traffic snarls. But the woman was in a bad mood and hurled abuses at six policemen, saying ‘your value is of Rs100 and I shall teach you all a lesson’.”
 
 Madane said, “On hearing commotion, the woman’s driver rushed to the spot and removed the car on cops’ request and we cleared the traffic congestion. The woman later told the police that she had misbehaved with the cops in a fit of anger, but refused to tender an apology,” Madane said.
 
 A complaint under Section 353 (attack or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging duty) of IPC was registered against her besides other charges. The arrested woman would be produced before the court on Saturday.
