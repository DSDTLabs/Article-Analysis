Visakhapatnam: Seven persons, including four from Gajuwaka area of the city, were injured — six of them seriously — in a fire mishap that took place in a tyre recycling unit at   village, in Anakapalli rural area on Tuesday. Most of the injured are teenagers.

 The injured were identified as 19-year-old Mandapaka Kumar, Kosama Srinu (18), Maridipaka Kumar (19) and V Govind (24), all from Old Gajuwaka. The other three are Kona Madhu (19), S Srinu (21) and   (24) of Rebaka village. While Ganesh received minor injuries, the remaining six have been admitted at the KGH burns ward where their condition is said to be serious.
 
 According to cops, the fire happened in the afternoon at Lalitambika Industries Private Limited. Three workers of the unit and four welding workers who came from Gajuwaka were at the unit during the time of the mishap. The workers were separating carbon, iron and other material from the used tyres. The recycled tyres were to be put in a boiler or reactor (a cylindrical-shaped compartment).
 
 While the process was on and the workers were removing the leftover material, the boiler door reportedly got jammed. They tried to open the container door on their own but when they didn’t succeed in opening the manhole-type door, they took the services of the welding workers from Gajuwaka who were erecting a shed in the area. They tried to cut the door with a cutter which generated sparks, resulting in a big blast. The fire engulfed the area within seconds. All the seven persons got trapped inside the shed.
