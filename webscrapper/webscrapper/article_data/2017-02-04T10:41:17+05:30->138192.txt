LUCKNOW: Springing a surprise, Lok Dal announced on Friday that   patriarch   will be its one of the star campaigners for the assembly elections. Confirming this to TOI, Lok Dal president Sunil Singh said a letter in this regard has been sent to the Election Commission.

 “Netaji’s (Mulayam Singh Yadav) name is at the top in the list of 15 campaigners sent to the EC,” Singh told TOI. Other star campaigners would be actors Manisha Koirala, Ehsan Khan, Rajpal Yadav and Makrand Deshpande, he added.
 
 The names of Lok Dal president Sunil Singh and state unit president SP Singh Kushwaha, too, are in the list.
 
 Asked if naming Mulayam as a star campaigner would be legally and constitutionally valid since he is not a primary member of Lok Dal, Singh said, “I have invited Netaji in my personal capacity to give his blessings and he need not be a primary member of Lok Dal to be a star campaigner for our party.” He added that even the actors named by Lok Dal are not its primary members, yet they will campaign for the party. Rajpal Yadav has, in fact, floated his party -- Sarva Sambhav Party.
 
 Singh said in EC’s records, Lok Dal is a registered, unrecognised party formed by former PM Charan Singh in 1980. “Netaji was its founder member. I have offered Lok Dal’s symbol and national president’s post to Netaji, who is still our leader,” he said.
 
 Lok Dal has short-listed 100 candidates for UP elections.
