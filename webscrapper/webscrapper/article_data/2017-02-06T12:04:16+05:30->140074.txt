KENDRAPADA: Panchayat election candidates in the coastal districts of Kendrapada and Jagatsinghpur have added technology to their campaign efforts in close mimicry of what is now a common poll practice in big cities. 

 "I have already sent SMSes to more than 2,000 voters with the simple message that reads, 'For better development of our villages, I need your support and vote'," said Ganesh Samal, a   candidate of Zilla Parishad zone 26 in Kendrapada district.
 
 However, use of phones to reach out to people in villages has also thrown som e of their condition into harsh perspective. 
 
 "Large numbers of rural women, illiterate and semi-literate people have no mobile phones. We have tried to approach them directly in their houses as modern communication technology is useless for them," said Bijaya Jena, a sarpanch candidate in the Rajagada gram panchayat. 
 
  Many candidates have also been sending texts to their supporters to notify them about the time and date of their meetings. 
 
 "We have been sending messages on meetings, rural development works, one rupee rice scheme and other work done by the BJD government," said Dhiren Sahoo, a senior BJD leader and the chairman of Kendrapada municipality.
 
 With repeated texts come their inevitable follow up - a great deal of annoyance on the part of the receiver. 
 
 "I spend around 30 minutes each day deleting the messages I receive," said Nagendra Jena, a voter of Karilopatana gram panchayat.
