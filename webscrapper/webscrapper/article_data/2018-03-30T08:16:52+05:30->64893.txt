Has prohibition led to a spurt in consumption of drugs in Bihar? The data on narcotics seized by various agencies suggests this may be the case.   reported the highest increase in seizures of opium and hashish among all states between 2015 and 2017 and was next only to   when it came to ganja. There was also a significant increase in seizures of heroin in the state.

 In 2017, police seized 28,888kg of illicit ganja in Bihar, which was more than 2,000 times the 14.4kg that had been impounded in 2015. Similarly, seizure of 329kg of opium last year was 167 times the seizure in 2015, the year that preceded the state government’s liquor ban, which came into force on October 2, 2016. The state seized 244kg of hashish in 2017 while it had not seen a single seizure of this drug in 2015.
 
  
  
 
 
 In terms of the percentage increase in seizures of heroin, Bihar again is among the highest, though the quantities involved remain small, as they do in a majority of states.
 
 Data revealed recently in response to a question in the Lok Sabha shows that in terms of the quantity of confiscated ganja, Andhra Pradesh topped the list with about 79,000kg. It was followed by Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, but the increase in these three states between 2015 and 2017 was much lower than in Bihar. Similarly, Punjab, Rajasthan and   reported higher quantities of seized opium than Bihar, but they couldn’t match the scale of the increase in seizures.
 
 In 2015, Bihar did not report a single seizure of hashish. In 2017, it seized about 244kgs and was one among six states reporting the impounding of more than 200kg of the drug, which is also derived from the cannabis plant. UP reported the highest seizures of hashish followed by MP, Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.
 
 Only eight states reported the seizure of more than 50kg of heroin. Among them,   reported the highest. Interestingly, Punjab and Delhi reported a decrease in 2017 as compared to 2015.
 
 The data also shows that in many states there has been a significant increase in seizures of codeine-based cough syrups (CBCS). Delhi reported the seizure of 1.4 lakh bottles of this intoxicant. Tripura and   also reported the seizure of more than a lakh bottles each. Interestingly, in 2017, Bihar did not register a single case of CBCS seizure though in 2015 police had confiscated more than 58,000 bottles in the state.
 
 Analysing long-term trends in seizures of ganja, opium, heroin and hashish, an indicator of the prevalence of these drugs, shows that ganja consumption has increased significantly in the country. Between 1999 and 2017, the average of seizures is 1.36 lakh kg a year. Between 2004 and 2015, the seizures were close to this average, but there has been a sharp uptick in the last two years, touching almost 3 lakh kg in 2016 and crossing 3.5 lakh kg in 2017. Over the long term, heroin seizures too have increased significantly, those of opium have remained stable while hashish seizures have dipped.
