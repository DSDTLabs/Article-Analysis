MYSURU: Reiterating that he’ll contest from  , chief minister   on Friday said there was pressure on him from a section of party workers to contest from a   constituency as it would strengthen the party’s base. He, however, didn’t disclose the name of the constituency.

 “I’ve made it clear I’ll try my luck only from Chamundeshwari that gave me political birth,” said Siddaramaiah addressing cheering Vokkaligas from the constituency. “It’s all propaganda that Siddaramaiah will contest from another constituency because he fears losing the fight,” he said.
 
 About allegations that Siddaramaiah is anti-Vokkaliga, he said it’s far from the truth. “I’ve given benefits to all sections of the society through various schemes without any discrimination. Despite treating all community members equally, I’ve been branded as anti-Vokkaliga,” he said.
 
 Siddaramaiah revised his estimate for JD(S), saying it could win 30 seats from the earlier 25.
