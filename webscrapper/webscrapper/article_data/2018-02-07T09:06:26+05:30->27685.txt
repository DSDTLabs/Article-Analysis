BATHINDA: Irked over   (PSPCL) paying no heed to their demand of accommodating them in different jobs as promised earlier, contractual workers of the closed-down Guru Nanak Dev thermal plant (GNDTP), Bathinda, on Tuesday formed three different teams to hold protests at different places in   and nearby Bhucho village.

 The team that went to Bhucho apprised the villagers about the policies of the state government towards poor people and mobilized masses to offer them support.
 
 The team also collected ration to feed the families of the protesters sitting on protest for weeks. Other teams of GNDTP contractual workers carried out protest marches holding black flags in Bathinda on different routes.
 
 The contractual workers of the thermal plant are sitting on a protest with their family members since January 1 when the plant was shut down. “The PSPCL management though has assured to adjust us in the corporation on contract-based jobs in a meeting on January 27, till now it has not made any written agreement. After waiting for the outcome for many days, we have revised our protest mode. We have decided to form different teams daily to stage protests at different places to mount pressure on the government to concede to our demands and restarting the thermal plant,” said GNDTP contract workers’ coordination committee convener  .
 
 On the other hand, GNDTP general manager   said, “The management is working out plan to adjust the contractual employees within the PSPCL. It will be decided soon in a board meeting and no worker will be retrenched.”
