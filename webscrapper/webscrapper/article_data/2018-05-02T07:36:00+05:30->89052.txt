Bathinda: A group of students of the Central University of Punjab (CUP), Bathinda, alleging fear of victimisation at the hands of the university authorities for leading a protest after the death of a fellow student, Sushant Sagar, on the night of April 23, handed over a memorandum to the Bathinda DC on Tuesday.

 The students, who are members of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Student Organisation, alleged that the university authorities were threatening them not to raise the issue of negligence in the death of Sushant. A student of MSc-II in biochemistry and microbial science, Sushant had collapsed while playing basketball on the evening of April 23 and nearly half an hour was wasted in taking him to a private hospital, where he was declared brought dead.
 
 Student activists Gagan Sharma and Amandeep Singh, who are pursuing doctorate in biosciences, along with others, said the university authorities were keeping a vigil on their activities. “We fear some professional loss as a lot of powers are vested with the authorities,” feared Gagan. They said earlier also there had been some instances of medical negligence in the university, so the health issues should be dealt with seriously and there should be complete infrastructure on the campus.
 
 The students said they handed over a memorandum to the DC and demanded a scholarship after Sushant, who had bagged the best student award in February. “We also want a basketball court to be named after him and his family should be duly compensated. The university should also fix responsibility for negligence on part of anybody,” said Amandeep.
 
 University VC R K Kohli denied threats to any student and said a committee had already been constituted to look into the issue of negligence in the death of Sushant. Bathinda DC Diprava Lakra said that, “CUP students have given a representation, outlining various demands and I will take up the matter with the university authorities.”
