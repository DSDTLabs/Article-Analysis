AHMEDABAD: Naseer Memon (name changed), a resident of Mumbai, was surprised when he was stopped by the immigration department at the Delhi international airport in December last year because he had a valid passport and a visa to travel to Canada. “His passport and those of his wife and son were put on a look-out circular by the Bureau of Immigration,” said an official of the city SOG. “The reason: their passports were used to travel to Canada three times — on August 29, September 30, and October 24 in 2016. Neither he nor his family had travelled on those occasions. He told officials that the passports were with his agent in Mumbai at those periods.”

 The revelation exposed the organized   racket. Passport details of the Memon family and their valid visas were used by agents to send illegal immigrants abroad. SOG has registered a complaint after the arrest of Bipinchandra Patel, an agent from Kadi, on Monday. “From the investigation, we believe that the agent had approached Patel who chose persons matching the age group of the victims,” said the official. “He forged the passports while keeping the details the same and changing the photographs. However, those who travelled to Canada on those passports had to return them to Patel so that he could use them again.” SOG sources said the passport details were sent to Malaysia to be put on to the forged passports. 
 
 Sources said that the families of Alpesh Patel, Mahesh Patel, and Mitesh Patel had used Pathani suits and burqas while travelling to play their part. “Bipinchandra Patel has claimed that it was difficult to get a visa with the surname and thus forged papers were used,” a source said.
 
 “At the airport immigration, there was a man, at the moment identified as Shetty, who facilitated the process,” said the official. “Investigation is on to ascertain how many persons are involved in the racket.”
