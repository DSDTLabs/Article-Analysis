PUNE: The Faraskhana police on Wednesday arrested three women and a director of an   in Saswad for trying to sell a new born baby boy to a childless couple. One of the arrested woman is the mother of the baby.

 The child’s mother, a   in Dombivli in Thane district, claimed that the baby was born out of an illicit relationship. 
 
 The police suspect that the other two women — one from   and the other from Khadakwasla — were running a surrogacy racket. The women had plans to sell the baby for Rs 3 lakh with the help of orphanage director, Keshav Dhende (42).
 
 Acting on a tip-off received by police constable Shankar Kumbhar, a police team led by senior inspector Rekha Salunke laid a trap and nabbed the suspects. 
 
 Assistant inspector Mahendra Jadhav said, “The woman from Khadakwasla used to be on the lookout for women who had become pregnant out of illicit relationship and wanted to get rid of the baby. The woman from Ulhasnagar after coming to know that her bar dancer friend had delivered the baby, introduced her to the woman from Khadakwasla, who had promised to help her.
 
 Jadhav said the Khadakwasla woman, then, informed about the baby to her acquaintance Dhende. “Dhende, in turn, told them about a childless couple who wanted to buy a baby and that they were ready to pay Rs 3 lakh for it,” Jadhav said, adding, “We arrested them before they could hand over the baby.”
 
 A city court remanded the suspects in police custody till January 9. “We are suspecting involvement of more persons in the racket. Our probe is on,” Jadhav said.
