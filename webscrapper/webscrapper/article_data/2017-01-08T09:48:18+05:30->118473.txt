NAGPUR: In the forthcoming municipal elections, every polling booth will have 750-800 voters as against earlier norm of 1,000 voters per booth. The updated  , which has been finalized, also includes 50,970 new voters in the city.

 The state   had sent a letter to   (NMC), directing it to plan polling booths for 750-800 voters each. Accordingly, the civic body is planning the polling booths and locations. In 2012 municipal elections, there were 2,487 polling booths. With change in norms, the number of polling booths will increase to around 2,800.
 
 NMC officials told TOI the revision has been done for the convenience of voters. “Number of voters has also increased, so has the area of the city. The latest decision will help voters to find polling booths closer to their residences,” he said.
 
 In fact, NMC had been planning to go in for around 3,000 polling booths with 600 voters per booth. However, NMC will now have to follow the state election commission directives.
 
 NMC and district administration had conducted a drive to register new voters between September 16 and October 14. The district administration has finalized the new voters list and sent it to NMC.
 
 As per this list, total number of new voters is 50,970. Earlier, the number of voters was 20,46,705. Now, the total number of voters has increased to 20,97,675. NMC has already completed the break-up of old voters as per new ward system. Now, break-up of new voters will also be done.
 
 Notification of voters list will be issued on January 12. Suggestions and objections will be accepted on or before January 17. Then final voters list will be published on January 21.
 
 In 2007 municipal elections, total numbers of voters was 14,44,079 and the number was 19,86,057 in 2012 municipal elections.
 
 The voters, excluding new ones, can check their names and ward on www.nmcelection2017.org or localbodyvoterlist.maharashtra.gov.in.
 
 The code of conduct is expected to be enforced anytime now, with the official announcement by the state election commissioner expected on Monday.
