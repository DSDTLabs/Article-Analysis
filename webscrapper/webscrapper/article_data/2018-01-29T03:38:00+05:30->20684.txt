Margao: The issue of double tracking of the railway route passing through the village and the carbon dust pollution dominated the proceedings of the   Jose de Areal gram sabha on Sunday. 

 Trouble began when villagers began questioning the sarpanch, Pires D’Costa, over the plan of the double tracking of the railways that was placed at the meeting. When pointed out that the plan carried no stamp or signature of the issuing authority, nor had any inward details of the panchayat, Pires failed to provide satisfactory replies that further agitated the villagers. Terming the plan as “fake” and a fraud on the villagers, the gram sabha members tore up the plan and demanded that the panchayat come clean on the issue.
 
 Gram sabha members demanded that the local MLA, Filipe Neri Rodrigues, who was present in the meeting, object to the land acquisition for the railway project in the next assembly session.
 
 On the issue of the carbon dust pollution in the village from an industrial unit, D’Costa informed the gram sabha about the plans of the firm of installing a machine to reduce pollution. Villagers demanded that a demonstration of the machinery be held at a gram sabha before its installation in the industrial unit.
 
 Gram sabha member Peter Viegas moved a resolution to erect the statue of Jack De Sequeira with the demand that the local MLA vote in favour of any bill moved in the assembly in that regard. The resolution was passed unanimously.
