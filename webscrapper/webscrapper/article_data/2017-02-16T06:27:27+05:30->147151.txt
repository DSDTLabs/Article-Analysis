AHMEDABAD: Head constable Mahendrasinh Sisodia and constable Kunjan Patel, and their informer Hardik Ranjan had   a   of Rs 47 lakh in   notes. 

 They did not anticipate that the person who promised to exchange the old notes with new currency would betray them the way they double-crossed Jaideep Patel and robbed the old notes from his wife.
 
 Crime branch officials said that the person who has fled with the notes hails from Vadodara and is now reportedly hiding in Mumbai. “We have dispatched a team to nab him,” said a senior crime branch official.
 
 Police sources said Pankaj Soni, a resident of Rudra Square on Judges Bungalow Road and Umesh Patel of   — both estate agents — and  , a trader in mobile phone accessories, had given Rs 20 lakh, Rs 10 lakh and Rs 5 lakh in old currency notes to Suchit Shah who turned to Jaideep Patel to get the notes exchanged.
 
 Jaideep had roped in Bharat Vyas and Sujal Shah for the job. Shah and Vyas were to give the notes to Hardik Ranjan, a civil engineer who had dealings with Sisodia and Kunjan Patel.
 
 On February 3, based on Ranjan’s tip-off, Sisodia and Kunjan Patel intercepted Jaideep’s wife Mittal near RTO Circle while she was on her way to Shahibaug to exchange the notes. The two cops fled with bag containing the notes.
 
 Enraged by the developments, Jignesh Pandya and the other three summoned Suchit and Jaideep to an office on CG Road and confined them there. However, on the complaint from Jaideep’s wife, police released the two and arrested seven persons for kidnapping.
 
 “Meanwhile Sisodia and Ranjan went to the person from Vadodara who had promised to get the notes exchanged,” said a crime branch official. “The man told them to come after three days. However, he fled with the notes.”
 
 Crime branch officials said they have identified the man. “Greed has landed Sisodia and Patel in a police lock-up,” said a senior crime branch official.
