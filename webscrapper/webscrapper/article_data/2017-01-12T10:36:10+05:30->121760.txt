BENGALURU: Led by Bengaluru, office space lease activity rose last year to breach the 40 million-sq ft mark in the country. Much of the demand came from the IT and ITeS sectors and financial services companies in leading cities in India, independent property consultancy CBRE said.

 Gross space absorption rose 9 per cent to about 43 million sqft in 2016, compared to the previous year. About 13.9 million sq ft of space was leased in the quarter ended December, an increase of 20 per cent sequentially.
 
 Leasing during the year was led by Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR, the two together accounting for about 50% of the total. Bengaluru did 11.6 million sqft and Delhi 8.6 million sqft of office space activity .The two were followed by Pune and Mumbai. Hyderabad witnessed a steep rise in occupier demand, with absorption more than doubling to cross 6 million sq ft.
 
 â€œCommercial activity and occupier demand is expected to remain steady in the coming months, backed by corporates looking to expand consolidate operations. Regulatory clearances in key locations are also likely to boost leasing activity in the coming quarters," Ram Chandnani, managing director of CBRE South Asia said.
 
 As for new supply in the last quarter, Bengaluru led the race with about 48%, followed by Mumbai at 16% and Delhi NCR and Hyderabad at 10% each. Bengaluru had supply completions post the much awaited regulatory clearances during the quarter, resulting in a release of significant builtup supply . That is expected to boost leasing activity in Bengaluru which, in spite of robust demand, has seen a dearth of supply of Grade ` A' office space.ORR has a vacancy rate between 2-4%, and Whitefield about 8%, compared to the national average of about 13%.
