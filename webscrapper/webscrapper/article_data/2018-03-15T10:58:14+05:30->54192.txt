HYDERABAD: Legislative affairs minister  , who himself was at the centre of a controversy when he created a ruckus in the   during the   movement, was giving ‘gyan’ on how legislators should conduct themselves in the House and claimed that article 194(3) of the Constitution gave enough powers to legislatures to punish a member found guilty of breach of privilege or contempt of the House.

 Reacting to the ‘missile attack’ on Swamy Goud, he said, “He ( ) was on record on his plan to hurl the headphones at the governor. It was telecast by all channels. The statement is enough to take stringent action against him.” He said Telangana’s image could have taken a beating had the headphones landed on the governor. “We will not allow such incidents in Telangana,” he said and ruled out review of the issue as the Assembly had already notified the vacancy of the two Assembly seats.
 
 When asked if the action of the legislature would stand legal scrutiny, the minister recalled the MP High Court’s judgment in 1967 wherein it upheld the ruling of Assembly to expel legislator   for his behaviour. “Telangana Assembly has only exercised its right to protect itself from uncivilised behaviour of a legislator,” said Harish.
