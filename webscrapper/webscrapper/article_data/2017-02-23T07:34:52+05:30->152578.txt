THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: More than a fortnight after the   gave instructions to suspend classes at the controversial  , the institution has resumed classes on Wednesday, after obtaining favourable orders from the high court. 

 It was on February 6 that the university vice chancellor asked the college authorities to suspend classes after a section of students began an agitation against the college management over its misconduct to students. 
 
 The college made it into the headlines after students, especially girl students, raised allegations of harassment against the college management. On February 2, the university executive committee decided not to extend the affiliation of the college in the next academic year. The decision was taken based on two inquiry reports that found irregularities in the conduct of the college. 
 
 The executive committee decided to forward its decision to the   (AICTE). However, the AICTE has not yet responded to the request for readmitting the students, especially chemical engineering students, to other colleges. Meanwhile, a section of students, mainly those who pursue chemical engineering, have staged a dharma in front of the secretariat on Wednesday, demanding that they be shifted to other engineering colleges. Currently, the Cochin Institute of Science and Technology and Amal Jyothi College of Engineering-two other self-financing engineering colleges offer the course. But to shift the students AICTE's sanction is needed. 
 
 Sources said a section of the students have approached the university with the demand for continuing their studies at the   itself. If any of the students makes such a demand, the university will have no option but to allow the college to conduct classes.
