INDORE: Calling two men to their house to repair the lock of an almirah proved dear for a family as the men allegedly tricked them and made away with cash and jewellery worth Rs 26,000. They also tried to kidnap a four-year-old girl. The incident took place on Sunday afternoon around 1:30 pm.

 The complainant, Hanuman Dewde, a resident of   who works as a driver, was out for some work when the incident took place.
 
 He said the lock was giving some problem so his wife, Usha, called two men who were roaming around the colony to repair it. The men, both in turbans, kept struggling for a while and later said the lock had been repaired. The duo also took Rs 200 as labour charges before they escaped. A few minutes later, Usha noticed her four-year-old daughter   was missing.
