  Siddiqui said since many weddings take place at his banquet hall and a lot of uneaten stuff is wasted, it can be used to feed the needy. Locals can also approach the bank to give extra food, he said.
  
  On Saturday, Bijnor district magistrate Jagat Raj Tripathi inaugurated the roti bank at Muskaan banquet hall on Chandpur road. “This will really help the poor and the needy. It will also solve the problem of wastage of food,” said the DM. Tripathi also urged the people to save food and donate it to the bank so that the underprivileged can be fed.
  
  “I own a banquet hall on Chandpur road. For several years, I have been observing that a lot of food is wasted in marriages, parties and during festivals, but it does not reach the poor. It struck me that I should start a roti bank so that this food can be saved and properly utilized. I contacted some social workers and the district magistrate and discussed the idea with them. The response that I received was overwhelming and I just went ahead with the plan,” Siddiqui told TOI.
  He added that a detailed awareness plan to sensitize people against wasting food is in the pipeline. “Our aim is to collect food from different families, marriage parties and other sources. Several people have come forward and have volunteered to donate food.”
  
  Siddiqui has set up two counters in the bank — one for receiving food and the other for its distribution. “We have prepared a list of 1200 people who will be provided this food so that they do not go to sleep with an empty stomach. We have also made a plan to send food to the blind and physically challenged who cannot come to our bank,” he said.
