GUWAHATI: On  ,   (Metro)   inaugurated   on the banks of the Dighalipukhuri here. 

 On Monday, 13 such boxes were installed in a tree located on the bank of Dighalipukhuri, in front of Handique Girls College. The initiative was undertaken in collaboration with Help Earth, an NGO, to draw the attention of the youths to the need for conservation.
 
 "The need to protect urban biodiversity was the focal point on the occasion, with a special emphasis on birds. With rapid deforestation, birds are fast losing their homes. To add to this, as RCC buildings replace our age-old   type houses, sparrows and other birds fail to find the nooks and corners they were used to. Until we voluntarily provide living spaces for our feathered friends, their stay in our localities will be very short-lived," Angamuthu said.
 
 He encouraged the citizens of Guwahati to take steps to protect and conserve plants and animals around them. "Guwahati has the potential to become a model city for India in terms of urban biodiversity conservation with its wide range of habitat types along with its geographic position," added Angamuthu.
 
 Jayaditya Purkayastha, general secretary of Help Earth, said the involvement of people and awareness generation are important to attaining that feat. 
 
 Prior to this, Purkayastha had distributed more than 200 such boxes among the citizens to install in their houses. "This is very less seeing the volume of the city. So far, it has yielded overwhelming results. In this regard, I would like to thank our DC for being so helpful towards the conservation of urban biodiversity," he added.
