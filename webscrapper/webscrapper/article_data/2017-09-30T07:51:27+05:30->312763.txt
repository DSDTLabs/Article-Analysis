GURDASPUR: The rape case against senior   leader Sucha Singh Langah has given a major jolt to SAD-BJP’s campaign for the Lok Sabha bypoll in Gurdaspur. While Akalis are questioning the timing of registration of case against senior party leader, the Congress has sought the intervention of Akal Takht jathedar.

 “It is highly deplorable that the SAD(B) leader is involved in such a disgraceful act,” said cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi. He appealed to the Akal Takht jathedar to intervene in the matter. Congress MLA Inderbir   said former CM   should clarify his party’s stand after the registration of case, saying, “Langah was not only a minister in the Akali government but also a contender for the SGPC president’s post.”
 
 Terming it as Langah’s most dastardly and immoral act, Congress’s Dera Baba Nanak MLA Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa claimed that the video had been recorded on May 28, 2017. “Safety of women is of prime importance. I think law would take its own course,” Congress nominee for Gurdaspur bypoll Sunil Jakhar said. The timing of the registration of case was not that important as the matter was of authenticity and everything should be established before taking any action, he added.
 
 “I don’t know the veracity in her (complainant) claims, but I’m sure there shouldn’t have been any reason for her to be weak. Her husband was in police and she would have got the job on compassionate grounds. Why did she get the case registered during elections,” said Istri Akali Dal president Bibi Jagir Kaur, who is camping in Gurdaspur.
 
 The case would not hamper   candidate Swaran Singh Salarai’s campaign, she added. “It is obvious why Langah is implicated in false case during elections.”
