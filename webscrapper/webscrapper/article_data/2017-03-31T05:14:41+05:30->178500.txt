NEW DELHI: The external affairs ministry (MEA) on Thursday invoked India’s intrinsic belief in “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” (the world is one family) to assure African missions that the recent mob violence against some African students in Greater Noida was the handiwork of a few “uninformed and misguided” people.

 India is worried that its diplomatic outreach to   could be undermined by such attacks after Nigeria summoned the Indian envoy to demand strong action against those responsible. The MEA has dubbed the violence as completely unacceptable and a criminal act.
 
 We will continue to welcome African people, including students and youth, as valuable partners,” MEA spokesperson Gopal Baglay said.
 
 “Such acts represent the action of uninformed and misguided few. They do not detract from the deep belief of the government and the people of India of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam. Our engagement with Africa, embodied among others in the implementation of the historic IAFS (  Forum Summit)– III, will continue to grow,” the MEA spokesperson said. “We are engaged with the authorities as well as the (African) students,” he added.
 
 Minister of state for external affairs M J Akbar spoke to the acting high commissioner of Nigeria.
 
 “Law enforcement authorities of the district have made arrests and a large number of people are under watch. The investigation is on and the law of the land will prevail,” he said.
 
 The MEA is in touch with the district administration of Gautam Budh Nagar which has enhanced security in the area.
