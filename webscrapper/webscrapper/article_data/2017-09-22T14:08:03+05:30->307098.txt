CHENNAI: When   and   met   at his residence in the city on Thursday evening, political circles were abuzz with speculation.

 Emerging from the hourlong meeting, Kejriwal told reporters the two had joined hands to fight corruption and communalism. Kejriwal said, “There are a large number of people who are honest and oppose communalism. But there are only rare people like Kamal Haasan who are ready to stick their neck out. He should enter politics rather than curse from outside. “ “I have always been a fan of Kamal as an actor and thought of him as an individual with high integrity and courage, said the AAP leader, who had been received at the airport by Kamal's daughter Akshara Hassan.
 
 The “fruitful meeting“ covered issues pertaining to the country and the state and such a dialogue would continue in the future, the Delhi CM said. Kamal said he was honoured Kejriwal visited his house that had been “in politics right from his father's time“and that he was the only one in the family who had stayed away from it.
 
 Pointing out that he had been alone in the state in raising a voice against communalism and corruption, he said it was no wonder Kejriwal had joined hands with him. “For me, it is a learning curve as I am on an education tour, seeking advice from anyone who is opposed to the two issues to go about my endeavour, “said the veteran actor.
 
 In recent times, Kamal has been active in social media, especially Twitter, taking on the Centre and state governments with caustic comments, even exhorting his fans to write mails to ministers about corruption in government.
 
 Political analyst Ramu Manivannan doesn't give much credence to the coming together of the two. “Kamal retains his position as an articu lator of public dissent; there is no doubt about that. Beyond that, he has not participated in any public protest to be with the people. Similarly,   has hardly made any mark in  , “said Manivannan.
