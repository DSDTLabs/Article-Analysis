Mumbai: The controversy over the   proposed to be set up on the   promenade refuses to die down. 

 On Monday, screenwriter  , actor   and local residents visited Vishwanath Mahades-hwar at Mayor’s Bungalow at Shivaji Park. “We are not against the mobile toilet, but the place is not suitable. The location is on a stretch used by hu-ndreds of morning walkers,” Khan told TOI. “We had suggested a few sites to the BMC, but they were keen on this spot. We met the   and he gave us a patient hearing.” 
 
 Last month, a few local residents, including Khan and Rehman, had written to the BMC opposing its plan to set up the mobile loo on the prom-enade. They had also written to the mayor who, in turn, wr-ote to H-West ward assistant municipal commissioner Sharad Ughade asking him to relocate the portable urinal.
 
 On Monday, Mahadeshwar assured the delegation that he has spoken to Ughade on the issue. “The administration should have sought suggestions/objections from the public before placing the mobile toilet. I was informed that the ward officer only visited the site...I have asked the administration to let me know if due procedure was followed.”
 
 The mobile loo is being set up using local BJP MP Poonam Mahajan’s funds. “We, along with the resident association, had conducted a survey and identified a few spots for portable urinals,” said a senior civic official. Among the other sites identified for mobile loos are near Bandra Fort at Bandstand and Carter Road.
