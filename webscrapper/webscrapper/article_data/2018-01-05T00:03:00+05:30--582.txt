VIJAYWADA: According to the   (NAS) — conducted with a sample of 358 schools from every state of the country — the average performance of students in mathematics in the state of Andhra Pradesh is one point above the national average.

 The city of Vijayawada, considered one of the centres of education in the state, reflects almost the same performance in mathematics, according to experts. However, the satisfactory performance also means that the state still has a long way to go to become one of the best performers in the subject of mathematics in the country.
 
 Average school performances from different school managements in the state do not differ significantly, according to the NAS survey. Private schools perform better than aided and government schools by about 20 and 30 points.
 
 However, compared to other subjects, the difference in terms of performance in mathematics differs significantly among social groups. The difference between the OBC and ST groups is 13 points while the general category group is 10 points above OBC group.
 
 Urban students fare well in mathematics than their counterparts from rural areas. The difference is just eight points and a little effort can easily fill the gap. Boys and girls perform equally in mathematics, but when it comes to languages girl fare better than the boys. Except for social sciences, mathematics scores above all other subjects. Social sciences beat mathematics by one point. In the rest of the subjects, the average performance of AP’s students was found to be significantly lower than the national average -- in English, Science and Modern Indian Languages (MIL) like Telugu.
 
 Breaking down by the percentage of students and their performances, about 16.7 per cent of state students perform well in Mathematics, and another 18.4 per cent fall in the ‘good’ category, according to the NAS sample survey.
