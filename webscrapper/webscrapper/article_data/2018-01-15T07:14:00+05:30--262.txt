GURUGRAM: The Haryana Urban Development Authority (Huda) is planning to set up a waste treatment plant at major parks in the city to convert horticulture waste into compost. According to the officials, the compost will be utilised in the same park. 

 The first plant for re-processing the   will come up at the Leisure Valley Park. Huda officials said that work on the setting up of the plant will begin in 10 days and it is expected to be completed in the next two months. The cost of the project will be Rs 30 lakh. After Leisure Valley Park, Huda plans to set up two such plants at   park and Botanical Garden respectively.
 
 “At present, the city has no plant for treating horticulture waste resulting in waste being dumped on a portion of the park,” said Huda’s executive engineer Sunder Pal adding that the waste treatment plant will help in keeping the parks clean. 
 
 Surendar Yadav, a resident of the Sector 31, said Huda should also develop a system to collect horticulture waste from different parts of the city and treat it at their plants. “This will help in preventing burning of horticulture waste in the city and check pollution,” said Yadav adding that NGT has banned burning of waste and there is provision for penalty but it is hardly enforced. 
 
 The National Green Tribunal (NGT), in a bid to check air pollution, had banned burning of waste in the open in April 2015. It had also announced a fine of Rs 5,000 on anyone who is caught burning dry leaves, plastic, rubber or any other waste material in NCR.
 
 Despite a complete ban on burning waste in the open, residents across the city witnessed the act being repeated with impunity. “People burn waste because they don’t have means and method to dispose the waste,” said Praveen Sharma, resident of the Sector 52 adding that people will not burn the waste if the authorities collect it from different parts of the city.
