Actor-comedian   has been cleared over involvement in the death of his ex-girlfriend  .

 
  
  Both White's husband,  , and her mother,   had sued Carrey, claiming he gave her sexually-transmitted diseases and provided the drugs she used when she took her own life in September 2015.
 
  A representative for the   nominee confirmed that the matters were dismissed on January 25, but wouldn't comment beyond saying the actor is looking forward to moving on with his life.
 
  The 56-year-old, in September last year, had filed a countersuit claiming the lawsuits were an attempt to exploit a famous actor. He also claimed White had extorted him by threatening to go to the press with false allegations that he had given her multiple sexually transmitted diseases.
