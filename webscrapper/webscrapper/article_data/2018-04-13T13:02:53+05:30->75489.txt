Poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge is best known for his Romantic poetry among which "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" and "Kubla Khan" are of special mention. The poet had died on July 1834 at the age of 61. Those who wished to pay their respects to Coleridge would do so at the memorial plaques in St Michael’s church in Highgate. Little did they know that his remains were actually just below! Lying behind a brick wall closing one end of the 17th-century cellar there was a lead coffin with his remains. The space was incorporated into the crypt of St Michael’s when the church was built in 1831 near the top of Highgate Hill in north London. Coleridge’s coffin is well preserved and so are the other coffins rediscovered with his. His wife Sara, his daughter, also named Sara, his son-in-law and his grandson's remains were there as well. Coleridge's body was first buried in the nearby chapel of Highgate school. In 1961 it was observed that Coleridge’s vault had become derelict and the coffins were moved to St Michael’s after an international fundraising appeal. Poet laureate John Masefield gave an address at the unveiling of the stone. Currently, the only way of seeing the coffins is to go down a flight of stairs, through a door and then to clamber over and around piles of bricks and dust. The coffins are just visible through a ventilation brick.
