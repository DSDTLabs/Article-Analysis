Actress   said she has already picked out her dream wedding dress, just three months after becoming engaged to   Bell.

 The pair met and fell in love on the set of the widely-panned ' ' remake in 2015, and in early January, Kate's representative confirmed rumours suggesting Jamie had proposed. 
 
  
  
 Planning for the couple's nuptials is already well underway, and the ' ' star reveals she didn't have to look far to find the perfect gown for their big day. 
 
 When asked how her dress shopping was coming along, Kate, 34, said, "It's taken care of. It's not totally done yet," she adds, before crediting her stylist, Johnny Wujek, with making the dress process 'very easy'". 
 
 The bride-to-be has not revealed her chosen designer, but reveals it's someone she and Johnny were already big fans of. "I knew the designer. I knew before we (Kate and Johnny) really said it out loud. I knew in my head it was going to be that one. We both agreed. Without saying what it is, we knew what it was."
