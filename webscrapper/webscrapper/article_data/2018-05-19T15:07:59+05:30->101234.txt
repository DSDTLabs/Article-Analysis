TRICHY: With only one corporation higher secondary school for a city of 65 wards and population soaring beyond 9 lakh, demands have been rising to upgrade the high schools of the civic body to higher secondary schools. Residents point out that students in many parts of city have been forced to commute far for higher secondary education. Since the few government schools have attained saturation point, upgradation of eligible corporation high schools was the way out. However, there is nothing much to cheer on this front as only Rs 3.51 crore was set apart for education infrastructure in Trichy corporation’s budget tabled recently. 

 Localities like Senthanneerpuram have been bearing the brunt of the absence of higher secondary schools despite having high schools. Students from here as well as   have to go to far-off higher secondary schools after completing class X. Though there is a corporation high school near KK Nagar, due to the absence of higher secondary schools on the outskirts, students have to depend on government school in   and other government aided schools in the heart of the city for higher secondary. “Other tier-II cities in the state have several corporation higher secondary schools but we have only one. Though we are among small cities, more high schools should be upgraded,”  , a resident of Woraiyur, said.
 
 The existing Senthanneerpuram high school was identified as a potential school for upgrading infrastructure and development works for more than Rs 1.5 crore are under way. With as many as 30 students passing out of the high school every year, most of them are said to be moving to government aided schools in the city. “The decision to upgrade school infrastructure lies with the school education department in Chennai. We will look into the demands,” a senior official with education department said.
