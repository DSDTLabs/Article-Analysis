VISAKHAPATNAM: Finally, after a wait of two long years, the radiation unit of King George Hospital’s oncology department would get going by March-end as the   (radiation equipment) is getting transported from Mumbai in a special vehicle.

 Since January 2015, the department has been waiting for cobalt sources as the existing cobalt therapy unit was in need of a new radiation source as it has been in use since 2002 because of which the strength of the radioactive material had decreased.
 
 Head of the department of oncology at   said, “Finally, all payments and paperwork are ready. The radioactive material placed in a secured lead container will soon be despatched in a special vehicle approved by   ( ). It will take five-six days for the equipment to reach here. After that, radiation safety officers (RSO) from Kakinada would come and check about setting up the cobalt unit. For this costly equipment, we had got Rs 50 lakh from the department of atomic energy while the district collector has given Rs 24 lakh from the   (HDS) funds.”
 
 The oncology department of KGH used to get around 50-60 patients per day, and they had to go to other private hospitals due to a non-functional radiation unit for the last two years. “Once the cobalt unit is set up and gets going, patients needn’t go to other hospitals and we can also generate some funds for the hospital by treating Aarogyasri patients,” added Dr Sujatha.
