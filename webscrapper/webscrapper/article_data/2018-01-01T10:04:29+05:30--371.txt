PUNE: The   (HSP) and Pune-Mumbai expressway officials made elaborate arrangements on Sunday to deal with the New Year’s Eve rush. But as it turned out, very few vehicles plied on the roads on Sunday evening. 

 The officials had put measures in place on the Pune-Mumbai expressway, the old Pune-Mumbai highway and the   highway.
 
 “The HSP and Pune officials have made an elaborate plan to avert traffic jams on these highways and the expressway on Sunday,” claimed superintendent of HSP Amol Tambe.
 
 For the weekend, many from Mumbai, Pune and other cities had made a beeline to Lonavla, Khandala and Mahabaleshwar. The HSP expected these people to head back home on Sunday evening. 
 
 However, until late on Sunday night, the highways in question witnessed only normal traffic. 
 
 HSP officials told TOI that there were very few vehicles, especially cars and SUVs, on these roads.
 
 The HSP had decided to halt vehicular movement on different spots on the expressway as well as on the   to facilitate hassle-free journey for Mumbai-bound motorists. 
 
 HSP expected many vehicles to start driving towards Mumbai or Pune from Mahabaleshwar, Wai and   areas late in the evening, which could cause congestion.
