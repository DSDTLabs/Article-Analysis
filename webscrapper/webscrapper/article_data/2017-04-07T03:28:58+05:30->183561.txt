NAVI MUMBAI: The traffic department has banned heavy motor vehicles on the 3-km stretch of road from Turbhe Naka to   slums, to prevent accidents caused by these speeding vehicles heading towards the Turbhe quarries MIDC. But the department is still to take action against the illegally parked vehicles on Pfizer road. 

 Customers, visiting garages, scrap vendors, automobile accessories shops and hotels located along this stretch, illegally park their vehicles on both sides of the road.
 
 Senior inspector Shyam Shinde, Turbhe traffic unit said, "Traffic cops are using jammers on vehicles parked here and levying penalty. But motorists continue to park their vehicles along the road, causing snarls."
 
 He added that they have provided an alternate route from   company. Vehicles can take a right turn from Shalimar hotel to reach Indira Nagar, bypassing Pfizer road. The HMVs coming from Indira Nagar will have to turn left from Hanuman temple junction, travel along MIDC road to reach till   and turn right to travel till   and reach Thane-Belapur Road.
 
 A quarry owner said that the diversion will be time and fuel consuming for dumpers coming to the quarries. "The cops should start odd-even parking on Pfizer road," he added.
