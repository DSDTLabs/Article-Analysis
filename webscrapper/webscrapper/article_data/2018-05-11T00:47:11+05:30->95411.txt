Madurai: As many as 22 sheep have succumbed to one of the first reported outbreaks of anthrax in Madurai district in over two decades. Anthrax is a deadly infectious disease caused by the bacterium bacillus anthracis which can transmit to humans by way of contact with infected animals. 

 Confirming the outbreak, Regional Joint Director of Animal Husbandry, Madurai, Dr R Rajasekharan said that the department was taking all steps to contain the disease. On April 19, though some sheep were found dead, laboratory tests had ruled out anthrax. However, the dreaded disease was confirmed when a farmer in Karaikeni village, T Kallupatti block of Peraiyur taluk, reported the death of his sheep on May 7 and the blood samples were tested at the Tamil Nadu Animal and Veterinary Sciences University (Tanuvas) and Central University lab.
 
 Anthrax bacteria which exist as spores in the soil infect grazing animals after summer rains when the conditions are conducive. The animals can be saved if the degree of infection is less than 50%. The bacterium affects sheep, goat, cattle and buffaloes. After the confirmation of the disease, five teams of veterinarians comprising three members each were constituted to vaccinate all susceptible cattle and sheep within an 8-kilometre radius of the village where the infection was detected.
 
 A total of 23,371 cattle have to be vaccinated of which 6,000 animals have been vaccinated till date. The JD said that he was hopeful that the vaccination of the remaining animals would be achieved by Friday or Saturday. While four more animals succumbed on Wednesday, no deaths were reported on Thursday. He said that they had adequate stocks of vaccines to contain the disease immediately and are planning to create awareness about the disease in the villages in the region.
