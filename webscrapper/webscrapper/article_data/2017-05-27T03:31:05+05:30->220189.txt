NOIDA: The   issued to the learners of at least four driving schools won’t be considered valid, the transport department said on Thursday, after a local organisation complained that they were using private vehicles for teaching.

 The president of Jan Swabhiman Seva Samiti (JSSS), a Nithari-based organisation, had earlier written to the deputy transport commissioner (DTC) of Meerut zone, Arvind Kumar Pandey, complaining that several driving schools were using private vehicles not registered for commercial purposes. Schools named in the complaint include Anu Motor  , Sector 66, Yogendra Driving School, Sector 12,   Motor Driving School, Sector 41, and Gaurav Motor Driving School, Sector 53.
 
 The owners of the schools claimed that the complaint was false and based on the “vested interests” of a rival training school.
 
 The DTC had ordered an inquiry into the issue on May 20, holding the driving certificates issued by the schools concerned invalid until the inquiry is over. After receiving the order, the Noida transport department also restrained the schools from issuing certificates to learners.
 
 The department has given licences to 16 driving schools in the district to provide driving certificates to four-wheeler learners. Those receiving the certificates from these schools are exempt from taking the driving test, and are issued a driving licence without one.
 
 “We forwarded the complaint to the DTC only after we got proof,” said JSSS president Harendra Singh.
 
 Assistant regional transport officer SK Singh, who is heading the inquiry of the driving schools, said: “Transport department officials visited the schools on Thursday. The inquiry is going on.”
