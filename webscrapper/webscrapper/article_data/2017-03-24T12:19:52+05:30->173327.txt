VADODARA: Mukesh Patel, principal of a school in Jhalod in Dahod district was caught accepting a bribe from a youth, who had been selected for post of teaching assistant in district school. The principal had sought the bribe to give him a joining letter.

 The youth Vijaykumar Parmar had applied for the job through online recruitment conducted for the post. He was appointed to the   at Chitrodiya in Jhalod taluka run by the Adivasi Yuva Seva Sangh.
 
 Parmar went to join the school for the first time in December last year, but was asked to come later. When he approached the school again, he was asked to pay a donation. When he contacted the school over the phone later, he was asked to pay a hefty sum. The amount was eventually settled at Rs 1.5lakh after negotiations.
 
 In the meantime, Parmar was even called to the school and did some work there. 
 
 But he was still not made to join the school formally and returned to his residence in the Banaskantha district.
 
 Frustrated with the state of affairs, Parmar even wrote to the Dahod district education officer, but did not get a response. He approached education department officials, but could not get a redressal.
 
 Eventually, Parmar approached the   over its toll free number and sought their help in the matter. The ACB registered a formal complaint by Parmar on Wednesday and a trap was laid to nab the principal Mukesh Patel.
 
 Patel called Parmar at his residence to accept the bribe amount. The ACB sleuths swooped down at this time and nabbed Patel accepting the bribe.
