Kolkata: In a significant development in the   sting operation case, defence lawyers on Thursday challenged in Calcutta high court the authenticity of the device used by Narada News boss Mathew  .

  Calling the footages a “copy of copy of copy without the original version”, they accused Samuel of “cleaning the hard disk” of the laptop before it was submitted in court.
 
 In the court of Justice Joymalya Bagchi, Aparupa Poddar’s lawyer Sidharth Luthra argued that the iPhone with which the sting operation was done was never submitted with the court. The CBI lodged the FIR based on footage that Samuel claimed to be copies of the original one. “The footage was recorded on an iPhone, then it was transferred to a Mac laptop and then transferred to a pen drive…the iPhone Samuel spoke about initially has a different IMEI number than the one he had submitted later on,” Luthra argued. 
 
 He argued that the different in IMEI number and serial number (SN) of the phone raises primary doubts about the authenticity of the tapes. “The device which he (Samuel) has submitted with the court is not the original one,” Luthra said. He has also raised questions about the dates of “some of the files” or footages.
 
 Samuel had told CBI that the operation system on the Mac laptop needs updates and he had not reinstalled the software. Meanwhile, he has expressed his inability to appear before Muchipara police on August 7 citing his mother’s ill health.
