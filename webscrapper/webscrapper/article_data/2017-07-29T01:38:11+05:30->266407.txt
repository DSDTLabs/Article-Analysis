ISLAMABAD: In a landmark verdict in the  , the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Friday disqualified Prime Minister   from holding public office for life over money laundering, concealment of wealth and establishing offshore assets and companies.

 The PM House issued a notification stating that Sharif, despite having “strong reservations” over the verdict, has stepped down from his post. 
 
 At a meeting of stalwarts of Sharif ’s party PML(N) and its coalition partners held at PM house, his brother and Punjab CM   was chosen as his successor, sources said.
 
 Sharif ’s daughter Maryam Nawaz, considered his political heir, has been ruled out for the top post as she has also been indicted along with her brothers and her husband.
 
 However, PML(N) will have to opt for a stop-gap PM for at least seven weeks, till Shahbaz gets himself elected to the national assembly and becomes PM after qutting as CM. PML (N) said the next PM’s name will be announced in 24 hours. 
 
 The unanimous verdict by a five-judge bench, delivered in a packed courtroom, unseats Sharif from premiership for the third time and denies him the opportunity to become the country’s first PM to complete a full five-year term.
