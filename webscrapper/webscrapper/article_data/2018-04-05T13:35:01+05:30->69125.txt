MARGAO: Women’s organisation   on Wednesday demanded that additional police personnel be posted at the anti-human trafficking unit situated within the premises of the   district police headquarters. The station currently has one male and one female police sub-inspector (PSI). 

 “There is an urgent need for another PSI as well as more male police constables (PCs), because they rescue the victims while arresting the offenders for trafficking,” said Bailancho Ekvott convener, Auda Viegas. 
 
 “In December last year, I had filed a complaint against the chief secretary, director general of police (DGP), and South Goa superintendent of police (SP) before the   regarding the lack of facilities at the   police station in  . On April 2, they were directed to submit a compliance report to the commission within three months,” Viegas added.
 
 Bailancho Ekvott has been demanding better amenities, including a spacious women police station instead of the present cramped conditions the police personnel presently endure. “However, SP (South)   has taken personal interest by ensuring that they have toilets, water facility like a cooler, tables, chairs, etc,” Viegas said. “I have also suggested a creche, and I have been told that they are looking into the matter. But I have full faith that SP Gawas will ensure these amenities for the women staff working there.”
