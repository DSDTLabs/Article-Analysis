NEW DELHI: The black jacket, cap and jeans had come to define  , who could zip through a crowded market on her bike without much fuss. Her skills earned her notoriety as someone who could pull off   and evade patrol cops with equal ease. 

 While two of her companions — who rode pillion — snatched belongings, it was her task to ensure a safe and quick getaway. Their run, however, lasted till Tuesday. She was nabbed, along with her friends, Danish and Shehbaz, who were in jail till last week.
 
 Questioned by ACP (Seemapuri) Ram Singh, Razia disclosed that she joined Danish and Shehbaz to fund her need for drugs, to which she got addicted after losing her father 15 years ago. 
 
 Neighbours said the family didn’t interact much with anyone. The eldest of the three kids, Nadeem, used to have frequent fights with his mother. After some time, he started staying away for long hours to avoid conflict, even as he drove an auto rickshaw to sustain the family. This all affected Razia, who one day, found drugs in his brother’s clothes and tasted it, police said. She initially befriended a girl from her neighbourhood who would help her procure drugs, but later started taking it from her brother.
 
 Nadeem committed suicide in October last year, allegedly after another fight with his mother. 
 
 Police said Danish and Shehbaz were Nadeem’s friends and got in touch with Razia through him. They would take drugs together, before the duo was arrested in a burglary case. When they came out of jail, they asked her to lend them Nadeem’s motorcycle. Instead, Razia chose to join them in their plans.
