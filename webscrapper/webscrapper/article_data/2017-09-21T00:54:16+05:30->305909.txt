MUMBAI: Several parts of Mumbai experienced more rainfall between September 19 and 20 than it had on August 29, when the city was brought down to its knees. This time, though, planned civic measures ensured that at least some of the traditional   could stay above water.

 At Hindmata, one of the chronic flooding spots, for instance, the water receded quickly. “Unlike last month, when water had accumulated at   in Dadar for long hours, on Wednesday, we managed to drain it out faster,” said an official. Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta visited Hindamata and the storm water pumping stations of south Mumbai on Wednesday afternoon. 
 
 Besides, NDRF and Mumbai   was put on alert to handle the downpour, said officials. 
 
 On Tuesday’s downpour, a senior   officer said, “The rain patterns of August 29 and September 19 were vastly different, even though both days saw similar amount of downpour. Between September 19 and 20, we found that the rainfall was evenly spread in several parts of the city. Due to this, the drains were able to tackle the constant flood water. There were no spikes.” He recollected that by contrast, on August 29, there was heavy downpour over just three hours, which coupled with high tide, caused waterlogging in several areas.
 
 Former Congress corporator Brian Miranda of Kalina pointed out that at Air India Colony did get submerged but the water was drained quickly.
 
 A motorist said that Western Express Highway and Bandra-Worli Sea Link was free of traffic as few ventured out. This further reduced chances of a crisis situation. 
 
 A BMC official said, “On Wednesday, we took extra precautions for the expected high tide. While some parts did get more rain, we mobilized our staff on the ground to ensure that the same could recede faster,” said an official.
