PUNE: Wildlife photographer  , who is in the city for the   International Film Festival, said not enough is being done to preserve the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats. 

 “I am not really an authority on the subject and whether the ghats have been preserved enough is a complicated question, but I do feel that a line needs to be drawn between need and greed. In the place I am from, the green cover has diminished over the years. I wish the elephants and tigers could vote,” said Shankar, who has been capturing images professionally for 20 years.
 
 When asked about what constitutes a great photograph, Shankar had a response many would consider iconoclastic. “If you go to any search engine and find a list of the greatest photographs ever taken, the subjects you will usually find are crimes against humanity, or of death and despair. For example, there was a Pulitzer-winning photograph by  , of a vulture and a starving child in famine-hit Sudan. It was shot from the little girl’s point of view, to tell the world about the condition in Sudan. If it was shot from the vulture’s point-of-view, it would have been just another appeal to conserve various vulture species. This can be because humans, by nature, care only about other humans,” Shankar said.
 
 The photographer is in the city for an exhibition of his work at the 12th Kirloskar Vasundhara International Film Festival. A popular name, he has also been published in leading wildlife magazines over the years.
 
 Shankar added   and the   are his favourite places to shoot. With improvements in technology, aspects of photography have evolved over the years — “the quality has improved massively” — and, despite various mishaps, Shankar feels safer in the jungles.
 
  “I am more stressed while heading to the forest from the airport than when I am in the forest itself. I would much rather be inside the jungle, around wildlife, than in a city,” he laughed.
