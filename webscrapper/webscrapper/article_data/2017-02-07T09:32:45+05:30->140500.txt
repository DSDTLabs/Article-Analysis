AHMEDABAD: University exams are stressful for most students. However, it appears that many take to extremes in a bid to pass the exams, especially when unprepared. This was observed by evaluators of   for the statistics paper for B.Com semester 1. 

 A student of B.Com Semester 1 allegedly wrote abuses and expletives in the answersheet for statistics paper and also threatened the professor to not fail him. The matter came to light after the university exam coordinator informed varsity officials about it. The varsity officials have been directed to register a case of using unfair means in an examination.
 
 “Examination Reform Committee will decide on the further course of action in the matter. It is yet to be identified whether the student misconducted himself in other exam papers too,” said an official.
 
 Well-placed sources in the varsity revealed that a similar case was reported in the university around three years ago when a student wrote expletives in the answersheet and submitted it. The results for all the subjects were cancelled for the entire semester, said sources.
