GHAZIABAD: Hundreds of   employees, politicians across parties, close relatives and friends on Tuesday gathered at the brewer’s headquarters in Ghaziabad to pay   (retd), chairman of the company and the man behind the   rum brand who passed away earlier this month.

 Mohan (88) had passed away on January 6 following a prolonged illness. Vinay Mohan, his nephew and a director in Mohan Meakin, said, “His death marks the end of an era. We have lost a great person, a leader and a mentor who guided us. He was a father figure to his employees. Whatever we are today is because of him. He taught us great values and we know he will keep blessing us always.”
 
 Walking down memory lane and recalling his association with Mohan, JD(U) general secretary K C Tyagi said, “I had a long association with him, not as an industrialist but as a social activist. He had been a part of social and political activities in Ghaziabad. I can say he was really a monk, although he represented ‘Old Monk’. He used to sit, sing songs and eat among his workers. He was quite different from today’s money-minded entrepreneurs.”
 
 Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Shukla said Mohan’s contribution had been immense to the growth of the industry during his time. “He was a pioneer of the industry. He was also widely known in political circles and had friends cutting across the party lines,” Shukla said.
