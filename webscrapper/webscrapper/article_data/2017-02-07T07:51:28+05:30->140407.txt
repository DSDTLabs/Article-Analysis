LUCKNOW: Police scanned on Monday the call detail record (CDR) of all the family members who were present at the time   allegedly committed suicide. A chest specialist, Dr Sircar was found dead on the terrace of his house in   on Thursday evening. 

 ASP(trans-gomti) Durgesh Kumar said they would conclude it was a crime only after the report of the forensic science lab. SHO, Mahanagar, SK Singh said police were examining all the aspects.
 
 Ballestic experts said two bullets hit Dr Sircar â€” one got imbedded inside his skull while the other shot hit the left side of the brain. They said this can happen in case of tandem shot in which either the trigger was not pressed properly on the first occasion or the bullet got stuck in the spring of the nozzle. It can also happen if the gun powder inside the bullet was not filled properly. In all the conditions, as a reflex, a person could press the trigger twice. When that happens, the two bullets go in different directions, leading to two injuries simultaneously.
