Indore: Chandrapal Singh Rajawat had made the last phone call to his family around 7.45pm on January 16, informing them he would be late for dinner. He was later found by a passerby on a road to his village in Mundakheda bleeding from his head. Rajawat, whose organs were donated by his family giving a new lease of life to four individuals, could not gain consciousness, despite being rushed to a hospital in Ujjain within an hour after he was found on the road at 8.30pm. “Doctors said his chances of survival were slim. We took him to a hospital in Indore, where he was declared brain dead,” said Chandrapal’s relative Raghuveer Singh Rathore. Chandrapal is survived by his father Bhupendra Singh Rajawat, wife Deep Kunwar, daughter Sakshi (16) and son Harshwardhan (14). The family was not sure if he met with an accident while riding the motorcycle, or he suffered a cerebral stroke causing him to fall, Rathore said. Once it was confirmed that he couldn’t be saved through any sort of surgery, the family was quick to decide on donating his organs. “What could be better than giving life to people in death? Chandrapal’s wife and other family members immediately agreed to donate his organs once doctors confirmed he was brain dead,” he said. Chandrapal hailed from a family of jagirdar’s who reported to the erstwhile Dewas state. He was the eldest among three brothers and was also a panchayat secretary at Mundakheda village. His children studied in a boarding school in Ujjain. The family could not fathom that he has passed away. They claim he still lives in people he had helped survive. Chandrapal’s liver was transplanted into Ajay Agrawal (60) of Saket Nagar, kidneys in Arpit Agrawal (18) of Rajgarh and Mukta Karamchandan (46) of Bhakti Nagar Indore and the heart was given to Neelam (46) of Haryana at a hospital in Delhi. Ironically, Agrawal’s family met Chandrapal’s and could not stop thanking them for the donation. “We are now one family,” they told the grieving family.
