HYDERABAD: The power demand in Telangana touched a record 211 million units (around 10,000 MW) on Tuesday, the highest ever in the state. 

 The unprecedented rise in demand is attributed to rising temperature, triggering increase in use of air-conditioners. The 24-hour supply to agriculture for the   season has also fuelled the consumption. 
 
 On Tuesday, the daily peak demand touched 10,040 MW against the normal of 8,400 MW. According to   officials, the day consumption will cross 11,000 MW in a week or 10 days. "We have already met the highest demand of 10,040 MW on Tuesday. In the coming days, it may cross 11,000 MW. We are geared up to comply with 220 million units per day. At present, without any cuts to other sectors, we are supplying 24-hr power to farmers," D Prabhakar Rao, Transco and   , told TOI. 
 
  On Monday, the Transco received 3,567 MW from interstate power stations, including Chhattisgarh, 1,337 MW from bilateral purchases and 1,289 MW from exchanges.
 
 The power consumption in the state has surpassed even Andhra Pradesh. Telangana has now become the second biggest power consumer in south India after Tamil Nadu. "Solar power has come to the rescue as we are getting over 18 million units per day  ," said the Transco CMD.
