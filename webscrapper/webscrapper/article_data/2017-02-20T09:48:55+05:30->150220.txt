JAIPUR: "He told me that 19/30 was the highest mark that they would award and some students may not clear the exam. He also gave his account number and asked me to deposit Rs 10,000 if I didn't want to spoil the careers of these 27 students who appeared for the exam," said Rangrez. The caller was unaware that   had recorded the conversation between them. 

 "I submitted all the evidence to the   on the same day and am hopeful that strict action would be taken against culprits," he said. Incidentally, Rangrez, a history teacher, had won Rs 1 crore in the seventh season of the 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' hosted by   in 2013.
 
 Radhey Shyam Sharma, district education officer of Chittorgarh, has forwarded the complaint to RBSE, Ajmer. "We have clear evidence against the errant examiners," said Sharma.
 
 Similarly, another case was reported in Bhilwara on Saturday after the examiner demanded Rs 150 per student for awarding full marks for geography practical exam. Usha Sharma, principal of Government Senior Secondary School in Bhilwara, said, "I have recorded the conversation with the examiner Ravi Shankar of Dausa. The matter has been reported to the education department."
 
 Experts feel that this could be the tip of an iceberg. Interestingly, the RBSE has registered an unbelievable 10-fold increase in the number of students scoring 90% and above in Class XII science, commerce and arts streams from 2013 to 2016. In most cases, students who barely received pass marks in the main examination had scored 90% and above in internals/practicals.
