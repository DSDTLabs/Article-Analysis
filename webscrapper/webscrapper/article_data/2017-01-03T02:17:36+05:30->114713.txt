NEW DELHI:   borrowed from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2014 ‘chai pe charcha’   to hit back at him for  . The drive named ‘chaurahe pe charcha’ saw senior party members and MLAs leading rallies across the city and talking to people about the impact of the note ban.

 In Laxmi Nagar, AAP’s Delhi convener Dilip Pandey and MLA Nitin Tyagi led volunteers who got the locals to sign a notice, “dismissing” the PM for failing to curb black money, terrorism and corruption. 
 
 “People have hundreds of questions for the PM relating to the Sahara-Birla diary, the connection between Paytm and BJP, loss of livelihood for thousands of people, lack of money and the failure of the PM’s claims that demonetisation will bring back black money, end terrorism etc. Since he has failed on so many counts, we have issued this notice in which the public at large has dismissed him as the PM,” Pandey said.
 
 At a vegetable market, many complained about loss in business. Avdhesh Kumar, who owns a cycle repair shop, spoke about how his relatives were forced to serve ‘khichdi’ at a wedding in Bihar’s Siwan. “There has been a major loss in business and I personally do not believe that this move has affected the black money economy. The corrupt are continuing to function as before while the poor man is suffering,” he said.
 
 Dinesh Gupta, a vegetable vendor, said his daily income had come down from Rs 1,000-1,500 per day to about Rs 500.
