HYDERABAD: The Andhra Pradesh government will soon set up the   run by any state government in the county to receive   from beneficiaries of  . The call centre to be set up in CM N  's Command Control Centre (CCC) in Vijayawada will initially employ 500. It's likely to cost the state about Rs 30 crore annually. 

 "This will be unique in the country, with a capacity of 98,000 outbound and 25,000 inbound calls daily. It will also provide jobs to many in the capital area," C Kutumba Rao,   planning board vice-chairman, said. 
 
 Ever since the TDP regime took over in 2014, the planning department has done several surveys to get feedback on flagship programmes. But unlike these periodic surveys, the call centre will do it on a day-to-day basis. In the initial days, the call centre will take responses from beneficiaries of more than 25 schemes run by 46 departments to further calibrate them. The call centre would allow beneficiaries to make complaints. 
 
 AP will be the third state after UP and Rajasthan to set up this kind of call centre, but with more capacity and inbound call facility. "If needed we will increase the budget for it as this is a game-changer in delivery of state schemes," Rao said. The call centre is part of the Centre's India BPO Promotion Scheme (IBPS).
