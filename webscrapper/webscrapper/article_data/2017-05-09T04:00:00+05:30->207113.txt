AHMEDABAD: As many as 352 people died if electrocution in   in 2016-17, compared to 315 in 2015-16, an increase of 11.74%. However, the number of non-fatal electrical accidents involving humans reduced to 256 in 2016-17 from 262 in 2015-16.

 The deaths of animals by electrocution rose 12.74% to 460 in 2016-17, from 408 in the preceeding year.
 
 “An analysis of standard of performance reports (SoP) available on   ( ) shows that there have been 11.74% more human deaths by electrocution. This comes despite the state regulatory authority saying that it is closely monitoring the issue of electrocution deaths,” said K K Bajaj, a city-based energy policy expert.
 
 Other experts suggest that deaths are also caused due to people not following proper safety measures, especially in rural areas, and faulty equipment.
 
 “Distribution companies (discoms) do not provide details of action taken against employees responsible for accidents and are reluctant to share details of compensation paid in terms of the amount and the number of victims,” Bajaj added.
