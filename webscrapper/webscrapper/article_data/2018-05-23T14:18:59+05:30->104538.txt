The incidents continued unabated and the cops not only failed to solve any of them, but also could not find how weapons and phones were smuggled inside. The recent jailbreak, in which two brothers escaped, has again brought the prison’s vulnerability in focus.
 
 “We have sought a separate police post to deal with the cases related to the jail. The officials recover mobiles and contrabands from inmates and get an   lodged. But the investigation has been very poor so far. The police have not been able to find how prohibited articles reached the inmates. We hope that the nod for the police post will be given soon,” said a senior jail official.

To step up security and ensure discipline in the jail, the authorities are planning regular shuffling and change of duties. We are also planning to make some infrastructural changes inside the premises and the department will approach sponsors after finalizing the plan,” he added.
