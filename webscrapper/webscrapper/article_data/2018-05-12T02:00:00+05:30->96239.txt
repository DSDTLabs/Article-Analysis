PATNA: The Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited (BSRDCL) recently completed the construction work of a ten- metre-wide road along the western embankment of Digha-Danapur canal.

 The road also passes underneath the Digha-AIIMS elevated road that connects NH-98 near   to Digha (on the  ) at Patna.
 
 “The 10.6km road embankment can serve as the best option for people travelling from AIIMS at  , Bailey Road and Digha. It is of four lanes for 2km from AIIMS and the remaining stretch is of two lanes that also connects to  , one of the most congested roads in Patna,” a BSRDCL official said on Thursday.
 
 The road will serve as an alternative for Digha-AIIMS elevated road as the elevated structure does not have any intermediate connectivity, he said.
 
 Giving details of the project, the official said the contract was allotted to Mumbai-based Gammon   and the work that began in September 2016 was completed on April 19 this year. The Rs 124-crore project was funded by the BSRDCL, he said and added street lights have been installed along the entire stretch.
 
 Locals are delighted. “This road is a boon for people travelling from Digha to Phulwarisharif and vice versa. We earlier had to take a circuitous route via Danapur or Bailey Road to reach either side. The travel time and distance have also reduced drastically,” said Pratysh Kumar of Ashiana Nagar.
 
 Trader   nodded. “The vehicular inflow on Digha- Danapur and   roads has increased following the opening of the Digha-Sonepur rail-cum-road bridge. As such, there was an urgent need of an alternate road to avoid congestion of vehicles,”   said.
