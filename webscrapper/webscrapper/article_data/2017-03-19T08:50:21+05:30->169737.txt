CHENNAI:   are not new to 'domination'. If you look at the history of the Justice Party, you will know how the powerful   dominated the Madras Presidency, making the   their 'subordinates' in administration. 

  More's new book "Dravida Katchiyin Ezhuchiyum Veezhciyum, 1916-1946" ('The rise and fall of the 'Dravidian' justice party) talks about the origin and development of the first phase of   after the Justice Party, a political outfit established by T M Nair and P Theagaraya Chetty, was launched in the Madras Presidency in 1916.
 
 In his book, More argues that the non-Brahmin Justice party came into existence in 1916 to counter Tamil Brahmin domination of the political and administrative life of the Madras Presidency. It was promoted mainly by elite non-Tamil Telugu businessmen and zamindars like Theagaraya Chetty, Panagal Raja and Bobbili Raja. The party was later taken over by E V Ramasamy Naiker of Telugu-Kannada ancestry who renamed the Justice party as the Dravidar Kazhagam in1944.
 
 The Aryan-Dravidian theory was sponsored by the Christian missionaries and British administrators in pursuit of their divide-and-rule policy, according to More. The Justice Party leaders took over this theory from them to compete with the Tamil Brahmins in politics and administration. "For them, the Tamil Brahmins were of Aryan origin, while the non-Brahmin Tamils were Dravidian, sons of the soil. The Brahmins themselves contributed to the development of this racial theory as they rarely countered the propaganda of the Telugu-dominated Justice party leaders," said More, after releasing his book in the city on Saturday.
