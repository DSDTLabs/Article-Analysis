Panaji: Investigations by Goa police have revealed that all the accused caught for online prostitution, prostitution, possession of drugs, and online scams use fraudulent sim cards to evade arrests.  Director general of police (DGP) Muktesh Chander told TOI that mostly Nigerians used fake sim cards for the drug trade. Chander has written to the DGPs of other states to provide details of cellphone numbers used in Goa to promote escort services so that the Goa police can crack down on culprits. Police have arrested over 20 persons, including a mobile telecom company dealer, for issuing fraudulent sim cards. Chander said that in most cases the sim card is purchased outside the state and the accused use it to run operations in Goa. During the investigation of many cases, police found that telecom company dealers issue sim cards without verifying the credentials of the person. The DGP said that in case the cell number is an out of state one, he writes to his counterpart in other states and ask them to verify the address and get back to the Goa police so that the accused can be arrested. “If the address is fake then that police should take action against the telecom dealer,” the DGP said. He added that if other state police follow Goa’s procedure, then the fake sim card problem will be resolved and dealers will think twice before issuing sim cards using fake documents.
