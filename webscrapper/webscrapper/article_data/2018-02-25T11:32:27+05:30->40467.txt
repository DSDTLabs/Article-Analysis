PATNA: Patna   chief justice   on Saturday said tribunals in the state are running only in papers. “There is a huge shortage of manpower in tribunals in the state. As a result, these tribunals have failed to reduce the burden on other courts,” Menon said while addressing the second national conference on ‘State Tribunals of India’ here. He added there should be a proper mechanism to run these tribunals.

 The conference was organised by Chanakya National Law University. Chairman-cum-member of Board of Revenue (Bihar) Tirpurari Sharan, minister of revenue and land reforms Ram Narayan Mandal, Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor, district magistrate Kumar Ravi, former judges of tribunals, officers and faculty members of law colleges were also present.
 
 In the first session, the experts spoke on ‘India’s tryst with   and its key challenges in terms of natural justice, procedural fairness and equity’. The session was chaired by Patna high court justice A Amanullah.
 
 Retired member of Lokayukta (Bihar)   said, “Irrational growth of tribunals is one of the major challenges. These tribunals have made justice system in the country clumsy. To make the tribunals effective and fair, it is necessary to free them from the control of their respective departments.”
 
 Former justice of Andhra Pradesh high court G Yethirajulu said tribunals should maintain an unbiased attitude and give fair chance to all to justify themselves.
 
 The second and third sessions were on ‘Capacity building of tribunals – legislative reforms’ and ‘Administrative law and its Germaneness to the state tribunals’, respectively.
