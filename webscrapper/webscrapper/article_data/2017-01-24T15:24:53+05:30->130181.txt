PANAJI: The Kadamba Transport Corporation Limited’s (KTCL) main bus stand in Panaji will soon move to Merces, and the existing one will be used as an intra-city terminus, defence minister   said on Sunday.

 “The current KTCL bus terminus in Panaji will cater to transportation in the city,” he said. “The main one will be shifted near the Merces junction, along the Ponda bypass.”
 
 He added that the new premises will be convenient for buses heading towards Mapusa, since they would be able to go directly without having to take the Panaji roundabout.
 
 KTCL has over 500 buses, of which 94 are interstate buses, 278 intrastate, 83 schoolbuses and the rest on standby. Plying on a daily basis, around 350 private buses also operate at the terminus.
 
 Parrikar also promised relief to   commuters who are often stuck in jams. “The work of the new   bridge is going well,” he said. “This year, the bridge will finally be complete.”
