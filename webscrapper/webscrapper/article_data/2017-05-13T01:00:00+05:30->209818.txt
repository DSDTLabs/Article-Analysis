 Among other things, the former Olympian silver medallist spoke about the existing Cinematograph Act being reviewed. “He was going through the old book collection at NFAI and spotted the Cinematograph Committee report of 1927-28. That’s when he told us about the ministry planning to review the Cinematograph Act 1952,” shared Prakash Magdum, director of NFAI.
 
  
  
 
 While Rathore appreciated the facility’s efforts in film preservation, it was an old projector that caught his interest. “He remembered having seen a similar projector before but was all ears when we explained to him the difference between this one and the one he had previously seen,” added Magdum. It was interesting to see the minister turning guest projectionist at NFAI’s projection room.
 
 At the FTII campus, Rathore had an impromptu interaction with the students of the Film Appreciation course. “The minister spoke about the need for generating quality cinema and appreciated the institute’s short courses doing the same. He stressed on cinema to be taken to the masses as well,” informed Varun Bharadwaj, registrar, FTII.
