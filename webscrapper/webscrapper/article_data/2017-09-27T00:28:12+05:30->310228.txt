MUMBAI: A day after meeting   chief Amit Shah, former chief minister Narayan Rane is likely to float a Konkan-based political outfit. During Rane’s interaction with Shah in the presence state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve and revenue minister Chandrakant Patil on Monday there was no discussion on his entry into the BJP. 

 Rane’s aide said that the former   leader Rane felt that floating a new party would be a better option. Rane was unavailable for comment. “Rane may set up an organization in Konkan and extend support to the BJP in the ensuing gram panchayat and 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly polls,” the aide said. 
 
 Rane has grassroots connect in Konkan, which he has nurtured as his stronghold.
 
  “Rane met Shah to invite him for the inauguration of a hospital in his home town Sindhudurg,” Patil said.
 
 Ever since the rout of Rane’s son Nilesh in the 2014 general election, followed by his own defeat in the assembly polls, Rane was planning to quit the Congress. 
 
 Speculation was rife over his joining BJP after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, followed by Danve visited his home during Ganeshotsav. A proposal for his entry into BJP was earlier discussed with Shah in the presence of Fadnavis and Danve at the CM’s official residence. The BJP had then proposed to accommodate Rane in Rajya Sabha, his son Nitesh in state cabinet and elder son Nilesh in the Lok Sabha. However, Rane was keen on his induction into the state cabinet. Fadnavis had strongly opposed Rane’s proposal, saying, it would result in instability.
 
 Even as the debate was in progress, Rane quit the Congress on September 21 on the grounds that party chief Sonia Gandhi and her political advisor Ahmed Patel had twarted his taking over as chief minister during Congress rule. BJP leaders said that Shah and Fadnavis would take the final decision on Rane’s induction.
