AHMEDABAD: The September 2015   of the commercial tax department, which had raised a mammoth value added tax ( ) liability of Rs 3,781 crore against a leading brokerage firm in Ahmedabad involved in derivatives trading, was not run through the   before being set aside by the appellate officer. 

 The   (PAC) document with TOI mentions that the Rs 3,781 crore assessment order executed by the commercial tax, unit 15, had pressed that derivatives trading carried out through various commodity exchanges were liable to pay VAT.
 
 The PAC document cited another major issue in the 526-page assessment order that claimed that the state government was incurring a huge revenue loss by not collecting VAT on spot delivery contracts. The document said, “Spot delivery contracts (SDC) usually concern agriculture commodities. In SDC, goods remain in the custody of commodity exchanges and are traded hundreds of times over and again until the delivery of goods is taken. Every sale of goods is eligible to tax under the VAT Act. But the government is collecting sales tax only on the last purchase which is incorrect and incurring huge losses.” The document mentions that under the new Goods and   (GST) regime   will lose lakhs of crores as compensation in addition to losing tax presently under the VAT Act.” The PAC document added that Gujarat’s advocate general had opined that though derivatives are certainly goods for the purposes of VAT Act, but wanted the court of law to decide on the issue than the department. 
 
 “But even then appellate officer of the commercial tax department set aside the assessment order without approaching the competent court. This was uncalled for,” claimed the then PAC chairman Shaktisinh Gohil.
