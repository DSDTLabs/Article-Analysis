MUMBAI: He created a scene in front of the cops and they couldn’t do a thing to stop him! A sprightly monkey hopped into   police station around 11.30 pm on Thursday and tried afew tricks that left some petrified and many amused for more than an hour.

 Upon arrival, the monkey plonked itself on a bench and played with the cops and people who had come there for work. As people looked on, some scared and other surprised, it clambered onto a table and decided to check the FIR register.
 
 Powai resident   said that people went to take a look at the police station due to the commotion.
 
 A police officer said no one knows from where the monkey emerged. “He suddenly jum- ped onto the shoulder of a complainant before leaping onto a uniformed officer’s shoulder and trying an acrobatic stunt or two... He was a friendly chap; he didn’t hurt anyone,” the officer said.
 
 As people at the police station watched in glee, the simian parked itself on a window sill and stared out of the window for some time.
 
 At 12.30 am, a rickshaw pulled up outside and the monkey darted out and got into the pas- senger seat, forcing the driver out of his vehicle. It sat there for half an hour. After much hesitation, the driver got into his seat, only to be nudged out by the monkey. After much goading by the cops, the driver started the vehicle and dropped his ‘passenger’ at Powai gardens.
 
  confirmed that the monkey did not harm anyone.
