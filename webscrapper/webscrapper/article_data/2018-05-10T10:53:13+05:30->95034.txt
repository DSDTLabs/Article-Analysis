ZIRAKPUR: Even after many accidents in Gazipur because of a few surprise trees in the middle of the road, the civic authorities are yet to decide whether or not to uproot these obstacles.

 On several occasions in the past, commuters on the Gazipur road had a narrow escape when they lost balance of two-wheelers after hitting an open manhole and a grown tree close to each other near Savitry Green-2 apartments. These obstacles have narrowed down the road. Savitry Green-2 resident Manoj Das complained to TOI that an accident on this section recently had snapped the supply of electricity to the area because the poles that appeared in the middle of the road had almost got uprooted.
 
 People from the residential societies around this road said repeated assurances about getting permission to cut the trees had not translated into action. Another problem is that this road is 60-foot wide on the paper but reduced to 20 feet because of a delay in land acquisition. During a visit to the area, the TOI team found another spot where three trees were in the middle of the old   road and had become a cause of many accidents.
 
 S K Vadhawan, executive member of the confederation of welfare bodies of  , said: “Two people died in a major accident on that spot but the civic authorities concerned continued to turn a blind eye to the issue. The residents have raised the issue with them many time but they are yet to take action.” Advocate  , legal secretary of the confederation, said: “At night, the risk of fatal accidents on this stretch multiplies, since the road has is no street light and the driver spot the tree when they are two close to avoid a collision. Even the regular commuters on this road also face similar risks because of abrupt trees.
 
 Mohali deputy commissioner   said she had constituted a joint team of the forest and electricity departments, besides the municipal council, to decide on the issue but, till date, no action had been taken on it.
