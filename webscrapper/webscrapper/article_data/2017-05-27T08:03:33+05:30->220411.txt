He said after the Centre gave principle approval for campuses in Dehra and Dharamshala, state government did not deposit the required money to get environment clearance due to which Government of India has not granted a permission yet.

 Javadekar added that if the present government in the state would not complete the required formalities to set up the permanent campus of Central University, then upcoming BJP would do so.
 
 Union ministry of human resource development in a letter written to state government on November 4 last year had mentioned that north campus of the central university would come up at Jadrangal site (near Dharamshala), which was offered by state government, while earlier site selection committee had identified 80 hectares land at Dehra for the establishment of south campus.
 
  Ministry had requested the state government to obtain forest clearance from Union ministry of environment and forest and hand over the identified land at Dehra and Dharamshala, free from all encumbrances, to central university of Himachal Pradesh for the establishment of a permanent campus.
 
 Central university was allotted to Himachal Pradesh along with 15 other states in 2007. The campus is still being run from the rented premises even after 10 years of its establishment.
