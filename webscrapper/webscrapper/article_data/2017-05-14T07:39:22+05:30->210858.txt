HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad police have cracked several high-profile cases with a little help from CCTV cameras, but the scenario is different in the newly-formed   commissionerate. The city police have close to 30,000 CCTV cameras spread across its jurisdiction, but its eastern counterpart - Rachakonda - which spans over 5,091 square kilometres, has only 900 cameras. 

 Even worse, the cameras that have been set up were put up by colonies and communities as part of the safe city concept. Police are still waiting for the state government to step in and provide funds to buy cameras and other equipment.
 
 The commissionerate officials claim that they were awaiting the government's nod of approval and money to put in place more CCTV cameras in identified pockets like Nagole, LB Nagar and  .
 
 "A survey was conducted to identify strategic locations in the three zones," Rachakonda police commissioner   said, adding that the   scores high on crime rate. 
 
 "If all goes as per plan, the Malkajgiri zone, which has nine police stations, Malkajgiri, Nacharam, Jawaharnagar, Uppal, Medipally, Ghatkesar, Kushaiguda, Jawaharnagar and  , would be covered with CCTV cameras soon," he said.
 
 According to a senior official from the Rachakonda commissionerate's special branch, these cameras would help in bringing down the crime rate considerably.
 
 "The lack of cameras has provided miscreants a sense of confidence that they would not be caught. We can track criminal movement if there are cameras. In the first stage, we will cover the Malkajgiri zone, where there is a spurt in burglaries," he said. After Malkajgiri, the officials plan to put in place more cameras in the LB Nagar zone and then the Bhongir zone. 
 
 "The LB Nagar zone covers several areas, where arterial roads link the state and national highways. If there are cameras along this route, we can monitor movement of vehicles and also control accidents," Bhagwat added.
