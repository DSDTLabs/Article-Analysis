New Delhi: ABVP members once again resorted to violence on Friday. And so did the administration. Not towards those who vandalised office property but a journalist trying to record the happenings for evidence. 

 Some members of the Right-wing students’ party had come to meet the dean of students welfare around 2pm. When they came out, some of them broke flower pots outside the dean’s office. Soon, they were joined by others. 
 
 All this while, a TOI reporter was recording the incident on her cellphone. Deputy proctor   snatched her phone and threatened to lodge an FIR against her. She and the media at large were blamed for the “trouble” in the university though she had come to that office for the first time.
 
 “Who allowed you here?” screamed Alpana at other journalists who had been speaking to officials there about the strike. “There is a media room, why don’t you all sit there? Why must you come to these offices?” she yelled. 
 
 She was joined by deputy proctor   in the screaming act. Others in the office kept quiet even as the two women officials kept on abusing the TOI reporter. 
 
 Our reporter, unnerved by this experience, requested the phone be returned. But Alpana refused to budge. In fact, she ordered that all journalists be removed from her office and taken to a bare “media room”.
 
 About 20 minutes later, this reporter went back to the office to ask for the phone. While handing it over, Alpana said the photograph could have been taken “in a certain way, subtly”.
