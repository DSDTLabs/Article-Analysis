UDAIPUR: The district collector’s open letter addressed to women on Mother's Day urging them to ask their sons to not drive without helmets is moving the hearts of the fairer sex. The officer’s letter has made a major impact, now organizations and voluntary groups have stepped in to spread the message far and wide. Women, specially teachers in various colleges and professionals have vowed not to let their children drive two-wheelers without proper head protection. 

 Collector   on Mother’s Day had taken the opportunity to communicate with women and share his personal experience with them. In the letter, Malick said that he happened to visit a friend’s place to extend condolence on the death of his 19-year-old nephew who died in a   accident. The boy died because he wasn’t wearing a helmet. The collector’s narration was heart-rendering as he said that the boy’s mother was losing consciousness every few minutes while mourning over his body. 
 
 Malick has urged mothers claiming that compared to fathers, mothers are more close to the sons and if they are determined then they won’t allow their sons to drive without helmets. The number of road casualties caused due to reckless driving could be reduced this way. The officer also said that soon a campaign would be started in the district to sensitize riders, specially youths on the importance of wearing a helmet. 
 
 Meanwhile, women specially mothers seem to be touched by the letter. Dr  , assistant professor at the   here said she would hold a lecture soon to sensitize her scholars on the issue. Teaching faculties at the Law college Deepti Sharma, Megha Bhatnagar, Nidhi Bhatnagar and others said students specially boys would be asked to wear helmets compulsorily while coming to college. Housewife and member of many kitty groups   said that the issue would be discussed in the upcoming gathering and mothers would be asked to take promises from sons that they will not drive without helmets.
