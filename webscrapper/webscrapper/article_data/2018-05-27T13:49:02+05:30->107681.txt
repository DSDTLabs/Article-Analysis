DUMKA: Former chief minister and JVM-P president Babulal   came down heavily on the ruling   while addressing a divisional-level tribal conference at the outdoor stadium here on Friday. 

 
 Although the conference was aimed at strengthening the party's support base among the tribals of Santhal Pargana - considered to be a   stronghold - the JVM-P leadership was more vocal against the saffron party than its regional opposition party, JMM. 
 
 "BJP tried its best to make the tribals extinct from the state through its anti-tribal policies introduced by both the central and state governments," Marandi said referring to the Land Acquisition Act and the state government's attempts to amend the tenancy acts.
 
 While explaining the plight of the people who lost their lands to mega projects introduced in the state Marandi said: "So far 30-35 lakh hectares of land were acquired for the purpose and lakhs of tribals and their descendants became traceless."
 
 "This is high time that the BJP should be uprooted from the state. Otherwise, the tribals won't have any option but to become extinct on the false pretext of development which is actually aimed at felicitating industrial houses to exploit our natural resources," Marandi said.
 
 Marandi also accused BJP for "demolishing" the democratic fabric of the constitution and referred to what he termed "highjacking six JVM-P MLAs" to form its government in the state by alluring them with ministerial posts. "Four years have lapsed since the defection of those MLAs and the issue still remains still unanswered," he rued in local Santhali dialect.
 
 Top JMM leadership, including principal general secretary and Podaiyahat MLA Pradip Yadav, MLA Mistry Soren, former MLA Bandhu Tirkey, spokesperson Manjula Murmu, were among others who addressed the large gathering.
