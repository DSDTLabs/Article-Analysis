HUBBALLI: If you violate traffic rules, police won’t fine you but instead make you take an oath that you’ll follow   in future. Police in Hubballi-Dharwad came up with this idea for   to ensure vehicle users obey traffic rules. 

 Traffic police, who usually enforce rules by collecting fines from lawbreakers, are currently busy educating people. If they come across any traffic violation cases like people not wearing helmets, jumping signals, using mobiles while driving, without seat belts, etc, they stop them and convince them to follow traffic rules after making them swear that they will not violate rules under the “Oath to Riders” campaign. Traffic police are targeting major roundabouts, colleges and accident hotspots for this campaign.
 
 Mallikarjun Baladandi, DCP (crime and traffic), said, “To create awareness, especially among youths, we devised this campaign which we hope will change road users. The campaign will continue even after the Road Safety Week which was successfully observed in the twin cities till Monday. We’ll enforce traffic rules by fining errant motorists if we find them breaking rules multiple times.” 
 
 Satish Patil, a college student, said, “It’s a good move. This will help create awareness about traffic rules.”
 
 “When a policeman stopped me for not wearing a helmet, I was afraid of being fined, but to my surprise, it was quite different. The policeman asked me to raise my hand and say, ‘I will wear a helmet from tomorrow and respect traffic rules’,” said Ashok Naik, a private company employee.
 
 Last year, the police commissionerate had carried out a Gandhigiri campaign by handing out flowers to traffic rules violators and appealed to them to follow traffic rules.
