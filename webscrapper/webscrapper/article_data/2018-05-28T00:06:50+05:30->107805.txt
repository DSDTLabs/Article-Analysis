 The decision has been taken by the United Nurses’ Association ( ) as none of the hospital managements have agreed to accept the   declared by the state government.
 
 As per the government decision the new salary structure has to be implemented from May and has to be paid during the first week of June. “Till date none of the managements have agreed to pay the revised salaries. Hence we have decided to wait till the salaries are paid in the first week of June. We will go on strike from the day the salaries are paid,” said Sibi Mukesh of United Nurses’ Association.
 
 Though the government had declared minimum wages as Rs 20,000, at present, most of the hospitals in the district are giving only Rs 13,000. Despite the Supreme Court rejecting the plea of the private managements to reconsider the minimum wages fixed by the government, the managements have not been willing to provide the revised salaries.
 
 “We have not boycotted work till date in any of the hospitals in the district. The functioning of the hospitals was not affected even though we were on agitation. But now we are forced to boycott work since justice is denied to us,’’ said the UNA leaders.
