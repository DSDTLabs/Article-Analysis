NEW DELHI/BENGALURU: The   government on Thursday said it is probing former deputy chief minister R Ashoka’s alleged role in procurement of 143 Tata   buses when BJP was in power. The buses have now been discarded due to poor performance and high operating cost.

 “I have sought the file to examine Ashoka’s involvement,” transport minister H M Revanna said in New Delhi. The issue had come to the government’s notice earlier and even a legislature committee had submitted a report that is gathering dust. “We will share the file details in 8-10 days,” Revanna added.
 
 Interestingly, Revanna’s predecessor and now home minister Ramalinga Reddy had given a clean chit to   in 2015. He had refuted charges of Ashoka’s involvement in the purchase of defective Tata Marcopolo buses at a news conference on January 14. “The transport minister is only the chairman of these corporations. She/he won’t be a technical expert. Decisions are taken based on reports from experts. So it is not proper to blame the minister,” Reddy had said. 
 
 Rajyotsava gift to B’lureans Ashoka had given the air-conditioned buses as a Rajyotsava gift to Bengalureans in 2008. The government then said Tata Marcopolo buses, at Rs 30.49 lakh each, cost about one-third the price of a Volvo bus. The BMTC bought the buses from Tata Marcopolo in 2008 under the   National Urban Renewal Mission, with Rs 16-crore grant from the Union government and Rs 14 crore from the state.
