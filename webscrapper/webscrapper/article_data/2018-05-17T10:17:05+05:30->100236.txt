Gurugram-based   and Deeya Bajaj on Wednesday became the first Indian father-daughter duo to climb  . Twenty-year-old Deeya summitted at 4.30 am on Wednesday, and her father followed 15 minutes later. 

 
 
 
 The duo embarked on the journey to scale the highest peak in the world on April 16, accomplishing the feat in a month's time.
 
 A proud wife and mother,  , who spoke to her family last at 10.30am, said the two were thrilled to be on the top of the world. 
 
 "They were obviously excited and elated. Deeya said they watched the sunrise from the top of the world, and that it was a beautiful experience. For Ajeet, the achievement was all the more special because this time, he was with his daughter," Shirly said. 
 
 After unfurling the Tricolour at top of the Everest, the two mountaineers began their descent and have reached North col (23,030 feet) via camp 3 (27,390 feet).
 
 A   awardee, 53-year-old Ajeet became the first Indian to ski to the North Pole and the   within a year in 2006-2007. Daughter Deeya isn't far behind. Having trained at the Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) in Uttarkashi, she undertook the 20-day-long Trans   at the age of 17, and in 2012, went on to climb Mt Elbrus (5642 m), the highest mountain in Europe. 
 
 When unable to reach them on their cell phones, Shirly said she kept track of their movements through an expedition leader stationed at the Everest base camp at 17,000 feet. As proud as she is of the two of them, she admits being worried while they are on their expeditions, more so for her daughter. 
 
 But, that doesn't let her hold Deeya back. 
 
 "Such an expedition is a way to bring home the point that if given the right opportunities, a girl child can climb any summit," she said. The father-daughter duo are expected to be back in Gurugram by May 20.
