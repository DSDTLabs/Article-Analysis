GURGAON: In an initiative that is likely to alter the home budgets of city residents for good, MCG along with the   will launch several farmer-to-consumer markets across the city.

 In Phase 1, the project will be launched in sectors 43, 45, 46, 47, 51 and 53. These vegetable markets will be run out of portable cabins installed at designated spots within the sectors. Land for these markets will be provided by MCG, and the markets will be arranged by the   board.
 
 “The idea behind the project is to bridge the gap between consumers and farmers. While these markets will let consumers buy vegetables and fruits at cheaper rates, it will fetch a better rate to the farmer, who will be selling directly,” said  , an official of the state marketing board.
 
 He added there is a high demand for fresh produce in New Gurgaon, which is far from the city’s mandis. The two mandis in Khandsa and Sadar are almost inaccessible to people living on the other side of the highway. Consequently, prices of vegetables in these areas are very high, compared to other places.
 
 “We have decided to provide land for 10 markets, possession for six of which has already been allotted,” said Sudhir Singh Chouhan, senior town planner, MCG. Eventually, the plan will be implemented in all sectors across the city. Yadav said they will let farmer organisations run these markets and not give these to individuals, thereby ensuring that farmers can benefit from the project as well.
