Panaji: Call it ill-luck or failure to get its  , the   ( ) just could not get its   to see the light of day.

 It was not just the amphibious bus service that failed to take off. GTDC sources told TOI that the response from people to the hot air balloon service that was launched last season, was not very great. 
 
 Tourism officials, however, are hopeful that it will slowly gain popularity. This joyride was also launched first at Baga beach two years ago, but saw opposition raised by local fishermen and shack operators. The hot air balloon adventure sport facility was then shifted to south Goa. 
 
 During the current season, GTDC, in a tie-up with Pune-based Flying Safari, introduced motorized paragliding at Mandrem beach, in north Goa. 
 
 Soon after the new service was launched, a few foreign visitors raised objections saying the adventure sport was disturbing the serenity of the beach. The tourists, living in Mandrem, had even lodged a complaint with the civic body on the issue.
