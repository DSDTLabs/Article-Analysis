AMRITSAR: Issuance of warrants against a top official of Lahore’s   jail on Wednesday has once again revived the hope of Sarabjit Singh’s family for justice after the Indian prisoner was killed in jail in 2013. But at the same time, the deceased’s kin are resentful that they have not been included in the investigations.

 According to reports, a Lahore court has issued warrants against a jail official after he failed to appear before it in connection with the case. The Additional District and Sessions Judge, Lahore, has also directed the Lahore police chief to ensure the appearance of jail’s deputy superintendent on February 17.
 
 Reacting to the development, Sarabjit’s sister Dalbir Kaur told TOI on Wednesday that, “I am bit satisfied for the fact that at least my brother’s case is being pursued in Pakistan and I can see a ray of hope for justice.”
 
 She, however, regretted that her brother’s murder case was moving at a snail’s pace in Pakistan. She also resented that the one-member judicial commission of Justice  , who investigated the case, never contacted any family member to record their statement.
 
 “I have been demanding time and again to involve us in the investigations, record our statement, but none of us have ever heard from the commission,” said Dalbir, adding that she or any member of Sarabjit’s family was ready to visit Pakistan or Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi to record their statements.
 
 Sarabjit was attacked by two fellow inmates of Kot Lakhpat jail   and Aamir Tamba on April 26, 2013, and was declared brain dead on May 1, 2013. According to the statements of the two accused with the commission, they had confessed of having killed Sarabjit to avenge the killing of innocent people in a bomb blast allegedly carried out by him.
