JAIPUR:   continues to snuff out young lives in the city. On Sunday a 10-year-old boy was killed after a speeding truck ran over him in   of the city.

 The incident took place at 8am when a   was passing through Kanota area, the boy had come out of his house to witness the procession. When sweets were distributed during the procession, the child also went to take sweets. The child was running back to his house with sweets when a truck coming from Jaipur ran over him.
 
 The Kanota police identified the child as  , resident of a nearby village. His father works as an accountant in a nearby brick factory. The local vendors and passers-by rushed the boy to a hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.
 
 A few persons chased the truck which was found abandoned alongside the highway. The Kanota police said they have filed a case against the driver under section 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 304A (causing death by negligence) of the IPC.
 
 Jaipur in particular has seen several deaths due to speeding and overloaded trucks. While the RTO department and the traffic police continue to be at logger heads, the deaths on road continue. A police official told TOI on condition of anonymity that truck drivers in Rajasthan flout every norm in the rule book.
 
 “Bribes on the highway are a regular feature, money changes hands and everything is legitimized. We have seen how ACB arrested a few RTO officials who allowed overloaded truck to enter into the city limits by accepting bribe from truck drivers,’ the official said, adding that truck owners are equally responsible for deaths.
 
 “The truck drivers are often sleep-deprived, under pain and unskilled and hence cause accidents on roads,” the police official said.
