Trichy: Desiya Thenninthiya Nathigal Inaippu Vivasayigal Sangam state president P   has alleged that he has been receiving anonymous phone calls from Tamil Nadu threatening to kill him if he did not call off the ongoing protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi.

 He was speaking to reporters here on Monday on his way back to Delhi after visiting his wife who has been hospitalised. “For the last three days I have received around 500 anonymous calls threatening to kill me by driving a lorry on me if I did not come back to Trichy”, he said.
 
 He accused BJP’s national secretary H Raja of portraying the farmers’ protest in bad light from day one. “H Raja had claimed that I owned an Aadi car, hundreds of acreas of agriculture land, four tractors and unpaid crop loan in various nationalised banks,” he said. “He is abetting the farmers to commit suicide. If anything happens to any of our farmers, H Raja will be the man responsible for that”, he alleged.
 
 He said that he had lodged a complaint with the parliamentary police station in Delhi against the anonymous calls. He was also preparing to lodge another complaint with the Inspector General of Police in Trichy, he added. “However, at any cost our protest will continue till our entire demands are met by both the state and Union governments”, he further said.
