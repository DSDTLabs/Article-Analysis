Jaipur boy Rohit Purohit, who plays Alexander the Great in the TV soap, Porus, was in his hometown recently for a family function. When we caught up with him, Rohit told us, “I was coming home after quite a long time. Since I am part of a daily soap, travelling gets very difficult. But this time, I did not want to miss out as we were having a grand celebration – a party for my father who retired from work. All our relatives and friends were here, so how could I miss it?”

 Rohit took a two-day break to be in town for the celebrations. But the actor had to pay a price for his stardom – he had to oblige his friends and relatives, all of who wanted to click selfies with him. “I was in Jaipur for just two days and I didn’t get much time to be with my family. I had to meet some 400-500 relatives! I was at the party for more the four hours and I was only clicking selfies with everyone!” Rohit told us.
