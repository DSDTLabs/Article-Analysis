SHIMLA: Suspension of 37 leaders for anti-party activities could create troubles for the   in   before the parliamentary elections as majority of those shown the door belong to the Virbhadra Sigh camp. As Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu is the state president and is not having cordial relations with Virbhadra since long, the decision of suspension now can widen the fissures in party’s state unit. Already the suspended leaders have started questioning the decision and announced to approach the party high command on the issue.

 Before the assembly election, Congress president   had announced   as party’s chief ministerial candidate in a rally held in Mandi and now after the election, leaders from the Virbhadra Singh camp are being suspended for anti-party activities.
 
 Sukhu and Virbhadra Singh have not seen eye to eye for a long time now and before the assembly election, Virbhadra Singh had launched a drive for removal of Sukhu from the post of state Congress president, but the high command retained Sukhu though it gave Virbhadra Singh free hand in the election.
 
 Sources said the way Virbhadra loyalists have been shown doors could spell trouble for the party in coming days. At a time when the Congress has announced to launch a campaign against the BJP “Hisab De Sansad-jawab De Sansad”, infighting can spoil the game for the coming parliamentary election.
 
 Many of the suspended leaders have already started questioning Sukhu’s decision and have opened front against him. Virbhadra Singh has considerable clout among voters in Himachal Pradesh as he has remained chief minister for six terms besides winning parliamentary elections from Mandi seat. 
 
 Even his wife Pratibha Singh has been MP from Mandi. Now many senior leaders from Mandi parliamentary seat have been shown the doors and it is likely to cast a shadow in the upcoming elections, sources added.
