RANCHI:   looked pleased as punch as he walked back to the pavilion after having batted five hours and 20 minutes while making a flawless, unbeaten 117 as Australia ended Day One of the third Test against India here.

 “Obviously, we needed a couple of partnerships,“ Smith said at the end of the day's play. “Maxi (Maxwell) played beautifully . Stuck to his plans and struck the bad balls,“ he added. Asked about the pitch, Smith said: “It is a good pitch so we will need all the runs we can get. The bounce was consistent, hasn't really spun, and we will need as many as we can get in the first innings.“
 
 It took Smith 12 Tests to post his maiden century but since the Oval Test against England in 2013, he has made 18 more centuries. Smith's feat prompted former England captain Michael Vaughan to tweet: “I reckon @stevesmith49 is the best player ever to have looked so average at the start of his Test career.“
 
 Incidentally, Smith passed the 5000run mark in Test cricket in the course of his unbeaten knock on Thursday. He is the third fastest Australian to do so after Matthew Hayden and  .
 
 The Australian captain was 76 runs short when he went to the crease and crossed the milestone shortly before the tea break. Smith achieved the feat in his 53rd Test and 97th innings. Hayden had taken 95 innings and Bradman only 56.
 
 He thus beat his bitter-rival Virat Kohli to it. Kohli's tally stands at 4491 in 56 Tests. Smith drew level with the India captain in terms of hundreds in IndiaAustralia Tests. Both now have six hundreds each.
 
 Kohli, however, has scored more runs than Smith in India-Australia Tests.Kohli's tally stands at 1316 runs in 15 Tests while Smith has accumulated 1219 in nine Tests against India.
