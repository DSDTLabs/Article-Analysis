NEW DELHI: A panel headed by finance minister   on Thursday discussed the availability of edible oil in the country and ways to deal with rising imports. While there has been demand from the industry and various segments to raise import duties on edible oil to deal with the situation, the inter-ministerial panel did not take any decision on the issue.

 Sources said a panel headed by the cabinet secretary will deliberate on various strategies that are likely to be adopted. The inter-ministerial panel will again meet to take a final decision. 
 
  minister  , food minister  , agriculture minister   and principal secretary to   Nripendra Mishra and secretaries from various other departments took part in the meeting. 
 
 The government is keen to ensure that farmers do not face the brunt of rising imports and is keen to shield them from any difficulties.
