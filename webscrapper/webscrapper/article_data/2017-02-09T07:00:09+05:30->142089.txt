NAGPUR: ‘Domestic cylinders’, ‘sewing machines’, ‘cup and saucer’, ‘coconuts’ and ‘kites’ were among popular symbols sought by independent candidates contesting the 151 seats of   (NMC) elections, to be held on February 21.

 A large number of rebels cutting across party lines who have jumped into the fray as independents made a beeline at 12 zonal offices to bag these symbols. ‘Cup and saucer’, ‘gas cylinder’, ‘hat,’ ‘cricket bat,’ and ‘road roller’ found a large number of claimants.
 
 According to NMC’s election department officials, there were 48 available symbols, apart from those of the national and regional parties, for the civic body elections. Independents could choose any of these 48 symbols. While filling their nomination forms, candidates had indicated their preference for the symbols.
 
 Sources said that in many wards, rival candidates demanded the same symbol. But in such cases, the issue was resolved through draw of lots. 
 
 Newly formed   claimed to have fielded candidates for 31 seats. It managed to secure the ‘television’ symbol for its candidates. But   was not so lucky. The party, which has fielded four candidates, failed to obtain a common symbol, party convener Nilesh Bhopche said.
 
  rebel candidate and sitting corporator Vishakha Maind got ‘whistle’ as her symbol, Congress rebel Arun Dawre got the ‘Niagara’, while senior sitting Congress corporator Abha Pande, who didn’t seek a party ticket and is contesting from Ward 21 as an Independent, secured ‘domestic cylinder’.
 
 Interestingly, she quit the party as she had contested state assembly polls in 2014 as an independent candidate.
