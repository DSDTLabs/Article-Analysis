KOCHI: The   ( ) is planning to inaugurate its butterfly-shaped restaurant on the airport premises by month-end.

 Currently , there are no food outlets for visitors on the premises of the new international terminal (T3). The nearest is the airport hotel, which is located at the parking facility. The new restaurant is right in front of the new terminal and is shaped like a butterfly in tune with Cial's environmentfriendly initiatives. In fact, Cochin airport is the world's first solarpowered airport.
 
 “For the restaurant, we supplied a significant amount of the building materials in order to reduce the tender quotation, which will also reflect in the pricing of the food at the restaurant,“ said a Cial official.
 
 Departing from the standard notion of overpricing at airport facilities, the new restaurant will provide food at nominal rates. As per Cail's requirements, a set of 10 essential food items will be provided at affordable rates in order to avoid fleecing the airport visitors.
 
 These items include rice meals for Rs 45 and tea for Rs 12. They have also worked out special rates for their 7,500 airport staffers who are not working directly under Cial's payroll. They can avail a rice meal for Rs 5 and a tea for just Rs 2.
 
 “There are many people work ing at Cial--from those earning Rs 5,000 to Rs 2 lakh a month-and it is important to provide them food which suit their budget,“ said the official. Once the new restaurant is opened, the existing airport hotel at the parking is expected to be shut down.
 
 Furthermore, Cial has also issued the tender for new snack bars at the arrival visitor's area and the departure check-in area for the new domestic terminal, which is set to be open by the end of 2017. As per the tender requirements, they are required to serve tea, coffee and   snacks at affordable rates to the visitors.
