 Trichy: The cargo terminal at the Trichy International   has finally received the much awaited new scanner. At a time when the airport is looking to accommodate more international and domestic flights, the new scanner will go a long way in facilitating quick dispatches of consignments, drastically reducing waiting time for traders.
 
 The scanner, worth Rs50lakh, has already been installed in the cargo terminal building. Ever since cargo services were launched at the international airport, consignments have been showing an upward trend. Within a few months, the airport would be able to recover the cost of the equipment through handling charges.
 
 The highest tonnage of cargo handled at the airport was 6500 during the year 2015-16. The 7000 tonne arget for the year 2016-17 financial year was attained well before the end of 2016. So far the terminal has handled 7500 tonnes, said officials. There are 80 carriers that operate from Trichy. Cargo is lifted by Sri Lankan Airlines, Air Asia, Tiger Airways, Air India Express and Malindo Air to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Colombo and Dubai. 
 
 Cargo authorities said that for a long time they had been demanding for an additional scanner because of the huge volumes. D Paulraj of Skyfield Export said that exporters like him had been struggling with one scanner as it increased the transportation time. Since 90 percent of the consignments were of perishable in nature, there was no leeway for delays. Now, both officials and traders can heave a sigh of relief with the new scanner.
 
 According to airport authorities, as some minor work is yet to be completed, the new scanner would be inaugurated shortly.
