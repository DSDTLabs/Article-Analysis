 Imprints 2017, an alumni meet held annually, was recently organized in various cities across India including Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Pune, Kolkata and Hyderabad.
 
 The annual alumni meet aims to discuss the road-map for GIM and identify key areas where alumni can be more engaged with the institute.
 
 Imprints is hosted by the institute, the process of planning and execution is done by the Alumni Chair, Alumni   and the Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC). The Executive Committee consists of a few selected alumni that serve as a link between the institute and the alumni network.
 
 At the meet discussions were held over Skype calls with GIMs Director, Prof. Ajit Parulekar which covered different aspects ranging from how to further strengthen the students’ skills in terms of industry expectations to subjects that can be introduced or modified to keep up with companies’ requirements.
 
 The city meets were attended by prominent alumni in various top positions at leading companies across the country.
 
 GIM hosts a Grand Alumni Meet each year in August at the   campus and many alumni are unable to make it on campus for the Grand Alumni Meet. 
 
 Hosting city meets across all major cities ensures that more alumni can be reached out to and a strong network between alumni and the institute can be created and maintained. These meets in turn facilitate networking amongst the alumni as well as the institute and the alumni. It will also help in creating opportunities for the students to interact with the alumni network.
 
 The Alumni Executive Committee, the Alumni Chair and SARC are planning to extend Imprints internationally in addition to the US meets. Some of the places that Imprints could likely take place next year are Toronto, Hong Kong and London.
