LUCKNOW: Chief minister   took a dig at   president   for his projection as 'janeudhaari pandit' by his partymen and thanked God for transforming the fourth generation of Nehru-Gandhi dynasty. 

 Speaking at the inaugural session of ABVP convention in Lucknow on Monday, Yogi also made an indirect attack on   without naming him by referring that   belongs to the fourth generation of a 'great personality' (read Nehru) who once said that he was a Hindu only by accident of birth.
 
 "Now, they need temple visits more than us. They are going from one temple to another. Now they would not be able to question our visits to temples," Yogi said. The change in their (Rahul) heart has not come in a day. It has come because of the efforts of the organisations like ABVP in making it clear that the core community (Hindu) of the country cannot be ignored any more, he said.
 
 Yogi blamed the Left government in Kerala for recent killing of ABVP worker   and observed a minute's silence to pay homage to the departed soul. 
 
 Stressing on improving the education system and creating a positive atmosphere, Yogi said that ABVP has to improve the atmosphere in universities.
 
 Referring to anti-India slogans on JNU campus, Yogi said, "How can anti-national elements take shelter in our universities?" Yogi also said that government is bringing a law to ensure that private schools don't hike fees in arbitrary manner.
 
 
 
 
 Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that syllabus in schools should have uniformity. “Why UP Secondary Education Board would teach something else and CBSE something else? Why create a situation where a student of UP Board gets confused on seeing CBSE paper. Aur madrassa board ka toh kya kehna (And what to say about Madrassa Board),” Yogi said.
