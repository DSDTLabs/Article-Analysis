Mapusa: The Anjuna police on Monday busted an online prostitution racket at Baga.  Kashmir ‘Ganja’ Singh, 26, a native of Amritsar, Punjab, and Swadesh Mishra, 25, a native of Jharkhand, were arrested in this connection. The police laid a trap and traced Singh near the Baga bridge and rescued one woman who he had intended to push into the flesh trade. Upon interrogation, it was revealed that two women were being kept at the hotel in Baga to be pushed into prostitution, both of whom the police rescued. Singh’s accomplice, Mishra, was subsequently arrested. Anjuna police inspector C L Patil said the duo resided in a rented room at Siolim and had been operating the prostitution business themselves. “The accused lived in a separate location, while they kept the girls in different hotels in a bid to hoodwink the police,” he said.
