Ongole:   N Chandrababu   stressed on Thursday that it was essential for the   to win the next election from a historical point of view, calling upon the people to oppose the BJP for the injustice meted out to the state.

 “The Centre should grant funds to the state not out of mercy but as a matter of right for the state,” the CM said while addressing a public meeting in Kandukur after attending programmes initiated under the Neeru-Pragathi scheme in the constituency on Thursday.
 
 Naidu appealed to the people to teach a befitting lesson to all those hatching conspiracies against the state and the TDP.
 
 The CM said the people should be careful to identify the manner in which conspiracies were being hatched against the state. “We are not surviving at the mercy of the Centre. We can tide over the odds with our commitment and dedication,” Naidu said to huge applause from the crowds. 
 
 The CM alleged that some corrupt people were making baseless allegations against him only with a view to erode his popularity. He said he would never be cowed down by baseless accusations as he has dedicated his life for the overall development of the state. “People who served jail terms on corruption charges are roaming around the state and running malicious campaign against me,” he said in an attack on YSRC chief Jaganmohan Reddy, albeit without naming him.
 
 Naidu said opposition leaders are trying to politicise even accidents. He explained that he was there in Devipatnam village while consoling the kin of the boat mishap victims and personally monitored the rescue operations throughout the day. He said the government had also announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh to the bereaved family members. The opposition leaders who did not even   the bereaved families are making allegations against the government, the CM said.
