LUCKNOW: A day after his meeting with   national president Amit Shah, Suheldev Bhartiya Samaj Party chief and cabinet minister   is an assuaged man, ready to vote for BJP's ninth Rajya Sabha candidate  , who has been pitted against SP-backed   candidate Bhim Rao Ambedkar. 

 Rajbhar, who had threatened to abstain from voting in the RS elections in protest against "being ignored" by the BJP dispensation in UP, made a sharp U-turn on Wednesday, saying that despite being approached by the SP and BSP to vote for their common candidate, he would stand with the BJP with whom his party is in alliance. 
 
 Earlier in the day, Rajbhar held a meeting with three other MLAs of his party and conveyed the BJP chief's instructions to them to vote for Agarwal. He later attended a dinner hosted by CM   at his official residence.
 
 A month ago, Rajbhar had raised the hackles of the ruling BJP government, accusing it of being corrupt and failing on the law and order front. 
 
 The   chief had later fielded candidates against BJP in the local bodies elections also.
