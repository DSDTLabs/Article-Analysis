Kolkata: Private hospitals will have to share information of their   patients with the KMC so that the civic body can take up a comprehensive   control programme, especially in areas reporting such cases more frequently than others.

 The KMC health department on Thursday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Tuberculosis Health Action Learning Initiative (THALI), a project funded by United States Agency for International Development ( ). THALI is now the KMC’s strategic partner in its endeavor to combat the rising threat of the disease in Kolkata, on the lines of the health ministry’s   (RNTCP).
 
 Expressing concern over the large number of deaths reported due to TB, member, mayor-in-council Atin   said from now, the KMC health department would pay as much attention to the TB control project as it did for malaria and dengue. “It is worrying that an average of five persons die of TB in Kolkata every day. We need to start a war against this dreaded disease by spreading awareness at strategic locations, especially slums,” Ghosh said.
 
 On signing the MoU, project director of THALI, Milan Dinda said the project’s main aim was to create awareness among patients and ensure that they completed the treatment, thereby lowering the risk of contracting drug-resistant TB.
