NEW DELHI: A day after a 30-year-old   was found murdered at her house in Sriniwaspuri in south Delhi, police are   a few mobile numbers from which she had been receiving   for the past few days. 

 Officers were also trying to track down a woman and a youth who had been visiting the victim. Police recovered a set of diaries having some phone numbers beside the body. Officers were scanning the diaries to identify the callers. 
 
 The woman had apparently kept a note of some of the numbers from which she used to receive the calls and also wrote something in codes beside each of the numbers. Officers were also trying to decode the notes.
 
 The role of a youth, who often visited the apartment, was also being probed. It was found that the youth had been visiting the woman frequently for the past one week. While questioning the family members police also came to know that the woman was worried about her finances and had once spoken about returning some money to a creditor.
 
 Police sources said that the autopsy of the woman revealed that she had been stabbed several times on her neck, after which the killer had also slit her wrist to ensure she died. The killer also tore off her earrings and other jewellery that she was wearing to make it look like a robbery incident. However, police found the other valuables kept at her house intact. 
 
 Officers have not ruled out the possibility of the killer being infatuated with the woman. The nature of injuries on the woman suggested that the killer might have been holding a grudge against her.
 
 Meanwhile, while scanning the victimâ€™s mobile phone police also found some photographs of her with a few people whom her family members could not identify. Officers are also trying to trace these people. 
 
 Senior police officers say that they have zeroed in on some people, including the youth who has been evading calls from the cops. The district special staff has been roped in to probe the matter as well.
