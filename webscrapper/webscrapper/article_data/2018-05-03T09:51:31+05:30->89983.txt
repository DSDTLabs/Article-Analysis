NEW DELHI: That they are the country's first line of defence along the border with China is an indisputable fact, but that jawans from the   ( ) can sing like top professionals is an astonishing revelation.

 
 A video tweeted by the ITBP shows a group of jawans - a mini orchestra, really - playing and singing the song 'Allah ke Bande', from the 2006 Hindi film 'Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part II'. And listening to them will give one goose bumps, that's how good they are.
 
  
  
 
 
 These brave jawans form a specialised mountain force, and they are deployed on border guarding duties from the Karakoram Pass in   to Jachep La in   Pradesh. They cover as much as 3,488 km of the India-China border. 
 
 The border outposts along that 3,000-plus km border range are all high-altitude - they range from 9,000 feet to 18,700 feet in the western, middle and eastern sectors of the Indo-China Border, according to the ITBP's official web site.
 
 Most ITBP personnel are professionally trained mountaineers and skiers. The work in beautiful country, as the photos below show, but the climate and terrain can be brutal. 
 
  
  
 
 Given the conditions they operate under, in addition to guarding duties, ITBP personnel are also the first responders during a natural disaster. Since their formation in 1962, the ITBP has carried out numerous rescue and relief operations across the country.
