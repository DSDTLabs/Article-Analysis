Last weekend saw the producers of the   and Saba Qamar-starrer 'Hindi Medium' winning the award for the Best Film (Popular) at the 63rd Jio   2018, and Irrfan taking home the trophy for the Best Actor-Male (Popular). Now, the two producers —   and   — have decided to take their association a step further with a multiple-project deal, the first being 'Arjun Patiala', a buddy cop comedy starring   and Diljit Dosanjh in lead roles. The film also features Varun Sharma. 
Both the producers are committed to telling engaging stories with good content, as seen in last year’s success, Hindi Medium. Speaking about renewing their partnership, Bhushan, the head honcho of T-Series, says, “We have similar ideologies when it comes to music and we are like-minded in many aspects. I relate to the kind of content he makes, so we decided to come together for a larger association, as our partnership on 'Hindi Medium' proved to be extremely fruitful for both of us.”
 
 On his part, Dinesh adds, “It’s so encouraging to get this award (Best Film) because it reinforces our long-standing belief at Maddock Films that taking risks will finally pay off. With 'Hindi Medium', it’s great to see that good content has emerged a winner. Bhushan and I share a productive partnership, but what excites me the most is our line-up for 2018. It’s a promising and exhilarating mix of diverse films.”
