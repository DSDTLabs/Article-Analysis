 Vivek Desai, managing trustee of Navajivan Trust, said that their aim is to take the Mahatma to the children. “We don’t want to confine the Mahatma in education to a mere few chapters here and there in textbooks. As we are approaching Mahatma’s 150th birth anniversary, we decided to take a step to build the bridge with the student community through the examination. The students will learn about the formative years of the Mahatma in his own words,” he said.
 
 While   Vidyapith conducts exams for students based on Mahatma Gandhi’s life, it is Navajivan’s first foray into the activity. So far, the trust founded by Mahatma Gandhi used to conduct similar examinations for the inmates of state prisons.
 
 Desai said that they are directly approaching schools for the activity instead of a uniform large-scale examination for better coordination and impact. “Our effort is to encourage students to understand the Mahatma’s basic life philosophy and witness his journey — especially in Gujarat. A few other states have already taken similar initiatives. There is no compulsion on the students to appear for the exam,” he said, adding that the Gandhian institutes have to work to promote Gandhi’s philosophy in his 150th birth anniversary year.
