NEW DELHI:   have recovered from a forgettable last season and in a remarkable fashion booked a place in the final of the Indian Premier League 2017 where they clash with two-time champions Mumbai Indians on Sunday night.

 Former India captain  , who had earlier expressed his disappointment at the sacking of   as the Pune Supergiant skipper, feels that the wicketkeeper batsman is in such a form that he can lead them to a maiden title in what will be their second and final season. 
 
 "I think Pune will win. The playoff they won against Mumbai will be a big confidence booster. Ben Stokes will be missed though. But the way Dhoni is playing with those 40 runs he got in the last two overs, he can help them win the final," he was quoted as saying India Today on Sunday.
 
 Dhoni has so far scored 280 runs in 15 matches this season including an unbeaten fifty. It was his late assault against Mumbai Indians in the Qualifier 1 that helped Pune Supergiant post 162 which proved to be a winning one. 
 Azhar said Dhoni, who in the last nine IPL seasons has played as a captain, will be itching to win the trophy as a player for the first time. "Dhoni has always won as captain. Now he may want to win as a player. Try to prove that I can win even when I am just a player," he said.
 
 Azhar also believes that Dhoni's positive relationship with current captain   has proven beneficial for Pune and it has helped the franchise perform well this year. "Once you are not a captain, you move on. I was not in favour of his sacking. But now Smith and Dhoni have created a good rapport. They have gelled well that's when the team has delivered," he said.
