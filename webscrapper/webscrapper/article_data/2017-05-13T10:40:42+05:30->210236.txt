BHUBANESWAR: Touted as the   in  , the   here on Friday convicted some of the key accused in separate scams involving   (NDCS) and   (RTIL). 

 The court sentenced RTIL's MD Maloy Guha to four years of rigorous imprisonment and awarded three years of jail term each to directors Malay Haldar, Tirtha Haldar, Dipankar Ghosh and Prosenjit Sil. 
 
 They were arrested just five months ago. Last week the accused, who were arrested on December 7, 2016, confessed their offence in the court, leading to the speedy conviction, CBI sources said. RTIL allegedly cheated investors of nearly Rs 100 crore in Odisha and other states. 
 
 Meanwhile, NDCS's managing director Anjan Baliyarsingh was sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and asked to deposit Rs 10 crore in the court's treasury. Baliyarsingh had pleaded guilty in the court a few days ago.
 
 The NDCS scam exposed political nexus as the CBI arrested BJD's Mayurbhanj MP Rama Chandra Hansdah, party's ex-MLA Subarna Naik and BJP's former MLA Hitesh Bagartti on November 4, 2014, for allegedly embezzling public deposits. 
 
 The three politicians, who are still behind bars, had held post of directors in the company for a few months. Besides, two other directors, namely Kartikeya Parida and Pradeep Patnaik, were also arrested. "We have enough evidence to prove their criminal culpability in the court. They will also be convicted," said a CBI officer. 
 
 The CBI's chargesheet against the six NDCS accused said the company duped investors of more than Rs 8.34 crore. But investors alleged NDCS, floated in August 2011, collected more than Rs 100 crore from the public by promising high interest rates.
