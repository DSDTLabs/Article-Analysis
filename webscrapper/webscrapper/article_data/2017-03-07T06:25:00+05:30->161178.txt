 “Fresh western disturbances have developed over Jammu and Kashmir. Judging by the wind pattern, we can say that it is advancing towards the northeast and will bringing with it a considerable amount of moisture. The movement of the system is likely to cast its effect on   and cause cloud cover over large part of the state. Besides thunder showers, few parts can experience hailstorm within this time,”said Binay Mondal, chief weather scientist of IMD Ranchi.

 Mondal said the daytime temperatures across the state will remain higher by 2.5°C on an average in the next two days. It is worth mention that IMD in its long range forecast early this month, had predicted that the summer temperature will remain above normal this year in most parts of the country, which also includes Jharkhand.
