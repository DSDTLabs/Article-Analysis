With so many Sandalwood actresses making inroads into Kollywood,   says that the scene is great. “It is excellent for them as even a Kannadiga watches Tamil films. All said and done, Tamil films pose competition to   films in  . At the time of release, we consider our release date if a huge Tamil film is releasing. And that’s because   films has a huge market outside of the state, too. So, Kannada actresses getting opportunities outside of their industry is only good for them. They get good opportunities and the films have a better reach as well. Also, the kind of roles they are offered here is great and challenging,” she points out. 

 Bengaluru girls like Sanchita Shetty, Nanditaswetha, Parvatii Nair, Shraddha Srinath, and most recently, Kirik   girl Samyuktha Hegde signing a film opposite Prabhudheva, the number of actresses doing Tamil films here is increasing. “Samyuktha’s offer is great. Dance is her strength and she would be doing a film with the God of dance in regional cinema! I am sure that’s every young actor’s dream. Shraddha, too, is doing some great films here. The scene is good,” she says.
