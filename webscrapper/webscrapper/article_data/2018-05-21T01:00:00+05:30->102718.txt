It’s a dream for anyone to buy a home in a city like Mumbai. About 18 months ago,   had bought a three-and-a-half bedroom apartment in Andheri. However, due to a busy schedule, the actress wasn’t able to furnish it. Recently, after wrapping up work on her film Manmarziyaan, she took off to   with her sister Shagun to collect unique décor items for the  . 

 The girls travelled across cities like Barcelona, Seville, Madrid and Valencia. In a bid to make her pad look different,   picked artefacts by local artisans from the cities that they visited. Shagun is now in-charge of decorating the house with some professional assistance. Taapsee is likely to move into the house by the end of this month. 
 
 The actress tells us,“The theme of my house is shabby chic, a style born in Europe. So, when I was doing the interiors of the house, I felt the best way to do the décor is to get stuff from Europe itself and make the house look unique. Even though it required an insane amount of walking around during the Spain trip and dragging huge bags along, it was all worth it! All the things I managed to get there, won’t be available here and they will surely make the home look the way I want it.”
