Not many would know that actress   had played the role of a girl from   (DRC) in her   Chashme Buddoor (1981). That is why when she was invited to DRC recently, all those memories came rushing back to the actress. The Film and   society of the college organised a film festival to celebrate the work of the actress, and after a lot of persuasion, Deepti finally agreed to attend the festival. The event started with her speech and was concluded with a screening of Do Paise Ki Dhoop, Chaar Aane Ki Baarish. Overwhelmed to be at the college, Deepti said, "It is so nice to be here, it is wonderful to see your work reflect through young minds and it is really awesome. I am quite overwhelmed, I want to thank everyone sitting here, including the students, for giving me this opportunity. I wasn’t very sure of how this would be organized because I thought that I am not that focused, and I do different things. I was also a little nervous, ki kaisa hoga. I asked them, ‘Do you have this, Do you have that?’ But the college authorities said, 'Humare paas sab hai, aap bass aa jayiye.' I am so happy to be here. It reminds me of the time when we shot for   in Delhi. I am going to cherish this day all through my life."
