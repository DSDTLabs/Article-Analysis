The songs have registered a huge number of hits online.” 
 Applauding his composers, the director adds, “The soundtrack is a collaboration of many talents — Amaal Mallik, Tanishk Bagchi and Akhil Sachdeva. We’re overwhelmed with the response the soundtrack has received. We hope that the music will add to the popularity of the film.”
