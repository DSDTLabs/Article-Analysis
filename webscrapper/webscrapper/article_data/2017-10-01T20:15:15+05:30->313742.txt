  Agra: The administration has directed the basic education department to hold salaries of teachers who had skipped pre-election duty (survey) in September. About 52 basic education teachers will not get their salaries for the month of October as they either didn’t attend pre-election duty or failed to collect stationery for the survey duty assigned by the local administration ahead of the forthcoming municipal elections.    Talking to TOI, sub-divisional magistrate of Sadar tehsil, Shyam Lata Aanad, said, “We have sent a letter to the BSA (basic shiksha adhikari) directing him to hold one month's salary of 52 teachers who had either failed to take part in pre-election duty or they didn’t receive the stationery (voters list, forms, etc) from their supervisors.”    Protesting against the order, the teachers' association claimed that the assigned duties are against the Right to Education Act.    “The duty letter prepared on September 13 asked teachers to start their duties from September 11, and most of the teachers got this order letter around September 25. How it is possible to finish 20 days' survey in just seven days, of which four days holidays. Moreover, it is is clearly mentioned in the Right to Education Act that no teacher can be deployed in any form of non-teaching work except certain duties such as Census, disaster relief duties and local or state level elections. This survey doesn’t comes under any of these exceptional duties mentioned in the Act,” said Brajesh Dixit, general secretary of UP primary teachers association.    Dixit said that if salaries of teachers are withheld, the association will approach the high court.
