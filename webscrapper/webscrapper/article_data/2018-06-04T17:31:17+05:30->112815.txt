LUCKNOW: At least two persons were feared dead while several were left injured following a massive blast inside a house in   police circle. The incident took place on   about 40 kilometers from state capital Lucknow on Monday.

 
 As per initial reports, the blast was so powerful that the echo of it was heard by locals in the radius of 500 meters. The two- storied house turned into debris. The adjoining houses were also affected in the incident. 
 
 Police personnel from Kakori police station are on the spot while rescue operation is underway. 
 
 While the cops remained tight lipped over the incident, it was alleged that the occupant of the house was running a small cracker factory inside it and the blast was a result of fire into the explosives. The possibility of a cooking gas cylinder catching fire was also being explored. 
 
 Sources said that the blast was too big for a cracker factory and therefore, a probe by special agencies may be initiated.
