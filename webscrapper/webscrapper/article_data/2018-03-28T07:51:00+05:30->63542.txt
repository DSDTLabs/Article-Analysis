CHANDIGARH : The   issue rocked the Punjab assembly budget session on Tuesday after the ruling   MLAs raised objections on the allegations leveled by leader of the Opposition Sukhpal Singh Khaira on their involvement in the illegal activity.

 After the Congress MLAs created uproar in the assembly, the parliamentary affairs minister made a request to speaker   to mark an inquiry into the matter. The speaker said he would examine the issue.
 
 Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Khaira said he stood by his statement and whatever he has said was inside the   on Monday and was recorded in the assembly proceedings. He denied having spoken to media persons on the issue outside the assembly.
 
 When Khaira named former power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh in the mining issue, the latter objected to his comments which resulted into altercation between both the leaders.
 
 Later, chief minister Amarinder Singh attacked Khaira for “misleading the assembly just to attract media attention”. He was responding to Khaira’s statement that the state government was about to refund Rs 29 crore of earnest money to bidders in the illegal mining case.
 
 The chief minister said the assembly would be informed about the case once the findings into the illegal mining case were received. After Khaira stated that the government was also planning to return money to contractor   involved in irrigation scam, the CM said the probe into the irrigation scam was also in progress and once its report comes, it would be made public.
 
 Local bodies’ minister   also attacked Khaira and demanded that privilege motion should be brought against him as he had spoken about the legislators outside the assembly. This was followed by a heated exchange of words between Sidhu and Khaira.
 
 The assembly speaker had to expunge various remarks made by the legislators during the ruckus inside the House on the mining issue. Later, AAP MLAs also staged a walkout from the House.
