HYDERABAD: On ‘Hevalambi Nama Samvatsaram’,   will witness good rains followed by a bumper harvest and all-round development. However, the state should be vigilant against terror activity between October and December and also be prepared for cyclones between August and October.

 These were predictions by Pandit Santosh Kumar Sastry at the new year almanac reading event held at Pragathi Bhavan on  . Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his cabinet colleagues were present at the event on Wednesday. Sastry said six of the nine planets are positively placed for Telangana, but predicted a slowdown in the information technology sector as well as a threat to a senior politician.
 
 Banking on a bumper harvest prediction,   said Telangana is all set to become number one state in the country. He said the state has already achieved 21% growth in several sectors and is set to become the top-performing state in the country. 
 
 “I checked with my chief secretary, finance secretary and advisors who reviewed state’s growth after TRS came to power. On an average, the state achieved 15% growth, which is commendable as no other state has been able to come closer. With this year’s almanac also giving positive signals, there will be no looking back and Telangana will become the number one state,” said KCR.
 
 IAS and IPS officers who served in previous governments in united   are performing ‘extraordinarily’, he said. He pointed out that 3,500 industries have set up units in Telangana by investing Rs 50,000 crore and providing 2 lakh jobs after the government liberalized its industrial policy.
 
 The CM told home minister N Narsimha Reddy and city police commissioner M Mahender Reddy to be vigilant in the wake of ‘trouble’ indicated in the Almanac towards year-end. He also requested people to be vigilant to thwart terror designs.
