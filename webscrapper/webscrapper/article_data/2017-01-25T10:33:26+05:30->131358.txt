 Apprehending arrest, Soumendra had filed anticipatory bail plea in the high court. "We argued in the court that my client owns the gas agency for last two decades and there has never been any complaint against him. His records are completely clean. As the case is not of serious nature, we prayed court to allow our anticipatory bail plea and the court granted us relief," said Soumendra's counsel Dharanidhar Nayak. Shortfall of cylinders in his warehouse does not state that our client has committed any offence," added his counsel.
 
 Besides Soumendra, police have registered a criminal case against his agency manager  , his warehouse in-charge Nilu Sahu and one Debraj Panda.
