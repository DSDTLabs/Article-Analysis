PUNE: The local crime branch of the Pune rural police on Wednesday arrested five women and a man in connection with the   at a jewellery shop in   on February 4. A minor girl who was accompanying the women when the theft took place has been detained. 

 The gang had made away with 480gm of gold and silver ornaments, worth Rs 12 lakh, from the shop. The police have recovered 1.8 kg of silver ornaments and 13 cellphones, collectively worth Rs 2 lakh, from the gang. 
 
 A team led by inspector Dayanand Gawade arrested the suspects from Chakan. All the women are from Surat in Gujarat. Gawade said after receiving the complaint, the police had sent out images of the women which were captured by a   camera. The pictures were sent across district through a mobile messaging service. “We received a tip-off that the women were seen begging in Chakan. Then, with the help of the Chakan police, we laid a trap and arrested all of them,” Gawade added.
 
 Earlier on February 4, the suspects had entered the Maharaja Jewellers Shop located at   near Loni Kalbhor, about 20 km from here. Jeweller Ritesh Rawal’s son and some employees were in the shop as Rawal was visiting Pune to make some purchases. “Once inside the shop, the gang started demanding money from Rawal’s son. One of the women then picked up a quarrel with another woman in the shop, following which the jeweller’s son and the employees told them to leave the place,” Gawade said.
 
 Taking advantage of the commotion, one of the women picked a box from the bag which was kept behind the counter. Soon, others stopped quarrelling and left the shop,” Gawade said.
 
 “The theft came to light later while Rawal was checking the CCTV footage. We suspect the women to be involved in more such cases,” Gawade said.
