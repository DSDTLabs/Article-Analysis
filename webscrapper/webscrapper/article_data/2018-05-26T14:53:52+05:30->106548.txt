NAGPUR: For nearly a minute today, the Sun will be exactly overhead at noon and will not cast a shadow of an object on the ground. This will be observed at 12.10pm. Friday will be the first   of the year. The second such day will be witnessed on July 17 at 12.20pm.

  Centre will be demonstrating the concept of zero shadow for its visitors. “We will be keeping few objects in the out. A couple of experiments will also be conducted. We will be inviting members for the programme, and everyone else is also welcome,” said director N Ramdas  .
 
 There are two zero shadow days every year in May and July, observed in places that lie between tropic of cancer and tropic of Capricorn. While zero shadow can be clearly observed in May, it may not be clearly visible in June owing to rains and cloudy weather, said Iyer.
 
 This phenomenon lasts for a small part of a second, but the effect can be seen for a minute to a minute-and-a-half.
