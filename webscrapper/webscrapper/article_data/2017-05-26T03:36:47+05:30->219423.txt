JEWAR: Nahobat (75), a resident of   village, became an accidental victim and eyewitness of the murder and gang rape that played out in the early hours of Thursday.

 Recounting the horror, the elderly man told TOI he was half awake in his shack around 1.30am when a Maruti Eeco came and halted near him. “Two of the car’s tyres to the right side were punctured. The occupants of the car came and sat on my cot. They then called up someone and asked them to fetch a spare tyre,” Nahobat said.
 
 The next thing Nahobat saw was six men making an appearance and manhandling the stranded car’s occupants, including the women. “They started pulling and shoving them and snatched the car key from the driver. They then drove the car into the field and took me along with them. They hit me with a metal rod when I requested them to let us go after taking away all our valuables. They tied all of us up with the women’s dupattas,” he said.
 
 At that point, the criminals started to take the women aside, and when one of the victims resisted, they put a gun to his head and threatened to kill him. “They repeatedly told him to given them all the money he had. They fired one shot in the ground when the victim resisted and finally shot him in the chest after holding the gun to his head for nearly 15 minutes,” Nahobat said. The criminals then took the women aside in the open field one by one. “I do not know if they were raped and could not see anything as it was very dark. While this was going on, two men stood guard around the others. One of them said if more money was not given to them, they would kill us all. From their dialect, it appeared they were not locals,” he said. “After some time, we heard police vehicles on the road. Hearing the sirens, the criminals fled. The cops untied us but the man who was shot had died by then,” Nahobat said.
