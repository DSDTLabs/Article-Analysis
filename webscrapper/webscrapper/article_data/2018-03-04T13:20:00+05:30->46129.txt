PONDA: The streets of Ponda town resounded with the music of the ‘dhol’, drums and conches as huge effigies of wondrous colour and light effects paraded their way on Saturday evening.

 Though thousands of spectators thronged to witness the artistic talents, the festivities, for the first time, saw speeches by guests. Governor   inaugurated the parade by ceremonially offering ‘shriphal’ (coconut) in the presence of PWD minister and shigmo committee chairman Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar, South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar, Ponda municipal council chief officer   and others.
 
 ‘Antruj Mahal’- as Ponda was called in ancient times is known for its Shigmo and folk art festivals. The state Shigmo festivities kick off from Ponda. Though the parade started about an hour late, spectators patiently waited along the roadside.
 
 The fancy dress contestants kept the crowd hooked. Artiste Vijay Desai as Lord Hanuman, the Romttamell and folk dance troupes drew appreciation from the crowds. Later, the floats thrilled the crowds with a spectacular display of Hindu mythology. This year’s parade also saw an increase in participation from floats, Romtamell groups, folk dance troupes and fancy dress contestants.
