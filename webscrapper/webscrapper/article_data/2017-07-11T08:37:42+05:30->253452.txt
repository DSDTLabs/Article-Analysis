 It is for the first time in last 29 years that a lioness has given birth to cubs at Jaipur zoo. The pure Asiatic lioness at Nahargarh Biological Park who was brought from Junagarh gave birth to five cubs. While one was a stillbirth, one more extremely weak cub did not survive. Now the remaining three cubs are about 1.5-month old. So far, no one is being allowed to go close to them and they would be put for public display only after a month or so. Now with the lioness, the three cubs and a pure lion, the prospects of visualising a 'lion safari' is possible.
 
 Tejika in the past was shown documentaries of cats bringing up their cubs in forests of South Africa and Gujarat's Gir National Park to teach her about motherhood. The forest department officials had put up an LED TV and were showing documentaries on how lions behave around their cubs in the wild. The six-year-old Tejika was brought to Jaipur from Gujarat nearly one and a half years ago.
