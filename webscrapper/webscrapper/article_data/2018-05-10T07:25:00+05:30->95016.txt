Chandigarh: Nominated   of the Chandigarh MC have gone from all-powerful to toothless in a matter of nine months, with the UT administration’s latest decision to not allow them to be members of the civic body’s sub-committees.

 Before this, in August last year, the Punjab and Haryana high court had annulled their voting rights for mayoral elections. Later, the Supreme Court upheld this decision in February. The administration’s latest decision means nominated councillors will not be a part of any of the MC’s 14 sub-committees, which have powers to spend anything between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 55 lakh, and can take decisions on subjects ranging from roads and water to electricity and city beautification. 
 
 Till last year, each of the nine nominated councillors was a member of at least one sub-committee. Before the court annulled their voting rights, nominated councillors were considered game-changers in the civic body’s election of the mayor, making their roles just as crucial as that of their elected counterparts.
 
 They were also playing a crucial role in the MC’s finance and contracts committee (F&CC), which is the most powerful after the general house and has financial powers of up to Rs 50 lakh.
 
 Until July 2017, as they made up for nine of the total 35 councillor votes in mayoral elections, nominated councillors wielded such influence that the mayor and others in the MC house had to keep them in good humour through the year and even make them heads of sub-committees. Things had come to such a pass with these councilors that even Union ministers had to visit them for mayoral elections.

 ‘UT decision will strengthen democracy’
 
 Satinder Singh, the BJP leader who went to court to get the voting rights of councilors annulled last year, said the UT administration’s decision to not include nominated councillors in sub-committees of the MC would “strengthen democracy in the MC”. “The move will also end horse trading,” he said.
