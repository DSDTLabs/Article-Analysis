PUNE: The   currently being acquired by the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) would initially be operated on the Hinjewadi and  .
Passengers would have the option to choose between  .
 
 A senior official with the transport body told TOI that in the first phase, around 50 to 100 buses will ply to Hinjewadi and   by mid-February or March. “The air-conditioned buses will be standard 12m long with approximately 40 seats in each. Discussion on the fare structure is currently on,“ the official said.
 
 “If the Hinjewadi route consists of a total of 10 buses, with each arriving at stops at a gap of around 15 minutes, one bus will be an AC bus while the next bus will be non-AC. The system has been developed so that passengers have more options,“ the official said.
 
 Passengers, however, were of two minds. “Since these buses are set to be air-conditioned, they will need more maintenance and fuel. PMPML can increase the fares. It must concentrate on improving the existing fleet. The condition of many buses is pathetic and one should take care of those buses,“ Angikesh Sarath, who lives near Kothrud, said.
