Pune: The fugitive rape accused, Akshay Lonare (21), was re-arrested on Sunday night after he escaped from Sassoon General Hospital in the morning. A team from unit (III) of the crime branch, led by inspector Sitaram More, took Lonare back into custody from Uruli Kanchan. He was handed over to the Bund Garden police for probe. Deputy commissioner of police (crime) Pankaj Dahane said Lonare, a resident of Kondhwa, had his roots in Uruli Kanchan. “Constable Anil Ghadge received a tip-off that Lonare was in Uruli Kanchan. Our team rushed there and took him into custody after a chase,” Dahane said. Inspector More said Lonare took Rs20 from an unknown person after escaping from the hospital and went to Kondhwa sharing an autorickshaw. “He then borrowed Rs500 from a friend in Kondhwa and went to Hadapsar by bus. Then he went to Uruli Kanchan,” More said. Lonare was arrested in 2015 for raping a minor. He was languishing in the Yerawada Central Prison from then. On October 18, he was admitted to the hospital for the treatment of a psychiatric disorder. Four guards from the police headquarters were deployed near Lonare’s bed. On Sunday morning, two of the guards stepped out to have a cup of tea and another went to the washroom. The guard present near Lonare locked his handcuff to the bed. Noticing that the guard’s attention was not towards him, Lonare managed to pull out his hand from the handcuff and escaped. A senior officer of the city police said, “An inquiry has been initiated again the four policemen on guard duty at the hospital on Sunday morning.”
