HYDERABAD: TDP MP M   stirred a hornet’s nest by claiming that the day is not far off when   will declare itself as a separate country.

 A video of the press conference of the MP in   during an official function on February 12 went viral on Thursday, soon after the two TDP mantris quit the   cabinet.
 “Don’t force the five south Indian states to declare freedom as a separate country,” Muralimohan warned.
 
 “There is a feeling in the south that it is being neglected,” he said.
 
 The 77-year-old actor is now trolled by netizens as many took objection to his utterances and wondered as to how a ‘responsible’ MP can speak like that and get away.
