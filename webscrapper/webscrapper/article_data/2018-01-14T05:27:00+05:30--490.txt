NEW DELHI:   questioned the government as to why  , principal secretary to the PM, turned up at Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra’s residence on Saturday, a day after four senior-most judges of the apex court raised serious issues against him over “selective” case allocation. 

 Latching on to TV visuals, AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala tweeted: “As PM’s principal secretary, Nripendra Misra visits CJI's residence at 5, Krishna Menon Marg; PM must answer the reason for sending this special messenger to Chief Justice of India.”
 
 Official sources said Misra had not met the CJI. They said Misra had gone to greet him in the New Year, but returned as the CJI was not available. Sources in the CJI’s office also said that no meeting took place between the two. TV visuals showed Misra driving to the residence of the CJI and leaving after a while from the gate. 
 
 The development came a day after Justice J Chelameswar along with three other senior-most   judges took on   over allocation of cases to benches and some recent orders which, they said, created “doubts” about the integrity of the top court.
