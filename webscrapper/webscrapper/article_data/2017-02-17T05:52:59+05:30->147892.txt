NASHIK:   city president   has informed the election commission that the money taken from the party candidates contesting the civic polls would be shown in the poll expenses incurred by the party.

 The election department had sought an explanation from Sanap after a video went viral showing a BJP clerk demanding Rs 2 lakh from an aspirant keen to contest the polls on a BJP ticket. Later, the party had clarified that all candidates selected to contest polls are supposed to give that amount for the party’s campaign expenses. 
 
 Sharing the details of the response given by Sanap, regional secretary of BJP Lakshman Savji said Sanap has informed the election commission that the BJP will provide all details of expenditure by the candidates and the party within the stipulated time. 
 
 “We had carried out a survey after screening the aspirants and deciding on candidatures. We have given tickets accordingly and the money was taken after the finalizing the candidature,” Savji said.
 
 An   official responsible to check violations of the model code of conduct in the civic polls confirmed that they had received the written reply from the party that they had taken money but it will be used for party-related work. 
 
 After the video clipping had come to the fore, BJP office-bearers justified that Rs 2 lakh was be taken from the selected candidates only to be pooled in for the party funds, which will be spent the candidates’ campaigning. 
 
 The amount is included and accounted for in the candidates expenditure – which is Rs 8 lakh per candidate, the party officer-bearers had then said.
