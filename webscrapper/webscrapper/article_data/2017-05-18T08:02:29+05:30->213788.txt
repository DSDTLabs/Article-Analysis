BENGALURU: Cops interrogating   corporator V Nagaraj alias Naga visited his house in Srirampura, north Bengaluru, on Wednesday and came across   containing   and other details of   and historysheeters. 

 Naga and his two sons, Gandhi and Shastri, also rowdysheeters, had accompanied police for the seven-hour search that began in the morning.
 
 Police said Naga had disclosed the place where he hid all the black money in the form of banned currency notes. However, no fresh cash recovery was made on Wednesday. "During probe, Naga had said that he has more black money hidden in the house. So we carried out a search operation. But he now says his wife, who is absconding, might have shifted the money elsewhere or burnt them down," said police sources. Naga and his two sons were arrested on May 11 from their hideout in Arcot, Tamil Nadu. They had been evading arrest since police raided their Srirampura house on April 14 and recovered Rs 14.8 crore in demonetized notes.
 
 Interestingly, Naga still keeps a telephone diary. "We suspect that he isn't used to mobile phone and its operation. He uses a diary that can accommodate about 150 names. The diary which we recovered has telephone numbers, addresses and other details of other historysheeters and criminals in the city," added sources.
