KOLHAPUR:   (DLSA) has scheduled   on February 11 to resolve cases pending in the court.

 Lok adalat is considered an effective way to resolve disputes through discussions.
 
 DLSA has appealed the litigants to take advantage of Lok adalat and resolve their legal issues. Lok adalat is expecting to settle around 10,000 cases. They are seeking help from lawyers across the district.
 
 Last year, the lawyers had boycotted Lok adalat and the turnout of cases that were resolved was less.
 
 Secretary of DLSA, U J More, said, “Justice is the basic right of the litigants. We will be setting up panels of lawyers and a judge to resolve these cases. The initiative will help to reduce the inconvenience caused to people resulting in loss of money and time.”
 
 More said, “With an aim of justice for all,   is constituted under Legal Service Authority Act, 1987. Under this act, there is provision in Article 39-A of the Constitution of India where Lok Adalat’s can settle disputes and provide free legal services to the weaker section to the society.
 
 He added, “The award passed by Lok Adalat is equivalent to the decree of a   and is not appealable. The litigants have to file application in court or can approach the Legal Services Institutions to present the matters.”
