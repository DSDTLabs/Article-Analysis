KOLKATA: A 65-year-old woman was on Friday night shot dead at her home in   when she was alone at home. The victim was the mother-in-law of Barnali  , Trinamool councillor of ward No. 6 in Madhyamgram Municipality.

 Sourses said the killer may have climbed 20ft down a drainpipe, sneaked into the house, sprayed a drug to render   unconscious. The person then reportedly shot her twice with a gun equipped with a silencer. The councillor and her husband Tarun were not at home at the time of the incident. Her youngest son Jiten was also absent. Dipali, who received wounds in her forehead and stomach, was taken to a hospital where she was declared brought dead.
 
 Jiten’s wife Chaitali isn’t staying at the Biswas residence and has filed for divorce. Suspecting their involvement in the murder, the family lodged an FIR against Jiten’s in-laws.
 
 Police, however, suspect that the assailant was someone from outside the family who came to know about the nearly empty house.
