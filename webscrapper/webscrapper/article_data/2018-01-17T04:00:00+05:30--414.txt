Mumbai:   has agreed not to denigrate Hindustan Unilever’s soap brands and business through its advertisements. Patanjali signed a consent decree with   to this effect, which was recorded by the Bombay high court last week.

 In September 2017, HUL had dragged Patanjali to court over a series of advertisements which the maker of   and   soaps felt were disparaging. The Patanjali ads played on the names of Lux,  , Lifebuoy and  , while asking consumers to reject “chemical-based soaps” and adopt “natural” ones. HUL moved the Bombay HC and obtained an ex parte injunction which restrained Patanjali from telecasting the ads.
 
 The order on the consent decree was passed on January 11 by Justice S J Kathawalla and the matter was disposed. HUL executive director (legal & corporate affairs) Dev Bajpai said: “After an injunction order was passed in September last year, Patanjali had approached us for a settlement. The offer from their end was no different from what the court had already ordered in September. We have now agreed to a consent order only after it has been agreed by Patanjali for a permanent injunction on the advertisement in question and any other ad of a similar nature and, more importantly, on agreeing to a perpetual restraint from disparaging or denigrating our products or our business.”
 
 Patanjali Ayurved executives did not respond to TOI’s calls and messages.
 
 Nearly half of the Rs 15,000-crore toilet soaps market is controlled by HUL. Patanjali has been a disrupter in the FMCG space, with some of its brands like   toothpaste gaining popularity.
