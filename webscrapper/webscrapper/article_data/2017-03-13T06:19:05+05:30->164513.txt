ALLAGADDA:   is a name that needs no introduction in the faction-ridden political scene of   district. He rose to prominence at an early age and grabbed national attention when he took on then prime minister P V Narasimha Rao in the   elections in 1996. Although Reddy lost by a slender margin, he took revenge against the   by winning the by-election that same year by defeating veteran leader Rangaiah Naidu with a record magin. 

 A native of   village in Dornepadu mandal of Kurnool, Bhuma’s entry into politics had all the trappings of a Tollywood potboiler. He had dreamt of becoming a doctor after completing Intermediate in Chennai, but returned to his hometown to help lead the faction after his father Bali Reddy was murdered by rivals. 
 
 He first became   (PACS) president and then mandal parishad president. He won the assembly by-election after the death of his brother Sekhara Reddy in 1992. He repeated the success in 1996 on the back of strong following in Allagadda and Nandyal. Nagi Reddy also married Sobha, daughter of veteran politician S V Subba Reddy, braving the latter’s opposition.
 
 Bhuma was with TDP for long, but switched to Praja Rajyam in 2009. The couple later joined YSRC. Sobha’s death in 2014 hit him hard, forcing him to undergo a bypass surgery. Last year, he returned to TDP.
