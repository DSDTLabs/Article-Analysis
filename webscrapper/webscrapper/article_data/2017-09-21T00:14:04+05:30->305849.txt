Tirupur: A 35-year-old man, who tried to break open an ATM to get money for boozing, was caught red-handed on Tuesday.

 K Sivasankaran, a native of Thoothukudi, had settled in the dollar city a decade ago, police said. 
 
 “A bachelor, Sivasankaran was working as a tailor in a garment manufacturing unit. He was addicted to alcohol and used to stay with a group of friends. But, for the past few months, he had been staying on the streets and used to spend his salary on booze. 
 
 As he was irregular at work, his employer used to pay him a part of his weekly salary on Sunday and the other on Monday to make sure that he turns up for work on Monday. Sivasankaran was frustrated over the arrangement as he could not spend much money to buy alcohol,” a police officer said.
 
 On Tuesday night, passers-by noticed him trying to break open the ATM of a nationalised bank. They caught him and informed police. He was arrested later.
 
 Anupparpalayam police have registered a case.
