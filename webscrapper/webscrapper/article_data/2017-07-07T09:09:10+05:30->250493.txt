JAMSHEDPUR: A 32-year-old man allegedly killed   over   at   in   under   on Thursday. 

 The man, identified as Sudarshan Makur, hacked to death his elder brother Gurucharan Makur (45), sister in-law Bimla Makur (40), and his niece Alochana Makur (13) when they were asleep. Makur's nephew, 15-year-old Rajesh, survived the attack with grave injuries and was admitted to the Tata Main Hospital (TMH) in Jamshedpur in a critical condition. 
 
 Police have arrested Sudarshan and seized the weapon used in the crime while he was on his way to surrender. 
 
 Rajesh told police that he woke up from his sleep when he heard cries of his parents. He narrated that before he could realise anything Sudarshan attacked him too, but he somehow ran from the spot and reached a neighbour's house. 
 
 "On hearing loud knocks on our door we opened it to find Rajesh standing outside with his clothes stained in blood. Rajesh narrated the incident and we rushed to his house to find the distressing scene," said a woman who lives in the neighbourhood. 
 
 "Preliminary probe indicates property dispute but detailed investigation will reveal the motive behind the crime," Musaboni DSP Ajit Kumar Vimal said. 
 
 Sudarshan, too, sustained injuries and was undergoing treatment at the TMH.
