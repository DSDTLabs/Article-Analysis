TIRUNELVELI: More than 20,000 birds belonging to 45 colourful species were spotted by enthusiasts in the bird count in   district on Wednesday and Thursday. These birds had mostly camped close to tanks across the district that were well fed by the rains in November and December.

 Koonthankulam, Kaadankulam, Silaiyam, Thirumalapuram, Thuththikulam, Kodankulam, Tanarkulam, Vijayanarayanam, Piraancheri and Thiruppudaimarudhur were among the main pockets that were flocked with thousands of birds. An interesting aspect of the survey was a flock of greater flamingos at Vijayanarayanam tank near  .
 
 Pelicans, bar-headed goose, black-winged stilt, white ibis, black ibis and glossy ibis, shoveler, garganey, painted stork, median egret, cormorant, spot-billed duck, pintail duck and spoon bills were among the winged beauties that were spotted by the birding enthusiasts and forest department personnel.
 
 In 2016, during the same season there were hardly any migratory birds due to the failure of monsoon. Though volunteers expressed joy at the spotting of the birds after two years, they also expressed concern over the use of fireworks to chase those that were perched close to the tanks.
 
 One of the volunteers, S   observed that this disturbing act was by those who had got the right to engage in fresh water fishing in those waterbodies. He said that those people saw the birds as their competitors as the migratory guests feasted on big fish, which would fetch the fishermen good money.
 
 “Deliberate use of fireworks to terrorise birds at the tanks in Vijayanarayanam, Silaiyam and   has affected the number of birds coming to the Koonthankulam bird sanctuary,” lamented Raja, who is also a resident of Koonthankulam.
