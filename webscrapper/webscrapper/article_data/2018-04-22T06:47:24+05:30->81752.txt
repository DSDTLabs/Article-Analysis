BENGALURU: An alleged case of bribery against a high-ranking official of the social welfare department took a strange turn when a false affidavit, bearing the forged signature of the complainant, surfaced. The affidavit wanted the case closed against the welfare department official.

 After CV  , the complainant from   town, told   ( ) officials that the affidavit wasn’t his, a criminal case was registered earlier this week and an investigation was launched to find out who was behind the false affidavit.
 
 Kumar, a vegetables dealer, had bagged a contract to supply vegetables to hostels run by the social welfare department. In February last year, he approached ACB officers claiming  , the then deputy director of social welfare department, Chikkaballapur district, was demanding a bribe to clear his bills.
 
 The ACB laid a trap and Subramanya was reportedly caught red-handed taking a bribe on Feburary 15 last year. Earlier this week, Kumar received a summons, asking him to appear before Shiva  , police inspector, ACB, Chikkaballapur.
 
 When he got there, Malavaiah showed him the false affidavit. Police said the affidavit had arrived at the ACB office through post and   paper was purchased in Kumar’s name. A local advocate in Chikkaballapur had notarized the affidavit.
 
 When Kumar denied the affidavit was hit, Malavaiah advised him to file a case with the jurisdictional police. Kumar registered a case with the Chikkaballapur town police station requesting police to find out who was behind the false affidavit.
