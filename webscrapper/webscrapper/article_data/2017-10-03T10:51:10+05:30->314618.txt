CHENNAI: Expressing no-confidence on the court-appointed   in the alleged multi-crore beach   case, which was suo motu taken up by the  , a mining firm, which is a party to the case approached the court to discharge the amicus, on the ground that he might be pursuing an agenda of his own, at the behest of the company’s business rivals. 

 The plea has been moved by a Thirunelveli-based mining company, Trans World Garnet against amicus curiae advocate V Suresh.
 
 “The amicus may be pursuing a motivated agenda of his own and at the behest of business rivals of the petitioner and the supporting respondents inimical to their vital interests, rather than assisting the court in arriving at a balanced conclusion in the matter based on a fair, proper and judicious adjudication thereof to the satisfaction of all concerned parties," the firm said.
 
 The company further alleged that Suresh and his wife had earlier appeared as advocate on record for a “henchman" of its business rival Indian Garnet Sand Company. Pointing out that Suresh was also the editor of a magazine published by Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), the petitioner alleged, “Motivated and genetically engineered articles have been published about beach sand mining activities in  , Tuticorin and Kanyakumari districts unleashing a vicious campaign of calumny and vilification aimed at the petitioner and the supporting respondents."
 
 Recalling the circumstance in which the amicus was appointed, the petitioner said, “This court had initially contemplated appointing another counsel as the amicus, but one of the other counsels appearing in the matter, pointed out that the proposed amicus had made representations on behalf of Devadoss, owner of Indian Garnet Sand Company, in the matter and could not therefore effectively discharge his functions as amicus. It was in these circumstances that Suresh came to be appointed as the amicus. Had Suresh stated that he and his wife were the counsels on record for V Sundaram a henchman of Devadoss, we would have staunchly opposed his appointment."
