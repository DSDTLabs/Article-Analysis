CHENNAI: A two-day-old boy was found in the bushes near the   bypass road in   on Monday morning. The umbilical cord from the child’s body was not properly cut.

 Some of the residents noticed the child after they heard his cries. After wrapping the child in a towel, they called the police. A patrol team sent the baby in an ambulance to the government hospital in Chromepet. After first-aid, the boy was taken to the   (ICHH) in Egmore.
 
 Doctors said the child was malnourished as he didn’t get mother’s milk. The doctors have kept the child under observation. The city police personnel have registered a case and are on the lookout for the person who abandoned the child.
 
 There was no CCTV camera to monitor movements of people on the stretch. Meanwhile, police personnel have conducted inquiries with primary health centres and corporation maternity hospitals, besides private hospitals on recent deliveries. 
 
 Investigating officers informed child helpline officials and child welfare committee officials about the rescue.   officials will soon send a team of child helpline volunteers to enrol the child at a government-run orphanage in the city.
