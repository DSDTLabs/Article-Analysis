NEW DELHI: Two   calls since Sunday about a bomb being placed at the passport office near   have sent central   into a tizzy. In both cases, the calls were made from public booths. The caller(s) inserted their own   card in the handset, investigations revealed. The   were bought on forged documents and ID cards of two housewives were used. Cops suspect that a disgruntled person whose passport may have been rejected could be behind the calls.

 Police sources said the first call, received on Sunday evening, was tracked to Seelampur in northeast Delhi. The call came from a number, *****3413. It was found to be registered in the name of a woman, a housewife. She denied having any knowledge about a SIM card being issued in her name. A case was registered on the basis of her complaint. Tracking the location from where the call was made, police reached a PCO booth nearby. When questioned, the booth owner, Giasuddin, could not give a satisfactory reply and was arrested. 
 
 Even as the probe continued, a similar call was received. This call came from another number, ******808. The caller was traced to an illegal PCO booth near Gandhi Nagar. Again, the SIM card was found to be registered to a woman. Police are now looking for a person named Fukran who was present at the shop when the call was made.
