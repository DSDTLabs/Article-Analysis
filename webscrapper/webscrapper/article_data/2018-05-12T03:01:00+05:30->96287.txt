Panaji: In a quick rebuttal to health minister Vishwajit Rane’s statement that three Congress MLAs would meet BJP President Amit Shah when he arrives in the state on Sunday, the Congress said that all its MLAs were united and that Vishwajit’s statement was nothing but a malicious rumour aimed at creating confusion. “The BJP is spreading rumours. All 16 Congress MLAs are united,” opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar said.  State Congress president Girish Chodankar took a dig at Rane saying that the MLAs who could be bought by the BJP had already left the party.  Chodankar also questioned Shah’s real motive behind visiting Goa. “As per Vishwajit’s statement, it looks like Shah is coming MLA shopping.” tnn
