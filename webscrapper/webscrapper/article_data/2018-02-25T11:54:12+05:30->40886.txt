MANGALURU: A law college in   reportedly asked a student not to attend classes for 15 days after he allegedly put up an Instagram status ‘Bundle Raaje #Amit_Shah’ during the   chief ’s recent visit.

 However, on Saturday, after an apology from the student, the   management decided to allow him in class from Monday.
 
 Amit   had participated at an interaction with students of the institute during his visit to the district on Tuesday. College principal K G   said the matter has been amicably settled after a discussion between the management and parents. “What the student did was against the management’s policy. Amit Shah’s programme was organised by our management and he speaking ill about it was not accepted. Therefore, we had asked him to go on leave so that the issue didn’t escalate further,” the principal said, adding the student has apologized.
 
 The Instagram post by Thomas (name changed) had grabbed several eyeballs. Sources said Thomas had also uploaded a clip of Shah, along with the hashtag.
 
 Following severe criticism, he was asked to delete the post, but Thomas refused. He even allegedly retorted that he should have written more on the BJP national chief. Thomas’ father confirmed that the college management had asked his son not to attend classes for 15 days, but refrained from suspending him officially.
