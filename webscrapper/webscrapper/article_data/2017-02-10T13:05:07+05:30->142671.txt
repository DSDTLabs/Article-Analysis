After establishing the hermitage, he installed three idols of Shree Ram-Seeta and Laxman. During the tenure of 9th chief pontiff Shrimad Laxminarayan Teerth, renovation of the hermitage was undertaken in 1703 AD. Yet another renovation was made in the year 1810 during the tenure of 17th chief pontiff Srimad Anand Teerth Swamiji. A gold-plated ‘shikhar kalash’ was erected on top of Shree Ram temple.
  
  After 155 years, the 22nd chief pontiff in the mutt tradition, Shree Dwarkanath Teerth Swamiji undertook another renovation and re-established the idols of Shree Ram-Seeta and Laxman.
  
  This day marks the 51st anniversary of the re-installation of the idols of Shree Ram-Seeta and Laxman.
  
  Thousands of devotees and followers of the mutt from across Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra and   are attending the event.
