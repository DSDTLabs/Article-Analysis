AGRA/FIROZABAD: Samajwadi Party   from   and his son   have been booked for allegedly abducting a Dalit woman zila panchayat member on March 2. 

 The woman, a resident of a village under   police jurisdiction, and her father have been missing since the day of Holi.
 
 In an FIR filed by the woman's uncle, it has been alleged that Hariom, Vijay Pratap and 10 unidentified people took the woman with them in an SUV to celebrate Holi, but she never returned. When her father went to the MLA's house to find his daughter's whereabouts, he too didn't return. 
 
 " We have no idea where my brother and his daughter are. Their phones are switched off. I tried to talk to the MLA's men, but they said they did not know anything. On March 2, the MLA himself came to our house and took my niece with him. Later, my brother went to the MLA's house, but never returned," the girl's uncle said. 
 
  Pachokhara police booked   and Vijay Pratap on Thursday under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement) and 364 (kidnapping or abducting in order to murder) of IPC and sections of the SC/ST Act. 
 
  The woman zila panchayat member supported Vijay Pratap in 2015 for the post of zila panchayat chairperson. In July 2016, the MLA's son lost his post after 33 zila panchayat members, including the missing woman, withdrew their support. 
 
 V ijay Pratap is wanted in an attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy case filed against him and six other men including his father Hariom in 2015 by one Rajeev Kumar, who contested zila panchayat chairperson election against him. Hariom surrendered in the case and was jailed on March 5.
