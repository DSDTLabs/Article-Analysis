RAJKOT: The standing committee of   (RMC) on Thursday rejected the hike proposed in   for non-residential units and vehicles in the budget for the year 2017-18. It, however, approved the budget proposed by RMC commissioner   by adding a few new schemes.

 Pani had proposed Rs 2,519 crore budget last month with emphasis on ‘Resurgent Rajkot’ and focus on 'Green and clean Rajkot'.
 
 The RMC commissioner had proposed increase in   on four-wheelers from existing 1% to 1.5%. He had also proposed to increase water tax from current Rs 1,680 to Rs 2,400 for non-residential properties. 
 
 However, the standing committee rejected the proposed hike in taxes. It also rejected the proposal to increase door- to-door garbage collection fees from present Rs 2 per day to Rs 2.50 per day in non-residential areas. The committee added some schemes and approved Rs 2,537.35 crore budget.
 
 “We have rejected the tax proposals keeping in view people’s worry and added some new schemes to meet people’s aspiration. A ‘one-time settlement scheme’ was launched for those people who have not paid taxes since many years. The scheme offers rebate on interest on tax. We will switch to new carpet area based tax collection from next financial year and before that we want to recover the dues under the old tax system,” said Pushkar Patel, chairman, RMC standing committee.
 
 The new schemes added by the standing committee includes free bus rides for women during festivals like Rakshabandhan and Bhai Beej as well as Diwali carnival.
