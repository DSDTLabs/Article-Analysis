PANAJI: A surprise visit by the mamlatdar of Tiswadi and other officials in a boat along the state’s biggest khazan belt indicated the damage to sluice gates and breached bunds in the Carambolim-Neura stretch on Thursday. 

 By setting sail from the Captain of ports jetty, the boat with mamlatdar   was shown the state of bunds along the   canal by the khazan action committee (KAC). The visit was based on KAC’s complaint. 
 
 A majority of the sluice gates are damaged and a huge breach was noticed to the Dongzo khazan bund of Mandur/Carambolim, which has led to influx of saline water and thus submerging the entire khazan belt.
 
 The latest inspection by officials was unusual, as none had been carried out in the recent past using a boat. “The mamlatdar was shocked to see the damage to sluice gates with the flap doors open,” a KAC member said. “Despite keeping the auction of all sluice gates in the area pending, fishing nets are being illegally cast,” a KAC member said.
 
 Ramrao Wagh, convenor of KAC, Dasharath  , secretary KAC and Ajit Bacal, sarpanch of Azossim-Mandur and  , sarpanch of   panchayat accompanied the officials.
 
 The khazan area being vast, the fertile paddy fields in Carambolim, Azossim, Dongorim, Mandur and Neura and even Agasaim, though less affected by flooding, provided hundreds of farmers their livelihood. But they have been submerged for a couple of decades due to breaching of bunds in a dubious manner.
