Targeting 10% growth over the next five years, the   Adityanath government’s maiden  , presented on Tuesday, focused on farmers and the rural population. The targeted growth is well above India’s projected growth — 7.2% for 2017-18, according to the  .

 The Rs 3.84 lakh crore budget — 10.9% bigger than the previous one — provides Rs 36,000 crore for the farm loan waiver scheme announced by the CM just after taking charge. The government claimed it could arrange for funds for the scheme by checking extravagance and without compromising fiscal discipline. The fiscal deficit of Rs 42,967.86 crore, which is 2.97% of the gross state domestic product, is well below the target of 3% set under the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.
 
 Delivering the budget speech in the presence of Yogi, state finance minister Rajesh Agarwal said the CM had a long-term vision for the development of the state with an eye on the welfare of the poor, women, weaker sections, farmers, and overall progress of the state. “Our budget represents the aspiration of the 22 crore people of UP,” Yogi later said.
 
 While it has gone into overdrive to make provisions for farmers and the rural sector, the pressure to fund the loan waiver scheme has forced the government to drop many welfare schemes of the previous government, say financial experts. So, Agarwal’s budget is mum on the laptop scheme, Kanya Vidyadhan and pension scheme.
 
 Besides, there is no mention of the Purvanchal Expressway though the BJP government has endorsed the project through a Cabinet decision. The government had also promised to link Bundelkhand with Delhi but has made no provision for it; it expects the Centre to chip in to make it happen. The government has claimed that it has introduced new schemes worth Rs 55,000 crore in the budget, but as much as Rs 36,000 crore out of this amount is earmarked for farmers’ debt redemption; that leaves the government with Rs 19,000 crore for new schemes.
