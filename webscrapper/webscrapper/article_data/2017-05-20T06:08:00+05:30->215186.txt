GREATER NOIDA: A delegation of Yamuna Expressway Residents’ Welfare Association (YERWA) on Friday met chairman of  ,  , to lodge a protest against its decision to reduce the   allotted to nearly  ,300 people. According to  , the move would be extremely unfair to allottees who have been patiently waiting for years to get the plots.

 Speaking to TOI, Safal Suri, president,  , said that YEIDA launched the residential scheme in 2009. “At least 21,000 allottees were promised possession of their plots in sectors 18 and 20 in 2013. However, instead of handing over possession, YEIDA is now talking about reducing the size of plots measuring 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 square meters allotted to us,” he said. 
 
 “YERWA expects that a prestigious body like YEIDA will honour its promises to its allottees. While YEIDA is already overburdened with cases filed by farmers, the move to unilaterally downsize allotted plot sizes will open up a new wave of litigation,” Suri said.
 
 YEIDA had allotted 1,250 plots of 1,000 square meters, 300 plots of 2,000 square meters and 125 plots of 4,000 square meters in 2009. 
 
 “We have given owners of these plots an offer to convert their allotment to 50% and reduce it by half,” said Prabhat Kumar. “We have not made it compulsory but allottees can opt for the offer and they can surrender half of their land back to YEIDA,” he said. “We have put this on offer because YEIDA has not been able to acquire enough land in sectors 18 and 20 of the scheme. The additional land resulting from reducing plot sizes will enable us to give possession to more allottees,” he explained. 
 
 “However, we will reconsider the proposal and get back to the allottees within a week or ten days,” he said.
