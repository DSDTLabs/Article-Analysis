Surat: Thousands of textile traders in the city will participate in a ‘sadbuddhi hawan’ being organized by Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA) to protest against central government’s indifferent behaviour to their Goods and Services Tax (GST) demands on September 28. 

 FOSTTA office-bearers said traders in all the 165 textile markets located on Ring Road, Sahara Darwaja and Salabatpura are cursing the GST as their business has gone down by almost 70 per cent in the last two months. Not a single demand put forth by the traders has been accepted in the GST Council. 
 
 Sources said the textile traders have unanimously decided not to put up illumination on the market buildings ahead of Diwali festival. FOSTTA president Manoj Agarwal said, “The GST has put the traders in deep trouble. The business turnover has decreased by almost 70 per cent in the last two months. Through the ‘sadbuddhi hawan’, we will try to send the message to the government that traders are in deep trouble and they want the almighty to intervene to resolve the GST issues.”
