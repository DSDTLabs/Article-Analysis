MALAPPURAM: A message displayed on the table of   (42), a lower division clerk at   grama   office, will give you a different view on public service at government office. The message displayed on a small sheet of paper reads: The government pays me Rs 811 each day for offering adequate service to the public at the grama panchayat office. If you are unsatisfied, you should definitely bring it to my notice. The notice has been on display since 2014. 

 Salim, whose left leg is almost paralysed, said that he put up the board after people offered him money/gift for doing his duties such as field visits and licence granting procedures. "The notice is a strong message to the public that the staff at a government office has to provide proper service to visitors without accepting favours. This message seeks to end the practice of bribes," he said, adding that his mobile number too was included in the note so that people could contact him for help or advice.
 
 Panchayat secretary   admitted that the message has become a hit as it sends out a strong message on duties and responsibilities of a public servant. The Ramapuram native, who joined the office as a permanent employee in 2013, said that he amended his salary in the note when he received a hike. 
 
 He added that the notice went viral on social media recently after a visitor posted a photo of the notice on Facebook. Earlier in 1999, he had worked here for six months as a temporary staff.
