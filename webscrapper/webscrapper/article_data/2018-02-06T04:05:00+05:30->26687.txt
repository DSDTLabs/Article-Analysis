Vadodara: Unable to recover large amounts pending towards providing fire fighting and rescue services in areas both in and outside the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) jurisdiction, the fire and emergency services department of the civic body is looking to write off the bills.

 The department has moved a proposal in this regard to the standing committee of the civic body. However, with VMC in a tight financial situation, the standing committee is in no hurry to take a call and will do so only after examining the details carefully.
 
 The fire brigade provides various services apart from fire fighting. A bulk of this work includes that of rescue operations during floods, bringing people stranded in lifts and other places to safety and also providing ambulances whenever needed. In case of natural calamities too, the fire personnel are sent to places outside the city and even outside the district.
 
 The total amount due towards such services over the last decade now amounts to over Rs 57.7lakh. The officials looking to the accounts of local self-government bodies have also suggested that the amount due till the financial year 2016-17 should be written off.
 
 After this meeting, the department had prepared a proposal and tabled it before the standing committee. Sources said that the committee has discussed the issue, but many members felt that the amounts due from commercial properties or industries should not be written off. At the other end, the committee is not averse to writing off the amounts due from residential properties.
 
 Sources said that a bulk of amount due for work done outside the city and district remained pending. The department has in the past issued notices and even made phone calls to recover the pending amount, but to no avail. The amount has only been increasing since the year 2014-15.
