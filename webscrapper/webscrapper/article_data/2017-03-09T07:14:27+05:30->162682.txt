GHAZIABAD: The GDA is seeking help from   to draw up an environment management plan for the city. The civic agency recently signed an MoU with IIT-Roorkee that requires it to draw up a comprehensive plan and suggest ways to deal with the problem of pollution in the city.

 The move came after the NGT, while hearing a petition filed by   Welfare Association (KARWA), had asked the civic agency to work out a durable solution to the problem.
 
 “Last week we signed an MoU with IIT-Roorkee to prepare a comprehensive plan on ways to deal with air and noise pollution in the city,” Istiaq Ahmed, chief architect and town planner of GDA, said, adding, “Apart from pollution, the institute has also been asked to prepare a plan for solid waste management plan, which is a festering sore in the city.”
 
 IIT-Roorkee was selected after screening seven premier institutes including IIT-Delhi, IIT-Kanpur and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, Nagpur. “A sum of Rs 50 lakh has been paid by the GDA for the work which will be completed in six months and shortly a team from IIT-Roorkee will visit the city for a survey,” Ahmed said.
 
 When it is ready, the plan will be binding on all agencies like GMC, pollution board and housing board to comply with the suggested remedies.
 
 Vinay Kumar Mittal of KARWA, who had filed the petition, said the move was welcome but the challenge would be its implementation. “Kaushambi is a major pollution-prone zone owing to the presence of two interstate bus depots — Anand Vihar ISBT and UPSRTC Bus Stand — state highway SH-27, NH-24 and Sahibabad Industrial Area and Patparganj Industrial Area. It remains to be seen how the recommendations by IIT-Rorkee play out.”
