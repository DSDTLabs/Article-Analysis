THANE: While the state forest department's house   is still in its nascent stage, many Thane denizens seem to have taken up the responsibility of similar projects in their own societies.

 From making nests and placing them in niches in their societies to sourcing   and tying them up on trees, residents of Laxmi Narayan Residency , Vedant Complex, Neelkanth Heights,  , etc. are leaving no stone unturned in their attempt to bring back the depleting house sparrow species in their backyards.
 
 Anil Arora, secretary of  , the first to initiate this project in the city a few months ago, said, “In one of our society get-togethers some months ago, one of the residents pointed out that while our front yards were always filled with the chirping of sparrows, these birds are rarely seen now despite us living so close to the forest. We immediately decided to do something about it. We made a WhatsApp group and came up with this initiative.“
 
 As the initiative gained momentum with many residents coming together to refill the grains in the feeder or keep track of the condition of the nests, the residents of the neighbouring societies decided to replicate this project.
 
 “The children in our society are active in a number of nature and environmental conservation activities and when we heard about this one, they were more than eager to set up these sparrow feeders.Last week around 25 children spent the whole Sunday filling bird feeders we had purchased with jawar, bajra and other grains, and tying them on the trees,“ said Navin Augustine, a Neelkanth Heights resident.
 
 On seeing a slight rise in the numbers of these birds, these residents are even changing their   to further help the project.
