MUMBAI: Breaking his silence on the   scam, former   governor   said the central bank, during his tenure, had asked lenders to take action on vulnerabilities in their operation of the  . The RBI had also sent a list of bank frauds to the Prime Minister’s Office seeking joint action by banking investigators and enforcement authorities. Rajan, however, did not elaborate which Prime Minister the list was sent to nor if there was any action taken.

 “When a way is discovered ... for example, with the SWIFT system it was the problem at Bangladesh Bank which unearthed the problems that were there. When the problem is discovered, it is important that the regulators send the message to the banks that we have unearthed this problem, now fix it in your systems. If they haven’t, we have to understand why the banks didn’t,” Rajan said in an interview to CNBC TV18. 
 
 SWIFT provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about transactions in a secure, standardised and reliable environment. 
 
 On frauds, Rajan said the RBI’s main concern was that even after scams are unearthed, culprits are never brought to book. “We said we need to bring together all the people involved both in unearthing as well as investigating and see how we can move forward. So, we sent a list of the big frauds to the Prime Minister’s Office to try and get some action on that.”
 
 Rajan said that the PNB fraud threw up several questions: Why was this letter of undertaking (LoU) given? Why was it not recorded in the banking system? Did management take notice of it? Was it put before the board? And, of course, after that did auditors pick it up? If not, why didn’t they pick it up as auditors go branch by branch? Were the regulators’ instructions obeyed over time or were they not? And, why were they not obeyed? He added that since the owner in this case was the government, which appoints board members as well as the management, another question is what is their culpability in the whole thing? 
 
 Rajan also said that guarantees received a cavalier treatment in India — whether it is a bank-given guarantee or a government-given one. “We don’t think these are real. It is only when they are called upon by the entity that has relied on them, we understand it is almost like giving a loan or, in fact more, because it is usually called upon when the loan is in distress,” said Rajan.
 
 According to him, providing a guarantee is like giving an equity. “Unless we account for these properly, there are huge contingent liabilities on the government balance sheet as well as on the bank’s, and it is important that we acknowledge them,” he said.
 
 On the 80:20 gold import scheme, Rajan said “objective criteria” was followed in liberalising the scheme in May 2014 when the government was in transition. “Our job was to see is this done in a reasonable way. I have not been able to go back to the circulars that were issued and the underlying discussions.”

 In May 2014, the 80:20 scheme was modified allowing premier trading houses and star trading houses to import gold. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) has observed that gold imported by 13 trading houses during June 2014 to November 2014 resulted in a windfall gain of about Rs 4,500 crore to them.
