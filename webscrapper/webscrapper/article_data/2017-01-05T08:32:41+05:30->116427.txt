AHMEDABAD: In early December, Axis Bank rendered the accounts of close to 100   in the city inactive, apparently acting on its own. 

 Though some of those accounts were made active within the next few days, after the concerned traders submitted their KYC documents and turnover details to the bank, several bullion traders and jewellers continue to face the struggle of running businesses while their bank accounts remain inactive.
 
 Sharing his experience,  , a bullion trader in Manek Chowk said, “The bank has given no intimation regarding this and rendered my account inactive without stating any reasons for the same. Despite submitting KYC documents, as well as turnover figures, no action has been taken by the bank.” Piyush Bhansali, president,  , said, “Several accounts are still inoperative and traders have not been given any reasons. Though traders are ready to cooperate with the government, bank accounts cannot be deactivated without prior notice.”
 
 “It has been 10 days, since I have submitted the necessary documents to the bank. However, my account continues to remain inoperative. Business is generally down after demonetization, and it is difficult to continue trading when cut off from working capital,” said  , another bullion trader in Manek Chowk.
 
 Some bullion traders have faced double trouble. There accounts were reactivated by the bank after due verification, only to be rendered inactive again, as soon as they began transactions, said some affected traders.  , a bullion trader, said, “I had submitted the documents back in December and my account was reopened. However, as soon as I began making transactions, the bank once again rendered my account inactive, and that too without intimation.” “Despite submitting all documents once again, and several follow-ups, there has been no action on the part of bank officials,” Patel said.
