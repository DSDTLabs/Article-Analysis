MUMBAI: Twenty-five years after the multi-crore securities scam involving ‘Big Bull’   broke, a special court convicted four former bank officers on Tuesday to three years’ imprisonment for criminal breach of trust and falsification of accounts that benefited the now deceased stock broker.

 “It was all done for Harshad Mehta,” said special   judge  , at the end of a trial that has lasted 21 years. 
 
 The four found guilty are: M S Srinivasan, 69, former funds manager of State Bank of Saurashtra;  , 65, ex-assistant manager of UCO Bank; R Sitaraman, 64, who was attached with SBI’s securities wing; and P A Karkhanis, 68, former senior manager,  .
 
 They were also fined Rs 5,000 each. The prosecution had charged them with causing losses worth crores to the banks.
 
 The accused were additionally found guilty under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The four immediately sought bail and got it on a surety bond of Rs 15,000 each.
 
 The case was abated against kingpin Mehta, who died on December 31, 2001, and another accused  , who also passed away during the pendency of the trial. 
 
 One of the accused, P S Gokhale, was acquitted for lack of evidence. A woman employee,  , serving with SBS had turned approver. She was acquitted by the court on Tuesday.
 
 The prosecution case was that in 1991, it was mandatory for every nationalized bank to keep a certain percentage of its ‘All India Deposits’ on a fortnightly basis with RBI and this was termed as Cash Reserve Ratio. 
 
 It stated that these banks were also required to invest the All India Deposits in securities called Statutory Liquidity Ratio.
 
 The prosecution said that to maintain these, the banks could borrow or lend from each other. However, the banks were not permitted to involve third parties, including stock brokers.
