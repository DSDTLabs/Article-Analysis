 and   starrer ‘Hindi Medium’ collected Rs 4.75 crore on Sunday, according to a report on Boxofficeindia.com. With this, the total weekend collection of the film stands at Rs 11.25 crore.

  Although the film hasn’t been able to make a strong impact at the box-office, it has been appreciated for its subject and an interesting storyline. ‘Hindi Medium’ is a satire on the Indian society, which considers the ability to speak English as the yardstick to measure sophistication. Through its lead couple portrayed brilliantly by Irrfan and Saba, the film explores the mindset of innumerable Indian parents, who aspire to enroll their children in English medium schools. It not only explores the Hindi-versus-English divide, but also conveys a message to eradicate the tendency to pitch one against the other.
