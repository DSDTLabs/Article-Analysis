KOLHAPUR: Shivaji University, Kolhapur (SUK) pro-VC D T   has said the Choice-Based Credit System ( ) structure is ready for undergraduate (UG) courses and might be implemented from the 2017-18 academic year.

 The committee formed for the implementation of the CBCS has reviewed the situation in the division and conducted the required meeting with college principals, he said.
 
 “The colleges are quite positive about the CBCS, which will allow flexibility in the students’ choices of subjects. This is a revolutionary step in our academics and we are ready to implement it by 2017-18. However, a formal nod has to come from the management and academic council members. If it does not come, the university might postpone the programme to the next academic year,” he said.
 
 “The exam department of the SUK is also positive about the changes in the current system. We have had meeting with the director of the board of examinations and evaluation, Mahesh Kakade, and they have shown an affirmative intent to implement the system,” Shirke said. 
 
 On the CBCS process, he said, a BA student, for example, can choose a subject from the BCom curriculum. “However, the subject from BCom can be told in the guideline to make sure the software is tweaked accordingly in universities across the state,” he said. 
 
 The   ( ) had asked universities and colleges to submit data on the uniform implementation of the CBCS earlier last month. In a circular on August 10 last year, the commission stated that it wanted to create a database on implementation of CBCS in universities across the country. 
 
 The UGC had in 2015 developed syllabi on 103 subjects, 85 of which are main line courses and 18 are specialised courses, giving 30 per cent choice to the universities to made amendments in the courses.
