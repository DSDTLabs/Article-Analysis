Ajay Trivedi had thrown the dog off the second floor as it used to defecate and urinate outside his apartment daily. Angry over the incident, Trivedi’s neighbours had called Samir Soni, an   who called the police. 

 Trivedi, who works as a salesman in a private firm, had apologized after the police arrived and his wife had requested Soni to not file complaint. 
 
 Soni didn’t file FIR and instead asked Trivedi to submit an apology letter to the police. “Trivedi had accepted in his apology letter that he threw the dog from second floor of his apartment in anger. Then why was he allowed to go scot-free without being punished? I learnt about the incident on Monday morning following which I approached the police and filed a complaint against Trivedi,” said animal activist, Neha Patel.
 
 “Letting off a person, who killed a dog, with just an apology letter would set a bad precedent. The police have promised to take action in the case,” Patel said. 
 
 Trivedi had also told the police that after throwing the puppy, he had paid money to a sweeper of the   to dispose of the carcass. He had promised that he will never ever do such a thing and will help the NGO in future for  .
