ERODE: Three women home guards have been dismissed from the service for lodging false sexual harassment complaints against a platoon commander.

 Erode superintendent of police (SP) R   had issued the dismissal order to the trio on Tuesday late evening.
 
 According to a source at the Erode SP office, the women home guards had last December submitted written complaints with the SP, saying their platoon commanderP Senthil Kumar had sexually harassed them while they were on duty.
 
 The SP subsequently ordered Gobichettipalayam   R   to probe the issue. “The DSP was also ordered to submit his findings to the SP at the earliest,” said an official, requesting anonymity.
 
 DSP R Selvam initiated a probe into the incident and questioned the three women home guards and also Senthil Kumar. In his report, Selvam said the complaints made by the three women home guards were false.
 
 After scrutinising the DSP’s report, the SP issued the dismissal order to the trio on Tuesday for making false complaints against the platoon commander. The copy of the order was served to the trio on Wednesday morning.
 
 Meanwhile, the trio said they would move the court for justice. Talking to TOI, one of the women officials said she has lost the confidence in the system after the dismissal order episode.
 
 “The DSP did not conduct the inquiry in a transparent manner. He submitted the report to the SP without completing the inquiry,” she said. She alleged that officials were trying to protect the platoon commander.
 
 The trio alleged that they had been receiving threats from police officials after lodging sexual harassment case against the platoon commander.
