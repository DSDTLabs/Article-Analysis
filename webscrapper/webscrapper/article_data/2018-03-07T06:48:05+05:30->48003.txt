GANDHINAGAR: Congress MLA  , while speaking during the debate on the budget, alleged that the BJP-led state government was involved in  , by clearing additional concessions in FSI to builders in four municipal corporations.

  
  Thakor said, “There is nothing in this budget for anganwadi workers, midday meal workers, ASHA workers, computer operators or gram panchayat workers. The goverment does not have money to pay to its employees or marginalised communities, but it gives crores of rupees to builders. There is nothing in this budget for the 30 lakh unemployed youth. In flood-affected areas of Banaskantha and Patan, middlemen made money while victims didn’t get what was meant for them. For the OBC welfare agency, there is hardly any allocation. It needs to be around Rs 1,000 crore.”
 
 “The youth are wasting their lives in liquor. Farmers are committing suicide but builders get all the benefits from this government. Just before the assembly elections, files of major builders were cleared in a short while and   leaders carried out massive corruption, worth crores,” he added.
