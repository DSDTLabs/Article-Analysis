NEW DELHI: The government told   on Wednesday that bar associations across the country, including the one in Supreme Court, had opposed the Advocates (Amendment) Bill, 2017, and the Law Commission’s 266th report which has recommended stringent disciplinary action against lawyers disrupting court work, including barring them from practising.

 The   has recommended amendments to the Advocates Act to allow lawyers a day's token strike in compelling circumstances with the prior approval of the bar council concerned. It also suggested appointment of eminent persons outside the legal profession as members in a proposed statutory body to deal with disciplinary proceedings against advocates.
 
 Minister of state for law P P Chaudhary said the law ministry had sought comments of the   and all state bar councils, besides bar associations of the SC and all high courts on the commission’s recommendations.
