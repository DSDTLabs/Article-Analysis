KWA is getting ready to re-launch its website kwa.kerala.gov.in with better features for payment of bills. It is also waiting for the consent of KWA board to launch multiple payment gateway options for online bill payment.

 “At present, KWA offers three e-payment options for its consumers.

The third option is online payment through KWA's website.The consumers can pay using debitcredit card or net banking. Currently, BillDesk is the payment gateway. KWA's board will decide on the proposal to include multiple payment gateways so that the consumers can choose the best option,“ said database administrator of KWA Jithendriyan S V P.
 
 The revamped KWA website will have options such as quick pay, which enable user to directly pay the bill without waiting to create an account.
 
 At present, the service charge for the pay ment gateway is Rs 10. For online payment using credit card, 2% of the bill amount will be taken as service charge. Once multiple payment gateway options are available, the consumers will get the service for lower service charges.
 
 Though KWA has around 19 lakh consumers in Kerala, only a lakh consumers are using the e-payment facilities.
 
 KWA is planning to organize various campaigns to attract more people to choose the e-payment option. Unlike, KSEB which has over 1 crore customers, KWA has difficulty in waiving the service charge due to its low bill amount and lesser number of consumers.
