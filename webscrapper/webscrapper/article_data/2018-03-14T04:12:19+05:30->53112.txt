Noida: A man was arrested on Tuesday in connection with the triple murder of BJP worker Shiv Kumar Yadav and his two gunners in Noida Extension. The accused Pradeep alias Bhola (25) is associated with   gang and hails from Khedi Bhanota village in Surajpur.

 Rajiv Narayan Mishra, additional SP Noida-STF, said police received information about the movement of Pradeep near Cherry County in Bisrakh. “He was planning to commit a crime in the area. An STF team recahed there and signalled him to stop but he tried to flee after firing at police team. The police chased him and arrested him from spot,” Mishra said. 
 
 Police found .315 bore revolver and a live cartridge from his possession. 
 
 During the interrogation, Pradeep told the police he was a part of the gang that had killed three persons. He had completed a BA programme and opened a transport agency in Noida. He was then introduced to Anil Bhati of Sunder Bhati gang by Pankaj, a local criminal. Bhati helped him in the business while Pradeep helped Bhati in the criminal activities.
 
 Shiv Kumar Yadav and his two personal gunners Balli Nath (38) and   (40) were shot dead when a group of gunmen attacked their Toyota Fortuner in Noida Extension on November 16, 2017. A 14-year-old girl Anjali, who was crossing the road, was mistakenly hit in this chase, and was also critically wounded. 
 
 She was rushed to ESIC Hospital in Noida where she too later succumbed to her injuries.
 
 On December 4, Noida STF arrested three criminals, Arun Yadav, his aide Dharmdutt Sharma and Naresh Jaat, a   of the Sunder Bhati gang, in connection with the murders. Arun had planned the murder to avenge the death of his father  , who was a head constable of the UP police.   died in an accident on March 8, 2004. However, Arun and his family suspected the accident was orchestrated by Shiv Kumar Yadav.
