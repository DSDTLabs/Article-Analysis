MUMBAI:   at the   limped to normalcy as the  ,000 plus resident doctors re-joined work after their five-day protest ended on Friday midnight. Security arrangements looked stringent, with several patients denied entry without a pass.

 Dr Rohit Kumar, first-year medicine resident, said he has resumed work and was happy to be back with patients. “There are visible security changes,“ he said. The assault on this doctor by relatives of a 60-yearold woman, who had died of kidney disease, close on the heels of the Dhule incident had triggered the statewide agitation.

Throughout the day , there were frequent brawls at these hospitals as patients and their relatives insisted on entering hospitals without passes. KEM treated over 4,500 people in the OPD.Sion also admitted nearly 200 patients. The casualty area of KEM was guarded by 20 security personnel, including Bhoiwada police. “Anybody found loitering without a pass was escorted out,“ said a patient.Shyam Sundaram, who has come from Bihar for his sister-inlaw's treatment, said relatives without a pass were asked to leave the ward.
 
 At Sion hospital, mob entry looked difficult. At least 4-5 guards were posted at each gate and kin asked to show ID cards and passes. But once inside, it was not hard to get in and out of wards. At Nair hospital, entry gates were heavily guarded.
