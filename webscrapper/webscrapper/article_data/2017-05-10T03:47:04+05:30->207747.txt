New Delhi: After the   of Manushi editor Madhu   to Jawaharlal Nehru University’s academic council (AC), many have been questioning her credentials in representing School of Arts and Aesthetics (SAA). Kishwar retorted by saying “this shows the intolerance” of those opposing her nomination.

 Kishwar, who has been nominated by vice chancellor M Jagadesh Kumar as an outside expert for two years, now has the power to attend AC meetings and decide on matters related to JNU’s academic policies.
 
 Though the dean of SAA Bishnupriya Dutt has no objections, she has asked why the process of asking for recommendations from the school was bypassed.
 
 Dutt told TOI that she came to know of Kishwar’s nomination on May 3 through a letter from the registrar’s office. “We then wrote a letter asking why the six names sent by us were neglected by the VC. We have nothing personal against Kishwar, but in the past 17 years the VC has never overlooked the list sent by the school. Why did they even ask for it if the VC was to use his discretionary powers?” she asked.
 
 “I was nominated in a legal manner. I am glad that they are opposing me. This goes against their usual diatribe that BJP is talent deficient. I’m not affiliated to any party. If they could make me a professor at CSDS during the   rule, then what is the big issue here?” Kishwar told TOI.
 
  rector-1, Chintamani Mahapatra, said that Kishwar’s nomination was done as per clause 15.3 X (xii) of JNU 1966 Act where it is written that the VC can co-opt or nominate someone from outside JNU who is not an employee but an expert. He added that requesting a list is a precedent, but nomination is under the VC’s ambit.
