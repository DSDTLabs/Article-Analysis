LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh's Sitapur district administration said on Saturday that closure of   in and around Khairabad, where the attacks are taking place, is one of the prime reasons behind the feral assaults. 

  Since May 1, six children have died after being mauled by dogs. The deaths have also led to a sharp drop in attendance in schools, with authorities saying that parents are scared of sending their wards to schools in the morning.
 
 "Closure of illegal slaughter houses in Khairabad municipal corporation area seems to be the main reason. The dogs were earlier feeding on remains disposed by illegal slaughter houses. Since the slaughterhouses have been closed, the strays are not getting meat and thus may have started attacking children," said district magistrate Sheetal Verma.
 
  City magistrate Harsh Deo Pandey said, "We have identified 11 villages where attacks have taken place. We are planning to give compensation to the victims' families." The authorities are, however, not sure whether the canines are strays which have turned   from nearby forest that are venturing into residential areas. 
 
  DIOS Sitapur, Devki Singh, said directions have been issued that students must be accompanied by their parents to school and must ensure that adults from the village pick and drop children. "Adults accompanying children have also been instructed to  ," said Singh. 
 
  IG (Lucknow range) Sujeet Pandey said that Sitapur police has been instructed to   during morning hours.
