JAIPUR/KOTA: The Centre has issued directions to states including   for developing a mechanism to provide permission or authorisation through municipal authority to the retail shops who are selling   products.

 The authorisation will be provided with a condition that the shops authorised for selling tobacco products, cannot sell any non-tobacco products such as toffees, candies, chips, biscuits, soft drinks which are essentially meant for children.
 
 The Centre has issued such letters to states of the country and Rajasthan too has received the letter.
 
 A health department official said that the policy of the   is to discourage tobacco consumption by discouraging demand and also by discouraging supply. For discouraging demand, pictorial warnings on packets of tobacco products have already been mandatory.
 
 But, now to discourage supply, it is recommended that the sellers should get authorisation from civic bodies to sell the tobacco products. Those who do not have any authorisation will not be able to sell tobacco products. Also, in the letter, the Centre has also recommended to the state government that those who have authorisation for selling tobacco products, will not be able to sale other products commonly purchased by children such as like toffee, biscuits and chocolates.
 
 Essentially, the ministry desires to licence the sale of tobacco through authorized vendors only,  , state patron of   (VoTV) and senior surgeon at SMS hospital, Jaipur. Dr   said adding in such a case, sale of candies/chocolates/biscuits would lead to cancellation of license.
