Mohit Suri’s ‘Aashiqui 2, which starred kids   and   in the lead, remains one of the best projects of the director as well the actors. Currently, Mohit is developing work on its third installment. However, according to recent reports, Mohit and Aditya had issues between them. As per a daily, a source disclosed that “all is well” between the two. 

 
 The daily quoted a source saying that there have been talks of Aditya being upset over Mohit turning it into a two-hero film. But truth is, it was always meant to be an ensemble film with an emphasis on Aditya's character. While he was happy with the script, they were going back and forth on the dates as Mohit wasn't finished with the casting process. 
 
 
 The source further added that when Aditya bagged ‘Kalank’, he told Mohit that he wanted to focus single-mindedly on it. So, it made sense for him to opt out of Mohit's film.
 
 
 But refusing to such speculations, Mohit reportedly said that he was in talks with Aditya. But he is yet to cast two male actors and one female actor for the principal cast. That will take a while. And that there's no point keeping Aditya away from other films. He might as well let Aditya do ‘Kalank’. He clearly mentioned that there's no fallout.
 
 
  While Mohit plans to get the movie on floors by the year-end, he said that if the dates work out, who knows, Aditya might even do this one together.
