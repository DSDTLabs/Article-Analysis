While most students in   were on vacation after   and making exciting plans before the new semester began, there were some who didn’t take even a single day off during the winter break in college. These members of the students’ union were busy planning for their respective college’s   that will take place in the period from January to March – which is why the holidays were the only time they had to plan and get sponsorships.

 
 
 Nayan Jhangiani, the media head of  , tells us that after the exams, she and the members of her team did not take a single day off. "The college was technically closed, but we were going regularly to prepare for our fests. This is the only time for us to get sponsorships. Our fest will be organized in the second week of January. Rest toh ab fest ke baad hi hoga. Abhi toh soch bhi nahi sakte iss baare mein," she says.
  Payal Chauhan, the president of JDMC, who is also an outstation student, adds, "We have a team of around 18 people for the preparations. We had also cancelled visits to our respective hometowns."
 
 
  
 
 Dilmeet Kaur, the Public Relations Officer from  , says that she has a team of 15 students who worked through the holidays to get sponsorships. "I was working to get sponsorships even during my exams. I get calls for stalls and bookings, and I am also in charge of assigning work to my team members. So this month was definitely not the time to chill and relax. My college friends had been putting photos from their holidays and although I got jealous, I knew that this was the only time for us to build the base for the fest," she explains.
