THANE: A seven-year-old boy from   had to undergo a surgical procedure after he swallowed a spring from his toy gun on Sunday. The Class II student, Harsh  , was playing with the gun and opened it with a screwdriver when he laid his hands on the 1.5-cm spring while his mother was cooking.

 “While fidgeting with the screwdriver, he had held the spring in his mouth,” said his mother  . “He came to me and muttered that he had swallowed the spring.”
 
 The boy was rushed to   in Thane where Dr  , pulmonologist, took an X-ray and realised that the spring was lodged in the chest. The boy was finding it hard to breathe. “He did not have to go under the knife. A small tube with a camera on the end was introduced in the chest with instruments attached at one end. The foreign body was removed within 15 minutes,” said Dr Vaidya.
