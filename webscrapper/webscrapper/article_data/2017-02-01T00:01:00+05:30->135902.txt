MUMBAI: The   on Monday imposed a cost of Rs 50,000 on an activist who sought more information on the   project, pertaining to Aarey.

 A bench of Chief Justice   and Justice   dismissed a petition by Khar resident Zoru Bathena noting he has already filed a PIL about tree-cutting in the city and “under the guise of non-furnishing of information under the Right to Information Act is again seeking direction not to cut the trees”. The bench said Bathena “intends to make this petition as a platform for securing the information”.
 
 According to Bathena’s petition, the urban development department issued a notice on December 29, 2016, calling for objections and suggestions. Through RTI, he learnt the authorities propose to cut over 5,000 trees and delete a non-development zone of 3.30 lakh sq m for the car shed at Aarey. He urged direction to the authorities to furnish him more information. His advocate   urged the bench to “at least stay implementation of the notice” so he can submit his objections.
 
 The bench said Bathena could have made the plea in the PIL and questioned why he had not approached the appellate authorities under RTI. Bathena has to pay the amount to the Maharashtra State Legal Services Authority.
