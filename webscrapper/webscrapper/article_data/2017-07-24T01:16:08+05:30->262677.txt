GURUGRAM: Chairman and managing director of power discom   (DHBVN) Shatrujit Kapoor announced on Sunday that areas where line losses to discom are less than 20% will receive   of power  . Kapoor made the announcement when he met village heads from Gurgaon and   blocks, as part of ‘Mhara Gaon-Jagmag Gaon’ scheme on Sunday.

 Rural areas of Gurgaon and Ambala will receive round-the-clock power supply from August 15. Rural feeders and infrastructure will be improved in villages of the two districts for this purpose.
 
 “Gurgaon is known for its development and we expect better results from the panchayats here then any other district. We request the sarpanches to cooperate with the officials. They may feel a little reluctant initially, but will realise its benefits once they will see the ‘Jagmag’ results,” said Kapoor.
 
 Kapoor also asked people to use more LED bulbs, stating that the state has asked the central government to increase the supply of LED bulbs in order to boost ‘Mhara Gaon-Jagmag Gaon’ scheme. 
 
 Kapoor requested locals to help discom officials nab people involved in power thefts. DHBVN has nabbed 1,500 power thieves in past three months and recovered Rs 11 crores as penalty. 
 
 “We need to stop wasting electricity because it is an important resource. When Gurgaon is progressive, we need to utilise our resources progressively too,” said Balwan Singh Rana, superintendent of police, power and vigilance.
