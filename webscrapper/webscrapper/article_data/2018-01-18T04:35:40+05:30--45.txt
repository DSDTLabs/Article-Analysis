MUMBAI: Standing committee members on Wednesday demanded a police case against the   and civic official concerned, instead of the crane operator, in the incident where four labourers died after they fell 9m down a   in  . 

 The incident took place on January 1, when the crane pulley that was used to winch the labourers from the manhole snapped. The committee members said under the labour law, the principal employer—in this case the BMC commissioner—is also responsible for the negligence.
 
 “The   entered into agreement with the contractor. He is the principal employer. So, the   should be also filed against him or the officer who was handling the work with the contractor. Officials can’t escape their responsibility after filing a case against the crane operator,” said standing committee member and BJP group leader Manoj Kotak. Congress corporator Ravi Raja said, “The BMC has issued show-cause and stop-work notices to the contractor. Despite this, they wanted to give two new contracts to the same contractor.” Additional municipal commissioner A L Jarhad said he will discuss the issue with legal team and update the committee. — Vijay V Singh
