 Krishnagiri: Police have detained a woman after her 18-month-old child was found strangulated near Uthanapalli in Krishnagiri district on the late hours of Thursday.
 
 The toddler has been identified as K Madhusri, daughter of Kembaiyaa, 35, of Anumandapuram near Uthanapalli. “He was married to Radha of Thoddabelur near Kelamangalam six years ago. The couple has one other child, four-year-old Mahendran. Radha was in a relationship with a youth in Hosur. Kembaiyaa, who came to know about the affair, had warned Radha,” Uthanapalli police said.
 
 On Thursday night, Radha informed her neighbours that the baby was found dead. The neighbours, who grew suspicious about her claims, alerted Uthanapalli police. They detained the mother and sent the toddler’s body to the Hosur Government Hospital for post-mortem.
 
 A case was registered and further investigations are underway. “We will initiate action against Radha if she is found guilty,” a police officer said.
