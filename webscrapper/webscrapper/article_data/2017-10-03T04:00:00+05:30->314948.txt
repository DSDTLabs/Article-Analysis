Mount Abu:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  

 In a congregation of virtually all the academic institutions of Mount Abu, at the forest guest house, the collector of Sirohi, Sandesh Nayak, together with the SP, Sirohi, Om Prakash, Sangram Singh Katiyar, DFO Sirohi, the SDM, Mount Abu, Suresh Kumar Ola, and, the DFO, Mount Abu, Hemant Singh, and many more who’s who of Mount Abu, were party to the flag off of the ambitious rally, announcing the start of the World Wild Life Week 2017. 
 
 Just before the take off, the town was briefed about the elaborate itinerary for the week-long programme. A Sloth Bear plaque was inaugurated by the collector along the Sun Set road, in the forest area. A resolute attention has been directed to all the students of Mount Abu, as they would be the torch bearers of environment, for the future. It took off with a huge rally, flagged off by none other than the proactive collector Sandesh Nayak. The meaningful rally started from the forest guest house, going round the busiest bazaar, with warning on the lips of every student. “Beware, we would no more let you strip the forest any further”. 
 
 Rather an ambitious awareness program called ‘Green Munia Zone’, would be presented on October 3 in various schools. The well structured presentation, brings alive the close association of birds with human surroundings, including the forests. 
 
 Indeed, the week would be enriched and embellished with quiz competition, poster competition, and even screening of pertinent Eco-movies, at the state of the art MP Hall of NAB – PNM, Rehabilitation Centre for the Blind Mount Abu.
