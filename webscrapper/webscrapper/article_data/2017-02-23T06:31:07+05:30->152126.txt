HYDERABAD: An unfazed and defiant   ( ) chairman Prof M   on Wednesday evening called TJAC’s   highlighting unemployment in the state a success. And leaving no one in doubt about what the future holds, he said the   has no intention of giving up on its campaign on the issue of the TRS-led government failing to keep the political party’s promise of filling all vacancies in the government and provide employment to the youth of the state. 

 In a significant statement, he said the JAC will consider receiving support from political parties when it is required and this issue will be discussed with parties that come forward to support the JAC.
 
 The JAC, he said, will meet on Thursday morning to discuss Wednesday’s events and its future plan of action. He also demanded the immediate release of other TJAC leaders and others who were arrested by the police since Monday evening. He then called on TJAC members to send details of such arrests from across the state to the JAC on Whatsapp.
 
 Speaking to reporters after his release by the police, the TJAC chairman decried the way he was arrested by the police. “The police broke open the doors and barged into my house even after my requesting the deputy commissioner of police (East Zone) Ravinder to give me some time,” Kodandaram said.
 
 He said unemployment is a serious issue but the state government repeatedly chose to ignore the JAC’s demands that action be taken on this front. “Though the JAC applied for permission to rally and meeting 20 days ago, the police did not react till the very end and then suggested that our meeting be held at Nagole metro land. Our request to allow us to hold a public meeting at the Nizam College grounds was also denied,” he said.
 
 He also announced moral support for the call for a bandh of all educational institutions on Thursday called for by some students organisations.
