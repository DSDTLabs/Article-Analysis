NEW DELHI: Stay calm, sleep well and eat nutritious food — this is what the advice counsellors and doctors have for students working under immense pressure, preparing for the  . With less than a month in hand, counsellors worry that students will neglect their health and harm their systems in an effort to score better.

 According to   Dr  , students need to take care of their diet and sleep better while preparing for the board exams. “Students should not be fed heavy meals rich in carbohydrates or fat. It will make them lazy. Smaller but frequent meals are better because they need to stay alert,” said Nagpal.
 
 Astha Sharma, a counsellor, also suggested that students should get involved in recreational activities like sports, music, etc. “Long hours of study with no breaks are not good. It leads to saturation,” she said.
 
  
  
 Ample amount of liquids should to be a part of the diet, Nagpal said. “I know children don’t consume any liquids or water all day long. It’s not a good idea. They must keep themselves hydrated with water, juice or coconut water. It will help them focus,” he said.
 
 Nagpal and Sharma also told students to stick to the schedule during preparation time. “I tell my students that they should plan their studies and set up their schedule. This helps them to remove anxiety,” said Sharma.
 
 Nagpal added that parents must ensure that the atmosphere in the house remains the same as before, with enough laughter to keep the mood light. “They must understand that this is just a step in life. It’s not a make or break situation.”
 
 In fact, he said the children should not be confined to just studying and this needs to be seen as a time to bond with the family. “Going to functions and events once in a while is a good option,” said Nagpal. “Parents and children must look at this time to do things together and bond. Parents must also engage with their children and keep talking to them to create a comfortable atmosphere,” he suggested.
