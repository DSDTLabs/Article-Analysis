CHANDIGARH:   vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar   has recommended that registrar   (retd) be re-appointed up to the age of 60 years. Chadha’s term will expire in October this year, three months after VC’s retirement. The recommendation will be taken up at the syndicate meeting on June 10.

 Chadha assumed the charge on October 1, 2014. According to regulation, “a person appointed substantively may, after expiry of the original term of four years , be re-appointed by the senate as registrar and his service shall be deemed continuous from the date of his first appointment.”
 
 The university corridors are abuzz with the talks that the new vice-chancellor who comes after Grover’s retirement would want to make his own team and registrar’s post is the most important administrative post.
 
 According to the university Act, “The registrar shall be a whole-time paid officer of PU appointed by the senate. He shall be in charge of the administration acting under the immediate control of the vice-chancellor and shall represent PU in all legal proceedings except where the senate otherwise resolves.”
 
 Moreover, the university syndicate will also take up the matters deferred in the last syndicate meeting. The amendments in the service rules in implementation of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, that the provision of two-third majority should be replaced with simple majority of the persons present and voting to decide on the major penalty if found guilty of sexual harassment will also be taken up by the syndicate.
 
 A committee had suggested that PU should recommend to the ministry of human resource development to modify the regulation of PU calendar so that simple majority can terminate a PU teacher on the ground of serious misconduct, involving moral turpitude, inefficiency or incapacity. These recommendations will be taken up by the Panjab University syndicate on June 10.
