Hilmi Mustaffa, a strategy planner at a leading advertising agency in Malaysia, said it all when he commented, “Had it been a Shah Rukh Khan film, the audience in Malaysia would be all riled up against any such ban.”

 M Danish, a filmmaker of Pakistani origin, who is currently making a documentary on  , goes a step further. “In all likelihood, an SRK essaying this role of Sultan Alauddin Khilji would not have bothered the Censor Board in Malaysia.”
 
 
 
 Both Hilmi and Danish are not big   fans. But with the latest confirmation from the   to the local distributors  , that the ban stands, many are disappointed. Antenna had made a plea to the government to review the ban again.
 
 Antenna Entertainments managing director Liza Anand was quoted saying in local newspapers, that the censor board has stated that the filmhas elements that touch on Muslim sensitivities – in particular, the villainous portrayal of Sultan Alauddin Khilji.
 
 Khadijah Khan, who is an eager Bollywood fan, said, “why ban a movie based on something that happened centuries ago? The audience has evolved and movies don’t hurt sentiments.” According to Danish, it is “silly” to ban a film, when it is easily accessible on other platforms , thanks to technology. “This ban is just a way to announce the political stance of the government of the day.”
 
 Malaysia has a huge fan base for Bollywood. Many have expressed their dismay on Facebook. Aruun Kumarr Athikumanan wrote: “Do they even understand the content of the film? We will watch it in Singapore.” Alpa Raj, entrepreneur and restaurant-owner, said she was extremely disappointed. “This was one film which showcases the pride and valour of Indian kings and queens against the invaders and that too on a canvas so huge. We are deprived of it now.”
