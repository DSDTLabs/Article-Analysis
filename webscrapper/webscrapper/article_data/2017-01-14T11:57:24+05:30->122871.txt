ALLAHABAD: When it comes to competing with police in use of hi-tech gadgets, the babas are not far behind. This  , saints at the camp of   alias Vinaiaka Baba have equipped themselves with the state-of-the-art technology for enhancing security at the camps. 

 From a network of hi-tech CCTVs to walky-talky, the seers of the camp are keeping an eye on the movement of devotees on the mela premises. The technology is also coming in handy for these   saints for keeping in touch with each other, especially when the mobile network, irrespective of the operators, fails in the area. 
 
 “We have installed 12   cameras in our camp and have given 10 walky-talky to the saints and volunteers of the camp so that there is an integrated network of communication among all the vital service providers of the camp,” said Vinaiaka Baba. 
 
 The CCTV facility will also help curb incidents of theft on the mela premises. 
 
 “With the help of the facility, we keep a close vigil on the campus, and in case we spot anything unusual, we use the walky-talky to spread the word,” said  . 
 
 The camp of Vinaiaka Baba has a control room on the camp premises, which is monitored 24X7. The facility is so designed that the CCTV footage can be viewed on the main seer’s laptop. 
 
 The saints of the camp and other volunteers, looking after various services of the camp, are trained to handle these gadgets, which includes installation of CCTVs and their repair work, if needed, added Vinaiaka Baba.
