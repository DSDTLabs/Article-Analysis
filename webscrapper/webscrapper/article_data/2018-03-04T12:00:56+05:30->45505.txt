 Other management members also alleged that the students and parents were furious because the college did not allow students to cheat. “We never allowed MIT to be a centre. But this year, the board insisted on having us because there would be cases of mass cheating in the previous centre. The parents are clearly enraged that we don’t allow any cheating. Hence, this malicious attempt to devalue our brand name,” said the senior member.
 
 Approximately 260 students are taking the exam at the centre. Of them, about 80 are girls.
 
 The chief conductor of examination in the centre, college principal Virendra Bawaskar, showed TOI a sack filled with chits confiscated from students. “We did not report it to the board because we did not want the students to suffer. Maybe, that was our mistake,” said another member.
