NEW DELHI: In a rare case of imprisonment for  , a Delhi court has sentenced two persons for three years in jail and a fine of more than Rs 3 lakh each despite the fact that they were first-time offenders.

 
 The income   department, which has filed more than 4,500 prosecution cases in courts across the country against tax evaders in the last one year, argued for a maximum punishment of seven years prescribed under I-T Act on the ground that “economic offences are more heinous than other offences because they affect the entire nation”.
 
 The court refused to accept the accused’s plea that they were first-time offenders and had otherwise clean antecedents and did not have any criminal tendency. One of the accused also sought leniency on health grounds since he was a heart patient and had a stent implant.
 
 A top I-T functionary said the department had been successful in getting more people convicted for tax evasion as the courts had started treating economic offences as heinous crimes.
 
 In this case, the company promoted by the accused, Style Syntex Pvt Ltd, was fined over Rs 7 lakh for showing lower profit in the balance sheet for the 2001-02 financial year. The two accused were separately fined over Rs 3 lakh each and given three years’ jail. The two accused filed their returns by “concealing true income and attempted to evade tax” by showing lower gross profit as reflected in their firm’s balance sheet.
