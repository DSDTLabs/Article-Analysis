Visakhapatnam: Alarmed by the rising number of   accidents, city youths are gearing up for a mega traffic safety awareness drive.

 More than 200 people, including students, employees, commuters and traffic police, are expected to take part in the event which will be held from May 5 to May 31. The campaign is being organised by Yes We Can (YWC) organisation to mark United Nations Global road safety week. This year’s theme is ‘save lives, slow down’.
 
 The purpose of organising such an event is to sensitise the public about the ills of negligent driving, drunk driving and use of phones when driving.
 
 According to Dr K Fakeerappa, deputy commissioner of police, Visakhapatnam city, “The city is growing and so traffic congestion is increasing. People need to be sensitised on every aspect of traffic.”
 
 Fakeerappa said the number of road accidents in India in 2015 and 2016 were 4,89,400 and 5,10,423 respectively with a growth of 2.5 per cent. The number of persons who died due to accidents in 2015 and 2016 were 1,39,671 and 1,46,133 respectively with a growth of 4.6 per cent.
 
 According to founder and president of Yes We Can Stephen Anurag, “This initiative is being organised to celebrate the third foundation day of Yes We Can. This year, the focus will be on traffic education.”
 
 The campaign will be organised in association with the biking community Naked Wolves and Road Thrill. A video of the event will be uploaded on the United Nations official website.
