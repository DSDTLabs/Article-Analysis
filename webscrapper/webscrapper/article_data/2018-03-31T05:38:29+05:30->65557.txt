AHMEDABAD: The   (STB) under the state home department has suggested   in four major   cities.   cited examples of Delhi where new autorickshaws are allowed only if the old ones are de-registered and phased out. The 19-page STB report has cited the example of Surat where autorickshaw entry is banned between 5pm to 7pm and then again between 10 pm and 12 am - thus helping reduce congestion on some of the important arterial roads like Rajmarg, says Surat police commissioner Satish Sharma. 

 STB officials said while there are 22,000 autos in Vadodara, about 15,000 to 17,000 in Rajkot and close to about 1 lakh in Ahmedabad, there is needs for some check on registration to reduce traffic congestion during peak hours.
