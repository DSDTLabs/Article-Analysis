PATNA:   vice-chancellor (VC)   has submitted a proposal to the government to set up three separate universities for the   in Bihar with a view to streamlining higher education in the state. 

 “MU, which is spread over seven districts, including Gaya, Nawada, Nalanda, Patna, Arwal, Aurangabad and Jehanabad, needs to be bifurcated soon so that proper academic growth in the field of higher education is maintained. There are more than 160 affiliated colleges under MU’s jurisdiction and almost 4 lakh students are enrolled at the postgraduate and undergraduate levels. During my three-year tenure as VC, I was mostly confronted with problems related to students’ grievances of the affiliated colleges which are governed by their own Acts, statutes, regulations and ordinances,” Ishtiaque said on Tuesday, adding none of the affiliated colleges had proper infrastructure.
 
 He further said the state government would not need to spend much for setting up three different universities for its affiliated colleges. According to him, “The government simply has to appoint new VCs and registrars and the rest of the employees can be selected from the affiliated colleges on the basis of their eligibility. These colleges can also function independently to promote quality teaching and have their own academic calendar. A lot depends on the government’s reaction to the proposal.”
 
 The number of constituent colleges under MU’s jurisdiction is only 44 and they are controlled by the   and the State Universities Act. “Since the university strictly holds examinations at the constituent colleges, mediocre students of the affiliated colleges are scoring over bright students of the constituent colleges due to the alleged practice of unfair means there,” Ishtiaque said and added separate universities should be centrally located at Nalanda, Samastipur and Siwan based on the linguistic priorities of students.
