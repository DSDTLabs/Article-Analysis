MADURAI: Madurai is facing one of its worst droughts in the last five decades. Unlike the previous years, bore wells have started running dry as early as January itself instead of peak summer. The corporation has put contingency plans in place, with plans to supply urban residents with 65 to 70mld of water, after the 80mld from   is used. 
 
 Vaigai dam is the primary source of water for Madurai city, from where the corporation draws 1500 million cubic feet. Though the normal supply to a population of 10 lakhs is 115 MLD per day, it fell to 80mld in the last few months due to scanty rainfall. Fifty eight per cent of the city's population gets its water from water service connections and the rest depend on public water.
 
 On Tuesday, private tanker owners were called for a meeting with corporation special officer,  , to discuss solutions to tide over the crisis. The corporation wanted to know whether the private tanker operators could help the civic body supply water to residents for the next three months. They were told that their vehicles would be examined periodically by the corporation authorities to check chlorine levels and ensure hygiene. They were also warned against over-charging people due to the acute scarcity. "We charge Rs850 for 1000 litres of water. If the water crisis gets worse, we would have to increase the price by at least Rs100," said one tanker operator.
 
 The corporation commissioner said that this was in addition to the contingency plans, which includes the laying of   in the city. Some of these tankers plied in specified routes, where the affluent sections of the population could afford to pay for tanker loads of water. In a crisis, the focus is on supplying to the poorer sections of society, as they cannot afford to by tanker water.
 
 The   dam's water level stood at 25.75ft on Tuesday, with an inflow of 40 cusecs, coming from the Periyar dam. If the water level reaches 20ft, outflow would be immediately stopped. Meanwhile, the water level in the Mullai Periyar dam stood at 110.70ft with an inflow of 16 cusecs, against last year's water level of 133.80ft. On January10, 2016, the water level in the Vaigai dam stood at 55.77ft, with an inflow of 1381 cusecs.   Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri, that the present availability in the dam, would help them meet the drinking water requirements of the city till the end of February, under the four-day supply scheme which has been in place since last August.
