Ghaziabad: A 42-year-old   dealer was   of his wallet containing Rs 17,000 and credit cards, besides his mobile phone near New Ghaziabad railway station on Saturday.

 The property dealer, Deepak Kumar Sharma, said that after completing his work for the day, he slept in his office in Raj Nagar District Complex. He woke up around 12.30am and walked to a road near New Ghaziabad railway station to hire an autorickshaw to go to his home in Sector 23, Sanjay Nagar. Soon, two youths aged between 20 and 22 years approached him and asked him to lend Rs 20 to buy tobacco.
 
 “I gave them the money, but could not understand their intentions. They wanted to see how much cash I was carrying. They went away, but after a few minutes, they came back and attacked me with full force,” said Sharma.
 
 Sharma alleged that the two men tried to strangulate him and then hit his head on the ground, after which he lost consciousness. Thinking that he died, the robbers fled with his wallet and mobile phone.
 
 “They hit me, made me unconscious and escaped with cash and mobile phone,” Sharma added.
 
 “However, my trauma did not end here. After I regained consciousness, I called up police after borrowing a mobile phone from a cab driver. However, the police van came only after 30 minutes. Later, at Kavi Nagar police station, the cops reprimanded me for wandering alone in the night. Before leaving for home, I managed to file a complaint,” said Sharma.
 
 SHO, Kavi Nagar police station, Samarjeet Singh, refuted the allegations against police and said they would take action on his complaint.
