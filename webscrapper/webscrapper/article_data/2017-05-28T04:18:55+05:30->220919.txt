GURUGRAM: The DHBVN hopes 19 new transformers will help it solve the power cut problem in  . And it had better happen fast as outages that started with the onset of summer show no signs of abating. 

 According to residents in Sector 56, Sector 41, Sector 21, South City 2, South City 2 and DLF-4, dust storms on Friday evening disrupted  . “In Gurgaon, power cuts have become a daily routine.

 Residents of South City 2 also had the same complaint. “On Friday, after the storm, power went off at 6pm and the supply was resumed at 9.30pm for 20 minutes. It was only after 11.30pm that the supply was fully restored. I kept calling the officials. They promised to fix the issue yet nothing happened,” said Dinesh Yadav, a resident of A-Block.
 
 In Sector 56, power cuts led to water shortage too. “We did not have enough water today (Saturday) for household chores due to frequent outages,” said Satish Kaushik, a resident of Sushant Lok 2. He added, “On Thursday, power went off at 9.45pm and was restored at 12.30am. On Friday, the supply was disrupted eight times. On Saturday too, till noon, power went off thrice.”
 
 Power officials said there were no scheduled outages. “On Saturday, we had no power cuts,” said Kuldeep Nehra, subdivision officer, DLF city. “On Friday, the outages happened from the power house only. After a storm, we have to cut supply to save the infrastructure.” Subdivision officer South City Dharam Singh said that he did not receive any reports of power cuts from his area. “There was no report of any outage,” he said.
