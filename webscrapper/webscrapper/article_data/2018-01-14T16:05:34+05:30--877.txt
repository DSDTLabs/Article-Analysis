South super star   who is in a relationship with Tamil director   is apparently putting forth a few conditions for accepting new films. With speculation rife that the Malayalam beauty may tie the knot anytime soon with   Sivan, her conditions make sense even if they might not be welcomed by filmmakers. For starters, she has been doing only heroine-centric films and roles opposite senior heroes of late. Now, some of the additional conditions she has before accepting a film are not to be forced to appear for the promotions of the film and no intimate scenes to be screened on her. 

 If one were to go by her recent release Jai Simha, one would clearly observe that there is not even a single scene in which the hero   touches her. Despite these conditions, producers are queuing up for her dates, which is a pointer to the stardom of the actress.
