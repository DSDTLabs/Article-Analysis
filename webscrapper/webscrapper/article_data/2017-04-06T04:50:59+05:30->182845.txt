NEW DELHI: Are reports of parliamentary standing committees meant only for in-house purposes and the judiciary is barred from relying on their findings to adjudicate a public interest matter? The   agreed on Wednesday to examine the issue and referred it to a constitution bench. 

 Although a bench of Justices   and R F Nariman was of the opinion that parliamentary committee reports could not be relied upon or examined by courts, it referred the case to a larger bench for an authoritative pronouncement on the controversial issue.
 
  The court said there was a constitutional demarcation of power among different organs of the state and the court should follow the doctrine of restraint. "We are prima facie of the view that the parliamentary committee reports may not be relied upon to bolster a fact that a particular act is not good. We think it appropriate to refer the issue to constitution bench," the bench said. 
 
 The court passed the order while hearing a PIL seeking its direction to the Centre to take steps on the basis of findings of two parliamentary committee reports which had pointed out various deficiencies in conducting clinical trials of a vaccine against cervical cancer in Andhra Pradesh, Telengana and  .
 
  The petition, filed by social activist  , alleged that the vaccine was administrated among 24,000 girls in tribal areas and several of them died during the trial. She pointed out that the parliamentary reports had also flayed regulatory authorities for allowing human trials of the vaccine in violation of the rules and urged the court to seek action taken reports from the Centre. 
 
  Senior advocate   and Anand Grover, appearing for the petitioner, told the bench that there was nothing wrong in relying upon the reports for reference to pass orders. They said the stand taken by the Centre before the Committee is binding and the government could not change its position before the apex court.
