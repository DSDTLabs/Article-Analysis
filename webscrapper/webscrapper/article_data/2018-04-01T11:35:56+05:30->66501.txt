TRICHY: Menstruation and psycho-social support (MAPS) program, an initiative of the district administration to help women handle menstruation better with the help of men, is to be held for the first time at Thiruvarankulam block in   district.

 The aim of the pilot project is to bridge the gap between men and women on understanding biological changes. The idea came into effect after a social media post of Pudukkottai sub-collector Sarayu KM went viral. Her post was an outburst of emotions after she had to investigate 12 suicide cases of women in a span of three months. She found that most of the victims to be menstruating when they took the extreme step.
 
 “In a lot of these cases, the women in question are ones who were nursing infants. Post-partum depression is something none of us have even tried to understand and this is how the idea of MAPS evolved,” said Sarayu. In addition to the enormous amount of anger and despair that they feel, the mental pressure from family members who fail to concur with their emotions, put women in their worst mental state, pushing them to take the extreme step, she said. 
 
 The members of MAPS which include officials from various departments, NGOs and members of civil society met on Friday to discuss the strategies. The project is gaining shape with a 3-tier approach and a training module for the same is being prepared. District-level key resource persons would be identified and trained, who in turn will train women self-help groups and they will reach out to women in distress.
 
 “This project will help educate women on menstrual hygiene and psycho-social aspect of periods,” said senior scientist   from M S   (MSSRF) adding that in most cases young women, especially in the rural parts, fail to understand the biological changes that happen to them. “Another main aspect of the program is to make men aware of the psycho-social condition of women,” said deputy director of health services Pudukkottai B Baranidharan.
