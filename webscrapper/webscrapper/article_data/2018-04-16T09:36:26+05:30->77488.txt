LUCKNOW: The uncle of the survivor alleged that MLA Sengar’s brother Atul, who is lodged in   jail, is getting threats issued to villagers and telling them not to speak to police against him or his brother.

 He also alleged that his cousin son   (name changed) is also reported missing. “On Saturday night, about a dozen youths reached the village in two SUVs and threatened the villagers to keep mum if police quizzes them or leave the village,” he alleged.
 
 He alleged that   had forced Monu to lodge a case against the survivor’s father. “Monu’s father, however, had told the special investigation team (SIT) that he had no grudge with the survivor’s father,” he claimed.
