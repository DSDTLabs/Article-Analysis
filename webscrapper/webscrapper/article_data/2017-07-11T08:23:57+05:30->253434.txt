 The men are daring enough to spend even a week in inaccessible areas to track the movements of tigers and leopards, the officer said. The gang also has links with wildlife traders both nationally and internationally, the officer added.

The existing expertise with the forest officials was not sufficient to track the gang's movement, adding that various enforcing agencies will have to work in coordination to track its movements, he added
 
 Another officer said the gang could have reached Mudumalai through Sathyamangalam. They could go to Chamarajanagar in Karnataka, as wildlife trophies from the gang usually go through this route, the officer said.
