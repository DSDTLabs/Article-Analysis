GUWAHATI: With the Union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, giving its approval for the agreement between India and   to develop fairways on the   stretch of the Kushiyara river and the   stretch of the Jamuna rivers, officials here said these steps will expedite the process of using the Brahmaputra and Barak rivers as viable inland water routes. 

 The cabinet on Wednesday approved a MoU between India and Bangladesh for the fairway development along the India-Bangladesh protocol route by undertaking joint dredging. 
 
 A fairway is a navigable channel in a river or harbour. The Barak river in Assam branches out as Kushiyara and Surma in Bangladesh, while the Jamuna branches out of the Brahmaputra. Officials here said the northeast is all set to benefit from the reduction in the cost of logistics for cargo movement in the region. They said that with the Centre and the state government already working on developing the Brahmaputra (national waterway 2) and Barak (national waterway 16) for navigation, developing the two rivers in Bangladesh will be a boon for inland water transport in the region.
 
 The bilateral protocol on inland water transit between India and Bangladesh allows movement of vessels between the river ports of Haldia and Kolkata (West Bengal), Pandu, Karimganj and Silghat (Assam) and Bangladesh's Narayanganj, Khulna, Mongla, Sirajganj and Ashuganj. 
 
 Officials said the inland water route emerges as the most viable alternative to road transport through the congested Siliguri "Chicken neck corridor". 
 
 Union minister for road transport, highways and shipping   on the concluding day of   festival here on Tuesday said that the river route will bring down the road transport cost to at least Rs 4,000 per truck carrying commodities to the northeast.
 
 At the same event, a tripartite agreement between the Assam government, the   and   was signed for dredging the Brahmaputra to make the river navigable.
