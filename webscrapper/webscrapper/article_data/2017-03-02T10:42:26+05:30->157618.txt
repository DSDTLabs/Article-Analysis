NASHIK: The young scientists of 10 civic schools were hard at work on the last day of the two-day exhibition by the   (MVP) explaining concepts and theories.

 The project aimed at answering questions such as how does a spinning wheel balance itself, what is the centre of gravity and how does one hear sound through an earphone.
 
 The ‘Shaniwari – Vidnyanwari’ (Saturday Science) project organised by the MVP of Nashik and Mumbai gave the students of 10 Nashik   (NMC) schools a taste of science.
 
 “I know how to ride a bicycle, but I always wondered how it balances itself even when my father does not hold it. Today, when I saw the experiment of gyroscope under the tree I understood it,” said  , a student who had come to see the exhibition held at NMC schools 11 and 105.
 
 Similarly, the students were explained other concepts like that of the centre of gravity in a simple and easy manner.
 
 The programme was especially organized for students and teachers of the civic schools with the help of college students, who donned the roles of volunteers for the project.
 
 “It was an exciting way to learn science with the help of Vidnyan Parishad which helped us to make things from the items lying around us instead of buying or getting any new material, especially for this project. This way we used the waste to create the best for the exhibition,” said Pranjali Patil, another student.
 
 The progamme was organised with the help of the NMC in which the Parishad targeted at least 250 students from the 10 civic schools. “The aim was to spread science literacy among all the students of schools and colleges, inspire them to develop a scientific approach towards life and society and to have the youths as volunteers to spread the message of science to the masses with the help of daily experiments and logic,” said  , office-bearer of Nashik MVP.
