CHENNAI: More than nine months after the demise of chief minister  , the chorus seeking a probe into her death is getting louder, directly proportionate to the attack by T T V Dhinakaran on the Edappadi K Palaniswamyled government.

 On Sunday, Rajya Sabha member   said in a veiled warning to Dhinakaran that action would be initiated against those behind the death of Jayalalithaa after the inquiry in this regard is completed. Not just Vaithilingam, the conspiracy angle in the death was given fresh lease of life by a number of   leaders in the Edappadi dispensation raising the decibel levels by several notches.
 
 On Saturday, state forest minister   raised the issue, squarely blaming the Sasikala family for the death. He questioned the rationale behind not allowing any political leader to visit Jayalalithaa when she was hospitalised. Srinivasan's cabinet colleague   too raised the issue of Jayalalithaa's death, in an apparent bid to corner Dhinakaran. Those within the party as well as outside see these statements as a measure to silence Dhinakaran, despite the fact that the latter himself had agreed for a thorough probe.
