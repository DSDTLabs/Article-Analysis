KOLKATA: A special Alipore Pocso court has allowed police to add the stringent section 6 of the Pocso Act, which deals with aggravated sexual assault, in the south Kolkata school student molestation case on Tuesday. The court also dismissed the bail of accused dance teacher   stating that granting of bail at this stage “will leave the child traumatized”. The court sent the accused to two more days of police custody after the cops submitted that they needed more time to question him based on the   footages.

 The court observed that besides the abuse of power by a schoolteacher as explained under the relevant Pocso provisions, the police have forwarded section 164 statement of the girl — a Class II student — and her medical report that shows this new section is necessary. The police had initially charged the accused under   section 506 (threat) and section 10 of the Pocso Act.
 
 Rana broke down inside the court in front of his mother. “For 11 days, he remained in police custody. Now suddenly when the confidential statements of the girl and her parents were recorded and the police have not managed to even carry out the reconstruction of the crime, they are adding this section as an afterthought. We thus apply for bail,” said the defence lawyers. The court later sent the teacher to police custody till February 22.
 
 In the other school abuse case from south Kolkata that involved a Class IX student, police got permission to record CrPC 164 statement of the three other girls present with the survivor when the incident took place.
