TRICHY: Girls account for less than 20 per cent in engineering colleges, said secretary general of Association of Indian Universities Furqan  , stressing the need for proactive measures to make higher education accessible to all sections of society. He said that inclusion and equality still remain a major concern.

 Qamar also sought to address regional imbalances with affordable education by building new institutions. Addressing the student gathering at   (NIT), Trichy on Tuesday as a part of   Day celebrations, Qamar coined three primary goals that have to be achieved for the development of higher education.
 
 He said that there is need for expanding higher education system to a level where we meet demands. “Only 25 per cent of the population in the relevant age group of 18-24 years have access to education in the country despite 42,000 educational institutions, which is perhaps the single largest system in the world. There is need for new institutions to mitigate regional imbalances which is the reason for low gross enrolment ratio,” he said.
 
 Qamar also stressed the need for more faculty members while stating that foreign institutions have over 2,000 faculty members per institute and that only 300 institutions in India have the same number of faculty. Funding is another concern as institutions are funded abysmally low when compared to western countries, he said. 
 
 NIT-T director   said the institute is the best among all 31 NITs and hold the 11th rank among all engineering institutions in the country, as per the recent   ( ) 2018 by the ministry of human resource development. She appraised that NIT-T was placed 23rd among the institutions in India and 228th position in Asia as per QS Asia ranking.
 
 Certificates and medals were also distributed to meritorious students across departments, covering both undergraduate and postgraduate programmes. C Nagamani, dean (Academic), presented a report on the achievements of the institute.
