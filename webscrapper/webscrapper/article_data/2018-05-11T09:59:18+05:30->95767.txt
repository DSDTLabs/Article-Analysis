KOCHI: For  , a porter from Idukki in Kerala, the WiFi at the Ernakulum junction railway station is enough to study. 

 
 Sreenath is awaiting the rank list of a last grade servant level test of the Kerala public service commission and he says that he is expecting at least 82% in the exams, thanks to audio classes available online.
 
 "The trains getting late is a usual thing most days. Sometimes when a 12am train comes at 3 in the wee hours, then I have an easy three hours to go thorough PDF study material. Even when the train arrives and my work starts, I switch to audio books using earphones. It is hard to work and study side to side but technology is making it easier," says Sreenath.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Sreenath who hails from Idukki has a one-year-old daughter. "I became an authorised porter at the railway station after passing a required physical test. It's been five years since I've been carrying head load. I hope I get a good rank in the PSC test so that I could support my family and my daughter," says Sreenath.
 
  
 To friends of Sreenath, his achievements are moments of glory. "Earnings from being a porter are obviously peanuts. There are people among us who work all their life to become physically unfit for the job one day. Amid all our agony, Sreenath is our ray of hope," says Assi, another porter at Ernakulum junction.
 
  
  
 
  He adds, It is a grand sight to watch him at work with a heavy load on his head and that ear phone in his years preparing him for tomorrow.
