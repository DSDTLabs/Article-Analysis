SHIMLA: Despite declaring monkeys as vermins within municipal limits of Shimla and 38 tehsils of the state outside the forest area, no monkeys have been killed in   in the past one year. While the period granted by Union ministry of environment and forests for declaring monkeys as vermin ended on May 24, state government has been making fresh attempts to extend the duration. CPI(M) has alleged that Congress due to its lacklustre approach failed in curbing the monkey menace.

 CPI(M) leader Dr   said as state government failed to tackle the monkey problem, farmers in the state had decided to protect their crops at their own and in the process three of them lost their lives. He said instead of killing the monkeys, state forest minister announced to increase the amount to catch monkeys to Rs 500. It was quite shocking that instead of doing the job itself, state government had asked the farmers, who form 90% of the population with no gun license, to kill monkeys. “Instead of declaring them as vermin, Government of India should allow the export of monkeys,” he said.
 
 State government in a high powered meeting chaired by chief minister   on April 10 had decided to constitute   for the scientific culling of monkeys in 38 tehsils and sub tehsils where monkeys have been declared vermin. Singh during the meeting said the government has decided to open ‘Rescue Centre for Life Care’ near Shimla as monkey menace has caused much damage to crops and fruits, along with harm to women and children in particular.
