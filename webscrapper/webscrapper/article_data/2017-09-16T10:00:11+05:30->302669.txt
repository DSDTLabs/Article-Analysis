JAIPUR: There are at least 10 government MBBS (in-service)  , who after completing PG from medical colleges, have not resumed services.   said that if they do not join for duty, they would write to the   (RMC) to suspend their registration.

 Health department’s additional director (gazetted) Dr O P Thankan said they were selected for PG courses on the quota for in-service doctors in medical colleges. They took the benefit of the quota for completing PG, but have not joined for duty yet.
 
 Recently, 176 doctors have completed their PG. But, only 166 have resumed duties till now. “We will write to RMC to cancel their licence if they do not join for duty. We will issue notices to them soon,” Dr Thankan said.
 
 As per norms, in-service doctors, who take the benefit of quota for PG admissions, have to work in government hospitals after completing their PG.
 
 In 2016 too, the health department had written to RMC to suspend licences of 19 doctors, including five specialists in radio diagnosis. These 19 doctors, earlier posted in government hospitals, had only MBBS when they joined. But they took admissions for the PG course under the government quota for in-service doctors (working in rural areas).
 
 This year too, in-service doctors have benefitted from various norms, including that of incentive marks given on the duration of service in government hospitals in rural and remote areas.
 
 Out of the top 200 ranks in the provisional merit list, issued by the NEET counselling board and SMS Medical College for post-graduation courses in 2017, 199 of them were secured by in-service doctors, who worked in government hospitals in difficult areas.
 
 But, when they pass out from medical colleges after completing their PG, they have to work in government hospitals.
