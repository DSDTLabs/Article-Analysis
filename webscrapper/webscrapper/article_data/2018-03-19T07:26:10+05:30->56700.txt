CHANDIGARH: Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), on Sunday, alleged a multi-crore scam in the   health department. Hisar MP Dushyant Chautala alleged malpractices in the procurement of medicines, medical and disposable surgical items in six districts since the BJP government took over. 

 Armed with information procured under the Right To Information Act (RTI) Act, Dushyant alleged that medicines and equipment worth Rs 300 crore was purchased by an unauthorised committee.
 
 The RTI also exposed that a Hisar-based company, the owner of which ran a karyana store, was given medicine orders. The owner is lodged in Tihar jail in a fake coin manufacturing case. 
 
 "All this shows how officers and those involved in the process of procuring medicines minted money. You cannot rule out the involvement of a CMO and health minister's office (HMO) in the scam. So far, we could quantify Rs 100 crore scam and this would have gone up to Rs 300 crore had we received RTI replies from Gurgaon and  ,'' said Dushyant Chautala.
 
 There's more, he said. "This is just the tip of the iceberg. Procurement has been made under the heads of   (NHM) and  . We shall ask the government to investigate and recommend a CBI probe," he said, adding that they would wait till Tuesday, after which he would approach the office of the CBI director and hand over documents for the probe.
 
 According to the document accessed by TOI, the Fatehabad office of the civil surgeon procured a face mask for Rs 4.9 per piece against the government purchase tender rate of 95 paisa per piece. The Fatehabad office also purchased cotton rolls for Rs 140 against the rate of Rs 99. Hand sanitiser was procured for Rs 325 against the approved rate of Rs 185.
 
 Documents showed that a few drugs and medical equipment was procured through a company which did not possess a drug licence. "The company owner is behind bars and payment has been withdrawn by the relative of an official of Haryana," he said.
