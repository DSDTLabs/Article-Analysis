Talking about his aspirations, Adhvay says, 'I have always wanted to act. It was when I saw   and saw  's mastery over his craft that I was inspired to go and learn from the same place that he learned his craft. This was when I discovered that people who inspired me, like him and   were all alumni of this school and I worked towards getting into it. I told my father that I want to be completely confident before I enter films, even though he was ready to launch me already.'
