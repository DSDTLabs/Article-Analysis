PANAJI: The suspense continues over former Congressman and former St Cruz   Atanasio (Babush) Monserrate’s re-entry into the Congress party to contest the Panaji byelection against chief minister Manohar Parrikar.

 Despite swirling speculations that   has sought the ouster of   ( ) president Luizinho Faleiro, Congress office bearers say that Monserrate has not laid any conditions for returning to the Congress fold.
 
 “He has showed his willingness to join and contest,”   secretary and Goa desk in-charge A Chellakumar said, adding that officially he had not received any conditions from Monserrate.
 
 Recently, 14 MLAs met with Monserrate at his residence and urged him to return to the Congress and take on Parrikar in the capital. Speaking to STOI, Monserrate had said that he was yet to take a final call on contesting against the former defence minister, but asserted that if he contested the bypoll, he would do it on a Congress ticket.
 
 “He has confirmed his joining the party. He is ready to re-join the party and no MLA has any objection to it,” a senior   said.
 
 Sources within the Congress and close to Monserrate confirmed that discussions were moving in a positive direction, but suggested that a formal announcement was unlikely in the near future.
 
 “There is time. The election has not been announced and there are panchayat polls before that. There is no time frame fixed for the decision,” Chellakumar said.
 
 However, political observers suggested that given Monserrate’s chequered record with Parrikar, it was still too premature to conclude that Monserrate would challenge the chief minister in the latter’s bastion.
 
 Congressmen, who have pinned their hopes on Monserrate to unsettle Parrikar’s coalition government, say that he requires Congress to remain politically relevant. Monserrate lost the Panaji elections against Sidharth Kuncalienker and remains without a constituency for the first time in his political career.
