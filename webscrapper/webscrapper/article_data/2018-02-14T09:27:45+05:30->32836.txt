DHARAMSHALA: Army jawan  , whose elderly parents and wife were attacked by Rattan Chand, an employee with the irrigation and public health (I&PH) department with a sharp axe earlier this month, has taken leave from duty to come and protect his family as the accused is yet to be arrested.

 The video of the incident had gone viral on the social media. Singh, who is posted in Srinagar (J&K) with the Sikh Regiment, told TOI that he was forced to take leave for protection of his family. “I have no trust in the system. On July 13 last year, I had written a letter to the police telling them about the threat from this man. But it was not taken seriously and it resulted in injuries to my whole family,” he alleged.
 
 When contacted, DSP Rajinder Sharma said they had taken action on the complaint and matter in this regard was submitted with the local court on 26th of the same month.
 
 Singh has returned with another soldier from his Dadh village in Kangra district.
 
 He alleged that the accused, in connivance with his contacts, had got himself admitted to the psychiatric department of the hospital on grounds of mental illness.
 
 “If he is not mentally stable, why was he not suspended from the job? Why didn’t he ever attack his own family? Why only my family?” said the soldier.
 
 Singh’s sister Sunita Kumari, who is married, said, “Who will protect our family? I can’t stay with parents and my brother remains away on duty. We can’t go to the court or police stations, somebody should help us”.
 
 Meanwhile, superintendent of police Santosh Patial said they could only arrest the accused on the advice of the doctors after he was released from the hospital.
 
 Dr Sukhjeet, the head of the psychiatric department, refused to divulge details.
 
 Singh’s father  , mother Basanti Devi and wife   were attacked earlier this month. The case under sections 452, 323, 506, 504 and 307 of the IPC has been registered by the police but the accused has not been arrested.
