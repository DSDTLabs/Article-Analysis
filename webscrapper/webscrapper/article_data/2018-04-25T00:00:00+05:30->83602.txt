This   last Sunday evening was quite a grand one, for, it was attended by several known personalities in the city, including film stars and politicos. The entire venue was elegantly decorated with a lot of floral arrangements. Live music amped up the celebration mood and the musicians treated the guests to a slew of retro numbers. After sharing pleasantries with each other, the guests walked up to the bride and groom —   — to wish them a happy beginning. It was a memorable evening for all, giving a break to their professional commitments and bonding with one another.
