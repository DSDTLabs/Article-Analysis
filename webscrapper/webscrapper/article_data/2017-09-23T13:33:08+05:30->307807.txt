BHOPAL:   is again in news for the wrong reasons. A woman professor has dragged the board to the state women's commission after it misplaced an important evidence confiscated by her under use of unfair means during an exam.

 Talking to TOI, Prof Maya Rathi, who is with economics department at MLB said, she was assigned job as observer during a jail guard exam conducted by Vyapam on July 22, 2017. “During the exam, I caught a student using a small recorder device to cheat.” The exam was conducted at an engineering college in Ratibad.
 
 “In the presence of other invigilators, I had sealed the evidence in an envelope and sent it to the Vyapam office,” she said.
 
 But, trouble for the professor began from September 15. “Almost two months after the exam, I received a call that the recorder, which was the sole evidence in cheating case, was missing from Vyapam. I was shocked," said  .
 
 “Due to their negligence, they misplaced the evidence and threatened to take action against me for being irresponsible.”
 
 “It was humiliating for a teacher like me, who has conducted several exams in past two decades without any trouble,” she said.
 
 She claimed that Vyapam officials kept on pressuring her for ‘producing’ the recorder. “I spoke to the other invigilators who were on duty at the college and they were all ready to support me. As they came in my favour, I countered Vyapam and told them that I would lodge a complaint against them for misplacing the evidence and putting the onus for the laxity on me.”
 
 Soon after, “On September 19, I got a call from Vyapam that the recorder was recovered and Vyapam has no issue with the me. Would they had spared if the article was not found?”
 
 Thereafter filed a complaint with the higher education department, women's commission and also chief minister  .
 
 When contacted, Vyapam's exam controller AKS Bhadoriya said he has not received any complaint on the issue.
