A large number of tourists, especially from neigbouring states, drive down for   as liquor is considerably cheaper in Goa.

 “As it is we are swamped with customers throughout the day and I’m sure the number of customers will increase after April 1,” a retail shop owner said, requesting anonymity. “Our area might become like Delhi where people get into fights while jostling in the crowd in front of liquor shops,” the shop owner, who coincidently hails from Delhi, said.
 
 Others are licking their lips in anticipation of increased business. “We are not in favour of liquor outlets near highways being closed. But their closing down will mean more business for us,” a bar owner in Calangute said. On Thursday, excise commissioner Menino D’Souza, who heads the state-level committee, said that notices will be issued to the highway bars after February 28. Sources said that around 300 bars will face closure along state and national highways.
