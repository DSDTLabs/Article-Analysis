CUTTACK: Prime Minister   on Saturday accused rival parties of ganging up to protect dynasty politics and said his government runs on people's mandate, and not at the directions from Janpath. 

 " Hamari sarkar kisi Janpath se nehin, janmat se chal rahi hai. (Our government doesn't run from Janpath. It works on people's mandate)," Modi said at a rally in   on Saturday in an oblique reference to the Gandhi family. He was here to mark the NDA government's four years in power at the Centre. 
 
 Referring to the show of strength by various political parties at the swearing-in ceremony of   chief minister H D Kumaraswamy, Modi said, "The fear of our government's move to crack down on black money has brought many to a common platform." He added, "Four former chief ministers are in jail. Those involved in a Rs 5,000-crore scam and are now on bail and many such people are coming together. This is not meant to save the country, but their families." 
 
 Looking back at the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Modi said the world was left spellbound when India chose a majority government after a gap of 30 years. This mandate, he said, has encouraged his government to take bold decisions in the interests of the nation and its people. 
 
 " Na hum kade faisle lene se darte hain, aur na hum kade faisle lene se chukte hain. Jab desh mein confusion nehin, commitment wali sarkar chalti hai, tabhi desh mein surgical strike jaise faisale lene ki taaqat rakhte hain. (We don't fear taking bold decisions. We don't miss any opportunity to take such decisions. When the country has a government which has commitment, and not confusion, it can have the courage to carry out surgical strikes." 
 
 Decisions like one rank, one pension and strong action against benami properties were possible only because his government is a committed one, the PM told a gathering of more than 30,000 people at the historic   ground here.
