VADODARA: They were not well-versed with operating an ATM. But two persons, who lost their cash to a swindler owing to their inability, somehow managed to catch the man days after he fleeced them. 

  and Mahesh Machhi had lost Rs 9,000 and Rs 10,000 from the   in   area on March 5. 
 
 On March 5, Parmar had gone to the ATM before boarding a bus for Dabhoi. As he did not know how to withdraw money, he took help of   who was standing nearby. After Parmar entered his personal identification number (PIN), Bharwad told him that there was no money in the ATM and asked him to withdraw cash from another ATM. In fact, Bharwad had entered the amount but did not press the ‘enter’ button. Parmar remained unaware about this.
 
 Police said that as Parmar was in a hurry, he boarded the bus and left for Dabhoi. After sometime, he received an sms that Rs 9,000 was withdrawn from his account. On Thursday, Parmar approached the branch manager of Union Bank of India to see the CCTV camera footage and check if it was Bharwad who had withdrawn money or somebody else. 
 
 When they were checking the footage, another victim Machhi too came to the branch manager with the complaint that he had also lost Rs 10,000 in a similar way. He also found that Bharwad had cheated him similarly.
 
 On Saturday, Macchi and Parmar’s son Chirag kept a watch outside the ATM. When Bharwad reached there, the duo nabbed him and handed him to the Wadi police.
 
 When the police searched Bharwad’s house on Waghodiya Road, they found Rs 37,000 from there.
