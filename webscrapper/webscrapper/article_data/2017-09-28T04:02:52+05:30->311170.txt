Mumbai: Founder of the troubled  , cardiac surgeonDr K R Shetty, passed away on Tuesday ni- ght. He was 86.

 The hospital, which was often touted as the first dedicated heart institute in the city’s private sector, was the birthplace of late Prime Minister   in 1944. It was then a nursing home, but Dr Shetty transformed it into a heart hospital after he purchased it in the 70s. At present, the hospital is in a limbo. Its trustees are reportedly in talks with a business family for its sale. Doctors have stopped visiting the hospital due to non-payment of dues, while some nurses and support staffers visit it mainly for their back wages.
 
 Association of Medical Consultant president Dr Smita Sharma said messages were sent to all members on Wednesday about Dr Shetty’s   and his funeral which was held at 3pm at  . 
 
 Dr Shetty was also associated with the state-run JJ Hospital’s cardiothoracic surgery until the early 90s. “He was head of cardiac surgery when I headed the cardiology department,” says cardiologist Dr B K Goyal. “We often had tea together while discussing angiograms of patients. His greatest contribution was setting up a good hospital for cardiac care back then.” tnn
