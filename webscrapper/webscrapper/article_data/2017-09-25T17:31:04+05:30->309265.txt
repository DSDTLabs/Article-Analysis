The historical drama 'Chandra Nandini' is to be wrapped up this November and a new show, Namish Taneja's  , is about to take its place.
 
 As known to most, 'Chandra Nandini' tells the tale of Chandragupta Maurya and his wife Nandini. We hear that the story will end with Chandragupta Maurya turning into a Buddhist monk. The reason for the shows discontinuation could be its dwindling ratings.
  
 This end will lead to a new beginning. Producer Suzana Ghai's family drama 'Ikyavann' is all set to take the Chandra Nandini's slot. 'Ikyavann', set in Ahmedabad, tells the tale of a tall girl who is the 51st (Ikyavann) child in the family. According to Hindu norms, she is considered lucky!
