Mumbai:   Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said it’s a matter of concern that the judge hearing a review petition filed by Sohrabuddin’s brother against the discharge of IPS officers D G Vanzara, Dinesh M N and Rajkumar Pandian has been assigned new work. 

 The judge was also hearing acquittals of Gujarat cadre IPS officer M K Amin and Rajasthan constable Dalpat Singh Rathod. “All these cases were heard on a day-to-day basis. During the course of hearing, the judge had observed that the CBI was not cooperating in the case and that the judge had even lifted the ban on covering the encounter case,” Sawant said in a statement.
 
 Sawant claimed that while the Supreme Court had recommended that the entire case should be heard by only one judge, Justice J T Utpat, who was hearing the encounter case, was abruptly shifted and it was entrusted to Justice Brijgopal Loya, who died under mysterious circumstances. Subsequently, BJP chief Amit Shah was given a clean chit in the case.
