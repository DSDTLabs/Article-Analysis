Bambolim: A comprehensive metal recycling policy, currently being prepared by the   Aayog and ministry of steel, could see the light of day in the coming months. 

 Addressing industry representatives and the Metal Recycling Association of India at the International Indian Metals Recycling Conference, held at a resort on the outskirts of Goa’s capital, Niti Aayog member Vijay Kumar Saraswat, said deliberations over the policy were moving in the right direction.
 
 “There has been some discussion over the last 6-7 months and there is movement in the right direction. We should hear something in the coming days,” Saraswat said. He was speaking in the presence of Union minister for steel Chaudhary Birender Singh, and Union minister for mines Narendra Singh Tomar.
 
 “There is a major need for all of us to put our heads together to prepare a quality draft recycling policy,” Saraswat said, adding that the average recycling rate in countries like Germany, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Turkey, Australia and the USA was over 80%, while India’s was merely 20%.
 
 As per initial discussions, the policy aims to incentivise use of scrap metal by allowing people to sell junked items to registered scrap dealers at pre-determined prices. 
 
 Speaking later at the conference, Bhirender Singh said the proposed Motor Vehicles Bill, if passed, could see vehicles over 15 years old being scrapped
