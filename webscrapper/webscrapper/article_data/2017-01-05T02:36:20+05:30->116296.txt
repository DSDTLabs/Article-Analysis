NEW DELHI: Both   and Kantha Anand saw death up-close on Wednesday. Though admitted to a hospital with spinal injuries, Joyal, who managed to crawl out of his overturned WagonR, is stable. Anand is also recuperating. 

 Joyal, who works at a prominent school in  , was leaving home to meet a relative. “I had just driven out of the complex and was waiting for the woman to cross. She was checking her mobile phone while waiting for a rickshaw. Suddenly the Ertiga skidded and hit her. As she was thrown against my car, the Ertiga also rammed mine. Before I could realise, my car overturned.” 
 
 Joyal said he could hear the woman calling for help from under the vehicle. “If it was not for locals and a police team nearby, the situation could have been worse.” 
 
 Locals said the teenager, who was probably drunk, lost control of the vehicle near Pink Apartment. “It seemed that the car running at a high speed had its axle ripped off after which the teenager lost the control,” said a RWA member who was present at the spot during the accident.
 
 Anand’s son,  , said, “She has severe injuries in the lower part of the body but her head was saved miraculously. .
