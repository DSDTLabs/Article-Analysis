PUNE: The entire staff at Yerawada ward office were put to work by independent candidate   who filed his nomination on Thursday. He had brought with him two big steel plates filled with coins amounting to Rs 5,000 which he paid for the deposit. 

 Poll officials at Yerawada ward office had a tough time counting all the Re 1, Rs 2 and Rs 5 coins Jadhav piled up on their table. Jadhav said he had collected the coins as donations from voters during campaigning since he was poor. He walked into the ward office with an entourage of supporters. 
 
 Election officials inside the ward said, “This was the first time someone walked into our office with so many coins. We cannot refuse to take them and told the entire staff of five members to help us count them. It took us almost two-and-half hours to finish counting.”
 
 Jadhav, who runs the   in Dhanori area, ward number 1, will be contesting the   for the first time.
 
 “Whenever I would go to campaign for myself along with supporters, I would collect the coins from voters. I kept it safe for my election deposit. People feel those who do not have money cannot contest elections. But I wanted to prove a point. There are leaders like   and many others who have won bigger elections without spending any money. A clean character, the will to serve and the urge to work for the people is the only driving force.”
 
 Pune Municipal Corporation's election officer   said, "There is no such rule on acceptance of money in a certain denomination. All legal currency whether in coins or notes can be accepted. Coins are a legal tender too.”
