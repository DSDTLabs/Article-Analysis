Mirror (April 21) had earlier reported that   is setting up a restaurant in London with her mother   that will open its doors by August-end. We have now learnt that the 25-year-old  , who owns a house in Bandra, is looking for a bigger place so she can get herself some pet dogs. Also, since her mother travels with her for shoots and events she wants them to have a home in the city. Ask her if she's had any luck yet with the house hunting and Amy says from London, "Unfortunately I am hardly in India these days as I am shooting for 'Boogie Man', an Indo-English film. But I'm planning a trip to Mumbai soon."

  
  
 The Brit beauty can already see the house in her mind - lots of white walls and flowers, a garden and a cute kennel in the corner for her dogs. "I recently bought a house in Chennai and now I am searching for one in Mumbai. It's wise to invest in properties," she asserts.
