Madurai: The sprawling   building inaugurated by late chief minister J Jayalalithaa in March last year will now house a library at a cost of Rs 4 crore. This building has remained idle since its inauguration.

 Minister for school education, K A Sengottaiyan who spoke to reporters after inspecting the building on Saturday, informed that the move to establish a library in the building was aimed at enhancing the educational opportunities for students not just from Madurai, but also from the southern districts.
 
 He said the building was of pride to Madurai, as it stood as an example to the rich culture and heritage of the region. It was the brainchild of the founder of the AIADMK M G Ramachandran and the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa had fulfilled his dream by allocating Rs 25 crore funds and inaugurating the same. Once established, the library would help students including those aspiring to enter the IAS or IPS services and efforts would also be taken to promote it as a tourist attraction, he added.
 
 Steps would also be taken to showcase the heritage of the region by adequately providing information with regard to epics like Silapathigaram, Manimekalai, heroes like Veerapandya Kattabomman, Vellaiya Thevar, Marudupandiar, Velu Nachiar among others, he added.
 
 Ministers Sellur K Raju, R B Udayakumar, Sevoor S Ramachandran, MLAs V V Rajan Chellappa, A K Bose, collector K Veera Raghava Rao among others were present.
