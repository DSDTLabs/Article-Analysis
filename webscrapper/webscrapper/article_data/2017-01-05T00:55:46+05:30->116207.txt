New Delhi: After leopard pug marks sighted at Asola Bhatti Wildlife Sanctuary last year, increase in number of golden jackals has become the latest indicator of flourishing ecosystem in the sanctuary. Conservation Education Centre (CEC) with Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) will be holding the first-ever ‘golden jackal safari’ on   to showcase the rise.

 Visitors, for Rs 400, will be able to go on a self-driven   to the interiors of the sanctuary to spot the animal. There will also be sessions on the ecology, feeding and reproduction behaviour of the animal.
 
 “Experts will guide the visitors about the jackal’s hideouts and where to spot them in the wild. It will be a learning opportunity and a chance to see these magnificent creatures up-close,” said an official.
 
 The number of animals has risen dramatically over the last few years because of the availability of a good prey-base, an official said. 
 
 “Jackals, being the largest hunting mammals present at the sanctuary, have no competition and hence, has seen a continuous rise in numbers. They are flexible feeders and are able to survive on whatever food is available around,” said Sohail Madan, wildlife conservator and centre manager, BNHS. 
 
 The   is an omnivore and opportunistic forager. While a portion of its diet includes Zizyphus nummularia — a flower found in abundance at Asola — it can also feed on birds, rodents, fruits, insects and fish. They are also capable of living alone or in small groups.
