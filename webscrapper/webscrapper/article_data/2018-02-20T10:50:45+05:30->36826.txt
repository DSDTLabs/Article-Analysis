MADURAI: One worker was killed and the foreman of the factory sustained severe burn injuries in a blast at a fireworks making unit at Kundalapatti in   police limits of   district on Monday evening. The blast reduced seven buildings to rubble and torched 23 buildings inside the factory premises. 

 Considering the structural damage that the factory suffered, the workers had a providential escape since it happened when the shift was almost winding up around 5 pm. Most workers had left while the remaining ones got the time to flee on hearing the blast, police sources said.
 
 Police were still trying to ascertain the identity of the dead worker or woman who was charred beyond recognition in the accident that occurred in one of the chemical mixing rooms. The injured has been identified as A Prabhu, 50 from   in Sivakasi, foreman of the unit. He had sustained nearly 60 percent burn injuries and was rushed to the centre of excellence to treat burn injuries at   Government Hospital. Police suspect that careless handling of ‘manimarundhu’ (pellets made of chemical cocktail that gives colourful effects to fireworks) would have triggered the accident since the workers were winding up the shift.   might have been supervising the final leg of works before closing down the factory. 
 
 In normal circumstances, the foreman would be held responsible and booked by police for negligence, while the owners remain at large. In this case, the foreman himself is a victim. “We are trying to identify the deceased based on information collected from fellow workers. The foreman has suffered severe injuries and is under treatment”, a police official said. 
 
 The fireworks unit belongs to R Ganesan, 50 from   and is a larger one licensed by Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organization, Nagpur. Had the blast happened during peak hours, the damage to life would have been really large, police say. Amathur police have registered a case and investigating further.
