Vadodara: Members of the Vidhyarthi Hit Rakshak Samiti who were scheduled to submit memorandums regarding admission fees collected in the schools to all MLAs at Gandhinagar were detained by the cops early on Tuesday morning. 

 Three members of the samiti including M S University’s senate member Nikul Patel, Sai Dekhane and Chirag Kadiya were first called at police stations late on Monday night to record their statements. Later, they were again detained early on Tuesday morning.
 
 “All we wanted was to submit a memorandum to MLAs of the state so that the practice of collecting admission fees, capitation fees and deposits by the schools which is in violation of the Right to Education Act is stopped. But we were detained by the cops before we could start for Gandhinagar,” said Patel, who was detained by the Fatehgunj police. 
 
 “This clearly shows that although we are called a democracy, we cannot even make peaceful representation before our elected representatives,” he said. 
 
 The samiti members since quite some time have been making representations before the district collectors, MLAs of Vadodara and Vadodara MP asking them to ensure that the Right to Education Act which prohibits collecting admission fees and taking interviews of parents for admitting their wards should be strictly implemented. 
 
 “Other members of our samiti however managed to reach Gandhinagar and make representations before the MLAs. While most of the MLA did agree that the rule should be strictly enforced, some of them were not aware about the provisions of the law,” said Dekhane, who alleged that cops kept moving him from one police station to another till Tuesday evening.
