Ahmedabad: The Gujarat State Higher Secondary Teacherâ€™s Federation has organized a one-day seminar on Saturday on new course, new examination system and new education policy for science teachers of Class XI and XII.

 The one-day seminar will be inaugurated by education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma. The teachers will also be given training on how to teach physics, chemistry and mathematics. Sources in the federation said the teachers will also be taught how to teach topics which they find it difficult.
 
 The sources said that they had decided to allow teachers to register online. So far, about 2,500 teachers across the state have registered. The teachers will be taught how to teach students to crack Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test.
 
 Students from Gujarat fail to put up a good show in the national competitive examinations. Hence the teachers will be taught to focus on certain topics. tnn
