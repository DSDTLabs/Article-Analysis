 Raking up the 1984 anti-Sikh riots does not change the atmosphere as much water has flown under the bridge. "In the riots (after assassination of then prime minister Indira Gandhi), it was a mob that went berserk and not the political party. Members of the mob have joined different political parties and all are not in Congress," added Sewa. He also feels that coalition with   will help Congress regain some of its lost turf.
 
  Though thousands of Sikhs who have made Palia their home have decided to move on after Operation Blue Star (military entered Golden Temple in Amritsar to flush out terror accused, arms and ammunition), they have not forgotten Punjab.

 Satnam's father and Sewa's son Fateh is a confused man. He has been an ardent Congress supporter but is struggling to decide where to place his trust. "The local BJP candidate has stood by us through thick and thin. I also support Modi's development agenda but at the same time I feel the party has been trying to vitiate atmosphere in western UP," said Fateh. 
 
 Satnam plays peacemaker as the discussion heats up. "Just follow your instincts. When political leaders can switch sides and join new parties, voters should not hesitate in doing the same. Support a candidate who will be accessible and work for us," he said.
