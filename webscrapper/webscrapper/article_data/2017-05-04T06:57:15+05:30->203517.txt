THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The vigilance special judge here on Wednesday ordered expert medical examination of the two retired of health service officials, who, after being sentenced to jail for graft, got admitted to a hospital. The judge, A Badarudeen, gave the order while considering a report filed by the police.

 The judge directed the director of Sri Chitra Institute of Medical Science and Technology to depute a specialist doctor to examine them and file a report.
 
  and K Shylaja, who had both served as director of health services, were sentenced to five years of imprisonment on Tuesday for corruption to the tune of Rs 1.49 crore they committed in 2002 in the name of a non-existent Hepatitis-B immunisation drive. Rajan was the director of health service and Shylaja, Thiruvananthapuram district medical officer, when the crime was committed.
 
 After the court sentence, both Rajan and Shylaja complained of physical illness, following which the police took them to the government hospital at Fort. The doctor who consulted them said that both had high blood pressure and referred them to the   (MCH), where they were admitted to in the night.
 
 On Wednesday, the police filed a report before the court sans any report of the MCH doctors. The judge expressed his displeasure and questioned the authenticity of the report. He also expressed his doubt over the possibility of the doctor helping the two convicts to remain in the hospital.
 
 The judge held that if it was found that their illness was a ploy to outsmart the legal system, then everyone involved in this may have to face strong action.
 
 The court will be examining the doctor, who is attending to the two convicts in the Medical College Hospital, on Thursday, in connection with the developments.
