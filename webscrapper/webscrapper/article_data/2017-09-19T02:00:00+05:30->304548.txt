PATNA: Union minister for state (independent charge) for power R K Singh on Monday explained the difficulties in executing ‘one India-one tariff’ demand of the state government.

 Singh said though the   government is committed to ‘One India, one grid’ plan, the central power generation units mostly sell 60-70% of their output to different states under power purchase agreements (PPA).
 
 Sources said the tariff rates for power generated at National Thermal Power Corporation Limited ( ) and National Hydroelectric Power Corporation ( ) primarily depend on two factors — the cost at which the plant was set up and the type of coal, imported or indigenous, being used by it.
 
 “The central units enter into long-term PPAs with states for its 60-70% of power. The remaining 30% power is available at uniform rate for all who wish to buy it. Hence, power is already available at uniform rate when purchased through open market,” Singh explained.
 
 “The central units enter into PPAs right from the time of commencement of works on installing the power plant in order to recover the running cost even during the gestation period (from commencement of construction works till commissioning of the plant). It has been seen that the rates at which   enters into PPA with central plants are comparatively higher. Accordingly, the state government has been demanding uniform tariff,” a senior energy department official said. 
 
 On August 13, chief minister   had pitched for uniform power tariff rates across the country on the lines of railway fare. “Our energy minister and officials have raised the issue with the Centre … NTPC should fix a uniform tariff for the entire country,”   had said.
