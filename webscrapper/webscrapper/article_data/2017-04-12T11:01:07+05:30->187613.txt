 Benjamin, who made his debut as a music composer with the film  , has now come out with a single for Lent (a period of 40 days before Easter according to the Christian calendar). Its music has an Arabic touch and the composer says, “I wanted to keep it that way to make it gel well with the situation. This English song is about the human aspect of Jesus Christ. In fact, the chorus has a few Aramaic words and we’ve even used Arabic instruments in the song. While I synced the sound of oud (an Arabic instrument) on keyboard, darbuka (another Arabic instrument) was played by Darbuka Siva. And Aalaap Raju played the guitar. The song was sung by  , a choir that I am part of and I composed the song based on each of our vocal ranges.”

 Talking about the response for his debut movie Kanavu Variyam, he says. “The response has been good, especially for the song   Manna. A lot of people told me that they could relate to it as the song is about the games that they played when they were kids. I am in talks to sign two other movies, but nothing is firmed up yet.”
