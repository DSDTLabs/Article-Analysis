His devotion towards his two dapper boys   and   is evident through his social media updates, where he keeps posting about his candid moments with them. Despite having a hectic work schedule, he ensures that he spends quality time with his boys.

 Recently, his older son Hrehaan celebrated his 12th birthday and Hrithik shared a motivational message for his boy which became viral on the internet. Now, as per latest reports, Hrithik has apparently devised a new technique to impart knowledge and teach his boys some important life lessons.
