NAVI MUMBAI: A 46-year-old   was robbed of her gold mangalsutra worth Rs 90,000 by a woman pillion rider near   mandir chowk in Panvel on Sunday afternoon.

 Madhuri Manohar Pashte had just crossed   chowk when a bike came close to her and a man riding the bike asked her for an address. The moment her attention was diverted, the woman pillion rider snatched the chain and sped away within seconds.
 
  The victim woman was taken aback and shouted for help but the biker had, by then, escaped in the bylanes.
 
 Women resorting to crimes is seemingly on the rise in the city. After the police arrested several women for peddling drugs, the city has also started witnessing a number of them involved in other crimes like chain snatchings. â€”George Mendonca
