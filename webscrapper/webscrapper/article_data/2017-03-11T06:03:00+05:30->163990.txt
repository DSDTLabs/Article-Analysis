BATHINDA: Police on Friday slapped murder charges against the mother of two children who died of exorcism at Kotfatta village in Bathinda district on Wednesday night. She has not been formally arrested but police questioned from her about her role in killings. 

 The other two accused in the murder case, the victims’ grandmother Nirmal Kaur and father  , who were taken into custody on Wednesday night, were produced on the court Talwandi Sabo   Ist class ( )   on Friday and sent in one day police remand.
 
 Ranjodh (5) and Anamika (3) were killed on March 8 when Kulwinder (30), a village carpenter’s helper, was carrying out this “purification ritual” for the third day in a row at the instance of his mother, who believed that the two children were possessed by demons. Nirmal, who claimed to possess divine powers, wanted to cure her mentally-retarded sister Prem Lata by thrashing and electrocuting the children. 
 
 Nirmal had called some some tantric at her residence, who suggested giving electric shocks to the kids. She followed it up with beating the kids for three days and giving them electric shocks. She was assisted by her son in all this. The mother and son used to lock the children’s mother Amarjit Kaur in a room when they performed the ritual. 
 
 Police officials said that though Amarjit would scream for help but no villager came to her rescue, initial probe suggested that she too had not made any effort to save the kids. 
 
 “Amrjit has been included in the case registered under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC at Kotfata police station,” Bathinda SP(Traffic), who is supervising the case, said.
