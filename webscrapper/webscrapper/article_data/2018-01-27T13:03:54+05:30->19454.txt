Chairperson of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC),   was invited to attend the ongoing   for the session, ‘Main aur Woh: Conversations with Myself’ on Sunday. However, he has decided to stay away from it and not attend the festival this year. The Rajput Karni Sena which led the protests against Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s film ‘Padmaavat’ had said that the   chairperson will not be allowed to enter Rajasthan as he had put the pride of Rajasthan at stake by certifying the film. 

  In an official statement Prasoon said, “Will not be attending JLF this year and must say will miss sharing great moments with literature and poetry lovers. I am doing this so that the dignity of the event does not get compromised or discomfort caused either to the organisers, fellow writers or the attendees. And also so that the lovers of literature get to focus on creativity and not controversy.” 
 
  Addressing the controversy surrounding ‘Padmaavat’, Prasoon added, “Speaking of which, the issue around the film   - I did my job and sincerely took a sensitive and balanced call. As I have said earlier, certification was done with due processes, incorporating valid suggestions whilst staying mindful to the concerns of the society as well as to the canvas of cinema. It’s sad that we are not relying on genuine peaceful dialogue. It’s important that we keep mutual trust and faith in each other and our institutions so that the issues don’t reach this far.”
 
  This is not the first time that an eminent person has stayed away from the Jaipur Literature Festival. Novelist Salman Rushdie didn’t attend the festival in 2012, after hundreds of Muslim activists protested against his visit.
