South actress Bhavana got engaged to her long time beau, Kannada actor and producer Naveen on Thursday. The ring exchange was held in a simple ceremony at her residence at her hometown, Thrissur. “The ceremony was supposed to be held on March 3 but the dates got pushed owing to deaths in the family. It’s not long since Naveen lost his mother and Bhavana her father,” says Bhavana’s mother Pushpa. “We meant to hold a simple ring exchange before the photos of the deceased, but Naveen’s family, who are Telugus settled in Bangalore, wanted to the rituals to be done according to their customs. So, garlands were exchanged which made some people think that it was her wedding.”

 Pushpa says that the family meant to keep it a secret and announce the wedding later on but the photos leaked somehow. “Only our close family were present. Nine people had come from Naveen’s family. Manju Warrier and Samyuktha Varma came only after knowing about it. But they come here often even otherwise.”
 
 The wedding will be held at the end of this year but nothing else including the venue, has been decided. “Both parties want a simple wedding. It might not be easy for Naveen’s entire family to come over here so they might be attending the reception. Also, she has films to complete before planning the wedding,” she says.
 
 Naveen is a producer and actor and the two met on the sets of the Kannada film Romeo in 2012. “They had plans to marry but Bhavana just kept evading when it would happen. Finally I made her fix the engagement,” says her mother, laughing. Bhavana will head to Scotland soon to shoot for her film Adam Joan, which has Prithviraj in the lead.
