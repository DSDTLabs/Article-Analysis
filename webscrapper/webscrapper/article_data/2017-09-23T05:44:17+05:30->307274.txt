CHENNAI: The income   department continued it searches in the five finance companies owned by relatives of former transport minister   in Karur for the second day on Friday. Based on documents seized in the searches, the department will collate the   recovered from these companies, I-T sources told TOI. 

 "Many of these companies used unaccounted money to give loans to businessmen as well as individuals. Apart from giving loans from unaccounted money, the companies have also evaded tax after receiving income as interest from these loans," a senior I-T official told TOI.
 
 The companies are owned by relatives of the former minister but neither the minister nor his brother who has several business in the state are part of the searches. "We are covering Karur-based concerns involved in money lending in unaccounted cash, textiles & civil contracts. Totally we searched 9 premises in Karur under section 132 of the   Act. Apart from searches, we also surveyed 15 premises under section 133A of the Act," said the official.
 
 Coimbatore investigation wing is in charge of the searches. "We are yet to collate the number of documents seized from the 9 premises. Apart from documents, we also seized some cash from these premises and it will take some time before we come to know the unaccounted money used by these companies to give loans as well as the total  ," the official said.
