LUCKNOW: The   strike against   has dealt a loss of over Rs 50 crore to the   of Lucknow in past three weeks. According to traders in the city, fabric and yarn used for   and   garments comes from Surat and because all the mills in the Gujarat city were closed, there has been no supply since the GST rollout. 

 “2 lakh meters cloth is required for zardozi every month for 20,000 sarees and 10,000 suit lengths, while remaining fabric is used for making lehengas and men’s kurtas. The embroidered garments sell at an average cost of Rs 2,000 per piece and prices vary according to quality of work. But for the past three weeks, all business has come to a halt as we are not able to obtain any raw material,” said Raza Imam, a zardozi merchant, adding, “The industry in the city has suffered a loss of over Rs 35 crore since July 1.” 
 
 Besides fabric and thread, material for embellishment comprising ‘kardana’, ‘nakshi’, mirrors and stones used in zari and zardozi work are not available either. Chikan industry has also suffered to a great extent. “Our annual turnover is Rs 300-350 crore but since July 1, not only has the sale gone down, no new cloths are being manufactured. As of now, traders have incurred a loss of over Rs 25 crore in the last three weeks,” said Har Prasad Agarwal, vice president of Lucknow Chikankari Handicraft Association.
 
 Besides heavy monetary losses, the non-availability of raw material has rendered over 5 lakh artisans involved in both trades jobless.
