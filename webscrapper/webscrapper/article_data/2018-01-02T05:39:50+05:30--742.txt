NOIDA: The first day of new year was a harrowing one for commuters travelling towards Delhi from Noida and vice-versa via the DND Flyway and the Mahamaya Flyover. They got stuck in the peak rush hour traffic for almost two hours in the evening.

 Commuters encountered snarls at the Noida entry gate,   road, Shahdara drain and the carriageway along the TGIP Mall from 6 pm-8 pm.
 
 Those commuters travelling from Noida to Delhi were caught in snarls that took them almost half-an-hour to cross a stretch of two kilometres from the Noida entry gate.
 
 Those travelling on the road linking the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway with the Dadri main road and the Film City flyover too had to face snarls.
 
 Mahesh Singhal, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase I, told TOI that he was stuck for almost 20 minutes at the Noida entry gate at 7 pm. Traffic flow, however, normalised near the Rajnigandha intersection.
 
 The situation eased on the   stretch near the Noida entry gate after 7 pm. Commuters faced snarls on the Mahamaya Flyover to Sector 37 road too.
 
 Commuters returning to Noida from Delhi also shared their harrowing experience due to the massive jam that they faced near the India Gate.
 
 Anil Singh, who works in the  , said, “The India Gate circle was completely jammed. There was a jam at the   flyover also. I had to take the Bhogal-Jangpura route but still took around two-and-a-half hours to reach Noida.”
 
 “I left from Nirman Bhawan at 5.30 pm and reached Noida’s Sector 36 around 8.20 pm,” he added.
