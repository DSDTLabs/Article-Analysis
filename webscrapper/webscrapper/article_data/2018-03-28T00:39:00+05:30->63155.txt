Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court on Tuesday adjourned a case that sought a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) to take appropriate steps to hold election for the post of general secretary in the AIADMK. The court adjourned it by a week after questioning the petitioner as to how it can intervene in the issue. Regarding it, the petitioner may approach the civil court, if necessary, the court said.  One B Ramkumar Adityan from Tiruchendur filed the case. When the case came up for hearing before justice V Bharathidasan, the petitioner’s side told the court that on August 29, 2014, late J Jayalalithaa was appointed as general secretary of AIADMK and O Paneerselvam, Edappadi K Palaniswami, E Madhusudhanan were appointed as treasurer, party headquarters secretary and presidium chairman. After Jayalalithaa’s demise on December 5, the aforesaid three persons and top party cadre had to conduct election for the post of general secretary.  But, they conducted general council members meeting on December 29, 2016 appointing V K Sasikala as interim general secretary. After the Supreme Court’s order, she was lodged in jail in Bengaluru in an assets case on February 5, last year. Subsequently, they held another meeting on September 12, 2017 creating new posts of coordinator and joint coordinator. They appointed O Panneerselvam as coordinator and Edappadi K Palaniswami as joint coordinator besides giving general secretary powers to them. This was informed to the ECI during R K Nagar by poll.  The leaders’ actions were against the rules and regulations of the AIADMK party. Those meetings could not be recognised as the general council of the party.  Hence, representation was sent to the chief election commissioner to declare the appointment of Sasikala as general secretary of the AIADMK and to take steps to hold election to the post of general secretary of the party. But, there was no action, the petitioner’s side said.
