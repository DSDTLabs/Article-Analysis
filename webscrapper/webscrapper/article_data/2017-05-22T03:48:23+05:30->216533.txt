GANGTOK/NEW DELHI: Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday asked   ( ) and governments of Himalayan states to be vigilant against Chinese transgression, which happens due to perception differences.

 Singh called India’s relation with China “good” and said differences were being sorted out through bilateral discussions. “Due to perceptional differences, there have been transgression by the Chinese PLA in the past. Such incidents have come down now. Sometimes, armies of both countries come face to face which we call face-off. Such incidents are resolved through the existing mechanism,” he said at the meeting.
 
 “As we are aware India-China border is undemarcated, we have to be very vigilant while guarding the borders,” Singh said. He said thinning of population and migration from border areas was a cause of concern. “We need to strengthen basic infrastructure in border areas so that people don't migrate to other places looking for better opportunities,” he said.
