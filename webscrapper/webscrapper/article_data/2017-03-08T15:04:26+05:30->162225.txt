KOCHI: Following the arrest of   at Tirupati, the   (GSB) community is hopeful of return of the `Salagramams' and other relics to the Sri Kashi Mutt Samsthan, Varanasi. After a dispute with the senior pontiff   over the right to be pontiff, Raghavendra, who was the deputy pontiff, had allegedly decamped with the `Salagramams' that were being worshipped at the Mutt for centuries.

 Narayan Shenoy, a Bengaluru-based GSB community member expressed faith that Raghavendra's arrest would eventually lead to recovery of the idols. “The community has been fighting this case for the past 20 years. His refusal to part with certain essential religious paraphernalia belonging to the Mutt is highly objectionable,“ he said.
 
 After the death of Swami Sudheendra Thirtha his disciple Samyamindra Thirtha who was anointed after the Mutt declared Raghavendra Thirtha a persona non grata -ascended to the position of head pontiff of the Sri Kashi Mutt Samsthan. “He has not accepted the elevation of Samyamindra Thirtha as pontiff. Legal disputes are pending, and we need more clarification on various aspects including how CBI could proceed with the case,“ said advocate R Lakshmi Narayan.
 
 When the Kerala police failed to nab Raghavendra, the Kerala high court ordered CBI to take over the probe in August 2015.
 
 In 2011 Andhra Pradesh police arrested him in Kadapa and recovered 20 idols.Though Raghavendra was granted bail he violated bail conditions. “We have learnt that he was arrested on Monday by CB-CID as per the   proceedings initiated at Kadapa as well as for alleged misappropriation of funds at the Mutt in Tirupati,“ said P Rangadasa Prabhu, a prominent GSB community member in Kochi.
