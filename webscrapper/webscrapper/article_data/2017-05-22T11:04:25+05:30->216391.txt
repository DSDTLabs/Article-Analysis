TRICHY: It may not be possible for   schools in   to handle the overwhelming number of applications for admissions this year. The number of CBSE schools are far less when compared to matriculation schools in the district.

 Besides this, the faculty ratio is said to be low in these schools and the quality of teachers too has been a matter of concern in many CBSE schools, says educationist.
 
 Out of 34 CBSE schools in Trichy, only 30 schools have classes till higher secondary level, according to official data from the Central Board of Secondary Education.
 
 These numbers are inadequate considering the shift from over 100 matriculation schools on an average. Admissions are more in Class XI as the three language rule is applicable only till Class VIII in CBSE schools.
 
 “While student teacher ratio is found to be at 15:1 on an average in matriculation schools, it is less than 10:1 in many CBSE schools,” said senior faculty from a CBSE school, stating an advantage. 
 
 While the numbers of seats are likely to increase in the secondary level, faculty ratio is likely to dip further. However, academicians say that there is shortage of quality teachers in tier 2 cities. “Since CBSE schools have only emerged in less than a decade, there aren’t many experienced faculty members,” says principal of Vairam matriculation school, G Sasi Priya.
 
 Having been in the interview panel to select teachers for CBSE schools, she said that many teachers lack passion and knowledge. A lot depends on how CBSE syllabus is taught, she said.
