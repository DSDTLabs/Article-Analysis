CHENNAI: Penalty for traffic violations will soon go   as police personnel will be given card swiping machines to enhance the existing handheld e-challan equipment.

 Chief minister Edappadi K   announced in the assembly on Saturday that Rs 6.42 crore had been sanctioned to buy e-challan equipment for traffic police in the city. “We would insist that the supplier include the swiping facility in the equipment. This will certainly help police personnel to use this as dual machine,” said a senior police officer.
 
 Responding to the demand for grants of the home department, Palaniswami appreciated police personnel for their performance in handling several issues in the past year including the public protests and VVIP bandobust during Jayalalithaa’s death.
 
 A police officer said, “We will first distribute the swiping card facility to all traffic police inspectors. Once new equipment is purchased, we will issue the gadgets to all the traffic sub-inspectors manning traffic.” This system will ensure least number of incidents of bribing, as everything is being brought under e-governance, said the officer.
