NEW DELHI:   wrote to chief minister   on Monday, informing him about his decision to resign from his seat. He alleged in his letter that the   had failed to check corruption and neglected   which were the reasons for his decision.

 The MLA said he had joined the party as it had promised to provide a corruption-free model of governance. “AAP had promised to end corruption. But in the past two years, no concrete steps have been taken to implement this poll promise. It appears that the government lacks the will to fulfil its promise,” he wrote.
 
 He pointed out that   had got massive support from the rural areas of Delhi because of its promises. “But we have not fulfilled any promise,” he alleged, giving a list of key promises made during the assembly elections in 2015. 
 
 “The government had promised to do away with Section 81 and Section 33 of Delhi Land Improvement Act. Farmers in Delhi are suffering because of it,” he said.
 
 He said the government had promised to give ownership rights to SC farmers on land given to them for agricultural purpose. 
 
 Another promise, he said in his letter, was to give ownership rights to people who were given plots under the 20-point programme. “The government is yet to implement the land pooling scheme,” he wrote.
 
 On Monday, he resigned from his post at Maharishi Valmiki Hospital. In his letter, he said this was the only big hospital in the assembly constituency. “But there is shortage of staff, lack of facilities for mother and child care. The services are not available 24x7,” he said.
