BHOPAL: Panic prevailed among the residents of   in   area after news about the double murder of the elderly couple spread. The colony is a covered campus, but there are neither security arrangements nor any CCTVs.

 SHO   Manoj Mishra said that the colony has 23 duplex houses and three flats built on the first floor of the complex located on the entrance to the colony facing the road. The boundary walls of the colony are merely five feet high on three sides. On one side, there is just one makeshift boundary wall made up of tin sheets.
 
 
 There are few empty duplexes, including two located on the backside of the house of deceased couple. Police suspect the accused fled through the terrace of these houses after committing the crime.
 
 Deceased couple’s daughter Priyanka Panikar said three years ago a theft of cash and jewellery to the tune of Rs 7 lakh took place in her parent’s house. Her father   along with mother Gomti had gone to Gwalior and their house was locked then. She again raised suspicion of theft on her former domestic help Arti and her husband Raju. “Raju used to work in BHEL under a contractor and used to take whitewash contracts. While I suspected him, my father never suspected him.”
 
 The present domestic help Ashok alias Manoj KK said, “At the time when theft took place at Nair’s house three years ago, there was a security guard in the colony. He used to keep watch during the night and work as caretaker in daytime. After the incident, Nair got him removed from the job. He got grills fitted at his house and never let us employ another security guard. No other incident of crime was reported in the colony thereafter.”
