Ludhiana: Northern railway authorities floated tenders for main parking lots of Ludhiana railway station for the fifth consecutive time after increasing the security bond amount from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 20 lakh to engage private contractors who are serious about running parking lots on a long term basis.

 Sources said, “One of the major reasons for increase in security amount is that earlier, the contractors’ lobby had been trying to force railways to reduce the base price of the tendering amount by first taking the contract and quitting midway, citing losses. They left railway officials in the lurch for the past over 15 months.” 
 
 Sources said in the absence of private authorities to run parking lots, the ticket checking staff was forced to fill in, which led them to neglect checking drives - ecnouraging ticketless travel and unauthorised vendors.
 
 Ajay Kumar, commercial inspector at Ludhiana railway station said, “this time, railways floated tenders after increasing the security bond amount from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 20 lakh because a few private contractors played foul by quitting midway citing financial reasons. Apart from tightening the noose around contractors by adding strict terms and conditions, the railways have reduced rates of main parking lots by 30% so that more contractors can participate in the tender floating process and the railways also get financial benefit.”
 
 Estimated cost of the tender floating process is around Rs 2 crore for only three years (inclusive of all taxes). “Apart from this, everyday cost of parking lots will be around Rs 18,650. Earlier, it was Rs 31,000 per day. The bid will open in the second week of January”, the official said.
