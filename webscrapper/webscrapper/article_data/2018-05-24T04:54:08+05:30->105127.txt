 The PM has done a tremendous job and   too made successful strategies and every ‘karyakarta’ worked very hard.
 
 
 
 There was none. In fact, they got 37 seats, three less. We have got new seats from new areas. The issue here is that we should have got a few more in the   area. 
 
 
 This is a most unholy alliance. It is an alliance of ‘corruption understanding’ where the core is a surrender deal by Congress only with the condition that their misdeeds should not be inquired into and no files should be opened.
 
  
 
 No, I don’t think so. Is there any purpose? Is there any ideology? To hide each other’s corruption cannot be the ideology and that is what they are actually practising. And, therefore, that will never survive. The Prime Minister’s approval rating after four years in office is 60%.
 
 
 The main achievement has been corruption-free good governance. What we mean by good governance is empowering the poor. More than 7.5 crore toilets and 3.65 lakh villages becoming open defecation free is no mean achievement. Over 3.8 crore women who used chulhas now have   connections. There is employment generation across sectors.
 
 
 
 In every sector, employment has increased. We are creating employment in crores.
