AGARTALA: With the state government having banned internet and SMS services to keep a check on communal tension following the murder of journalist   on Wednesday, the continuing clampdown on the telecommunication network is crippling private and public life.

 Media functioning in the state, apart from essential public utilities like banking, online billing and hospital services have been disrupted. State home secretary   said, “Law and order is our priority. Internet services will remain blocked till Sunday midnight.”
 
 Explaining the clampdown, information minister   said, “The administration had to ask telecom companies to block services on September 20 night after widespread violence erupted following the murder of the young television journalist in Mandwai of eastern Agartala to stop the spread of rumours and ethnic tension through social media. Internet can be used as fuel for such high-voltage tension.”
