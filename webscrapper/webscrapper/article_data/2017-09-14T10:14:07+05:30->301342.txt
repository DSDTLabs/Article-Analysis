KANPUR: The   (KDA) will beautify the 6km stretch of land from   up to  . 
 
 The plan is based on the landscaping at New Delhi’s   (IGI) airport and will be presented before the President when he visits the city on Friday. Once approved, KDA will go ahead with the realisation of the project from the first week of November.
  
 The project entails an expenditure of about Rs 15 crore, which the Authority will arrange from its kitty. The detailed project report (DPR) of the project has been readied and KDA vice-chairman K Vijendra Pandiyan will give a presentation of the design before the President during his visit. 
  
 “Drawing inspiration from landscaping at New Delhi’s IGI airport, we would build a similar design at the entrance of Kanpur city. The focus would be on greenery while minimising the construction of structures,” Pandiyan told TOI on Wednesday.
  
 “Its design has already been prepared by landscaping experts and we will present it before the President during his visit to city on September 15. If he gives his nod, we will go ahead with the work as the detailed project report (DPR) too is ready,” he added.
  
 “The work will start in the first week of November and we have set aside a budget of Rs 12-15 crores. The landscaping will add greenery to the place and give it an aesthetic look. All filth, garbage dumps and encroachments will be removed and those entering the city will get to see only greenery,” he said.
  
 He added that the landscaping would be spread in three parts in the 6km stretch from Unnao-Kanpur border to Ramadevi crossing. “The landscaping would run under the flyover at Dhruv Tila location in Jajmau and would continue up to Ramadevi crossing. We want to spread a word about ‘Clean Kanpur, Green Kanpur’ through this project,” he said.
  
 Pandiyan said that the survey for the landscaping had started a month ago and was finished well in time which helped in making of the DPR.
