CHENNAI: Work to start the city’s first underground metro line from Thirumangalam to   appears to be right on schedule, with the 9km stretch is likely to undergo a series of inspections by various authorities for certification in March ahead of its commissioning.

 Officials said they have submitted the papers necessary to the Commissioner of   (CMRS). The inspections are mandatory to get the final go-ahead to open the line to the public. CMRL has planned to open the  , which will have seven stations, by April 2017.
 
 Officials said, with all electrical and signaling systems in place, they have started trial runs on the 9km line. This will help CMRL officials test several aspects including trains’ response to signals, links to control rooms and synchronisation of platform screen doors and train doors.
 
 “This is the first underground line in the city and it is a first experience for us,” an official said. “We will need two months to conduct trial runs ahead of the inspections.”
 
 Trial runs between Thirumangalam and Nehru Park began in October 2016, but officials only put the trains on manual mode at speeds of no more than 25kmph, as against a maximum speed of 80kmph. This was because workers had yet to install signals at stations and tunnels from Shenoy Nagar to Nehru Park.
 
 The underground line, which cuts across the arterial  , will give commuters from neighbouring localities access to a mass transit service. This includes residents of Kilpauk, New Avadi Road, Aminjikarai, Shenoy Nagar and  , who can travel all the way up to the airport with a single ticket.
