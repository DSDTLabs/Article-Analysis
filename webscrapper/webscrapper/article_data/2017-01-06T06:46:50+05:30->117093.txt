MUMBAI: The prepaid counter at the domestic airport shut down on Thursday evening after cabbies went on   over a hike in “convenience charge“ on fares. While airport authorities said the long-overdue increase in convenience charge was just Rs 10 -from Rs 30 to Rs 40 -the taximen refused to budge.

 Airport   leader   said: “The airport authorities charge Rs 20 as service charges. And besides this, it levies a convenience charge which has now been hiked to Rs 40. In the past, the taximen were promised that a part of this money (convenience plus service charge) would be used for the welfare of cabbies, but this has never been done. So, now that they have hiked the convenience charge, we are protesting and demanding that a separate fund be created for welfare of our drivers.“
 
 Sources at the airport said it was justified to hike the convenience charge based on cost escalation over the years.
