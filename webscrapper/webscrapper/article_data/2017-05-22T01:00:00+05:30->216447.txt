It was a nostalgic moment for   actor   when he visited Agra with his co-actor Yukti Kapoor to promote his show  . While it was Yukti’s maiden trip to Agra, Delhi boy Ankit’s been to the city before. Ankit shares, “My first trip with friends and without family was to Agra itself. I was in Class IX.” 
Yukti, who is from Jaipur and finds Agra “relatable”, says, “When we entered Agra I had the same feeling I used to have in Jaipur. Agra and Jaipur are so relatable. Both of them are peaceful, without a concrete jungle of huge buildings as we have in cities like Mumbai and Delhi.”
 Ankit recounts, “When I used to visit this place with friends, we usually used to hang around in the city, eating local dishes like petha and all, and used to shop for shoes, but we rarely went to the Taj. We were fascinated with the monument, but there were so many other things to do in Agra!” 
 Yukti, who has never been to the Taj, regrets not getting an opportunity to visit the monument. She shares, “I have never visited the  . Since childhood, I’ve always dreamed of going to Agra and visiting the Taj. I have seen the Taj in movies and pictures, actors clicking pictures in front of it and foreigners being so fascinated with it. I wanted to get a picture with it, but couldn’t go there this time. I will come back to Agra very soon just to see the Taj.”
