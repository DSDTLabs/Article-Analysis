 Over five months, they designed and prepared working drawings that included mechanical, electrical and plumbing systems, demonstrated performance with simulations, estimated costs and developed financing strategies. They designed a marketable house in Jaipur that is zero energy, zero water, gets WHO-levels of air quality despite ambient pollution — all this at a debt-to-income ratio that bankers found acceptable for their target market. Team ‘Kill Bill’ presented their design to a jury of industry leaders at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the USA. The team was led by  , a first-year M Tech student in Building Energy Performance.
