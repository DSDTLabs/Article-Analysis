Nagpur: On Wednesday, when the Juvenile Justice Board announced its verdict on the only minor involved in the Yug Chandak murder case, the victim’s father stayed away on purpose. Dr Mukesh Chandak said he found it meaningless to be present because the outcome was never going to be in his favour. “I was aware the current law concerning juveniles does not permit appropriate punishment, so why should I go there and be part of it? Though today’s sentencing was not a surprise, it has still left me unsatisfied,” said Dr Chandak.

 His immediate concern was how his better half would react to the news. Dr Chandak said, “I have not told her anything about the verdict and will just wait till she hears or reads the news in media. There was no point in adding to her mental stress.”
 
 He doubted the possibility of the juvenile reforming himself from here on. “There’s no way that two hours of community service will help reform a person. And anyway after that community service he will again go back to the same environment where this conspiracy was hatched. This juvenile was equally guilty as those adults, and he could have stopped the crime at any point of time. His punishment feels more like a child being scolded for doing something wrong, rather than a criminal being made to pay for his actions,” said Dr Chandak.
 
 Speaking in the wider perspective, Dr Chandak said death penalty should never be abolished in India. “What is the deterrence for criminals? It’s death. If you take that away then every criminal will be emboldened, because he knows no matter what he does, his life cannot be taken by the law. Hard-core criminals will misuse this loophole and make our society unsafe,” said Dr Chandak.
