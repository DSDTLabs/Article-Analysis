GURUGRAM: The ground work for the first phase to overhaul Gurgaon’s power gird — called the   project — is likely to start in the next seven to 10 days, officials of discom   said on Thursday. 

 In the first phase, feeder lines that transmit power from substations to homes will go underground. The foot survey for the project has been completed. “Two tenders, covering areas under Maruti and IDC and DLF subdivisions, were awarded in September 2017 to   Ltd at Rs 239.52 crore and Vindhya Telelinks at Rs 255.80 crore. The scheduled date of completion of these works is September 2019,” said Sanjeev Chopra, chief engineer,  . Chopra added the notice inviting tenders for the Kadipur and South City subdivisions are likely to be floated soon. He said the project, once implemented, would help reduce line losses and overhead costs. 
 
 Under the project, DHBVN will adopt advanced grid technologies to improve the existing power distribution system. The project cost has been estimated at Rs1,600 crore approximately and will cover sectors 1 to 57. For the implementation of the project, sectors 1 to 57 have been divided into eight smaller zones comprising areas of 2 subdivisions each. 
 
 Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “The objective of the project is to make Gurgaon a diesel generator-free city. We have to achieve high levels of customer satisfaction with reliable electric supply and pollution control.”
 
 Singh said that in the second phase, the discom will install a supervisory control and data acquisition (Scada) system at the substation level. In the third stage, an advanced metering infrastructure (digital meters) will be installed. In the fourth phase, the low-tension wires outside homes would be strengthened by replacing weaker sections with new material.
