Shraddha is scolding Tina and is about to hit her with a stick when Bihaan enters and stops her.
 
  Shraddha angrily says that she will not accept her mistake and go to boarding school now. Dhruv enters and says that Tina will not go anywhere. Tina stands there crying.
  
  Thapki is thinking of Bihaan when Bani's principal calls her and asks her to come to school.
  
  
 
  
  Dhruv enters his room and sees Shraddha packing her stuff. She tells him that she is going to her parent's house as he did not let Tina go to the boarding school. She then tries to manipulate Dhruv and tells him that it is for Tina's good. He gives up and agrees.
  
  He goes out and tells everyone that Tina will be going to the boarding school. Bihaan gets shocked.
  
  Tina cries and says she won't go anywhere without Bihaan.
  
  Principal, on the other hand, informs Thapki that Bani has beaten the boys again. Thapki apologizes to her.
  
  Tina is made to sit in the car. Shraddha and Sankara feel victorious. Bihaan secretly sits in the car without anyone knowing.
  
  Bani tells Thapki that she wants to meet her father or else she won't talk to her ever. Just then Bihaan and Tina enter the school. Tina sees Bihaan and gets happy. He tells her that he's here to take her back.
