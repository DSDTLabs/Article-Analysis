AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court has said that courts should protect people from police arrest only in exceptional circumstances and only when courts find that they have been falsely involved in a case or when the charges are politically motivated.

 Justice   observed so while refusing pre-arrest bail to a police official accused of demanding a bribe, though the trap against the cop had failed and he was not nabbed accepting the bribe.
 
 The high court said corruption is a serious offence and “anticipatory bail can be granted only in exceptional circumstances where the court is prima facie of the view that the applicant has been falsely roped into the crime or the allegations are politically motivated or are frivolous”.
 
 The case involved  , who was the police station officer at   police station in September 2016, when   lodged a complaint against him for demanding illegal gratification of Rs 4,000. Police laid a trap for Patni, but he did not accept the money at the time. Section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act was applied against him on basis of a telephone conversation recording, in which the cops was heard demanding a bribe.
 
 Patni sought anticipatory bail for the second time, after the voice spectrography test confirmed that the recording was of his voice. Patni’s advocate argued that when the cop did not accept the money, a case of corruption could not have been filed against him at all.
 
 The high court rejected the argument, citing section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act and said that the mere demand or solicitation by a public servant amounts to the commission of an offence.
