NEW DELHI: The ruling BJP’s income soared 81% to Rs 1,034 crore in 2016-17 from Rs 570 crore in 2015-16, according to updated 
  . 

 As per BJP’s annual audit report submitted on Febuary 8, its total receipts for 2016-17 matched the receipts (Rs 1,033 crore) of all seven national parties, including BJP, put together in 2015-16. BJP’s income constituted roughly two-thirds of the combined income of Rs 1,559 crore for all national parties in 2016-17. So, BJP alone earned double of the other six national parties (Congress, BSP, Trinamool, CPM, CPI and NCP) put together in 2016-17. 
 
  
  
 
 This is much higher than the Congress share during the tenure of UPA between 2004-05 and 2013-14. The Congress share touched a high of 58% in the first year of UPA-I. By the last year of UPA-II, 2013-14, it was down to 39%, below BJP’s share of 44% for the same year. 
 
 
  
  
 
 Of BJP’s income, Rs 997 crore came from voluntary contributions. Of this, Rs 533 crore was received in contributions exceeding Rs 20,000 each. BJP’s total expenditure was Rs 710 crore, leaving it with unspent income of Rs 324 crore, almost Rs 100 crore more than Congress’s income of Rs 225 crore in 2016-17. 
 
 For Congress, this represented a fall from Rs 261 crore declared in 2015-16. A good chunk of Congress' income, according to an analysis by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), came from issuance of coupons (Rs 115.6 crore). The party’s expenditure exceeded its income by almost Rs 96 crore, as per the annual audit report filed by the party on March 19, 2018. 
 
  
  
 Of the national parties, only BSP, CPM and TMC filed their annual audit reports within the October 30, 2017 deadline. Congress was late by 138 days and BJP by 99 days.
 
 BSP received Rs 173.6 crore in 2016-17, a jump from Rs 47.4 crore the preceding year. Interestingly, going by the contribution report filed by BSP, none of the contributions was in excess of Rs 20,000. 
 
 CPM’s receipts of about Rs 100 crore were marginally lower than the Rs 107 crore it had declared the preceding year, but enough to put it in fourth place. 
 
 Interestingly, Trinamool Congress declared income of a mere Rs 6.3 crore, a fraction of the Rs 34.5 crore shown in 2015-16. Like Congress, Trinamool’s Rs 24 crore expenditure was higher than its income. 
 
 CPI declared an income of Rs 2.1 crore in 2016-17, down from Rs 10.2 crore in 2015-16, while NCP’s income grew to Rs 17.2 crore from Rs 9.1 crore. 
 
 Voluntary contributions were the largest source of declared income for the seven national parties, accounting for Rs 1,169 crore or about 75% of the total income. The total expenditure shown by the seven parties was about Rs 1,228 crore. 
 
 A look at contribution reports filed by the national parties, recording donations in excess of Rs 20,000, reveals while BJP received nearly Rs 533 crore as contributions from identified sources, such contributions to CPM totalled Rs 5.2 crore, to NCP Rs 6.3 crore, to Trinamool Rs 2.2 crore and CPI Rs 1.4 crore. Details of donations of above Rs 20,000 each to Congress had not been uploaded by the EC.
