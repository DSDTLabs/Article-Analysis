BENGALURU: Special   court judge Rajeshwari N Hegde convicted a shoe shop assistant for touching a four-year-old girl inappropriately, and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment.

 The court also slapped a fine of Rs 2,000 on the convict on Monday.
 
 SR Raghavendra, 26, a resident of HSR Layout and employee of a shoe mart in the same area, was arrested in 2014 on Pocso charges after the girl’s parents filed a complaint, accusing him of improperly touching her on the pretext of adjusting a new shoe.
 
 During the trial, special public prosecutor SN Hiremani pleaded for imposing maximum punishment.
 
 The parents had taken the girl to the shoe mart and were busy looking at different brands of shoes, when the accused took advantage of the situation and improperly touched the girl, police said. The girl raised an alarm and her mother, on hearing her screams, rushed to her help and caught Raghavendra red-handed.
