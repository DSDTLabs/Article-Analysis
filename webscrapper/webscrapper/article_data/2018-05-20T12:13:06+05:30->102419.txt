AGRA: Dalit intellectuals have termed the state government's order to replace Dr  's statue with that of Bharatiya Jana Sangh leader   a "deliberate attempt to provoke the Dalit community". Speaking to TOI, political commentator Chandra Bhan Prasad said, "It's a calculated move in view of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, as the   wants to place general masses against the 20% Dalit vote bank. The saffron party has gradually been portraying an anti-Dalit image of itself to gain advantage in elections. They have now shifted from 'Muslim versus rest' to 'Dalit versus rest' model." 

 He said, "This deliberate act to install Deendayal Upadhyay's statue by replacing one of Ambedkar is to magnify the tension and separate Dalits from general masses and OBCs. Earlier incidents of vandalising Ambedkar statues were just preparation of the turf for their future course of politics. BJP has no agenda for the upcoming election. They have failed in economic growth, job opportunities and other issues, and they need to divert public attention." 
 
 Vivek Kumar, professor of sociology at JNU, said, "BJP wants Dalits to waste their time and energy in such deliberate acts of provocation, so that the community gets agitated and holds protest, which would portray a negative image of Dalits." "Dalit movement and its political leadership is weak at present. And such provocation will get focus by community and this is exactly what the BJP wants, to entangle the Dalit leaders and community," he said.  , member of Ambedkar Mahasabha, said, "It's a manufactured cover-up of BJP to divert public attention and create rift between Dalits and others. People have to understand the politics behind this deliberate act."
 
 Talking to TOI, BJP's Agra MP and   chairman   said that he was not aware of any order for replacing Bhim Rao Ambedkar statue with that of Pt  's. He said, "Instead of replacing it, Pt Deendayal's statue can be installed at any place inside the AMC premises."
