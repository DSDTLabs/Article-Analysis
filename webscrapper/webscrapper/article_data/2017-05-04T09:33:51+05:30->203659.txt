NEW DELHI: India and the US are working on three sets of dates in June and July for PM Modi’s possible state visit. Modi has engagements in Germany, Spain, Russia and Kazakhstan that will end by June 9. It will be Modi’s first visit to the US after   assumed presidency.
 
  Issues likely to figure during a Modi-Trump dialogue include H-1B visa, Af-Pak, west and east Asian situation, stability of Asia-Pacific region and challenges from  . Changes in   rules have seen Indian software giants scouting for other markets.
  
  Cross-border terror and expansion of defence ties also will figure prominently in the dialogue, as it did during McMaster’s trip. The current Pak actions along LoC and attempts to export terror are likely to be on Modi’s agenda.
  
  PM begins his foreign engagements with a visit to Sri Lanka next week, followed by a trip to Germany (May 30) for inter-governmental consultations, bilateral trip to Spain (May 31) and Russia (June 1-3) for the St Petersburg International Economic Forum & Annual Summit.
  
  Between June 7 and 9, Modi will be in Astana for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Summit, when India will be admitted as a member. TheUS formally invited Modi for a US visit when national security advisor   visited India last month.
  
  Trump also had twice invited Modi to visit the US this year, during his telephonic conversations with him. This will be Modi’s fifth trip to the US since he became PM. He was in the US twice last year, including a standalone bilateral engagement that featured an address to the joint session of Congress.
