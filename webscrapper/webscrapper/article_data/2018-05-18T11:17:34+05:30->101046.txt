HYDERABAD: Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has asked the   ( ) to probe an alleged scam in which some medical seats were made availed in the past under sports quota using fake credentials.

 “The government has been informed that some people have been misusing the sports quota to get   seats. The CM has ordered a comprehensive inquiry into it. He has said action will be taken against the culprits,” an official release from the   said on Thursday. No further details were given by the CMO about when this scam had occurred.
 
 In a similar case in 2016, the Hyderabad High Court, found fault with officials of the   and the Sports Authority of AP and had stayed MBBS admissions under the sports quota for the year.
 
 The court had criticised the whimsical manner in which authorities sought to reserve MBBS seats under the sports quota without any constitutional sanction. Scores of petitions were filed by students seeking MBBS seats, citing their achievements in various games like softball and fencing. The AP government earlier that year wanted to include six little-known new games such as tennikoit, powerlifting, netball, throwball, se pak takraw (kick volleyball) and boxing in the sports quota.
 
 After news of the probe ordered broke on Thursday, doctors’ associations said the government should ensure that such scams do not happen in future. “Thorough verification of candidates under medical common entrance test and national eligibility-cum-entrance test must be conducted seeking admission under sports quota,” said Dr G Srinivas, advisor to Telangana Junior Doctors’ Association.
