 biggie   was in town for the very first time this Saturday, and the city gig marked the first also for the French DJ’s   that has been hit by a slew of cancellations and a lot of confusion. Ahead of his Saturday concert, Hyderabad Times caught up with up with the man for a quick chat.

 
 
 Hyderabad, it’s been a long time coming! And I’m excited to see the city and get to know the people. Indians bring so much energy to the shows, it’s crazy. I’m expecting nothing less in Hyderabad as well. 
 As to what Hyderabad can expect from me, I always add something new to every show. Since I’ve been releasing new music, I’m going to be giving Hyderabad a glimpse into a new track. I think Hyderabad will love it!
 
 
 Yes, it’s true that there are so many amazing artistes, and new talent popping up on a daily basis. It’s a crazy scene and so it never gets boring! I believe that there is a lot to be learnt from new and emerging artistes. Sometimes there are styles and sounds that can be very inspiring and can actually get your creative juices flowing. So I draw inspiration from these new sounds and forms, to keep evolving and stay relevant.
 
 
 Indian music is definitely interesting. The history and culture behind each of these forms are so inspiring. And the best part is that the young are not only exposed to all these forms but are open to the newer genres. And I absolutely love how dedicated Indian listeners are when it comes to music that they love. 
 Honestly though, I don’t have any favourite artistes, Indian or otherwise. But I’m really surprised by the amazing things I’m hearing about Indian DJs lately. I really haven’t intently followed one particular Indian artiste. But it’s never late to start, right? May be I will get to meet some on this tour.
