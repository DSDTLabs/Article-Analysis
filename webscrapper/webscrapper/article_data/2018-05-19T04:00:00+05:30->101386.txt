Gandhinagar: Amid the high-voltage power struggle in Karnataka, the political environment in Gujarat is set to get stormier in June, as the state development commissioner has issued a notification announcing the end of the 2.5 year terms of presidents of district and taluka panchayats, according to the Gujarat Panchayat Act 1993 (amendment 2015 and rules 2017) and the holding of elections of new presidents with a new SC, ST and SEBC reservations roster. After the 2015 panchayat polls, this is the first time an amendment will be implemented. The Congress controls 24 of the 33 district panchayats in the state, the BJP has the rest. The Congress fears this is another attempt by the BJP to snatch power in many of these district and taluka panchayats. The development commissioner has announced scheduled caste reservations in two districts, seven for schedule tribes and three for SEBCs (socially and economically backward classes). The commissioner also announced reservation for women on 50% of the seats. Manoj Agrawal, the development commissioner, said, “This notification has been made according to the Panchayats Act, the amendment of 2015 and the 2017 rules, announcing the end of the 2.5 year terms of the current presidents of district and taluka panchayats. District collectors will conduct elections in all district and taluka panchayats according to the SC, ST and SEBC and women’s reservations, before June 22.” Congress spokesman Manish Doshi said, “The BJP has tried to snatch power ever since Congress won most of the district and taluka panchayats. The BJP could try to destabilize our elected bodies in these elections for presidents, but we are taking ample precautions and will not allow the BJP to pull off shenanigans like in Karnataka in Gujarat.”
