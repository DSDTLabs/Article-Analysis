NEW DELHI:   were   while   to cross   in   on Tuesday. In both the cases, the victims died on the spot, officials said.

 
  In the first case, a woman was killed at 5.30am near the Palam railway station while she was trying to   the tracks when a train 12458, headed to Sarai Rohilla, hit her. Both RPF and GRP officials rushed to the spot, however, officials said the impact was so strong that she died within minutes.
 
  In the second case, three people were caught similarly in the grasp of a train near the Ashram flyover. Confirming the incident, DCP (railways) Parvez Ahmed said the incident was reported to them at 6:30pm. One of the deceased has been identified as Shankar (30), a resident of Tughlaqabad in southeast Delhi. He worked as a private security guard.
 
  The other two victims are yet to be identified and police have launched an inquest under Section 174 of the CrPC.
 
  A preliminary probe suggested that the accident happened due to jaywalking on the tracks. The three men were walking towards Kotla when they were hit from behind, officials said.
 
 Railway officials said in both the incidents, the areas had JJ clusters nearby with locals often crossing the tracks to cross to the other side. “It is difficult to stop people from crossing these tracks and even fines and other penalties do not deter them. While foot-over-bridges have been provided, they are at the railway station and people don’t tend to use them,” said an official.
 
  On an average, nearly 100 deaths are reported annually on the tracks with a majority of them being jaywalkers. In nearly half the cases, victims are often found to be using mobile phones or using earphones.
