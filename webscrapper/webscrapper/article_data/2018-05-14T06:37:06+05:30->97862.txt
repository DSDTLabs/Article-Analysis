BENGALURU: The right of a wife to receive   does not confer the right to include her name as a nominee in the service register of her husband. The high court made this observation while dealing with a civil revision petition filed by Adamsaheb, an employee of the education department.

 
 “The contention of the respondent-wife that her right to receive family pension under the   (family pension) Rules includes the right to have her name entered as a nominee in the service register is misconceived,” Justice Krishna S Dixit observed.
 
 Turning down the request of Razia Begum, wife of Adamsaheb, the court noted that the nomination only eases the task of an employer in identifying the widow/widower or children who are entitled to family pension.
 
 The court said family pension, which is granted to a widow or widower when a government employee dies in harness, does not depend on who is made the nominee in the service register of that particular employee.
 
 It dismissed Razia’s sui twhich was pending before the Belagavi family court,stating that she had no litigable interest in the matter. However, the court noted that Razia still can make a representation to the government for redressal of her grievances.
 
 Adamsaheb had challenged the family court’s July 15,2017 order, rejecting his application seeking dismissal of Razia’s suit. In the suit filed in 2016, Razia had sought for a direction to include her name as a nominee in the government service records of her husband.
