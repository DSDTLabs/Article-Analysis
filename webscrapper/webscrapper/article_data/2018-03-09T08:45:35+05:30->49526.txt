 “The whole idea is to have business incubators with a purpose and the aim is to incubate 50 social entrepreneurs by 2020,” said Param Singh, MD and founder of Uday.
 
 Param said these social entrepreneurs can be school students or college students or anyone from rural areas of Punjab or just anyone from the crowd who has an idea that can impact lives in Punjab and bring about a positive change. He said he did find a couple of such entrepreneurs at the TiECON and will get in touch with them.
 
 The entrepreneurs will not only be funded, but will be properly guided and exposed to various pitching events in India and abroad. They plan to get four to five such startups by the end of the year so that they can take them abroad in February or March to expose them to various profit-with-a-purpose models.
