THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: As sisters,   and   had always walked hand in hand, a trait that saw them move out of their home in   to   and eventually brought them together here. On Sunday, a day after she saw and identified her sister's body, Ilze was seen trying to walk in Liga's shoes. In a bid to find out how Liga could have ended up at among the thickets at   from  , where she was last seen alive, Ilze tried to emulate the trip by covering the entire distance between the two spots on foot, starting from Kovalam. 

 She reached Kovalam around 8.30am and started walking towards Panathura. Her attempt was to find out whether it was possible to reach the spot that was located 3km to the north on foot that too without being noticed by locals. Giving her company was the social activists, who had been aiding her in her search for Liga. 
 
 "We found out that it is possible to reach the spot on foot. Even though the spot was separated from the beach by a waterbody in between, we could reach there when we took a slight deviation at a certain point to cover a few distance," Ilze said. It took over an hour to cover the entire distance. But that was because they were walking slowly and stopping to talk to people hoping to find some clue, Ilze said. 
 
 Ilze still firmly believes that Liga would not have found the secluded spot alone and someone might have accompanied there. She could have met somebody on the way that took her to the spot and harmed her. She believed this because Liga was wearing someone else's jacket when found. 
 
 "It was I who packed her bag before taking the flight and I don't remember keeping such a jacket among her clothes. Also, I don't think the jacket was of any brands available in Europe, which Liga normally wore," she said. Ilze added that she would be meeting the chief minister on Monday and address the media later. She intends to stay here till she receives the autopsy report.
