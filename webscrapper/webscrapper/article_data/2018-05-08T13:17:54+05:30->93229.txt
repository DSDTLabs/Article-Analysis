TIRUPUR: Women members of a social outfit on Monday petitioned the   district administration seeking action against the rural police, especially   police, for refusing to provide permission to them to hold demonstrations and public meetings.

 S   of   said, “We planned to organize agitations against the increase of bus fare hike in two places in Kangeyam on January 29. And we sought permission from the Kangeyam police. But permission was denied citing that women were about to take part in the protests along with infants.”
 
 “This was not the first time. Police have denied permission for us many a times. When we sought permission to celebrate bicentenary of Karl Marx’s birth on May 5, it was also denied on the same ground,” she said.
 
 “It is up to the parents to decide whether they want their children to participate in protests and meeting or not,” she said. 
 
 “By denying us permission, the police are forcing women and children to stay out of political issues and encouraging gender inequality. When questioned, the police say that they took the decisions for the safety of women and children. It was completely arbitrary,” Gayathiri added.
 
 Superintendent of police E S   told TOI: “The police should also consider the safety aspect of the children. Moreover, such decisions could be taken by the local police inspector based on the needs. If any untoward incident happens, the police would be held responsible for it.”
