BHUBANESWAR: An assembly panel led by Speaker   on Friday decided to seek appointment of Prime Minister   once again demanding hike in the   (MSP) of paddy.

 Though the assembly secretariat had earlier sought appointment of the Prime Minister over the issue in April, the latter's office had reportedly communicated the assembly secretariat to meet Union agriculture minister   on the issue, official sources said.
 
 "So far, we have not received any formal communication from the Prime Minister's Office to submit memorandum over MSP. Officials in the assembly secretariat told that they had a telephonic conversation with the PMO, which advised them to meet some other Union ministers over the issue. We sought the Prime Minister's appointment on the basis of a unanimous resolution in the assembly but it is unfortunate that we did not get the appointment," said leader of opposition Narasingha Mishra.
 
 He said the assembly panel decided to once again seek appointment of the Prime Minister by June-end. 
 
 Former food supplies minister and member of the assembly panel Sanjay Das Burma also criticized the Prime Minister for not giving appointment to the panel. The assembly panel was constituted to meet the Prime Minister over MSP. So, what is the point in meeting other Union ministers, Das Burma said.
 
 On March 25, the assembly had passed a resolution urging the Centre to hike in the MSP to Rs 2,930 per quintal. Currently, the Centre has set the MSP at Rs 1,470 per quintal for common variety (widely produced) and Rs 1,510 for high quality paddy. Farmer leaders, however, alleged that farmers are not getting the MSP price properly due to mismanagement in the paddy procurement system. Farmers are forced to sell paddy to middleman much below the MSP, said farmer leader and BJP MLA Pradeep Purohit.
