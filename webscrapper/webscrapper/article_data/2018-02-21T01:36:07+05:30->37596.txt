NEW DELHI: On a plea seeking a complete ban on   of   allegedly by   ( )  , the Delhi high court on Tuesday issued bailable warrants against those students who failed to appear before the court despite repeated summons. 

 The petitioner in the case, advocate Prashant Manchanda, said that previously Acting Chief Justice Gita and Justice C Hari Shankar had taken a serious note of the absence of 22 participating candidates allegedly involved in defacement of public properties, who failed to make any contribution towards the cleaning drive.
 
 As a result, he said, the HC issued a showcause notice asking why punitive actions may not be taken against them for failing to participate in the cleanliness drive directed to be carried out by them. 
 
 The court also directed the petitioner, DMRC and the DU to prepare formal guidelines with a view to prevent future defacement of public properties during DUSU elections.
 
 On Tuesday, the court noted that as the student candidates had failed to participate in cleaning the defacement and also abstained from appearing in the court proceedings despite repeated directions, they would have to pay a fine of Rs 5,000 to be collected by the SHO of Maurice Nagar police station.
 
 In addition, the HC also stated that the entire city has been defaced — even churches and other religious institutions were not spared — yet the matter was trivialised by the participating candidates. 
 
 The court also expressed concern over the properties permanently damaged by spray paints stating that the DUSU president, along with some candidates — who were present in the court — must take concrete steps to beautify the defaced properties preserving their aesthetic value after obtaining permission from the DMRC.
