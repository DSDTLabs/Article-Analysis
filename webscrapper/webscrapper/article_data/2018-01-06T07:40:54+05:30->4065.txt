AHMEDABAD: Call it a   or   taken after   raised  ,   have decided to hold   in areas which accommodate weaker sections of the society, specially dalits and minorities. 

 The decision came after some dalit organizations met Ahmedabad police chief A K Singh to express their anguish over Bhima Koregaon incident by organizing protest programmes.
 
 “After a fruitful discussion with the dalit groups, a consensus was reached and it was decided that the organizations, for now, will not give any call for disruptive programmes like bandh or chakka jam,” said Singh.
 
 “Though the decision of not giving such calls is temporary, we are in negotiation with dalit groups to avoid such calls as the Bhima Koregaon incident is not a local one. I am of the opinion that we should not turn a blind eye to such incidents and protest in legitimate and legal manner,” added Singh.
 
 Singh said that even in a meeting with additional secretary (home), M S Dagur, they had agreed to keep the social welfare department in the loop. “ACS said the police should act as an extended arm of the administration and participate in developmental agenda and work in areas which witness apathy of administration,” Singh said.
 
 Meetings with dalit groups were held in almost all police station areas on Thursday evening simultaneously. “Some meetings were also held in mohallas and on streets to get a real feel of issues faced by the weaker sections of the society,” Singh added.
