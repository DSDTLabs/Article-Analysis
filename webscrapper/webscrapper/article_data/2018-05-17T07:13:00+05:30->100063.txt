Ludhiana: During the first Punjab Agri and Food Conclave organized at Pal Auditorium in Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) on Wednesday, public and private sector enterprises from various food processing industries exhibited their products. State industry minister Sundar Sham Arora visited all the stalls, and appreciated the products manufactured by the industries.

 One of the major highlights of the exhibition was a stall put up by Ludhiana-based White Gold Agro Industries, which has set up the first ever dry fruit processing plant in Punjab six months ago, and is currently processing raw and organic cashew into an edible form. The company — owned by young entrepreneur Vinod Jain — has its 45,000 square feet plant at Industrial Area A, and its present production is one tonne per day.
 
 Giving more information, Jain said: “We have set up a state-of-the-art processing and packaging plant for dry fruits in Ludhiana. We are importing organic cashew from West Africa and East Africa, and processing this into various grades. Presently, our production is one tonne per day. The price range of our cashews is from Rs 850 to Rs 1,200 per kg.”
 
 He added: “We are getting tremendous response, as demand for our products is exceeding production. We are aiming at increasing our production by five times towards the year-end, and export our products to Europe and Middle East, along with adding new products like roasted and flavoured  . The industry minister and other dignitaries appreciated our project, and have assured us that the government would extend every help required by us for the expansion of our business.”
