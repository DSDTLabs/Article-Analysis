PATNA: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar’s JD (U) may join the fray in the upcoming Punjab assembly elections.

 JD (U) sources said Nitish is likely to convene a meeting next week to discuss the issue and take a final call in this regard. “Our party president is keeping a close eye on the political developments, but has not taken a final call yet. We expect a meeting around January 8 and the final decision will be taken then,” a party source said. 
 
 JD (U) secretary general KC Tyagi said most political parties in Punjab were in touch with Nitish for the coming assembly election. “Members of   and   led by   have approached Nitish JI to contest election. Though Nitish JI has not taken a final call yet. Our party will very soon take a decision on Punjab election,” he said.
 
 Another senior JD (U) functionary said the party has Congress as its ally in Bihar and Nitish JI has personal relation within his Punjab counterpart   for over three decades. 
 
 “Successful organization of   and huge response from Sikh community has given JD (U) the reason to jump into the electoral fray. The Sikhs who have come from all over the world, especially from Punjab, would be the brand ambassadors for JD (U) and   if the party contests Punjab election. We would definitely like to use it as an opportunity to increase our footprint in the country,” said the JD (U) functionary. 
 
 Huge presence of Bihari migrants in Punjab, especially around Amritsar, Ludhiana and Chandigarh, is also an attraction for the JD (U). “We expect people from Bihar along with the Sikhs who have visited Patna during Prakashotsava, will be our major vote bank,” he said.
