Vadodara: A bootlegger, who was arrested by Karelibaug police on Friday evening after he was released from Vadodara Central Jail, managed to flee from the police station early on Saturday morning.

 The accused Hussain Sunni earlier on September 5 was arrested by detection of crime branch (DCB) in connection with a prohibition case. Sunni was then sent to jail. On Friday when he was released from jail on bail, Karelibaug police arrested him in connection with another prohibition case.
 
 At the police station, when Sunniâ€™s health deteriorated he was taken to a private hospital near the police station for treatment. Late in the night, Sunni was brought back to police station and was kept in a room on the ground floor of the police station.
 
 Police sources said that four constables were keeping an eye on Sunni throughout the night. On Saturday early morning two constables went out for tea and the other two waited at the police station after locking the room where Sunni was kept. According to sources, when the two constables, who were waiting outside the room, dozed off Sunni escaped from a ventilator in the room.
 
 Police found a CCTV camera footage in which Sunni is seen escaping. When it was learnt that Sunni has fled, cops searched at his hideouts but he was not found.
 
 Since Karelibaug police station is situated under the jurisdiction of city police station, cops started the process of registering an FIR against the four constables there. But, until late night the complaint was not registered.
