THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Kottarakkara police probing the alleged   faced by a 12-year- student of Mar Ivanios Bethany School, Kalayapuram, recorded the statement of the school   on Saturday. The principal, Rev Father  , reportedly told the police that he resorted to the measure in a bid to maintain discipline inside the classroom as the children went beyond limits in their antics. 

 The police on Friday had booked the principal for severely caning a class VII boy, after receiving complaint from his parents. The boy, who suffered injuries on his back, had to seek treatment at Kottarakkara taluk hospital. According to the complaint, the principal had taken four boys, including the complainant, to the former’s office room and caned them. Meanwhile, the police officials said that even though the principal have admitted to have committing the crime, they were unlikely to arrest him. This was because the alleged offence were not of ‘serious’ nature.
 
 “We normally arrest a person if the offence committed warrants a punishment of a sentence more than seven years or if there is a chance where the accused person may abscond, affecting the probe and trial,’’ said P S Jose Prakash, sub-inspector, Kottarakkara.
 
 Father John Palavila has been booked under section 324 of IPC (causing hurt using dangerous weapons) and other relevant sections of Juvenile Justice Act.
 
 Meanwhile, student organisations are planning to organise protest in front of the school on Monday demanding the arrest of principal. tnn
