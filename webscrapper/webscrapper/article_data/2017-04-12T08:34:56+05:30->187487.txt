RANCHI: Only 58% of the students enrolled in government-run primary (I-V) and middle (VI-VII) schools avail themselves of   (MDM) in the state. 

 According to government data, only 40% students from Class I to VIII in Giridih and Deoghar take midday meals. The situation is better in Ranchi district where 78% students have lunch. At 99%, Lohardaga and East Singhbhum districts have the best records.
 
 Aradhana Patnaik, secretary department of school, education and literacy, said, "There is an attendance problem among students in schools. In such cases, when we take into consideration an average number of students, the total percentage of students getting MDM becomes quite low."
 
 If students are irregular in schools for three days, state-run scheme Prayas and child cabinet and school management committee (SMC) members visit their homes and enquire about their well-being. "We try to motivate parents to send their children to school," Patnaik added. 
 
 "In Giridih, non-availability of rice often hits the MDM," she said.
 
 In the first week of this month,   (DCs) and   (DEOs) were asked to regularise MDM by June 30. "We have warned them of stringent action if they failed to do so," Patnaik said.
