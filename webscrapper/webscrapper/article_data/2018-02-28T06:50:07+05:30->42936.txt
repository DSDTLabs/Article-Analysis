HYDERABAD: The Delhi chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) has recommended   methods for cleaning up the historic   and the four natural streams feeding it.

 Responding to a story in 
  on the high pollution levels in all the four streams of the Hussainsagar, INTACH has suggested replicating the bioremediation experiment conducted on the   in Uttar Pradesh to cleanse Hussainsagar of harmful contaminants. Bioremediation is the process of removal of pollutants from water with the help of biological products like bacteria.
 
 The quality of water in Assi Nadi has now improved tremendously and the method, if replicated, would help Hussainsagar and its inlet channels get rid of pollution, said INTACH Hyderabad convener P  , adding that the Assi Nadi experiment used bacteria concentrates, which degrade organic pollutants, enhance dissolved oxygen levels and remove odours.
 
 “In the case of Assi Nadi, the retention time of polluted water was increased by installing soil bag weirs at different locations, creating a lagoon on the upstream side and allowing for settling action as well as greater retention period on the otherwise fast flowing stream,” she said, adding that the overall cost of cleansing Hussainsagar and its inlet and outlet channels would come down considerably through bioremediation methods.
 
 Besides bacteria, installation of coconut coir log bundles would also help improve the quality of water. Coconut coir serves as a medium for bacteria to reside, grow and treat pollutants. It also serves as a filtering medium and reduces the velocity of water flow.
 
 Group Captain Rahul Pathak (Rtd),   chapter, said the floating waste in Hussainsagar and nalas should be manually removed before taking up bioremediation.“Bioremediation will be beneficial till all the sewage lines are connected to STPs. The water quality will improve, enhancing the aesthetic appearance of Hyderabad’s water bodies,” he explained.
