Ever since the song Suya..Suya from Winner was released a few days back, online trolls have hit out at   who danced in the song. 

 The trolls suggested that Anasuya was wrong to do an 'item song' in 'skimpy outfits' in front of a Lord Buddha statue in the pub that it was shot at. Not one to back down, Anasuya retorted saying that the song was shot inside the famous Buddha Bar in   and that it was normal for people consume liqour in that bar. 
 
 Anasuya gave the trolls a taste of their own medicine by saying that those who don't treat others with respect have no right to talk about God.
