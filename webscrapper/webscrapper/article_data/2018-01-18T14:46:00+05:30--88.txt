Bhagalpur: Chief minister   inaugurated 112 projects worth Rs 112.8 crore and laid stones of 512 projects worth Rs 137.16 crore during his ‘Vikas Sameeksha Yatra’ at   village in   block of Bhagalpur district on Wednesday. 

 This was the CM’s second visit to the village. He was here during his ‘Vikas Yatra’ in February 2009 as well.
 
 Nitish, who reached the village nearly two hours behind the schedule due to inclement weather, went straight to meet the family of IAF commando   who was martyred fighting terrorists in J&K on October 12 last year. 
 
 After assuring all help to the martyr’s family, the CM went to inaugurate the newly built panchayat bhawan, e-kisan bhawan and statistics-cum-engineering bhawan. He also inaugurated a Martyr   to commemorate the sacrifice made by the local youth for the nation.
 
 Speaking at public meeting later in the village, the CM reiterated that his ‘Saat Nischay’ (seven resolves) initiative was aimed at making the youth self-reliant through education and skill development. As part of the initiative, the state government was also providing electricity connection to all villages and piped water supply to every household besides road and drainage in urban areas.
 
 Asserting that prohibition has led to the fall in crime rate and curb on domestic violence, the CM said, “We are going to implement the prohibition laws more strictly.” 
 
 He called upon the people to inform police about liquor law offenders. “The identity of informers will be kept a secret,” he said.
 
 Describing dowry and child marriage as the two other social evils hampering the progress of families and society, the CM urged the gathering to be part of the human chain to be formed against these social evils on January 21.
