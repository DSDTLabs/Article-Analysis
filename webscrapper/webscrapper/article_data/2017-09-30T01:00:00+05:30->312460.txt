Apart from   that are held during the entire day for all these four days, we have organized various competitions like shankh naad competition, musical chair, lemon and spoon race among others. For the first time in Agra, we are also staging plays at our pandal. Plays like Miser and Bada Babu were staged on Thursday."

 Mrinalini Ghosh, a visitor to the Balkeshwar Durga Puja Pandal, says, "Though I didn’t win, it was fun to participate in the shankh naad competition. Apart from worshipping Goddess Durga, the other events that are being organized here garner great appreciation from the crowd. The ‘Mahishasur Mardini’ Durga idol this year is made by artisans from Kolkata.'
