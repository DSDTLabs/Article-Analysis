Nagpur: The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has booked a junior   of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) and his accomplice for demanding bribe for providing building permission.

 An ACB official said the complainantâ€™s relatives own two plots at Dhote Layout, Ajni. The relatives had given power of attorney to him to construct a building on these plots. The complainant, who name has not been revealed, went to Laxmi Nagar zone of NMC and met junior engineer Ramchandra Hatwar of public works department to get the building permission.
 
 Hatwar told him to pay Rs10,000 as bribe for each building permission. Since the complainant did not want to pay the bribe, he lodged a   with ACB on May 12. The ACB laid a trap for Hatwar on May 15. Hatwar, who had initially demanded Rs20,000 settled for Rs16,000 and accepted the money through his driver Sanjay Shende. As soon as Shende took the money, ACB sleuths nabbed him.
 
 ACB has registered a case under Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, against Hatwar and Shende at Bajaj Nagar   station.
 
 The operation was carried out under the guidance of superintendent of police (ACB) Sanjay Darade by a team led by police inspectors Monali Chaudhari and Bhavna Dhumale.
