Pune: Pune-based Film and Television Institute of India on Wednesday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Canon to promote short-term courses in film and television technology. Canon will support the skill-oriented courses as technology partner.

 The courses are proposed to be held in non-metros such as Guwahati, Jaipur, Vishakhapatnam, Raipur, Chandigarh, Raipur, Bhopal, Leh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands to begin with. Initially, under FTII's initiative, Skilling India in Film and Television (SKIFT) would conduct courses such as digital cinematography, documentary filmmaking, screenplay writing, acting, film criticism and journalism and film appreciation, a statement issued by the Press Information Bureau said.
 
 The short-term courses, mostly of skill-oriented nature, have been proposed to be held in collaboration with state governments, universities and educational institutions.
 
 Canon, as 'technology partner' of SKIFT would provide high-end cameras and accessories free of cost for the courses. This support would be a major contributing factor in keeping the course fees affordable while offering an opportunity to course participants to use cutting-edge equipment, the statement said.
