Bengaluru-based filmmaker Amogh Shambu’s short   Snehada Jeevigaalu was screened in San Francisco recently. The film revolves around the theme of friendship and has students from Adarsha Film Institute acting in it. “I’m very excited. Though, I was in Bengaluru when the   was screened, I got to know that it received mixed reviews. It’s such a proud moment for me,” says Amogh, adding that it’s a proud moment that a   short film was screened at the Roxie Theatre.

 Amogh is currently assisting Ganesh Srinivasan for his upcoming film Action Hero Santu, starring Santosh. “The film is about an Indian Army officer. It’s a love story but also has elements of horror in it,” says Amogh. In addition to this, he is also said to be working with the team of a talk show that will have celebrities interacting with the host.
