CHENNAI: Space at a premium because of rapid urbanisation? No matter.   in Chennai are shooting for the sky — and providing an increasingly polluted city with additional green cover.

 The forest department has taken the lead by helping to popularise the concept: It has set up a model vertical garden on the IFS officers mess campus in Velachery.
 
 The man behind the effort — horticulturist S   — told TOI that even a portico can provide adequate space to set up a vertical garden, adding that all it required was a minimum space of three metres in length and two metres in height.
 
 The garden on the forest department premises is spread over 300sqft and contains 1,000 plants of no less than 10 species, which grow out of several small fibre containers.
 
 Around 300 plants can be arranged on the wall in a 100sqft area, Udhayakumar said, adding that it would cost ?2,000/sqft, inclusive of labour, frames, containers, stand and clamps.
 
 He said his team sets up a vertical garden in a week and maintains it for the first three months, following which the house owner would have to continue the upkeep. Effective maintenance, including trimming, spraying and replacing damaged plants, would extend the garden’s life to five years.
 
 The plants on display on the forest premises are of teh type that offer partial shade. Flowering, medicinal and bonsai plants may also used in vertical gardens, Udhayakumar said.
 
 The concept began to find takers five years ago, with many resorts, malls and private homes now sporting vertical gardens. MRTS stations and the Chennai airport have also jumped on the bandwagon. Online portals offer components like containers and clamps for sale, hinting at growing interest.
 
 These gardens are ecofriendly in terms of water conservation, experts say. Drip irrigation is used for raising the plants, which is very cost-effective. All the plants used in the vertical gardens are indoor plants, Udhayakumar said.
