PATNA: Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park, commonly known as Patna zoo, lost its much-loved nine-year-old   Saraswati, who died due to heart attack on Monday night.

 Zoo authorities said Saraswati was much younger for getting a heart attack and detailed post-mortem is being done by a team of veterinarians in animal husbandry department and Livestock Research Centre of the state government.
 
 “Saraswati was quite fit and healthy, but she suffered a sudden severe heart attack on Monday night. A team of vets was immediately rushed to the night shelter house in the lion enclosure, who declared the lioness dead after preliminary diagnosis. A detailed post-mortem report on the cause of death is awaited in a day or two,” Patna zoo director Nand Kishor said on Tuesday.
 
 Saraswati was one of the two lions brought from Hyderabad zoo under an animal exchange programme in 2007. The other lion was a male, named Vishal. The two lions breed successfully in 2012 and Saraswati gave birth to cubs Samrat and Sheru.
 
 With the death of Saraswati, Patna zoo is left with four lions – three male and a female.
 
 Earlier, one of the four tiger cubs born at the zoo in March died around two weeks ago. Zoo director Nand Kishor said the cub had died due to low calcium deposition in its body, which led to weak bones.
 
 Prior to that, two more cubs from the same quadruplet had died within a week of their birth. All four tigers were born to white Royal Bengal tigress Swarna and normal coloured tiger Bheema on March 14. In March 2014, one of the four tiger cubs born to Swarna had died within a few days after birth.
 
 At present, Patna zoo has six tigers – three male and three female. Royal Bengal Tiger first came to Patna zoo in 1975, when Delhi zoo provided one male tiger, named Moti. In 1980, Assam government also gave two tigresses of wild origin to Patna zoo.
