 made his mark in Bollywood with his film, ‘Munna Bhai M.B.B.S’ starring   in the lead role. The filmmaker also took his level of direction to another level with ‘3 Idiots’ starring  ,   and R Madhavan’. While both of this film was super hit and is still loved by the audience, there is something that not many people are aware of the two films.

 Did you know that the climax of ‘3 Idiots’ was actually a scene originally written for ‘Munna Bhai M.B.B.S’? Reportedly, even before the director wrote ‘Munna Bhai M.B.B.S’, he was writing a story about three medical students. On a drunken night, they see a young woman in pain and they perform her child delivery. But in the later drafts, the protagonist switched from medical student to Munna Bhai and the scene wasn’t used.
 
 However, during the scripting of ‘3 Idiots’, the makers used this scene where the three medical students were substituted with three engineering students, which formed the climax of the film.
