PANAJI: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) may not be averse to allotting an   Cup slot to winners of the Super Cup, a competition that will involve four Indian Super League ( ) franchises.

  All India Football Federation ( ) and IMG-Reliance officials have held talks with the AFC during the Congress in Bahrain early this week and are confident that the governing body for football in Asia will have no objections if one guaranteed AFC Cup slot is reserved for the Super Cup, which will replace the existing Federation Cup.
 
  The Super Cup will be an eight-team competition involving four top teams each from the ISL and I-League.
  According to sources, the I-League will continue to remain the premier football competition and the winners will automatically qualify for the AFC Champions League play-off.
 
  “We will get to know about the actual allocation only later this month. We have asked for three slots: one AFC Champions League play-off and two for the AFC Cup,” said AIFF general secretary  , who attended the meeting in Bahrain.
 
  “Let’s wait and see what the AFC decides. Whatever the AFC decision, we will discuss and find a way forward. The AFC has not rejected our proposal for an additional slot (from existing two to three) or given any (other) assurances. We will know only on May 24,” said Das.
