VADODARA: The   (SOG) seized   and a number of fake documents from a man on Wednesday. 

 Shahnawaz Pathan, a resident of  , was nabbed on the basis of tip-off that he would pass from   with some fake currency notes. What stumped the police was that Pathan also had a fake stamp of the city police commissioner’s office. 
 
 “We found currency notes worth Rs 16,480 from Pathan. During questioning, he admitted to have made and circulated fake notes. Our team then searched his house and found lot of fake documents and stamps,” said H M Vyas, SOG police inspector.
 
  Pathan, who is class XII pass, told police that he took photocopies of smaller denomination currency notes and used them for buying things. After demonetisation and introduction of new notes, most people didn’t check whether the old notes of smaller denomination were genuine or fake.
 
 Pathan, who was an RTO agent, also used the fake school certificates and other identity documents to help people get driving license. 
 
 “To get driving license, one needs to be standard VIII pass according to new rules. Pathan used to sell bogus school leaving certificates and mark-sheets to those who hadn’t cleared standard VIII. The customers then used the bogus documents to get license. We also found a fake stamp of city police commissioner at his house,” Vyas told TOI. 
 
 Among the other fake documents, the cops seized 13 driving licenses, five election identity cards, two  , seven marksheets, 10 school leaving certificates, 16 blank marksheets and duplicate rubber stamps of RTO, lawyers and panchayat offices. 
 
 Pathan also kept a scanner and printer machine, computer and lamination machine at his house. “A similar offence of keeping bogus marksheets was registered against Pathan at Harni police station in April last year. We will try to find out as to how many such bogus mark-sheets and certificates Pathan made and who were his customers,” Vyas added.
