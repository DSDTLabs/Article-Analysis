AHMEDABAD: To spread awareness about mechanisms to help urban slum dwellers cope with adverse impacts of heat,   (MHT), a city-based cooperative, will be training social enterprises and NGOs. Representatives from Bengaluru, Nasik, Bhuvaneshwar and Chennai in addition to those from Dhaka, Bangladesh and Kathmandu, Nepal will also be present at the training programme, which begins on Monday.

 MHT was one of the eight winners of the Global Resilience Partnership (GRP) Challenge – a global effort to come up with sustainable and community-based solutions to adverse impacts of climate change.
 
 One of the major climate change impacts addressed by MHT is heat stress. “The primary focus of the training is creating further awareness about Heat Action Plan and how locals can be involved to inform citizens about the impact of adverse heat,” said  , programme manager, MHT.
 
 “Certain technology-based solutions such as replacing tin roofs in slums with specialized roofs and ventilators have been implemented in Ahmedabad,” said  , strategic advisor, MHT.
 
 “That apart, awareness programmes were created in slum areas about how to act when a heat alert is issued. If the same can be extended to different cities, one can develop a systematic approach to combat impacts of climate change,” Chauhan added.
 
 According to a nationwide study by MHT, slum-dwellers often live in houses with tin roofs and this doesn’t provide any relief from the heat as indoor temperature remains the same. Most of them are daily wage earners and their professions involve manual labour and higher exposure to direct sun, and therefore, their productivity goes down during peak summer months.
 
 “We hope to develop a participatory urban resilience model which targets slum communities and informal settlers across urban areas. This will be implemented by empowering the communities to take action and prepare for future climate risks,” Chauhan added.
