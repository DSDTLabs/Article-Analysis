BENGALURU: A 30-year-old   was allegedly caught peeping into the bathroom of an IIMB girls’ hostel here on Saturday night and handed over to Mico Layout police.

 Police said Girish, a resident of Mico Layout, was arrested following a complaint by a 27-year-old IIMB student and released on bail after an inquiry. They registered a case of voyeurism under IPC Section 354C.
 
 Girish had been summoned to fix a faulty geyser in N Block of   at Vijaya Bank Layout. He finished the repairs around 8pm in an upper-floor bathroom and while getting down, peeped into another bathroom on the fourth floor where a girl student was bathing. 
 
 When the girl noticed a stranger peering through the window, she screamed. Her hostelmates rushed to the spot and nabbed Girish. He told police he had not committed any offence as he was only climbing down the stairs after finishing his work and peeped into the bathroom to check if there was any problem.
 
 “He could have entered the room along with security staff. But he didn’t do that and instead peeped into the bathroom. The scared student filed a complaint,” a police officer said.
 
 Police said they have slapped a case of voyeurism and not trespassing as Girish had entered the premises with permission.
