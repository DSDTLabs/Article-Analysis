MOHALI: The Central government on Wednesday accepted the   governmentâ€™s proposal of setting up a government medical college in  . The college, with 100 MBBS seats, would be developed over 20.85 acres of land , of which 9.81 acres has been earmarked for civil hospital and 4.20 acres for State Institute of Health and Family Welfare.

 
 
 
  
 
 A Punjab government spokesperson said a stretch of 6.84 acres in   village has been acquired just 1.5 km from the district hospital, Mohali. The spokesperson said chief minister Captain   had directed the health department to acquire more land if required for the project.
 
 The estimated cost of the project has been pegged at Rs 374.86 crore.
 
 Of the total estimated amount, Rs 325.26 crore would be spent on building and infrastructure, and Rs 49.60 crore on equipment, said the spokesperson.
 
 He said under the terms of implementation of the Centrally-sponsored scheme, the Union government would release Rs 113.40 crore in three installments for equipment and infrastructural development of the college. The Punjab government has already made provisions for the project in its budget for 2018-19.
 
 The proposal for setting up the medical college had run into a controversy after the Punjab government had announced its plans for shifting it from Mohali to   due to unavailability of land.
 
 However, the government had later withdrawn its plans following sharp reaction from local politicians.
 
 Health Minister   had stated that shifting the college would have meant loss of grant.
 
 Even Union health minister   in a letter to the Punjab government in March 2017 had specifically told the state about keeping the college in Mohali only.
 
 Meanwhile, Captain Amarinder Singh in a statement said the establishment of the medical college would help provide the best health and diagnostic services to patients of nearby areas.
