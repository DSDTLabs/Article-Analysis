 The good news for Mumbai is that their skipper Rohit Sharma, who was on a long injury layoff since October, is back and will definitely be key to their success. Apart from Rohit, there are no real injury scares though Lasith Malinga and compatriot Asela Gunaratne are due, to miss the opener against Rising Pune Supergiant due to national commitments.
 
 
 MI have found a good balance to their side as they bought smartly in the auctions. They've retained 20 players from the previous squad. They've got back one of their heroes in the victorious 2013 campaign, retired Aussie tearaway Mitchell Johnson who had a productive Big Bash for Perth Scorchers. They have also got back Saurabh Tiwary after four years. Mumbai have always been a batting heavy team. They have Rohit Sharma and Lendl Simmons and big hitting all-rounder Pollard. They also have the dependable Rayudu and explosive opener Lendl Simmons, who can turn the game around. Their bowling department too is no less with the likes of Malinga, Johnson, Harbhajan and Bumrah.
 
 
 Mumbai have the reputation of being slow starters and they clearly, need improvement in this area. They are also over-reliant on the likes of Rohit and Pollard.
