PUDUCHERRY: Congress legislator V Vizeaveny from   has lodged a police complaint against the  's state president   seeking action against him for allegedly making casteist remarks against her. 

 Vizeaveny - elected from the Nettapakkam reserved constituency - and her supporters, mostly women, met the director general of police S K   on Sunday and submitted a two-page complaint. She gave a copy of the complaint to the station house officer of the PCR cell too.
 
 Vizeaveny, in her complaint, said Saminathan, while addressing a protest organised by workers of a corporation on Friday, termed her a 'cattle rearer' and also passed an adverse remark about her caste. 
 
 She said the BJP leader went on to the extent of declaring that people 'who reared cattle and collected dung to make cakes for using them as cooking fuel have become MLAs'.
 
 "If a BJP leader abuses and makes casteist remarks against an   in public, imagine the plight of common people from the deprived community encountering him," she said in the compliant urging the police to book   under the relevant sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 
 
 The legislator said the DGP had given assurance to probe into the episode and initiate appropriate action. Saminathan was nominated as a member of the legislative assembly of Puducherry by the Union government in June last year.
