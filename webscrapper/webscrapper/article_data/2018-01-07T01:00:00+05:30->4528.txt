BEGUSARAI: A brother and sister were thrashed by policemen after their bike collided with their bike in Begusarai district on Saturday, triggering protests by locals who blocked the   ahead of CM Nitish Kumar passing through the area for a programme in the district.

 After the collision, two angry bike-borne policemen thrashed the siblings and also damaged their bike near station chowk under the Balia police station area, Balia SHO Sunil Kumar said.
 
 The siblings have been identified as Mohan Kumar and Suman Kumari, residents of Janipur village of the district.
 
 The incident occurred when the brother and sister were returning from Barbighi village under the Balia police station area after seeing the dead body of their maternal grandmother, Kumar said.
 
 The incident angered the local people who blocked NH-31 (Begusarai-Khagaria main road) for nearly two hours, demanding action against the erring policemen. The policemen, who thrashed the duo, managed to escape from the spot after seeing the angry mob.
 
 Stern action will be taken against the erring policemen as per the law once they (policemen) are identified, the SHO said.
 
 Since the CMâ€™s programme was scheduled near Balia in the district on the day, police resorted to mild lathicharge after locals started pelting stones on them and cleared the blockade, the SHO said. PTI
