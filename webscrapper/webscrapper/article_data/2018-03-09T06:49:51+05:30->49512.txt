LUCKNOW: With just one more day to go for campaigning in   and   parliamentary bypolls,   chief   on Thursday directed party cadres to hold at least 100 'nukkad sabhas' (street corner meetings) in the two constituencies in support of the   candidates.

 Mayawati is learnt to have instructed a team of BSP leaders, led by her close confidante and Rajya Sabha MP Ashok Siddharth, to personally supervise the campaign. “We have been asked to campaign rigorously, as if our own party is contesting,” said a BSP functionary.
 
 The BSP chief's instructions come four days after the party announced support for SP in the bypolls, while seeking the latter's backing for a Rajya Sabha seat. Consequently, for the first time in nearly 25 years, party workers have been campaigning with flags of both SP and BSP.
 
 BSP sources said booth-level workers have been told to fan out in the respective parliamentary constituencies and launch door-to-door campaign. “There won't be any big rally. We have to campaign silently,” said a party coordinator seeking anonymity.
 
 Expelled BSP leader Indrajeet Saroj, who later joined SP, has been spearheading the campaign in Phulpur. A former BSP national general secretary, Saroj was instrumental in building BSP cadres in the region with a significant population of Pasis. Sources in SP said that Saroj has been roped in to give the much needed traction to the joint campaign in Phulpur.
 
 Political experts said that the by-elections would be a test of Mayawati's ability to transfer her vote in favour of an 'ally'.
