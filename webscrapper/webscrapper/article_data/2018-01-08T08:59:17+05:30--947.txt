 Faced with a severe fund crunch, PFA has been trying to get this message to the public through the caretakers and volunteers of the shelter.
 
 People can give their woollens, blankets, carpets and their pet dogs' used jackets, which could be used for strays, and can also contact the NGO on   or drop in anytime at the shelter to donate directly.
 
 "Pet dogs are usually safe because they get proper care. But the strays struggle during peak winter and we request people to donate their old clothes for the strays," said Latha, a rescue volunteer at PFA.
 
 Further explaining why they have launched this donation drive, Joshi said, "The costs to sustain and maintain the shelter, as well as those required to fight for animal rights are high, and we depend only on your donations to rescue, feed, provide necessary veterinary care, and fight for the animals".
