HYDERABAD: The  's order making Bharat Stage (BS) IV emission norms mandatory for new vehicles from April 1 is likely to bring down respiratory , skin and eye problems in Hyderabad by about 15% in the first year.

 The disease burden linked to automobile pollution will come down gradually as old polluting vehicles are phased out every year. The disease burden will further dip if road conditions are improved, point out health experts.
 
 The ambient quality of city air is expected to improve as the burden of automobile emissions containing particulate matter, black carbon, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide will come down considerably . Rough estimates put the overall reduction in automobile pollution particularly carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons by 3.33% in the first year itself. It will go down by 16.66%in the second year and 26.66% in the third year.
 
 Research studies show that automobiles in Hyderabad contribute 57%of the   in the city. Hyderabad has about 51 lakh vehicles of different types and description. If the average difference between the emissions of BS-III and BS-IV vehicles is multiplied with the total vehicle population in the city , Hyderabadis will get a major relief from heavy load of harmful substances as these vehicles are replaced over 15 years. For every kilometre run of vehicles in the city, Hyderabadis will see a reduction in carbon monoxide emissions by 5,10,000 grams and hydrocarbons by 3,57,000 grams.As of now, automobiles in the city together release carbon monoxide emissions of 10,20,000 gmkm and hydrocarbons emissions of 7,65,000 gmkm.
 
 In addition to the existing 51 lakh vehicles, about 1,70,000 vehicles are added on an average per year (if the average of last four years is taken into account).Non-registration of BS-III vehicles and sale of only BS-IV vehicles from April 1will bring down the carbon monoxide emission load in Hyderabad by 17,000 gm km in the first year, by 85,000 gm km in the second year and 1,36,000 gmkm in the third year.In case of hydrocarbons emissions, the load will come down by 11,900 gmkm in first year, 59,500 gmkm in the second year and 95,200 gmkm in the third year.
 
 Senior consultant physician Dr Hari Kishan Boorugu of  , Hyderguda, told TOI that high levels of automobile pollutants cause a spurt in asthma cases, worsen pre-existing asthma, and aggravate chronic bronchitis. “Reduced emission norms will improve air quality and thus the health of people,“ he said.
