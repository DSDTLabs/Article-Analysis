MARGAO: Following numerous complaints to the director of panchayats regarding the failure of the   to conduct mandatory gram sabhas for close to a year, a panch member has petitioned chief minister   to intervene in the matter.

 In a letter addressed to the CM, panch member of ward VI, Francis D’Costa, said complaints dated August 4, 2016, December 13, 2016 and March 6 this year were sent to the director of panchayats, Gurudas  , urging him to address the failure of Macazana sarpanch,  , to conduct gram sabhas. D’Costa claimed that Vaz would deliberately cancel gram sabhas by misguiding the panchayat secretary.
 
 Pointing out that ‘many important issues couldn’t be taken up for almost a year’, D’Costa further stated that the villagers of Macazana had also voiced a similar grievance to Pilarnekar, which hasn’t been addressed to date.
 
 When contacted, Pilarnekar said he has issued a showcause notice to the sarpanch, deputy sarpanch and four members of the seven-member Macazana village panchayat, demanding to know why they had failed to conduct mandatory gram sabhas. “They have to provide an explanation within 10 days of receiving the notice. If it is found to be unsatisfactory, a disciplinary hearing will be held to decide whether the sarpanch ought to be removed from office,” he added. 
 
 The director of panchayats disclosed that he had issued a similar notice to the Anjuna-Caisua village panchayat for its failure to hold gram sabhas for over a year. The matter is currently being heard.
