NEW DELHI: Funds collected as conversion and parking charges by the three municipal corporations in the past decade were either used for other purposes or unused. A large chunk of the money was used to pay salaries. This was revealed by reports submitted by the three civic bodies before a special committee of Delhi assembly on Wednesday.

 The funds were collected by the unified MCD between 2006 and 2012 and between 2012 and 2016 by the three civic bodies after trifurcation under the provisions of master plan of Delhi.
 
 The rules say that the parking charges should have been used to improve parking facilities. The conversion charges should have been utilised to upgrade the infrastructure to reduce extra burden on sanitation, maintenance or roads, footpaths, drains and manpower engaged in collection, monitoring and enforcement.
 
 The reports are likely to give ammunition to Aam Aadmi Party that has kept up its attack on the BJP-led civic bodies in the wake of the ongoing   drive. The party has accused BJP of corruption in the collection and expenditure of the funds taken as conversion charges from traders.
 
 Speaker Ram Niwas Goel had formed the 10-member special committee headed by MLA Bhavna Gaur on January 16 to inquire into the sealing drive, process of levy and utilisation of conversion charges collected by the corporations.
 
 The next hearing of the committee is on January 30 after which it will prepare a detailed report based on the submissions of the commissioners of the three corporations. The report will be sent to Supreme Court, which is hearing a sealing case, besides the SC-appointed monitoring committee to highlight that conversion charges collected from the traders were not used properly.
 
 The committee may request a stay on all sealing activities as a significant amount of conversion charges was “misspent.”
