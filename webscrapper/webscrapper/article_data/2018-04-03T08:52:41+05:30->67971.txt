BHOPAL: A district court in   on Monday sent 48 candidates, who were arrested in connection with the FCI  , to judicial custody while two middlemen were remanded in 10 days’ remand of MP STF.

 STF made a major breakthrough by arresting 50 suspects — including Delhi-based ‘middlemen’ Ashutosh Kumar and Harish Kumar — for allegedly leaking the question paper of recruitment exam conducted by   (FCI) on Sunday morning. The arrests were made from a hotel in Gwalior following specific intelligence inputs, said an officer.
 
 FCI is waiting for an interim report to decide on holding the recruitment exam again. FCI GM Abhishek Yadav told TOI that STF has asked them to tally the handwritten question papers with the one given in the examination. Officials say 99 questions matched with the FCI paper.
 
 It’s alleged that FCI had hired a Kolkata-based company, which sublet the contract to another firm. This exam was postponed a few months ago, said sources. STF is tracking down the source of the leak.
 
 The MP unit of FCI had issued a notification for recruitment of 217 watchmen. More than 1 lakh candidates applied and the exam was held at 132 centres on Sunday. STF sources say candidates who bought leaked question papers paid Rs 5 lakh each to middlemen, Rs 50,000 being taken in advance.
