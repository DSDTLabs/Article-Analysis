PUNE: Maharashtra retained its position as the state with the highest tree cover in the country. In fact, it recorded a marginal .08% rise over the last two years, the State of Forest 2017 survey indicates. 

 A net decrease of 17 sqkm has been observed in the state which can be attributed to rotational fellings, submergence, agricultural expansion and other developmental activities, the study said. 
 
 “Although a decrease of 149 sqkm has been observed within  , the overall decrease has been offset due to expansion of tree cover outside the forest areas. Rehabilitation efforts in the west coast have led to an increase in the mangrove cover of the state,” the report added. 
 
 Environmentalists said concerted efforts were necessary to ensure quality tree cover. “ The afforestation drive also needs a qualitative increase which is about the same species in the expanding reserve forest,” Ankur  , head of the department of biodiversity at   said.
 
 Patwardhan said while monitoring the tree growth in the Western Ghats over the last few years, they found an increase in the biomass. “In the protected areas of the ghats, the quality of tree cover has increased. But, in areas prone to disturbance, it has gone down. The growth rate of indigenous species is low as compared to foreign species,” he added.
 
 He said educational institutes, defence institutes and other private or public campuses should be included in the afforestation efforts. Defence institutes do not have reserved areas for forests but could have a quality forest on their premises, he added. 
 
 “Every year, people going to   can strew seed balls of indigenous plants along the wari route. Even if .01% of the seeds germinate, it could give quality to forest cover,” he said.
