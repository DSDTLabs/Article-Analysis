GHAZIABAD: A destitute woman, presumed to be in her seventies, was recovered by police who broke into the third floor flat she was alleged to have been locked in, in   on Saturday. 

 The flat belongs to Amit, an autorickshaw driver. Police said   brought the destitute woman,  , to his flat in   on Friday night and wanted to take care of her. 
 
 Amit was found sleeping in another room when cops broke into the flat. Neighbours, who heard the woman’s cries, informed police around 9am on Saturday. 
 
 “A family living on the second floor told locals they had been hearing the cries of a woman from inside a locked flat on the third floor for the past eight days. We went there immediately and heard the woman wailing. We could not enter the flat as its grille gate and main door were locked from inside,” said  , a resident of Vrindavan Enclave. 
 
 The team of cops that reached the society broke open the door of an adjacent flat. They went over to its rear balcony and entered the flat through a window. “The woman seemed to be mentally unstable. She was hungry and had been crying for food. The auto driver was found sleeping inside another room in the flat. He told us that he had found the woman wandering on the road and had brought her to his house to feed her and look after her. Investigations revealed that the allegation about the woman having been locked up was incorrect. 
 
 We have left the woman in the care of the auto driver who wants to look after her,” said Vijay Nagar SHO Naresh Singh.
