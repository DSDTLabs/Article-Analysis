NEW DELHI: A 28-year-old youth was   by a   on the suspicion that he had committed   at their haystack godown in northwest   late on Sunday. The youth’s body, which had multiple injury marks, was found in an open plot at Vijay Chowk on Monday by a morning walker.

 After the police questioned a few locals, they came to know that the youth had fought with a group the previous night a short distance from where his body was found. Subsequently, a case of murder was registered and six people were detained within three hours. Three of them confessed to having thrashed the youth on the suspicion of stealing things from their godown.
 
 The deceased, later identified as Shankar, was unmarried and lived in Jehangirpuri with his mother. His family said they got information about his murder after 24 hours of him being away from his house.
 
 The accused told the police that while crossing their godown they noticed Shankar trying to find something inside. 
 
 “They felt that Shankar had committed thefts there earlier as well and bashed him until he fell unconscious. Scared that he had died, two of the attackers took his body to the open plot on a motorcycle and dumped it. We haven’t found any cases lodged against the deceased. Shankar’s body was recognised by his sister, Manju,” said DCP (northwest) Milind Dumbere.
 
 Manju went to the plot after hearing that a body was lying there. “I saw a crowd of 200 people standing near the plot. When I went closer, I was shocked to find my brother’s body there. He was planning to give interviews at some call centres to support the family,” she said.
 
 Police said instead of taking the injured youth to a hospital, the attackers tried to destroy evidence by dumping the body 400m away from the godown where Shankar was mercilessly thrashed.
