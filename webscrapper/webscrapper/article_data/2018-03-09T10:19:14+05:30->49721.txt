THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: With the government taking a tough stand and criticism pouring in from various quarters, the managing committee of the   in   decided to scrap the ritual in which devotees were supposed to offer their blood to please the goddess. 

 The ritual was planned to be held at the temple for 10 days from March 12 as part of the annual  . The devotees were supposed to donate their blood using disposable syringes. 
 
 "The temple trust has no intention to go against the decision of the government and district administration. We are sad that the government and a section of the society portrayed the ritual in a bad light," said  , the tanthri of the temple. He said devotees believe that  , a ritual using human blood, will help cure diseases. 
 
 "It is an ancient ritual. The government and the public have been giving a false idea of it. We do not have any hidden agenda. Devotees were requested to collect their blood for the 'yajna'. The 'yajna' fire is holy and when we add a drop of blood to it, it absorbs energy. That's the reason why Hindu puranas have a number of blood-related rituals. It should be explained in a scientific way. Rather than thwarting the ritual, the government should have asked for a scientific briefing," Manikandan said at a news conference. 
 
 He said collecting blood was only a symbolic ritual and the amount of blood collected from a devotee will be less than that one gives for lab-testing. "We never forced people to come to our temple or to participate in the festivals. With the district administration opposing the ritual, we have now asked devotees to get a proper clearance for conducting it," he said. 
 
 Manikandan also claimed that devotees from other religions also worship the deity and they even conduct special rituals on Friday for Muslim devotees.
