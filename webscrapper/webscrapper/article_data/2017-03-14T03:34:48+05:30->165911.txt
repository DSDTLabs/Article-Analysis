MUMBAI: The Malwani police on Monday arrested one Venkatesh Kannupalan (30) for stabbing his room partner over a petty issue on Sunday. The incident occurred around 11.30pm at Budh Nagar in Malad (west) when a fight broke between the victim and the accused. Kannupalan stabbed Ajay Bansal alias Biroo (20) in the chest in the presence of their other roommate Sanjay Bansal. The accused was caught from the spot after the eye-witness alerted the neighbours and called the police.

 The three men stayed together in a rented accommodation in a chawl, which was arranged by their employer. On Sunday night they cooked and partied together. “Prime eye-witness Sanjay Bansal (20) said that the accused got annoyed when Biroo slapped him while they were fighting over who should charge the   first. The accused pulled out a cutting knife and stabbed Biroo,” said assistant commissioner of police Shrirang Nadgauda.
 
 In the complaint, Sanjay said, “For the last four months we three have been staying in the chawl and worked on different work assigned by our employer who gets work  . On Sunday Venkatesh had a fight with Biroo. Biroo wanted to charge his mobile and tried to unplug Venkatesh’s mobile which triggered the matter.”
