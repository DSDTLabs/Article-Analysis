AHMEDABAD:   investigating the   are working on the strong possibility that he might have been gunned down at the behest of an old rival. Police tried to search for Amreli-based Rajendra Shekhva; he was not found on Saturday and Sunday. Police have also got the names of two suspects who might have been the assailants in the case.

 On Saturday, Shah, a resident of Sparsh Avenue, Vasna, was at the Vishweshwar Mahadev temple near Jivraj Mehta Hospital at about 11.30am where he was shot from point-blank range by a country-made weapon. Shah died on the spot.
 
 Sources familiar with the investigations said that Shah, a transporter who used to get government contracts, was at loggerheads with Shekhva, also a contractor. Shah was named as an accused when Shekhva was shot at in 2009. The case was registered with the Ellisbridge police station in September that year. Two persons including a shooter were apprehended. The shooter is still in prison.
 
 “We are still piecing together the parts of the puzzle but we have learnt that Shah and Shekhva had a few encounters afterwards which did not go well as the attempts of truce had failed,” said an official associated with the probe. The official said that it is believed that two persons involved in the shooting on Saturday had stayed in Shahpur and might have got local help. “Shekhva survived the 2009 firing as the bullet had hit his shoulder,” the official said.
