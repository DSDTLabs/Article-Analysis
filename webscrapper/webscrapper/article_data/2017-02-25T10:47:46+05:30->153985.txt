AGARTALA: The opposition on Friday criticised the Left Front government in   for allocating the lowest amount of money for the health sector in the financial year 2017-18. 

  said the government had allocated only 4.85% of the annual budget to the sector, adopted incorrect recruitment policies for doctors and offered them a meagre salary without any perks and incentives. As a result, doctors were leaving the state after their completing   course, he added. 
 
 Nath also said the state-run medical college charged the highest fees in the country but had been running for more than a decade with visiting professors who were not part of the staff. 
 
 He alleged that such professors, recruited in almost all the departments, would visit for three or five days a month and get a sum of Rs 1.20 lakh. Neither were they involved in teaching nor in attending to critical patients, he added.
