TRICHY: A 30-year-old policewoman is under investigation for allegedly producing fake documents to get married for the second time, near   on Sunday. 

 The accused has been identified as Keerthi, a policewoman at Thiruverumbur All Women Police Station, who separated from her estranged husband owing to some issues. She was to get married for the second time at a temple in Trichy on Sunday. 
 
 In order to get permission to get married at the temple, she allegedly applied for a marriage certificate – by hiding details of her first marriage – at the   camp that was held in   a while back. Unaware that she was married and not divorced officially, village administrative officer (VAO)   had issued her the certificate for the marriage.
 
 Thiruverumbur tahsildar   said that when she came to know Keerthi had submitted fake documents to get the certificate she ordered Bhairavi to conduct the probe. 
 
 Following the probe, officials told Keerthi that the marriage certificate granted to her was not valid. Officials at the temple, where she was supposed to get married, were also notified and the wedding ceremony was stopped.
