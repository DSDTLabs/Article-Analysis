Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar, who is also the state’s finance minister, said on Wednesday that the Goa   would be presented on February 22. The Goa legislative assembly’s budget session begins on February 19 and concludes on March 21. 

 “The budget is a confidential instrument and it can’t be revealed, but it will be of a different style,” Parrikar said. He added that specific meetings for deciding the budget haven’t started yet, but that the budget is “an ongoing organic exercise”. 
 
 The 2018 budget will be Parrikar’s second after his March 2017 return to state politics after a short stint as defence minister. 
 
 Parrikar, answering a question, said that the state government gives more back to the people than what it collects from them as revenue. “Every month, as much as Rs 70-80 crore goes back to the people of Goa,” he said. “More than 80% of the state’s families are beneficiaries of government schemes.”
 
 However, Parrikar side-stepped questions pertaining to other business that would be undertaken during the month-long budget session.
