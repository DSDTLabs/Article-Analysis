BENGALURU: It has been a roller-coaster ride for the king of fruits this summer — though   have dipped, mango melas have been a huge success across the state.

 Karnataka continues to be on top when it comes to the number of registered mango growers among the largest mango producers. So far, 9,987 farmers from Karnataka have registered under the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority ( ) Mangonet, accounting for 50% of the number in the top eight states.
 
 The ‘mango-picking’ tourism of the Karnataka State Mango Development and Marketing Corporation Limited (KSMDMCL) was a hit. In 2017, a total of 528 customers enjoyed the opportunity of picking mangoes from farms and took about 15.16 tonnes home. The sale from the initiative totalled Rs 9.09 lakh. There were five programmes organized for mango picking as against the three held last year, said Kadire Gowda, managing director,  .
 
 The mango-picking experience came along with interactions with growers and listening to their stories. Citizens can book the bus on the KSMDMCL website, Gowda said, while releasing the season’s report in Karnataka. In 2017, KSMDMCL racked up a   of Rs 7.8 crore from the Lalbagh   alone. Melas across the state fetched it Rs 8.64 crore.
 
 Other popular ways of buying mangoes included online sales, mobile mango markets, district mango melas and fairs at Metro stations. In 2017, Karnataka recorded a total sale of 2793.30 tonnes of mangoes.
 
 However, mango exports saw a dip this year. In 2015-16, 6795.40 tonnes of mangoes were exported to USA, Australia, Europe, Central Asia and Southeast Asian countries, whereas this year (till March), the number stood at 6294.85 tonnes. The export revenue too dipped from Rs 59 crore to Rs 53.7 crore.
 
 “In future, we have plans to provide Global GAP certification to farmers with lands of 1000 hectares and above. Along with this, 100 scientific ripening centres have been proposed across state. We are aiming to take our produce from 10,000 to 30,000 metric tonnes,” said Gowda.
