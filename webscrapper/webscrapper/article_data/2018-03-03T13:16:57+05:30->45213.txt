Spring in the air, splash of colours and a stretched weekend set the mood for the residents celebrating   in the city on Friday. A part of the town was painted red, yellow and green, especially areas like   and Vepery.

 As the young and old armed themselves with pigmented powders and water guns to begin a riot of colours, in Sowcarpet, they were shot from different angles by a bunch of photographers, amateur as well as professional. The spray of coloured water suspended in the air, a young girl sporting the shades of a rainbow or a boy being doused with water from roof tops, all made for memorable moments on camera.
 
 While mythology connects the festival with the   over evil, for the merry-making bunch it is a celebration of the bond of friendship with another round of colour-smearing. And it ended with jalebis, dhoklas, samosas and the heady bhang.
