PATNA: Mathematician and Super 30 founder   has made an appeal to trainee bureaucrats to work for bringing change in society.

 Addressing a batch of Indian Administrative Service (IAS) trainees at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Mussoorie (Uttarakhand) on Friday, he asked them to transform their vision into reality and focus on development of the poor. He said training programmes should bring about lasting change in society by ensuring that benefits of government welfare schemes reach the targeted groups easily.
 
 “More than political leadership, bureaucrats can bring changes in society. For, they are the people who shape programmes and policies at the grass-roots level and ensure their proper implementation,” Anand said, adding there were numerous programmes and schemes for the poor, but the real issue was effective and timely implementation which only bureaucrats could ensure.
 
 Speaking about ‘Equity in Education’, Anand pointed out, “Equal opportunity should be given to each and every person. Equality in education can make a huge difference in society.”
 
 Citing examples of Super 30 students, Anand said it was just a matter of giving the right opportunities to the right people at the right time to witness extraordinary changes.
 
 Anand started Super 30 in 2002 to provide free coaching, food and accommodation to 30 students coming from the poorest strata of the society. Since then, over 396 students from the institute have cracked the IIT-JEE.
