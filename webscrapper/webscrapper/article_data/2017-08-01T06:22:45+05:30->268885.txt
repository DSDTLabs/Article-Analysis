NEW DELHI: Syed Ali Shah Geelani’s son  , who is on the NIA radar in the terror funding probe, failed to appear before the investigators on Monday.

 The agency had summoned him last week for questioning as, sources said, some documents have been recovered during probe which point to his active role in civil unrest in the Kashmir valley.
 
 Sources said that they will reissue summons to Naeem as his questioning is important in the case.
 
 A surgeon by profession, Naeem had returned from Pakistan in 2010 after spending 11 years there. 
 
 He is tipped to be the likely successor to Geelani-led Tehrek-e-Hurriyat, a separatist conglomerate comprising pro-Pakistan hardline groups. Geelani’s son-in-law   ‘Fantoosh’ has already been arrested by the NIA.
 
 Besides him, Geelani's close aides Ayaz Akbar, who is also spokesman of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat, and Peer Saifullah have also been arrested by the NIA. 
 
 Hafiz Saeed, the Pakistan-based chief of  , the front of another proscribed outfit   (LeT), has been named in the FIR as an accused besides organisations such as the   (factions led by Geelani and  ).
