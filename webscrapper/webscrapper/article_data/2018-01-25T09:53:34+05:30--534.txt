Though the curtain has come down on the Margazhi season, in Chennai, dance shows always find an eager audience. Hereâ€™s another bunch of artistes that is prepping up for a dance production on parrots. Put together by Dr Lakshmi Ramaswamy, its launch, a few days ago, saw a good turnout. It was an evening of coffee and conversation, during which the guests caught up with each other on the production and the latest happenings across various dance forms. In fact, with the presence of artistes from different fields, the evening saw a brainstorming session where they discussed the impact of art on society. Theatre personality YG Madhuvanthi was spotted among others and she took part in the discussion with great zeal.
