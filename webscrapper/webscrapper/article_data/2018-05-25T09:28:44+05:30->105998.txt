 Airport director   said, "A person, who identified himself as Parida of Khandagiri area in Bhubaneswar, repeatedly called up his office's landline number and hurled abuses at the airport officials. We received the call from 7873605933. He directed us to book a flight ticket over the phone. He even inquired whether he could smuggle drugs and ganja into the plane. We suspect that the caller was drunk." 
 
 However, the call turned out to be a hoax later. Police ruled out any danger, either to the airport or the PM, after a thorough investigation. An airport official said the caller threatened to blow up the airport if his ticket was not booked immediately.
