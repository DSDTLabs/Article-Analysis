NAGPUR: The   may have proposed long term capital gains tax (LTCG) at 10% on investment in equities, but some of the holdings may be taxed at 20% as well. These include shares purchased through initial public offers (IPOs), rights issues or even bonus shares, said chartered accountant Kailash  . He was presenting an analysis of the fine print of the   ( ) here.

 Jogani said even shares purchased before October 2004, when the securities transaction tax ( ) came into effect, will be taxed at 20% instead of the 10% rate mentioned in the Budget speech.
 
 Explaining the point, he said, the finance bill 2018 calls for 10% LTCG on stocks on which securities transaction tax (STT) has been levied. This implies, for the rest it will be the general rate of 20% applicable on other class of assets like  , land and jewellery.
 
 STT is charged on buy and sell transactions undertaken at the stock exchanges. However, shares acquired through IPO, rights, bonus, gift or even off market transactions do not attract STT as these are purchased out of the exchanges. Since STT has not been levied on these shares, the long term capital gains tax rate would come at 20% for such securities. This is because wordings of the amendment cover only shares on which STT has been paid, said Jogani.
 
 Apart from this, a blanket 20% LTCG would be charged on all shares purchased before October 2004 as there was no STT at that time, claimed Jogani.
 
 He said the grandfathering formula which will consider the price as on January 31, 2018, as the base for calculating capital gains will not be applicable for the   paid shares.
 
 He also said since the LTCG will be applicable from the new financial year onwards, a major sell off is expected in the markets before March 31. This is because till then no LTCG will be charged. There are chances investors will sell the shares by March 31 and buy again in the next fiscal.
