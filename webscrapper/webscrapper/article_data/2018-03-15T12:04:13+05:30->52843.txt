INDORE: Farmers in Indore division have sown   and tomatoes in significantly less area this year due to a sharp fall in prices last season. 

 Production of major horticulture crops of the region - onion, tomato and potato is likely to drop in 2017-2018 as farmers have switched area to chana and wheat hoping good prices. 
 
 
  
 “Acreage under onion and tomato has gone down this season in Indore division. Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season,” horticulture department’s senior official said.
 
 The official said, “Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.”
  
 In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals. 
 
 Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains. 
 
 “Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient,” said  , an agriculture expert.
 
 Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region. 
 
 Agriculture department’s statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division. 
 
 Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture. 
 
 Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, “Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand.”
