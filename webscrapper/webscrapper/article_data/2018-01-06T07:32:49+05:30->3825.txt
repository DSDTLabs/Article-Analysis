NEW DELHI: The country’s economy is estimated to slow to a 4-year low of 6.5% in 2017-18, dragged down by sluggish manufacturing and farm sectors and the impact of rollout issues linked to the Goods &   (GST) and demonetisation on businesses but most economists said they expect the number to be revised upwards as the second half of the fiscal year is expected to fare better. 

 Data released by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) on Friday showed the economy is estimated to grow 6.5% in 2017-18, slower than the 7.1% in 2016-17 and lower than the government’s estimate of 7.5%. The   expects the economy to grow by 6.7% in 2017-18. However, China is estimated to grow 6.8% in 2017, a shade faster than India’s estimated 6.5% which may upstage India’s fastest growing major economy tag. 
 
 Growth slowed to three-year low of 5.7% in the April-June quarter of FY18, hit by the impact of demonetisation and GST rollout issues but recovered to 6.3% in the July-September quarter. Since then a spate of data and estimates by multilateral agencies have showed that the economy has shrugged off the impact of the twin shocks and is poised to post good growth in the months ahead. 
 
 “Implicit calculation suggests H2 FY18 growth will be 7%,” chief statistician T C A Anant told a news conference as he presented an analysis of the first advance estimates of national income for 2017-18. The crucial farm sector is estimated to grow 2.1% in 2017-18, slower than the 4.9% in the previous year, while the manufacturing sector may grow by an annual 4.6%, sharply lower than the 7.9% posted in 2016-17. 
 
 The services sector, which accounts for nearly 60% of the economy, is estimated to grow 8.3% in 2017-18, higher than the 7.7% in 2016-17. “GDP growth of 6.5% for 2017-18 implies growth of 7% for the second half. Confirms strong turnaround of economy. Investment growth of almost twice of last year’s indicate investment reviving,” economic affairs secretary   said on Twitter. 
 
 Economists said the advance estimates may have been conservative in its assessment. “The advance estimates for the full year have been based on limited data, which would be available for a period of 6-9 months for different sectors. Therefore, they are not fully factoring in the expected pickup in growth in the later months of FY 2018, related to a favourable base effect and a ‘catch up’ following the subdued growth momentum in H1 FY 2018,” said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at credit rating agency  . 
 
 “Accordingly, the advance estimates for GDP and GVA growth appear to be understating economic expansion for FY 2018, in our view. At present, we expect GVA growth to rise to around 6.7% in Q3 FY 2018 and a sharp 7.5% in Q4 FY 2018. For FY 2018 as a whole, we continue to expect GVA and GDP growth to print at 6.5% and 6.7%, respectively, higher than the advance estimates of 6.1% and 6.5%,” she said. 
 
 The latest data comes weeks before the union budget for 2018-19 is presented in Parliament on February 1 and is expected to put pressure on the government to step up spending in key sectors such as the farming.
