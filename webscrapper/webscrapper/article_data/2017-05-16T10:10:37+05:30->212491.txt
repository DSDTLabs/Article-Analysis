Chief Minister   visited the   on Monday to supervise the   of the polluted  . While at it, he seemed concerned by the allegations that technology companies were looking to pull out of East Bengaluru because of its reputation for  

 BJP MLA from Mahadevapura Aravind Limbavali said the state government’s decision to levy excess tax in the tech corridor, especially the ITPL region, has forced many IT companies to move their offices from the region.
 
 “Already, the region has been paying the highest taxes to the BBMP. The government’s decision to levy even more taxes has forced them to move. Also, despite paying high taxes, they have been forced to function amidst garbage and crippled infrastructure,” Limbavali appraised the CM.
 
 A visibly upset CM reacted sharply to Limbavali’s concern. “Our government has provided enough facilities to the IT industry. One should not spread rumours like this or scare anybody that they all are thinking of moving out of East Bengaluru. Every citizen has to pay taxes. Because of this, BBMP is getting a revenue of Rs2,000 crore every year and it is able to present a budget of Rs10,000 crore. All this is being done with the help of government’s funding,” said Siddaramaiah.
 
 Referring to the piling up of garbage in the region, the CM said: “If you are complaining that garbage is dumped in Mahadevapura (IT corridor) then it was the previous government’s mistake as it increased the limits of BBMP. There is no point in complaining about it now. We have been working hard to set right those mistakes and will ensure that all problems are resolved at the earliest.”
