NEW  : The children felt orphaned when their mother was killed and their   was put in prison as an accused. Now that the father has turned out to be innocent, it still doesn’t compensate for the ordeal that the kids have been through in the last couple of months. 

 Even though my father was arrested, we were always sure that he didn’t kill our mother,” said the elder  . 
 
 The boys’ father and uncle worked as corporation sweepers to support the family. “In the last two months, we have realised the value of money. 
 
 My uncle earns Rs 4,700 per month, and we too want to contribute money. For that we have started interning with a DJ and will start earning in some time too,” said the elder son. 
 
 He also recalled what had happened on February 18. “My younger brother and I had gone to assist the DJ. When we left home at 8.45pm, my mother was in the kitchen. But when we came back after an hour, she was nowhere to be found. 
 
 “After waiting for some time, I called up my father and asked him to come home. By 12 am, he was here. He waited for my mother till 2 am, but assuming that she went out with her male friend, he locked himself inside his room,” the boy said. 
 
 When she didn’t return until the next afternoon, the husband was convinced that she had eloped. Later in the day, the woman’s body was found; a day later, the male friend was found murdered too. The boys’ father was put behind bars on suspicion.
