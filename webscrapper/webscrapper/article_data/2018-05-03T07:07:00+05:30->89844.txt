JAIPUR: A 21-year-old Bikaner youth, who was abducted and thrashed by relatives of a girl who objected to her dating a man from a different community, died at a hospital on Wednesday morning. 

 Saif Ali, who worked at a fruit market, was abducted in a car by about eight people from near   when he was heading for meeting the girl on Tuesday night.
 
 "From Rampura, he was taken to Karni Nagar industrial area, where he was severely beaten up by the accused persons. They broke his legs and punched him unconscious," said district superintendent of police (SP) Sawai Singh Godara.
 
 The assailants repeatedly punched and kicked him, due to which Ali began bleeding profusely. "They threw him in a wastewater pit. While he was \beaten and left to die, some workers of the nearby factories spotted him and informed the   police. The cops rushed to the spot and admitted him to a hospital," Godara added.
 
 At 3.30am, Ali succumbed to his injuries. A case has been registered against the eight persons,  . "We have rounded up three suspects; they are being interrogated," Godara said. Initial investigation indicates that the girl belonged to a Hindu family and her relatives had reprimanded her for seeing Ali. "It is yet to be verified, but it seems that her family had objected to their inter-faith relationship," said a police officer, adding that an FIR has been registered against the accused persons under different sections of the IPC, including  , kidnapping, etc.
 
 The police said that on Tuesday night, Ali had gone to meet the girl, but her relatives had got a whiff of his plans and hatched a conspiracy to eliminate him.
 
 "The matter is serious, we are investigating the case. The body was handed over to the deceased's family after postmortem" Godara said.
