Ahmedabad: While the state is all geared up to welcome the monsoon and the state administration is going all out to ensure better water conservation and storage through ‘Sujalam Sufalam’ initiative, recent cases registered by the state Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) throw light on the leaking points from where the efforts trickle away.  ACB officials said that in past two months, they have registered nine cases related to water management in Gujarat.  In the same period, the agency also conducted a major search operation at the headquarters of Gujarat Land Development Corporation (GLDC) and found a total of Rs 56.5 lakh cash — the biggest haul from a government office in an ACB case. It started with a case filed by Bhuj office of ACB on March 24 against two officials of water conservation department and a private contractor where the trio showed farm ponds dug on paper in Rapar taluka and incurred loss of Rs 2 lakh to the government exchequer.  The details came to light when ACB investigated the allegations and did not find the ponds at the spots shown in the government records. The same modus operandi came to light when ACB filed four cases in Valsad district on May 24 where collectively the government exchequer incurred loss of Rs 31.79 lakh by not making 35 farm ponds in four different villages of the district and still showing their completion on paper.  The entire initiative had been taken after the search at GLDC office and getting details of possible scam. “The plan is on cards to get the dug-up ponds measured by expert field engineers to ascertain whether the work for which money has been paid in many instances matched the quality standards set by the government of Gujarat,” said a senior ACB official.
