PANAJI: The   (GPCC) may have promised to evict offshore and onshore casinos from the state if it wins the upcoming elections. But the party leadership, both at the state and Centre, appears clueless about how it plans to do so.

 When quizzed on Friday, All-India   (AICC) general secretary   said the party would do it “if the law permits”, while Congress leader  , said the party would “not betray Goa on casinos”. Both, however, failed to provide any roadmap on how the Congress plans to move casinos, especially offshore casinos out of River Mandovi into the high seas.
 
 “BJP had promised something else and then went on to enhance the number of casinos in the river. We are very clear that we will not have this. The nexus between casino owners and BJP has gone on for five years and we will end it,” Pilot said.
 
 Singh appeared cagey when asked about the party’s strategy to shut them down.
 
 “The Congress has said no to casinos and if rules permit, they would be pushed offshore. If law and rules permitwhere pushing them out is concernedwe can do it by cancelling the licences. Whether we should allow them in the river front is the question,” Singh told reporters.
