RAJKOT: Scuffle ensued at a tollbooth near   after a car driver tried to break the barricade and pass without paying the tax on Wednesday. 

 The car’s windshield was damaged as the automatic barricade closed when he tried to escape. This enraged the driver and he and several others got into a heated argument with the tollbooth staff.
 
 There has been a huge rush towards Kagvad for the installation ceremony of   deity   scheduled on January 21. 
 
 Though no formal complaint was lodged, police deployment has been increased to avoid any escalation of such issues at tollbooth as heavy rush will continue till Saturday. “One car owner tried to pass through tollbooth without paying toll tax and as the system is automated, the windshield of the car broke as the barricade closed before he could pass. There was tension for sometime but the matter was resolved amicably,” a police officer said.
