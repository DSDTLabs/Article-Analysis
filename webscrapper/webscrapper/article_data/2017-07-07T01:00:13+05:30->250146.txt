Singer   has cleared the air that he has not quit   yet, as was earlier reported, but has become sick of the negative and abusive comments from trolls.

  In an interview with The Sun, the songwriter said, "I've actually come off Twitter completely. I can't read it. I go on it and there's nothing but people saying mean things. Twitter's a platform for that."
 
  "One comment ruins your day. But that's why I've come off it. The head-fuck for me has been trying to work out why people dislike me so much," he added.
 
  Well, he's not giving up on Twitter entirely, he's just not going to bother reading it for now.
 
  To clarify his comments on the abuse, he took to his   and posted a picture captioning, "Loads of Hoo-har about me quitting stuff. I haven't quit anything, I'm just not reading anything, except  . Hope everyone had a wonderful July 4th yo (sic)"

  The 'Poker Face' hitmaker took to his Instagram Account and posted a picture with the 'Shape of You' star and wrote, "What an incredible talented artist I LOVE ED @teddysphotos deserves all our love and respect like all humans do. I wish all people on the internet would be positive and loving and apart of creating an online community that is kind and empowering, not hateful and mean. No reason to tear down an artist simply because they are on top. Work harder to be kinder everybody. That should be your first duty to humanity."
