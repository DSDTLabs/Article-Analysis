AHMEDABAD: Gujarat   chief   directed police agencies, departments and police stations across the state to post women at at least 33% of significant posts.

 In a letter shot all range heads and police commissioners,   said that he noticed that officials posted at important agencies and departments are not transferred as often and stay at those posts for long periods of time.
 
 “This sometimes deprives more capable and efficient policemen and officials a chance to work at important posts and places, especially women police and officials,” Jha wrote.
 
 Jha directed all districts and cities to assess the capability of women police personnel and deploy them in rapid reaction (RR) cells, detection of crime branch (DCB), prevention of crime branch ( ) , the special operations group (SOG) and surveillance squads of police stations across the state.
 
 Jha’s letter says he noticed that women personnel and officers are mostly deployed as wireless or telephone operators, or to maintain records or as police station officers ( ) and at fixed places, depriving of the chance to display their talent and capabilities.
 
 “This is improper and everybody should be given a chance to prove their worth. Women police personnel and officers should also be involved in important investigations. I have given directions across the state to execute these instructions and submit an action taken report in a month to the DGP’s office,” added Jha.
 
 For the past few years, there have been 33% reservations for women in police recruitments. Jha said that more or less the same proportion should be maintained at important posts and agencies.
