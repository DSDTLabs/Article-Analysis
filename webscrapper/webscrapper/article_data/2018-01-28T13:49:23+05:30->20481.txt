Veteran Bengali film actress   died of a severe   at her residence here early on January 26. Her daughter Soma Chatterjee spoke to us about mother's generous and loving nature. Read on to know more...

 Said Soma, "  was a heroine, a powerful actress and the idol of her fans — but above all, she was a kind-hearted, giving person who loved her family. In fact, she was very attached to my children. Even at the peak of her career, she never ignored her family. Not many will believe that after shooting the entire day, she would happily go into the kitchen to cook for many. She was a generous and warm host. Her interest was in inviting people over for food and adda and she loved to cook for them."
 
 On Supriya Devi being called a   by many, Soma added, "Ma was a style icon too. So many people used to copy the way she dressed and wore makeup. But I feel — and Ma too felt the same — that she didn’t get her due from the industry. So many people are remembering her now and I’m sure she must be happy to see this from wherever she is.
 Her interest in cooking is well-known by now, but what many people don’t know is that she would look into the minutest details of the kitchen —including how the vegetables were being cut. There were days when I would see Ma getting angry with the domestic helps, as they had cut the vegetables all wrong. But for the last couple of months, she had lost interest in these things. I guess she could feel that her days were numbered.
 Ma was a good human being, which is why she felt no pain. She was feeling   and had a cardiac arrest and passed away in my lap. Wherever you are Ma, may you keep smiling."
