CHENNAI: On Valentine's Day, police often play spoilsport for young couples. This V-Day, Mylapore deputy commissioner of police V Balakrishnan has decided to be a different, urging young people to present   to   in their locality. 

 "The recent protests on the Marina showed the power of the youth. So I thought of channelling it to reach out to senior citizens," says Balakrishnan. "Apart from gifting flowers to their loved ones or taking them out for dinner, each youngster can present a flower to any elderly couple living alone," he says. Police have a list of senior citizens and can facilitate this, adds Balakrishnan.
 
 His inspiration is a devoted couple on the Kutchery Road pavement. "On Tuesday morning, when I was returning from my night shift, I saw the old couple walking. I have known them for almost a year," says Balakrishnan. Police tried to place them in a home for the elderly, but the couple was not keen. 
 
 "When I saw them, it struck me that though they are old, they are always seen walking together, holding onto each other. "
 
 
 
 
 
 On February 14, he plans to gift flowers to that couple and other senior citizens living alone or in old age homes. "We have homes for the elderly in Mylapore and Foreshore Estate, so I will visit one of them, and spend some time with the people there," he says.
 
 His men will follow suit. "We already have a senior citizens protection programme for which we have put together a list of vulnerable elderly people, especially those living alone," says Balakrishnan, adding that there are 1,000 such people in his jurisdiction. Beat officers in each of the three sectors regularly interact with these senior citizens, offering help. 
 
 But, on V-Day, "We will meet and greet them with roses. It will help establish better rapport between the cops and the senior citizens," says Balakrishnan. People interested in being part of this initiative can contact the  's office in Kutchery Road police station.
