With summer comes new fashion trends and our fashion-forward peeps love experimenting with all that. To their excitement, the city has been witnessing several back-to-back fashion expos. From summer clothing to accessories, this one had all the fashion essentials. It was a preview show put up at a newly opened pub and it had all the happening people in the cityâ€™s fashion circuit on the guest list. Sameea, one of the newest modelling sensations in the city, was spotted there. Her appearance in a tank top and a pair of torn jeans quite matched her spunk and attitude. Pawan in an off-white jumpsuit and Nupur in a tie-front top and bell-bottoms, too, looked stunning.
