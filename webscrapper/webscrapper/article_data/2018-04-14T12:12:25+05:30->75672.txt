PATNA: Union minister Ashwini Kumar Choubey’s son Arjit   on Friday demanded a high level probe into the recent communal violence at Nathnagar in Bhagalpur.

 Shashwat, who had been arrested and later released on bail in connection with the Nathnagar clash, alleged that some officials in Bhagalpur district administration had misled the government in connivance with   and RJD netas.
 
 Shashwat had been named, besides seven others, in one of the two FIRs lodged at Nathnagar police station following communal riots that broke out on March 17 after some people objected to playing of loud music during a procession led by him to celebrate the New Year as per the Hindu calendar.
 
 Addressing media persons here, Shashwat said the Bhagalpur district administration has so far not been able to produce any evidence against him. “The allegations were false.   Ajeet Sharma and some RJD netas in Bhagalpur connived with officials to malign my image,” Shashwat claimed.
 
 He said raising slogans like ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Bharat mata ki jai’ was not a crime.
