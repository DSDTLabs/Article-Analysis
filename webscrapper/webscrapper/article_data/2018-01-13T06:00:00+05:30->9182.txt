Who doesn’t want to learn a new recipe or two? Especially, when the recipes come from a masterchef and they’re all low-calorie and healthy! No wonder then that this cooking workshop by masterchef   was such a hit. The   ladies turned up in full force to watch Smita’s demo on healthy salads and desserts, including quinoa salad, soba noodle salad and chocolate mousse. Later, there was a quiz on healthy cooking. A fun day out, indeed!
