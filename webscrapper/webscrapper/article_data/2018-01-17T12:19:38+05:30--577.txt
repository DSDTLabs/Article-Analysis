BARNALA: Following a road accident, a clerk posted at the office of Barnala DC died on Tuesday. The Punjab State Ministerial Services   alleged that nobody cared for the victim,  , in the emergency of the civil hospital and he died of excessive blood loss.

 Gurmeet (44) was coming in an auto-rickshaw from Handiaya when a private bus hit the vehicle from the rear.   sustained serious injuries in the accident and was rushed to the Barnala civil hospital. 
 
 Angry over it, employees at the DC office handed over a memorandum to the Barnala DC Ghanshyam Thori to be forwarded to Punjab health minister Brahm Mohindra for action against those responsible for not taking care of their seriously injured colleague. Union district president Nachattar Singh Bhairupa said Gurmeet could have been saved had the doctors attended him. “We want justice for the bereaved family,” he said.
 
 Barnala civil surgeon Sampuran Singh was not available for comments despite repeated calls.   said action was being taken against the bus driver. The Barnala DC said, “An inquiry has been marked to the ADC and if any laxity is found on the part of medical officers, appropriate action will be taken.”
