While the civic body through decentralised waste collection and disposal is confident of reclaiming the 47.5acres of land used as dump yard, somehow the degradable and non-degradable   and burnt along street corners has failed to catch the attention of the civic body. Even though the authorities were intimated about such miniature dump yards, a section of the residents lamented that the civic body had failed to check the micro dump yards in almost all the neighbourhoods.

 As   has been gradually removing the dust bins placed in public places for people to make use of the door-to-door waste collection system, a section of residents who fails to hand over waste to corporation workers have been dumping the waste on street corners. "Fault is with both residents and civic body. Local people who fail to hand over waste to sanitary workers have been dumping it on road corners or vacant plots which was subsequently burnt by sanitary workers," S  , resident,   said. As the sanitary workers are burning waste in streets, the process damages a portion of wall close to the site. C Balasubramanian, honourary president of  , said the civic body should not abruptly remove the bins from public places until the residents are accustomed to hand over waste by the door-to-door waste collection system.
 
 Senior officials reacting to the grievance promised to convene a meeting for all sanitary officials to identify public spots where waste is dumped and burnt. Absence of enforcement measures such as levying penalty on residents for dumping waste on roads were also cited as a reason for the mess.
