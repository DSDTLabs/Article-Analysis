 Around 8.25pm on Sunday, when Naseem and his family were returning from the dargah in an auto and the vehicle was passing by a narrow road, a bike on which three persons were travelling came from the opposite direction.
 
 “Since the road was very narrow, one of the two vehicles had to go back to make way for the other. When Naseem’s brother Syed Muqhtar Hussain asked the three youngsters on the bike to give space for their auto, the youngsters refused. During this conversation, one of the youngsters started abusing them, to which Naseem took objection and got off the auto,” Pahadisharif sub-inspector Puri Jagannath said.
 
 According to the police, one of the three youngsters whipped out a knife and attacked Naseem on his shoulder.
 
 Since a lot of people were on the road near the dargah, the three fled after the attack and abandoned their bike.
 
 Police registered a case under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). During the enquiry, police came to know that Ahmed Bin Saleh, Hasan Bin Ahmed and Hussain Bin were the three accused.
 
 Naseem is out of danger, police added.
