NEW DELHI: Last year, China shut down 128,000 web sites and deleted as many as 4.55 million online posts, Chinese state media reported today.

 The reason for this, according to the state-controlled media, is that these sites and posts considered "obscene" or "harmful" by the Chinese government's national office for the fight against pornography and "illegal publications", said  . 
 
 Incidentally, China has for the last three years been considered the worst abuser of Internet freedom. It's been on the top of a list of countries with the world's worst  , ahead of even Syria and Iran.
 
 China claims though that last year it received as many as 121,000 reports of undesirable online content from the public. Thereafter, it says more than 900 criminal cases were investigated, with 1,900 people receiving criminal penalties.
 
  
  
  
 "There's the mirage of having ordinary people enjoying freedom when the reality is anything but," said Maya Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, to the UK's Financial Times (FT) last November. 
 
 The study on internet freedom by  , a US state-funded non-profit organisation, found that new restrictions on media outlets and surveillance measures for social media sites increased both self-censorship and state  . The country's Great Firewall system censors web sites and the government has criminalised some kinds of Internet speech.
 
 "One of the most worrying developments is the new cyber security law where companies have a greater onus to engage in censorship of their users," said William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, to FT last November.
