CHENNAI: It has taken 46 years for an American to feature in a World   championship final. Late World champion   did it back in 1972 and   repeated that feat late on Tuesday night as he reigned supreme at the Candidates tournament in Berlin, thereby becoming the next challenger for current World champion  . The two will battle it for the World title later this year in London.

 
 Caruana, playing with black pieces in the 14th round of the tournament, defeated Alexander Grischuk to pocket the title with one full point ahead of Azerbaijan Grandmaster Mamedyarov Shakhriyar and Russia’s Sergey Karjakin. Shakhriyar drew with Ding Liren.
 
 What was most impressive about Caruana’s run in the competition was that he led the eight-player tournament from start to finish. Barring the blip in fortunes when he lost to Karjakin, Caruana was in control of his ship right through the sail. The loss to Karjakin in round 12 was followed by Caruana raising his game when it mattered the most - winning the final two rounds - against Levon Aronian and Grischuk respectively. 
 
 The final round saw Aronian close his campaign with a quick draw against   in a contest that lasted 17 moves. The clash between Ding Liren and Karjakin was a keenly-contested one. However, the two did called truce and split points after an intense battle that lasted 45 moves. Once this contest concluded, all that Caruana needed was a draw to ensure a shot at the $117,827 tournament prize.
