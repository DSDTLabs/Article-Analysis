CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu has slipped to the third spot in the ranking for states based on health indices for 2015-16 from second position in 2014-15. While Kerala retains its numero uno status,   is now ranked the second best. 

 The 'Healthy States, Progressive India Report on the ranks of states and UTs', compiled by the Niti Aayog with the Union ministry of health and family welfare and the  , list some key factors that led to the state's decline - increase in low birth weight by 3% in 2015-16 compared to the previous year, a wider gap in sex ratio at birth from 921 to 911 and decline in percentage of children receiving full immunisation. The declining sex ratio at birth has been a cause for concern as sex ratio in some northern and central districts dropped to less than 900 in 2017. 
 
 The state has, however, earned top marks for registering maximum number of pregnant women during the first trimester and achieving 100% registration at birth. 
 
 
 
 
 The under-5 mortality has also decreased from 21 per 1,000 births to 20 per 1,000 births. While Tamil Nadu topped the list of states that recorded “least improvement” among large states, Kerala is first among those which had “not improved”.
 
 Officials pointed out that the data for many indices presented in the report was profoundly different from the state’s own data. For instance, the national report shows that the percentage of institutional deliveries — sourced from the Health Management Information System (HMIS) — declined from 86% in 2014-15 to 81% to 2015-16. But state reports have consistently maintained that the percentage was well above 98%.
 
 “There is a fundamental flaw in the way they have arrived at the calculation,” said director of public health Dr K Kolandaswamy, the   and  . “We issue only nine lakh birth certificates and most women deliver at hospitals. We have validated our reports in hilly and difficult areas and home deliveries are less than 0.5%. Even the recent edition of the NFHS (National Family Health Survey) shows we have 99% institutional deliveries,” he said.
