LUCKNOW: Has the infamous Noida jinx started haunting chief minister  ? He bravely broke the jinx (that any CM visiting the place loses elections) amid much praise from media and in political circles, he has lost four back-to-back elections in the state after visiting Noida and Greater Noida in December. Thereafter, he has visited the NCR region several times.

 
 The jinx started during the regime of Veer Bahadur Singh in the late 80s, when he was removed by the   leadership as soon as he came back from a Noida trip.
 
  
  
 
 Since then, successive CMs have been avoiding going there. Rajnath Singh didn’t go there during his regime between 2000 and 2002. Mulayam Singh Yadav did pay visit in 2003, but has not been able to become the CM after his tenure ended in 2007.   as CM also visited the place for inaugurating Metro service in 2011, but faced a crushing defeat in 2012.
 
 Akhilesh Yadav, an engineer by education, therefore, preferred to totally avoid Noida and Greater Noida when he was the CM from 2012 to 2017 and inaugurated mega projects for the NCR from his 5, Kalidas Marg residence in Lucknow. 
 
 Yogi Adityanath, however, declared that he might be a devout Hindu, but did not believe in superstitions and 

 
   went to Noida first in Decmeber 2017 
 
 to welcome PM Narendra Modi, who was visiting to inaugurate a new Metro line.
 
 While 

 
   Yogi was praised for defying this superstition 
 
 , Modi lauded him by saying that "Faith is important but blind faith is not desirable." 
 
 However, after successive losses in  , the same jinx has made a combeack to the whispering galleries of UP’s power corridors.
