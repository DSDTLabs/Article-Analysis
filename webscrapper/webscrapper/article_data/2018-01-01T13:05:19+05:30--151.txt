SURAT: The   (SMC) officials demolished over 200 huts near   waterworks on Saturday.   had encroached upon a portion of 1.02 lakh square metre land reserved for waterworks for second time in 15 days.

 SMC employees, under police protection, had demolished at least 780 huts at the same site a fortnight ago, which was the fourth time in past five years. Slum dwellers had pelted stones at the   resulting in injuries to a few of them last time. The civic body left the space open after taking possession and the same people encroached upon it again. 
 
 “We demolished more than 200 huts at the same place on learning about the encroachment. We will take care that such a situation doesn’t arise again,” an SMC officer said. 
 
 The officer said this place has become a den of   who build huts and then rent them out.
