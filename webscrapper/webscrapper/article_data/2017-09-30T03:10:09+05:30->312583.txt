Mumbai: When Tushar Patil took the stairs leading to   Road station’s foot overbridge that witnessed a stampede, thoughts rushed to his mind about how he had escaped it by a whisker in the morning.

 Patil had to thank his stars, as like others, he too was planning to wait on the FOB for the rain to subside as he did not have an umbrella. “I don’t know what struck me, I decided to leave and got drenched,” said Patil.
 
 A few minutes after he reached office, a colleague informed him there was a stampede on the stairs leading to the FOB. “I am lucky to have escaped. This disaster was waiting to happen,” said Patil.
 
 Most   travelling back home shared their morning experiences with colleagues and friends. Many tried to identify the bridge which saw in images circulated in the morning.
 
 Some were shocked to know the incident occurred on the staircase leading to the flower market and not on the connecting bridge. “This is not usually crowded. Many people waited back for shelter due to the rain,” said Girish Khandalkar, an Airoli resident, who was at the station in the evening. Sona Gupta, a CA, said the staircase is very steep and narrow.
 
 Mayur Ghadge, a Ghatkopar resident, said, “I initially thought it was the connecting bridge between the central and western lines. That is usually more crowded.” The railways should do something about the connecting bridge, he said. “If a similar stampede occurs there, more would have lost their lives,” Ghadge added. 
 
 Many shared theories about how the tragedy unfolded, which they heard from friends or fellow commuters. But for most commuters, it was business as usual. They ran to board their trains back home on time without apprehension about the tragedy in the morning.
 
 Pravin Vichare, a commuter, said the bridge was probably more congested due to Dussehra. “Many were carrying bundles of flowers down the bridge to the flower market in the morning and some flowers are still lying there.”
