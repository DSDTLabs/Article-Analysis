Mangaluru: Kids his age are busy scribbling on the wall or watching cartoons on TV in loop, but four-year-old Arnav   is making   appearances for some time now. 

 Though he's not fully conversant with the alphabets, he's fast emerging as a Yakshagana prodigy, playing the roles of a priest or of   and delivering the dialogue cogently. His mother   says he's first in the family to take up Yakshagana. The boy developed a keen interest in the art form as his grandparents used to take him to Yakshagana performances regularly.
 
  Shreelatha said: "He seems to be averse to Bollywood and Western art forms. I enrolled him for Bollywood and drum classes, but he chose to quit both of them. And he loves the art and culture of   - Yakshagana and Pilivesha (tiger dance), among others. He has been attending Yakshagana classes for 10 months." 
 
    Alevooraya, his tutor, heaped praise on Arnav, one of  's favourite students. His Yakshagana debut was through a play that stretched for at least 12 hours. "He never skips classes. In addition to theatre, he is learning Chande Vaadana, besides evincing interest in   band. Such interest is very uncommon among present-day kids," Ravi said. 
 
  During Navaratri last year, Arnav had become the cynosure of all eyes in the popular Barke tableau, where he danced as pili the entire night.
