MUMBAI: The   is likely to opt for status quo despite the March 2017   being much below the targeted level at next month's policy review, analysts have said. 

 "Although the CPI inflation is likely to significantly undershoot the March 2017 target, we do not expect a repo rate cut in the upcoming policy review in April 2017, with the   firmly focused on the medium term target of 4%," rating agency Icra's managing director Naresh Takkar said. 
 
 Apart from the challenge of getting inflation down to 4% which was flagged by governor   at the last review, one of the biggest factors influencing the analysts seems to be the shift in the policy stance to neutral. "The RBI surprised with a shift to a neutral stance in February. Rates will remain on hold at April's review," analysts at Singaporean lender   said. 
 
 As against the RBI target of 5%, the CPI inflation for March came in at 3.7% in February. It, however, is expected to rise further. The medium term target for RBI is to get inflation down to the 4% level. Icra said it expects the CPI number to rise up to 4.5% for March as the favourable base continues to fade. The agency's call of a status quo is driven by "greater emphasis on bringing inflation in a durable manner to 4%". agencies
