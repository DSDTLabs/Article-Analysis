  The character of Porus, essayed by Sunil Sonu, and that of Alexander by Ali Khan, was done justice to by the actors for which they received a huge round of applause from the audience. Talking about the play, director Hafeez said, "It took me around two months to prepare a play like this. Inspite of Porus being such an integral part of Alexander’s conquest, no one really knows about him. So through this play, I wanted to highlight the character of Porus."
