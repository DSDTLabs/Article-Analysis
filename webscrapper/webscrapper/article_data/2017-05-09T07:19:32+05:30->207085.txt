NAGPUR: Consumption of liquor could be the cause of the murder of an unidentified man, in his late 20s, at   shortly before Saturday midnight last week. Police said the argument between assailants and victims had taken an ugly turn as they were in an inebriated condition. 

 On Monday, Pachpaoli police procured remand of two alleged assailants, Tularam Dharmik and Chandrashekhar Bhisikar, up to May 12 after producing them before court. A 16-year-old, also named in the murder, was sent to government observation home by the juvenile justice board. The motive of the murder was to teach the victim a lesson for trying to dominate the assailants in their neighbourhood, police sources said. 
 
 Dharmik, Bhisikar and their minor accomplice were miffed with the unidentified man as he was hurling abuses at them under influence of alcohol. The minor was booked for murder last year too. In the latest incident, the minor thrashed the victim with his belt as Dharmik stabbed him in the lower abdomen. It was also learnt that Dharmik had picked up the knife from a stall of a vegetable vendor for attacking the man who too had picked up a brick for retaliation. Dharmik and Bhisikar did not had any crime record in the past.
 
 Though the police had immediately identified the three including the minor after the murder through   footage, the victim could not be identified even after 48 hours of the incident. Unconfirmed sources have relayed to cops that the man’s name could be Rajkumar but he also had ‘Laxmi’ tattooed on his hand.
