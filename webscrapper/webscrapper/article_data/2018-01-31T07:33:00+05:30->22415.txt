Chandigarh: Union home minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday lauded Punjab police’s success for cracking targeted killing cases and gunning down dreaded gangsters, including Vicky Gounder and Prema Lahoria, in a recent encounter.

 During his Chandigarh visit on Tuesday, the home minister congratulated Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh during his lunch with Governor VP Singh Badnore and the chief minister. The meeting was aimed at deliberations on internal security and cooperation between the state and the Central government to maintain peace and stability in the region. Besides Punjab DGP Suresh Arora, chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh also attended the meeting.
 
 On the occasion, the chief minister sought a grant of Rs 50 crore from the home minister while emphasizing on the necessity for modernisation of the state police force to meet the prevailing challenges. Amarinder underlined the need for having a high level of security network in Punjab as it is a sensitive border state. He also stressed upon the need to have fool-proof security in jails. The chief minister also reiterated his earlier request for two companies of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) for replacing the Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) in Punjab jails. He informed the home minister that his government had already initiated sweeping reforms for prisons.
 
 Lauding Punjab police and intelligence agencies’ efforts in cracking down on criminals and organized gangs, the Union home minister assured the Punjab government of all possible support of the Central government.
 
 After the Punjab police’s Organised Crime Control Unit gunned down three gangsters, including Gounder, on January 26 in Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan, another gangster Ravi Deol on Tuesday surrendered before the Sangrur district court. He was wanted in as many as seven criminal cases, including smuggling of drugs.
