LUCKNOW: Sacked by the   (AIMPLB) for proposing an out of court settlement for Ayodhya dispute, Sunni cleric, Maulana Salman Husaini Nadwi took to twitter to validate his stand, drawing from a sixth century incident in  . 

 Nadwi tweeted images of pages from the biography of Prophet Muhammad by Islamic scholar   in English,   and Hindi. 
 
 The cleric said that it was in fact the Prophet's path (Sunnat-e-Nabi) that people, irrespective of their religions and differences, come together against injustice.
 
 Called Hilf al-Fudul, an alliance, Nadwi said was convened by  , the eldest uncle of Prophet Muhammad, when the latter, also a participant in the meeting, was only 21 years of age. 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Nadwi said, "At that time too, people were against the meeting and the agreement made to protect the oppressed from injustice. It was called interference. The same has happened with me now when we are trying to hold meetings to find a peaceful settlement to Ayodhya dispute."
 
 In sixth century, a trader arrived in Mecca from Yemen but the head of Quraish tribe refused paying anything for his ware. Az-Zubair then convened a public meeting and it was decided that members will come to the help of any and every oppressed person in town," said Nadwi.
 
 "Similarly in Ayodhya dispute, we need to work together and find solutions for sustained peace, but some people are calling my involvement as an interference."
