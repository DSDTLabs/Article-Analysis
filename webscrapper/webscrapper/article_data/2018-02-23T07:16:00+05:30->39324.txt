GURUGRAM: The Haryana State Pollution Control Board ( ) on Thursday sent notices to all highly polluting industries, asking them to install online real-time monitoring machines to measure air pollution levels.

 
  
 
 
 Sources said the data collected by the online facility would be monitored by the pollution board to ensure more transparency and better vigilance. Pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, will be measured.
 
 “As per the guidelines of   (CPCB), all grossly polluting industries have now been directed to install the online system. The facility for real-time monitoring of industrial pollution will enable us to check emissions on a continuous basis as it will be connected to our server. While some industries have already installed measuring units for water pollution, no industry in the city have a real-time online monitoring facility for air pollution,” said a senior official of HSPCB.
 
 “This will make the system more transparent and provide us evidence if pollution level is more than the permissible limit,” the official said. In September 2017, the CPCB directed all grossly polluting units to install electronic data transmission facility to monitor pollutants released in air.
 
 Industrial associations have expressed concerns. “It is definitely a good step to ensure that pollution levels are being checked without any break. However, the cost of the real-time monitoring device is a concern. The government should make some provisions for certain subsidy,” said  , president of Gurgaon Udyog Association.
 
 At present, industrial pollution is monitored by HSPCB which carries out inspection and collects samples on quarterly and half-yearly basis. The problem with the prevailing system is that most industries follow the norms only when they are inspected by the board.
 
 The city has 833 polluting industries, all in red (highly polluting) and orange (polluting) categories.
