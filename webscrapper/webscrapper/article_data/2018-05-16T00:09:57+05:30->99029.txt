Kochi: Former   A V George, who is under suspension in connection with the Varapuzha custodial murder case, was quizzed by the special investigation team once again on Tuesday evening at a ‘safe house’, near Central Police station for over four-and-a-half hours.

 The team headed by S Sreejith, Inspector General of Police, questioned him from 3.30pm till 8pm. The investigators had interrogated George at least twice before. Official sources said that they are yet to decide on arraigning him as an accused in the case.
 
 George was placed under suspension by the chief minister’s office after an SIT report found lapses on the officer’s part in handling the investigation which led to the arrest of Sreejith S R, the custodial death victim. The report filed to the state police chief also found irregularities in the functioning of the now defunct Rural Tiger Force (RTF) formed by the then Rural SP.
 
 George was transferred out of law and order and was given charge as SP (training) at the Kerala Police Academy on April 21 before he was placed under suspension. He had dismantled RTF soon after the arrest and death of Sreejith S R.
 
 Sources with department, meanwhile, claimed that the investigation is moving in the right direction. George had earlier told the SIT that he had sent additional force, including the RTF, to Varapuzha as there was tension prevailing there. However, there has been no direct communication about nabbing Sreejth. The SP had also claimed that he had deputed the Aluva DSP at the site.
 
 The case pertains to the incident on April 6 when Sreejith was taken into custody by three police officers of the RTF in connection with a house attack case. As many as nine officers are accused in the case now, including former Varapuzha SI Deepak G S and the North Parvur CI Crispin Sam. The Varapuzha SI and the three RTF personnel are the only ones facing murder charge.
