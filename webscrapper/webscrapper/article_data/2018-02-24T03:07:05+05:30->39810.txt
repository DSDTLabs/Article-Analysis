NEW DELHI: The   has registered a   to investigate the death of a 23-year-old   of a luxury hotel who was   at the house of his   in   last June. 

 The FIR was lodged on Friday after the late Arnav Duggal’s mother approached the court, alleging foul play. 
 
 Arnav lived in West Patel Nagar and had left home on June 12, informing his parents that he would be late. His mother Anu Duggal said around midnight she tried his number but found it switched off. When he didn’t return the next morning, she started calling his friends when she received a call from Dwarka police to visit Shakuntalam apartment. 
 
 “When I reached, I saw policemen carrying his body into an ambulance. I was told that my son was found hanging from a ceiling fan at one of the flats. But there were no eyewitnesses, nor any suicide note,” Anu said. 
 
 She said the police took her to the flat, but she didn’t find any rope or any damage to the ceiling fan caused by hanging. “I presumed foul play. During the probe, a lot of discrepancies were found, which led the court to order the police to register a murder case,” said Anu. 
 
 The family also alleged that the police didn’t secure the fan as evidence and the owner sold it later as scrap. “The court has also ordered an inquiry against the investigating officer for lapses in the probe,” said P K Dey, the Duggals’ lawyer.
