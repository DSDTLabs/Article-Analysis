BENGALURU: The Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath ( ) and   seem to be on a collision path after the latter slapped a fine of Rs 5 lakh on the civic agency for generating garbage during the Sunday's  . 

 On Wednesday, the CKP dashed off a letter to BBMP alleging its officials of misconstruing information. The Parishath demanded details from BBMP on such action taken against other violators and the amount of fine collected from them.
 
 The Palike sent a notice to CKP on Tuesday, asking it to pay the money in a week for not taking adequate steps to dispose of garbage generated during Chitra Santhe and for failing to ensure proper sanitation in and around Kumara Krupa Road. 
 
 "We had taken permission from the departments of police, transport, fire, health, BBMP and other agencies before the fair. The allegations made by BBMP officials are baseless. The move is uncalled for," said KCP president B L Shankar in his letter mayor G Padmavathi.
 
 Shankar sought to know whether the civic agency was proactive in punishing other violators. "If so, I request them to disclose the fine amount collected so far," he added. Explaining the measures the CKP had taken, Shankar said they had given a contract to a private agency to dispose of garbage before midnight, but there was a little delay and the same was removed in the morning. "While regretting the delay, we would like to say the fault is not as big as made out to be, deserving such a huge penalty and action under the Karnataka Municipal Act," he claimed.
