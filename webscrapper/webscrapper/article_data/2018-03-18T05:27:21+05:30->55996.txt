NEW DELHI: As the AAP government continues to oppose the sealing drive in the capital, Union minister Hardeep Singh Puri said "hard decisions" need to be taken to make the city liveable though the measures may attract brickbats from some quarters. 

 Reacting to the demand of a central ordinance by chief minister Arvind   to stop the drive, Puri said there was a tendency to "highlight victimhood" as part of "populist politics" in a democracy. The Union minister said he would meet Kejriwal on Monday to discuss the issues related to the capital, especially the sealing drive and the metro phase-IV project.
 
 The minister said   had "every right" to amend the master plan 2021 to solve the problems of Delhi. Pointing out that the master plan had already been amended 248 times, Puri said, "We have substantive proposals to rectify the situation. At the end of the day, everyone's objective is to make Delhi a liveable city." Delhi, he added, has become unliveable in terms of pollution, parking and congestion. "I do not think anybody committed to Delhi will allow this to happen." 
 
 The master plan, formulated in 2007, "did not anticipate" the demographic and infrastructure pressure the city would be subjected to, leading to the violations of the plan and encroachments on government land, Puri said. pti
