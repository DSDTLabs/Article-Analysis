LUCKNOW: Unfazed by a feud raging in his family and a widening rift in the Samajwadi Party, Uttar Pradesh chief minister   Yadav is adding the finishing touches to his “development-oriented” manifesto for the forthcoming Assembly elections.

 The manifesto, say highly placed sources, promises three new greenfield expressways that will cover more than a dozen districts at a cost of Rs 60,000 crore. These expressways would cover over 1,000 km in the state, including Bundelkhand.
 
 “In the past five years, Akhilesh has been emphasising road connectivity and giving high speed to agricultural activities and trade. In the manifesto, which is being prepared under his supervision, these three prestigious expressways find a prominent place,” said a source close to the CM.
