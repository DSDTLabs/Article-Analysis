While the civic body is planning to set up   around the lakes, the three   in the city still continue to be either   or under-utilized. The city’s UGSS coverage is also around 60% only, said a corporation official. More than 71,200 household connections were to be provided in the 60 wards of the old city. 

 The   sewage treatment plant, which has a capacity of 70 MLD per day, treats only about 30-40 MLD of waste water. The Ondipudur plant is still running on trial basis as the house service connections have not been provided yet. The Nanjundapuram sewage treatment plant is stuck as the corporation is yet to call for fresh tenders.
 
 “We await certification on the work completed by the previous concessionaire by the GCT College of Technology. After we get details such as amount spent and the status of work completed, we will work on the estimates and call for tenders,” said city corporation commissioner  .
 
 Regarding the other two STPs, corporation engineers said that they were getting at least 50 new connections per day. “The state government wants us to achieve 100% UGSS connections by year-end and we are working towards it,” said an official.
 
 The corporation aimed to provide 16,874 connections but has only provided around 50%, so far. The corporation had laid drainage pipelines for more than 280km from 2009 to 2014. The third phase of the project that required another 297km of drains to be laid has been in progress since 2013.
 
 Officials said that various factors such as litigations and highway clearances had delayed the project. “We have won the case in the national green tribunal and in another eight months’ time, we will set up Nanjundapuram STP. Once house service connections are provided, these three plants will become fully functional,” said a senior corporation official.
