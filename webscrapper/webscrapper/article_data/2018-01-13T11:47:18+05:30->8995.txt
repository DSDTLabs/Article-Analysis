PATNA: A   has been filed in the   against the   to students and teachers of all schools across the state to participate in human chain formation on January 21. The petitioner alleged that it was violation of human rights.

 The   on January 11 had issued order to the middle, secondary and higher secondary schools to remain open on January 21 and ensure the participation of students and teachers in the human chain formation against child marriage and dowry. The government order also mentioned that midday meal would be given in the middle schools on Sunday and teachers would be responsible for the safe return of the students, the petitioner said in the PIL filed on Friday. The students from Class I to V would be exempted from participating in the event and teachers would be given compensatory leave against their duty on Sunday.
 
 Petitioner  , through the PIL filed by his counsel Ritika Rani, has urged the court to quash the education department’s order as forcing students to take part in the human chain formation is their exploitation and against their dignity and privacy rights.
 
 The petitioner also alleged that the participation of students and teachers in the human chain would amount to criminal misconduct under The Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, at the cost of public money.
 
 The petitioner has also cited a Delhi high court’s order in which it had made clear that no other work except of teaching would be taken from teachers.
 
 A PIL was also filed last year before the high court against the government’s order to ensure students’ participation in human chain for creating awareness against liquor and drugs after which the government had clarified before the high court that it had only appealed to students for participation voluntarily.
