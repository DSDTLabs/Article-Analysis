CANACONA: Throwing their weight behind incumbent MLA and sports minister  , a majority of the Canacona   block committee’s workers threatened to resign, together with members of the party’s  , if the   ticket was not given to him. 

 “Tawadkar has played a major role in strengthening the BJP’s structure in Canacona. But now, when the time has come to declare a candidate for the assembly election, the party is considering fielding Vijay Pai Khot. This is surprising, given that Khot hasn’t done any kind of work for the BJP over the last five years,” Canacona BJP block committee president Mahesh Naik, said.
 
 Committee vice-president Sanjay Komarpant said although defence minister   had last month assured that Tawadkar would get the Canacona ticket, some senior party leaders were considering Khot instead. “If this is true, we will resign and work towards Khot’s defeat,” he said.
 
 Addressing reporters on Thursday, a group of office-bearers and members of the Quepem mandal of BJP, besides some members of the panchayats in Quepem constituency, all belonging to the scheduled tribes community, threatened to quit enmasse if Canacona MLA, Ramesh Tawadkar, is denied the party ticket to contest the February 4 election.
