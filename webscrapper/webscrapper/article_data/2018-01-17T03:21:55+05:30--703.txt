 According to DCP (special cell) P S Kushwah, the accused Narender smuggled the notes in from Pakistan and sold it for 30% commission. The accused was nabbed by a team on a tip-off. “Narendra was last arrested in 2016 by Rajasthan police with a consignment of Rs 1,000 notes.
 
 This is the third seizure of new notes in the last few months, indicating that Pakistan-based printers have been able to print a sizeable amount of new notes in the year after demonetisation. Earlier, the cell had nabbed a smuggler with notes having the face value of Rs 6.6 lakh and 5.5 lakh in November and December.
 
 The accused has disclosed that they procured the fake notes from a Pak-based man who delivered the consignment at the border by throwing the consignment packet above the wire fencing. Many others from villages near Malda and Farakka are also indulging in this business.
 
 According to police, the notes are of very fine quality and it was difficult to differentiate with genuine notes at first. A few of the security features like watermark, security thread etc have also been incorporated. However, there are certain evident discrepancies if scanned in bulk. “Fine quality of texture paper was used and security features have been inserted. The fake currency was not easily detectable,” Kushwah added.
