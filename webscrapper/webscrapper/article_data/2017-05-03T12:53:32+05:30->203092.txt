 When told about DGP Anurag Sharma's dismay and remark that Digvijaya's statement would only demoralize the police force, Srinivas said he believed it would certainly go beyond that. “It is necessary that the government should take action. It could lead to Digvijaya's arrest or a defamation suit being slapped against him. The government will take an appropriate decision,“ he said.
 
 Describing the senior Congress leader and former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh as someone who completely lacked credibili ty, Srinivas said the Congress leadership should also react to his statements.
 
 “All political parties should speak up against Digvijaya. He has a penchant for raking up unnecessary controversies everyday to survive,“ he said.
 
 Srinivas asked Digvijaya Singh to produce evidence in support of what he said or else tender an apology and withdraw his statement.
 
 When pointed out that the DGP had not specifically replied to the remarks and claims made by Digvijaya Singh, the TRS Rajya Sabha member said the fact remained that the Congress leader's remark could demoralize the police force.
 
 “Digvijaya Singh has to produce the evidence because it is he who has made a claim,“ he said.
 
 Srinivas also urged the Union home ministry to study the series of tweets made by Digvijaya Singh and come to a conclusion about what action needed to be taken.
