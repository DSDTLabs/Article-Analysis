Mumbai: Making it easy for the candidates to contest elections to the civic bodies and nagar panchayats, the   cabinet of Tuesday decided to allow for self declaration by candidates that they have washrooms either in their house or use a public toilet.

 The rule earlier was that the local urban body would certify that a candidate had a toilet in their house or was using common toilets. The state government will be issuing an ordinance to amend the existing rule. It is mandatory for candidates contesting elections to give a declaration to show that they use the toilets and are not defecating in the open, this has been done to keep in line with the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan initiative launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi .
