NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing blame game between   over  , Yogendra Yadav’s   India, which will debut in active politics with this year’s civic polls, is starting a campaign asking people to seek accountability from both parties in power.

 On Saturday, Swaraj India announced its plan to launch on Sunday ‘Jawab do, Hisab do’, a campaign where citizens can demand accountability from the government. In the next one month, party members will go door to door asking people about their grievances and posting it on public grievance redressal portals of the   government and the BJP-ruled corporations, said Anupam, its spokesperson. The municipal elections are scheduled in April. 
 
 “The litmus test of democratic governance is local governance. The tragedy of our democracy is that we pay least attention to local bodies like municipality and panchayats,” said  , national president of Swaraj India. 
 
 The party has formed a team that will collect data about various problems faced by people. “A good deal of misgovernance that ordinary citizens experience—in sanitation, colony roads, local parks, primary schools and local hospitals etc—is due to malfunctioning of municipal corporations. Yet the corporations get the least attention from all—political parties, bureaucracy, media and even ordinary citizens themselves,” said Yadav.
 
 To correct this imbalance, the campaign will build pressure on the political parties at the Centre, state and municipal levels. “Our slogan is teen sarkar, teeno bekaar,” said Anupam. The campaign will end with a rally at Ramlila Maidan. “We will have issue-centric stages to highlight all problems,” he added.
