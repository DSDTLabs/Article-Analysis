CHANDIGARH: The   cabinet on Thursday put its final stamp on the long-pending decision of granting sand mining contracts through progressive bidding rather than the ongoing practice of reverse bidding.

 The state government wants to curb illegal sand mining and earn additional revenue of around Rs 400 crore by adopting progressing bidding method. The reverse bidding process capped the bidding price at the mine but as soon as the sand reached the market it was sold at inflated price. But under progressive bidding, the   would be auctioned at its real value.
 
 The council of ministers, under the chairmanship of chief minister  , decided to re-auction all sand mines as the Supreme Court had on May 10 given a green signal to the state government’s decision to replace reverse bidding. The Supreme Court had put brakes on mining activities across the state with directions to contractors to remove machinery from mining sites so that these could be re-auctioned on better commercial terms.
 
 After Thursday’s decision, the state government would pay existing contractors, who had mining contracts through reverse bidding process, an advance profit amounting to Rs 11 crore for the balance term of their contracts. As the mines would now be re-auctioned, the advance profit given to existing contractors would be added in the reserve price of the mines at the time of their re-auction.
 
 The Punjab cabinet had taken a similar decision in its April 19, 2017, meeting and was to convert contracts of mines allotted through reverse bidding as per average per tonne bid received for the mines auctioned through progressive bidding. But the contractors approached the Punjab and   high court, which disposed of their petition on January 12. Later, they filed 42 appeals in the Supreme Court, which on May 10 directed the state government to carry out an assessment and pay advance profit to contractors by May 25.
