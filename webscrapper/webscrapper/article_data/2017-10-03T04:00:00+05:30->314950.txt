Porbandar:  

 Dr Nagendra, a professor at BMS College and others, had arrived specially on Gandhi Jayanti to visit Mahatma's birthplace. “We reached there at around 8am but were stopped from entering. We were asked to wait till the President’s visit was over. But we did not have so much time,” said Nagendra.
 
 Rita Shanta Kumar, who had come from Delhi, said, “It is very sad that people are being stopped from visiting the birthplace of Gandhiji even when they are coming from so far.”
 
 Ultimately, the tourists were allowed to enter, but only one by one.
