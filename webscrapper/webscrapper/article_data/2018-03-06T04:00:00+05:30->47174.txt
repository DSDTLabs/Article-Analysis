Chennai: In a pincer attack strategy, British cult motorcycle brand Triumph is targeting the two ends of the fast growing 250cc -700 cc luxury motorcycle market through its own subsidiary as well as the partnership with Bajaj Auto. Triumph Motorcycles India, the brand’s 100% subsidiary in this market, is focusing on the 500 cc plus market in a bid to take on market leader Harley Davidson. “The 500 cc plus motorcycle industry is where Triumph is focusing directly in India and to that end we’re moving from imports to full assembly. Last year 90% of our portfolio were CBU imports but by end-June this year 95% of our portfolio will be CKD assembly,” said Vimal Sumbly, MD, Triumph Motorcycles India. That includes the Bonneville Speedmaster launched on Tuesday at a price of Rs 11,11,500. The partnership with Bajaj Auto, on the other hand, will focus on the 250-700 cc segment with jointly developed products for the Indian and other markets. Triumph, he said, clocked retail growth of 17% in the July 2017 to January 2018 period and is looking to close the current year with 1,300 units or 10-15% growth. “Our next products will be the Tiger 800 and Tiger 1200 and within these two ranges we will have 4 models in India,” said Sumbly. “This shows the intent of brand Triumph in India as a focus and strategic market. We’ve opened our 15th dealership in Gurgaon and will follow up with two more in Mangalore and Goa taking our network to 17 strong. We’re increasing both product and network,” he added. Triumph expects its double bill strategy to turn its Indian presence into a 1,00,000 units market. “The partnership with Bajaj Auto is with a view that the industry and volumes will grow,” said Sumbly. “And the mid segment is growing rapidly in India. Today the 250-500 cc segment is roughly around 8,00,000 units a year dominated by Royal Enfield followed by KTM and Bajaj. This segment has the strength to go to 1 million units,” he added. The partnership is focused on making bikes in India which are mid segment at a particular price point while Triumph India will focus on the higher end of the market. What drives this ambition is that fact that between Fy14 to Fy17, motorcycle sales in India overall grew at a 2% CAGR but the 500 cc plus segment grew at 22% CAGR. “Triumph has grown 66% and become the second largest luxury motorcycle brand in India with 19% marketshare, after market leader Harley Davidson. The others in this segment are Kawasaki, Ducati and BMW. The entire segment is priced at Rs 4.5 lakh and above. “From 2006-2007 to 2017 luxury car sales in India went from 5000 units to 38,000 units,” said Sumbly. “Luxury in India is moving towards mass market and motorcycles too are moving in that direction. This is because of millennial customers who look at the EMI versus the actual cost. Our finance penetration this year should be 75%,” he added.
