KOLKATA: “Decision apna hai” (It's my decision). These words of  , to his childhood coach  , after announcing his shock retirement on Wednesday might have caught others completely off guard but Bhattacharya is not surprised.

 Talking to TOI from Ranchi, Bhattacharya said: “He took the correct decision at the right time. Before the selectors removed him, it was wise to step down on his own. I am not surprised at all.”
 
 With the series against England coming up, is it not the wrong time to give up captaincy? “Not at all. I fully support his decision. Before the bullet hit him, he moved away from its path,” said Bhattacharya.
 
 Critics have been questioning Dhoni's hunger for the game after 12 years of international cricket but Bhattacharya maintains his ward still has the passion and the game to keep excelling at the top level. “When he was in Ranchi during the off-season, he regularly trained at JSCA and didn't take a break for a single day. That's his dedication towards the game even now.”
 
 Does he see Dhoni figuring solely as a batsman in the ODI set up? “Of course. Provided he maintains the same fitness level and doesn't get injured,” Bhattacharya signed off.
