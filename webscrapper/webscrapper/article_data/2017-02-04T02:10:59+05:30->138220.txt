Hyderabad: Swiss   player Agility Logistics Pvt Ltd, in partnership with German packaging solutions provider va-Q-tec, on Friday inaugurated its first temperature-controlled life sciences storage and handling facility in the Hyderabad Airport area.

 The 6,000 sft leased facility, which is called Life Sciences Excellence Center (LSEC), will cater to pharma manufacturers in Hyderabad, Goa, Pune, Vishakhapatnam and Bengaluru. It has been set up at an initial investment of Rs 50-60 lakh.
 
 va-Q-tec managing director Dominic Hyde pointed out his company will be renting out containers to Agility, which will be using them to transport pharma goods.
 
 Agility South Asia CEO Detlev Janik said that if the centre takes off, the company may mull setting up its own centre here.
 
 “Hyderabad is at a strategic location that has the potential to become a logistics hub. We have been given a mandate to double in size our business in India. Our intention is to make India and China comparable. We need to grow substantially and quickly here,” Janik said.
 
 In India, Agility operates from 61 locations and controls 150,000 square meters of warehouse space covering all major ports, airports and inland locations in the country. With revenues of around $4.3 billion, it has 22,000 employees in over 500 offices across 100 countries.
 
 Janik added that the roll out GST will prove to be a game changer for the sector as a complex tax structure is a major impediment to the growth of the logistics business in the country. The other bottlenecks, he pointed out, include lack of adequate infrastructure and trained manpower.
