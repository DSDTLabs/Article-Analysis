MADURAI: People belonging to 56 villages in and around Kamudhi in   left on a 16 day journey in 316   to offer worship to their   in   district, keeping up a 200-year-old tradition. 

 Natives of Ahathairuppu village near Kamudhi in Ramanathapuram district worship their family deities in Virudhunagar once in three years by travelling to the destination on bullock carts. Later, due to drought and other conditions, they undertook the journey once in four years. This year, their journey to the temples began on Thursday.
 
  Strict discipline is maintained along the route where overtaking the cart in front is prohibited. They are allowed to stop at specific spots on the route. 
 
  "After reaching their destination, families go to the temple housing their deity and participate in a series of rituals there, before converging again at the Koodamudaiyar temple after two days," said Selvaraj, a villager. They sacrifice goats and later sit down to a grand feast.
 
 
 
 
  Govindarajan of Ahathairuppu says almost all those who participate in the festival are well settled and have their own vehicles, but continue to go by only bullock cart as a tradition.
 
  This year there was a problem finding adequate bullock carts, and they had to rent them out from the neighbouring districts for as much as 20,000 for sixteen days. The women say that though held once in four years, the tradition helps them build their family ties with many of them getting to know each other, as they get acquainted on a daily basis for half a month.
