PATNA: A 30-year-old woman has lodged an FIR against a top   for Population Activities ( ) official accusing him of sexual harassment and character assassination during her association with the UN body. The FIR was filed on Wednesday at the Pataliputra police station.

 The woman also wrote to external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj on February 2, requesting her to waive off the diplomatic immunity to the UNFPA official.
 
 In the FIR, the woman alleged that the UNFPA official had touched her inappropriately on several occasions during his visit to Patna in March last year. When she resisted his moves, the accused, with the help of another UNFPA official, started tarnishing her image and ruined her professional life, the FIR alleges.
 
 The woman was associated with UNFPA for gender alliance programme in   through an NGO. Working as state manager for the programme, she and her team developed mobile-based ‘Bandhan Tod’ app with an SOS button for rescuing children from child marriages and creating awareness against dowry atrocities. The state government is also associated with the project.
 
 “I had to coordinate with several ministers to get work done. My trouble started with the success of the project,” she told TOI over phone.
 
 “UN’s HR mission headed by   visited Patna in November last year for assessing the project. I was asked to depose and I narrated all my ordeals to the mission members. But I was never provided a copy of my disposition,” she said, adding that UN funding to the gender alliance programme in Bihar was stopped in December.
