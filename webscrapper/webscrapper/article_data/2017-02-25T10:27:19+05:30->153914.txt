MANGALURU: Absence of mofussil, city and express buses on the roads sees start to a day where right wingers gave a call for district wide hartal against visit of Kerala CM   to the city.
 
 Police authorities who maintained overnight vigil and ensured miscreants did not target long distance overnight buses, removed burning tyres from roads at couple of places. City police also arrested leaders of many Hindu organisations as a precautionary measure in an overnight swoop to ensure that hartal call does not gather steam on ground.
  
 DCP M Sanjeev Patil said, Barring JnNurm buses, other private buses, that form lifeline if city's transport, and autorickshaws are off the road. The bus owners could have kept off the road fearing violence and resultant losses, he said. Incidentally, miscreants had targeted a few   on the city outskirts late on Friday notwithstanding heavy police bandobast to prevent such an eventuality.
  
 The district in charge minister   on Friday had assured full security to Vijayan who is scheduled to address a communal amity rally at Nehru Maidan later in the evening. He will also participate in a few other private programmes in the city.
  
 The visit has become a political flash point between the Hindu right and the Left over political killings in Kerala, especially Vijayan's home district ever since the Left government came to power in Thiruvananthapuram.
  
 Schools declared holidays in the absence of   citing safety of students.
