HYDERABAD: Senior   leaders including CLP deputy leader T  , former MP V Hanumantha Rao and Tulasi Reddy on Tuesday criticised the TRS-led state government for allowing   chief Pawan Kalyan to tour Telangana and address the public. 

 They lashed out at Pawan Kalyan for praising KCR as a 'smart' and 'hard working' CM and said if everything was fine under TRS rule in Telangana, there is no meaning in Pawan touring the state to understand the problems of the people. 
 
 "If Pawan is so impressed with   and TRS rule, it is better he merges the Jana Sena with TRS," Jeevan Reddy said.
 
 The Congress leaders asked that while leaders like TJAC chairman Professor M Kodandaram is being denied permission to hold meetings and interact with the family members of Telangana martyrs and MRPS leader Manda Krishna Madiga is being jailed for seeking SC categorisation, how can KCR government allow Pawan Kalyan to tour the state.
 
 Hanumantha Rao threw a challenge at Pawan Kalyan to tour Telangana along with him. "Pawan Kalyan compromised with Chandrababu Naidu in   and now has done the same thing with KCR in Telangana," Hanumantha Rao alleged.
 
 In a separate press conference, Mala Mahanadu leaders decided to oppose Pawan kalyan's tour everywhere possible as Pawan had failed to fulfil the promises he made to Dalits during his campaign on behalf of   in 2009.
