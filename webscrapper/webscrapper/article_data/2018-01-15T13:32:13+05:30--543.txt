LUCKNOW: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati attacked the ruling BJP and the Congress on Monday saying the two parties conspired to finish the BSP.

 Mayawati while interacting with journalists said the BJP and the Congress deliberately invoked   to woo Dalits even though they never cared for the community. 
 
 Mayawati said that it was only BSP which followed the principles of Ambedkar to ensure improvement in the lives of poor and downtrodden.
 
 Mayawati said that while Congress forced Ambedkar to resign as the law minister, the BJP did the same by not letting her speak on the issue of Dalit atrocities in Saharanpur.
 
 The former UP chief Minister said the saffron party would have lost Gujarat elections had the state had enough Dalit population. “Ghar Ghar Modi wale Pradesh mein Modi beghar hote bal bal bachey...,” she said.
