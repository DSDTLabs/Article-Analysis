Kanyakumari: Hundreds of people participated in the fourth weekly one-day fast at Mukilankudiyiruppu against the establishing of the international container transhipment terminal (ICTT) at Kanyakumari. Protesters said the village is in the inland and in the scope area that will be affected if the ICTT is established. The pocket is predominantly agrarian.

 The protest, organised by the Kanyakumari International Container Transhipment Terminal Struggle Committee began in the afternoon and concluded late in the evening. Protesters asked the Union and state governments to drop the proposed mega project as it would affect the livelihood of people living in coastal and inland like theirs as well.
 
 Coordinator of the struggle committee, R S Parthasarathy who also hails from the village presided over the protest. “Our village is close to the place where the ICTT is proposed. The mega project on completion will need five lakh litres a day, according to the detailed project report and will be drawn from Valkulam and Thalakulam,” he said.
 
 Parthasarathy added that the two tanks are less than 150m away from the port on one side and about 600m from Mukilankudiyiruppu. “The tanks are the source of drinking water for 13 panchayats. If five lakh litres are drawn from the tanks it will affect water sources of those villages,” he claimed.
 
 He also said that last year the tanks went dry for nine months and the villages suffered from drought. “Our village and nearby villages will be affected throughout the year if water is drawn from the tanks,” he added. Former IAS officer M G Devasahayam was among those who spoke at the protest. Meanwhile on Friday evening the Kumari Thuraimuga Atharavu Iyakkam organised public meetings at a couple of places in the district to create awareness among the public on the need to establish the ICTT in the district.
