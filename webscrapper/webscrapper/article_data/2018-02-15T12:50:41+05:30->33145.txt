GAYA: A   team on a tip-off conducted a raid at   under   police station area of the district on Tuesday evening and recovered nearly 4,000 live   from a dry well.

 The cartridges were neatly packed in a glass container. Cops are said to be looking for weapons in the village and adjoining areas. A villager, living in the vicinity of the abandoned well has been detained for questioning.
 
 The recovery of the huge quantity of cartridges and the possibility of matching weapons kept somewhere else has caused concern in police circles. A past bastion of the Maoists, Konch, for quite sometime now, did not witness any overt Maoist activity, making the anti-Naxal forces somewhat complacent. According to Maoist watchers, the Tuesday evening recovery means the ultras are down but not out from the area, which about two decades back, hit national headlines for execution of limb chopping by the Maoists in their kangaroo courts.
