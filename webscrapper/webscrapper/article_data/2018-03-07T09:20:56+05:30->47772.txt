BHOPAL: Taking exception to Bhopal Memorial Hospital & Research Centreâ€™s ( ) inability to provide treatment and medicines to survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas disaster, the   monitoring committee has decided to write to principal secretary (health & gas relief)  . The committee wants the state government to arrange for their treatment at other hospitals, be it private or government.

 The committee, took note of reports carried by TOI about patients, who were refused treatment at BMHRC due to lack of doctors and medicine crunch leading to 36 registered patients of kidney transplant not getting post-transplant medicines. It said that in place of asking these patients to go to   ( ), Bhopal, the state government should take responsibility for their treatment.
 
 Sources informed that members of the committee felt that in in the absence of any formal tie-up with AIIMS, thrusting additional responsibility of gas disaster survivors on the institute would not be fair. Instead the state government, which is responsible for the medical care of gas disaster survivors by the apex court, should be asked to arrange for their treatment.
 
 The committee also decided to probe the BMHRC director about medicine crunch and veracity of media reports that kidney transplant patients were not being provided medicines by the hospital.
 
 The committee also felt that some kind of tie-up with AIIMS would strengthen BMHRC cater to gas disaster survivors better at least till the time that   (UPSC) initiates procedure to recruit doctors according to new recruitment rules framed for BMHRC.
