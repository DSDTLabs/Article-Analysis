VASCO: The public works department, following a TOI report, has finally begun constructing a   near the newly-built road for heavy vehicles to enter   premises, in Vasco. Earlier, there was hardly any space between the road and the compound wall of Vasco fire station, leaving no room for flow of monsoon water. 

 On February 17, TOI had reported the loopholes in constructing the new entry road to GSL. PWD junior engineer   said that “it was a technical point raised by your paper and as part of our routine inspection, we decided to built this nullah”.
 
 The nullah would be 40cm deep at the start of the road near Vasco fire station and will get deeper (50cm) towards the end, to facilitate smooth flow of water. This road is specially built to prevent the bottleneck formation of traffic at GSL gate.
 
 Constructing the nullah has also solved another problem. As the new road for heavy vehicles was touching the compound wall, some sources claimed that the wall may not be able to sustain the vibrations of the heavy loaded vehicles. The nullah now creates a breathing space between the road and the compound wall. 
 
 Officials from the fire station had written a letter to the PWD roads section, three months ago, expressing concern about blocked holes in the compound wall. “There were four holes created in the compound wall. Without the holes, the entire compound would flood during the rainy season, hindering the partking of fire tenders. The accumulated water also enters the staff quarters,” fire station officials had stated in their complaint. Despite having holes in the compound, the water would recede very slowly, and now with the holes blocked, the officials at the Vasco fire station are worried about facing the monsoon.
