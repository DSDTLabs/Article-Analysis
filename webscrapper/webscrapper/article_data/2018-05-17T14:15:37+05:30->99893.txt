PATNA: As   begins on Thursday, city doctors have advised devotees to be cautious while observing fast during the holy month.

 According to Imarat Shariah sources, the moon was sighted on Wednesday evening.
 
 According to physician Dr  , people partaking in the fast should keep themselves hydrated as Ramzan has fallen in the peak of the summer season this year. “They should consume juicy fruits that have high water content and at least three litres of liquid. Spicy and fried food items should be avoided as they may lead to acidity,” he said on Wednesday and added people should avoid overexposure to heat.
 
 Diabetologist Dr   advised diabetics not to keep fast. He said, “Diabetics should avoid oily food as well as anything that has high sugar content. They should consult a doctor before making any changes in their normal dose of medicines.”
 
 Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences’ assistant professor Dr Amresh Krishna asked patients, who have recently undergone dialysis, kidney transplant or are afflicted with severe chronic kidney diseases (stages 3 to 5), not to observe fast.
 
 “Such patients should avoid potassium-rich diet such as dates and bananas. Patients with mild and moderate chronic kidney diseases should avoid drinking a lot of fluid at once. Besides, those suffering from stone diseases should keep themselves hydrated and avoid non-vegetarian food,” Dr Krishna said.
