LUCKNOW: Even as UP CM   and PM Modi spar over the   run in city,   Rail Corporation (LMRC) would run the train till   for the first time on Thursday afternoon. Also for the first time, trials would be done at the maximum designed speed of 90 kmph on the complete 8.5 km priority section from Transport Nagar to Charbagh on Thursday.

 An LMRC official confirmed to TOI, “This decision has been taken to be prepared before RDSO’s inspection from February 20. The RDSO team would test Metro on various parameters, most important being oscillation trials. For that, we have to test the train at maximum speed and on the complete 8.5 km track.”
 
 Therefore, for the first time, Lucknowites would be able to see live run of Metro from track’s end to end on Kanpur Road. 
 
 Incidentally, RDSO gave its approval for 90 kmph maximum designed speed just a day ago. Until now, the train has been conducting trials up to 60 kmph only, that too on less than 6.5 km track till the   station. Since LMRC finished laying of one side track on Mawaiya’s special cantilever span on Wednesday, the officials decided to take the train ahead of Mawaiya, up to Charbagh. 
 
 LMRC claims Mawaiya’s special span to be the country’s longest span over railway tracks. The 225-metre-long span is constructed above 15 railway tracks, of which 12 are functional and three are proposed in future. The cantilever span has been built in a record time of 16 months at a 22 metre height from road level. The span consists of 105-metre-long central span above railway track while 75 metre connecting spans on each side of the road. 
 
 LMRC has already constructed tracks till Durgapuri and Charbagh, beyond Mawaiya. Officials said, “The other side track on Mawaiya’s span would be laid in the next two days after which the train would be able to commute on both side tracks.”
