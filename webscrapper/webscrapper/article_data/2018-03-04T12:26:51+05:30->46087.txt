PUNE: The Market Yard police have arrested two   and booked a woman, also a domestic help, for their involvement in stealing gold ornaments worth Rs 22.60 lakh from the residence of owners of Ranka Jewellers. 

 The theft took place at Vardhamanpura housing society in Gultekdi some time between February 28 and March 1.
 
 The two arrested —   (32) and Prakash Gujar (20) — have been remanded in police custody till March 6. Jyotsna Ranka (45) had lodged an FIR about the theft under sections 381 (theft by servant) of the Indian Penal Code. 
 
 Senior inspector   said, “Ranka had shifted the ornaments from their shop’s locker to a cupboard in their house on February 28. She found the ornaments missing when she opened the cupboard the next day to wear them for a marriage ceremony. She searched the cupboard and her house thoroughly but could not find them.”
 
 Shinde said, “Ranka has stated in her complaint that she suspected the involvement of Paswan and Gujar, and the woman domestic help, whose name has been withheld, in the theft because the cupboard’s and the flat’s locks were intact. Also, nobody else had visited their house during the period.” 
 
 “We have arrested Paswan and Gujar and are interrogating them to find out the whereabouts of the ornaments. The missing ornaments include three gold and diamond necklaces and two earrings,” Shinde said.
 
 Ranka told TOI over the phone, “We own two flats, 801 and 806, in ‘C’ building of the housing society. I informed my husband as soon as I realised that the ornaments had been stolen. When my husband questioned the domestic help about the missing ornaments, they denied committing any theft. I am suspecting them because they have a set of the flat’s keys. They work in the house when we go out.” 
 
 Sub-inspector   of the Market Yard police is investigating the case.
