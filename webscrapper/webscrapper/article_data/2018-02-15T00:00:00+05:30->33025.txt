Actress Sruthi Hariharan’s next film is Nathicharami, which will be directed by   of   fame. This film now has music composer  , who scored music for  , on board.   is the wife of singer-composer  . 
“When working on the script for the film, Mansore was sure that the music had to be different. It needed a lot of melody, as well as a little bit of quirk in it. I’d just seen Aruvi around then and I had Bindu’s name at the back of my mind, because she possesses the same quirky style that we needed. We were initially sceptical about asking her, given that she’d just landed such a big break with Aruvi. But to our happiness she said yes almost immediately. Her music has a lot of quirky beats and sounds, which is going to be interesting and new in Kannada. We saw a breath of fresh air when   composed some different music for Godhi Banna Sadharana Mykattu, which had people raving about it and saying how it changed the Kannada film music scene. We’re hoping for something similar with Bindu’s music,” says Sruthi. 
 There’s another reason the team is glad to have Bindu work with them. “Having a woman composer on board is like the cherry on the cake, because the film has a strong female protagonist. It looks at how society perceives a ‘single’ woman. So, having another female perspective on the team was great for us,” adds Sruthi. 
 The team is currently on recee for the film, which is expected to go on floors by March 1. The cast of this film includes Balaji Manohar, Vikas,   and Shweta Srinivas.
