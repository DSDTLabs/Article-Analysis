BATHINDA: Irked over spiralling petroleum prices over the last 12 days, farmers’ organisations are burning effigies depicting the Union government.   party workers burnt effigies depicting   government on Friday and demanded immediate roll-back of prices. 

 Activists of the farmers’ organisation, BKU Ekta Ugrahan burnt effigies at Fatehgarh Channa village and Dhaula on Friday and said they would continue the protests. Members of BKU   have decided to burn Union government effigies in villages from May 27 to June 2.
 
 BJU Dakonda president Buta Singh Burjgill said, “paddy sowing season is about to start and farmers are already midway through planting nursery for paddy. They are forced to shell out more due to hike in prices of diesel, which will increase input cost in sowing paddy. Farmers are already reeling under hard economic conditions and are not in a position to shell out more. The government should arrest the trend of hike in prices of petroleum prices”.
 
  members Ashok Kumar and Arun Wadhawan said price hike in petroleum products is causing huge loss to the common man. Accusing the Union government of robbing people, they asked if this is their idea of “acche din.”
