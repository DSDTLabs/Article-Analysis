COIMBATORE: The   formed by the district administration to inspect whether schools follow the 25% RTE reservation and also the community-wise reservation held a meeting on Tuesday,  

 The administration will ensure that the reservation norms are followed properly, district Adi-Dravidar welfare officer   said. “We will also conduct visits to schools after they make admissions for Class XI and ensure that the reservation norms are followed,” he told TOI.
 
 State secretary of Tamizhaga Dalit Peoples Association S  , who had petitioned the district administration for an inspection committee, said they would identify schools that had flouted the reservation norms last year and would inspect those schools. “We have come to know that some schools have pasted notices saying that they would admit only those who score more than 450 marks in Class X. This is a clear violation of the reservation norms,” he said.
 
 Selvakumar said the schools have to maintain a ledger mentioning the seats given under RTE and also the community-wise reservation quota. “If a student has scored well, he or she should be admitted under the open category, or else the student should be admitted according to the quota norms,” he said.
 
 Inspector of matriculation schools R   said the department too will form a team and inspect the matriculation schools to verify whether the schools had followed the norms. “We would select the schools based on the last year’s report that shows which schools had not followed the reservation norms. If they had not followed it, we would intervene and make them conduct admissions based on the reservation norms,” she said.
