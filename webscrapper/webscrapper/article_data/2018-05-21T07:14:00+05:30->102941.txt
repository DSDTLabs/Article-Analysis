NOIDA: A 25-year-old man having alleged links with the   gang was arrested after a chase and gunfight with police in   late on Sunday evening.

 The accused was identified as Manish, a resident of Chipiyana village in Greater Noida. Police said they were conducting a routine check near the Sirsa Roundabout area around 9pm when Manish and an accomplice came on a bike. “The police team signalled them to stop. But they opened fire at the cops and tried to speed away,” said Ajay Pal Sharma, SSP, Gautam Budh Nagar.
 
 The police team chased the duo and opened fire, hitting Manish in the right leg. While Manish fell off the bike and was apprehended, his accomplice riding pillion managed to escape in the dark.
 
 Sharma said Manish had links with Chhota Shakeel and was a member of the gang that had been given the contract to kill Chakrapani Maharaj, who claims allegiance to the Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha.   had bought underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s car for Rs 32,000 at an auction in Mumbai in 2015 and burnt it in  .
 
 According to sources, the gang had taken Rs 5 lakh to eliminate Maharaj but failed to carry out the murder as four of its members, including Manish, were arrested in Delhi. They were later released on bail and resumed their criminal activities in NCR.
 
 Manish was wanted in 11 criminal cases registered in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida. Dharmendra  , the Greater Noida police station in-charge, said the accused had been taken to the district hospital for a medical examination.
 
 “The accused will be questioned about his criminal activities. He will be produced in court once he is discharged from hospital,” Kumar said.
