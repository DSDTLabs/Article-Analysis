Tennis ace   made her first appearance on   last Sunday (February 5). The show saw Sania open up about various aspects of her life and she did make some interesting revelations on the show.
 
 When it came to her boyfriends before marriage, Karan slyly mentioned reports of her being with the 'Rangoon' star Shahid Kapoor, but Sania refuted all the rumours blatantly. However, not the one to keep quiet, Farah further added to her answer by saying that people begin to lie when they get on the couch. 
  
 
 
 
 
 While playing the Rapid Fire round, Sania chose to kill Shahid Kapoor and went on to say that she'd marry and hook up with Ranveer Singh. The tennis star made it quite evident that Salman and Ranveer were her current favourites. 
  
 Talking about why she had not graced the coffee couch before, Sania disclosed that  , the host of the chat show, had actually called her seven years ago with a cricketer. But back then her father was reluctant about sending her to the show. He asked Sania not to appear on the show due to its scandalous and controversial nature. 
  
 Next up, the show will see the cast of 'Badrinath Ki Dulhaniya' - Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan. Both of them have earlier appeared on the Koffee with Karan Season 5, but separately. Going by the promo, it seems the next episode would be worth all the wait.
