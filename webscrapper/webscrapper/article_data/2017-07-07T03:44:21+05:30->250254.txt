NEW DELHI/PATNA: Opposition parties will meet on July 11 to discuss the candidate for vice-president's election, an exercise that will again test the cohesion in the anti-BJP axis after JD(U) chief   supported the NDA nominee for president. 

  Congress's   said JD(U) would attend the meeting. But waters remain muddled as JD(U) made it clear it had not made up its mind on its support. "The party had taken no decision yet on the vice-president's election. There has been no discussion in the party so far," JD(U) general secretary   said. He pointed out that JD(U)'s alliance with   and RJD was currently restricted to  . 
 
  Calling JD(U) an ally, Azad said Nitish Kumar was CM of Congress as well as RJD, as he sought to placate the Bihar leader who he had criticised for not acting on principles. Kumar's unapologetic response had seen Congress desist from fresh provocation. Azad reasoned that JD(U) had criticised the delay in finalising the candidate for the president's post - a reason advanced for supporting NDA - and so the opposition decided to call an early meeting for the VP's election. 
 
  The decision that JD(U) takes on the upcoming contest will be crucial in deciding the seriousness of the opposition's challenge. 
 
  Congress has begun wooing Kumar by calling him a staunch ally and declaring the issue as over. Sources claimed   was keen on meeting Nitish and is learned to have asked Bihar unit chief Ashok Choudhary, who met him in Delhi on Tuesday, to prevent further mudslinging. He also warned of action against workers berating the Bihar CM. 
 
  Congress said the main agenda of the July 11 meeting might go beyond V-P's election and involve a discussion on farmers' protest and lynching. Kumar had said that opposition should stop being reactive and carve out an alternative narrative to take on BJP.
