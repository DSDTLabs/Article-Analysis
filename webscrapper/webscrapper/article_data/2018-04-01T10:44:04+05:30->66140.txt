NAGPUR: Following poor response of ridership in Green buses,   is set to reduce bus fares of ethanol run air-conditioned buses from next week. “The NMC will reduce the fares by Rs3 to Rs4 on all routes,” confirmed NMC’s transport committee chairman  . Referring to a transport committee nod to reduce the fare, a senior officer from the transport department explained the fare will be reduced on experimental basis. 

 TOI had recently reported that the 25 eco-friendly air-conditioned buses plying on 14 different routes were running almost empty for most part of the day. Taking cognisance of TOI report, even union transport minister   directed the NMC to reduce the fare immediately.
 
 The officer said the revised green bus fares will be implemented either from April 5 or 6. “The NMC, however, will not revise the fares of red buses though the transport panel headed by chairman Bunty Kukde gave its nod,” the officer said. To a query, he said the fares are being reduced on experimental basis
 
 The ridership reports of the three months from November 2017 to January 2018 of the green buses accessed by TOI too had shown that the target was far from being achieved. Despite offering a comfortable ride, these buses were getting a ridership of less than .83% of the 1.64 crore passengers who travelled in city buses. Only 1,36,709 commuters used the service in three months while the 25 buses made 14,797 trips.
