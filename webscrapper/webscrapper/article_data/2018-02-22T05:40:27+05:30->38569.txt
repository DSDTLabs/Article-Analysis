MUMBAI: The state plastic manufacturers’ association has announced a morcha at   on Friday over a likely ban on their products within a month.

 Manufacturers call the ban unreasonable and an easy way out for the government over long-term measures such as prevention of littering and ensuring 100% recycling of plastic products.
 
 Ravi  , president,  , said over 10,000 participants are expected at the protest at Azad Maidan. “There are stringent rules on plastic waste management which already put the onus of managing waste on manufacturers, but rather than implementing these, the government has taken this extreme step,” he said.
 
 He said the ban would not be successful, just like the ban on plastic products with thickness under 50 microns.
 
 “The tea chaiwalas serve in   is in cups under 50 microns in thickness,” Jashnani said.
 
 Manufacturers said the ban may not be effective because of expensive and limited plastic alternatives. “For paper more tree-cutting will be required; fabric will prove to be the costlier alternative,” Jashnani said. He said that over 90% of plastic bottles are re-used and over 60% of plastic is re-processed.
