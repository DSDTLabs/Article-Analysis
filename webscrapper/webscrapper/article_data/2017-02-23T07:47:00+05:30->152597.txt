GURUGRAM: A few days after learning about the illegal felling of hundreds of trees at   village in Sector 111, the forest department on Wednesday confirmed, in a preliminary report, that   trees were felled till February 18. 

 The report, prepared by a committee of range officers appointed to probe the case, confirmed that 716 trees were cut, excluding trees that fall under the ‘exempted’ category. A showcause notice has already been served to the developer, who allegedly had the trees   to clear the land for a real estate project.
 
 “We have already served notice to the real estate firm and suspended the forest guard and a forester. We’ve also recommended action against the concerned range officer,” said M D  , conservator of forests.
 
 Green activists demanded criminal charges against the developer for felling so many trees. “Mindless cutting of trees took place in Chauma village. Losing one tree in a city like Gurgaon causes a big damage to the environment. We demand criminal charges against the developer so that it acts as a deterrent for others who cut trees for their selfish motives,” said  , a city-based environmentalist. 
 
 “This case reflects major negligence on part of the forest department, as no FIR has been registered so far. They had issued permission to transplant 20 trees, but never bothered to visit the area on inspection. The permission granted by the department doesn’t specify the exact area where permission for tree felling was granted. These are loopholes that provide opportunity to real estate developers to carry out such offence,” alleged   of NGO Haryali.
