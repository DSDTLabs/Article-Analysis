GHAZIABAD: A fake 2,000-rupee note surfaced in   on Thursday barely five months after the notes of this denomination were released across the country by the RBI. An ATM of Punjab National Bank (PNB) in   dispensed the fake note when a local resident, Harish Bhardwaj (32), was withdrawing cash from it.

 Bhardwaj, a resident of B Block in Sector 23 of Sanjay Nagar, had gone to the ATM to withdraw Rs 20,000 from his savings account. He withdrew the money in two transactions of Rs 10,000 each. The ATM dispensed five units of 2,000-rupee notes in each transaction. According to Bhardwaj, one of the five notes dispensed by the machine in the second transaction seemed to be fake because there were different colours on each side of it.
 
 Harish’s father, Radhe Shyam Sharma, a retired HR manager with Mother Dairy, contacted the bank’s circle office after seeing the fake note. However, the bank has refused to own up responsibility for the fake note.
 
 The circle office of PNB, which oversees managements of all its branches across Noida, Greater Noida and Ghaziabad, has advised Sharma to submit a complaint letter in the Sanjay Nagar branch along with a photocopy of the fake note and its transaction slip.
 
 S K Agarwal, senior manager, PNB circle office, said it was not clear from where the customer received the fake currency note. “That’s why we have asked him to register a formal complaint. Currency notes are not deposited inside ATMs by banks. Vendors and other agencies are hired to deposit cash into ATM machines. We will enquire from the outer agency deployed with the Sanjay Nagar branch in particular to ascertain the source of the fake note. Further investigation will be conducted if we are not able to establish the source of this fake note from the outer agency,” Agarwal said.
