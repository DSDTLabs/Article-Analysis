ISLAMABAD: The Lahore high court on Thursday warned the government against "harassment" of LeT founder and alleged Mumbai terror attacks mastermind   and ordered authorities to not disrupt his "social" activities till the next hearing.

 
 The decision comes two days after the US designated Saeed's newly founded political party,  , as a terrorist organisation.
 
 Saeed had filed a petition earlier this year, seeking the court's direction to restrain the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government from arresting him and acting against his organisations,   and Falah-i-Insaniat Foundation, which have been banned by both the US and the UN. In his petition, Saeed alleged that the government was interfering in his party's welfare projects under duress from India and the  .
 
 On Thursday, Saeed's counsel AK Dogar requested the court for a full bench hearing since the case was of a "sensitive nature". Justice Ameenud Din Khan, the same judge who had ordered the federal and Punjab governments last month not to arrest or place Saeed under house arrest, said the court will take a decision on the request in the next hearing.
 
 The judge also directed the authorities to submit their responses on the JuD leader's petition by April 23 and allow him to continue his "welfare activities till the next hearing.
