Krishnagiri: A piece of land that belongs to the HR&CE-run Sri Sankara Narayana Swamy temple in Hosur, Krishnagiri district, has been encroached upon and two   there. The   Thasildar has confirmed that the shops are built on temple land as per records.

 Founder-president of the Tiruthoundargal Sabai A Radhakrishnan alleged that a man constructed the shops about 15 years ago. “Those shops have been let out, but this information is not mentioned in the temple records,” he said.
 
 One K R Radhakrishnan of Hosur has been using the shops to stock rice bags for more than five years.
 
 A Radhakrishnan said the encroachers had demolished a portion of the temple to construct the structure without getting consent from HR&CE officials.
 
 However, the rice go-down owner K R Radhakrishnan said HR&CE officials very well knew about the shops. “I used to give the rent to a person who approached me. I don’t know who he is and where he is from,” he said.
 
 Vignesh Sharma, son of the temple priest, said the shops were constructed after getting consent from HR&CE officials. Asked about the consent letter obtained from the department, he said he did not have it.
 
 When contacted by TOI, executive officer of the temple P Rajarathinam said he did not know about the illegal construction. The HR&CE was receiving Rs 665 as rent from the shop owner. “My predecessors allowed the construction and I do not know whether it is illegal or not,” he said. He said he had sent a letter to the shop owner asking him to increase the rent at least to Rs.4,000.
 
 Hosur thasildar V Bandarinathan confirmed that both shops were constructed on the temple land as per records. “I have sent a report to the Salem joint commissioner of HR&CE T Varadharajan to initiate departmental inquiry in this issue,” he said. He also directed the joint commissioner to send his report to the Krishnagiri district administration on or before April 28.
