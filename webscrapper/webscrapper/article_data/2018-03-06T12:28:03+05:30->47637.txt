TRICHY: Most of the private city   coming from the   bus stand frequently skip the railway junction bus stop during peak hours to avoid running into traffic congestion on the stretch. 

 These buses virtually get filled at the central bus stand itself. Hence, they head towards the head post office by avoiding the railway junction bus stop and proceeding through  , even though movement of heavy vehicles is banned on this road. 
 
 During peak hours, the commuters waiting at the junction bus stop have to wait for several minutes to board a city bus, which are mostly government fleets, or should walk all the way till the Central bus stand to board one.
 
 Besides causing inconvenience for commuters, reckless driving by private city buses is also a threat for other commuters accessing McDonalds Road near the SBI main branch. 
 
 C  , honourary president of Exnora, said, “Private city buses, instead of passing through the junction, take a detour and reach   via SBI main branch to avoid the crowd waiting for buses in front of the railway junction.” 
 
 A few years ago, the barrier set at the McDonalds Road stretch to prevent entry of heavy vehicles on the stretch was removed following which city buses including trucks have started plying on the narrow stretch.
 
 Locals have sought a barrier to be set up again to prevent city buses skipping the bus stop at the railway junction. However, traffic police sources that it was most unlikely to be established. 
 
 Police sources said that they would ensure that buses are redirected to reach the Bharathiyar Salai only via the railway junction bus stop..
