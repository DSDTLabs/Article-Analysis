COIMBATORE: Former transport minister   has requested the state government to withdraw the bus fare hike immediately. Speaking to reporters at the city airport, he said this would affect nearly two crore passengers, who daily commute to work and other purposes.

 Pointing out that the condition of state’s industrial sectors was already pathetic, the supporter of   said the bus fare hike has come at the wrong time. “Transport department should be service oriented like educational and public health departments. The state government is allotting enough funds to highways department and public works department, but it failed to allocate funds to transport department,” Senthil Balaji said.
 
 “People cannot bear the additional burden. But Edappadi Palaniswami’s government is giving additional burden to the common people of the state. And it shows the failure of the state government to take care of its people. The government is operated by someone. The bus fare hike should be withdrawn immediately,” he added.
 
 Municipal administration minister SP  , meanwhile, said the government was forced to increase the bus fare to provide the employees of   ( ) their pending dues.
 
 Velumani blamed the previous DMK government for accumulating pending amounts in TNSTC department. “The   government is hiking the bus fare to provide the pending amount to the TNSTC employees,” he said.
 
 “During the DMK regime, the TNSTC employee’s funds were misused for other schemes. So, the government is not able to provide them retirement benefits. We increased the bus fare, but it is still lower than the fare in other states,” he said. tnn
