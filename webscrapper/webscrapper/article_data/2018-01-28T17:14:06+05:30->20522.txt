 Piven has denied the fresh set of allegations.

 "As evidenced by the lie detector test I took and passed, I have never forced myself on anyone, nor have I ever exposed myself or restrained anyone against their will. To the contrary, if any woman ever said no, I stopped," he added. 
 
 Piven had denied the allegations that surfaced against him in November last year, calling them 'absolutely false and completely fabricated'.
