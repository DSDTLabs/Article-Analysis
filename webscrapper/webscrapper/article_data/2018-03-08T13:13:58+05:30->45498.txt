On March 8, 2017, there was a call for all women to wear red. In a social media fuelled movement, women kitted out in red as a response to the ‘Day Without a Woman’ movement. But why red? Why not purple, green or white (the original  )? Because red is the colour of power and action. It can’t be missed. A reason why,   has been vilified. 

  
 
  Everyone has their own take on the red  . For lipstick entrepreneur Poppy King, red lipstick is a source of strength. She feels that the moment you put it on, you feel more capable than you did without it.   doyenne Shahnaz Husain says “Red is a colour that is associated with wild romance, femininity, power, freewheeling fun and a million other emotions. Tones of red glamorously capture the thrill of a woman’s emotional extremes. It adds a hint of sexy to your look.”
 
  In the 1500s, English pastors tried to denounce lip painting as the “devil’s work.” But that didn’t stop Queen Elizabeth I from using a mixture of cochineal, gum Arabic, egg white and fig milk to paint her lips crimson. According to fashionista.com, in 1700, the British government finally passed a law that formally condemned lipstick on the basis that “women found guilty of seducing men into matrimony by cosmetic means could be tried for witchcraft.” Credit goes to the  , with its Technicolor films, that red lipstick became acceptable. Marilyn Monroe’s red pout in the 1950s was the sign of overtly feminine power.

  Inherent sexiness of the colour red is why it’s shunned for work wear. But celebrity makeup artists Uday Shirali says that applying red lipstick is empowering. “By dressing your lips in red, you draw people’s attention towards yourself – especially your mouth, and subsequently, the words that come out of it,” he says.
