For the first time the   reality programme  , will have a disc jockey music on their show with  . The contestants who have till now only been singing to live music will get a completely different feel with the club and jazz music that Akbar will bring to the show. 

 With around three decades of being in the Bollywood music industry and producing music for many songs, Akbar has indeed come a long way and this experience showcases itself in his work. Talking about his TV debut he says, “I have designed the music and made the sound tracks of all the different segments. The entire feel and sound of the show will be altered completely. Indian Idol will have a new feel and sound. I will also be introducing each of the contestants before their performance.” 
 
 The DJ was astounded by the sheer talent of the singers on the show but he felt that the DJs in our country have not yet made a mark for themselves like it is common with DJs abroad. He states, “This is the first time that a DJ has got such a fantastic platform. No one really knows how many years of hard work, dedication and knowledge of the craft is needed to be a DJ and just prefixing your name with these initials does not make you one.”
