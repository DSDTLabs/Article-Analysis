 “At 7.15am, we got a call about the elephant having fainted in the village. Luckily, we were already in the field and I rushed with doctors to the spot by 7.45am,“ said K Shivaram, range forest officer (RFO) Sangam range.
 
 On examining the animal, the veterinarian suspected it may have fainted as it hadn't got sufficient water. Shivaram said the elephant might have come out of the forest and reached the village on Wednesday night. “I think it came in search of food, but by morning it lost all energy without water,“ he said, adding that the elephant was still moving its limbs and trunk when they first arrived at the spot.
 
 As its condition deteriorated, veterinarians from the Bannerghatta range arrived and even took a blood sample, which is being examined. “Before we could get the test results and ascertain what exactly went wrong with the animal, it died sometime between 4.30pm and 4.45pm,“ said Shivaram.
 
 He said there were no signs of the elephant belonging to any herd in the vicin ity. He was travelling alone.
 
 It was a makna -a bull (male elephant) without tusks. As of Thursday evening, forest officials maintained that the jumbo died due to dehydration. However, they are still waiting for lab results to confirm the same.
 
 “Anticipating a harsh summer, we had begun digging ponds and wells in several parts from as early as October,“ said Shivaram. He said ponds have been dug up in Madivala, Bandegudu, Shivapuradoddi and Mugguru, among other places. “The problem is that we cannot do this deep inside the forest; it can only be done in areas where there are borewells or tankers can reach to refill ponds,“ he added.
