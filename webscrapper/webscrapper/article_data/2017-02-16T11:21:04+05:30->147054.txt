NAGPUR: A couple of months ago, before campaigning started for the NMC elections, there was speculation that   will be a big gainer of the prabhag system as it was a cadre-based party. There were many who believed BSP would leave the Congress behind.

 On February 3, the last date for filing nomination papers for the  , the situation seems reversed.   messed up the  . 
 
 There is so much unrest within the party that the projection of over 40 seats has gone for a toss. Loyal members were denied ticket while outsiders were preferred.There are doubts if the party would be able to retain its 2012 number of 12 corporators.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  Do not make the mistake of writing off BSP. It happens in every election and every time our candidates bag sizable votes. In 2012, BSP won 12 seats and in 13 places we were Number 2. So, this time we should win at least 25 seats.
 
  Anger among party workers is quite visible. Party leaders handling ticket distribution have been accused of selling nomination for a price...
 
  Such allegations are made all the time. Tell me one political party that is not facing the problem of disgruntlement of those denied ticket. In politics, we have to live with this. Now the dust has settled and all grassroots workers have got involved in party campaign.
 
 
 
  Itâ€™s true some loyal, hardworking aspirants were let down. But the leadership may have considered all factors before allotting tickets. In the new system, new factors have been considered. 
 
 This may serve the purpose of winning more seats.
