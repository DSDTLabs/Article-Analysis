NEW DELHI: The   on Friday made it clear that it asked the police to consider a   as an option because other leads to trace the missing   student   have not borne fruit.

 “The student went missing in October (2016), it is February now. Nearly four months have gone by and none of the leads are going anywhere. We asked for the test as the other leads have not yielded any results,” a bench of Justices G S Sistani and Vinod Goel said.
 
 The bench was hearing an application by one of the nine students, who are suspects in the case, seeking recall of the high court’s December 14 and December 22, 2016 orders on this aspect.
 
 The student claimed that by these two orders the court was regulating the manner of investigation and it may result in violation of the suspect’s rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution.
