LUCKNOW: Travellers in the city will now only need to swipe a card to get railway ticket as   has decided to install cashless Cash Operated Automatic   (COATVMs) at   by end of March. Speaking to TOI, daily travellers said, it would be great for them because they usually carry minimum cash with them.

 Around six COATVMs will be installed in the second booking hall of the railway station. To use the machine, passenger will need to procure the smart card from counter number five and can recharge it as per usage, from Rs 10-5,000. The machine will dole only unreserved tickets, though there is no limit of travel. Passengers can also get platform tickets by swiping the card.
 
 Working with a multi-national company, Mahesh Singh, who has to travel daily between Kanpur and Lucknow some times to Bareilly said, “I lose one hour daily in queue for ticket and this is good news for me as I can save time and go cashless,” added Mahesh.
 
 Marketing manager of a private firm Smriti, who has to travel every alternate day to new destinations said, “There are ATVMs at Charbagh which demand cash for every ticket and passenger often face technical errors but swipe card a better option.” 
 
 Seventy-seven-year-old Gurpreet Kaur who was standing in a queue for a platform ticket said, every year railway comes up with something good for senior citizens but their employees never pay attention so the benefit is rendered worthless within six months. According to divisional commercial manager M L Meena, the smart card will be valid for six months and if passenger does not use it within given time, the balance amount will lapse. Also, railways has appointed two supervisors for day and night shifts to take care of the machine in case of technical error.
