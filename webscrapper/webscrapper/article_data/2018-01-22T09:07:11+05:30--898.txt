Streamlining garbage collection, decentralizing the waste processing system and treating apartment complexes on par with independent houses were among the issues discussed at the event. One key demand of residents was to process collected waste within the same ward.

 Appealing for the closure of the Karnataka Compost Development Corporation plant in Kudlu, Lalithamba BV, a resident of HSR Layout in   assembly constituency, said “The stink from the plant is absolutely unbearable. Why is waste from 15 other wards being processed in my ward? The whole process must be decentralized so that waste from each ward is processed within that ward itself.”
 
 Prasanna Kumar, who lives close to  , said waste collection efforts must be stepped up. “For maximum efficiency, waste must be collected once in the morning and once in the evening,” he said. “Also, waste processing units should be right next to BBMP ward offices. Only then will they treat the issue seriously.”
 
 Residents also wanted the Palike to provide safety-gear for pourakarmikas, install bins throughout the city, stringently implement the plastic-ban and make it mandatory for foodvendors to have two bins (one for dry waste and one for wet) in front of their stalls.
 
 G Kumar wanted the Palike to set up composting plants in apartment complexes, while citizens also urged the Palike to remove encroachments from lakes, and ensure that untreated sewage does not flow into them and pollute them.
 
 What they suggest
 
 • Decentralise waste processing plants
 
 • Ensure timely collection of waste from households
 
 • Remove encroachments from lakes
 
 • Stop pourkarmikas from running around for biometric attendance
 
 • Make apartments active partners in solid waste management
 
 • Install coloured garbage bins for wet, dry and other waste at strategic locations
