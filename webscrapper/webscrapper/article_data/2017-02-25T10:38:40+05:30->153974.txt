BHOPAL: In one of the biggest action against mining mafia, more than 200 trucks have been seized by the administration in Panna in the last two days.

 In all more than 300 trucks were seized in a campaign against the mafia in the last one month. However, truck operators alleged that even the trucks operating legally were also seized. The trucks were confiscated from different parts of the district bordering Uttar Pradesh. Panna district collector Irene Cynthia told TOI, “The trucks were seized from our jurisdiction, but 55 of them are still parked in UP. We have penalised the truck operators. After we came to know that the trucks belong to a particular contractor a notice was issued to him.”
 
 In a surprise move on Thursday, teams of district administration comprising police officials, revenue and mining department personnel among others raided the mining areas of sand, stone and other minerals. Majority of the trucks that were confiscated were overloaded with sand, which is much in demand. Many of them cross the border from Uttar Pradesh to load the heavy vehicle. About 1 month back, 138 trucks were seized. They also included trucks carrying sand and stones.
 
 On January 23, after cracking a whip on sand mafia, two temporary bridges, about 50 metres in length, were also demolished. One of them was built at Nehra village on a shallow part of Ken river to facilitate the transportation of illegally mined sand. It was made of iron pipes, clay and wooden logs, said the district administration officials. Cynthia said the action against the sand mafia would continue. Sources in the state secretariat claimed that the state government has “given free hand” to district collectors to initiate action against the sand mafia. This is likely to continue till the Narmada Seva Yatra is on, as the government has been facing criticism over   in Narmada river.
