BETTIAH: West Champaran district judge   has ordered a judicial inquiry into the murder of undertrial prisoner and dreaded gangster   on the Bettiah court premises on Thursday.
 
  Sources said on the directive of the district judge, CJM Jairam Prasad has entrusted the probe to Bettiah SDJM Manoranjan Jha. The probe shall focus on the security arrangements while production of undertrials in court.
  
  Incidentally, it was the second killing of an undertrial prisoner on the Bettiah court premises in five years. In June 2012, notorious criminal Babban Ram was killed. While assailants shot Bablu dead in the open by melting into the crowd of litigants and lawyers, Babban was killed by another jail inmate Yasin Khan while whiling away his time before his production in court by playing cards in the court hazat (lock-up). Khan also had been brought for production in the court. Khan had procured a countrymade pistol to commit the crime. Bablu’s assailants also used small weapons. “They fired from countrymade pistols,” Bettiah SP   told newsmen.
  
  Zonal IG Sunil Kumar has also instituted a probe. Tirhut Range DIG Anil Kumar Singh, holding additional charge of Champaran police range, said, “I’m probing the incident. If any negligence in security is found out, the guilty will be punished. We are also looking into ways to bolster safety of the court premises.”
  
  Bettiah SP Vinay Kumar said on Friday, “The gang has been identified. We have found clues.”
  
  A couple of years before Babban’s killing, another dreaded criminal and undertrial,  , was fired upon by a fellow jail inmate on the court premises itself. The countrymade pistol misfired, saving Thakur’s life. In 1999, Prem Kumar, a district court ‘peshkar’ (clerk) was shot dead just outside the court premises here.
