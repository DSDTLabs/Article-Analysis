From the way it’s made, to the concept and the name — everything about   seems out of the ordinary. Equally interesting is the story behind how director   came up with concept of the film. “I spent a lot of time in the forests of   for an earlier production. Once, when I was travelling from   to  , there was a boy who was collecting money at a check post. The boy kept staring at the sunglasses that was hanging from my T-shirt. I asked him what his name was and the way he said ‘Suresha’ stayed with me for a long time. I thought about who he is and what his story might be. He was probably from the woods and had no idea about civilization. While developing the idea of Huliraaya, I thought about this incident. Also, if you notice on the ring roads of Bengaluru, you will find people from other parts of the state who go there to make a living. They don’t know anything about the city, so, how do they react? These two ideas correlated and that’s when the journey of Huliraaya began.”

  
  
 
 Quiz him on how he came about the name of the movie and Aravind reveals that the idea for that came from a zoo. “When people go to a zoo, they get excited when they see tigers behind a cage; they comment, laugh and click pictures. I thought about what that might seem like from the tiger’s perspective — how would the tiger feel? He might want to pounce on everyone, but he can’t do that since he’s in a cage. Similarly, all of us are confined to a certain belief system, wherein we are all trying to impress someone or be a certain way. In that way, there is a caged tiger inside each one of us. And that’s why the film is called Huliraaya,” says Aravind.
