PATNA: Elaborate security arrangements have been made for the   as 242 MLAs in the 243-member   would cast their votes at the two polling booths in the library hall of the house on Monday. It would be secret voting and no political party will issue any whip on its MLAs or MPs to favour any particular candidate. 

 The two presidential candidates in the race are  , former Lok Sabha Speaker and daughter of former deputy PM Jagijwan Ram, and  , former Bihar governor. The MLAs concerned will be free to mention their first and second choice candidates. 
 
 As per the party-wise position, 71 MLAs of the JD(U) and 58 MLAs of the BJP-led NDA are likely to vote for Kovind, while 80 MLAs of the RJD, 27 of the Congress and three of the CPI(ML) have announced their support to Meira. It’s not clear whom the four Independent MLAs would vote for. 
 
 Bihar assembly secretariat secretary Ram Shreshtha Rai said RJD MLA from Obra (Aurangabad) Birendra Kumar Sinha, who is at Dehradun in connection with the school-related matters of his ward, has been allowed by the   Commission (EC) to cast his vote at the polling booth in Uttarakhand assembly. 
 
 Rai also said RJD MLA from Nawada Rajballabh Yadav and CPI(ML) MLA Satyadeo Ram, both in jail, would participate in the election with permission from court.
 
 Once the voting is over, the ballot box would be taken to Delhi by Rai.
 
 Besides, the EC has also asked the electors to mark their preference votes only with the special pen having violet ink provided by the EC for the purpose.
 
 Rai said the MLAs should write ‘1’ (in figure, not word) on the side of their first preference candidate and ‘2’ on the side of the second preferential candidate. Indicating their choice in any other manner would make their votes invalid, he added.
 
 Patna DM Sanjay Kumar Agarwal supervised the preparations on Saturday. The police also conducted rehearsal of the security arrangements, he added.
