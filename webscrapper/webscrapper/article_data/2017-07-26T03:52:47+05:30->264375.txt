 When time came for them to leave for the Parliament House, Mukherjee escorted   to the waiting car, a limousine, showing him the portraits of former presidents as they walked out of Rashtrapati Bhavan. Before leaving, Mukherjee took the last salute of the President’s Bodyguard (PBG), the cavalry regiment of the Army, at the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan.
 
 Accompanying the limousine was a grand equestrian procession by the PBG, dressed in white ceremonial uniforms and blue turbans with gold ornamental work.
 
 The road from Rashtrapati Bhavan to Parliament was lined with 1,000 personnel from all three Services offering the traditional ‘hazaar salaam’ to the President, the supreme commander of the defence forces.
 
 At Parliament, Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and Chief Justice of India J S Kehar were waiting to receive the two.

Kovind and Mukherjee reached Rashtrapati Bhavan, where the former took charge after signing the register. Afterwards, Kovind came out to the forecourt in the presidential buggy, a black carriage with the national emblem — the Ashoka insignia — embossed in gold and drawn by six horses.
 
 Kovind inspected the guard of honour and returned inside. He then escorted Mukherjee to the forecourt in the buggy, where the former president was given the last guard of honour. Kovind thereafter dropped him at his new residence at 10, Rajaji Marg.
