 
 I am a taxidermist and my job is unique in many ways. This job involves stuffing wild and domestic animals, birds and fish along with the restoration of already existing   specimens in India. I work at India's only taxidermy centre at  , Mumbai. The specimens that we curate are utilised for research or for educational purpose.
 
 Since I was always interested in preservation, I decided to pursue a post graduate diploma in Museology and Conservation from   (CSMVS) in Mumbai. The course allows me to utilise my interest in taxidermy and learn more about art and restoration of ancient specimens, painting and artefacts.
 
 The course is focused on training students as museum professionals and help conserve and preserve national heritage. The course aims at enabling students to improve conditions of museums in the country and preserve artefacts.
 
 It also educates students on the functioning of a museum, organising exhibitions and conserving heritage artefacts.
 
 
 
 
 After the completion of this course, you have a number of job profiles to pick from. You can opt for a job role that you are comfortable with - curatorial, managing various departments, conservatory, exhibition coordinator, exhibition planner etc. You can also look into museum development or education department which deals with various programmes specifically designed for students. If technology and the digital world intrigues you, then you can get into technical and digital field and manage the photography and videography section or the museum's online presence.
