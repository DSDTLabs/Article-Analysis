PORVORIM: The state will soon have a disaster management command and control centre that will help response teams take preventive measures or proactive steps to mitigate the impact of flooding, landslides, or tree collapses.

 A request for proposal (RFP) has been floated by the revenue department and the agency could be selected by June, revenue minister   said after attending a review meet of the state disaster management authority on Wednesday. 
 
 “As part of the project, a state disaster operations centre and district disaster response centres will be set up. They will have equipment like rain gauges and weather stations, and will be able to monitor disaster-prone areas in real-time,”   said.
 
  The selected agency will also set up command and control systems at vulnerable spots. “Once the rain gauges are installed, they will send an alert if the water level rises. There will be IT-enabled systems and sensors that will be linked to gauges. For instance, if the water rises in  , we will get an alert and won’t need to wait for a report to take precautionary measures,” the minister said. As part of the plan, all helplines in Goa will also be integrated into one number.
 
 Khaunte further ordered the north and south Goa collectors to stop all road construction activity by May 15. “Directions have already been issued to the departments concerned to stop cutting or digging works,” he said.
