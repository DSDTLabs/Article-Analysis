HYDERABAD: Congress legislators — Komatireddy Venkat Reddy and SA   —have decided to lodge an online complaint with the   ( ) against what they described as a “unilateral decision” of the ruling TRS to expel them from the membership of state legislative assembly.

 In addition to waging a legal battle against their expulsion, the two MLAs said that they would present their case and the sequence of events on Monday to ECI and urge the commission not to declare Nalgonda and Alampur assembly constituencies, represented by Komatireddy and Sampath respectively, vacant.
 
 Meanwhile, former vicechairman of National Disaster Management Authority and Congress election cell chief   has also sought an appointment with ECI to submitting the party’s version.
 
 TPCC chief N Uttam Kumar Reddy said they would lodge a complaint with President Ram Nath Kovind against assembly speaker   for not allowing Congress MLAs to give out their version and urge party MPs to raise the issue in Parliament. He said the CM and speaker did not uphold the sanctity of the Assembly.
 
 Uttam Kumar said the Congress will retaliate. He said the expulsion and suspensions were part of the CM’s larger gameplan to wind up the budget session so that the government’s failures are not exposed. “Neither Telangana nor the budget is KCR’s father’s personal property,” he said.
 
 The TPCC chief termed the expulsion of Komatireddy and Sampath “illegal” and said that an MLA could not be disqualified by passing a motion in the Assembly. “This seems to be the new language of KCR. Pass a motion in the Assembly, sack opposition MLAs and then throw them out using police force. If this becomes a norm, then the party in power will act as per its will. There will be no need for democracy,” he said.
