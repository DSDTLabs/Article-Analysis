JAIPUR:   met   during her   on Saturday. The chief minister wants to keep Gujjars in good humour even as the Supreme Court has reserved its   (SLP) related to special backward classes (SBC) quota struck down by the high court.

 Bainsla speaking to TOI over phone said, “We discussed many things, including reservation and development and were assured of an early resolution to the  .” The aging Gujjar leader was the one who put his foot down and shot down the suggestion from some sections of Gujjar leaders for embarking on anther agitation after the high court struck down the 5% reservation to the SBC which included the Gujjars.
 
 Bainsla pacified the community by arguing that since the government is on the side of the Gujjars, there is no point in going for another agitation, instead they should wait for the outcome of the SLP filed by the government. Chief minister Vasundhara Raje who has set a target of 180 seats in the next assembly elections wants the support of Gujjars as she seeks another term in office.
 
 Chief minister Raje who decided to quell some dissidents like Ghanshyam Tiwari, knows that wooing influential community leaders is crucial to her game plan. Tiwari a vocal Raje baiter has been served notice by the party for indiscipline.
 
 She is also wooing another caste leader Kirori Lal Meena. Meena, a BJP stalwart left the saffron party after he fell out with Raje. Meena who was out of power after his split with the party is now a much mellowed man and has met the chief minister a couple of times. It will not be a surprise if he comes back into the party fold before the assembly elections, according to party sources.
