CHANDIGARH: With online crime rising due to the advent of social media and online frauds, Chandigarh may just be in the need of a full-blown cyber   station, instead of just a cell.

 The number of complaints reaching the cyber cell of UT police rose by 52% in three years, from 1,438 in 2015 to 2,207 in 2017. The figure for 2016 was 1,644. Even as the number of complaints rose, fewer complaints were converted into FIRs. While 50 complaints became FIRs in 2015, this figure was 34 in 2016 and 37 in 2017.
 
 The in-charge of the cell, inspector Harinder Singh Shekhon, said the highest number of complaints was related to defamation on social media. “We sort out most of these complaints at our end. People also reach us with complaints related to ATM card cloning and money getting debited from their bank accounts. Online insurance frauds are reported in large numbers,” he said.
 
 
  
 
 An IT expert,  , cited the rise in the number of online users for the increase in cybercrime. “If there are more users, there will be more chances of such crimes,” he said.
 
 Rana put his weight behind having a police station for tackling cybercrime in Chandigarh. “Cities like Hyderabad, Jaipur and Bengaluru, too, have separate cyber police stations. Investigation of any cybercrime requires time in comparison to other crimes,” he said. In all, the cell received 5,289 complaints in three years. The cell sent a request for establishing a separate police station to senior officers around three years ago, but to no avail, said sources in the force.
