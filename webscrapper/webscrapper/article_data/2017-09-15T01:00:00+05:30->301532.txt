 After featuring in '  2',   has now been roped in to play the male lead in 'Bhootu'. The show is about  , a seven-year-old ghost who embarks on a journey to find her mother.
 Talking about acting in another show in the supernatural genre, Kinshuk says, “Naagin was a revenge-based supernatural drama. Bhootu also falls in the same genre, but is light-hearted.” 
 Ask him if he believes in ghosts and he replies, “Yes, I do. If there’s God, there must be other powers, too. However, I have never experienced any encounter of the supernatural kind.”
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 A fast without food is well known, but   abstained from shaving his facial hair for the last one year. We hear that the actor was not able to shave off his beard for that whole time since his character in 'Love Ka Hai Intezaar' demanded it. Keith tells us, “I haven’t been clean shaven since the past one year. When doing a daily, an actor isn’t able to experiment as much with his appearance because he needs to stick to the look that is required. I am looking forward to experimenting with a completely different look post the show.”
