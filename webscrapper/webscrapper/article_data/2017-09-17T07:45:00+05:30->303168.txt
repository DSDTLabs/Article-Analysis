Shimla: As many as 178 children with disabilities across Himachal Pradesh reached Shimla’s Bishop Cotton School to celebrate two-day long ‘18th Festival Of Differently Abled’, which was concluded on Saturday.

 The event witnessed a wide range of activities ranging from cultural shows, march past, sports events to a special fair. Other activities at the event included games like bhookha rakshas, ringing the bell, animal races, skittles and lucky dip.
 
 School administration said that all the activities were planned so that all these children can participate in a stress-free and non-competitive atmosphere.
 
 “The learning centre of Bishop Cotton School is providing a comprehensive programme on functional academics, social skills, activities of daily living, communication skills and pre-vocational skills to help children with disabilities face the world,” said head of Junior School at Bishop Cotton School Shimla Dorothy I. Robinson.
 
 “An important element of the programme was to encourage these children in gaining acceptance, social awareness and confidence,” she added.
 
 The event was first organized in the year 2000.
