 The popular show   seems no less than a matrimonial service, if one could call it as. And why so? A look at its history and we have a lot of actors paired opposite to each other in the show, who actually fell in love in real life too.
 
 After   and  , the recent couple who has come out confessing their love for each other is   and Priyanka Udhwani. The actors were paired opposite each other in the show as   and Karishma.
 
  While exclusively talking to us, Anshul confessed his relationship. "Yes, we have been dating for over two years now," said the actor. Ask him how did they manage to keep their relationship away from the media glare for so long and Anshul says, "It wasn't intentional. Just that it happened to stay away from the paparazzi. It's funny how questions pertaining to my relationship are asked now, months after I have quit Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai."
 
  
  
  
 
  Further elaborating on their relationship, the actor said, "We fell in love on the sets of Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai. I realised it within no time that I had fallen for Priyanka. There's never a dull moment with her. She keeps my life lively and happening, that is one thing that makes me fall in love with her all over again."
 
  
  
  Now that Anshul is no longer shooting for YRKKH, how do the two manage to spend quality time with each other owing to Priyanka's hectic schedule? "Currently, it's all dependent on her. I manage my things according to it and we make sure to catch up everyday once she is done shooting. Plus we are gym partners as well. We work out together," said the actor.
 
 Well, after all the couple that works out together, stays together!
 
  
  
 Anshul and Priyanka essayed the role of Naman and Karishma in Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai. Anshul quit the show almost a year ago while Priyanka chose to stay back.
