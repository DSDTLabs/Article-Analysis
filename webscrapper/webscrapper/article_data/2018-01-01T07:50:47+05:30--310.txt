HYDERABAD: Each New Year seems to bring lesser and lesser joy to traditional paper kite makers in  , with the market experiencing a major slump. The kite makers in the patang markets of   say the situation has turned worse after loads of Chinese kites have invaded the market in the weeks building up to Sankranti. 

 Several traders like   of Dhoolpet, whose family has been in the business of kite-making for over 30 years, is also feeling the pinch due to the Chinese kites. "The traditional kite market is on the verge of disappearing. People prefer fancy Chinese kites to the traditional paper ones that we have been making here for ages. We have reduced production by 50% in the last two years,"   said.
 
 It's not only Singh, most families that make kites for a living in Old City share similar woes. A few have already switched over to other options.
 
 "Even after working for several hours to make kites each year, we hardly earn any profits. This year, it was difficult to even find craftsmen as most of them are switching professions," said Sameer, a kite maker at Yakutpura.
 
 Craftsmen earn between 50 and 150 to make 100 kites and each person can make about 30 to 50 kites each day depending on the size. "It is a difficult job and requires a lot of patience. Even after putting in so much effort, we are deprived of a decent earning. Only two people out of 10 prefer paper kites these days," said Sameer. 
 
 In the last two years, more than 60% of the families have dropped out of traditional kite-making owing to the lack of profits, he added.
