VADODARA: Three   remained in fray for the post of the   (MSUSU)   (VP) even as five will contest on the   (UGS) of the union. The polls are scheduled to be held on October 5.

 On the last day of withdrawal of nominations for the polls, four students withdrew nominations for the post of vice president that is reserved for a girl student. Those in the fray include Bhavna Kumari from the National Students Union of India (NSUI), Aishwarya Mayavanshi and Rati Mehta from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP).
 
 Those contesting for the post of UGS include Darshan Bhanushali from NSUI, Harshil Mistry, outgoing VP Priyanka Patel, Hemendra Rajavat and Ronak Shrivastava from ABVP. Two candidates withdrew nominations for the polls in this category. Meanwhile the university had sought indelible ink from the district administration for the polls. But the request has been turned down in wake of the ensuing assembly polls.
 
 The university has 39,407 students registered as voters for the polls. The fate of the votes of around 350 students from the Baroda Medical College, however, hangs in balance as they have not been issued fee challans yet and do not have fee receipts that are mandatory for voting in the polls.
