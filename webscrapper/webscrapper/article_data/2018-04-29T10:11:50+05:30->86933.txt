SHIMLA: There is a rise in online frauds reported from Himachal Pradesh in which people’s debit cards have been used for making purchases abroad, according to the police. The in-charge of the cyber crime police station in Shimla, DSP Narvir Singh Rathour, said there had been a rise in such complaints of late.

 He added customer were unaware of such transactions as they did not get any OTP (one time password) request. “This is because this option is available only in in domestic payment gateways,” he said.
 
 He said that to avoid such cases, customer could disable their credit or debit cards for international transaction usage. He said that customers can call toll free numbers mentioned on the their card. “We can stop this facility by using internet banking. RBI also has issued guidelines to bankers that all new debit and credit cards issued by banks will allow usage in India only. If the customer wants to carry out international purchase then the cards must have EMV ship embedded and must generate pin.
 
 Banks had already put a threshold limit on international usage beyond,” he said. He said that by creating awareness among general customer about these changes in debit or credit card facilities only the chances of fraud could be prevented and online transaction could be made safer.
