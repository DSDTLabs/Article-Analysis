Vadodara: Even as the University Grants Commission (UGC) has put on hold financial disbursement to universities across the country, M S University has taken a policy decision whereby professional development of its academic staff will not come to a halt because of want of grants. 

 MSU has created a budget head – ‘Academic Staff Development Fund’ with the motive to promote academic professional development of its staff. 
 
 “We have allocated a budget of Rs 40 lakh under the academic staff development fund, which will be used to provide assistance to teachers in form of travel funds for travelling within and outside the country,” said Parimal Vyas, MSU vice-chancellor professor. 
 
 “Similarly, the fund can be used for organizing conferences, seminars and workshops, inviting experts for guest lectures and publishing papers,” said Vyas, adding that the new policy – the first of its kind to be introduced by the university – has been approved by the syndicate members during their recent meeting. 
 
 “We have taken this policy decision so that no scheme, project work or research programme gets affected due to want of funds,” he said. 
 
 Neerja Jaiswal, MSU’s in-charge registrar, said, “Of the Rs 40 lakh sanctioned under the budget head, Rs 20 lakh can be used as travel funds, Rs 10 lakh for organizing conferences, seminars and workshops and Rs five lakh each for inviting experts for guest lectures and publishing papers.”
 
 “The expenditure of the same will be met by testing fees, consultancy fees and the management charges that are collected from the research projects that are sanctioned by various funding agencies,” she said. 
 
 During the recent syndicate meet, travel expenses of nine teachers from the varsity who had travelled abroad and around 44 teachers who had travelled within the country for various projects were sanctioned by the university.
 
 “UGC has anyways decided that it is not going to provide any support to universities in form of travel grants,” said a university official.
