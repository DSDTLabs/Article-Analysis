 A brutal match with Strowman punishing Reigns early on, but the Big Dog retailed with chairs but to no avail. It was a back and forth battle and Reigns went for broke and ran for the spear; Strowman moved away and Reigns crashed in to the Ambulance to hand Strowman the win. But the Reigns reappeared from the Ambulance and speared Strowman. He then dumped the Monster among in to the Ambulance and drove him to the backstage arena. Reigns then drove the Ambulance in a trailer and walked away. Strowman was trapped in the mangled Ambulance and it took a while for the local fire department to free Strowman. A visibly battered Strowman walked away denying any medical assistance.
