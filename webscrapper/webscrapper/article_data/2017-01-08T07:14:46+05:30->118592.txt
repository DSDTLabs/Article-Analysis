LUCKNOW: Ruling out a truce between the warring factions of Samajwadi Party, the Akhilesh camp approached   on Saturday claiming that 4,716 of party’s total 5,731 delegates are with the CM.

 Akhilesh camp’s chief strategist   arrived at the   office in Delhi with seven cartons of documents in support of his claim. Ram Gopal’s move suggests that the Akhilesh camp is pushing for endgame and is unwilling to step back or broker peace.
 
 In the afternoon, meetings between senior minister   and leaders from the Mulayam-Shivpal camp remained inconclusive.   reached the EC office around 7pm — two days before the January 9 deadline — and submitted documents running in 1.5 lakh pages. 
 
 He said the cartons contained individual affidavits signed by delegates, including those by 205 MLAs, 56 MLCs, 15 MPs, and 30 members of the national executive. “Prima facie, the real SP is led by   and he should be given the right to retain the bicycle symbol,” he said.
