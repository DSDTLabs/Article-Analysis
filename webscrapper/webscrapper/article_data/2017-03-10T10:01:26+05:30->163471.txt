THRISSUR: The   authorities, on Thursday, appealed to the   to take action against those who had blocked the   to the temple on Wednesday night. 

 Devaswom chairman M Peethambara Kurup said that the entire water, about 12,000 litres, was drained out of the tanker by some residents. He demanded action against the SI of a nearby police station, who was allegedly present at the scene. 
 
 According to reports, the SI was shouting at the tanker driver and cleaner for carrying excess quantity of water, he said.
 
  The residents were protesting alleging that the continuous supply of water to the temple would drain off the water sources in the area. 
 
 "The police officer could have warned the tanker staff and devaswom or even imposed a fine, instead of allowing the protesters to waste the water. Ironically, a government official was indulging in such an act when the chief minister had appealed to the people not to waste a drop of water,'' said devaswom member A Sureshan.
 
 Responding to allegations that   leaders were behind the blockade, the chairman said: "The devaswom authorities don't want to be dragged into controversies. It is for the police to find out who were the protesters. But we want the government to take steps to ensure adequate water supply to the devaswom,'' he said.
 
 The devaswom managing committee held an emergency meeting to discuss the water crisis in Guruvayur and appealed to the government to intervene at the earliest to resolve it.
 
  Opposition leader   had also referred to the issue in the assembly, leading to unruly scenes and adjournment of the House for about an hour on Thursday.
