GREATER NOIDA: Five   within a week in Sector Beta 1,  , has left the   about their safety in this small area.

 Hemant Kumar Budhlakoti, a resident of Block E 78, Sector Beta 1, said his motorbike was stolen from his house around 9.30 pm on Sunday. “I complained at Sector Beta 2 police station. But there has been no lead so far,” Budhlakoti told TOI.
 
 Another resident, Saurav Sharma of Flat No. 52, Block A (Janta flat), lost his bike on Saturday. “We have filed a complaint with Beta 2 police station and are waiting for copy of the FIR. The bike has not been found so far,” said Bhojrao Kumbhare, neighbour of Sharma.
 
 According to Kumbhare, the sector has a number of tenants and despite various tenant verification drives in the past, more than the number of permitted members live per accommodation. The houses are mostly occupied by students. “The owners do not live here and hardly take responsibility of the occupants. They are only interested in the rent. As a result, students roam around till late night with no check on who’s coming and going to their rented place. All this has created major security issues in the area,” said Kumbhare.
 
 Earlier last week, robbers struck at the residence of Ram Upadhyaya at E 76, Sector Beta 1 and stole one laptop and Rs 8,000 in cash. In another incident at A 155, a resident was robbed of Rs 3,000 in cash and a laptop. Another laptop was stolen from E 87 in Sector Beta 1.
