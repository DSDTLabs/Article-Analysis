Thiruvananthapuram: In a bid to reduce the   congestion on city roads, the traffic police on Republic Day introduced new regulations and restrictions regarding   and roadside vending at various places in the city. City traffic police inspector K Pradeep said that the regulations were implemented after receiving countless complaints from the public about the improper parking of vehicles at many places.

 The parking along the Keston Road, which extends from Devaswom Board junction to Akkamma Cherian Park, has been prohibited. The roadside food vendors near Vellayambalam traffic circle also should stop operation. The parking along Spencer’s Junction-Jacob’s Junction- Cantonment Gate road also will not be permitted, said a statement by traffic police.
 
 Police said that the authorities of auditoriums and concert halls should arrange parking facility for the vehicles coming for weddings and other private functions as parking will not be permitted along main roads. Also, the parallel services used for transporting school students will not be allowed to park on roadsides any more. “We have issued notices to schools and auditoriums regarding this and if the rules are violated again, action will be taken. The public should cooperate with us to reduce traffic jams,” said Pradeep.
