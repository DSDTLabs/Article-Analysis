Surat: The hydraulic department of the Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has detected 1,250 leakages in its water supply network in the last one month in the city. It has also severed 200 illegal connections. At present,  ,400 million cubic metre (MCM) of water left, which translates to 21 per cent of its storage capacity. The water level in the dam is at 301 feet mark. Thus, SMC may be forced to cut its supply by further 10 per cent because it relies on Ukai dam for its water needs. 

 Superintending engineer of Surat irrigation circle S Mahakal said, “We would release 500 MCM of water for irrigation purpose and hope to pull through July when there would be inflow into river Tapi and Ukai dam because of rainfall in their catchment areas.” 
 
 Presently, Surat city gets about 30 MCM of water per month. In the months of May, June and July, it would need another 100 MCM of water. But the demand for water would rise because of peak summer months.
 
 Additional city engineer, SMC, A H Khatwani said, “We expect demand for water to go up by at least 50 MLD in May. With 10 per cent cut at present, we are supplying 1,150 MLD of water daily. We are not looking at another cut in supply because by plugging leakages and severing illegal connections, we have been able to save water in some quantity.” 
 
 Meanwhile, Ukai dam authorities were compelled to release water at the rate of 2,000 cusec in the river as the water level at weir-cum-causeway had dipped to 4.4 metre. 
 
 “Unless the water level at the weir-cum-causeway comes up to 5 metre, there will be issues with regard to the quality of raw water,” an officer of SMC’s hydraulic department. said.
