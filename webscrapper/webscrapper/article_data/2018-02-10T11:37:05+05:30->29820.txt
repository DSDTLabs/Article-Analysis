BHOPAL: The   seems to have failed in producing enough athletes who can compete at national level. The state team could only manage the 12th position out of the 27 states at the inaugural   Games.

 The MP team won only 15 medals, including 4 gold and 3 silver medals. Ironically, smaller states like Manipur won 13 gold medals and grabbed the fifth position with a tally of 33 medals. Incidentally, the 75-member MP squad was accompanied by 45 officials.
 
  said the school education department needs to pull up its socks and think seriously to avoid such embarrassment at the national-level. “School education department can learn from sports and youth welfare department and chalk-out a proper plan. Such is the situation that the school education department does not have a single ground,” said asenior coach.
 
 Another coach said the school education department has never given due importance to the school-level games. “The way the district and statelevel meets have been organised by the the school education department, it is enough to gauge the apathy,” alleged the coach. Incidentally, last year when school education minister   was asked about Asian hockey championship being organised on tattered hockey turf, he went on saying that “Hum usko silwa lenge (We will get the turf stitched).”
 
 Coaches also questioned the logic of sending athletes to Australia. “What the state’s school athletes have got from playing in Pacific Games? Despite several criticisms, several officials accompanied the 11-member team from the state. School education department should think seriously about providing better facilities as there is no dearth of talent,” said another coach.
