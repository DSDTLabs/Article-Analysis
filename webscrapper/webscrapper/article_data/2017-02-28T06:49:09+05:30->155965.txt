GANDHINAGAR: The leader of opposition in the Gujarat assembly,  , took a dig at the BJP by saying that the saffron party’s governments in the Centre and state are promoting “Make in India”, but the statue of   to be installed at Sadhu Bet near the Narmada dam is “Made in China”.

 Speaking on the motion of thanks for governor’s speech, Vaghela asked the government about the iron scrap collected by the BJP, ostensibly for construction of the Sardar statue. He said no one knows what happened to the scrap, as the statue is not being made from scrap.
 
  Vaghela said he thought that the government, after the Naliya rape scandal, would be vigilant and make sure there were no further rape cases, but a women was recently raped in Kutch when she went to a doctor for treatment. Vaghela also demanded that speaker Ramanlal Vora take the lead and order an investigation into the Naliya scandal by a high court judge, as the people have begun questioning the credibility of both parties.
 
 Vaghela further said that the BJP talks about ahimsa on one hand and on the other they attacked Patidar youth who were demanding reservation. Referring to the governor’s speech, he said the government spoke of tightening prohibition and taking action against hookah bars, but the Vadodara incident, where a businessman was caught throwing a liquor party, speaks volumes of the BJP’s seriousness on the issue.
 
 Vaghela alleged rampant corruption in the laying of pipelines for the Narmada project. He said that the BJP was celebrating the installation of gates at the Sardar dam, but what after that? Can the state close these gates? He further said that   was not meant for attracting investment but was a summit for personal publicity. He said   is being used excessively by the government. “The government invested crores to build Mahatma Mandir and the return is zero,” he said.
