Variety seems to be the spice of life for Varalaxmi, who has been choosing projects that give her scope to experiment with her characters. Joining the list of films in which she has interesting roles is  , in which the actress will be seen playing a ‘snake woman’. The film, directed by  , has already gone on floors and   has even finished shooting a song for it.
 The actress tells us, “The song was picturised in the middle of a forest in  , and we had to hike for almost 45 minutes to reach the location from the base. It was on a mountain and the location is beautiful. Kala master has choreographed the song, which is very integral to the plot. It’s like there’s a story within the song.”
 
 Ask her if she was anxious while shooting this ‘pambu dance’, which’s quite popular in both the south film industries and in Bollywood, and she says, “This is not exactly a ‘pambu dance’. It’s close dancing that you do with your partner. And since I’m into salsa, this was not a huge thing for me.”
 
 Meanwhile, Suresh, we hear, has spent more than three months on ground to finalise the look of the 22-ft snake in the film. “A rajanaagam plays a crucial role in the script, and to decide on its look for the VFX portion, we travelled all over India and Thailand, and finally found a reference point at a place near Bangkok. We had to take a flight and then drive by car to reach the place. It’s famous for hosting cobra shows and that’s where we spotted this species. We filmed the show on camera, spoke to several people and observed its characteristics and behaviour. We’ll use this as our reference,” he tells us, adding, “While most snake films are based on revenge, this is a passionate love story.”
