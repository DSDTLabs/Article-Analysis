GANDHINAGAR:   president   said that the Gujarat and national BJP fears that if early elections are held in Gujarat, the BJP will lose badly.
Solanki said they were hence shying away from having early elections here and wanted to avoid Gujarat voting alongside UP and the four other states. Solanki said: “The upcoming polls in Uttar Pradesh four other states will be vital and decisive for the future of the Indian political scenario. The election commission has announced dates for five states.
 
 The BJP government has taken reckless and unreasonable decisions which have dragged the nation into the darkness of high prices,  , under the vanity of their majority .A recent example is the unrest and chaos of demonetisation that has put 99.99% of the people of the country in trouble.“
 
 “Surveys show the declining popularity of BJP in Gujarat. BJP fears early elections in Gujarat, so it avoided calling for elections with UP .
