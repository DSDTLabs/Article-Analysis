Film and television actress   was in Kanpur recently to stage the play ' '. On her first visit to the industrial town,   said, "I have heard a lot about Kanpur. Yahaan aane ke baad mera kuch locals se jab milna hua tab mujhe laga hi nahi ki main unse pehli baar mil rahi hoon. People in Kanpur and Lucknow are very warm hearted. I find both places to be very interesting with a lot of history attached to them. Even enroute Kanpur from Lucknow, I saw these places where I just wanted to stop and explore them more," said the actress. 

 "It's not very often that I travel to places which are so interesting and intriguing," said the actress, whoâ€™s known for her roles in films 'Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai', 'Hamara Dil Aapke Paas Hai' and ' ' and several TV shows including 'Bigg Boss'.
 Though it was a quick and tightly scheduled visit to Kanpur for Tannaz, but she was excited about shopping in Lucknow and Kanpur. "Before coming to Kanpur, my friends in Mumbai told me to pick up leather footwear from Kanpur and chikan suits from Lucknow. They also told me to try mughlai dishes in Lucknow and sweets in Kanpur. Iss baar toh Kanpur main shopping par nahi jaa saki par next time jab bhi yahaan aayi, tab shopping toh pakka karna hi hai mujhe," she said.

 Tannaz who has done an array of films and serials, feels happy about returning to stage after a gap of 10-years. "For the past few years, I was really busy with films and television projects. But after a decade,   once again beckoned me. I directed and acted in a play named 'Selfie' and after that I acted in 'Wrong Number'. Frankly speaking, I am really enjoying my return to theatre. I guess I will keep doing it more often now," she said with a smile.
