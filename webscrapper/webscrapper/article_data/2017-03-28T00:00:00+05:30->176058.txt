Twenty years after the Tamil political drama Iruvar hit the screens, the film’s lead actors   and   are teaming up for a movie in Malayalam.
Touted to be the most expensive film ever made in the industry, the movie titled   will be directed by ad filmmaker V A Sreekumar and has   as the female lead.
 
 The filmmaker, who will also be directing Randamoozham in 2018, tells us, “It’s too early to speak in detail about Odiyan or its characters. I would say that Manju’s role is as prominent as that of Mohanlal’s. She is quite a strong woman in the story. Also, Prakash Raj’s antagonist would be one of the most powerful villain characters that has taken shape so far in the industry.”
 
 Apart from the trio, a leading Bollywood actor and Siddique will play pivotal characters in the film, which is set to go on floors by May 25.
 The makers have also roped in Peter Hein for choreographing the action scenes in the movie. Sreekumar says, “The movie has a different level of action packed into it and it’s one of the major elements of the film.”
 
 Sabu Cyril will be the production designer for Odiyan, which is scripted by National Award winner Harikrishnan. The film will be shot in Palakkad, Coimbatore, Pollachi, Hyderabad, and Varanasi.
