NAGPUR: Though the   keeps making tall claims on improving services, the ground reality is far from satisfactory as   continue to overcharge passengers for meals, that too bad in quality, during journey. Many startling facts came to light when TOI took stock of the situation at   on March 26. 

 Indian   has hired private vendors to serve meals aboard trains. IRCTC had released details of the services via tweets and videos. TOI found most of the travellers were unaware and were being cheated.
 
 Jeet Singh, a resident of Nashik travelling on 18029 LTT—Shalimar Express via Nagpur said, “I paid Rs 100 for a vegetarian meal.” Another passenger Sunil Kumar said, “I have been travelling for the last five years but never paid less than Rs100.” The official charge for the vegetarian food is Rs50. He said, “In Gitanjali (train no. 12859/60) and Azad Hind (12129/30), the passengers have to cough up Rs 150 and Rs 180 for veg and non-veg food.”
 
 Waqar Mahar, who was travelling on   (train no. 82651), was visibly annoyed over the cheating and said that lack of awareness was the main reason behind the exploitation. Only one passenger, Tanil Naidu, was awareness about the price of meals out of almost 150 travellers TOI spoke to. Naidu said, “People avoid getting involved into a brawl with caterers for a sum of Rs 20 to Rs 30 and do not complain to the authorities. But, vendors are now going overboard and charging more than 100% extra,” he said. 
 
 Vendors refused to give information about the discrepancy in rate of meals.
 
 Manoj Dubey, catering in charge at Nagpur platform, said that his jurisdiction is restricted and that he has no knowledge of how much vendors charge elsewhere. The meal at the platform was good and within the specified price range.
