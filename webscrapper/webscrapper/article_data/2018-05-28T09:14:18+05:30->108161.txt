CHANDIGARH: A day after the nationwide protests against the ruling   in Centre, the Haryana   leaders on Sunday intensified their attack on Prime Minister Narendera Modi and Haryana CM  .

 Addressing a workers’-cum-public rally in   village in the heart of Narnaund assembly constituency , currently held by finance minister Capt Abhimanyu,   announced to provide a loan waiver up to Rs 50,000 for small farmers with up to two acres of land if elected.
 
 While advocating the farm loan waiver to Haryana farmers and landless poor, Surjewala said the government was not providing the MSP and due rates to farmers for their produce. The government has failed to provide even the officially announced minimum support prices for various crops, he said.
 
 Questioning the Modi and Khattar governments for not waiving off farm loans, Surjewala said when Rs 2,41,000 crore of loan of a dozen industrials can be waived off why the similar loan waiver cannot be given to India’s 62 crore farmers, which is merely Rs 2 lakh crore.
 
 Criticizing the BJP he said, “The BJP has failed the people of Haryana and the country. The people are so annoyed and angry with them that they are desperately waiting for the elections to oust them from power.”
 
 Tanwar flayed Khattar and BJP in Karnal
 
 HPCC president Ashok Tanwar on Sunday flayed the BJP government in the Centre as well as the state for showing ‘disrespect’ to the Constitution of India, especially in relation to the issues of the Dalits and the down-trodden people of society. “The way this government is trying to move against constitutional provisions, it is just trying to work above the law of the land. This way we are heading towards another round of slavery,” said Tanwar.
