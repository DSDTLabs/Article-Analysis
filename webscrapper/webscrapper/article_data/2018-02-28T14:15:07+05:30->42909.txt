MUMBAI: Starting Thursday, over 3.83 lakh Class X students will appear in the   (SSC) exam in the  . While Mumbai continues to have the largest chunk of candidates in the state even this year, the numbers are lower compared to the previous year.

 In March 2017, 3.86 lakh candidates took the SSC examination in the Mumbai division, which includes Mumbai, Raigad, Thane and Palghar. “One of the probable reasons for fewer candidates this year could be the good results last year. There could be a lower number of repeater students this year,” said Subhash Borse, in-charge secretary of the Mumbai division.
 
 In the shadow of last year’s   paper leaks, SSC students too will have to follow the 11am deadline to reach the centre. Except English, the first language paper will be held in the morning session, while the French paper will be in the second session on Thursday.
 
 Several parents of special needs students complained they had trouble getting permission for a writer. “We are unable to find a Class IX student to write for my physically handicapped son. When we asked the board for an adult writer, it turned down our demand stating the writer had a professional degree and could help the student,” said a parent from Dombivli. Board officials said as per rules an adult writer can be allowed only if a class IX student is not available.
