THANE: The Thane forest officials roped in around 70 young environmentalists to keep an eye on littering and prevent incidents of forest fire with thousands of devotees visiting the Shiva temples at   hills on Friday.

 The team of around 120 forest staff and volunteers spread across different parts -- Pakkad Baba, Gaikwad Baba, Phadkacha Pani, Bhoir Baba temple areas and so on -- frisked visitors and seized match boxes, tobacco packets,   bags and other items that could pollute the forest area. 
 
 “We have seen around 4,000 to 5,000 devotees at one spot itself and have collected three bagful of plastic, tobacco products and inflammable items since 7am on Friday. We have been frisking each person and checking all bags to be thorough,” said Shiva Thakur, a volunteer and member of an environmental group. 
 
  Yeoor range forest officer,  , said, “The entire green zone in  , including the Yeoor and Tulsi ranges, have recently been termed as eco-sensitive zones. In order to safeguard these zones we sent out a notification to all residents informing them the do’s and don’ts in the forest area.”
 
 “In addition to this, we delegated our 40 forest staff to different parts of the ranges and roped in close to 70 volunteers belonging to different non government organisations to participate in our vigilance drive on Friday. While the drive went on from 7am to sunset, we restricted all entry in the forest post sunset. All the seized items were disposed off at the end of the drive,” added Waghmode.
