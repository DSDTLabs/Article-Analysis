 The album begins with Oh Annan Maare that initially begins like a tribal song. The song then gets a very rustic feel, with the sounds of chicken, cows, etc. The track is more like an announcement that used to be done in villages before phones were invented. The song also has dialogues in-between and the composer has used minimum instruments for this one. The chorus continues to have tribal sounds throughout the number. Gangai Amaran, who has crooned the song, has done justice to the track with a perfect village accent. 
 
  is a romantic duet, and its basic drum beats and string section make you swing along. The singers,   and Sruthi S, add soul to the track. They are perfect for a hamlet set-up. The chorus, however, is a tad funny. Nevertheless, we are curious to see how the visuals will pan out for this one. There is also a karaoke version of this song. It has been a while we heard a marriage song that is taking place in a small town. The fast-paced   is the ‘village coming together to celebrate a marriage’ song.   is a very relatable voice for such songs, and Sruthi S, who has sung the female portions, sounds confident. The lyrics of the track unfold as comparisons between the qualities of the groom and the bride. But at one point, they get emotional. 
 
 The nadaswaram takes centre-stage and the ketti-melam is also featured in the track.   is high on the thrill factor. The track begins with slokams and seems to be dedicated to Lord Bhairava. The electric guitar portion goes well with the rest of the song. This one seems to be a background track and has Veeramanidasan singing in a roaring and boisterous fashion. The violin portions are quite unexpected in a track like this. The composer sure has experimented with different sounds for the entire album, keeping in mind the backdrop of the movie.
