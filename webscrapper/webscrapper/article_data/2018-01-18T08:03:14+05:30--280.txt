 He said the state government also plans to train youth in manufacturing these products and get them marketed.

 The ‘One district one product’ scheme has been inspired from Japan’s ‘One village one product’ scheme which was initiated in 1979. The concept paper prepared by the UP government also mentions a similar initiative taken in Thailand in 2001-06. “The same model could be useful for the state from the geographical, socio-economic and financial development of the state,” the paper reads.
