A kiss ka kissa has left   fuming. Trouble started during the shoot of an emotionally charged scene in 'Khunkhar:  ', when the actress kissed her male lead   on the lips. While Ragini insists that the kiss was part of the script, the makers claim otherwise. A source says, “She was not asked to kiss Harshad, but it happened spontaneously. She kissed him out of emotions. The makers have already scrapped it.”
On the other hand, the actress, who has returned to   after a five-year break, counters, “Why will I get emotional and kiss   when I am shooting? Why would it be impromptu? It was planned and the director had asked me to kiss Harshad. And, it was just a peck on the lips, not anything serious. I was told later that the makers have scrapped it.” 
 Did Ragini get carried away, or is it another promotional stunt by the makers? The verdict is not yet out on this one.
