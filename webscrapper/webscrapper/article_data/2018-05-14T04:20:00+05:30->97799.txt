Ahmedabad: A 60-year-old grain trader from Rajasthan was robbed of Rs 5 lakh cash by a gang operating from a sharing auto rickshaw in Kalupur area. Sumar Faizmohammad Patel, a resident of Sanchor, Jhalor, has filed a complaint of theft with Madhavpura police station.

 According to his complaint, Patel had come to the city for a deal and had met a few traders in the grain market near Kalupur. He visited a cooperative bank in the area and withdrew Rs 5 lakh cash in Rs 2,000 currency notes. He then took a sharing auto to reach Visat Crossroads at 4pm. At that time, a man and a woman were sitting in the auto. “Soon after, two other men got in the auto as passengers. One of the passengers requested him to keep his bag, which contained the cash, behind the seat so that others can sit comfortably. Patel complied to the request. When the auto driver took a turn towards National Handloom instead of Visat, at 4.30pm, Patel asked the auto driver to let him alight,” said an official. After getting down, Patel checked his bag and found that the bundle of cash was gone. tnn
