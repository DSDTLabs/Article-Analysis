CHANDIGARH: He was not a professional cricketer, but such is Lakhwinder Singh’s cricketing nous that he can give any coach a run for his money. Lakhwinder, who himself wanted to play the game professionally but lack of opportunities nipped his dream in the bud, was son Shubman Gill’s first coach. Even now, whenever the youngster, Man of the Tournament in theU-19 World Cup, is in doubt over cricketing matters, he consults his father.

 
 “Shubman was interested in the sport since a very young age. He started wielding a bat at the age of three. He never liked any other toy. He would play with a bat and a ball even before going to bed.
 
 
 
 
 
 “Seeing his interest in the game, I decided to train him. I made him play 500 to 700 balls every day. To make him adept at handling fast bowling, I used to throw the ball over a manji (charpoy). The ball tends to travel faster after skidding off the charpoy. Besides that, he practcised with a single stump as his bat. That helped Shubman in finding the middle of the bat more often than not,” said Lakhwinder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To provide Shubman better training, Lakhwinder moved his family from Chak Khere Wala – a village in Fazilka district – to Mohali in 2007. Shubman’s grandparents still stay in Chak Khere Wala.
 
 “Our village is about 300 kilometers from Mohali. But due to lack of facilities there, we brought him here (in Mohali),” recalled Lakhwinder.
 
 “We fully supported him in achieving his dream to become a cricketer.”
