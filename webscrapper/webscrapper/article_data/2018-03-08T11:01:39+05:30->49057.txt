CHANDIGARH: The   (MCI) has not given recognition for additional three seats in MD (gynaecology) in   and Hospital ( ), Sector 32. The objection raised by the MCI was that the college’s department had no qualified professor as the then officiating director-principal, Dr  , had been holding multiple charges. In 2014-15 session, the PG seats in gynaecology were increased from three to six. The authorities say the MCI has not informed anything about the status of three more seats.

 The final inspection was conducted in 2017 for the award of the six PG seats in the department. However, the MCI has still not communicated anything as they had pointed out four main deficiencies. “The main objection was the then officiating director-principal had been holding the charge of the head of the pulmonary medicine, gynaecology department and also medical superintendent. When the compliance report was sent, the then officiating director principal gave the charge of medical superintendent to another faculty, but still continued to be the head in the department of pulmonary medicine in addition to directorprincipal,” said a senior faculty member.
 There were 48 PG seats in GMCH until 2013.
 
 Dr  , former director-principal and the head of the medicine and gynaecology department, said, “When I took over as the director-principal, these seats were enhanced to 118. The MCI had found the college to be eligible for nine seats in gynaecology department. However, we had asked for six and then subsequently asked for nine seats. But none of the faculty was eligible for the post of professor.”
 
 It has been three years since the HoD, gynaecology resigned from GMCH. “There were three seats for the PG, but after she left, there was no professor found eligible,” said a faculty member.
