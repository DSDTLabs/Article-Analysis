LUCKNOW: Samajwadi   chief   on Wednesday alleged international conspiracy behind the cash crunch in ATMs in the country. Accusing the Centre of inaction in resolving the crisis, hesaidtheshortageof currency notes has hit the business sector which is yet to recover from the effects of demonetization.

 “The paper for currency notes is imported from other countries and it is the duty of the governmenttoensurethat sufficient currency notes are in circulation.Butbanksdon’t have cash and the ATMs are dry,” he said, adding that such a situation points towards an international conspiracy and efforts must be made to decipher if thecurrency noteswere being hoarded as a part of the conspiracy. “I wonder if this hoarding of currency notes is at the instance of the central government,” he said, adding that there was no reason why the government was not laying its hands on those behind such a crisis.” The Centre must expose those behind the cashcrunch andtheconspiracy behindit,if any, and not pin the blames on innocent people,” theformer CMsaid.
 
 Reacting to Akhilesh’s statement,UP minister   said the SP chief was necessarily raking up a controversy even though the problem of cash crunch was being monitored by the RBI. Sharma said SP had indulged in hoarding money and that the demonetisation drive had affected it the most. “Samajwadi Party ab Sajishkarta (conspirator) Party hai,” hesaid.
