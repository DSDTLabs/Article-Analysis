KRISHNAGAR: Family members of one of the two victims, who hailed from Bengal’s Nadia, have finally got closure, but it’s something they were not looking forward to.

 
  Sikdar’s family is reluctantly coming around to accepting his death. “When someone responsible like external affairs minister   is saying so, there’s very little option left,” said a relative.
 
 Speaking to TOI from her home in Ilshamari-Madhyapara village in Nadia’s Tehatta, Khokon’s wife Namita said: “Deep inside, I can’t believe he is no more. But after this announcement at the highest level, I have no option but to accept it.”
 
 The family of  , the other victim who hailed from Mahakhola village, could not be reached. Tikadar hailed from Mahakhola village in Nadia’s Chopra. Both Tikadar and Khokon were construction workers in Mosul. The Centre had, on February 9, sent a team to Nadia to collect blood samples from Khokon’s college-going daughter  , five-year-old son Abhro and Khokon’s sister Anita, who lives nearby with her husband Subhas. “We didn’t quite understand why they took the samples. Today, it is clear it was for DNA tests,” said Subhas.
