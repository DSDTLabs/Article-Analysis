 is a festival that engulfs everyone in colourful hues, so it is that time of the year when people of all castes,   and creeds come together, forgetting their differences. It was heartening see the empowered members of   community in the city coming together for a wonderful Holi celebration. They danced, sang and enjoyed some   snacks together.
