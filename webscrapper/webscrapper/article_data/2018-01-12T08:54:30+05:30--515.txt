MARGAO: Fransisco Duarte  , the consul general of   in Goa, on Thursday said Portugal has strong links with Goa not only in the field of legal studies but also in matters governing civilian life. 

 The Goa Civil Code, largely based on the Portuguese Civil Code of 1867, lays down rules governing one’s life, Azevedo said, thus rendering the Code intrinsically connected to the way one lives his life.
 
 “In the past,” Azevedo said, “books of religion were like real Civil Codes, as they were the best and easiest means to tell people how to live lives, rather than imposing laws.” 
 
 He was speaking at an event held at Govind Ramnath   of Law, Margao, to mark the inauguration of Centre for Lusophone Culture and Legal Studies.
 
 Speaking about the richness of the Portuguese language, Azevedo said Portuguese was once known as the language of diplomacy. Peace agreements were signed by Portugal with several local kingdoms, even in India, in the Portuguese language. The language, he said, is now considered to be a means of economic progress, as the knowledge of the language offers employment opportunities in many developed countries.
 
 Two memoranda of understanding were signed by the Kare College on the occasion – one with the School of Law of the  , and the other with Lusophone Society of Goa.
 
 Speaking on the occasion, Dario Moura Vicente, professor of law, University of Lisbon, said the Indo-Portuguese culture was “a part and parcel” of Indian society. Pointing out that it was an example of co-existence of different cultures,   underscored the need to preserve and strengthen it.
 
 Aurobindo Da Gama Xavier, president, Lusophone Society of Goa, also presented his views at the event. Principal of G R Kare College of Law, Saba Da Silva and chairman of   also spoke.
