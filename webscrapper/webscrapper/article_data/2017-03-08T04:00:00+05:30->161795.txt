Vadodara: As a tribute to International Women’s Day, the College of Physiotherapy at SSG Hospital will start women’s health physiotherapy OPD at the new college building from Wednesday. 

 The focus of the OPD will be on postural health for women, pregnancy and post-partum physiotherapy, menopause, osteoporosis and physiotherapy and pelvic floor health. 
 
 “Physiotherapists of our department already go the wards for patients management as per references from gynaecology and obstetrics department. But out patient department (OPD) for women’s health was never started. To mark health and wellness of women, we are starting the OPD,” said Dr Nilima Patel, principal and head of the College of Physiotherapy. 
 
 “The main interest is education and awareness programme with a holistic approach. We are going to take care of mental, physical, social, intellectual and spiritual health of women by physiotherapy guidelines, Yoga practices, counselling and awareness programmes,” she said. 
 
 As a part of the programme, the college is arranging a small ‘shibir’ in which it is expecting more than 100 women of different age groups to participate.
 
 The OPD will be inaugurated by MSU chancellor Shubhangini Raje Gaekwad and Vadodara MP Ranjan Bhatt. “The staff and students have collectively taken up the entire responsibility of starting this OPD and one well-wisher has contributed to its development at the initial stage,” she said. Patel added that women’s health physiotherapy is an important branch in physiotherapy.
