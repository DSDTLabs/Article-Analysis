It was widely reported that Sharad Yadav is displeased with Kumar's decision to dump the RJD and the Congress.
 
 Meanwhile, Lalu Prasad has extended an invitation to Yadav, urging him to lead the battle against the BJP in Bihar.
 
  
  
  
 
 On Saturday, Yadav had aimed another barb at the NDA government and its apparent non-performance.
 
 "Although government collects number of cesses in the name of different services from public, yet don't see any improvement in any area in the country," he had tweeted.
 
  
  
 
 JD(U)'s Rajya Sabha MPs Veerendra Kumar and Ali Anwar, who had openly criticised Nitish Kumarâ€™s move to break away from the grand alliance, had met with Yadav in Delhi.
