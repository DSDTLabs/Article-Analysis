Director-actor   will soon be playing the lead in a film by   Ramasamy. The film, like most of the director’s films, will be set in a village. “It is a rural thriller, which I haven’t titled yet. Samuthirakani will be playing the role of a straightforward villager. His character will be the silent type,with very little dialogue. And there will be no pair for him in the film,” reveals Seenu Ramasamy.

 The two National Award winners had previously worked together in Neerparavi. The director informs that discussions with Samuthirakani were going on for the past six months. However, he is still not sure when the film will go on floors, for he is also committed to Maamanithan, with Vijay Sethupathi, which will see maestro Ilaiyaraaja and his sons   and   composing together for the first time. “It all depends on Vijay Sethupathi’s dates once film shoots resume following this strike. I will shoot   first if I have Sethu’s dates, else take this up first while waiting for   to finish his other commitments. The script is all ready, and I can go to shoot any day,” he says.
