Selena  's make-up artist awkwardly referenced her love life in their joint Instagram video by joking she 'loves Canadians'. 

 The singer appeared with her make-up artist   in an Instagram video and they gave a shout out to their fans around the world. 
 
 When he suggests   she says to the camera "Hey Canada!" before Hung cheekily adds, "You know Selena loves Canadians". 
 
  
  
 Selena then ducks away from the camera as she responds with "Alright, alright" and a small chuckle before turning the camera off. 
 
 Hung's joke referenced her previous relationship with Canadian singer  , who she dated on and off between 2011 and 2014, and her current boyfriend, Canadian star The Weeknd, who she has been seeing since January.
