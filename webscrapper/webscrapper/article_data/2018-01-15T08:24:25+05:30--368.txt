 Police have also said that the area that had maximum intensity of fire was the back portion of the house on the ground floor. “Just closer to the backyard there are stairs that go to the first floor. Grandfather Mahendra had even attempted to go towards the first floor but he failed. Possibly he first had respiratory problems and later got grave burn injuries,” said a senior police officer. 
 
 The FSL report will also suggest the actual time when the house caught fire, but the police team who visited the spot believes fire must have started at 3.30 am and the family members got up in shock when the windowpanes shattered.

 “The girls along with their brothers decided to stay back along with their cousin due to kite flying. I have never witnessed a funeral procession of grandfather and his grandchildren,” said Dinesh Kanwat, a councillor of ward no 9 of JMC who too was with family since they arrived from Agra to witness the shock.
