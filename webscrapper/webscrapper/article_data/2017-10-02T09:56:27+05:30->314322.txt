MUMBAI: England gave a good account of their ability to go deep into the Under-17 World Cup when they defeated New Zealand 3-2 in their first practice game. More than their victory, it is their ability with the ball that impressed most at the   on Sunday.

 Rhian Brewster's two goals in the second half came after Marc Guehi had drawn England level in the early minutes. The game also offered decent insight into England's character because they came back from a goal down twice.
 
 The Kiwis opened the scoring from a counter attack when  's meaty shot from 20 yards out found the top right corner of the England goal. England struck immediately when captain Guehi scored from a cross. The Kiwis got ahead for the second time in the match when they struck in the 81st minute through Elijah Just. Again, almost immediately, England replied with a Rhian Brewster goal. A minute later Rhian leapt high to head in a routine cross to make it 3-2.
 
 England virtually fielded two sides and among the two, the first half team was clearly a class apart. Lead by Guehi in defence, England were solid in their backline and their midfielders,   and Nya Kirby were more than competent. But the real act was the understanding between Callum Hudson-Odoi and Emile Rowe.
 
 Callum and Emile created three goalscoring chances. The former was too quick and skilful for the New Zealand defence. His step-overs and rollovers were brilliant. New Zealand's right back   wilted in the stifling heat and humidity in his attempts to deal with Callum, who ripped him to shreds.
