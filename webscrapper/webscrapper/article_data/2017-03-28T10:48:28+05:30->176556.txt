 Yesterday's was only the latest in a series attacks on Africans and African students, in Delhi, Bengaluru and some other parts of the country.

 Yesterday, the death by drug overdose of a Class 12 student sparked protests in Greater Noida's Pari Chowk area in Uttar Pradesh, which led to the beating of the foreign students. 
 
 In keeping with the stereotype that "Nigerians sell drugs", police arrested five Nigerian students and later released them for lack of evidence. After they were released, the residents of the area where the Class 12 student lived, beat up four of them, saying the "Nigerians" were responsible for the Class 12 student's death. They also demanded all Africans living in residential colonies in Greater Noida be asked to vacate their rented houses immediately.
