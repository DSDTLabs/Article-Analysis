BENGALURU: Resort politics and horse trading is nothing new for Karnataka’s politicians. Introduced in the 1980s, during the reign of Ramakrishna Hegde, resort politics appears to now be part of the netas’ DNA. 

 
  troubleshooter   has selected a private resort in his backyard Bengaluru Rural to keep the Congress flock together.   sources said the Congress has activated four teams of its strongmen to operate at various levels to counter the BJP’s Operation Lotus.
 
 While Shivakumar, his brother D K Suresh and cousin S Ravi are keeping the band together, three other troubleshooter teams led by the Jarkiholi brothers, K C Venugopal and B Z Zameer Ahmed Khan have been assigned other tasks.
 
 The BJP is using its main men B Sreeramulu and the Ballari Reddy brothers, and chief minister B S Yeddyurappa’s confidante Shobha Karandlaje to seek out opposition MLAs.
 
 On Thursday, the proximity of the Jarkiholi brothers with the JD(S) was on display in front of Vidhana Soudha when   had a one-on-one public meeting with the regional party’s state president H D Kumaraswamy.
 
 With Satish being an ex-JD(S) MLA, the close relationship between him and Kumaraswamy has been used by the Congress to safeguard the alliance. Satish, who is the gobetween for the Congress and JD(S), has admitted that BJP is in touch with him and is attempting to lure him.
 
 Meanwhile, the suggestion that Congress MLAs should head to Kochi in Kerala is said to have been made by AICC general secretary and Alappuzha MP K C Venugopal.
 
 Venugopal, in tandem with JD(S) minister in the Left Democratic Front (LDF) Mathew T Thomas, is looking to band both parties in a location where the BJP cannot reach them.
 
 Perhaps the most thankless job has been handed to the team of Zameer Ahmed Khan — to track down missing MLAs like Anand Singh and bring them back into the fold.
