AHMEDABAD: The surge in   has persuaded the   to make   more effective. Recently,   were issued to police officials on night patrol to report their location at frequent intervals to the police  . This measure was put in place to ensure that all designated police personnel — from head constables and area PIs to zonal DCPs — were present on duty. “Directions have also been passed to police inspectors to verify police check points in their area during their night rounds,” said a senior police official.

  Recently, an area PI in the eastern part of the city paid a heavy prize for his lackadaisical approach to night patrol duties. According to police sources, about a fortnight ago, this senior police inspector was asked to give his location by an IPS officer. “The inspector gave him a location thinking that the IPS officer would not physically verify the claim,” said a police source. “However, the officer did show up at the location mentioned by the inspector and was surprised to find him missing.” Police sources said that on learning that the officer had arrived at the location, the inspector switched off his phone.
 
 The officer reported the misconduct to his superiors who have ordered an inquiry against the inspector, the source said. The inspector has been reprimanded several times for the rise in offences in his area.
