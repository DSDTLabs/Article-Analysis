Nagpur: A state-level committee on rehabilitation of tigers will decide the fate of captured   on Friday.

 Chairman of the committee APCCF N Rambabu has called a meeting of the committee at 11am at his office in Civil Lines.
 
 Other members of the committee Kishor Rithe, president of Satpuda Foundation, Dr NP Dakshinkar, dean of Nagpur Veterinary College, Dr AD Kholkute, retired wildlife vet, GK Vashishtha, divisional forest officer (DFO), honorary wildlife warden Kundan Hate, and CCF of Chandrapur Vijay Shelke will be present.
 
 The committee was constituted on May 31, 2016 by then PCCF (wildlife) Shree Bhagwan in the backdrop of release of hand-reared cubs TF1 & TF2 kept in an enclosure in Pench. These tigers have been sent to Borivali in Mumbai.
 
 The committee was also to prepare a SOP to minimize delays in release of reared cubs, re-wilding of cubs when they attain adulthood.
 
 Sources said the committee will study the papers of captured tigress T27-C1 and submit a report to PCCF (wildlife) AK Misra, who will then take a final call based on the committeeâ€™s recommendations.
 
 Meanwhile, the tigress is recovering from the shock and it consumed 4kg meat on Thursday. The injuries it suffered during transportation and capture are being treated upon. Bare minimum human presence is being sought near the tigress to curb imprints.
