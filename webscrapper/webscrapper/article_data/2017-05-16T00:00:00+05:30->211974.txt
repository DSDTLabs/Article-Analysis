In   (released in 1972), Dr   played the role of Rajeev, a man who visits his sister in the village only to find that she has lost her husband and is in financial trouble. He stays back to help her out. Years later, we now have  , wherein Shivarajkumar, son of Dr Rajkumar, plays the role of a man who visits his village to find a whole lot of issues concerning farmers and decides to stay back to help out. While the similarity in the story line ends right there, the director of the soon-to-be-released   film,  , has ensured that audiences get to see a lot more of the era gone by.

 
  
 
 “Our cast includes a lot of the bigwigs who were Dr Rajkumar’s peers, who play some of the main characters in the village that Shivarajkumar visits. So, you have Shivaram anna, Honnavalli Krishna, Kulli Jayamma, Srinivas Murthy, Srinath and  , who make up the main characters. Incidentally, all of them are Dr Rajkumar’s peers and have worked with him in various films at some point in their lives. While a few of them have remained active artistes in the industry, we had to go looking for some and sign them up for their roles. It is not only a piece of nostalgia, but also makes up a huge part that is the focus of story,” explains Yogi.
