BHAGALPUR: The   police seized a consignment of India-made foreign   from an underground septic tank of the toilet in a bootlegger’s house in Paasitola locality under the Ishakchak police station area on Friday evening. 

 Sources in the office of Bhagalpur SSP   said at least 1,131 bottles of India-made foreign liquor was seized made from the septic tank in the house of Gama   while hundreds of litres of country liquor was dumped into the locality’s drains by occupants of the adjoining houses before they escaped even before the police raid.
 
 Police also arrested Choudhary, who is suspected to a member of an inter-state gang involved in smuggling of liquor from neighbouring Jharkhand and   to dry Bihar. Police said the gang members would supply liquor to targeted customers at a premium with the help of children and women. 
 
 A police officer told TOI Friday’s raid was conducted following the revelations made by four suspended cops, who were earlier on Thursday arrested for boozing inside a police outpost near the Bhagalpur railway station.
