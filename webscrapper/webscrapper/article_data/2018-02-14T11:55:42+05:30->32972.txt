HYDERABAD: For Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's tour of India, Iran's secret security personnel will take complete control of all security arrangements for the president. 

 Iranian authorities told local police that keeping in view the threat from various quarters, they wanted the Indian security establishment to give highest priority to Rouhani's security. 
 
 Rouhani will visit   on February 16, where all security personnel, including   police will be in mufti inside the mosque. 
 
 A high-level security meeting of Intelligence Bureau (IB), Telangana police and Iran security agencies was held on Tuesday. 
 
 In the last two days, members of Ministry of Intelligence of Iran visited   fort,   tombs and   Masjid. As Charminar pedestrianisation work is under way, Rouhani will not visit the monument. He will enter the masjid via Lad Bazar. He will be accompanied by a 50-member contingent. 
 
 Rouhani will be residing at Taj Krishna for the full duration of his two-day visit. He will land at Begumpet Airport on Thursday. He has a hectic schedule on Friday, as he starts his day by visiting Golconda fort followed by Qutub Shahi tombs before heading to Mecca Masjid, where he will be offering noon prayers, followed by his speech. He will hold several meeting with Shia religious heads at Taj Krishna too. 
 
  Out of the three tier security, Telangana police will be in tier II and subsequent layers, while the main security will be handled by Iranian Intelligence with assistance from   sleuths. 
 
 "Rouhani will be at Golconda and Qutub Shahi tombs for 45 minutes each. However, in Mecca masjid, he will spend nearly two hours. 
 
 A large number of Shia community members are expected to be there. While Rouhani visits Mecca Masjid,traffic restrictions will be imposed," a top source in Telangana police said.
