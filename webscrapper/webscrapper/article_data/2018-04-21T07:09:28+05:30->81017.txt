BATHINDA: Former   MLA Harminder Singh Jassi's nephew Bhupinder Singh   has been expelled from the primary membership of the Aam Aadmi Party. Gora has been accused of indulging in anti-party activities.

 Balbir said Gora was making unnecessary comments without the approval of the party and was also issuing statements against the senior leaders, which was not acceptable so his membership of the party had been terminated. 
 
 He said the decision to expel Gora was taken in a meeting of zonal presidents Anil Thakur, Gurditt Singh Sekhon, Dalbir Singh Dhillon, Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal, Paramjeet Singh Sachdeva, organizational building in charge Garry Birring and treasurer Sukhwinder Pal Sukhi.
 
 Gora was not available for comments despite repeated attempts to reach him.
 
 His uncle is known for his proximity to Dera Sacha Sauda, Sirsa and his daughter is married to  's son.
