Actor and model   was in Gurgaon recently when she took some time off her schedule for a shoot with Gurgaon Times. Sana, who was in the city for an event, told us that she has been to the Millennium City many times before, but has never had the chance to explore it. "I haven't explored Gurgaon yet. Whenever I come here, I am usually here for shoots. Since it is near to the airport, I prefer to stay here. But I haven't had the time to explore this place, as I am usually here for work, so I travel from the airport to the hotel and then go back. However, whatever I have seen seems very corporate and organized. When I was in Cyber City recently, the place looked very organized. Bahut hi corporate sa lag raha tha. I think the area also has a lot of places to offer for partying," she told us.

 While Sana may not have had the time to explore Gurgaon, she has seen some parts of Delhi. "As far as Delhi is concerned, I have been to   when I was a kid. I have been to the   and I have memories of  , especially of the  . I clearly remember that I went there with my family before our first trip to Ajmer. You are expected to visit the dargah before leaving for Ajmer. One thing that I really like about Delhi is that one side of the city is really developed and the other side gives you a very historical feel," she added.
