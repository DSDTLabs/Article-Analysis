CHENNAI: Visitors to the Rail Museum on   will be able to spot a 13-foot long, nine-foot high, bull from next week. Made of metal, not flesh and blood, it is a creation of artist P Elanchezhiyan, 37, who carved it out of tonnes of metallic scrap from the   (ICF), the country’s premier railway coach manufacturing unit.

 The work symbolises the strength of the ICF and its workforce, which churns out thousands of railway coaches every year. “ICFis a giganticorganisation and the metal bull signifies that,” Elanchezhiyan said.
 
 
 Sculptors and other artists like  , AV Illango and   have been invitedby railwayofficials at ICF to reimagine the space in a fresh manner, which is unprecedented in the Indian Railways, saidtop officials.
 
 The initiative was undertaken by ICF general manager S Mani after he saw big piles of scrap metal lying on the shop floor during inspections. Instead of throwing it away or auctioning itfor money, hedecided tooffer the metal to artists. And to their credit, they have transformedtheRailMuseum into a thriving spacefor modern art.
 
 The museum is now a spot for weekend getaways, school trips and learning sessions for budding engineers. It displays photographs showing the transformation of Indian Railways since independence,  , including vintage ones and a toytrain ride for kids. Inside, an air-conditioned art gallery has been created, where painters have created abstract art portraitsof thebond sharedby the Railways withIndia’s citizens.
