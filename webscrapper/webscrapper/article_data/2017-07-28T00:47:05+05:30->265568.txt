New Delhi: With   heading for   on August 23, hectic campaigning has begun. 

 The seat was left vacant after the AAP legislator quit the party to join BJP in March. BJP has declared Prakash as its candidate, upsetting former MLA Gugan Singh Ranga who would now either join BSP or contest as an independent. Prakash was with BJP before joining AAP ahead of the 2015 elections. But he quit AAP too, claiming that the leadership was out of sync with ground realities. 
 
 “We started work in the constituency since the day Prakash resigned. Senior party members have been focusing their energies there with the CM also having visited the constituency. Door-to-door campaigning has been taking place since the past several weeks and two rounds have been completed. We are confident of winning the seat,” said a senior member. 
 
 AAP is fielding Ramchander who was earlier with BSP. He had contested from this seat in 2008 and got 18,000 votes. Three-time MLA Surender Kumar would represent Congress. 
 
 AAP’s stakes are high in this, having just lost the Rajouri Garden bypoll to BJP. Congress has been hoping for a good show too, especially after its increased vote share in the municipal elections. But Gugan’s entry might upset everybody’s equations.
