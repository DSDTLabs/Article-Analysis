CHANDIGARH: Leader of opposition and senior INLD leader   on Sunday demanded a white paper concerning details of all foreign jaunts of chief minister  .

 Addressing mediapersons, Abhay accused the BJP government and Khattar of making misleading and false promises about the foreign direct investment (FDI) as his foreign visits failed to bring the investments as claimed by the CM and his team. “Soon after every foreign tour, the government has touted about the number of MoUs signed as also the number of job opportunities that would be created for the youth of  , hence we are forced to demand white paper from him as well as the government,” he said.
 
 Even as Haryana was burning as a consequence of the government’s inept handling of the Jat reservation agitation, the government organized Happening Haryana Summit in Gurgaon, where it was claimed that MoUs committing FDI of Rs 5.5 lakh crore had been signed. It had also claimed that lakhs of jobs would be created as a consequence but no such development became a reality, he added.
 
 Abhay also accused the state government of shielding Haryana Subordinate Staff Selection Commission (HSSSC) and its suspended chairman  . “Despite the fact that eight persons have been arrested and there is a suspicion of involvement of members and certain higher-ups in the cash-for-job scam, but the CM as well as the government continue to defend the ex-chairman,” he said. In the same breath, he also accused the BJP of disturbing communal harmony as well as caste wars for political gains.
 
 Referring to Thursday’s incident of a man throwing black oil on CM Manohar Lal Khattar in Hisar, Chautala blamed it on Kuldeep Bishnoi and accused him of resorting to cheap tactics to defame the INLD. “The person was Bishnoi’s voting and counting agent and had been posting his photographs with him. All this was done to defame INLD,” Abhay said.
