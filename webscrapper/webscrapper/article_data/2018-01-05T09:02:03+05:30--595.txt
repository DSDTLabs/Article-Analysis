Jaipur: People in rural areas have become more aware of protecting bovines, and this is the reason why the police are cracking the whip on cow smuggling, said state home minister Gulab Chand   on Thursday.

 He claimed that   has not witnessed a single incident in which a dairy farmer has been killed in any kind of violence. He also claimed that   crimes have fallen under the   government, so far.
 
 Kataria was speaking to the media at his office at the state secretariat. He said the government along with the police was taking stern action against brutal crimes.
 
 Asked on the proactive approach of the police against cow smuggling, Kataria said, “Police will take action only when such matters come to notice. Likewise, people these days are more aware. Anyone who is transporting cows with valid papers, permissions and documents need not fear violence.”
 
 He added that the registered IPC crimes were 1,51,174 when BJP left power in 2008. By 2013, this figure had climbed to 1,96,224. “The crime graph increased during the   regime and our government is successful in bringing down crimes against women and crime against SC/ST. Also whenever heinous crimes took place, the police took stringent action and booked culprits,” he said.
 
 Commenting specifically on the Rajsamand’s ‘hate’ murder, he said, “I am personally monitoring the case. Police have already made a strong case and the chargesheet will be filed soon in the matter.”
 
 Asked if communal harmony has been disturbed in the state during the BJP rule, he said, “Wherever such problems took place due to some dispute over cremation ground of Muslims and funeral ground of Hindus or during religious processions, the police have dealt with them strictly. We have arrested lawbreakers irrespective of their caste, creed and religion.”
 
 Kataria also pointed to the newly-introduced grading system in police stations for helping to reduce crimes.
