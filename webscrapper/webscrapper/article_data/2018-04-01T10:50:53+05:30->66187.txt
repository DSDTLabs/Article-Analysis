NAGPUR: As the   paperleak and re-exam drama unfolded on media for the last couple of days, certain city parents and principals felt a sense of déjà vu. In 2011, when the first Std X batch passed out under   pattern, thousands of students in   were refused admissions to state junior colleges because they appeared for school-based exam. 

 Parent Manjot  , who was a core member of Aggrieved Parents Forum set up back then, said, “CBSE had left us in the lurch, at a time when we needed them the most.” With no official representative in entire state, parents had no where else to go. 
 
 Singh, said, “We realized quickly that no help could be expected from CBSE as there was no one who was addressing our concerns. We approached schools, politicians and even threatened with a mass hunger strike before things finally started moving. Local politicians and some school owners threw their weight behind us and only after that CBSE started speaking for us.”
 
 Well known environmentalist Poonam Dhanwatay’s child too was in the 2011 batch and she agrees that CBSE’s image has taken a beating. “It’s true that CBSE left parents to fend for themselves. We had to approach bureaucrats, cabinet ministers and even the chief minister Prithviraj Chavhan to get our voices heard. Students then approached the court because both state and central education boards were not coordinating among themselves,” she said. 
 
 For schools too it was a harrowing time recalled a principal, who did not wish to be identified. “We were stuck in the middle because parents blamed us at one end while at the other CBSE wasn’t solving our problem. We expected more from CBSE at that particular time,” she said. 
 
 To resolve the issue, apart from the parents’ tireless efforts, a final push came from the then cabinet minister  , then education minister   and the late NKP Salve who was based in Delhi at that time.
