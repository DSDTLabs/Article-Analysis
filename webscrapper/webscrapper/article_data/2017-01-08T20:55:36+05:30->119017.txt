AGRA: While chief minister   has claimed the support of more than 90 per cent of Samajwadi Party MLAs, MLCs and MPs in Uttar Pradesh, his namesakes literally outnumber his father's’ on the voters’ list.
 
 According to the  , there are 1,986 Akhilesh Yadavs on the voters’ list, compared to only 326 named  .
  
 In Azamgarh itself, under which Mulayam’s own parliamentary constituency falls, there are 330 Akhilesh Yadavs, and only six Mulayam Singh Yadavs.
  
 Interestingly, data from electoral rolls available with the EC further revealed that Etawah, birthplace of both Mulayam and Akhilesh did not have anyone else sharing their names registered as voters.
  
 According to the EC, the most number of Akhilesh Yadavs were from Azamgarh, followed by Ghazipur (116), Jaunpur (113), Ballia (108), Lucknow (106) and Gorakhpur (102). The highest number of Mulayams were from Allahabad (43), Lucknow (41), Pratapgarh (34), Barabanki (30), Kanpur city (24) and Bhadohi (14).
  
 District such as Amethi, Auraiya, Baghpat, Budaun, Bulandshahr, Mathura, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Shahjahanpur, Amroha, Bijnor, Hapur and Shamli did not have any namesakes of the two.
  
 For the namesakes, the current political upheaval in the ruling party is for the most part a distant event except when someone points out their names. In Agra, Mulayam Singh Yadav, a rickshaw puller, said he was resolutely apolitical but had very strong views about the Yadav clan feud in the SP. “It is not morally right for a son to dethrone his father to take control of an empire or a political party,” he said.
