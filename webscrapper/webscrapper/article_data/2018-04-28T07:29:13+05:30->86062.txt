HYDERABAD: A day after TOI reported that the family of a co-option member of the   ( ), G  , had erected two statues of her 17-year-old son who died seven months ago, the authorities sprung into action and removed the statues.

 In clear violation of   orders, the statues of G Akhil Goud came up over the last 10 days alongside the Alwal Main Road and Old Awal Crossroads respectively.
 
  
  
 GHMC officials said they have removed the statues. “We wanted to remove them by the end of this month with the help of police. But, we have done that now,” said E  , GHMC assistant city planner of Alwal.

 Appreciating GHMC’s move, the residents said the removal of statues was necessary for seamless traffic movement. “The statue on Alwal main road was obstructing the free flow of traffic and removing the statues also ensured that the law is above all,” said PM Sai Prasad, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) leader and RTI activist, who resides in Alwal.
 
 Speaking to TOI,  , husband of G Jyothi Goud, had agreed to remove the statues if it was causing traffic problems. “I was not aware that erecting my son’s statue, who was part of Telangana struggle since childhood, will create problem for movement of traffic. I will shift them inside the compound wall of our establishment,” said G Srinivas Goud, who also shared pictures of his son participating in rallies and programmes held for Telangana movement.
