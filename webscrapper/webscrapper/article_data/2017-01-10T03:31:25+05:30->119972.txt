THANE: The son of   Bhavsinh Rathod from Gujarat, Kishoresinh, has been reportedly arrested from   in   in the Rs 2,000-crore  . Kishoresinh, one of the prime accused in the case, had been absconding and was arrested by the Gujarat ATS. 

 In April last year, the police had seized 18,627 kg of ephedrine, a medicine abused to make party drug Crystal Meth, worth over Rs 2,000 crore following a raid in Thane and at a Solapur pharma manufacuturing firm. Kishoresinh had turned elusive since his name cropped up in a drugs deal that involved a cartel from South Africa, former actress   and her partner Vicky Goswami.
 
 The Thane police is understood to have sent a requisition letter to the Gujarat police seeking Rathod’s custody.
 
 Parag Manere, the deputy commissioner of police (crime), said that a team of Thane crime branch as well as Gujarat ATS had launched a massive manhunt for Kishoresinh. 
 
 “We have learnt that Rathod was arrested by the Gujarat ATS late on Sunday from Chambal Valley on the border of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. We shall seek his custody at the earliest to probe his role in the drugs seizure case,” Manere said. 
 
 Kishoresinh is also an accused in the Rs 270-crore ephedrine seizure from a factory on the outskirts of Ahmedabad last year. He had allegedly been running a drug racket with the help of Jay Mukhi, Punit Sringi and Manoj Jain who is the former director of the Solapur pharma company, said a police officer.
