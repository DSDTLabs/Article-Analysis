PATNA: The state’s health department is unable to meet the contraception need of nearly 40 lakh of couples in the state. Saran (26.2%), Sheohar (26.2%), Samastipur (25.6%), Siwan (25.2%), Kishanganj (24.9%) and Gopalganj (24.5%) are the six districts with the maximum unmet need for contraception.

 “As per the   (FP2020) data hosted by United Nations Foundation, nearly 41% of the population in   has an unmet demand for modern contraceptive methods. This is the highest in the country. The programme as is being run is not substantial,” said Dr S K Sikdar, deputy commissioner of family planning division under the Union health ministry while speaking at a family planning review workshop organized here on Saturday following the Supreme Court directive in October 2016 on a writ petition No. 95/2012 (Devika Biswas Vs Union of India). The PIL had highlighted a case of gross negligence in 2012 at a sterilization camp in Araria where 53 women were operated by a single surgeon in torchlight at a school building that lacked even running water facility.
 
 The FP report also highlighted the lack of awareness about contraception. “Modern contraceptive use is negligible in West Champaran (3.9%), East Champaran (5.5%), Saran (8%), Gopalganj (8.9%), Muzaffarpur (9.2%) and Siwan (9.4%). Female sterilization in Bihar has also dropped from 5,13,816 in 2014-15 to 2,90,804 in 2017-18. Similarly, male sterilization has also dropped from 3,498 in 2014-15 to 1,594 in 2017-18,” Dr Sikdar said.
 
 Cited the Health Management Information System (HMIS) report of the Centre, he said there were 5,11,838 sterilization cases in Bihar in 2016-17 with three deaths, 24 failures and 131 complications. 
 
 Talking about high-risk pregnancies, Dr Sikdar said there were 12.2% teenage births in Bihar, which is the third highest among 20 states in the country after West Bengal (18.3%) and Assam (13.6%).
 
 “Out of the annual 30 lakh births in the state, approximately 3.5 lakh are teenage births, leading to maternal and infant mortality as well as morbidity. Another factor of high-risk birth is less than three years of gap in conceiving. Bihar has the lowest spacing time duration (44.4%) with approximately 15 lakh high-risk pregnancies, compared to the national average of 51.9%,” he said.
 
 State health minister Mangal Pandey, who was present at the workshop, directed the officials concerned to make all the health centres functional by April end. He also directed the civil surgeons to review two primary health centres once a month. All chief medical officers were also instructed to review two sub-health centres once a month.
