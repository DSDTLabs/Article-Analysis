HYDERABAD: A day after Intermediate student   was hacked to death on the Kukatpally main road, the Cyberabad   arrested three youths, including a vegetable vendor, on Tuesday.

 Police said the killing was a fallout of a bitter rivalry between two gangs. Police also said that they were checking if the accused or the victim’s friends had formed gangs in Moosapet to foment trouble.
 
 The arrested were J   (19), vegetable vendor, his associates B Naveen (20), painter, and B Shiva (21), a degree student, while a manhunt is on to nab two others — K Teja and I Krishna. In fact, Naveen was picked up at the crime spot by head constable Prabhakar and Anjilayya, home guard. “The head constable and the home guard risked their lives and caught Naveen. They will be rewarded suitably,” Kukatpally ACP N  , who is heading the investigation, said.
 
 Police said it all began with a fracas between Sudheer and a friend of Krishna at   grounds in Moosapet on March 9 over threats to Sudheer’s father. After the fight, Krishna assaulted Sudheer.
 
 In the meantime, Sudheer’s brother Prasad came to know about the assault and went to the neighbourhood of Krishna where he chanced upon his friend Naveen. After a heated argument, Prasad assaulted Naveen and challenged their gang leader Mahesh to meet him at the Goods Shed Road in Moosapet to settle the matter.
 
 “When Mahesh came there, Prasad, Sudheer and their friends pounced on Mahesh. Ever since, Mahesh bore a grudge and hatched a plot along with his gang members to eliminate Sudheer,” police said. A case in connection with the assault was registered at Kukatpally police station.
 
 Mahesh, Naveen and Teja purchased hunting sickles for Rs 450 on March 10 and sought the help of Shiva, Sudheer’s neighbour, to inform them about the latter’s movements. On Monday morning, Mahesh and the accused hacked Sudheer to death.
