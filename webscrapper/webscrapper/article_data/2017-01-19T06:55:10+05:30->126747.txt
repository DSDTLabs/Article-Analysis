HYDERABAD: US citizen James   arrested on Tuesday for circulating   on Internet, is probably the first in India to be put behind bars under Information Technology (IT) Act. Jones, a linguistics expert at an MNC law firm in Hyderabad, was booked for sharing tera bytes of pornographic content among peers.

 Jones was nabbed after a honey-trap operation by   officials. After sleuths noticed circulation of child pornography from Jones' twitter account, they posed as child porn enthusiasts and lured him to send a huge collection of child porn videos. This way they picked up his IP address details, which were shared with Indian police.
 
 Telangana police will now write to Interpol and also scan his online peers' list to identify if any were operating from India. Police also informed the MNC law firm in Madhapur, where Jones was employed and the US consulate about his arrest. Jones has a valid visa till December and they are yet to find evidence to indicate he was indulging in physical abuse of children in Hyderabad.
 
 “Jones' domestic help told us he did not misbehave with her and analysis of CCTV foo tage near his Madha pur house also confir med no children were visiting his place," said a   (CID) offi cial. Jones has been lodged at   central prison along with other remand prisoners.
 
 Hyderabad police were also shocked to find the accused is an American citizen. “Jones began downloading and sharing child porn videos after he came to India five years ago.The laws in US were strict so he used to act discretely there.But after coming to India he freely started purchasing, downloading and sharing child porn, thinking that Indian law enforcement agencies cannot catch him,“ a police official said.
