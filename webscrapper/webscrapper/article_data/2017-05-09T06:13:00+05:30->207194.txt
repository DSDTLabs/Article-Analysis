NAGPUR: The much awaited recognition of two post graduate (PG) seats in the   subject at the Government Medical College and Hospital ( ) from the   (MCI) has finally come. The   had de-recognized the course in 2014 after finding major deficiencies of equipment and staff in the department in the college.

 The seats have been recognized from back date since 2014. Though the college is yet to get a letter from the MCI in this regard the MCI website is displaying its recognition. But these seats have come temporarily with a rider that the college fulfils all the deficiencies of staff and equipment pointed out by the Council which include a “linear accelerator’ as one of the most important equipment. The college as yet only has a cobalt unit in the name of equipment for radiation therapy for the cancer patients. But the college now has the required teaching staff as its biggest strength for retaining the course.
 
 Interestingly GMCH happens to be the only college in the government sector in entire   with a PG degree course in radiotherapy. GMCH had got the course sanctioned after a persistent effort of 20 years in 2011 by the former head of the department Dr Krishna Kamble.
 
 But unfortunately due to state apathy GMCH has never been given the due importance and status by the state government as a part of the overall indifference towards Vidarbha. The cancer institute project of Rs120 crore which is expected to bring all the major equipment like linear accelerator is in doldrums.
