CHENNAI: BJP Rajya Sabha member   on Wednesday said it is the duty of   Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao to swear in   general secretary VK   as chief minister as she had the support of MLAs.

 Swamy was speaking to a news channel on the latest developments in Tamil Nadu where caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam has come out in open rebellion against Sasikala.
 
 "Governor cannot sit in Maharashtra when such a political crisis is happening in Tamil Nadu," Swamy told CNN-News18 in an interview.
 
 Swamy also said Sasikala was close to Jayalalithaa and the latter had taken many decisions to please Sasikala. 
 
 "In the many years I've known Jayalalithaa as friend and enemy, I know that she thought of OPS as a rubber stamp," he said.
