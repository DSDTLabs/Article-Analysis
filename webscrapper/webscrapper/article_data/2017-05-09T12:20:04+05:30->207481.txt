 Dr Goyal said: “NEET is the only relevant exam practically for all MBBS and BDS admissions in the country .Many times, the examiners frame the questions in the NCERT-textbook language that itself is full of errors.It's not the first time that a competitive examination had ambiguous questions and the board asked to award candidates grace marks for it.
 
 “ He has appealed the CBSE to be flexible. “Have experts review these questions and adjust the answer key ,“ he said. Dr Arvind Goyal, a city based competition coach, said, “Passing off an ambiguous question as correct will propagate the wrong idea among the future students and teachers.“ The candidates were worried.Medical aspirant Niti Garg said: “Of the multiple choices for an answer, two seemed correct but we were required to mark only one. I hope the CBSE will take note and mark us accordingly .“
 
 The students and the experts now wait for the answer key to be out. “We will see what answer has been marked correct and raise objections, if need be,“ said  , father of a candidate.
