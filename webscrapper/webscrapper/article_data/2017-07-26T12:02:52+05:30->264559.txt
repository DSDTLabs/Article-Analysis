LUDHIANA: Meharban police on Monday brought the infamous gangster, Dharminder Singh alias Gugni, on a production warrant. According to sources in the police department, Gugni was planning some conspiracy from inside the Central Jail, Ludhiana, for which he asked his accomplice Parampreet Singh alias Godly to get a pistol. This was revealed when the   (CIA-I) Goldy was caught on July 6 with the pistol.

 Goldy revealed that he had bought the pistol on the instruction of Gugni, who was planning some conspiracy from inside the jail. Gugni was arrested from a checkpoint in village   in 2014. Police had recovered a pistol of .32 bore and three live cartridges from Gugniâ€™s possession. On 13 November 2011, the Gugni gang and Sandeep Khwajke gang indulged in a scuffle at a marriage function near Kohara. During firing between both the groups, Surinder Singh (an accomplice of Khwajke) was shot dead. In that case, the police booked Gugni, Amandeep Singh alias Kala Havas (who died in a gang war), and Goldy. 
 
 SHO at Meharban police station, inspector Pavitar Singh, said Gugni had been brought on a production warrant to know why he approached Goldy from inside the jail, and why he asked him (Goldy) to get a pistol. The interrogation will reveal whether some conspiracy was being hatched.
