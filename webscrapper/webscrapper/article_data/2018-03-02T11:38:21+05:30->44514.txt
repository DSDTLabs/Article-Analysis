BHOPAL: After announcing sops for farmers in the state budget, the BJP has decided to celebrate chief minister  's birthday as 'Kisan Sewa Divas' on March 5. 

 On Wednesday, the government had announced Rs 37,498 crore for agriculture and related activities, including Rs 2,745 crore as state share in central schemes, for farmers which is almost 87% higher than last year. To publicise the benefits, BJP   is planning a series of programmes in each district. "We are celebrating chief minister's birthday on March 5 as 'Kisan Sewa Divas' across the state. Farmer conventions, group meetings and block-level seminars will be held to make the peasants aware of the welfare schemes, and plans to double their income", said state Kisan Morcha president Ranvir Singh Rawat.
 
 Sources said the saffron party had earlier announced to organise   in each district to create awareness about farm welfare programmes and involve peasants in government's pro-farmer decisions. However, the Morcha failed to reap any benefit as the rallies could not be organised in several blocks. Party workers also remained restricted to their district headquarters, failing to reach rural areas with the welfare schemes. Confusion among BJP workers over Bhawantar scheme also played spoilsport at many places, sources said. 
 
 As part of the celebrations, BJP workers would reach out to farm households, contact beneficiaries of crop insurance and Bhawantar schemes to observe the day. The saffron party has assigned duties to all members of morchas, cells and related bodies. The publicity campaign would highlight chief minister's contribution in bringing happiness to each family, Rawat said.
