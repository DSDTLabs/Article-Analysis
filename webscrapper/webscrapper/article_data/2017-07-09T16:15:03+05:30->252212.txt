There's nothing like old jodis making a comeback.   and   -who have gifted Bengali cinema many gems -will soon be seen in  's Basu Paribar. They had a script reading session recently and the film will hit the floors next month. Suman, who spends most part of the year in Florida, is trying to familiarise the actors with each other and with him. The cast, too, seems to be taking the `paribar' seriously and is going all out to make the shooting floor feel like home.So, it didn't come as a surprise when Mrs Sen insisted that her room in Mahishadal Rajbari should resemble her Kolkata apartment. She requested that some of her essentials, like her writing table, be transported to the location. The list also includes some of her favourite masks that make her feel at home. Truly , home is where the heart is.
