  : Bringing down the curtains on the uncertainty as to who would execute the   project works, CM   on Thursday said that   company will take over the works at the project site from the first week of February. 

 He said Navayuga had agreed to take up the works at the existing rates. Transstroy was the contractor ever since the works began and the CM was livid with the slow pace of works till now. He wants to complete Polavaram before 2019 elections as the project is a major   plank for him.
