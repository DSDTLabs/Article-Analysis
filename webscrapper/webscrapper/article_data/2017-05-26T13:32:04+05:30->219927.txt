Director   has a sense of humour if his social media account is anything to go by. Only recently, Riteish Deshmukh, in a bid to promote his film that's based on a robbery, photoshopped a poster of Srijit directorial debut Begum Jaan, putting his own face in place of  's. The outcome, admittedly hilarious, didn't miss Srijit's eyes on Twitter and he couldn't help but laugh out loud at the blatant 'chori' and the creative spin to it! 

  
  
  
  
 Bollywood's funnyman Chunky Panday too participated in the joke...
 
  
  
 
  
  
 Riteish didn't stop at that. He went on to spoof the posters of some of the hit movies and the results are hilarious! Check them out...
