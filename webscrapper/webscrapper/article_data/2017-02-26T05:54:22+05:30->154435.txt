CHENNAI: Terming the decision of Karnataka government to construct a reservoir across river Cauvery near Mekedatu as unilateral, chief minister   on Saturday requested Prime Minister   to instruct the water resources ministry not to accord clearance to the project until judicial references were settled. 

 Palaniswami, in a letter to Modi, referred to recent reports in the media that Karnataka government had decided to implement the 5,912 crore Mekedatu multipurpose (drinking water and power) project across the river Cauvery that involves building a reservoir with a capacity of 66tmcft and said it would affect   badly. 
 
 Palaniswami urged the PM to instruct the ministry of water resources, river development and the Central water commission not to accord techno-economic clearance for Mekedatu or any other project in the Cauvery basin of Karnataka till the concurrence of all co-basin states were obtained by Karnataka government.
