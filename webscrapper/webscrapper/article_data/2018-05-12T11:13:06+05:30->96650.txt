CHANDIGARH: Age has again become a cause of disagreement for the post of the director principal at the   ( ), Sector 32, Chandigarh. Few faculty members recently went to the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) challenging the decision of the UT administration which approved 58 years as the upper age limit for the post. Recently, the department of personnel and training had accepted the upper age limit for the post as 58 years. Prior to this, the upper age limit was 56 years, which was revised as 59 years in a notification by the UPSC. Consequently, there is a delay in the appointment of a regular director principal in the college since more than a year now. 

 Dr Jasbinder Kaur from Biochemistry department, along with other faculty members, filed a case in CAT challenging the recruitment rules. The hearing of the case is on May 28. "The recruitment rules of the college is based on the   government and nothing can amend it," said a faculty. 
 
 There are five government medical colleges in Punjab and thus the posts of the director and the principal are separate. Also, there is no upper age limit for the director or the principal as the senior most faculty is eligible for the post. 
 
 The faculty had the age limit enhanced to 59 years after they had sent a representation to the governor, UT. That time the upper age limit was 56 years. "But now after the governor again revised the age to 58 years instead of 59 years, the faculty have challenged it and not accepted it. They are reasoning that there should be no age limit on the pattern of Punjab medical colleges," said an official in the UT health department. 
 
 Sources however feel it as a strategy to dilly dally the selection of a regular director.
