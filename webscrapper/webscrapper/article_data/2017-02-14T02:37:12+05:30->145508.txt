In an exclusive interview to TOI immediately after meeting the media,   CEO   on Monday described a whistleblower's letter as “a direct, reckless, malicious, slanderous and personal attack on me by diabolical minds. I will not tolerate it. It is unacceptable. If somebody attacks me personally, we will follow whatever legal recourse we have to.”

 The letter, a copy of which is in TOI’s possession, alleges that former chief financial officer   was paid a massive Rs 17.4 crore as severance in exchange for his silence on certain accounting practice and an overseas acquisition.
 
 Asked about co-founder N R Narayana Murthy’s statement that he would like someone like the US-based finance professor   as a co-chair Infosys chairman  , who also spoke with TOI, said, “He has conveyed it to the public. It is for us to say whether Marti is the right person, or somebody else is the right person. We have to take a decision; we will take the decision in the interest of shareholders at large.”
