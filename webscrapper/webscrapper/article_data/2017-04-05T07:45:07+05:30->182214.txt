NAGPUR: “National Council of Science Museums (NCSM) has done commendable work in helping other countries, including Australia, develop such centres and India is far ahead of others in the field,” said  , director of   (RSC), on Tuesday.

 Delivering a lecture on ‘40 years of NCSM: A journey’, Iyer said like RSC, science centres were set up across the country, the last being in 2001. “Though no such centre came up since then, Palampur is set to get one in the next few years. Not much significant progress was made by NCSM for the last 16 years due to some reason or the other. Staff crunch was also another problem faced by science centres,” he added. NCSM comes under the union ministry of culture which set up RSC.
 
 Narrating the journey, he said, “Science museums were initially built in Europe and Germany. In India, the process to build such museums began in 1959 when NCSM sent Amalendu Bose, a student, to Germany to study how they functioned. Later, the first science museum was built in Bengal and Bose was made its director. I had an opportunity to work with Bose.”
 
 Iyer said,   (NSC), the second in the series, came into being at Mumbai in 1987. While inaugurating NSC, the then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi announced that more such centres would be built across the country to promote science. Since then, NCSM has set up 25 science centres, some at the national and others at the regional and sub-regional levels. RSC is a regional centre.
 
 As part of the celebrations, RSC had organized various activities which were attended by over 50 school students. The activities included screening of a film on ‘Life and works of JC Bose’, followed by ‘Science vs Fiction’ in which students were shown demonstration of various techniques which they earlier believed was a fiction.
