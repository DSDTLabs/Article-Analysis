Nagpur: Directing the Maharashtra State Security Corporation (MSSC) to deploy its security at the Central Museum (Ajab Bangla), the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday disposed of the suo motu PIL.

 A division bench comprising justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Swapna Joshi asked the commissioner of police here to continue deployment of two police constables at the museum, till MSSC takes over the security.
 
 The suo motu litigation was admitted on the media report, which highlighted worsening conditions of the Central Museum that was once pride for the city, owing to the government’s lethargy. The report mentioned that priceless artefacts were said to be lying in open outside the building. Deven Chauhan was then appointed as amicus curiae to plead PIL. 
 
 The judges earlier asked the curator to apply for MSSC within two weeks and latter was told to deploy security in next four weeks.
 
 During last hearing, Chauhan pointed out that museum’s security was highly inadequate to preserve artefacts and jewellery in the museum.
 
 The court then asked the Maharashtra government to secure funds of Rs3 lakh for electrification of the heritage gallery.
 
 Earlier, the amicus curiae pointed out that the museum and artefacts were not given attention since many years which led to their decay. He further added that precious artefacts were lying outside the building and irreparable damage was being caused to whatever left with the museum. Subsequently, all this has reduced this historic monument into a pale shadow of itself.
