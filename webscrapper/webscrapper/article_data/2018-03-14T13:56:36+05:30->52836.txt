BJP state president   said it was not necessary to fill the vacuum in   politics by cinema actors. 

 Speaking to reporters after a public meeting in Erode city on Tuesday,   said there were many Tamil cinemas struggling to get released. “Instead of taking steps to release them and talk about the issues being faced by the cine industry,   leader   is talking politics,” she said. BJP is the only party which is actively working for people, she said. “But, Kamal Haasan is saying that the BJP is anti-people,” she said.
 
 On Kurangani forest fire incident, Tamilisai appreciated the central government and Union defence minister   for immediately sending choppers from Sulur air station in Coimbatore to rescue the victims. “I appreciate for saving several people who were stuck in the forest fire. At the same time, I am saddened for not able to save 11 lives,” she said. She stressed the need for creating special wards in primary health centres and other government hospitals to treat burn injury patients across the state. 
 
 Tamilisai said BJP is ready to face assembly election and the local body election at any time. “Assembly election in Tamil Nadu could come at any time,” she said. TNN
