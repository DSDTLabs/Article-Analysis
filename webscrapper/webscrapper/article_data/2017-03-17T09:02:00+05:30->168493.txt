PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   (PCMC) will come up with a multi-modal transport hub at the bus terminus being constructed at   in Nigdi within three months. 

 Bus rapid transit system (BRTS) cell spokesperson Vijay Bhojane said the total cost of the project is Rs 4 crore. "There are three platforms for arrival and departure of BRTS buses and two for non-BRTS buses at the terminus," he said. Around 250 to 300 buses will arrive at and depart from the terminus. The construction began in May 2015 and 90% of the work is complete. Electrication, signage and an Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) are yet to be completed.
 
 "There is a possibility of the electrical and other items being stolen if left unused. So the remaining work will be completed before starting the BRTS service," he added.
 
 Explaining the operation of the terminus, he said, "The civic body has proposed to start the BRTS bus terminus on the 12km stretch of   highway from Bhakti Shakti Chowk in Nigdi to Harris bridge on Mula river at Dapodi".
 
 Commuters from Talegaon, Vadgaon Maval, Dehugao, Dehu Road and other areas coming via the Pune-Mumbai highway using non-BRTS PMPML buses will have to change buses to reach their destinations. But they will have to purchase only one ticket for the entire journey. 
 
 He said this will save time as BRTS buses will take them to their destinations quicker. The commuters will also be able to take buses from the terminus to various parts of Pimpri Chinchwad, as well as outside the municipal limits like Hinjewadi, Maan, Talegaon, Vadgaon Maval and Dehugaon.
 
 "With a total area of 800sq metre, it will be bigger than the BRTS bus termini at Kiwale and Bhosari," Bhojane said.
