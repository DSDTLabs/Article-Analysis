Ferozepur: The Border Security Force (BSF) arrested a 12-year-old hearing-and speech-impaired boy from Pakistan who appeared to have accidentally crossed the border near Shan-e-Hind gate close to Hussainiwala joint check post in Ferozepur sector on Wednesday evening. According to BSF, the boy was spotted by an officer on duty when he entered the Indian territory. They have also found a 20-rupee Pakistani note in the possession of the boy who was wearing an embroidered kurta traditionally worn in the neighbouring country. “We are trying to contact the Pakistan Rangers to hand over the boy,” a BSF officer said. Sources claimed that a school for the hearing-and-speech-impaired in Faridkot has also been approached to ascertain the identity of the boy.
