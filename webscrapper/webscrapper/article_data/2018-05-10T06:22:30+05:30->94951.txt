BENGALURU: A city sessions court has   a cab driver accused of murdering a   employee, observing that there is no material evidence to prove a witness’s presence during the crime.

 In their  , police claimed Sunita Kumar, 29, a Tavarekere resident, was murdered by cab driver Dhanraj at 1.30pm on March 20, 2014. The woman, on her way out after her shift, was stabbed by Dhanraj more than a dozen times at one of the Turf Club gates when she resisted his advances, police said.
 
 On that day, police claimed Subramani, a constable manning a traffic signal (at Trilight Circle) opposite the club, rushed to the spot and caught Dhanraj, now 47. Subramani was the complainant and the prosecution’s main witness. But more than four years later, police failed to provide material evidence that Subramani was present at the spot, following which the court acquitted Dhanraj.
 
 Advocate C H Hanumantharayappa, arguing on behalf of Dhanraj, contended there was no material evidence to prove Subramani was present when the incident took place.
 
 Judge Madhusudhan B, in his April 23, 2018 order, said: “On going through the evidence on record, it is very much clear that material documents in proof of Subramani’s deputation to perform his traffic-control duties at Trilight Circle on that day have not been produced.”
 
 The judgment further reads that the High Grounds police inspector, who conducted the probe, ought to have obtained at least a certificate from his investigating officer certifying his presence at Trilight Circle that day. “Non-production of documents ... creates doubt in my mind about Subramani having performed his duties at Trilight Circle. It is very much clear the investigating officer has not followed the procedure for arrest and detention of the accused as laid down by the Supreme Court,” the judge added.
