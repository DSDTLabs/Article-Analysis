MOHALI:   government has directed Greater Mohali Area Development Authority ( ) to expedite repair works at the airport road. The directions have been given to Gamada five months after Punjab chief minister told the authority to complete the work. The repair works at the airport road had to be completed by December 2017 as per the CM's orders. It has now been over five months that a significant portion of the road still remains in limbo. 

 Recently, after a delay of over four months, the road was opened for the vehicular traffic, but the repaired portion of the road still gave bumpy rides due to its uneven patches.
 
  "The orders to expedite the repair of the airport road have already been given to the officers concerned. We believe that the road will be completely thrown open for the vehicular traffic before monsoon," said additional chief secretary department of housing and urban development Vini Mahajan.
 
 "Many factors lead to the delay of repair works. Weather plays a crucial role in the construction of roads," she added.
 
 It was observed that one side of the road, which the Gamada claims to have finished working on, is marred with patches and gives the commuters rough and bumpy ride.
 
 To this, chief engineer of Gmada Sunil Kansal said, "We have opened one side of the road. This portion of the road has been thrown open to check the load bearing capacity. We will re-carpet the entire portion for smooth driving experience."
 
 "As of now, the other side of the road is under repair and would be made operational by May-end. The road has been dug up at 40 to 50 places measuring 50 metres and around 3 feet deep to relay the foundation before re-carpeting. At other places the potholes will be patched and the cracks will be sealed as per the ministry of road transport and highways (India) specifications and CRRI's recommendations," he added.
