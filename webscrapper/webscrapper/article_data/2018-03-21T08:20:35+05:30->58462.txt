AHMEDABAD: With the backdrop of the recently unearthed frauds,   ( ) Western Region plans to focus on sensitising industry to  

 “We need to be an ‘accountable nation’ before becoming a ‘developed nation’. We are asking industry members to start becoming accountable on the corporate governance front. We are advising them not to indulge in fraudulent practices,” said Piruz Khambatta, the new chairman of CII Western Region, which has come out with a focus theme, ‘ARISE’ — accountability, reforms, innovation, sustainability and employment.
 
 To spread awareness about corporate governance and ethical practices, the industry body plans to launch sensitisation initiatives, discussions and round-table conferences.
 
 “Demonetization, GST and the insolvency and bankruptcy code are big reforms of the Central government. However, policy reform at the state level is also needed. There are many state level acts such as the Land Ceiling Act, which are very old. Archaic laws and bureaucratic procedures come in the way of growth. If these barriers are removed, growth can be accelerated,” he added.
 
 “We will identify such old laws and policies and take to the state government for policy reform. I believe we need to work with the government for economic development,” he said.
 
 Saying ‘sustainable development’ is the need of the hour, Khambatta said the industry body will connect its members to centres of excellences for green buildings, food, agriculture and water. “The western region will focus on promoting green technologies in manufacturing and infrastructure development,” he added.
 
 The association’s agenda for 2018-19 is to support SMEs through various initiatives so more jobs can be created.
