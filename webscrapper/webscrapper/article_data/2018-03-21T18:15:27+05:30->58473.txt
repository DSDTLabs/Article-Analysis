NEW DELHI: On August 17, 2016, as soon as Vinesh Phogat’s right leg contorted into a gruesome angle, with her Rio Olympics quarter-final opponent Sun Yanan’s weight and strength weighing down on her right knee, the viewer immediately knew something was seriously wrong. That injury cut off Vinesh’s quest for Olympics glory and forced her into the rough road of rehabilitation, one no doubt burdened by self doubt. 

 
 
 
 A little over a year later, Vinesh returned post that career-threatening injury sustained in Rio and won a silver medal (55kg) at the Asian   Championship in New Delhi and later in 2017 claimed gold at the National Wrestling Championships. 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 Now, the 23-year-old will be heading to the upcoming 2018   to be held at   City, in the southeast of the Australian state of Queensland from April 4-15, with her confidence intact. In her only appearance at the   in the previous edition held in Glasgow four years ago, Vinesh stormed to gold in the women’s freestyle 48 kg category by beating Rosemary Nweke, Jasmine Man and Yana Rattigan. 
 
 At this year’s CWG, Vinesh will be competing in the women’s 50 kg category. 
 
 An Asian Games bronze medallist and a five-time Asian Championship medallist, Vinesh has come a long way from that painful day in Rio. Fans of Indian sport will hope she buries the ghosts of the 2016 Olympics and carved another niche in the pantheon of Indian wrestling.
