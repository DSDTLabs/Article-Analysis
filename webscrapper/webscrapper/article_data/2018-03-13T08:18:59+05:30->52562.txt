BENGALURU: Even as   president G   on Monday ruled out the possibility of disgruntled   cross-voting in the   polls, the selection of candidates has evoked a mixed response.

 While the Parameshwara camp is jubilant that two of his nominees — L Hanumanthaiah and G C Chandrashekhar — had got tickets, some   MLAs were skeptical of an easy victory for the third seat. The other candidate, Syed Naseer Hussain, was reportedly recommended by Mallikarjun M Kharge and Oscar Fernandes.
 
  
 Party sources said chief minister Siddaramaiah had given a list of former MLC Saleem Ahmed, MLC K Govindaraju and realtor Channa Reddy but none was considered. While minister R Roshan Baig’s name was on the verge of being cleared, Kharge and minister H K Patil are said to have insisted on representation for North  .
 
 “They came up with the names of Iqbal Ahmed Saradgi and A M Hindasgeri which were turned down on the grounds of age. It was then that Kharge suggested Hussain’s name,’’ sources said.
 
 The filing of nomination papers by Congress candidates was a low-key affair as Siddaramaiah was away in   and Congress campaign committee chairman D K Shivakumar was in his constituency.
 
 JD(S) supremo  , upset with Congress for not giving the third seat, is said to be exploring all options for the victory of his candidate B M  . “We don’t rule out cross-voting by some Congress MLAs though polling is by open ballot. By defying the whip, they have nothing to lose other than being denied the assembly ticket,’’ JD(S) sources said.
 
 “I don’t see any such possibility and voting will take place on expected lines,’’ Parameshwara said.
