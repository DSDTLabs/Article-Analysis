LUCKNOW: In what could be a possible seat sharing formula by   in the   of 2019, both parties are considering an option to field their candidates in seats where they finished second during the   in 2014. Of the total 80 seats, the two parties finished second in 65 seats – BSP in 34 and SP in 31.

 
 With the focus on SP and BSP coming together ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, leaders from the two parties are believed to have started discussions on the modalities of such an alliance. To begin with, the two sides are seeking feedback from party workers on this formula.
 
 
 The remaining 15 seats are not included in the current discussions. These include the five seats that SP won and the two bagged by Congress. Similarly, the six seats where Congress stood second in 2014 and one each where   (RLD) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) were runners up have also not been taken into account.
 
 Sources said the two parties are trying to draw a broad consensus between them in case SP and BSP plan to contest the elections together, without involving more partners.
 
 
 
 
 “Collecting feedback and discussions with cadres on seat sharing and other issues is a part of any alliance but the final decision regarding the nature and shape of the alliance and seat sharing formula will be taken by the national presidents of the two parties,” said SP MLC Udaiveer Singh, a close aide of SP chief  . He said the final shape of the alliance will appear only after the approval of the two party heads.
 
 
 Senior SP leaders confirmed that feedback from party workers have been sought in order to ensure the participation of the supporters at the grassroots level – something that both the parties have done in the run up to the Gorakhpur and   as well. “The exercise will not only help send out a message down the line that the party values the sentiments of workers, but will also gauge their mood as well,” said a senior leader privy to the exercise.
