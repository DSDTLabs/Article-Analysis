 will soon install a technology to identify defects in the under-frame of a coach and wheels in real-time. It will help prevent derailments.

 In all, 25 locations have been identified to install the   ( ) for trains around Mumbai. The total cost of the first phase of the project is Rs 113 crore.
 
 Principal chief mechanical engineer Arum Arora said, "In the next phase 40 locations have been identified."
 
 It will help detect faults while on the run, making maintenance faster. The conventional method was to physically examine coaches when stationary.
 
 A railway board official said, "As the train passes via this hi-tech device, it will capture sounds of the underframe of coaches. Based on this, it will determine whether any of the 35 parameters has any defect." Once a defect is identified, an alert is generated in the control room, giving the coach number so that the fault can be attended to.
 
 The defect can be identified even if a train runs at maximum speed of 100 kmph and results can be generated in 90 minutes.
