GURUGRAM: Members of the   from   are infuriated with the road, traffic and sanitation conditions in the area. They claim that even after writing to multiple authorities many a time, things haven’t changed much.

 According to the industry members, issues like illegal dumping of waste on the road, unauthorised   on both sides of the road, innumerable potholes and broken speed bumps are making their life difficult. 
 
 A delegation of office-goers, including representatives from Siemens, Nagarro, Orient Crafts, Delphique, Shri Infrastructure, along with few residents of the area, went to meet GMDA officials and the police commissioner to find a solution to end their miseries.
 
 “We need proper traffic management to control and regulate traffic on Anath Road. People working in different factories here have no place to walk due to unnecessary congestion by trucks parked on both sides of the road,” said NS Grewal of Orient Crafts. 
 
 The industry representatives said the officials had earlier assured them of all support and had promised to take up the project as priority. However, it has been a couple of years but nothing has changed.
 
 “Apart from poor   and chaotic traffic condition, issues like leaking   lines, waterlogging also plague the area,” said Megha Jha of Nagarro.
 
 “The construction work is underway which is causing some issues. We are now issuing challans for illegal parking on Wednesday and I have personally visited the spot as well. We are also working with the MCG for streamlining the traffic on the road,” said Simarjeet Singh , ACP (traffic).
