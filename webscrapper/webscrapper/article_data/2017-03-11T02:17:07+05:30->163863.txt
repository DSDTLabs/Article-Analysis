MUMBAI: Last year saw 10  , with 268 fatalities, across the globe, but the number of accidents has been on a decrease if data from 2011 onwards is studied, said the   (IATA) on Friday. 

 “Last year, some 3.8 billion travelers flew safely on 40.4 million flights. The number of total accidents, fatal accidents and fatalities all declined versus the five-year average (2011-2015), showing that aviation continues to become safer,” said  , director general and CEO of IATA, which represents about 265 airlines comprising 83% of global air traffic.
 
 Last year wasn’t as safe as 2015 though. In 2016, the   (where the aircraft is damaged so badly that it has to be written off) was 0.35 (one accident for every 2.86 million flights). It was a step back from the 0.22 accidents per million flights achieved by IATA airlines in 2015. “We did take a step back on some key parameters from the exceptional performance of 2015. However, flying is still the safest form of long distance travel. The goal is for every flight to depart and arrive without incident,” he added.
 
 If only major jet accidents are taken into account, 2016 was one of the worst years in recent times. The major jet accident rate (hull losses per 1 million flights) was 0.39, — or one major accident for every 2.56 million flights. This was not as good as the 0.32 achieved in 2015.
 
 The all accident rate (measured in accidents per 1 million flights) was 1.61 in 2016, an improvement from 1.79 in 2015.
