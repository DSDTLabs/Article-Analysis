MADURAI: The chairman of the V O Chidambaranar Port Trust has been issued a notice by the Madras high court Madurai bench on a plea accusing the port authorities of not obtaining permission to operate the port. 

  S P Muthuraman of   filed the petition. When it came up for hearing before the division bench headed by chief justice  , counsel for the petitioner said the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act mandated the obtaining of 'consent to establish' and 'consent to operate' prior to commence any activities in respect of highly polluting units.
