BENGALURU: The deteriorating state of Bengaluru’s waterbodies has been highlighted yet again. Latest data on the quality of water in the city’s tanks/lakes shows that only two waterbodies — Agara Lake and   training centre fishing area — have water quality index at satisfactory levels.

 The water quality data comes from the   ( ), which collected samples from 53 waterbodies in the city between April and December last year. The lakes which failed to make the cut are spread across the city, and the water from most of them is not even fit for consumption by animals, let alone humans or for bathing. Even in lakes where the index is satisfactory, water can be used for human consumption only after conventional treatment followed by disinfection.
 
 
  
  
 
 The data only indicates that more lakes are going the infamous   and   way, the two waterbodies known for frequent frothing and fire.
 
 Somasundarapalya Lake in Bommanahalli, Shivapura tank and   in Peenya, Puttenahalli Lake in Yelahanka are among those with poorest water quality.
 
 The KSPCB collected water samples under two programmes — Global Environment Monitoring System for fresh water (GEMS) and Monitoring of Indian National Aquatic Resources System (MINARS). B Ramanath Rai, minister for forest, ecology and environment, presented this data in response to an unstarred question recently in the legislative assembly. Based on water quality, lakes are graded between classes A and E, with A being best quality and E the worst.
 
 A senior official from the KSPCB told TOI that though Agara Lake test results showed poor water quality, the waterbody has become better in the past few months due to the efforts of Karnataka Lake Development and Conservation Authority. Even the fishing area of Ulsoor Lake has good quality water because the BBMP has been maintaining it, he added.
