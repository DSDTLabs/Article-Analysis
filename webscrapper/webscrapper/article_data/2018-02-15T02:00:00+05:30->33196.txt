PATNA: Flower sellers and vendors stock huge quantities of roses to cope up with the extra demand during the Valentine’s week. However, this year is an exception as the demand and sale of roses was very low. 

 Some vendors blame the dip in demand on the online sale of flowers. Anshul Poddar, the owner of a flower shop near Dak Bungalow roundabout, said, “Youngsters have started ordering flowers and other gifts online and sending them to distant places in no time. As a result, the demand for flowers has gone down.”
 
 Poddar, who used to sell roses for Rs 60 each on Valentine’s Day every year, had to lower the price because of few takers and poor demand. The cost of each rose at his shop is Rs 40 each this time.
 
 Another florist, Santosh Singh, who has a shop at Maurya Lok Complex, also complained that sales had dropped. He said, “At the beginning of this month, roses were in demand. However, very few people turned up at my shop on Valentine’s Day. I don’t know what happened this time.”
 
 However, makeshift stalls near city temples received positive response from customers and earned profit by selling roses. Munna Kumar, who runs a shop near the Shiva temple at Dinkar Chowk, told this reporter, “On other days, roses are available for Rs 8-10 each. On Valentine’s Day, we increase the price to Rs 20 each which is nothing. Sometimes, people try to bargain, but most of them pay the money because of the quality of roses we provide.”
 
 One of the customers, Shivesh asked, “Why will I buy roses at high prices from big shops? I prefer going to local shops as they do not charge much and offer good quality of flowers.”
