HYDERABAD: The ranking of Hyderabad at the 22nd spot in the   Survekshan 2017 elicited a mixed response from citizens with many opining that the onus of keeping the city clean and improving its ratings on the Swachh scorecard rests largely on the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ).

 Colony associations and denizens in the peripheral areas said that as these areas have a higher number of open plots, the chances of these being used for dumping garbage are more. “If open plots are turned into organic farms, they can be of productive. They can provide employment and solve the garbage menace,” said  , a resident of  , located on the city’s outskirts.
 
 Residents’ associations in the   area said that GHMC employees need to be extremely dedicated and highly motivated to keep the city clean. “If any building or lane is dirty, people tend to throw more trash there. If the lane is well maintained, people will think twice before littering,” said Roop Darak a resident of Old City.
 
 Chandanagar residents feel people need to work closely with the civic body to attain the best results. “Being a cosmopolitan city, Hyderabad has people from diverse backgrounds. This diversity of thoughts can lead to excellent ideas and help them align their goals towards the common goal of keeping Hyderabad clean,” pointed out environmentalist Krishna Kazi.
 
 Then there are some like Krishna M of Old Malakpet who feels that construction of public toilets can push Hyderabad to the top slot in the Swachh rankings by fulfilling the dream of making the city Open Defecation Free. “Every household should be provided with a toilet and the number of public washrooms too should be increased,” he said.
 
 Others like homemaker   said educating citizens about segregation of waste is key as many people know that GHMC is distributing bins of two colours to segregate waste but are not aware of its importance. “Awareness should be spread through ad campaigns about segregation of waste,” she said.
