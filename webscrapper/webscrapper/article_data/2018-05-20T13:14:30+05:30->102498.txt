SECUNDERABAD: Lack of awareness about authorized   tickets is landing passengers in the net of South Central Railway’s vigilance department sleuths who are conducting massive drives across the zone to curb the malpractice.

 
 Sources say irregular travels are spiraling up all over the zone, especially Hyderabad division. “In the previous year, over 17,000 cases had been registered for irregular travels. The figure jumped to two lakh this time. Offenders mostly tend to board first class compartments of MMTS trains or reserved coaches of mail or express trains,” said the sources.
 
  
  
 
 As per norms, a railway ticket is not transferable once it is issued to any person, but it is found during the drives that many passengers resort to buying or collecting tickets from others, thus flouting the laws. “In order to avoid the queues, people often buy tickets from others who have cancelled their trips for some reasons. But such transfer of tickets that have been issued in other persons’ names are not allowed and following norms, we are to penalize passengers traveling with such unauthorized tickets,” a railway official told TOI.
 
 During the recent drives held in April and May, officials of the vigilance department caught 152 passengers traveling with tickets illegally transferred to them. During emergency, many passengers fall in the trap of unauthorized travels because of the touts who manage coax people to buy tickets from them.
 
 In a recent drive, 46 checks to bust the touting rackets were conducted at various reservation offices and other locations at major stations under the zone. “Vigilance department sleuths arrested one tout and hunts are on for other rackets,” said an official.
 
 The number of passengers travelling with irregular tickets is more than those travelling ticketless. “While the vigilance dept officials held 894 persons for traveling without tickets, 908 persons were found travelling with irregular tickets,” said the officials.
