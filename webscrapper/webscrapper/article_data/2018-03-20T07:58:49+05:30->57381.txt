GANDHINAGAR: The   has admitted that the Rs 287 crore   proposed in 2012 by Narendra Modi — as Gujarat chief minister — to the Prime Minister at the time, Manmohan Singh, has not been approved yet. The admission comes amid the central government’s preparations to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, which falls next year. 

 On Monday, Gujarat’s tourism minister Ganpat Vasava stated on record: “According to the 2013 list of matters pending with the Government of India, the ‘Revitalization Plan for Gandhi Ashram Area’ is still under the Government of India’s consideration.” Vasava was responding in writing to questions asked by two Congress MLAs, Gyasuddin Shaikh and Himmatsinh Patel. “Over the past two years, the matter has been followed up once by the state government,” Vasava said.
 
 Last year, when Prime Minister Modi visited the Sabarmati Ashram to take part in the centenary celebration of the ashram established by Mahatma Gandhi, it was expected that he would announce the approval of the revitalization plan. The approval has not been granted yet. Incidentally, Modi has visited the ashram twice as Prime Minister, escorting foreign leaders.
 
 The Gujarat government had submitted the revitalization plan in July 2009 to the Union tourism ministry. The plan was not approved by the UPA government at the Centre, though the state government submitted a revised version subsequently. 
 
 The plan was prepared by the Centre for Environmental Planning & Technology (Cept) University and B V Doshi, the famed architect who was recently awarded the ‘architecture Nobel’, the Pritzker Prize for 2018, on March 7. Under the project, the Gujarat government had planned to declare the Sabarmati Ashram area a silent zone.
 
 The ashram is surrounded by heavily congested and polluted roads and commercial and residential areas. The revitalization plan aims to conserve the heritage structure, consolidate public space around the historic building, and improve infrastructure.
