GURGAON:   Singh, the Gurgaon MP and a minister of state in the Modi government, sent a strong message to the   government when he brought over six Independent councillors to the   fold, handing the party a majority in the Gurgaon corporation. Two of the six had been suspended by BJP for contesting against the party's wishes. 

 In Sunday's election, BJP was the only party that contested all 35 seats, but managed to win just 14, with Independents - some of them rebel BJP candidates - bagging 20 seats and INLD one. Khattar, who visited Gurgaon on Tuesday, said BJP had done well.
 
  But on Wednesday, Rao Inderjit did not mince words. "The ticket distribution should have been handled in a better way; more thought should have been applied. I was not part of the ticket distribution. The expectation was much higher," he told TOI . 
 
 With six Independents joining BJP, the party's strength is now 20, two more than the halfway mark. After the formal joining at the party's Sector 10 office in the presence of Haryana BJP general secretary Sandeep Joshi, the six were taken to the Delhi BJP headquarters for a meeting with senior leaders.
 
 "The Independents who joined today contacted me and expressed their keenness to join the party as they believe in its policy and its leaders," Rao Inderjit said. 
 
 "Some of them might have been suspended by the party but their faith in the party is intact and that is why we decided to accede to their request," Rao Inderjit said.
 
 The six who joined BJP are Dinesh Saini (ward 8), Naveen Dahiya (12), Rajni Sahni (17), Ashwani Sharma (19), Sunita Yadav (22), and   (31). With Inderjit stealing a march in ensuring that the party gets a majority, there is speculation that his rival and party colleague Rao Narbir, who is a cabinet minister in the Khattar government and the   from Badshahpur, might also parade another set of Independents on Thursday.
