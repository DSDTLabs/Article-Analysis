 In Alwar parliamentary seat, the assembly segment of Alwar Urban and Mundawar recorded the lowest polling percentage at about 55% each while in in the Ajmer Lok Sabha seat the urban assembly segments of Ajmer North and Ajmer South have been the lowest in polling percentage at 55.88% and 59.32%, respectively.

While in Ajmer, Sanwar Lal Jat had defeated Sachin Pilot with a margin of 1,71,983 votes. The by-election was necessitated due to the untimely passing away of Mahant Chandnath and Sanwarlal Jat. 
 
 In the bypoll, the Congress had replaced Jitendra Singh with Dr Karan Singh, a former MP from Alwar to get back the seat for the Congress while the BJP has fielded a state cabinet minister Dr Jaswant Yadav. In Ajmer, the by-election has turned into a prestige battle for both CM Vasundhara Raje and state PCC president Sachin Pilot.
 
 Chief minister had kept her promise given to former MP Sanwarlal Jat by fielding his son, a green horn, Ramswaroop Lamba as party candidate despite protest in the party. For the PCC president Sachin Pilot it would be sweet revenge for his defeat in the last election if he could capture the seat from the BJP. He had put in all his energy to anchor the party candidate Dr Rahgu Sharma campaign.
 
 In Mandalgarh though the voting began on low key gathered momentum as the day progressed and culminated with the highest turn out of over 78% while filing this report.
