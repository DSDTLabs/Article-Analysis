NEW DELHI: The upcoming   at   in South Delhi will be known as  . National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) said on Wednesday that the WTC Association, New York, has given the licence to use the name for a one-time licence fee.

 Sources said NBCC has paid between Rs 2 crore and Rs 2.5 crore to get this trademark and will pay nominal annual fee to WTC, which is a non-profit body in the United States. NBCC said this will help the government-run entity to sell the project at premium because of the tag.
 
 “The licence to use WTC is given if a complex meets the set parameters such as office complex, retail space, auditorium, food court and conferencing facilities. Anyone owning a space here can get space for any event at discounted charge in any WTC complexes across the world,” NBCC chairman and managing director Anoop Kumar Mittal said.
 
 The complex will have 12 commercial towers spanning over 3.2 million sq ft area, which is world’s fourth largest office space. The project is scheduled for completion by 2020.
 
 So far 21 complexes have got the WTC tag and only five of them are operational in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Pune, Noida and Kochi. “This one developed by a government-owned company will be the biggest one and having an office here will add the prestige of the company,” Mittal said.
 
 The company expects to get about Rs 12,000- 13,000 crore from sale of these 12 towers. The proceeds would be used to meet the construction cost of redevelopment of seven housing colonies in Delhi at over Rs 32,000 crore.
 
 NBCC also announced to start the sale of over 1,000 ready-to-move-in houses in this festive season in the NCR.
