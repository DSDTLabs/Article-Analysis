NAGPUR: State Anti-Naxal Operation (ANO) cell officials, addressing a group of students from Maoist-affected   district, appealed to focus on education for development. The students were present at the Unconventional Operations Training Centre ( ) at Suraburdi on Tuesday as part of their government sponsored ‘Maharashtra-darshan’ tour.

 DySP, ANO,  , shared his vision with the students while appealing to them to follow the life and wisdom of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar. He also said the students should follow the path of education to usher the light of development in their individual lives and also that of the district which is still reeling under backwardness without basic infrastructure like education, health and such amenities. 
 
 Mhaisekar said Maoists have been misleading the tribal population for their vested interest. “The Maoists are sending their children to modern institutions so as to ensure they work in multinational companies with high salaries but they want the tribals to remain uneducated,” he said. “The Maoists have also created hurdles in the way of development of the district,” said Mhaisekar while addressing the students who are the participants of the 19th such tour from district. 
 
 Apart from Mhaisekar, vice-principal of UOTC and DySP Dipak Patil too guided the students to take up a positive approach in life and focus on constructive activities. 
 
 The students also got to observe the paintings of police head constable from Yavatmal district Shekhar Wandre, who had put up an exhibition of his art at UOTC with the theme of Warli paintings of the tribal culture.
