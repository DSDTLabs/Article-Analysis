  Playback singer Angarag Mahanta, popularly known as Papon, left the Yuva Dasara crowd mesmerized, by crooning songs like Kyon from Barfi, Bulleya from Sultan, Humnava from Hamari Adhuri Kahani, Sari Thappu Kelada Moha from Kannada movie Plus and more.   “This is the second time I have performed in this city. Mysuru thoroughly deserves its tag as being the cleanest city of the country. The roads are very well maintained, for which we have to appreciate the people and the authorities who are involved in keeping the city clean. The heritage vibe can be felt the moment anyone arrives in the city,” says Papon, who had earlier performed for a corporate event in Mysuru. Though, Papon hails from a musical family, he had to work his way up to make a mark, “My parents never forced music on me. They gave me the basic education of music and allowed me to learn on my own and let me explore different genres. My father and mother have been the biggest influence on my music,” he adds.   Of the different genres of music, Papon says, “I am fortunate that I was able to pick up the nuances of folk, electronica, pop and rock music. The culture in north eastern states is such that it allowed me to learn a variety of music.” About his upcoming projects, Papon says, “I am currently working on a ghazal album.” So, what does he would have become, if not a singer, “I would have been a farmer,” he states, adding, “During childhood, I used to indulge in farming activities.”
