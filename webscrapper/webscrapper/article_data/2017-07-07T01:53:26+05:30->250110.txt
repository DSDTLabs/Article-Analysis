MUMBAI: Deputy inspector general (prisons)   Sathe who is conducting an independent inquiry into the death of inmate Manjula Shetye sent out texts on a social messaging group that has senior prison authorities as it members to garner support for the six jail staffers who have been arrested. The Whatsapp messages have gone viral on social media.

 Shetye died on June 23 after allegedly being assaulted by prison authorities at  . One of the messages posted by   read: “All our 6 coullege sisters arrested today evening pc till 7 july. Atleast now the soul of media should stop following. ? Feeling sad n upset. (sic)”. Within a few minutes, Sathe sent another text message on the group, saying, “Dhamne sir, Desai sir We all jail authorities and staff should give moral support to our sisters (sic).” When there was no reply to her messages, she wrote in Marathi: “Arre itkya lokaani vaachle, nidaan yes tari mhana (So many people have read the messages, at least say a yes)”. 
 
 TOI called up and messaged Sathe as well IG (prisons) BK Upadhaya several times, however, they did not respond.
 
 The messages have led to an outcry from activists and Shetye’s family. Her elder brother, Anand, speaking to TOI said, “My sister was a good human being. She was to be released in a few months. Now I have got the messages that jailer Swati Sathe sent to her colleagues. I am shocked that such a senior officer would go to this extent. I don’t trust the police as they will support their colleagues even if they have done wrong. I feel that strong action should be initiated against her and the inquiry should be handed over to some other agency.”
 
 Former IPS officer YP Singh said, “I think Sathe has already made up her mind so this violates the rules of natural justice. Now she will become a judge of her own cause. This inquiry can become questionable at a later stage because of lack of neutrality.”
