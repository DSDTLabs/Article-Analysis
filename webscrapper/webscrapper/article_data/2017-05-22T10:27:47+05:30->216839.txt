PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A diverse   out to play on a vehicle-free   and took home best memories from the second   outing in Pimple Saudagar.

 The event received an overwhelming response from its earnest participants. Manoj Shitalani, a businessman from Pimpri, said that the event should be held once or twice every month throughout the year. “It has brought together families and friends and given individuals an opportunity to indulge in fitness activities,” added Shitalani.
 
 Abhijit Pathak came all the way from Vimannagar and was all praises about his first time at a Happy Streets event. “This is a great stress buster. It should be held in all parts of Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad,” he said.
 
 Kids were teeming with joy and couldn’t get enough of the games and other exciting programmes. 
 
 Gauri Salunke of Pimple Saudagar said, “I am here with my neighbour and cousins who have come from Satara to spend their vacation. Hurdle race and dancing were our favourites.”
 
 Pratik Sharma of Pimple Saudagar said, “This community endeavour allows you to spend quality time with your family. My children got completely engrossed in hurdle race and drawing.”
 
 Taking a break from his busy work life, techie   of Pimple Saudagar cycled along the motor-free stretch.
 
 Another resident, Rishikesh Anparker said, “I liked the fitness arena where one could test one’s fitness. I liked pulling the thick ropes to form waves and practice boxing.”
 
 Youngsters got a chance to show off their physical strength in a push-ups contest, while some took a shot at moving a huge tyre bare-handed for about a stretch of 20 to 30 feet.
 
 Pulling just a few tricks was all that a performing magician needed to spellbind an entire crowd at the venue.
