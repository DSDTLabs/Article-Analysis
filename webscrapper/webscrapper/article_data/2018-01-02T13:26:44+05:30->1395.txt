JAMSHEDPUR: Picnickers thronged popular holiday spots across Steel City and adjoining areas on a foggy New Year morning on Monday. 

 The crowd also basked in the wintry sunny and enjoyed the gentle breeze. They also make the most of every moment of their outing with family, friends and colleagues on Monday.
 
 Dimna Lake and Jubilee Park, which traditionally attract the major chunk of merrymakers, witnessed a heavy rush of revellers who arrived from near-by towns of neighbouring states of   and Odisha along with the home crowd and people from adjoining districts. 
 
 "We would go to our relatives place every Christmas, for many years now. We would then go on a picnic on New Year day before we leave for our home the next day," K J Ganesh, a resident of Kharagpur, Bengal said while he was with his family at Jubilee Park. 
 
 Around 12.30pm, fewer people jostled for space at Jubilee park. "I had no idea that the crowd rush would be so heavy," said 36-year-old Manoj Singh, an ancillary factory employee who was looking for space near the park gate for his three-member-family. 
 
 Likewise, Life Insurance Corporation executive  , who arrived at Dimna Lake with his family from Jaudguda, said a family picnic was a part of the annual calendar event of theirs. 
 
 "Dimna Lake and Jubilee Park are the two popular destinations for picnickers in the city besides Burudih dam and Narwah picnic spot (both in Ghatshila)," Singh said. 
 
 The other picnic spots -   park which is adjacent to Keenan stadium, Theme park in Telco, Hudco dam, Bhetya park in Kadma and   river front in Sonari also witnessed packed audience with women and children constituting the major chunk. 
 
 All the streets lead to the parks which also witnessed a rush of the vehicles with picnic enthusiasts heading for their preferred destinations since early hours.
