NEW DELHI: After the then LG, Najeeb Jung, scrapped the penalty clause for unscheduled outages as it didn’t have his consent, the   has come out with a new   on   code regulations.   has sought suggestions from the public, to be sent in latest by February 20.

 The draft lists rules that must be followed by discoms while distributing power and the penalty for non-adherence. These cover subjects like safety and standards of supply, distribution through franchisee, conditions for new and existing connections, rules for enhancing load, conversion of single-point connection into individual connection, change of category on the request of the consumer, and so on.
 
 The guidelines are expected to come as a boost to consumers who will now know what kind of performance standards they should expect from the power supplier, the time-frame in which these have to be delivered and the compensation payable to them if it doesn’t happen.
 
 In the case of applying for a new connection, for example, a list of guidelines has been laid out on the process, documents required and the procedure to be followed. Similar instructions have been issued on other subjects, such as load sanction and demand note.
 
 There are also separate sections on unauthorised use of electricity, theft and other irregularities. The crucial part, however, is about compensation, the amounts for which vary from 1% to 2% of any charges deposited by a consumer for each day of default.
