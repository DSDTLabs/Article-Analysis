THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: At a time when the high court has warned the government of 'vigilance raj' in the state, officials of the PWD department are showing reluctance in taking decisions fearing vigilance probe. Now, the World Bank interim mission, which reviewed the progress of the second phase of   (KSTP-II), has asked PWD to immediately clear pending payments of KSTP contractors, that has been stuck on technical issues.

 As per KSTP contract, the contractors must be paid their due amount within 28 days. If government needs some clarification, another 28 days can be taken.
 
 However, most of the contractors ­ four of them ­ have been denied payment for the past six months.
 
 Sources close to World Bank said that many of the officials defer decisions fearing vigilance interventions as they allot huge sums of money.
 
 Around Rs 80crore is pending clearance for the past six months. The amount has to be paid to contractors such as RDS, EKK, Sreedhanya and  , who appraised the situation to the World Bank officials during interim mission.
 
 Even rules state that the project director can take decisions in variations less than 25%. It is worth noticing that PWD minister   had suspected former project director and chief engineer P G  , though PWD internal vigilance had found him not guilty of allegations.
 
 The PWD fears to take decision on variations in actual work from the DPR. In case of the  , the actual road blasting required was 88000 m3 for road construction while the DPR found only 1800 m3. In such cases, the contractors proceeded with the work after getting consent from the KSTP. However, the payment has been withheld due to opposition from CTE.
 
 Sources said that Sudhakaran assured World Bank team to clear payments immediately.
