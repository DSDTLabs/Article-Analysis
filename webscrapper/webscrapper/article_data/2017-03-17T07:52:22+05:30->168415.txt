HYDERABAD: City doctors warn that about 10% of road accidents are due to lack of sufficient sleep or fatigue.About 2.3 lakh of the 23 lakh road mishaps in the country every year are linked to feeling sleepy.

Many recent accidents in AP and Telangana have been linked to the driver feeling drowsy just before the dawn. A majority of road mishaps occur between 3am and 5am when the brain forces the body to doze off as part of the natural urge.

Lack of proper sleep also causes inflammation in the body and the consequent results could be harmful.
 
 Lalit Pai, chief executive officer of  , said sleep apnea puts a person at the risk of heart failure, stroke and even road accidents. “Recent data suggests that an estimated 2.3 lakh to 3.5 lakh road accidents are a result of sleepiness,“ he said.
 
 According to senior consultant pulmonologist Dr  , the accident risk is two to six times higher for those suffering from sleep apnea than it is for regular drivers. “Every day in our country a lot of accidents are caused by drivers with sleep apnea falling asleep at the wheel,“ he added.
