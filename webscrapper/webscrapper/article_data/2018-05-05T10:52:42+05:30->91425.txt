HYDERABAD: The   has issued notice to the Telangana home secretary asking him for means of resolving the problem of under trial prisoners who are unable to leave jails despite securing bail on account of their inability to furnish sureties.

 
 The bench of acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K   was hearing a public interest petition filed by social activist K Murali who brought to the notice the plight of 180 under trial prisoners languishing in state jails despite securing bails. Usually, the trial courts lay down conditions while granting bail including furnishing security and sureties.Under trials hailing from economically weak backgrounds find it hard to fulfil these conditions, D  , the counsel for the petitioner said.
 
 The bench sought to know, what would happen if the accused run from the law. He responded that there are recommendations from the   and judgments from higher courts to release all in jail for one year for petty offences even at the pre-trial stage. Their inability to furnish security should not be a reason for depriving them of their rights, Kumar said. The counsel told the court that 50 of the under trials have remained in jail even two years after getting bail. The bench sought a counter from the home secretary within four weeks and posted the case to June.
