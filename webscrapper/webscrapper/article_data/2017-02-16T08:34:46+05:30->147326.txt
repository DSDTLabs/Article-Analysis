VADODARA: The incident of a   councillor allegedly trying to assault a Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) executive engineer has come at a juncture when the civic body would rather have avoided any confrontation with its staffers. 

 Various unions of VMC including that of the engineers have already charted out an agitation programme over other major issues. The unions of VMC workers and engineers are to begin an agitation on Thursday regarding a long list of demands pertaining to employment issues. These include reinstatement of contract workers and staffers whose services were terminated recently and permanent appointments instead of the contractual jobs given by the civic body.
 
 The unions had also raised the issue of the safety of personnel as they did not have any safety and had to face violence while on duty. They had also pointed out that some top officials used to misbehave with employees.
 
 D R Devmurari, president of Vadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan Engineers Association (VMSSEA), said, “We will be organizing a rally on Thursday. This will be besides the agitation programme and strike over the assault.” Besides VMSSEA, other unions too had joined the flash strike on Wednesday after BJP councillor   allegedly tried to slap executive engineer  .
 
 On Friday, the unions have planned a protest with black bands on Friday. On Saturday, a ‘Ram dhun’ will be held while a mass casual leave has been planned on Monday. 
 
 If the issues are not resolved in this period, the agitation will intensify from Tuesday. The protests coincides with the annual general board meeting for the VMC budget.
