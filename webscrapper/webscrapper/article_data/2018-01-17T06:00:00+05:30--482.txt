Visakhapatnam: In a move which could help accelerate Visakhapatnam’s transformation into a smart city, the Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC) is all set to install ‘smart poles’ across the city. One such pole has already been installed near Diamond Park junction. The   will be integrated with the ‘command and control centre’ (CCC), which is being set up as part of the Visakhapatnam smart city initiative at about Rs 150 crore.

 Each smart pole will comprise a fixed CCTV camera and one or two pan–tilt–zoom cameras (PTZ cameras) capable of capturing high definition remote directional and zoom control video surveillance, environmental sensors, Wi-Fi and hotspot, emergency call system, public announcement speakers, lamps, etc.
 
 The entire set-up will also ensure an advanced level of disaster alert and coordination management system. The CCC will respond in a coordinated manner, involving all related government agencies, during any kind of calamity or emergency. 
 
 On the other hand, the environmental sensors can collect and transmit data, including temperature, humidity, noise, air quality levels and others, to the CCC. The Wi-Fi and hotspots will give access to free internet to residents. These smart poles are designed in such a way to withstand wind speeds up to 225 kilometres an hour, so that they can work effectively during disasters such as cyclone Hudhud. These services will be provided through a single pole, without taking up extra space. It will also take the city a step forward toward leveraging Internet of things devices.
 
 GVMC commissioner M Hari Narayanan said that the majority of the residents of the city during the GVMC survey asked for a smart disaster management system and for that, they have taken up the command and communication centre project. 
 
 “The CCC, which primarily serves as an e-governance centre, would also double up as a disaster management centre,” said Hari Narayanan.
