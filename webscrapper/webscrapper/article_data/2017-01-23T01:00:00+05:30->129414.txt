Rakhi Sawant, who will soon leave for   to shoot for a French film, has bagged a Hindi film, titled 'Before Christmas', in which she will play a   drug addict. She says, “The trend is to essay challenging characters and I want to pick up unconventional roles. In the film, my character is someone who can do anything for drugs, be it getting involved with a guy half her age or making out with a girl.”

 Rakhi admits that she developed cold feet on learning that she will have to do intimate scenes. “I have never kissed on screen, so getting intimate was out of question. I am nervous about my 14-year-old nephew seeing me kiss a 16-year-old on screen. Having said that, sex and kissing are like art and don’t look vulgar when shot aesthetically,” she says.
