VARANASI:   remained suspended on Wednesday as the   went on a strike in   on popular ghats like   and  .

 The strike was in response to a call for a 24-hour strike by the Maa Ganga Nishadraj Seva Samiti Uttar Pradesh. Boatmen of all 84 ghats in Ramnagar, Sujabad, river Varuna and adjoining areas did not sail their boats on Wednesday.
 
 The jetties had been installed near the ghats to accommodate tourists flocking to watch the famed Ganga aarti. Addressing a meeting of boatmen, the organisation’s president, Vinod Kumar Nishad, said, “The jetties were assembled by an NGO with the help of a Mumbai-based company and are going to be placed parallel to Dashaswamedh, Sheetla and Prayag ghats. If the jetties are installed, the boatmen would lose the their livelihood.”
 
 The boatmen’s reaction comes despite assurances from divisional commissioner Nitin Ramesh Gokarn and regional tourism officer Ravindra Mishra that no jetty would be allowed to operate parallel to the ghats along Ganga. 
 
 The authorities have proposed that only those jetties, would be allowed on the ghats which will be used for tying the boats and help people in boarding the boats safely.
