SIVAGANGA: A group of people from a dominant community hacked two dalits to death and attacked several others, injuring six people grievously, at   near   in   district on Monday night. The deceased were identified as A Shanmuganathan, 31, and K Arumugam, 65.

 
 Police said the attack was the result of a scuffle between youths from the two communities on Saturday night. But the victims said it was an onslaught by the dominant community members as the dalits tried to break away from the shackles of caste discrimination.
 
 Police said a mob of around 20 people from   and its surrounding villages armed with sickles entered   village around 9.15 pm. Survivors said that the mob indiscriminately attacked every man who came their way. They entered the houses and brutally attacked the young men, who were their primary targets.
