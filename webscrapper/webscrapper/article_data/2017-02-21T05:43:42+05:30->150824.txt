MUMBAI: Several voters in for a surprise on Monday to find their names missing on the electoral rolls when they checked the state election commission's (SEC) website and the apps that have been launched by the poll panel.

 “My family didn't receive the voting slip that the election office doles out. The slip usually has details of polling booths so we checked and we were surprised not to find our names,“ said Ranjit Mehta from Garodia Nagar, Ghatkopar.
 
 Similar complaints were received from areas in   in Borivli where entire buildings were missing from the electoral rolls. “There was a massive clean-up drive organized by the   till January 2017. As many as 14 lakh voters were deleted as part of the campaign,“ said an official from the SEC office. “While the clean-up drive was aimed at deleting the names of people who have died or changed addresses, sometimes errors creep in. We have got the rolls from the central election commission and don't have the powers to add or delete any names,“ said the official.
 
 Residents said the voting percentage may be affected due to “names missing from the electoral rolls on a large-scale“. “After delimitation, many people do not know that their polling booths have changed due to changes in the ward com position. It may have a negative impact on would-be voters,“ said an activist.
 
 A voter from the minority community, who lives in Santacruz, said the election results could be skewed owing to “discrepancies in the rolls“.
 
 Senior citizen   from Colaba said the names of his two daughters did not figure on the rolls despite their re-registration. S R Surana, also from Colaba, said, “Our election slips do not bear the name or location of the voting booth, perhaps owing to delimitation. But my mother-in-law and father-in-law are in their 70s, so if we do not find our names at my regular centre, I do not know if I will take the trouble to transport them to multiple locations.“
