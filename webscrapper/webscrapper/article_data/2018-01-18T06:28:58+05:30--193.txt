MANALI: The multicrore   project, which raked up a controversy in Manali, may face another setback as forest and transport minister   on Wednesday said government would establish it at the right place.

 “The ropeway could not be established till date because people are opposing it and have no interest in it. I was always with the local people, who feel (it is a) threat to their employment and livelihood. The ropeway will definitely be set up in Manali. But it will connect a destination that has not been connected by road,” he said.
 
 Referring to   ( ) orders, he assured the villagers that he would stay by their in all situations. The people in Manali have seen worse times and had to move to court for protection of their rights, but now he would take care of everything, the minister said.
 
 Thakur was speaking on tourism in upper Manali, where over 90% population is dependent on this sector. “Tourists will now be able to visit the deodar forests even at night. The forests in surrounding areas would be illuminated. Small speakers would be fixed and tourists will hear Himachali folk songs in the midst of nature. A huge nature park on 200 bigha land near Manali will be developed and 122 bigha muck dumping site of   tunnel project will be developed as adventure sports site. And indoor stadium would be built here and many more projects would be developed for convenience and entertainment of tourists,” he said.
