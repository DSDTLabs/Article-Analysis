LUDHIANA: Staff of Captain   Government Senior Secondary School, Dhamot, Payal, have accused its   and her husband of misbehaving with them. The staff alleged that the principal’s husband sits in the office, interferes in school work and misbehaves with them.

 On Saturday, the entire staff got together and questioned the principal and her husband and threatened to call the panchayat. The couple fled and has not returned since then. A video capturing the tussle between the school staff, principal and her husband has also gone viral. 
 
 The staff, on Monday, filed a complaint against principal   with the education department. Deputy district education officer (secondary) Charanjit Singh reached the school on Tuesday for an inquiry. 
 
 In their complaint (a copy of which is with the TOI), the staff alleged that Jasvir Kaur, who joined the school on February 19, 2018, misbehaves with them and refuses to sign any document. Rather she forces them to sign the registers and other documents without reading them. Her husband accompanies her to the school and remains in office the whole day, they alleged. “He interferes in all documentary work. The couple sits in the record room and locks it from inside,” they added. 
 
 A schoolteacher said, “The principal always refuses to sign any leave application. Recently, she refused to sign the roll numbers of Class X students and also their practical copies, which is mandatory. Half of her work is done by her husband. The couple is rude with the staff.”
 
 Another schoolteacher said they had been tolerating the misbehaviour for long and on Saturday, they united against them.
 
 Deputy DEO (secondary) Charanjit Singh said, “On the complaint of the staff, I came to the school for inquiry against the principal.”
 
 In their complaint, the staff has also said that the “principal seemed mentally unstable, and therefore should be transferred”.
