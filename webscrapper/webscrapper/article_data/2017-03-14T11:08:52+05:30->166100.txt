NANDYAL: Paying tribute to departed legislator  , chief minister N   has said that TDP has lost one of its loving family members. 

 Naidu, paid his last respects to the mortal remains of Nagi Reddy and attended the departed leader's funeral at Allagadda on Monday. He consoled the children of Nagi Reddy including local legislator Akhilapriya. A visibly saddened chief minister was unable to control his emotions on seeing Reddy's body and broke down. "I have lost one of my dearest family members. Nagi Reddy had never asked me for any position. He fought for the party till the end," he said and recalled how a young Nagi Reddy responded to his call to take on then prime minister   in the   elections in 1996. "He did not think even for a minute when I asked him to get ready to take on the prime minister. He had not only accepted the party's call but also took it as a challenge to see that the party wins almost every election," the Naidu said.
 
 He said that he himself was surprised when Nagi Reddy was prepared to take part in the by-elections within months of losing an election against P V Narasimha Rao. He said Nagi Reddy had always walked that extra mile to enhance the party's prestige. Nagi Reddy used to request him to resolve the people's grievances of Allagadda and Nandyal whenever he met him.
