INDORE: In a   on   while riding or driving their vehicles,   caught more than 1,200 motorists in violation of this rule in past four months. All of them were caught during surprise drives held from January to April, 2017.

 Figures with police department say 1,209 motorists were caught using their phones while driving/riding their vehicles. The drive has generated a revenue of Rs.6 lakh for the police department. Around 810 motorists were caught using phones during the same period last year.
 
 “Most violators were two wheeler riders,” said DSP (traffic) Pradeep Singh Chouhan. He added that a fine of Rs 500 was collected from each violator, and their licences will also be suspended if they are found violating the rule again.
 
 Surprise drives have been conducted by   police to check if drivers use their phones while on the move. The drives come close on the heels of their ongoing drive against drunk driving. The transport department officials had also requested the transport commissioner to strictly implement the existing law that bars motorists from using their phones while they are on the go.
 
 Department authorities had earlier approached senior officials to direct local traffic police to start a drive to control the violation. “The government is making amendments in the central motor vehicle rule. This will allow the transport department to immediately cancel a violator’s licence if they are found using their phones,” said an RTO official.
