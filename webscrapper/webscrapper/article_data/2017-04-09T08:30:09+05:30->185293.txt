MUMBAI: The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) has asked the BMC to keep 2% of the total   road project cost—around Rs 300 crore—with   for conservation of coastal and marine biodiversity before starting work. The ministry has asked the civic body to get a reputed academic institution, which is affiliated to the  , to develop a marine biodiversity conservation plan.

 Although the first phase of the coastal road—Marine Lines to Worli—does not have any mangroves, the   stretch will require destruction of several mangroves. Earlier, the coastal zone authority had asked the BMC to plant five times the mangroves they would be destroying. However, the BMC managed to convince the authority to amend the order and now, it needs to plant only three times the mangroves they will cut to reclaim land for the project.
 
 Activists have been opposing land reclamation and claimed that the government doesn’t even have a plan to preserve the coastal ecosystem.
 
 Environmentalist D   said, “There is no plan on how and where they are going to plant the mangroves. There is no land left for it along the city’s coastline, except on salt pans. If they plant the mangroves on salt pans, birds visiting the area will vanish. The authority has no plan to preserve the coastal ecology. Instead of building a road on reclaimed land, the government should go for construction on a stilt as it will put less pressure on the shores. The idea of reclaiming land from muck is a disastrous one. It is not done anywhere in a developed country. It is ridiculous and unscientific.”
 
 Officials, however, said they are building a seawall after reclaiming land, which will protect the shore and nearby areas. The BMC will go up to 100m into the sea to reclaim land for the propsed road. The BMC has also proposed to construct box-drainage at various points to help flush out water during heavy rains in areas near the proposed road.
