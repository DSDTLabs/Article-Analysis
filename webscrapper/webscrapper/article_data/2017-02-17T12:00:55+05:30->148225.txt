 has been rumoured to be dating businessman   for months now, but there was no confirmation on the same. However, it looks like the rumoured lovebirds are now ready to go public with their relationship as the businessman was recently spotted attending Karisma’s father Randhir Kapoor’s birthday bash. 

 Karisma and Sandeep made their first appearance together late last year during a casual house party. If reports and pictures doing the rounds online are anything to go by, the actress took daddy Randhir’s birthday party as an opportunity to introduce her new man to her family and close friends. The businessman made a solo appearance but was later joined by Karisma at the bash. We hear, the two kept close the entire night as they mingled and mixed with guests at the party. Some reports have even gone on to suggest that the Kapoors have given Lolo’s new man their nod of approval.
