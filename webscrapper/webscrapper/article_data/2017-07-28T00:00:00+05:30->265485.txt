A few decades ago, only the rich and privileged were fortunate enough to hire someone to drive them around the city or country. Improved standard of living and technology has now made it easier to be driven around by a chauffeur, even if you are not a king. Such a concept has existed for a long time in the molecular biology field, where one molecule is used to “carry” or “deliver” another to its destination. Scientists are also trying to personalize medicine by fine-tuning  , and have now developed a “smart” drug that can be “driven” directly to the liver to suck up the fat from its cells.

 Researchers at Helmholtz Zentrum München and Technische Universität München focused on the mechanics of metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes, particularly with reference to the accumulation of fat in the liver (fatty liver) and blood vessels (atherosclerosis).   (T3) is well known for its ability to metabolize fat. However, its deleterious effects on the skeleton and blood vessels had, so far, prevented it from being used, in the clinical setting, to reverse fat accumulation. In their study, the scientists used a hormone found in the pancreas,  , to drive T3 only into cells that contain the receptor for glucagon, such as cells in the liver. Thus, by limiting T3 to the liver, the heart and bone cells were safe from the damage caused by T3; at the same time, liver cells that had accumulated fat were rid of it by the metabolizing actions of T3. When used in obese mice, the drug improved cholesterol and glucose metabolism, reduced body weight, and reversed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, without damage to the heart and bone, within a short period of time. While these results need to be replicated in humans before the drug can be marketed, the results of this study open up exciting avenues for future research. 
 
 With this discovery, individualized medicine is no longer the stuff of sci-fi novels.
