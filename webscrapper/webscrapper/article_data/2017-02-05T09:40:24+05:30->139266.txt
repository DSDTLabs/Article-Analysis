HYDERABAD: In a tragic incident, a two-year-old boy fell and drowned in an open stormwater drain at Quareshi Lane near   at Yakutpura on Saturday afternoon. 

 Around 3pm, the victim,  , was playing near the drain when he went missing, said the Rein Bazaar police, under whose limits the incident took place. 
 
 "Locals told us that the boy was playing outside his house and must have slipped into the drain. His parents were looking for his body for over an hour. In the afternoon, they saw his body surface in the stormwater drain," Rein Bazaar inspector G Ramesh said. The boy's father   is a driver.
 
 Since the parents of the boy had not filed an official complaint, the police did not taken anyone into custody. 
 
 When contacted about the open drain, GHMC zonal commissioner (south)   told STOI: "There was no retaining wall for the drain. After the rains last year, we had built a compound wall at the mouth of the nala, but not around it. Since the houses are located very close to each other, it has not been possible for us to build a wall on the banks of the nala."
