Actress   says her children take after her, but only when they are good. The actress and her husband   are parents to two children, seven-year-old daughter Charlotte and four-year-old son Rocky, and she has praised her kids for being well behaved, but jokingly blamed Freddie for spoiling them. 

  
  
 "When they're good, they take after me. And when they're being naughty, they take after Freddie, obviously. Yeah, it's true,"   jokingly said. The 39-year-old actress says her children hate it when she takes out her phone camera, as no-one in their family likes having their photo taken. 
 
 "You know, I don't think anybody in my family, including myself, loves getting their picture taken. My kids don't even like the phone (camera). They're like, 'Ugh! No more pictures. God, mom!". One thing the family does share in common, however, is a love of cooking. 
 
 "I think for us, it's been a really great bonding. And I think, for my kids, it's been great to see, having an idea, starting from scratch, and actually making it into something tangible."
 
 "(Freddie is) a culinary whiz! He's a chef. For me, it's about taking away the intimidation factor. I can't cook like him. I'm never gonna try. This is for people who - even from novice to expert, it's just creative ways to get your creative juices flowing."
