GAYA: Panic prevailed at Manjhar village in Tekari sub- division following detection of two bomb-like objects outside the main gate of a government high school on Monday morning. The area was cordoned off and   disposal squad lifted the bombs. All classes were suspended and the students were asked to go home.

 Gaya SSP Garima Malik said one of the objects turned out to be a ‘thread ball’, while the other object was a stainless steel container tightly wired from outside. “The possibility of the steel container too being innocuous like the ‘thread ball’ cannot be ruled out. But we cannot take a chance and the objects would be neutralised through protocol required to handle explosives,” the SSP said, adding that a report has been sought from Tekari SDPO.
