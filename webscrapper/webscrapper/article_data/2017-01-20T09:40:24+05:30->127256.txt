PATNA: Over two months after demonetisation, which was supported by CM  , and just ahead of the assembly polls in UP and Punjab, the   on Thursday indicated it has no truck with Nitish’s JD (U).

 The “clarification” over the reported bonhomie between the two allies-turned-rivals, has come two days before the party’s two-day state executive committee meeting to be held from January 21 at Siwan. The district, incidentally, was till recently considered a stronghold of former   MP Mohd Shahabuddin, currently behind bars. 
 
 “Several issues are on the agenda, and they include deteriorating law and order situation and mismanagement of paddy procurement and problems faced by farmers in the state,” said state BJP president  . 
 
 Rai also condemned the killing of two people, including a BJP functionary, by criminals wielding AK-47 near Pakridayal in Motihari on Wednesday.
 
 Former state BJP chief Mangal Pandey said the party’s Siwan meet would expose the reality of CM Nitish Kumar’s ‘Saat Nishchay’ (seven resolves) initiative. “The CM is indulging only in propaganda in the name of this so-called development intitiave,” he said, adding Siwan has been selected as the venue as a mark of protest against deteriorating law and order in the state. 
 
 Nitish’s support to notebandi had led to discussions and speculations over the BJP and JD (U) coming together. What added to the speculations was the fact that the BJP went soft on Nitish in the assembly during its winter session. As if that was not enough, PM   praised Nitish on the issue of prohibition.
 
 The BJP supported total prohibition, but insisted on annulment of certain “draconian” provisions in the liquor law. 
 
 The party will join the human chain being formed on January 21 in support of prohibition. However, Rai said it was “bad and not proper” to force students and teachers to join the human chain, as was being done by a few district education officers, including that of Rohtas.
