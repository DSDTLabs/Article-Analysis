RANCHI:   wore a satisfied smile on Monday and he had all the reasons to do so. After all it's not everyday that a visiting side walks away with a draw after managing to bat out an entire day in the dustbowls of India. In the  , his team did just that.

 "They just stuck to their game-plan and their defence. The way   and Marsh backed their defence it was really good," said Smith. "I am very proud of them.
 
 "We talked a lot about resilience and sticking through the tough times. They were simply outstanding," said Smith.
 
 The mind games against the Indians though didn't cease to exist and Smith made it clear in as many words. "If there is something called momentum then it is right with us. India would have expected to bowl us out on such a wicket. In their dressing room they would be hurting a bit as that did not turn out," he said.
 
 Talking about his own dismissal - shouldering arms to   - the Australian captain added, "It wasn't an ideal scenario to get out with two set batters getting dismissed. We spoke about not getting out in clumps but I had faith in Handscomb and the other batsmen. He played beautifully and stuck to his plans."
 
 With the wickets playing the main topic of debate in this series, Smith expressed surprise that the game lasted five days while praising the groundsman. "I didn't expect it to last five days. Credit to the groundsman. He had been telling us that it would. It was a nice wicket with rough outside the righthander's leg stump and lefthander's off-stump," he said.
 
 On whether the game was played in the right spirit, Smith said, "A little bit of tension will always be there in an India-Australia encounter. There were tensions but it is no issue."
