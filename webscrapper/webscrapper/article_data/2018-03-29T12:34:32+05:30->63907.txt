JAIPUR: Rajasthan State Archives,   ( ) will translate archival   into Hindi. This will help the present generation to clearly understand the documents. The department is developing a software which will convert the local languages of the erstwhile rulers — Marwari, Dundhari, Hadauti, Mewati and Bangdi in Hindi. The software will be ready in the coming months.

 “Over the years these local languages have lost their charm and are not spoken much even in the traditional families. The lack of understanding of these languages is making these documents unused. Special software will convert the content into Hindi language,” said Mahendra Singh  , director of RSAB.
 
 The centre has lakhs of archival documents in these local languages relating to history, culture, food, war and administrative documents. In fact, these documents are required for settling court cases, identifying the properties and interpreting ancient wisdom of our generations. These documents are mostly related to the erstwhile royal families of Kota, Bikaner, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Pali, Sirohi, Alwar etc.
 
 As the documents are in the local languages which are fast becoming redundant, this has resulted in making the use of the documents limited. “The documents have several untold stories which deserve to be known by people. The water conservation practices in   language can solve the present water crises problem. The agricultural practices in arid regions or crops using less water in the traditional language requires to be consumed by the people,” said Khadgawat
 
 The move will help the researchers, royal families and locals to unite with the past. The digital archives can be accessed by everyone by registering on the RSAB website. After registration, over 1 crore digital documents can be accessed and downloaded.
