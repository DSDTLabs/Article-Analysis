Vadodara: A businessman dealing in ceramics from Padra was booked at Sayajigunj police station on Saturday for cheating a former employee of credit society and her colleague to the tune of Rs 7.55 lakh. The accused had conned them in name of starting an online start-up business.

 The complainant Hiral Shah told the police in her complaint that she came in contact with the accused Girish Pawar through a friend. She and her colleague Anant Sankude met Pawar in June 2015 at a café in Alkapuri where Pawar shared his start-up idea. A police official said that Pawar had plans to start an online portal business for which he needed money.
 
 In the same year in August, they again had a meeting at a hotel in Sayajigunj where Pawar proposed that if Shah and Sankude would invest in the business, he will give them gold and one per cent interest per day for 200 days. Lured by the offer, Shah paid Rs 2.34 lakh in different amounts until March 2016 while Sankude paid Rs 5.21 lakh.
 
 When the company did not start, Shah and Sankude asked Pawar to return the money. He promised to return it in two months’ time. However, even then he did not return the money. When the duo again approached Pawar, they were allegedly threatened with life by him.
 
 Cops said that in her statement, Shah has said that she did not register the complaint after more than a year as she did not have knowledge about the law.
 
 “We are gathering evidences against Pawar and taking statements of the complainants and others. Once that is done, we will arrest Pawar,” said N R Patel, police sub-inspector, Sayajigunj police station.
