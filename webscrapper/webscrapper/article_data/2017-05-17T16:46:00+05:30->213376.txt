 said she does not like using the phrase "it's ok" around her toddlers. The 36-year-old   says she feels these words often leave children confused and they cannot understand what they feel when they hear the phrase.

  
  
 "I do really like re-evaluating how much we say to them, 'It's OK,' because it weirdly shuts down their ability to have emotions. Because they think, 'It's OK. I shouldn't be embarrassed. I shouldn't be sad.'"
 
 "So now when they get sad or embarrassed, I say, 'That's a stinky feeling ? I've felt it, too.' I just let them experience it, and hopefully it'll make healthy adults (sic)" said Kristen. 
 
 The 'Bad Moms' star has two daughters, four-year-old Lincoln and Delta, two, with actor husband Dax Shepard.
