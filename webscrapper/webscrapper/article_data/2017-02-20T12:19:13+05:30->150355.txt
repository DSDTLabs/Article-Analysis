MALAPPURAM: Indian Union Muslim League ( ) will intensify its   demanding restoration of   in Karipur. 

 The national treasurer of the party P K Kunhalikkutty said that all MLAs of the party will take part in the day-long fast in protest against the decision of the Centre to avoid Karipur as a haj embarkation point. The protest will be held at Karipur International Airport on Tuesday.
 
 Addressing media here on Sunday, Kunhalikkutty said that the Centre was biased in allowing haj embarkation points and the party will continue protests until the Union government consider the demand of the state haj committee.
 
 The annual haj pact signed by India and Saudi Arabia did not include   as one of the embarkation points. The tender issued by the Union ministry on last Friday also stated that Keralaâ€™s only haj embarkation point would be Kochi, drawing wide criticism from various corners. A meeting of the state haj committee held on Saturday had decided to meet the Union ministers, in the coming days.
 
 Kunnhalikkutty has pointed out that many centres which have already been declared as haj embarkation points by the union government have less facilities as compared to Karipur airport. He said that the efforts of state government to restore the embarkation point here is yet to yield results and until then UDF will go ahead with its protest programmes. The protest by IUML on Tuesday would be inaugurated by Panakkad Hyderali Shihab Thangal.
