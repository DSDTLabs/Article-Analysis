Chandigarh: With the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation (MC) going for the national   survey, it has started distributing the work among various officers concerned.

 Besides this, several employees and officers of sanitation wing have also been roped in for minute inspection of each area. The officers have already started working on this.
 
 “As the entire city is being inspected, responsibilities have been distributed. We have been giving focus on the areas like slums, colonies and located in the periphery. Engineering officers along with several senior officers have been roped in for this task so that we can score good grades in the survey,” said a senior MC official.
 
 Sources at the civic department revealed that besides sanitation, availability of toilets in the city is also one of the most crucial components. The civic body has already installed temporary toilets at almost all the slums areas. The authority is also in the process to construct public toilets in the areas, where required.
