MUMBAI:   has slammed the state government's decision to sign an agreement with an aviation firm to procure AugustaWestland helicopters for VVIPs. 

 Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant slammed the government for double speak on corruption. "  was the first to launch an attack on the UPA government in the AugustaWestland deal and now, VVIPs of the   government will fly in the same helicopters," he said.
 
 On May 4, the general administration department, which is led by Fadnavis, issued an order to provide for an agreement with two firms that will provide aircraft and helicopters for the use of VVIPs, including the governor and the CM.
 
 Sawant pointed out that in the wake of criticism, the UPA government had in 2014 initiated the process to blacklist controversial firms. In fact, the probe against the firms was entrusted to the   and enforcement directorate. "UPA government had initiated criminal proceedings.Shockingly , the   government failed to take the probe further. On the contrary , the controversial firms were encouraged during Make In India event," Sawant said.
 
 BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said it appears that Sawant has not done his homework before making allegations."The state government has engaged two agencies for providing aircraft and helicopters. Due process of law has been followed while finalising the two firms. In fact, e-tenders were issued and then the two firms were selected. The two firms are not even remotely associated with AugustsWestland. For movement of VVIPs, use of twin engine is mandatory , under such circumstances, it is for the two firms to provide aircraft and helicopters. The government process is completely transparent and the order is available online," he said.
