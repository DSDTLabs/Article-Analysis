New Delhi: The  , maker of   cigarettes and operator of Twenty Four convenience stores, plans to open 500   stores across India through a franchisee model. 

 In addition, it is rebuilding its ‘round-the-clock’ stores from the ground-up at an approximate cost of Rs 1 crore per store. On the cards is a tie-up with  , an airline caterer, for food and a digital makeover for interiors. 
 
 “We want to change the perception of these stores and make them comparable with the best in Europe,” Samir Modi, executive director at Modi Enterprises, told TOI. However, he did not divulge the figures for the makeover. 
 
 Modi said the new stores will boast refrigerators with LED panels and smokeless kitchens among other state-of-the-art facilities. The challenge with expansion, he said, is logistics associated with fresh food products.
 
 Currently, the New Delhi-headquartered company, runs around 50 stores in Delhi NCR and Chandigarh. It has an agreement with petrol pump chain   to open stores at its filling stations. Its closest rival, In & Out, managed by state-owned  , operates around 150 stores. 
 
 Modi, the youngest son of industrialist Krishna Kumar Modi, had earlier given hints of his desire to expand the conglomerate’s retail arm, which contributes a small portion to the group’s overall business.
 
 Modi had also hired five-member team from Japan as consultants for Twenty Four Seven. The team had been advisers to Japan-based convenience store retail chain   that operates over 50,000 stores across 18 countries.
