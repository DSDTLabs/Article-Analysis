NEW DELHI:   Chairman M   has set up a two-member committee for a comprehensive review of the rules to deal with serial disruptors and frequent stalling of proceedings by political parties that has hit functioning of the upper House.

 Rajya Sabha secretary-general Desh Deepak Verma on Monday said that unlike in the case of  , there is no provision for suspending unruly members. An official release quoting Verma said there is no specific provision for automatic suspension of members who “persistently and wilfully” obstruct House proceedings by shouting slogans or otherwise by entering the Well.
 
 The absence of the provision to suspend members leaves the chair with the choice of either adjourning the House or using the problematic option of marshalling them out. The ejection of members was resorted to during the passage of the women’s reservation bill but led to a strong outcry.
 
 “ When there is disruption in the House, passage of a bill becomes difficult. Current Rules of Procedure relating to voting procedure on the bill become inadequate in such a situation,” the release said.
 
 In the past two sessions, the upper House had been largely dysfunctional as opposition parties raised issues such as the   scam, protests by Andhra and Telangana MPs and the Cauvery water dispute.
