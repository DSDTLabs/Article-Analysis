Swarms of mosquitoes that hover around you in a market or a public place are a result of choked drains and sewer lines brimming with waste, polythene and garbage.   should have ideally begun cleaning of drains from February but the process is still delayed. As a result, the drains are providing fertile ground for growth of mosquito larvae.

 Lucknow has 26 big drains which need cleaning twice every year, considering the huge sewage flow in them. The city also has about 1,800km of smaller drains which channelise household sludge to Bharwara STP. These should be cleaned everyday but in reality, they are rarely cleaned. There are many colonies where drains were cleaned months ago while in others, sanitary workers often refuse to clean small drains.
 
 Poonam Jethwani, a resident of  , said, “All drains in my colony are overflowing with garbage. Vegetable and street vendors dump waste in them and   rarely cleans them. In the evening, you can see swarms of mosquitoes buzzing near drains.” She said even top floors of apartments were suffering from mosquito menace.
 
  of Sarvodayanagar is concerned about her children’s health.
 
 “My house is close to   drain. You would always see sanitary workers dump garbage on its banks, which have become a breeding place for mosquitoes. It’s difficult to sleep at night because of constant mosquito bites,” she said.
 
 Even in drains which are cleaned, workers do not removing silt completely but keep it on the side to dry. The dry silt should be removed in a day or two but it is left as it is, attracting mosquitoes.
 
 Posh localities such as Gomtinagar and Dalibagh also had several complaints.
