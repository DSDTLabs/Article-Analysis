BHOPAL: A leopard was found dead under mysterious circumstances in   (BTR) of Madhya Pradesh on Friday.

 The carcass was found near Marjadgarh area in   range and was in a decomposed status.
 
 While senior officials could not be contacted, insiders say that the leopard was around 10-year old and was spotted moving around in the same region for the last one month. Autopsy report is awaited.
 
 Many believe leopard is one of the most widely recognized cats after tigers and its days may be numbered in Madhya Pradesh. Thanks to poaching, retaliatory killing, conflicts with farmers followed by weak investigations, the spotted feline may soon qualify for ‘vulnerable’ status.
 
 MP has lost more than 100 leopards in the last two years, some of which were trapped, axed and electrocuted to death for hides and nails. The frequent deaths have prompted wildlife activists to call for conservation programmes for leopards in line with those conducted for tigers.
 
 Wildlife activist   had even written a letter to the Union minister for forest and environment (Moef), to constitute a special cell or wing at national level for their protection.
 
 Maximum casualties were reported in the year 2011 (43) of which 17 were killed by poachers in Seoni, Balaghat, Burhanpur, Barwani, Mandla, Sehore, Panna, Hoshangabad and Barwah forest areas. Six years on, the toll is going up.
 
 Poor investigation by inexperienced and unresourceful rangers has led to submission of week chargesheets in most of the cases, said wildlife experts, adding that the conviction level in poaching cases in MP is below 5%. The poaching figures could have been much more if all cases of leopard deaths are investigated properly. Allegedly, in most of the cases, officers shy away from registering a poaching case.
