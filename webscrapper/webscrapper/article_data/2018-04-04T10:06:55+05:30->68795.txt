CHARMINAR: Poor condition of the   stretch in front of   function hall is giving a tough time to motorists.

 Shopkeepers told TOI that more than the deplorable state of the road, formation of dust clouds due to traffic movement is affecting   visibility.
 
 The potholes were recently filled with mud to ensure a smooth ride, but on the contrary they are emanating dust, creating problems for motorists. According to locals, users of heavy vehicles are the most affected as the condition of the stretch results in minor accidents during peak hours.
 
 “The sorry state of the road causes inconvenience to motorists. Potholes and mud on the roadside gives them a tough time and passing through the stretch has become a challenge . Though everyone is aware of the pathetic condition of this road, no initiatives have been taken to lay new roads or repair the stretch,'' said  , a shopkeeper.
 
 The traffic moving towards Shamshabad, Aramgarh and other parts of the city have to take the bad thoroughfare on their way to the respective destinations.
 
 “I use this route daily to reach my workshop at Aramgarh. But worse condition of the road upsets us most. It does seem that the stretch have been neglected by the   (GHMC) authorities. This road needs immediate repair or else authorities should lay a new road to ensure smooth passage for motorists,'' said a regular motorist Mushtaq.
