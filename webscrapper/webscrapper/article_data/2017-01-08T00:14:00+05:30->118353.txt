KOLHAPUR: The regional transport office will be observing the annual road safety programme from January 9 to January 23.

 Programmes varying from enlightening lectures to different kinds of competitions focusing road safety have been organised during the fortnightly event.
 
 Despite of the annual  , roads in   are in a bad shape. Increased traffic congestion has made it difficult for motorist to travel during the peak office hours. The situation has become difficult for pedestrians as vehicles due to lack of space move on the walking path on the road.
 
 Especially the youngsters do not follow the traffic norms. They hardly follow the seep limit, and other traffic rules. Therefore, road safety might help these youngsters follow the traffic norm to curb rising accidents.
 
  (RTO) DT Pawar said, “During the fortnightly event, we have arranged various programmes on spreading awareness about safe driving. Our motor inspectors will be visiting colleges and schools across the city to spread traffic norm awareness.”
 
 He said, “Even daily motorist are unaware about various road signs. In total, there are 90 road signs a driver must be aware off. We want to create awareness about all major signs and rules during the event.”
 
 He added, “Besides organising  , we have organised essay writing and drawing competition on road safety. We will employ our inspectors on the highway to keep a check on overloaded vehicles.”
