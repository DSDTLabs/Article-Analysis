So when we told him, we received thousands of entries from fans, whom he fondly addresses as `Yashians', willing to go on a shopping spree with him, he wasn't as surprised as anyone else would be.For the final leg of   With The Stars contest, the Tollywood heartthrob gave his lucky fan   Bhowmik company on a sunny Thursday afternoon. With Durga Puja only a day away , the star and fan duo shopped till they dropped! We headed to a popular shopping complex, where Yash was already waiting. “Is this happening for real?
 
  Am I about to embark on a shopping spree with my favourite actor?“ said Arpita, while she tried to gather herself on seeing her idol. “It's true! Let's start with Puja staple, phuchka, shall we?“ said Yash as he gave Arpita a warm hug. A brief felicitation at the mall and countless selfies later, they went on to browse through bags, dresses and blazers at the shops. “I'll buy whatever YD chooses for me,“ said Arpita, when asked what she would like to buy for herself. “Then you are in safe hands, Arpita. My choice is rather good!“ said Yash with a smile. On being asked what she loves about Yash, an elated Arpita didn't know where to start from. “I love him because he's humble and treats his fans like his friends. How many stars do that in today's time?“ she asked. To this, Yash added, “It's heartening to receive so much love from people who have only seen me on screen -people, I don't know if I'll ever meet in my life. It's something that cannot be bought. I feel very lucky.“
 
  Post shopping, we made our way to a south Kolkata cafe for a scrumptious lunch. Over scrumptious continental delicacies and conversations, a great day drew to an end. As it was time for Yash to bid adieu, Arpita gave him a hug and said, “Shopping, lunch and a hearty chat -the day felt like a date! I will never forget it!“ Follow us on   (FB) and Calcutta_ Times (Twitter) for more updates on #ShopWith TheStars.
