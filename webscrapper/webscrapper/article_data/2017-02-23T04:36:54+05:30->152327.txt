GANDHINAGAR: The Gujarat government’s controversial Metro-rail Express for   (MEGA) project, which had lost around Rs 1,000 crore to a scam earlier, spent Rs 1,354.01 crore in the last two years (2015 and 2016), according to information the government divulged in the state assembly on Wednesday.

 In a written response to a question by   about the total expenditure on   rail project in the last two years, deputy CM Nitin   said Rs 407.18 crore was spent in 2015 and Rs 946.83 crore in 2016.
 
 To a further question by Rajput, on the status of the project and time frame for completion, Patel said, “Metro rail project work is in progress and the metro will be started in phases. In the first phase, 6km of the east-west corridor, from Vastral to Apparel Park, is expected to be completed by end of 2017.
 
 Rajput said: “Gujarat government needs to give information on the status of recovery of Rs 1,000 crore swindled by former chairman of MEGA and others responsible. Moreover, the Gujarat government has not clarified how many more years it will take to complete the project, if just 6km will be complete by the end of 2017..”
