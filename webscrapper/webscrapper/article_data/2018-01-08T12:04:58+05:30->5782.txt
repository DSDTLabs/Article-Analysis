KERI: Social activists and villagers from Sattari, who assembled at Gosanvardhan Kendra Nanus-Valpoi, expressed their apprehension over Goa government’s recent move to discuss with   the issue of sharing water from the river  . They urged the government not to initiate any step to opt for an out of tribunal settlement as it will hamper the state’s interest in the matter.

 At a meeting convened by NGO Aamhi Goenkar, activists unanimously decided to stand against Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar’s recent letter to   chief B S Yeddyurappa stating that he is open to talks on the issue of sharing drinking water, but within the parameters of the Mhadei tribunal.
 
  zilla panchayat member   said, “Many areas on the banks of Mhadei are facing acute shortage of drinking water. The government should solve the drinking water crisis instead of working out amicable settlements.”
