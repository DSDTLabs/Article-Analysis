 The drive is also focused on nailing pickpockets, touts and commuters defacing metro property. In December and January, 735 people were fined by the CISF for such offences — including 18 cases of eve-teasing on metro premises and 641 cases of men entering women’s coaches.
 
 “We are looking at all aspects to make commuters feel safer, women in particular. In most cases, women passengers come to a CISF official complaining about harassment and action is taken on the spot. However, most don’t feel the need to file a complaint. Similarly, more focus is being made on women’s coaches to deter men from entering it,” said a senior CISF official.
 
 CISF said most men pretend that they were unaware it was the women’s coach or say they were in a hurry. The fines against such commuters range between Rs 200 to 500.
 
 For women coaches, CISF has a special alpha squad which generally consists of female CISF officials. For other offences, flying squads are used, an official said.
 
 In the last two months, CISF personnel have also fined 29 people for defacing metro property, with five cases of touting and 42 cases of pickpocketing also recorded across the stations in Delhi NCR. Officials said the increase in number of teams has helped capture more offenders. “Earlier, we had very few teams but this number has increased last year and it has helped secure the metro premises in a better way,” said the official.
