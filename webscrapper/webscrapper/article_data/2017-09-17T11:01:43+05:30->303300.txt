DEHRADUN: The man whose name had become synonymous with a string of kidney rackets throughout the country for the past two decades -from   to  , Nepal, Punjab and eventually   -was nabbed by Dehradun police early Saturday morning from Panchkula in Haryana.

 The arrest of the man who is believed to have assumed different identities over the years -Amit Kumar, Amit Raut and Santosh Raut to name a few -came five days after an interstate racket with international links being run by him from the   on the outskirts of the city was busted by police.
 
 Kumar, 61, had managed to escape along with his associates on September 11 when his illegal trade was exposed, but police on Saturday , after a frenetic search operation across states, nabbed him along with his brother Jeevan, a nurse named Sarlaand Pradeep alias Billu, and his driver. Two luxury cars and over Rs 33 lakh in cash were also seized from their possession.
 
 The brazenness with which Kumar operated his rackets and preyed on the kidneys of the poor -even after being arrested multiple times in the past -had led him to be labelled as `Dr Horror.' He was the mastermind behind the multi-crore Gurgaon kidney scandal that was busted in January 2008 when a labourer in Moradabad complained of being harassed by Kumar's men for his kidney . Kumar had then fled the country and was later arrested from Chitwan in Nepal after his attempt to bribe the cops fell through.
 
 In 2013, a CBI special court while terming him a “quack“ sentenced him to seven-year rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 60 lakh. He was granted bail a year later in 2014. After his release, he shifted base to Anand in Gujarat where he is alleged to have lured poor villagers -his modus operandi in all his operations -to give their kidneys.
