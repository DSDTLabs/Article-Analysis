KOLKATA: Police brass has decided to single out and take strict action against all buses that run on re-soled tyres. The move came in the wake of a minibus jumping on to the pavement and crushing a pedestrian’s leg on  . Prima facie, the investigation has revealed that brakes did not apply on the re-soled tyres of the bus, forcing the driver to swerve to his left.

 According to sources, Kolkata’s 25 traffic guards regularly record around 150-400 cases of re-soled tyres. “We usually invoke section 94 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act that deal with defective gears. That’s more than 7,500 cases a month in the city,” claimed an officer, adding they have been compounding the challans of late — Rs 100 for the first offence, Rs 250 for the next and so on.
 
 When asked how are the buses managing to ply if they are being penalized, cops explained that the fines hardly act as a deterrent. Citing examples, an officer explained: “The minibus that overturned on   in June had 241 citation cases, seven compound cases and one sticker case. The one that had crashed near Howrah bridge in April had 757 citation cases pending with police, 490 pending with court and 26 compound cases.”
 
 
  
 
 Sources said buses plying from Howrah are mostly registered from Howrah RTO. “The buses easily get certified even with wheels on rent, as is mostly the case,” claimed a Lalbazar officer. The Howrah RTO though denied these claims saying that police did little after owners get their buses registered. The selling happens only after the inspection is over,” said an officer.
 
 Moreover, getting a fitness certificate for a rickety buses, say sources, is far easier — and cheaper — than making the vehicle fit for the certificate. 
 
 DC (traffic)   said a detailed crackdown has been planned. “A lot of cars are breaking down on Maa flyover after the mastic relaying. We found that on several occassions, re-soled tyres were the culprits. We have decided to be strict on this issue,” said Kumar.
