MUMBAI: Merely twisting a woman's hand or catching hold of a corner of her saree during a quarrel cannot be said to be outraging her modesty, the   has ruled. Justice Anant Badar said that the prosecution has to prove that the accused intended or knew that his act would affect the modesty of a woman. The judge acquitted a father-son duo from Lonavla of the charges of outraging the modesty of a woman in a decade-old case. 

 "The test will be whether a reasonable man will think that the act of the accused was intended to or was known to be likely to outrage the modesty of the woman," said Justice Badar. "If a quarrel takes place suddenly, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed, then, by no stretch of imagination can it be held that in the resultant scuffle between the quarrelling parties, the accused persons either intended or knew it to be likely that they will thereby outrage the modesty the woman."
 
 The case dates back to 2006 when Swarupchand Kankaria and his son Rajesh were booked for outraging the modesty (section 354 of Indian Penal Code) of the daughter-in-law of their landlord. The duo, along with Swarupchand's other son, was also booked for assaulting their landlord's son and daughter-in-law. 
 
 A magistrate's court in 2011 convicted them, while a sessions court in 2017 upheld the charges of   and sentenced them to two months imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10,000 each. The high court acquitted them of the offence of section 354, but held them guilty of the assault charges. They were sentenced to jail terms for the time they had already served.
 
 "Unless (intention) is proven, merely twisting the hand, causing fall of a woman or catching hold of a corner of her saree during a quarrel cannot be called a deliberate act of outraging the modesty of a female within the meaning of section 354 of the Indian Penal Code," said the judge.
