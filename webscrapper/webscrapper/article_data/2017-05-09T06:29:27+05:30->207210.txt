GORAKHPUR: IPS officers nationwide on Monday came out in support of Charu Nigam, an IPS officer who was allegedly heckled by   BJP MLA   during a protest on Sunday. While the IPS fraternity in UP began deliberations on its social media groups,   wrote an emotional post on Facebook. 

  On Sunday, a group of women protesting against liquor shops in Gorakhpur blocked a road. When Nigam reached there to get the blockade lifted, they began hurling stones at her. She reportedly then order-ed a lathicharge. 
 
  Agarwal, too, reached the spot and had a heated argument with Nigam, who was seen wiping her tears after the incident. She posted a note on Facebook a day later: " Mere ansuon ko meri kamzori na samajh lena ( 't take my tears for weakness). Not out of harshness, but the eyes welled up of tenderness (sic!)." 
 
  Thanking the media for its support, she said in another post: " Mahila adhikari hoon, tumhara gurur na dekh payega. Sachchai mein hai zor itna apna rang dikhlayega (I am a woman officer; your arrogance will not see that. The power of truth will show its colour soon)." 
 
 Nigam told reporters on Monday: "Police were doing their work. The   came and started yelling..." ThaSnior IPS officers met UP chief secretary aon monday evening to demand strict action against the MLA. 
 
 Several women IPS officers also backed Charu. They will appeal to the Yogi government to send out a strong message to politicians who exceed their brief while dealing with administrative officials.
