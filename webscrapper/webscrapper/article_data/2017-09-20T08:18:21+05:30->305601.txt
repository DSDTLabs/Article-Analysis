NEW DELHI: The BCCI's apathy towards the   ­ once a premier domestic tournament and the hunting ground of country's top talent ­ has encouraged a few top Karnataka cricketers like Karun Nair and Krishnappa Gowtham to skip the ongoing tournament in favour of the   ( ).

 Sources in the board said Gowtham left his India Red team in Lucknow on the pretext of being unwell before his match against India Green ended. He then went ahead and played a game for his KPL side Belagavi Panthers. This has upset the board.
 
 “I did play a KPL game after the Duleep Trophy match. But I am an unwell now,” Gowtham said but did not explain why he left the Duleep camp in a rush.
 
 Nair, however, took the board's permission to skip the Duleep Trophy to play the KPL matches for his team Mysuru Warriors. On Tuesday, when India Green were playing India Blue, Nair was playing the KPL match.
 
 The Karnataka Cricket Association spokesperson couldn't give a suitable reply to TOI's query as to why the top state cricketers aren't playing in the Duleep Trophy and instead taking part in KPL. India Red representative and selection committee sources did admit that something was not right about the way Duleep Trophy was being conducted but refused to say anything on record.
 
 TOI was the first to report on how BCCI wasn't interested in conducting the Duleep Trophy this season and had left it out of the schedule initially. Board's technical committee's chairman Sourav Ganguly then made the right noises to bring the tournament back to the BCCI calendar.
