KOCHI: The   has quashed a case falsely foisted upon a   for   in considering an application he filed at a  . 

 A single bench of the court was considering a case where the farmer was alleged to have trespassed into a government office and prevented a government official from discharging duty while being drunk. A medical report had proved that the farmer was in fact not drunk at that time. The farmer, Jaidas Francis of Varayidam in Thrissur, was booked by Thrissur town west police in 2015 on a complaint filed by Rama K Nair, who was the assistant agricultural director in Thrissur. An application filed by the farmer seeking consent for an electricity connection meant for a pump house was allegedly kept pending at the office.
 
 On January 28, 2015, the farmer went to the agricultural office to enquire about the application. Aggrieved by the delay in granting a sanction, the farmer laid himself down on the floor. In the police complaint, the official had alleged that the farmer was drunk.
 
 Questioning the case at the high court, the farmer contended that a false case was registered against him when he protested against the delay. He cannot be said to have trespassed in to the government office as he had gone there to inquire about his application. There is no allegation that he assaulted or used criminal force upon any person at the office. The allegation that he was drunk is proven false by the medical examination report, he argued.
 
 In the judgment that quashed the case against the farmer, the high court said his entry into the public office to enquire about the status of his application cannot be said to be criminal trespass.
 
 "There is not even a whisper in the medical certificate that the petitioner was under the influence of alcohol. Thus it appears that the contention of the petitioner that a case was registered to stifle his rights as a citizen cannot be ignored," the judgment stated.
