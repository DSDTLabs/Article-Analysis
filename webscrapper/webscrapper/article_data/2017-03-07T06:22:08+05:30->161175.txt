MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Monday asked the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) to verify the BMC claims that it was complying with anti-pollution norms at the Kanjurmarg dumping ground. 

 Following a direction by the high court to the BMC to place on record the measures it has undertaken to protect the public's interests, the corporation claimed that Kanjurmarg facility is functioning within parameters. It claimed that the high respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) in the area cannot be solely attributed to the Kanjurmarg site and said that ambient air quality parameters are within prescribed limits.
 
 The court was hearing petitions filed by Kannamwar housing society association and   about the alleged violation of pollution norms at the dumping ground. Advocates Madhav Jamdar and Abhijit Rane, counsel for the association, had raised the issue of pollution and odour emanating from the site. 
 
 In an affidavit placed before the court, the BMC said that the Kanjurmarg dumping ground was the only scientific municipal solid waste processing facility in Mumbai and processes around 3,000 tonnes of waste per day. It is the first project in India using the 'bioreactor landfill' technology, the corporation said. Precautions are being taken to avoid contamination of leachate to the soil or ground water by laying various liners like geo-clay liner, high-density polyethylene and geo-textile on the bottom layer of compacted soil, the agency said. While the landfill gas is being extracted and flared to reduce odour, the BMC pointed out that it was conducting a trial run of using the landfill gas to generate electricity is being conducted that is used for the consumption of the plant. The BMC said that it also set up a control room to respond to complaints. BMC's own   laboratory monitors air quality and other labs were appointed to check other aspects.
