INDORE:   manufacturers of Indore region are losing on market and competition owing to higher cost of production. 

 The   levied by state government on purchase of raw pulses from other states is putting local manufacturers out of the competition.   has urged government to roll back the tax to promote regional dal mill sector. 
 
 MP Dal Mill Association (Indore) president Suresh Agrawal said, “We are losing business because dal processed in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and other states are much economical. They do not levy mandi tax on out station purchase of raw pulses.”
 
 Agarwal said that dal mills have to pay Rs 11,000 as mandi tax on a truckload of 100 quintals pulses. 
 
 Locally manufactured pulses are expensive by Rs 2 to Rs 3 per quintal in comparison to dal produced in other states. 
 
 Dal mills of Indore bring chickpeas, green gram, black gram and red gram from neighbouring states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Dal processors said processed pulses from other states have captured the local market. 
 
 Agrawal said, “We have given a memorandum to chief minister to abolish the mandi tax on purchase of raw pulses from other states.”
 
 According to MP Dal Mill Association, local dal mills have cut down production of processed pulses by about 50 per cent since the operative cost was huge as against the input. 
 
 Dal mills purchase raw pulses from market and then process it into dal of various grades. After processing 60 per cent comes out as dal, while 25 per cent goes as cattle feed and the rest is wasted, experts said. 
 
 There are 175 dal mills in Indore while the state is the leading producer of pulses in the country with a share of 35-40 per cent.
