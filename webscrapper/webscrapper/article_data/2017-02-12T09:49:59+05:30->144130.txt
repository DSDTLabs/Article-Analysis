NAGPUR: After a delay of more than a year, the state government’s four-member committee headed by   (MTSU) director BC Khatua visited the city on Saturday to review taxi and autorickshaw fare hikes in the past three years.

 Representatives of autorickshaw/taxi unions, Grahak Panchayat Sanghatana and other organizations were present during the meeting at Bachat Bhavan in Civil Lines.
 
 Auto unions submitted suggestions regarding fares and demanded a hike. Consumer representatives complained about reluctance of auto drivers to ply by meter. They also complained about the inconvenience being caused to the citizens at   because of high-handedness of auto drivers. The consumer representatives informed the committee that currently auto unions don’t allow App-based taxi providers to pick up passengers from the station.
 
 They also raised objections about taxi aggregators.
 
 Deputy transport commissioner (inspection) JB Patil, deputy RTO (Mumbai)  , deputy RTO (transport commissionerate) Sanjay Sasane, DCP (traffic) Smartna Patil, RS Bhuyar, who is holding additional charge of RTO city, and others were present.
 
 Advocate Girish Godbole, former transport commissioner DG Jadhav and chartered accountant Nitin Doshi are other members of the committee. The committee will submit its report on the hikes carried out as per the Hakim panel formula to the government after completing reviews of all RTOs in the state.
 
 Lakhs of commuters may get relief if the committee suggests lowering of fares and the government accepts the proposal.
 
 Transport minister Diwakar Raote had announced the formation of a fare review committee, to be chaired by a retired high court judge, in May 2015. The transport department decided to form a new committee headed by retired IAS official, as retired high court judges weren’t keen on heading it.
