KANPUR:   Seema Yadav filed her nomination at collectorate in Mati in   on Wednesday. 

 Seema, whose name was synonymous with terror in 1999 until she surrendered in 2006, is contesting from Sikandara assembly seat of Kanpur Dehat as a candidate of Nirdhan Samaj Party of India (NSPI). She is one among the several candidates who are in the fray for the four assembly seats of Kanpur Dehat district which will go to polls on February 19. This seat was won by   of   in 2012 assembly elections.
 
 Clad in a khadi attire and a blue colour party's khadi cap, she reached the collectorate escorted by her supporters and a lawyer.
 
 While talking to TOI, Seema vowed to fight for the cause of women and the poor. "Pahle maine bahut zulm saha tha, phir uske khilaf awaz uthai thi. Ab dobara, phir wohi sab nahi dekhna chahti (First, I was subjected to torture and then I raised my voice against it. Now, I don't want to see such things happening again)," she said angrily.
 
 â€œChandan Singh, a dacoit had kidnapped me and pushed me into hell. Now Seema will fight for the women's rights," she thundered after filing her nomination.
 
 The ex-bandit further said the existing system is not doing much to protect women's rights. "Police need to be more proactive. More needs to be done to deal with sex related offences in the country, and there is a need for harsher punishment for offences against women", she said and added this issue should be taken seriously.
 
 At the time of her surrender in 2006, Seema had nearly 36 criminal cases registered against her. She has been acquitted in many cases. She was finally released from jail in May 2014.
 
 Seema had also carried a cash reward of Rs 55,000 on her arrest.
