PATNA: Engineering aspirants who appeared for the JEE-Advanced on Sunday found the mathematics paper tough. Altogether 5,600 candidates attempted the first-ever computer-based exam conducted by the   ( ) at 21 examination centres in the city.

 Anshu Kumar, one of the candidates, said the papers were tougher than the previous year. “In mathematics, the questions were mainly integer-type and it took a lot of time to solve them. Physics and chemistry sections were moderate. I focused on physics and chemistry sections and attempted few questions from mathematics as well. The idea was to avoid negative marking,” Anshu said.
 
 The examinees wrote two papers in two shifts – Paper I (9am to 12noon) and Paper II (2pm to 5pm). Each paper had 54 questions, including physics, chemistry and mathematics. The two papers carried 360 marks.
 
 “I found Paper I easier than Paper II as it was very complicated and required lengthy calculations. Physics part was easy, but chemistry and mathematics sections were tough. Three hours were not enough to answer the questions,” said Adnan Shahid, who wrote the papers at a Punaichak centre.
 
 Super 30 founder and mathematician   said the paper was moderate. “In Paper II, the mathematics section was complicated because of coordinate geometry section,” he added.
 
 Former DGP and founder of   30 Abhayanand said students who tirelessly practised for two years would easily crack the exam, while others may find it difficult. “The level of question was good,” he said.
 
 CBSE regional officer Jagdish Burman said no untoward incident occurred at any examination centre in the city.
 
 Those qualifying the exam will be eligible for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) across the country. The results are likely to be announced on June 10.
