NEW DELHI: On today's date 37 years ago, the   - which has become "the world largest party" - was founded with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the helm as party president.

 Today, the BJP, which was elected to power at the centre in 2014, is in power (including in four with allies) in 17 states. Since 1980, it's built up its primary membership to 12 million, the BJP says. 
 
 Aside from Vajpayee and Shah, the party's presidents have been LK Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi,   and Venkaiah Naidu.
 
  
  
 On its website, the BJP calls itself "the most prominent member of the family of organisations known as the 'Sangh Parivar' and nurtured by the   (RSS)". 
 
 The BJP emerged from Jana Sangh, which was formed in 1951 by Shyama Prasad Mookerjee. The Jana Sangh merged with some other parties to form the Janata Party in 1977, after the Emergency imposed by then   Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
 
 The Janata Party dissolved in 1980 and its members formed the BJP with Vajpayee as its first president.
