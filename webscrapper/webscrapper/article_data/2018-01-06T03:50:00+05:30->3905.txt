Panaji: Two species of   — the long-billed vulture and the white-romped vulture — spotted in the state in the past, have reportedly not been seen for the last three years. 

 “I haven’t seen a single vulture in Goa for three years now,” said principal chief conservator of forests, Ajay Saxena.
 
 Goa used to be a breeding site for the two species of vultures. Karnataka and Maharashtra are trying to protect them and their breeding sites. 
 
 The scavenging bird of prey is being bred and released into the wild in other states and the Goa’s forest department might consider this in future, Saxena said.
 
 The reason for their decline in the country was found to be the drug Diclofenac administered to cattle that the vultures fed on after they died. Although the drug is now banned, other medicines, pollution, pesticides and lack of carcasses to feed on are affecting the vulture population. 
 
 Bombay Natural History Society scientist Dr Vibhu Prakash will deliver a key note address on the conservation of vultures on January 12 at the Cotigao Wildlife Sanctuary. 
 
 Bird hunting is not common in the state. Compared to states like Arunachal Pradesh, where they tend to fly away no sooner they see a human lift a pair of binoculars, birds in Goa continue to throng the state’s wetlands without fear, Saxena said. Goa’s bird watching conservation network and other birders, who frequent these sites, also act as a deterrent for anyone looking to harm them, he added.
