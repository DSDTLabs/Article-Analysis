Former national champions  , Dehradun stamped their superiority over hosts   Union as they raced to a 25-19, 25-19, 25-20 straight-set victory to emerge champions in the All-India   tournament at Cuncolim court on Saturday.
 
  The final – played in front of a packed venue -- was a repeat of the opening day’s play when ONGC needed a tough five-setter to see off the hosts, who had imported all players from  , particularly from the Sports Authority of India (SAI) regional training centre. In the final, however, ONGC proved too hot to handle for their inexperienced rivals.
  
  Centre blockers Subba Rao and Navjit Singh were at their best as they negated Cuncolim’s attackers, particularly the dangerous   who didn’t know what to do when the centre blockers timed their jump to perfection. Rohit’s back-court smashing too left a lot to be desired, with his serves being the only saving grace.
  
  Worse for Cuncolim, Sohan Singh too was off-colour and had to be benched for the third set. He was replaced by captain Omvir Mann, but the man who has represented the country was never going to start firing straightway after warming the bench for the entire tournament. He tried but lacked power and precision.
  
  For ONGC, Vinit Kumar got most of the points. Whether in front of the net, or from beyond the three-metre mark, Vinit was unstoppable and was helped by players like Raman Singh and Remant Chauhan. Subba Rao and Navjit’s crucial finishing during rallies only added to their advantage.
  
  ONGC attacker Vinit Kumar was voted the best smasher of the final while Navjit Singh walked with the Man-of-the-Match award. Punjab Police captain Gurinder Singh was declared the best player of the tournament.
