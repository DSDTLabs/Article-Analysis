* Welcome delegates with a smile

 * Always be polite even at the face of queries Address senior delegates as “Sir”
 
 * Interact with delegates in English
 
 * Dress perfectly
 
 These are some of the guidelines handed over to the 200-odd police personnel who would be in the “inner circle” of the fourth edition of Bengal   Summit on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Biswa Bangla Convention Centre in New Town.
 
 The cops who would be on duty at the business summit this year underwent a course in soft skills in the last two weeks and on Sunday, they took part in a mock drill at the convention centre to test their newly learnt skills. “There will be a host of VVIP delegates from the country as well as across the globe. As this is the most prestigious event for our city, we’ve trained our officers with soft skills to ensure the delegates feel comfortable with the men in uniform around,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.
 
 The officer added, while the officers who can communicate in proper English have been kept within the closed ring of the summit, others have been put on duty outside. “We also have help desks and a few personnel with foreign language skills who will work as translators and liaison officers,” he said.
 
 According to the officer, some of these men were trained in soft skills, crisis management and how to interact with foreign delegates by the FIFA officials before the Under-17 World Cup last year. “Officers with pre-set skills imparted the knowledge to others,” the officer said.
 
 The two-day summit will host around 4,000 delegates from India and abroad. A source in the state government said there will be participation from 30 countries, with eight partner countries — Germany, Italy, France, Poland, United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and Czech Republic. “The delegation from China will be the biggest ever from two manufacturing states,” an official said.
 
 The state government source said, going by the attendance from the corporate world at the summit, the names which are doing the rounds include —  , Adi  ,  , Gautam Adani, Sunil Munjal, Sajjan Jindal and L N Mittal. Mittal and Ambani have verbally assured chief minister Mamata Banerjee they would attend BGBS.
