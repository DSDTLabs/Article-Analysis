LUCKNOW: The special   court in Lucknow, which had started day-to-day hearing in the   demolition case last week, said on Wednesday that it would frame charges against former deputy PM LK   and 11 other   and RSS leaders on May 25 and 26 for their alleged role in conspiracy behind the razing of the structure on December 6, 1992. 

 While charges against Advani, Murli  , Uma Bharati, Viany Katiyar, Sadhvi Ritambhara and Vishnu Hari Dalmiya would be framed on May 26, Mahant Nritya Gopal Das, Mahant Ram Vilas Vedanti, Baikunth Lal Sharma alias Prem Ji, Champat Rai Bansal, Dharma das and Dr Satish Pradhan would be charged a day before. 
 
 All of them have been asked to be present in the court when charges would be framed against them. While the CBI court had dropped conspiracy charged against the leaders in 2001, the Allahabad HC had upheld the order in 2010. The CBI, however, moved the SC which in its April 19, 2017 order, asked the CBI court to add conspiracy charges against the accused in the trial. Two FIRs were lodged in the case. Second FIR named Advani, Joshi and 13 others for inciting the mob through their speeches.
