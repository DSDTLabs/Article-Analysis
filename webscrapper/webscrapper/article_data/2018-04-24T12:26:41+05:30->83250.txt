CHANDIGARH: The foul smell of cow dung that the cattle-pound staff dumps in Industrial area   has become a serious issue for the people who have factories nearby.

 The manufacturers who shared their problem with TOI said a lot of dung from the cattle pound in Phase I ended up in a vacant land near their factories. This waste has built up into heaps and become a breeding ground for mosquitoes, causing threat of a vector-borne epidemic for the local workers.
 
 The problem is severe particularly in front of industrial plots 701 to 709, which are in a lane facing the Industrial Area cattle pound. “Ever since I set up my unit in 2003, they have been disposing of cow dung in front of my factory. Last year, two of my workers were diagnosed with dengue fever because of this unhygienic environment. We informed the municipal corporation (MC) and the health department, but they took no action,” says local manufacturer Hemant Bhambri.
 
 “The cattle pound workers dump animal waste near our workplace without any consideration of our health,” said another factory owner,  . “Earlier, they used to dispose of this the waste on the other side of the pound. Upon the intervention of former mayor Asha Jaswal, they stopped using that space but now they have started spoiling our surroundings.” Manufacturer Sudershan Hooda said: “My workers cannot do their job without applying mosquito repellant. They also have to suffer that unbearable stench of cow dung. If the municipal corporation can penalise residents if they leave water to stagnate in coolers, why can’t it manage the waste of its own cattle pound?”
 
 Owners of factory units in Industrial Area Phase 1 have been demanding the conversion of open areas to either parks or parking lots due to increased use of these spaces for the dumping of waste. Area councillor Shakti Parkash Devshali said he had proposed a green belt over this vacant land to resolve the issue permanently but the house was yet to consider his idea.”
