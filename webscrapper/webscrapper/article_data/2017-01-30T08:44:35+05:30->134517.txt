PATNA: The number of vehicles in the city has increased manifold in the last 10 years, but the state police headquarters has failed to meet the requirements of traffic police personnel resulting in vehicular chaos on the roads in the state capital. The situation has not improved despite spending around Rs 24 crore on installing advanced traffic light system on different intersections in the city.

 According to the official records,   traffic police has the strength of 798 personnel against the sanctioned strength of 1,229. It means 431 posts are lying vacant. Moreover, out of the 798 personnel, 205 are on deputation from the other districts police and the BMP-11. 
 
 When asked, Patna traffic SP Prantosh Kumar Das said the sanctioned strength of the city’s traffic police is the same as it was in the year 2005. “The number of vehicles on the Patna roads has increased threefold in the last decade. Acute lack of manpower hampers proper traffic management,” he said, adding that the count of vehicles in the city has increased from around 5 lakh in 2005 to around 12.5 lakh at present.
 
 “We need at least 3,000 police personnel to regulate traffic in Patna, else the situation will deteriorate fast in future,” a senior police officer of Patna traffic police said on the condition of anonymity.
 
 Patna district transport officer (DTO) Ajay Kumar Thakur, when contacted, said at least 6,000 vehicles hit the roads in the state capital every month.
 
 According to the data available with the district traffic police, 7.29 lakh two-wheelers, 10,604 trailers, 4,878 medium goods vehicles, 1.61 lakh cars, 23,005 delivery vans, 2,225 taxis, 2,163 moped, 33,611 heavy goods vehicles, 3,249 mini buses, 239 ambulances, 22,643 jeeps and gypsys, 52,625 passenger three-wheelers, 21,409 commercial tractors, 5,162 jeep taxis and 2,269 buses were plying on the Patna roads till six months back. The number has increased further.
