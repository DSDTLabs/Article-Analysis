AGRA: The results of final exams at  , which the administration had said would be announced by June 15, might, like last year, get delayed this year too. Two weeks after the main exams (theory part) ended, the practical exams are yet to be conducted for around 500 self-finance colleges.

 The university had first planned to complete the practical exams before the main exams started. In January, it had said it would conduct practical exams from January 8 to February 7 for undergraduate courses and February 8 to 15 for post-graduate courses. The plan, however, was implemented in only half a dozen colleges out of the 1000 colleges affiliated to the university.
 
 This year, the final exams started on March 7 and ended on April 27. Teachers are busy evaluating answer sheets even as the practical exam process is pending in around 500 colleges. The university’s public relation officer GS Sharma said, “Practical exams are pending in self-financed colleges as a majority of them have either not submitted the exam fee on time or haven’t provided the details sought by the university administration.” 
 
 A B.Sc second year student, who refused to be named, said, “Every year, the university administration delays the declaration of results due to practical exams. Neither the college nor the university authorities has informed anything about the schedule of practical exams. They keep passing the blame on each other while students bear the brunt.”
