HYDERABAD: State health minister Dr C   launched glaucoma awareness campaign on Sunday, saying that the government is coming up with a preventive care against vision loss. 

 "As part of several initiatives taken by the government, the CM has asked for an action plan to be readied for doing eye check-ups across the state. The plan will be ready in three months and people will undergo eye screening and treatment, apart from being provided spectacles," said Dr Manoj Mathur at Centre for Sight super-specialty Hospital, on World Glaucoma Day
 
 Stressing on the need for early detection, experts pointed out that 40% damage is already by the time most glaucoma patients reach out to an ophthalmologist. "We'll be working with the government through anganwadis, 150 vision centres across the state, an ophthalmic centre in each district and tertiary care centre. We will screen the eye health of people through a questionnaire, with the help of anganwadi workers," Mathur added.
 
 Patients will be referred to vision centres or an ophthalmologist at district level for tertiary care. "According to statistics 1% population has vision impairment and estimated prevalence of glaucoma is 3.5%. Upto 90% of glaucoma patients go undetected. We at   (HOA) are offering our services to the government. HOA and TOS will also conduct CMEs for doctors on 'how not to miss glaucoma," Mathur further said.
 
 To spread awareness about the disorder and its prevalence among children, a 'Glaucoma Awareness Walk' was flagged off at LV Prasad Eye Institute on Sunday during   (March 11-17).
