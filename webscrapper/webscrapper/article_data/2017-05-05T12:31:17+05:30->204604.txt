Everyone is enjoying at Adi and Aaliya's sangeet ceremony. Shagun is irritated by Ishita as she hears the guests are not liking the arrangements.
 
  Roshni, on the other hand, is worried as Gagan can send his guy with Adi and Roshni's wedding pictures anytime. Romi is also keeping an eye on Roshni.
  
  Madhavi is waiting for her Guruji, who she specially invited to give blessings to Adi and Aaliya. Madhavi gets to know that Guruji's car is due to wrongly parked cars.
  
  
 
  
  Bala announces the car number and asks people to make way for guruji. One of Shagun's guests is adamant and refuses to move his car. Guruji gets upset and leaves.
  
  Shagun takes her friend's side and irks Madhavi. Raman gets angry. Just then, Roshni comes with guruji and everyone is happy. She manages to stop him.
  
  Roshni then smartly takes Gagan's friend away and asks him to give her the pictures. She then threatens him that she will start shouting and get him arrested for gatecrashing. He gets scared and hands over the pictures to her.
