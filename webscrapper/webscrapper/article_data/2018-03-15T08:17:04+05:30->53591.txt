 Speaking to TOI over phone following the arrest of Hindutva leader Milind Ekbote, Ambedkar said, “Both, Ekbote and Bhide are the main conspirators behind the violence. Ideally, they should have been arrested earlier. We had to follow up the case with the government which finally resulted in the arrest of one conspirator. Now, we expect the government to arrest Bhide as well.”
 
 
  
 Ambedkar said, “We will pursue Bhide’s case with the government. The two leaders not only terrorised people but also created a rift in society which is unacceptable in the current socio-political scenario. If required, we will take our protests to the streets till Bhide is arrested.”

 Vadhu Budruk resident Rajendra Gaikwad said, “The situation in the village is normal today. We preferred not to vitiate the atmosphere by going for needless celebration over today’s development. Bhide too should be arrested at t he earliest.”
 
 The village’s former sarpanch Praful Shivle said, “We are of the opinion that all the conspirators should be arrested and punished. Over the last few weeks, members of Dalit and Maratha communities have jointly participated in several social programmes.”
 
 Some villagers demanded compensation for those who lost their businesses and property in the violence.
