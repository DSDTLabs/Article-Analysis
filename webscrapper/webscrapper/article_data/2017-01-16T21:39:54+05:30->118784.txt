Actor   is the latest to speak up against the recent   event that happened in Bengaluru on  . The ���mass molestation��� incident that happened in Bengaluru has been the talk of the country. 

 The actor posted a series of tweets on his micro-blogging page. ���Who is going to protect women in India from us? We are among the worst, most disgusting men on the planet. I am so ashamed. I'm so sorry. A woman should wear what she wants to wear. Anyone who connects that to abuse needs to stop now! Stop lecturing women on their choices. Nothing justifies molestation, abuse and rape. Nothing! No exceptions. Anyone who forgets this needs to be corrected. Speak out. Act. Change. Just because you can see something, doesn't give you the right to have it. Change your VIEW! Stop trying to change what's on display."
