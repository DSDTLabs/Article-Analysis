COIMBATORE: More than 50 Village Administrative Officers (VAOs) from Coimbatore district staged a sit-in-protest at the   office campus on Monday night, demanding the state government to fulfill their demands. They said that they would leave the protest place on Tuesday around 6 am.

 Tamil Nadu VAOs association, district secretary   said that the state government though has provided laptops to each VAO for issuing online certificates like revenue and community certifies, haven’t given them internet connection. “Each VAO is forced to pay Rs 2,000 for internet connection to issue online certificates. The state government doesn’t refund the amount. We requested the government to provide money for using the internet, however no action is taken yet,” said Saravanan.
 
 He further said that sometimes VAOs had to take care of additional two more villages. But, they are not paid for doing the extra work. 
 
 “Many of our VAOs demanded the government to conduct counselling for transfers. Even that fell on deaf ears. These intensified our protest. We stopped issuing online certificates from December 14, 2017. We know that our protest would affect the people, but we don’t know any other way to get justice from the government,” he added.
 
 The members of   plan to besiege the collectorate on Wednesday. They also decided not to supply pongal gifts including the free dhoti and sarees to the respective rations shops.
