Nagpur: The appointment of new dean of faculties took another turn on Monday as Nagpur University (NU) registrar Puran Meshram decided to hold back the announcement for some more time.

 Following implementation of the new direction for reorganization of faculties, NU needs to appoint a new dean for the faculty of interdisciplinary studies as the incumbent Rajendra Kakde belongs to the department of pharmaceutical sciences. In the new grouping, pharmaceutical sciences has been placed under the faculty of science and technology, whose dean is Maheshkumar Yenkie.
 
 On July 17, TOI had quoted vice-chancellor SP Kane as saying that “it is up to the registrar when he issues the notification” and that “everything would be clear by Monday”.
 
 But on Monday, Meshram told TOI, “Right now, all posts of dean are vacant. Appointments are under process. It will take another two to three days to finalize the names.”
 
 Meshram referred to the posts as vacant since the NU had given additional charge to all of them.
 
 At the same time, he confirmed that two new deans would be appointed. “The faculty of interdisciplinary studies as well as science and technology will see new deans,” Meshram said.
 
 As per the new universities Act, four new faculties — humanities and commerce being the other two — were constituted. However, the NU had placed pharmaceutical sciences under interdisciplinary studies which led to resentment among teachers and students. The university relented to the demand only after the intervention of the government, which asked all the universities to have a uniform grouping of faculties.
 
 On Monday, there buzz that Kakde could be named as the dean of science and technology. When contacted, Kakde said he was yet to get any intimation from the administration.
