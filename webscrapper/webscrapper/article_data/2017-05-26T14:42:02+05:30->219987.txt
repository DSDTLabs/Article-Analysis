Bigg Boss 10 finalist   recently got a cupping therapy done and shared the picture of her back with her fans on Instagram.
 
  The popular VJ was recently in the US enjoying her time, doing all that is on her bucket list and living her life to the fullest. It seems that the rejuvenating cupping therapy was also on her list.
  
  
 
  
  She shared a picture on Instagram and wrote, "You look at someone and judge them. Before you even realise you're doing it, before you even realise it's done- it's so innate the programming. People that train, athletes, competitive or not, go through a lot of pain on a daily basis. Some internal, some external. It's like muscle warfare, mental warfare - yes one more rep pick it the fuck up.. And then there's all the stuff life likes to throw at you. The good, the beautiful, the love that gets you so high you just want to bury yourself in it, the bad and then the really really fucked up shit that makes you feel you have absolutely no control and where was that fucking thing we like to call 'the point' in all of this to begin with? So yes, the notorious ever changing 'point'."
