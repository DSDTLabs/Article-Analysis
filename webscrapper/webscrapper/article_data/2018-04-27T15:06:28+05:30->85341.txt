NAGPUR: Director,   and Evaluation (BoEE), Neeraj Khaty has finally placed the documents related to the controversial minutes of Board of Examinations, which had allowed then law student Sunil Mishra to return his  .

 Vice chancellor SP Kane told TOI that he would go through the documents and soon convene an emergent meeting of BoEE to take a decision on the matter.
 
 Taking note of a TOI report dated April 9, the   had written to the BoEE director, asking him to place before him all the important documents related to the surrender of Mishra’s marklist within three days. But, Khaty had sought more time to put up the documents related to the November 13, 2006, BoE meeting.
 
 Since the case involves former top officials, including SN Pathan, Gaurishanker Parasher, Subhash Belsare and ML Nagargoje, there was pressure on the director to delay the case.
 
 NU officials said Kane is likely to show the same promptness in dealing with this case as he had shown in academician Dr Vedprakash Mishra’s diploma cancellation case last month. Moving at a swift pace, the NU administration had taken the decision to withdraw Dr Vedprakash’s diploma in Gandhian Thoughts in just three BoEE meetings, once the period of waiting for his reply ended.
 
 The case had been pending for over three decades, and none of the VCs in these years had touched the sensitive issue. Sources said, “The VC would be showing equal zeal in this case too since Sunil Mishra has been making personal attacks on him of late.”
 
 However, Kane has been non-committal on the action to be taken, and fixing responsibility on former VC SN Pathan, ex-ProVC Gaurishanker Parasher, ex-registrar Subhash Belsare, ex-CoE ML Nagargoje, and eight BoE members, who passed the resolution to accept Sunil Mishra's bogus LLB marklists in 2006.
