RAJKOT: In the past two days, police have quizzed more than 1,000 suspects to solve the rape case of a four-year-old girl. Police have formed 12 teams for speedy investigation of the case. 

 The teams are led by Dwarka police station inspector P A  ,   local crime branch (LCB), Devbhoomi Dwarka special operation group (SOG),   LCB, Jamnagar SOG, Rajkot rapid response cell and one led by Mahila police sub-inspector. 
 
 Police have also conducted medical examination of 20 suspects in the case.
 
 “All the teams have been entrusted with different tasks. For example, one team will question labourers, while another one will take their statements. One of the teams will check   footages near the crime spot, while one team will be engaged in mobile surveillance,” said P A Dekivadia. 
 
 The minor girl was raped in Kuranga village, 32km from temple town Dwarka on Monday. The rape survivor’s mother lodged a complaint in which she said that her daughter was raped by an unidentified person at the labour colony of RSPL’s upcoming soda ash plant in Kuranga. 
 
 The girl was rushed to Jamnagar’s state-run GG Hospital for medical check-up and treatment. The survivor’s family had come from Chhattisgarh to work as labourers, said police.
 
 “When the four-year-old girl’s mother returned from the washroom she saw a person running away while her daughter was bleeding from her private parts. The woman got scared and started screaming. Soon, people and security personnel gathered there,” said Dekivadia. 
 
 The family members alleged that though the girl was sexually assaulted in the morning police didn’t lodge an FIR till late evening, which allowed the perpetrator of the crime to escape.
 
 The state women’s commission has sought a detailed report from the district superintendent of police in the Dwarka rape case.
