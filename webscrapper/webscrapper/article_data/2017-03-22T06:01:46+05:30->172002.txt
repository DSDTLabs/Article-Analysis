NEW DELHI:   were not too enthused with the Supreme Court’s suggestion for talks to resolve the  , saying past attempts had eluded consensus. 

 All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) member Kamal Faruqui told TOI, “The Supreme Court has said this today and the board will take it up for consideration in its executive committee. A dialogue is a good idea and there should be discussion.” 
 
 However, he said only the court could give a solution as past attempts at out of court settlement did not yield any result. Faruqui added that a dialogue was possible only if it was not about who won or lost.
 
 Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind president Maulana Arshad Madani told TOI that while he had full faith in the SC, he was not hopeful of any positive outcome from a dialogue between rival parties. “In the past too, such dialogues happened but no solution came out. I don’t think anything different will happen this time,” he said.
 
 “Ultimately, the solution will come from the Supreme Court and we will accept whatever the court decides,” Madani added.
 
 Babri Masjid Action Committee, which is a party to the case, had a similar opinion. “We are fine with the Chief Justice of India mediating... we trust him. We are also ready if he nominates a team to hear the matter. But out of court settlement is not possible. If SC passes an order in this regard, we will look into it,” said Zafaryab Jilani, convenor of the committee.
 
 Jilani said going by his experience of the last three decades, the matter could not be settled outside the court. “Let them hear us, we are prepared. But we are not ready for out of court settlement,” Jilani said.
 
 Syed Mohammad Ashraf, founder of   (AIUMB) said he saw the SC’s suggestion as an opportunity that should be explored. “We have always wanted an amicable solution to the dispute. All parties must sit together and work towards a consensus,” Ashraf said.
