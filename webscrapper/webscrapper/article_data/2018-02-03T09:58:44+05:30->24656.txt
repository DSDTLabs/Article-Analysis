LUDHIANA: A fully automated laundry machine was inaugurated by chairman Mrs. Bector Food Specialities Ltd   at Ludhiana civil hospital on Friday.

 The laundry machine, donated by the company Mrs. Bector Food Specialities Ltd, can wash and dry 70-100 sheets in one go. This laundry machine would benefit the poor in the long run by supplying properly washed and dried linen, blankets, and OT sheets to the hospital.
 
 “After working for various initiatives in civil hospital since 2013, we felt that the bedsheets remain dirty and are always insufficient. We donated 800 sheets, but, the problem could not be solved. We realised that the main cause of the problem was that the sheets were not cleaned, and the hospital needed an in-house  . So, we approached Rajni Bector and she undertook the whole project of financing, setting up and having the unit installed on her own. This was a task of immense social responsibility, which involved high cost, time and efforts and hence, needs to be acknowledged. We are really very thankful to her,” said the members of Ludhiana Cares Ladies Society.
 
 Ludhiana deputy commissioner   and civil surgeon of the hospital   were also present at the occasion.
