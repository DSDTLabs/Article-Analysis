PANAJI: The Goa Police has received an   for its smart policing initiative, the   Sentinel scheme, from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), New Delhi. The scheme, which was introduced on November 10 last year, rewards citizens handsomely for reporting traffic violations.

 Director general of police Muktesh Chander, on Wednesday received the special jury award at an event in New Delhi from Union minister Vijay Goel.
 
 Under the Traffic Sentinel scheme, any citizen in Goa can send photos and videos of violations along with details of the erring vehicle to 7875756110. After collecting a certain number of points, citizens are eligible for a cash reward. Till date, 40 traffic sentinels have been rewarded Rs 3.4 lakh. 
 
 “We are also in the process of disbursing an amount of Rs 8.6 lakh for another 39 sentinels,” Chander said. 
 
 The Traffic Sentinel scheme is easy to enroll for and keeps the complainant’s identity confidential.
 
 The traffic cell of the Goa Police receives an average of 1,000 complaints of traffic violations per day from around 1,500 citizen sentinels linked to its WhatsApp platform under the scheme. The cell sometimes receives 300 cases of violations from a single sentinel.
 
 Violators are then issued notices under the Motor Vehicle Act and asked to settle charges at the traffic cell.
 
 Based on the type of violation, the user is entitled to certain points. For instance, reporting a violation of triple-seat riding on a two-wheeler will earn them 10 points, while parking on footpaths or zebra crossings will accrue three points.
 
 On accumulating 100 points, the user can claim a reward of Rs 1,000. A lucky draw will also be held, wherein a sentinel may win either a motorcycle or a car.
