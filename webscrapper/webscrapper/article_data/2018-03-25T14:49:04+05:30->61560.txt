Mumbai: A game that began with a bang ended in whimper for India’s women’s team as they lost to England in their second tri-series outing at the   on Sunday afternoon. The visitors needed to do something really special in order to bring about the highest chase ever in women’s T20 cricket, and they managed precisely that, chasing down a challenging 199 for the loss of only three wickets.

 
 
 Opener   did the star turn for the victors hammering a rapid-fire 124 in only 64 balls and was well supported by   (35 runs), who came in at the fall of the other opener Bryony Smith. This was Wyatt’s top score and her second ton in T20 cricket, and the seventh overall in this format of the women’s game.
 
 The 26-year-old’s knock not only put to shade magnificent efforts by Indian openers   (76 runs, 12x4, 2x6) and   (53 runs, 7x4), but also made England’s passage into the final of the tournament a near certainty. India, on the other hand, have lost both their opening games and will find it extremely difficult to stay alive for a place in the summit clash with two games remaining.
 
 Faced with a daunting target, England made their intentions clear from the very beginning and never let their feet off the pedal. Wyatt, especially, looked murderous and left every bowler she faced scratching their heads. She rarely missed out on scoring opportunities and her knock contained 15 boundaries and five sixes.
 
 Wyatt struck three boundaries in the very first over off the experienced Jhulan Goswami and set the tempo for the remainder of the innings. In the ninth over, she struck spinner Poonam Yadav for a couple of sixes and had raced to 82 off only 40 balls at the end of the 10th over, with her team placed comfortably at 107/1. Thereafter, it was only a matter of not attempting anything silly and the Englishwomen stuck to their task to near perfection. Four of India’s six bowlers ended up with economy rates above 10 with spinner Anuja Patil proving to be the most expensive. She gave away 40 runs in three overs.
 
 Earlier, India did well to put up a total of 198/4 in their 20 overs. Mandhana and Raj put on 129 before Mandhana fell for 76 on the fifth ball of the 13th over to medium pacer Natalie Sciver, who had her caught by Beaumont at point. This was Mandhana’s second successive half-century, after the 67 she hit against Australia. Raj was out a couple of overs later to Natasha Farrant for 53. She failed to beat Jenny Gunn at long on and was caught.
 
 Gunn, meanwhile, could not do much in her 100th T20 outing and ended up conceding 49 wicketless runs in her four overs.
 
 Brief scores: India 198/4 in 20 overs (Smriti Mandhana 76, Mithali Raj 53, Harmanpreet Kaur 30, Pooja Vastrakar 22; Natasha Farrant 2/32) lost to England 199/3 in 18.4 overs (Danielle Wyatt 124, Tamsin Beaumont 35, Deepti Sharma 2/36) by seven wickets.
