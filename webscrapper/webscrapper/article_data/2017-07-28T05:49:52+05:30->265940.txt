NEW DELHI: After forming an alliance government in Bihar, BJP has shifted its focus to another eastern state   as a party delegation called on the   seeking disqualification of chief minister   citing anomalies in his affidavit in 2014 state assembly polls.

 Headed by party spokesperson  , the delegation complained to the   that Naveen Patnaik had lied under oath, while submitting his election affidavit in the year 2014, when he contested from Hinjli constituency in the Ganjam district of Odisha.
 
 As per the party memorandum, Patnaik had stated in the affidavit that he had received an amount of Rs 13,10,625 through   (cheque) bearing No.538976288 on 2nd April, 2014 from his party i.e. BJD towards election expenditure.
 
 The BJD, of which Patnaik is also the president had filed the statement of election expenditure on 28 July, 2014 through the party treasurer Lalbihari. In this statement of expenditure it is shown that the party had paid Patnaik on two occasions through cheques (Numbered 441619 and 795036) and not RTGS.The first cheque was worth 10 lakh rupees and the second cheque worth Rs 6,48,320.Both these total to Rs.16,48,320 and not Rs.13 lakh as claimed by Patnaik.
 
 BJP has alleged that Patnaik has misrepresented facts on two counts.
 
 "Moreover it's astonishing to find that the RTGS number claimed by Naveen Patnaik is also the RTGS no.of Mr Ramchandra Hansda, the MP of BJD, who is behind bars because of his involvement in chit fund scam. The question is, was the BJD using the chit fund scam money to contest elections in 2014," the saffron party has questioned.
