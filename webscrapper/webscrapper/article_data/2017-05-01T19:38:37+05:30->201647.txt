NEW DELHI: Riding on the back of a string of launches,   reported a 23 per cent growth in domestic April sales of its passenger vehicles. The company sold 12,827 units in a lineup which now includes Hexa and Tigor – cars launched earlier this year.

 Tata Motors has reported that the positive response to Hexa MUV was maintained in the month of April while its much-awaited sedan – Tigor – has also garnered attention since its launch last month. Tiago – launched last year- continues to lead the way for the company.
 
 “Tata Motors (has) continued its robust sales performance with a growth of 23% in April led by a strong pipeline for Tiago and a positive response for our new lifestyle UV -  ,” said Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicles business unit at   Motors. “We have also successfully completed the launch of Tigor across the country and are delighted that it has been well received by our customers.”
 
 Sales of commercial vehicles though suffered a minor jolt, and the company in a statement said that while the ban on BS III vehicles has taken a toll on figures, wholesale and retail is expected to pick up in May and June.
 
 The company sold 16,017 units in April – down 36 per cent from figures in April of last year. As a result, cumulative sales figures of both passenger and commercial vehicles (including exports) fell from 39,389 units in April of 2016 to 30,972 in the corresponding month of the current year.
