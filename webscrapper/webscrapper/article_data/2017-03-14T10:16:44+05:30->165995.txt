HYDERABAD: Blame it on demonetisation or poor revenues. The state government has discontinued the Rs 4,675 crore Special Development Fund (SDF) introduced in the 2016-17 budget. The 2017-18 budget makes no mention of the fund this year. 

 The government introduced SDF to meet the requirements and contingencies that arise in the course of year which could not be anticipated in advance and which need to be addressed immediately. After announcement of the fund in the last budget, some ministers too asked that some of the money from SDF be made available to them for releases during emergencies. 
 
 Later, the state cabinet approved SDF for both the chief minister and other members of the cabinet. While the CM got 5,000 crore in special funds, each minister was to be given Rs 25 crore each year. 
 
 Official sources said, the government decided to give a quiet burial to the SDF as its corpus will need to go up as the number of districts increased to 31 from the the previous ten. 
 
 Sources said though Rs 5,000 crore was earmarked for SDF, both the chief minister and his cabinet colleagues could not draw on the money in view of the prevailing financial conditions in the state. 
 
 Interestingly, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao announced that 3 crore would be kept at the disposal of each collector to meet the requirements and emergencies expenditure. Though he made this announcement during the recent district collectors' conference, allocations have not been made in the budget. Some ministers and MLAs reportedly told the chief minister that allocation of special budget to collector would give scope for another power centre and people may approach officials instead of them for sanctioning of various works in their areas.
