CHENNAI: The   is like an eagle that does not fear sparrows, said   fisheries minister and AIADMK leader D   on Tuesday, reacting to the rousing speech delivered by actor   at an event in a medical college in Chennai. While addressing students on Monday, Rajinikanth had taken on his detractors, seeming to usurp the MGR legacy and promising an MGR-like rule for the poor. 

 "The eagle that flies high is not afraid of sparrows flying below," he said in a sarcastic reference to Rajinikanth, who said he would fill the void left behind by leaders like former chief ministers M G Ramachandran and J Jayalalithaa. "In the past several people started parties saying they will provide a government like that of MGR. But there is no trace of them now," he said.
 
 The minister also took on Rajinikanth for his advice to students to learn English "for success in any profession". The minister said, "We are asking our children to speak in Tamil. We make them call us 'amma' and 'appa.' But, Rajinikanth is asking students to call their parents, 'mummy' and 'daddy'. He says just by speaking in Tamil, the language will not grow," Jayakumar told reporters here. The minister, however, added there was nothing wrong in learning English. 
 
 Rajinikanth had urged students to speak in English among themselves so that their language skill improves. He said Tamils should move outside the state and the country and grow in their career if they knew English. The actor added that after studying in Tamil medium till Class 12, students find it difficult to cope with their subjects in college as they are in English.
 
 BJP state president   said as a leader Rajinikanth can try to fill the leadership vacuum in Tamil Nadu, but he cannot put down others, saying they are not good. "I differ from his views. Everyone is playing their role properly," she added.
