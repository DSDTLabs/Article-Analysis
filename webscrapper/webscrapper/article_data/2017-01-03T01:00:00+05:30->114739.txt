In 2016, a record number of gurgaonwallahs went off-roading. Last year, the basic   got a really good response, and next year, we are looking forward to making the extreme form also popular. Next week, our group members will be going for off-roading with their families. One problem that we are facing is that we can’t go off-roading in the outskirts due to construction work going on there, so we have to go to cities like Ludhiana and Amritsar.

 
 
 The number off-roading enthusiasts in Gurgaon are increasing, but the lack of open spaces is a problem. however, the situation in gurgaon is still better than other metros. if I drive 5-10Km out of the city, I can hit an off-road trail. I hope in the coming year we have more areas to go off-roading 
 
 
 
 In Gurgaon, off-roading began as a weekend leisure activity, and has now become a lifestyle. The fact that there are dedicated off-roading centres in the city now shows how popular it has become. In 2017, I’d like to see more women drivers take it up 
 
 
 
 Although off-roading has been around for almost a decade, 2016 was a watershed year for Gurgaon. We saw many groups being formed, as well as off-roading events being organised across  . Our group had a 30% rise in membership in 2016. 2017, I feel, will take this trend further. More SUVs are coming in the market and they are quite cheap. I won't be surprised if Gurgaon not only sees more off-roading groups this year but also more dedicated zones and venues for it
