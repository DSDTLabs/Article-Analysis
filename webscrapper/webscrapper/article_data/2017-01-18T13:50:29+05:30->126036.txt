MUMBAI: As preparations are on for the   before   is sworn into office, a choreographer from Nalasopara is working hard to ensure that the Indian American performers match their steps to Bollywood beats. 

 Choreographer  , along with his assistant Karthik Priyadarshan, conceptualized a seven-minute medley of Indian classical and Bollywood dance to be performed around 2pm (US time) on Thursday. “All 30 performers are being trained since three days,” Mukund told TOI. Former Miss India Manasvi Mamgai will lead the dance troupe at the function that will be held at West Lawn of the US Capitol from 9.30am (US time) on Thursday.
 
 Mukund said they have been told to be prepared in case they are asked to perform again on January 20. “We are giving our best. We hope to also perform on the swearing-in day of the 45th US President on Friday,” he added. 
 
 Mukund is from the Kings United India dance group that had won a bronze in the World Hip Hop Championship held in California in 2015. Mukund and his dancers shot to fame when their struggle and success story became the inspiration for the movie ABCD2.
