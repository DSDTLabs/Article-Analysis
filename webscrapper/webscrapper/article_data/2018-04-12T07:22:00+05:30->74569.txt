Shimla: Himachal Pradesh has taken several steps to curb littering, but there has not been any change on the ground and that needs to be changed, said additional chief secretary (environment, science and technology) Manisha Nanda on Wednesday, during a video conference with all deputy commissioners. 

 Nanda said this had been the casse even though the state government had extended compounding powers to 15 departments and down the hierarchy to the constable level. She directed all DCs to enforce Himachal Pradesh Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Control) Act, 1995, in letter and spirit.
 
 Nanda asked all DCs to work out an action plan for ensuring effective implementation of plastic-waste management practices and effective implementation of ‘Polythene Hatao, Paryavaran Bachao’ campaign in the state. Top officials of urban development, public works, tourism, police and forest departments also attended the video conference.
 
 Nanda directed the public works department to gear up for using plastic waste in road construction, and the urban development department to install cluster-based, solid-waste management plants in Baddi, Mandi, Dharamshala, Kangra and Manali towns. 
 
 She asked the rural development department to explore the possibility of preparing a plan to manage solid and liquid waste in rural areas to. 
 
 During the meeting, forest department was directed to issue instructions to all field officials to keep a check on littering of waste in forest land.
 
 Nanda said the state government would soon review the performance of all officers who have been granted powers under the HP Non-Biodegradable Garbage Act. 
 
 During the meeting, a report was also tabled which ranked Kullu, Kinnaur, Una, Shimla and Solan diistricts as the worst performers when it came to waste management.
