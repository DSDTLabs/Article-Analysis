Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has ordered notice to the state’s chief secretary in a case seeking to stop river sand trading in the state. 

 The division bench of justices M Venugopal and Abdul Quddhose ordered notice, when the case filed by M Rajendran from Trichy came up for admission. 
 
 The petitioner told the bench that as per the court’s order dated February 2, 2010 in a case, the government should have constituted state-level monitoring committee in 2010 itself regarding sand quarry business. But, it has not done so far. Hence, the government should be restrained from carrying out sand quarrying operation and sand business till it constitutes the committee. 
 
 As per the order, the committee should have a retired judge of the Madras high court as its chairman, a member secretary at its headquarters in Chennai, one district judge for each zone of Chennai, Tirunelveli, Coimbatore and Trichy, expert in water resources management and environmentalist. He said the government’s public works department is directly involved in quarrying of river sand and trading the same through online process. But, the officials are hand in glove with the truck owners, he said. 
 
 If someone wants to purchase sand online, he needs to submit registration number of the vehicle along with sand cost. After 10 days, authorities will send a text message to the customer who should collect the sand within 36 hours from receiving the SMS. Otherwise, the online registration will get cancelled. The vehicle owner collects Rs 1,400 per day as halt rent and charge Rs 70 per km. 
 
 This procedure results in the consumer to spend many thousands of rupees to purchase sand. Besides, officials are not selling the sand directly to the consumers, but to the truck owners, many of whom are smuggling the sand.
