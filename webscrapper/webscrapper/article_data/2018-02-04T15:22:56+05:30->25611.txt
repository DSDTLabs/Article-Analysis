A five-day literature festival recently concluded with sessions, debates, discussions, book launches and interactive sessions with writers, poets and filmmakers from across the globe. To conclude the literary mela, the Writers’ Ball was hosted at Taj Jai Mahal Palace, Civil Lines.

 Writers, authors, delegates who had busy schedules attending sessions and talks were spotted dancing to the tunes of music bands. Ashok Rathore, General Manager, Taj Jai Mahal Palace, said, “This is the first time when we hosted the Writers’ Ball. It is aptly referred to as, ‘Literary Kumbh Mela’; we left no stone unturned to conclude it with fanfare. We are particular about providing a good experience to our guests in terms of music, food and décor.”
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 Spotted were  , Sanjoy K Roy and others. We also spotted activist and actress   catching up with author  . Vani, a panellist at one of the sessions, said, “It was a great experience listening to such learned people. One of the best experiences was listening to filmmaker, novelist and poet  , who is one of my favourite authors. His novel The English Patient, which was later adapted into a movie is one of my favourites. When I met him, my first question was, ‘As a writer, how is to work closely with the filmmakers?’, followed by, ‘Do filmmakers, in the name of creative liberty, twist the original script?’ and more. I had a detailed discussion on various aspects of films inspired by novels.”
