GANDHINAGAR: Gujarat government has bought a Rs 110 crore ship from China for launching the ro-ro service between   in   and   near  . Earlier, the government had rolled out the service with a hired ship just before the 2017 Gujarat assembly polls. The new ship will be used permanently to ferry around 800 to 1,000 passengers and 65 luxury bus-sized vehicles every day between Ghogha and Dahej.

  
  
 A senior official privy to the development said, “With the commencement of the ro-pax service, the second phase of project will also be over. Presently, ro-pax vessel is undergoing refitting at a shipyard in China. The terminal is ready and dredging work is also over. The ship is expected to arrive by the end of this month and we are hopeful of starting the regular service from June. This ship will be in operation also during monsoon, except there is a bad weather.”
 
 “We expect that several luxury bus operators will use this service for travel to Surat and Mumbai from   as it would cut journey time and give a cruise ship-like experience to the passengers,” added the official.
