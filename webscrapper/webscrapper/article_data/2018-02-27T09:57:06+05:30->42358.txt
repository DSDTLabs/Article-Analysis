NEW DELHI: In Tuesday's early trade, equity markets were choppy as   slipped into the red after it gained more than 100 points in the morning.

 The 30-share BSE index opened with a jump of 113.81 points on 34,558.56. Broader 50-share NSE   opened above 10,600-mark, gaining 33 points. However, the indices could not hold on to the gains and were dragged down by state-run bank stocks, which have off late been the pivot of investor sentiments.
 
 On Monday, the markets had a good run with Sensex gaining more than 300 points during the day. But, as PNB revealed an additional fraud of Rs 1,300 crore, bearish sentiments once again took over the markets. The slip in state-run bank scrips spilled over to private bank and financial service stocks as well, as the respective sub-indices were losing more than half a per cent.
