NAGPUR: Junior college teachers from Nagpur division staged a protest on Thursday and demanded higher pay-scale and implementation of old pension scheme.

 Around 100 teachers took out a rally under the banner of Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association (VJCTA) from   to the office of deputy director of education in   and submitted a memorandum of demands.
 
 The teachers sought implementation of the old pension scheme to teachers. General secretary of VJCTA Ashok   said, “The government must implement pension plan that was in force earlier. Teachers appointed before 2005 receive pension as per old scheme. It must be made applicable to partially-granted teachers too.”
 
 He said, “Even in winter session, a grant of 20% was announced to eligible institutions by education minister  . But no steps were taken in that direction.” 
 
 Slogans were raised against Tawde and school education secretary   at the rally. Teachers from Nagpur, Bhandara, Gondia, Wardha and Chandrapur districts participated in the rally.
 
 The teachers also alleged that Nand Kumar was planning to close down 80,000 government-aided schools in the coming years. “The government has already shut 1,300 schools. Students with poor background would be badly affected if the government went ahead with Nand Kumar’s plans,” said Gavhankar. 
 
 “If the demands are not fulfilled, we would intensify protests and boycott valuation of board examination papers. We will also keep the schools shut on February 2 to press for the demands,” added Gavhankar. 
 
 The protesters also demanded withdrawal of a government resolution dated October 23, 2017. “The recent GR deprives us of pay hike and promotions. It is unfair to teachers who devoted their life for educating students,” said Vilas Kerde, city president of VJCTA.
