About 700 people attended the programme.

Therefore, it is necessary that the public also take necessary precautions to protect themselves from the disease that has no complete cure. However, no dengue-related deaths occurred in the district last year."
 
 Social worker and ward member of the area   said, "It is true that the Noonmati area witnesses several cases of dengue every year.

Timely treatment goes a long way in curing an ailment."
 
 Joint director (malaria)   explained various symptoms of dengue to the participants. "People should keep their surroundings clean and not let water collect in tubs and other containers. Containers should be kept covered as the dengue transmitting mosquito larvae breed well in water stored in such containers.
