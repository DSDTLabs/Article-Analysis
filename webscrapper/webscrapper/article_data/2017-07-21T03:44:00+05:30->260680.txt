Panaji: The Supreme Court has dismissed a civil appeal filed by Mormugao Port Trust ( ) challenging the National Green Tribunal order that quashed the environmental clearance granted by the central government.

 The Union ministry of environment forest and climate change had granted the clearance in February last year, exempting public consultation in the matter of capital dredging, allegedly in violation of the provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification 2006. 
 
 The apex court noted that as the public hearing on capital dredging was held and the matter is before the expert appraisal committee, it did not want to proceed with the appeal. tnn
