NEW DELHI:   saw a slugfest between   and the treasury benches on Friday over removing former PM Rajiv Gandhi’s name from   programmes and renaming schemes which were named after   and  .

 The government said central schemes would no longer carry the name of “one family” or one party under the Modi dispensation. Congress MP Chhaya Verma raised the matter in Rajya Sabha during zero hour. Joining issue, deputy leader of opposition Anand Sharma said, “The country owes a debt of gratitude to its martyrs... Rajiv Gandhi is a martyr of this country. He was the prime minister of India.”
 
 Sharma alleged that removing his name and photographs from government advertisements, circulars and notifications was “an insult to the memory of a great prime minister”.
 
 Leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said Rajiv Gandhi died for the unity of the country and his name could not be removed from government schemes. “The present government is naming schemes in the names of those who have not done anything for the country,” he said.
 
 Responding to the opposition, minister of state for parliamentary affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said, “The country has thousands of patriots who have sacrificed their lives for the country... They have contributed to the honour of this country.
 
 They want us to forget the contribution of all these people and name all government schemes after one party and one family. This is not possible in the Modi government.” The Modi government has renamed several schemes after Deen Dayal Upadhyay.
