‘Race 3’ starring  ,   Fernandez, Anil Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Saqib Saleem and   has created enough buzz among the audience. Not only is the third installment of the super successful franchise is everyone’s watch list, but the reunion of Salman and Jacqueline has got everyone’s heart racing. The film’s trailer was released earlier this week. The response to the same has been mixed, while a section criticized the theme, bhai fans, on the other hand, have been all praise about every aspect. 

 Post the trailer, one of the things that have been a talking point is   Shah’s dialogue. Although the actor is getting trolled for her “Our business is our business none of your business” dialogue from the   trailer, is, in fact, enjoying the reactions and using it to promote the film.
 
 Although, this wasn’t the case initially because Daisy’s first reaction was quite blunt. She posted a message on social media, “To all The people who think they are too smart. Create ur own identity 1st n ‘GET A LIFE’, Wait! I am sure u don’t have any #patheticLosers”. 
 
 However, with the dialogue turning out to be a trend in itself, Daisy and her co-star Jacqueline have been taking it sportily. Instead, the two have chosen to use this as one of ‘Race 3’ promotion tools. 
 Through a series of videos, Daisy and Jacqueline have staged funny situations where they can use the “Our business” dialogue.
