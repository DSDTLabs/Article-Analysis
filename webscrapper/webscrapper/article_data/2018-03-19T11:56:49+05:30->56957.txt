KOCHI: Despite the state government giving assurances about promoting public transport systems in the city, they have not yet taken the task of enacting the   ( ) bill, which is essential for integrating public transport systems.

 Though cabinet nod has been accorded for the UMTA bill, it is yet to be presented in the legislative assembly.
 
 “If the government really intends to augment public transport sector they should not delay enacting the UMTA bill. It is essential for planning, managing, coordinating and controlling the transport sector in Kochi,” said a Kochi   official. The bill has been long-pending before the government waiting to be taken up for discussion in the assembly.
 
 UMTA is envisioned as an umbrella body coordinating various agencies involved in providing public transport services within the urban areas. According to   ( ), many decisions taken to integrate public transport systems will become legally binding only when UMTA act comes into effect. They say that the act will give the necessary legal backing, and makes the implementation process less complicated.
 
 “Without UMTA act it will not be possible to integrate various modes of public transport systems. It plays a major role in implementing single-ticketing systems, which is a key to KMRL’s plans to integrate public transport systems,” added the Metro official. Meanwhile, sources with KMRL said that the UMTA bill is expected to present in the state assembly shortly. “It is listed in the agenda,” said an official.
 
 However, agencies like transport department,  , motor vehicle department, Kochi corporation and district administration maintained that they did not have any updates about the UMTA bill.
