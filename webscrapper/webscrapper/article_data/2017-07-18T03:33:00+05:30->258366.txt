Panaji: Chief minister Manohar Parrikar on Monday said that National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) will conduct the environmental impact assessment for the Bainguinim and Verna solid waste treatment plants and that both the projects would be tendered by September. Speaking at corporation of the city of Panaji, Parrikar urged CCP to pass a resolution and hand over the land to the Goa waste management corporation as soon as possible. “NEERI has been appointed to prepare the environmental assessment report and in another two months they will conduct a public hearing. By September, tendering will start for the plant at Bainguinim and Verna. So, maybe, by December 2018, the plant will start,” Parrikar said. The Bainguinim waste management facility will cater to garbage from municipal areas in North Goa together with waste generated by the city and part of Ponda. The facility is proposed to be set up with funds from the Union ministry of urban development along with a contribution from the state government under the Swachh Bharat Mission. The state government in 2006 had issued a notification for land acquisition at Bainginium and in 2008, land was awarded measuring 1.75 lakh sqm to CCP. In a recent meeting, Parrikar asked CCP to hand over the land to the solid waste management corporation.  Parrikar also informed the councilors that the garbage treatment facility behind Heera petrol pump was being completed with discussions to introduce a new technology for decomposition of biodegradable waste.  “It is a new technology that does not require power, it just uses triple membrane cover which causes a reaction which leads to high temperature due to which the decomposition increases and in 16-18 days the waste is turned to compost. It can handle around 5 tonnes of garbage per day,” Parrikar said.
