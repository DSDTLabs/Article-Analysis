NEW DELHI: State government departments, particularly the  , are putting up road blocks in the implementation of   order against liquor shops along highways, feels the man who is behind the move. 

 "The SC order and several advisories of Central government have clearly talked about liquor vends and shops. The excise departments are expanding it simply to see more people approach the court seeking clarification. There have been several instances in past when liquor shop lobby even went to the extent claiming that they were running offices for their business from these outlets," said   of  . Sidhu had filed the PIL in the apex court seeking removal of liquor shops along national and state highways. 
 
 Sidhu said states are coming out with new explanations and ideas to avoid implementation of the court order. For example, there is a view in Uttar Pradesh government that expressways are not covered under the court ruling.
 
 Sidhu added that there is also a proposal to denotify all state highways in and around Chandigarh so that liquor shops can keep operating without fear.
 
 Sources in road transport ministry said they kept on writing to the states to remove liquor shops along highways, but the local governments never paid heed. Finally, when the Supreme Court cracked down on them, liquor lobby is claiming that they are staring at huge loss in their business. 
 
 The SC has banned operating any liquor shop within 500 metres along the national and state highways to check dunk driving on these high speed corridors.
