KOLHAPUR: The   (KMC) has decided to impound the properties and freeze the bank accounts of 40 traders who did not pay the   (LBT) during the period 2011 to 2015. 

 KMC’s LBT officer Ram Katkar said, “We have decided to impound the properties and freeze the bank accounts of 40 traders for not paying the dues amounting to Rs 60 lakh. Representatives of the traders associations had demanded more time for the traders to pay the dues. But, the deadline set for the demand notices has been ended last week and the action will be taken any time. Some traders have offered to pay the dues partly but it is not allowed as per the rules.”
 
 The LBT came into effect in 2011 and was abolished in August 2015 for traders having less than Rs 50 crore annual turnover. It was the most important revenue source for the civic body. Now, the government gives a monthly grant of Rs 7 crore to Rs 8 crore as compensation for the LBT revenue. 
 
 While abolishing the LBT, the government had directed the civic bodies to assess the tax paid and not paid by the traders and recover the dues from evaders. The civic body has initiated assessment for the period from 2011 to 2015 and started issuing demand notices to traders.
 
 In the past one year the KMC could complete assessment of just 120 traders owing to opposition from traders to submit the details of transactions such as sales tax bills and sale-purchase receipts. The civic body has launched an amnesty scheme, under which traders who pay the dues in one instalment will get 50% concession in late charges. Officials said 2,776 traders have opted for the scheme and civic body has undertaken the assessment work of such traders in the first phase ending in March this year. 
 
 “By March we have to complete the assessment work for those seeking concession. These traders have evaded tax during the implementation period. The other traders have complained about the rates at which the LBT is calculated. The complaint is handed over to the government for a decision. The demand of the traders to stop assessment work till the final decision comes cannot be fulfilled at any circumstances,” Katkar said.
