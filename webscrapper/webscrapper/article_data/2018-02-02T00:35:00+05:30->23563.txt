Chennai: A day after a 39-year-old man was apprehended for making sexual remarks and harassing Kollywood actress Amala Paul, police questioned her manager Pradeep on Thursday. 

 Police arrested T Azhageswaran, who works as a salesperson at a garments showroom on East Coast Road (ECR), for making sexual remarks to the actor at a dance school on Mannar Street in T Nagar on Wednesday.
 
 During questioning, Azhageswaran told police that he had come to the dance school on her manager Pradeep’s invitation. However, during questioning, Pradeep denied the allegations and asked police to check his call log .
 
 Azhageswaran claimed that his friend Baskar, a businessman, had given Amala Paul’s phone number and had asked him to get in touch with her through a Malaysian number. Azhageswaran also told police that he had come to ask Amala Paul if she’d pay a visit to Ibrahim, a businessman in Malaysia, a day after her scheduled programme to be held in the weekend.
 
 Police said, “We will inquire into the issue based on Azhageswaran’s confession to the police.” 
 
 Police personnel have sought the mobile service provider to furnish the call details of Baskar and Ibrahim. They will soon summon the duo for an inquiry, police said.
