NAGPUR: The   (MUHS) has finally agreed to change the centre for practical examination for three MD students of   from the   (GMCH) to Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences ( ), Sewagram, instead of the TN Medical College in Mumbai allotted earlier.

 The change in the exam centre comes following the visit of a three-member fact finding team of MUHS to the GMCH on last Tuesday. The team met the three students and also made them fill out a questionnaire. The students will be now examined at MGIMS on January 17 and 18. MUHS sent a letter to the GMCH dean Dr A Niswade about the change in the centre. The students said that they were more than happy with the change as it’s near to Nagpur.
 
 The three students — Pratik Gilbe, Laxman Phad and Kunal Shirsat — had written a letter to the MUHS on December 17 stating that the first two students were purposely failed in the practical examination by the present HOD of Forensic Medicine in GMCH under the influence of the former HOD. 
 
 The students had requested to allot   as an alternative exam centre. But the university authorities said that it was not possible as it was not a centre this year for MD examination (Forensic Medicine).
 
 MUHS controller of exam KD Chouhan said the university has agreed to change the centre in the interest of students to avoid controversies.
