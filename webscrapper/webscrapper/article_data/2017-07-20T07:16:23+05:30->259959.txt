AHMEDABAD: Nine hotels from across the state, which have licences to serve liquor to permit holders, moved Gujarat high court against the state government’s decision to put their licenses in abeyance after the Supreme Court’s diktat to prohibit the sale of liquor within 500m of state and national highways.

 One of the nine petitioners is Novotel Hotel, located on SG Highway. Ramada Hotel, which has been affected due to the prohibition and excise director’s order to close wine shops, had approached the HC last month. The HC sought a reply from the state authorities and the hearing on the petitions of all 10 hotels will likely take place on Thursday.
 
 The hotels, through advocate M G Nagarkar, have questioned the government passed on April 1 by which the renewed licences to serve liquor have been suspended. The petition contends that the decision was taken without appreciating the SC directives, because the diktat cannot be made applicable in Gujarat, where sale and consumption of liquor, particularly  , is governed by the Bombay Prohibition Act and the Bombay Foreign Liquor Rules.
 
 The petition states that sale of liquor has been regulated in Gujarat and the rules have been made more stringent. It is sold to only those with liquor permits, and nobody else can buy it over the counter. Thus, the apprehension that drivers would get easy access to liquor is misplaced, under the stringent prohibition laws in Gujarat. In such a scenario, the decision to put the liquor licences in abeyance, without giving the hotels a hearing is nothing but arbitrariness by the government.
 
 The petitioners urged the HC to revoke the government’s decision also on ground that the licences were renewed after the SC directives, on the basis of the bona fide belief of the hotels and the government that the apex court’s diktat would not be applicable in Gujarat because of the pre-existing prohibition policy.
