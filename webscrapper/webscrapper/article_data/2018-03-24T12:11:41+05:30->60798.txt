PATNA: State health minister   said in the state assembly on Friday that only 6,830 doctors have been attending to healthcare needs of people against the requirement of 17,685 doctors as per the projected 2018 population of the state.

 Pandey, while replying to the short-notice question of   member  , admitted there was acute shortage of doctors in the state, but maintained that efforts were being made to appoint new doctors.
 
 “The wide gap between the actual requirement and availability of doctors is being narrowed through the appointment of doctors on contractual basis, as well as by recruiting doctors who have retired, to deliver healthcare services in the rural areas under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM),” Pandey said, adding 1,805 general doctors and 665 specialist doctors selected by the Bihar Public Service Commission (BPSC) have been appointed.
 
 The minister also admitted that the   (WHO) norms warrant that there should be one doctor per 1,000 persons. The minister said   (TCS) of the state has also been asked to select doctors by adhering to proper norms.
 
 Congress MLAs stall proceedings: Unsatisfied with the health minister’s reply to the short-notice question of senior Congress member   regarding steps taken to prevent adulteration in spices being sold in the market, the Congress legislators entered the well of the House.
 
 Pandey told the House that the health department’s wing had raided shops selling spices in Patna and other parts of the state to collect samples. “Of the 900 samples collected, only five were found adulterated,” he said.
 
 In response to Rai’s question regarding action taken against the erring shopkeepers, the minister said the department had recommended their prosecution and the matter was at the trial stage in courts.
 
 However, this did not convince the Congress members, who entered the well of the House.
