NEW DELHI: The committee formed by the   ( ) administration to constitute guidelines for compulsory   in the campus has come out with its recommendations. From the winter session 2018, a minimum of 75% attendance is necessary for all part-time programmes — BA, MA, MTech, PG Diploma, MPhil and PhD — to appear in the end-semester for that course.

 Despite the protests by students and several teachers, the committee formed by the   (AC) has suggested several rules for students.
 
 If a student of the   is absent from class on medical grounds, he or she   get a certification from the chief medical officer (CMO) of the JNU health centre, and can be considered for the end-semester exams with only a 60% attendance.
 
 The guidelines also point that for MPhil and PhD students, at least two interaction sessions with the supervisor in a month is mandatory and absence from the university on academic grounds must have “prior approval of the supervisor/chairperson of the centre concerned.”
 
 Leave of absence to the students will be granted by the dean of the schools and chairperson of the special centre on the recommendation of the research advisory committee on “valid medical grounds.”
 
 The university will provide an attendance sheet to the teachers who will put in the information and submit it to their respective schools/centres. 
 
 The JNU Student’s Union (JNUSU), which has been opposing the decision of the university, has announced that they will be burning the circular on January 12 and have called for a strike on January 15.
