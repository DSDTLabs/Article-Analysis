After spending close to 5 years for the first and second part of 'Baahubali', actor   is now finally relieved as his efforts paid off.

 
 The movie has already broke the records at international level and emerged as the one which grossed the highest ever from any language that is made in India.'Baahubali' also shot the director Rajamouli along with Prabhas to international fame.
 
 
 Having said enough about 'Baahubali', the darling star of Tollywood is back to normalcy and is out of 'Mahishmati' kingdom. He was rumoured to get hitched this year but then the actor seems in no mood to rush with his impending marriage. Instead, Prabhas is now fully focused about his upcoming two Telugu projects.
 
 The actor who spoke to a news channel earlier was heard saying that he is currently occupied with two of his Telugu projects and wouldn't mind taking up Hindi projects if anything gets his interest.
 
 
 Apparently, the actor will begin regular shooting of 'Saaho', under the direction of Sujeeth, whose teaser was released on April 28 to breaking YouTube records. Another one will be under the direction of Radha Krishna, which will begin immediately. Interestingly, UV Creations will bankroll both these projects with Saaho being an action entertainer and the film with Radha Krishna, being a love story.
 
 
 
 Radha Krishna was quoted in an interview saying that the movie will be shot entirely in a foreign location and the team are currently on a recce for the same. Saaho is scheduled to hit the screens early next year.
