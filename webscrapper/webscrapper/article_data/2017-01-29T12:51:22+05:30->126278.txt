Veteran actor  , known for his outspoken nature, said he just 'cannot be a friend' to his son   when it comes to discussing personal life. 

  
  
 Though the 64-year-old star says he has all the love for his son, he prefers respecting each other's private space. Shedding light on his relationships with his father,  , he said, "I never argued with my father and it so happened that unfortunately the same kind of relationship passed on with me and Ranbir." 
 
 "I really want that there should be love and respect between me and Ranbir, but at the same time I want that there should be some kind of distance that I can see you but I can't feel you," the veteran actor said. The actor was in conversation with author   at the launch of his book titled 'Khullam Khull: Rishi Kapoor Uncensored', which was attended by his wife   and daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni. 
 
 Rishi says that he may be wrong with what he feels about his relationship with Ranbir but he wants to keep it that way. "I know I'm wrong. Ranbir has his own point of view about it while I have my own. He feels that when he is going to have kids he is not going to be like me. Call it a generation gap or whatever I'm like that." 
 
 Rishi said that all through Ranbir's childhood he was busy working in films and was unable to give that much time to him. "I was extremely busy during Ranbir's childhood days and he was more close to Neetu probably he felt that he needs his father but I'm sorry I just can't and I'm failed. I can't be a friend father to a son. I was never that way with my father as well. You have to accept the way I am." 
 
 The tell-all book sees the 'Bobby' star revealing some of the flustering aspects of his life, where he talked about his father and filmmaker Raj Kapoor's affairs with co-actors and his passion for cinema, besides capturing the evolution of their father-son relationship.
