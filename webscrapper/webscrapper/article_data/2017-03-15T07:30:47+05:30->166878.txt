 She said that on March 7, RGUHS' planning board expressed its inability to shift from the existing premises.It was decided that the issue of shifting the university would be brought to the notice of the syndicate and they would act according to the syndicate's decision.
 
 She said that students from other districts would find it inconvenient to travel to Ramanagara if the headquarters is shifted. The petitioners said that as per Section 3(4) of the RGUHS Act, 1994, the Bengaluru campus at Jayanagar can be retained as an additional campus.
 
 “The tortuous aim is to force the university into paying for construction of a new building and campus, a project worth approximately Rs 520 crore and arm-twist the university into building a hospital etc. with absolutely no contribution from the government. The government would unscrupulously choose the builder, allot works contract, gain from a free hospital, all from the funds of RGUHS which come from the fees paid by students. The respondents have no right or authority over the money paid by the petitioners and students to RGUHS,“ petitioners B R Ramakrishna and others have contended.
