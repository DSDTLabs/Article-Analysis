HYDERABAD: It is movements like the one going on at   that’s given my mother the strength to keep going, after my brother went missing, said Najeeb’s brother Haseeb Ahmed.

 Najeeb Ahmed, a student at Delhi’s JNU went mysteriously missing from campus on October 15 last year.
 
 “One day before my brother went missing, he was threatened by   members that he won't see the sunrise next day and it turned out to be true. When my mother went to lodge a complaint, the police made it clear that the case won't be registered as per our complaint, but according to their own wish," he said, adding, “They made some insensitive remarks and asked us why my brother did not call 100, when he was threatened.”
 
 Accusing the university Vice-Chancellor and other authorities of not cooperating with his family, Haseeb vowed to continue his fight till his brother is found. “So far, we have no clue about where my brother is. No matter what happens we will continue our protest, till we find him," he said, thanking the crowd outside UoH for their support.
 
 Najeeb’s mother, who was also expected to participate in Tuesday’s event, couldn't travel owing to her illness.
