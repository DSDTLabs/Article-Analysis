Surat: If you have fitted crash guards or bull bars on your car, be prepared to face music. Acting on the directions of the state government and ministry of road transport and highways, regional transport office (RTO) has started a campaign in the Diamond City to nab those who have fitted crash guards on their cars in violation of the Motor Vehicles Act.  RTO officials said crash guards not only pose a danger to pedestrians, but could cause failure of air bags in a car during an accident, resulting in heavy damage to the engine and passengers. The Motor Vehicles Act clearly states that no owner of a motor vehicle shall so alter the vehicle that the particulars contained in the certificate of registration are at variance with those originally specified by the manufacturer. The RTO has been collecting fine starting from Rs 400 to Rs 1,000 depending upon the size of the vehicle. Majority of vehicles plying on roads are fitted with crash guards made up of iron, steel or aluminium, to avoid scratches or damage to vehicles, especially the engine. Most of the government vehicles, including those hired by central and state government departments, too, have crash guards fitted on them.  “The law is for everyone, be it common people or government officials. Crash guard poses a serious threat to pedestrians and is totally unsafe at the time of accident. It’s a misconception that a crash guard protects the vehicle. It actually destroys the engine and leads to higher fatalities at the time of accident,” in-charge regional transport officer Parth Joshi said. Joshi added, “The department is coordinating with auto parts dealers across the city and district and sensitizing them to not sell crash guards and inform the department about car owners not heeding to the directions.”
