PATNA: Over 1 lakh people, mostly Sikh pilgrims, visited   this week. The footfall of visitors, according to museum officials, rose manifold on account of Prakashotsava as a large number of devotees had congregated in the city from across the country and abroad for the event. The museum normally registers footfall of around 40,000 visitors in a week.

 “The photo exhibition, ‘Emperor Prophet, Guru Gobind Singh Sahib’, was a hit among the visitors. The exhibition, which is based on Sikh gurus and the history of Sikhism, will continues till January 31,” said J P N Singh, assistant director, Bihar Museum. “The manuscripts being showcased in the gallery are all illuminated,” said Moumita Ghosh, the curator of the museum.
 
 Satyapal Singh, a businessman from Chandigarh, thanked the state government for allowing free entry of visitors to the museum during Prakashotsava celebrations. “The installations and pictures in the museum are marvellous. I loved the giant tree made of grass, which was displayed in the children’s gallery. The museum is a landmark for the city,” he said, adding that Punjabi display boards helped the devotees a lot as most of them do not know Hindi and English.
 
 Even locals enjoyed the exhibition. “I have come here with my family to see the exhibition. It is very entertaining and informative,” said  , a businessman from Danapur. 
 
 Students were also seen clicking selfies at the museum. Rahul Kumar, a   student, who visited the museum with his brother, too praised the state government for organising such an informative exhibition.
