CHANDIGARH:   chief minister   on Monday said he would urge   defence minister   to simplify and speed up clearances required for shooting war movies and biopics on war heroes.

 Amarinder, himself a retired Captain and a military historian, gave an assurance to producer-director J P Dutta when the latter called on the chief minister with the team of his next movie ‘Paltan’. The movie is centred around the 1967 India-China clashes at   in Sikkim.
 
 Dutta, who is currently shooting for the movie in Punjab, said filmmakers were seriously constraint by the fact that multiple clearances were required while making defence-related movies. This led to major delays, often deterring filmmakers from making such films.
 
 The chief minister said making war movies and biopics on war heroes was in the interest of the defence forces as such movies could help inspire youngsters to join the armed forces.
