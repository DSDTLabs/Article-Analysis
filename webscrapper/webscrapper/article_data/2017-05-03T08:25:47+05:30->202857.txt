TRICHY: A newly-opened Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) outlet at   has raised the bar in luring its customers by building a   across a river nearby and saving boozers from a   on the main road leading to the shop. 

 Tipsy customers on two-wheelers who have been falling 'prey' to cops at the checkpost on the way to E Pudur and Trichy city can now take the bridge over Koraiayaru river instead to avoid police. 
 
 What had made things difficult for boozers was that both the Tasmac outlets at Kirapatti and E Pudur were shut for being close to the Madurai road. 
 
 That was when an outlet along the Koraiyaru river at an isolated location near E Pudur gave a new lease of life to them. People at E Pudur and Kirapatti either had to go all the way to the central bus stand located 5km away or to Nagamangalam travelling 14km to buy liquor. But returning tipsy from the new outlet on two-wheeler came with the danger of getting caught by police at E Pudur checkpost. 
 
 "I had to grease the palms several times of policemen who see me going to the shop and stop me while I return," said S Murugan, 46 who was a regular to the outlet. 
 
 "People came in large numbers in the initial days after knowing about the new   but soon there was a gradual decline," said a Tasmac employee. "To help the tipplers have a hassle-free return after their visit to the Tasmac outlet near E Pudur, we decided to raise a makeshift bridge," he said. The small bridge made of bamboo illegally raised without the knowledge of   has now increased the flow of customers to the outlet.
