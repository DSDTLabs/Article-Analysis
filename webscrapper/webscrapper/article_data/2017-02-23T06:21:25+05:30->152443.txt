GUWAHATI: A lawyer and one of the prime accused in the   assault case,   alias Jewel, was arrested in Goalpara on Wednesday. 

 With Omar's arrest, police have so far arrested eight persons involved in the case, including Nazrul Islam, who allegedly instigated the assault on Phukan, a member of additional foreigners' tribunal in Goalpara. Last Wednesday, Nazrul and his cohorts reached Phukan's court chamber and thrashed him following a heated argument regarding a judgment passed by the tribunal earlier. 
 
 "Two other accused - Aynul Haq and Moinal Haq - were arrested on Tuesday evening," said SP (Goalpara) Amitava Sinha.
 
 On February 9, the tribunal had declared eight persons from the district's Bagnawara area as 'foreigners'. Unhappy with the judgment, a group of lawyers assaulted the tribunal member.
 
 On the other hand, the Patriotic Peoples' Front of Assam (PPFA) has urged the Supreme Court to take note of the incident and asked the   to take action against the culprits.
 
 "We would like to urge the Supreme Court, which constituted the foreigners tribunals for expediting identification and determination of illegal migrants, to take serious note of the incident," said   of PPFA. The forum described the accused lawyers as 'anti-nationals'. 
 
 Gauhati high court bar association president RC Saikia, too, demanded action against the erring lawyers who violated the sanctity of the profession. 
 
 The foreigners' tribunals were set up to try the 'D' voter cases as hundreds of suspected foreigners have been languishing in detention camps in Kokrajhar and Goalpara for years. There are some 1, 43,227 'D' voters in the state.
