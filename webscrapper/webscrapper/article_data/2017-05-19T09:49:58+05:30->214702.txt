Utekar said she was two months pregnant when the incident happened.

 While the cops are yet to file an FIR in the case and have only recorded the victim’s statement so far, VVMC officials dismissed Utekar’s allegations and claimed that nobody protested when the demolition was carried out.
 
 According to Utekar, VVMC’s demolition team began work at around 2 pm on Wednesday. “I was sleeping in the afternoon when I heard the men throwing out my sewing machines and other belongings. When I tried to stop them, one lady pushed me due to which I fell on the ground,” said Alisha. Utekar ran “Abla Mahila Naari Prashikshanani Sallagar Kendra” – a stitching training centre for women in the neighbourhood. 
 “I was first taken to the police station and then to the hospital where they suggested I get a sonography test done. This confirmed the miscarriage,” added Alisha, whose husband works as a driver with a travel agency.
 
 Utekar’s version was confirmed by a local leader who further blamed the police of inaction. “It’s been more than 24 hours but an FIR is yet to be registered by the police. They have only recorded her statement so far,” said Janardan Patil, Palghar president of the Agri Sena.
 
 Virar police inspector Younus Shaikh said, “We have taken the victim’s statement. We will talk to the demolition team for further inquiry.”
 
 Meanwhile, VVMC dismissed Utekar’s version of events. “These are baseless allegations. No one was present there when we demolished the structure,” said Smita Bhoir, assistant municipal commissioner of VVMC.
