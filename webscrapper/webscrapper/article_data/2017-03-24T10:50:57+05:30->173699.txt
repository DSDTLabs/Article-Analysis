NASHIK: Untreated industrial effluents from the Tigrania estate have been spotted flowing into the   below   here. 

 In July 2012, the   (MPCB) had issued show cause notices to 11 industries in the area discharging effluents into the river following a TOI report. The discharge is once again seen in this area.
 
 “Untreated industrial effluents are clearly seen flowing into   at Swaminarayan Bridge from Tigrania industrial area. It does not seem like effluents from different industries. But it is for the pollution control board to find out the source. We have informed them about the issue,” said environment activist Rajesh Pandit, who had filed a public interest litigation in the Bombay high court against government officials for the Godavari pollution. 
 
 MPCB sub-regional officer A J Kude said, “We will inspect the place and take necessary action against the guilty. We will test the water for the pollutant and serve notices to those who are polluting the river.” 
 
 In 2012, MPCB officials had visited the spot and issued proposed show cause notices to the 11 small scale industries at Tigrania road near   bridge in Tapovan. The field officers paid another surprise visit in August and noticed a similar situation. 
 
 The MPCB had issued notices under section 33 (a) of Water Pollution Act, giving the industrial units 15 days to clarify why those should not be closed down. Fifteen-days after the show cause notices, the MPCB had failed to take action.
 
 MPCB officials had then said these industries have been in existence before the River Regulation Zone Policy came to being. 
 
 The industrialists on the other hand said that the NMC had connected their sewage pipes with the sewage treatment plant at Tapovan around July-August 2012. However, they have not yet constructed the effluent treatment plant.
