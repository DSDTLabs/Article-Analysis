HYDERABAD: Judicial work at the   suffered for the second consecutive day on Friday with advocates from both   and AP High Court Advocates’ Associations continuing their strike. Advocates are on strike seeking filling up of vacant judge posts at the HC and setting up of a   at Hyderabad. The protesters went to all court halls and requested both the benches and the advocates to abstain from work. The CJ court heard urgent pleas when advocates sought the same.

 The strike raised hopes about the setting up of an apex court bench at Hyderabad. If it materialises, this would make Hyderabad a legal headquarters for South India, a lawyer said.
 
 The leaders of AP and Telangana HC Bar Associations, Challa Dhanamjaya and  , declared that they would give the central authorities 15 days time to respond. “We will also send a combined delegation to New Delhi to air our grievances, demands and aspirations. If nothing comes out during this period, we will think in terms of chalking out our future strategy, which will be mostly aggressive,” they said.
