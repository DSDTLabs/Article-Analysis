CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday issued notice to the   asking him why   should not be initiated against him for not taking any action on the plea of   of the state against forcible takeover of   during rallies of the ruling party.

 Earlier in October last year, the HC had asked the state to take appropriate steps on the plea filed by Federation of Private Schools Welfare Associations, Haryana, within six weeks.
 
 “The principal secretary, department of home, shall consider and decide the same at an early date by passing an appropriate order thereon, strictly in accordance with law, but in any case within a period of six weeks from the date of receipt of representation from the petitioner on the issue,“ Justice Rameshwar Malik had observed in his orders on October 16, 2016.
 
 As the state authorities failed to decide the petitioner's representation, the federation filed a petition seeking directions to initiate contempt of court proceedings against home secretary for not complying with HC directions. Hearing the plea, Justice Jaswant Singh asked the Haryana home secretary to file his reply on the issue by March 14.
 
 In its petition, the federation has said that it was aggrieved with the action of the government under which school buses were used by the ruling party to organize public rallies and ferry the general public at the cost of the small children.
 
 It was further said the school buses were not only taken outside the permissible limit for which the route permits are being granted, but also taken to other states.
 
 “The school authorities are being pressurized to send their buses beyond the route permit. In case some accident happens, the school authorities would be personally liable for that as insurance company will repudiate the claim for violation of the terms and condition of the policy,“ the Federation has claimed.
