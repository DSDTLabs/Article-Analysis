PATIALA: Sikh body   has asked the SGPC to review the   calendar, saying that "it misrepresents facts about martyr Bhai Mani Singh." Mission head Dalip Singh Bikkar, who has taken up the matter with the Sikh high priests and SGPC president Kirpal Singh Badungar, said the dates of birth and martyrdom of   had been misrepresented in the calendar. 

 Bhai Mani Singh, who had remained head granthi of   for over 33 years, had been ordered death by dismemberment by governor of Lahore Zakaria Khan in 1737 as he had failed to pay a tax of Rs 5,000 asked by the Mughals to grant permission for holding a ceremony to mark Bandi Chhor Divas at the Golden Temple. 
 
 Bikkar said he and other members of the mission had put up the matter before the SGPC and the Sikh clergy that Bhai Mani Singh, who had served under Guru Har Rai, Guru Har Krishan, Guru Tegh Bahadur and Guru Gobind Singh, was born at Alipur Samali village in Multan, now in Pakistan, on March 10, 1644. He attained martyrdom on June 24, 1734, when he was dismembered at Nakhas chowk in Lahore, which later came to be known at Nawan chowk. "The present Nanakshahi calendar has no mention of the date of birth of Bhai Mani Singh, who was the 23rd descendant of Rajput king Vikramaditya. The calendar states that Bhai Mani Singh was killed in Delhi on July 9, 1734, which is totally incorrect," he said.
