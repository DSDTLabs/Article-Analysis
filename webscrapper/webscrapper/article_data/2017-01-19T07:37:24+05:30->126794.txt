HYDERABAD: The Telangana government told the   on Wednesday that it wants to increase the penalty imposed on anyone riding a two-wheeler without a helmet to Rs 1,000. At present, a first-time offender is fined Rs 100 and the fine doubles for a repeated offender. The state also disclosed that it has already sent a proposal to the   urging it to amend the Motor Vehicles Act duly incorporating the increase in the penalty. Telangana's special gov ernment pleader A Sanjeev Kumar told this to a bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akthar which was hearing a petition filed by V Rama Rao of Ranga Reddy district who questioned the inaction of states in implementing the provisions of the MV Act and in not penalising those who ignore the helmet rule.

 The bench too said that since the MV Act is a central act, all that a state can do is send its proposals to the Cen tre. It said that it was important to know the Centre's response on the issue. Since the petitioner has not made Centre a party to the case, the bench asked him to do the same so that it could direct the Centre to file its response in writing.
 
 The petitioner in his plea told the court that state governments have not been implementing Section 129 of the Motor Vehicles Act and Rules 430 and 486 of the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989, which have penal provisions and are enforceable with effect from September 1, 1989. The bench heard the case last year and asked the governments to file counter affidavits.
 
 When the case hearing resumed on Wednesday , the bench sought to know the response of states. Kumar told the court that in the last one year, 3.84 lakh cases had been booked against helmet rule violators. But since the current act provides for paltry fines, bike riders commit the same offence repeatedly and paying up penalties without any remorse.
