NEW DELHI: Scaling down its ambitions in the upcoming municipal elections Janata Dal (United) has decided to contest only 150 of the 272 seats across east, north and south   municipal corporations. 

 Earlier, the party had announced that JD(U) contest all 272 seats, but soon realised that the challenge is too huge with the current footing. Now JD(U) has said it will contest only 150 seats scattered across the three corporations.
 
 “We have entered the battleground with more energy and enthusiasm even though we are not contesting on 122 of the 272 seats. There is no let-up in efforts,” said Sanjay Jha, JD(U) national general secretary and Delhi in-charge.
 
 The party is working out details of its fifth list. “We have received more than 1000 applications for tickets, but we are shortlisting only the winning ones and will field 150 candidates,” Jha said.
