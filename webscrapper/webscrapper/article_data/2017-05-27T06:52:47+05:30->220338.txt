CHENNAI:   Hotels and Restaurants Association (SIHRA) has decided to back  's decision to hold a dawn-to-dusk protest against proposed GST rates for the hospitality industry on Tuesday.

 “SIHRA has decided to support the protest and requests all its members to participate in the bandh. Hotel associations of Karnataka,  , Telangana and Puducherry have extended support,“ a statement from the association said on Friday.
 
 While the industry was still trying to come to terms with the liquor ban issue, the statement said the Union finance minister had dropped a bombshell with new tax rates of 12%-28% under GST on restaurants and hotels.
 
 Despite numerous representations, the government has proposed a levy of 5% to 18% on different categories of restaurants and the highest rate applicable is 28%, on hotels with room tariff above Rs 5,000 day, it said.
