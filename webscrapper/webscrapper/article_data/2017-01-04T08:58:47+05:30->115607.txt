AHMEDABAD: In a fresh twist to the sudden scrapping of   for   M.Com students, the dean of the   declared on Tuesday that the decision won’t be rolled back. The move came one day after members of the GU board of studies as well as statistics professors submitted a memorandum to the vice chancellor opposing the varsity’s move to scrap the subject.

 “The decision has been taken after taking the members of GU syndicate as well as the academic council into confidence. We decided to scrap the subject after consulting the members and it is not an overnight decision,” said Saurabh Choksi, dean, commerce faculty.
 
 The varsity officials claim that since students opt for a specialization in M.Com, statistics is not an important subject for all specializations and therefore, it need not be compulsory. The move sent ripples across the varsity’s department of statistics as well as the board of studies. In fact, faculty members feel that this will cause a serious dent to the appointment of various statistics professors.
