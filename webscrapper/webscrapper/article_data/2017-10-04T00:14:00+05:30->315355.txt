Bhopal: Satna has become the first district in the state where schoolchildren have started answering the daily roll call with ‘Jai Hind’. After compulsory flag hoisting was introduced in Madhya Pradesh schools, state school education minister Vijay Shah had asked officials to make ‘Jai Hind’ mandatory for students to answer their roll call from October 1. Following his orders, the district education officer of Satna issued a letter to all principals and headmasters of government-run schools to implement the order from October 3.

 “As education minister Vijay Shah wanted students to answer roll call with ‘Jai Hind’ in schools, principals, headmasters and teachers are hereby directed to implement his orders with immediate effect,” states the letter, a copy of which is in possession of TOI. It further reads that students should be “encouraged” to say ‘Jai Hind.’
 
 Satna is the first district where this practice has been introduced in the state. Shah had said that the decision was taken to instill a sense of patriotism among students. “Students say ‘yes sir’ or `yes madam' or ‘present' during the roll call. These English acknowledgements are meaningless,so I have asked principals of government schools in Satna to direct the students to say ‘Jai Hind'. This practice will be implemented across the state.”
 
 While the new decree has been issued to government schools, the minister wants to take permission from chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to implement it in all schools of the state, including private institutions. “I will take permission from the chief minister. If the experiment is successful, it will be implemented across MP. I will bring a proposal in the state cabinet,” he said.
 
 While it is just a suggestion for private schools in the region, the minister hopes “they'll adhere to it since it relates to patriotism.”
