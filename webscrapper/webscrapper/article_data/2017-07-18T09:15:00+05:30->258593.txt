LUCKNOW: BSP chief   on Monday took the credit for “forcing” the BJP-led   to field a  ,  , for the presidential race. Shortly after casting her vote, Mayawati said that irrespective of who wins, the next President will be from the Scheduled Castes.

 “Losing-winning is different. But the good part is that eventually, a person from Schedule Castes category will become the President of India. It is a huge victory for our movement and party,” Mayawati said. The BSP has been supporting UPA nominee Meira Kumar, who, significantly, had recently termed identification of two Presidential candidates by their caste as “unfortunate”.
 
 Mayawati’s statement came amid reports of cross-voting by some BSP MLAs in favour of Kovind. The Samjawadi Party was already a divided house after SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav and his brother Shivpal Yadav came in open support of the NDA-backed candidate. “There was no whip from the party leadership and so MLAs and MPs of various parties must have voted by their conscience...one may therefore should not be surprised if cross-voting happened,” said BJP UP general secretary, Vijay Bhadaur Pathak.
 
 BSP deputy legislative party leader, Uma Shankar Singh, however, ruled out the possibility of cross-voting by party MLAs. “All party MLAs were united in their choice of Meira Kumar,” he said while speaking to TOI. The 19 BSP MLAs cast their vote in UP assembly Tilak Hall around 11.15 am. Before casting their vote, the BSP MLAs also met Congress’s observer and former Lok Sabha MP Shakeel Ahmad and assured him of their support for the UPA nominee.
