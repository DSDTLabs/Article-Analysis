NOIDA: The   department will remain closed for a week from February 19 as the much-delayed   software, which aims to enable people to apply online for a driving  , will start from February 26.

 As the software needs to be updated with the latest version, officials said no new application would be accepted from February 19-25.
 
 A team from the Lucknow centre of the National Informatics Centre (NIC) will visit the department on February 20 for upgrading the software of the transport department. But the ARTO office in Sector 33 will remain closed on Monday too.
 
 “We have to transfer some of our data and cannot take the risk with new applications,” ARTO (administration) Arunendra Pandey said.
 
 With the new software, the applicants can book a time slot for the written test and submit all their documents online.
 
 The Sarathi 4.0 and Vahan 4.0 were expected to be launched in September 2017 but the process was delayed in the Ghaziabad region because of some technical snag in BSNL’s Internet connection.
 
 While Vahan 4.0 was launched in November last year, it was decided that Sarathi 4.0 will be launched after some time. The software will help people apply online for a licence. Earlier, an applicant had to go through a tedious process to apply for a licence.
