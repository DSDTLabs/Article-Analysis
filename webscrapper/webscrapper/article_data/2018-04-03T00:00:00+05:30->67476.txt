Director   says that his film,   — which deals with the psychology of people in a metro like Bengaluru — fits the avant garde category. And the four   of the movie reflect this  .

 Telling us more about this, Umesh says, “The posters are all coded. One depicts vertigo; the other shows a man who is running; then there is one that is red, with no images on it; the last features  , but his one eye is replaced with a window, within which there is only darkness. Each poster speaks of the theme of Varthamana and helps decode the film.”
