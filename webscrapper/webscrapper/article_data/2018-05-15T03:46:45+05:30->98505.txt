MUMBAI: Chief minister   on Monday observed that  's political head does not survive for a long period. 

  Fadnavis made the unexpected statement at the inauguration of a super-speciality hospital in Vikhroli. "It is a coincidence. I laid the foundation stone for the hospital three years ago and I am inaugurating it. It appears that either the hospital was constructed in a record time or I survived for a long period as chief minister. In Maharashtra, CMs do not survive for long,'' Fadnavis said. 
 
  The CM's observations assume significance in view of the ongoing political situation in Maharashtra. The   has successfully cornered the BJP in the crucial by-election for the Palghar Lok Sabha constituency. Despite his best efforts, the Shiv Sena did not oblige Fadnavis, hence there will be a straight contest between BJP nominee   and Shiv Sena candidate  , who was expected to be BJP candidate. In the recent past, the Sena did not miss a single opportunity to embarrass Fadnavis. 
 
 Vasantrao Naik was the Maharashtra CM for a record 11 years. Sharad Pawar had created a record, but it was surpassed by Vilasrao Deshmukh. Pawar had been the CM at different points in the 70s, 80s and 90s. Fadnavis took over the reins on October 31, 2014, and is all set to complete his five-year term. He will complete four years in office on October 31, 2018.
