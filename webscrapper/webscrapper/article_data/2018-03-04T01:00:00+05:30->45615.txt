Playback singer  , who is known for her tracks in films like Vicky Donor, Befikre, Ki & Ka, Golmaal Again and  , among others, was recently in   to perform at a college fest. The singer spoke to us about her experience of performing for Bareilly crowd, Sridevi’s death, digital media’s potential and more.
 
 Aditi says, "I visited Bareilly long ago; I’d come to perform at a concert along with playback singer,  . This time, I felt that I could connect well with the younger crowd of Bareilly, who sang, danced and grooved along. It was a great moment when I sang   and the college youngsters went crazy and started dancing with their mobiles’ flashlights on."
 
 
  
 
 
 The singer tells us, "As soon as I reached Bareilly, I was welcomed with a big bouquet of flowers and till the time I left the city, I kept receiving beautiful flowers from fans. Mujhe yahan aate hi itne phool mile ki main phoolon ki ek dukaan laga sakti hun; it was indeed a fantastic gesture. I believe, receiving flowers brings out the best moods in all of us, and that’s exactly what Bareillywallahs did!" 
 
 Aditi, who is quite active on social media, said, "I'm blessed to have been able to sing so many mainstream Bollywood songs, and each time a song is about to release or has released, I get a lot of love on social media. I am active online, as I like to stay in touch with my listeners. Digital media is a great platform to get noticed. There have been so many successful singers, who got noticed because of their YouTube videos. The best part about being active online is that people keep sharing good music and videos and one also gets to read comments and reactions to one’s work. I feel it is a great platform to get rewarded for your work."
