MUMBAI: Nine years of hits and misses, mighty successes and glaring failures, the   commenced their 10th edition this Thursday on a losing note. It wasn't really a setback for a side that once lost five opening matches in a row before coming back to win the title in 2015. It's become a kind of an inside joke that Mumbai take their own sweet time warming up.

 On Sunday, they'll take on Kolkata Knight Riders at home, in what is scheduled to be the first match at the Wankhede Stadium this season. Other than the fact that beating the in-form Knights could do a great deal to their confidence levels this early in the tournament, what's really keeping Mumbai busy right now is setting their own team priorities and objectives in place.
 
 It is that kind of prioritizing that perhaps saw the two-time champions drop seasoned off-spinner and their former captain Harbhajan Singh from the playing eleven in the match against Rising Pune Supergiant two days ago. Coach Mahela Jayawardene did mention on the eve of the game that Harbhajan, like everyone else, would be available for selection. The bowler also spent a good deal of time training at the nets on Saturday evening. Barring the debate on the off-spinner's place in the starting eleven, the crux of the remaining   squad is finally coming together. Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga, along with batsmen Asela Gunaratne, will be available for selection and that will give MI the opportunity to contemplate opening their attack with Malinga and Mitchell Johnson. 
 
 
 Rohit Sharma (captain), Parthiv Patel (wicketkeeper), Jos Buttler, Ambati Rayudu, Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Nitish Rana, Mitchell McClenaghan, Jasprit Bumrah, Lasith Malinga.
 
 
  (captain), Chris Lynn, Robin Uthappa (wicketkeeper), Manish Pandey, Yusuf Pathan, Suryakumar Yadav, Chris Woakes, Piyush Chawla, Kuldeep Yadav, Sunil Narine, Trent Boult.
