Vadodara: Three residents of Anand were arrested for allegedly assaulting a traffic constable at Dandiya Bazaar junction near old Shantadevi Hospital on Saturday night.

 The trio identified as Bharat Patel, Jignesh Dholakia and Vedant Vyas were stopped by Natwar Kabhai, a traffic cop manning the junction, for jumping the red light. Kabhai issued a memo of Rs 400 to Patel, who was driving the car, for jumping the red light and over-speeding. Meanwhile, the other two accused came out of the car and refused to pay the fine. Vyas then allegedly held the cop’s collars and tore his shirt’s button and broke his nameplate.

Another traffic cop who was present there, then tried to intervene following which they paid the fine. Later, Kabhai gave his complaint against them at Raopura police station on the basis of which all three of them were arrested for assaulting and deterring a public servant from performing his duties.
