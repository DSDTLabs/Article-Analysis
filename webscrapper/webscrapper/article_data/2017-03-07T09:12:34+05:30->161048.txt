PALANPUR: Child Malnutrition Treatment Center (CMTC) Palanpur and 16 other such centres in   will give toys to children coming there from March 8.

 “The toys will help in   of the children. This is for the first time that a CMTC is taking such an initiative,” said Rashmi Hada, convener,   (MKNTK), that has conceptualised the project.
 
 “When I told about providing toys to CMTC,donors at once responded positively. Mumbai-based business man Dr Vikram Mehta and his friends welcomed it and pursued others to come forward to set up a Toy Banks at CMTC,” she said.
 
 Bharat Bhil (3) from Danta, who is among the 10 children in the CMTC in Palanpur, held on tightly to the toy proudly, while Ashwinji Thakor (3) from Deesa stopped crying as soon as he received a toy.
 
 Hada says the idea of setting up toy banks came to her mind when a child caught her key chain and began playing with it. She thought the child was craving for a toy and put the idea to practice.
 
 “We are going to distribute toys at 13 centres including Deodar, Shihori, Dhanera, Danta, Amirgadh, Panthawadfa, Bhabhar, Thara, Suigam, Thrad, Vav, Lakhani besides Palanpur, which was launched on Thursday at Civil hospital. All remaining 12 centres will be provided with toys,” said programme associate Nutrition Taslim Umatiya.
 
 District Development Officer Amit Arora said, “Those severely acute malnourished children are kept at CMTC. All 17 centres will be given the toys for mental development of the children.
