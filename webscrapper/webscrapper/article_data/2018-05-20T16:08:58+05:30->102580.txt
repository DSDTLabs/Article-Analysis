Vahu Hi-fi ne sasu Wi-fi a play will be staged in the city today (May 20). The play will be staged at Thakorbhai Desai   from 9.30 pm onwards. The play written by Imtiaz Patel revolves around the life of Lalita Jobliya who lives with her two sons and daughters-in-law. Lalita manages the home on limited income of her sons, however the daughters-in-laws are not satisfied with their mother-in-lawâ€™s restricted budget. 

  The mother-in-law challenges the daughters-in-law to run the house as smoothly as she has on limited budget and if they win promises to leave Mumbai forever. The play is a laughter riot of what happens when the daughters-in-law take over the house.
