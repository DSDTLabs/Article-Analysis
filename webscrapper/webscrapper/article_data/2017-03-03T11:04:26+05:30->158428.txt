GUWAHATI: The state government on Thursday tabled a bill proposing the merger of   with the   (CCSU) into a new entity, the Cotton University, here. The historic college, set up in 1901, will give away all its assets, funds and other properties to the  , according to the   Bill, 2017, tabled in the house by education minister Himanta Biswa Sarma. 

 CCSU was set up six years ago as a separate institution. "During the course of the functioning of the CCSU, several conflicting issues have cropped up during the last four or five years of its existence. The issues are related to both academic and administrative affairs," Sarma said in the statement of the bill.
 
 Besides, "fundamental issues" need to be sorted out, the minister added, to make CCSU a leading university of the country. "Keeping in view the above background, the government in the higher education department desires to introduce this bill for the merger of Cotton College and CCSU," Sarma said in the bill.
 
 There has been ongoing conflict over the status of the teaching staff of Cotton College, some of who wanted to be moved to the varsity automatically. The new bill, however, proposes a proper selection process for recruitment of faculty. It does propose that all posts, including vacant ones, be transferred immediately to Cotton University with effect from the state of commencement of the Act. The bill proposed that higher secondary classes, pillars of Cotton College's glory, will remain an integral part of the varsity.
