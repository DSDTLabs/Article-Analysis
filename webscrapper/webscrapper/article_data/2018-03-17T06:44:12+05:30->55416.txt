HYDERABAD: A 23-year-old vendor was beaten to death by four men, after he crashed his bike into their vehicle in a drunken state at Krishna Nagar on Friday. The victim  , a resident of   in Moosapet, used to sell snacks to shops in Krishna Nagar and neighbouring areas.

 On Thursday night, Sudhir and his friend Dhanraj, a sweet shop owner, consumed alcohol. At around 12.45am, the duo went to a liquor shop in Yousufguda to buy more alcohol but they had no money. Sudhir left   near the liquor shop and started riding towards Krishna Nagar on wrong direction. “Sudhir rammed into two bikes coming from Venkatgiri. Instead of apologising, he abused the riders,” Jubilee Hills inspector P Chandra   said.
 
 The four men started punching and kicking Sudhir. Dhanraj saw them from a distance and rushed to Sudhir’s rescue. The men slapped Dhanraj also. Sudhir fell unconscious and passersby alerted cops. Cops shifted Sudhir to a hospital. “Sudhir was declared brought dead,” Sekhar said. The accused — Sushil, Sk Jamal, Anoop and   — were held.
