Singer   has appointed his crew to ensure there's always a bottle of tomato ketchup on hand wherever he goes.

 "Ed's made no secret of his   obsession and has run out of patience with going to places that don't serve it while he is touring. He has made it a duty of key members of his entourage to carry a bottle wherever he goes so he can have it with everything from his morning sausage butty to upmarket dinners," a source told thesun.co.uk.
 
 Just last month, the 26-year-old singer said that he would make ketchup "compulsory in all places" alongside fries if he was ever elected as  's Prime Minister, and he would ban early mornings.
 
 Sharing a headline from a news article on  , which claimed that young people in Britain had voted for him to take the place of current leader  , he captioned the image: "I can't even think of a caption for this let alone run the country, but I would make 5 a.m. illegal and ketchup compulsory in all places with chips."
