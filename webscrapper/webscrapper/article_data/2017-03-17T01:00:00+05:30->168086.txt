 The pop star, known for writing the lyrics of not just his own songs but also of other artistes in the past, has really gone all-out while the lyrics of this album. A mix of melancholia, love and irreverence in equal parts, 'Divide' is mainly Sheeran having fun, although the melancholia bits are the weakest links.
