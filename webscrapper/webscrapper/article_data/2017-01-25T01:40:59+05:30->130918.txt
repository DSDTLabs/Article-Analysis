MUMBAI: A 51-year-old widow has been booked by the   for allegedly torturing and harassing her 12-year-old   to do household chores. The boy’s plight came to light after Pratham NGO approached the Child Welfare Committee, which, in turn, urged it to file a complaint. 

 “The woman would make the boy wash utensils and clothes and mop the floor and if he refused, she would scald him or set the pet dog on him,” said a police officer. The couple had legally adopted the boy from a Pune centre in 2014. The woman’s husband had died last year.
