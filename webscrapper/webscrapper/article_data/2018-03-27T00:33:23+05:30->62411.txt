Salem: A few days after fish died en masse in River Cauvery near Mettur, fishermen around the area have started to dry those dead fish for sale before knowing the cause of the death.

 This comes even after the same fishermen suspected the death might be due to pollution caused by industrial effluent. 
 
 On Saturday morning, fishermen spotted several varieties of fish found dead in the river at Madaiyankuttai area near Mettur. 
 
 Suspecting that untreated effluent from nearby industries as the cause, the villagers informed the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials and asked them to check the purity of water. “We were shocked as the water turned green and foul smell started emnating from it,” said a villager. 
 
 A team of officials from TNPCB, Salem, collected samples from the spot in the same evening. “The oxygen level might have dropped due to evaporation or the water might have been contaminated due to algae. We could ascertain the cause only after further tests of samples,” said a TNPCB official. 
 
 Meanwhile, the local fishermen started drying the dead fishes for sales. Health officials warned consumption of dead fish could lead to some health issues. “We don’t know the actual reason for the death. It might harm our health. People should avoid consuming these fish,” said S Sujatha, a general physician.
