 One of our favourite styles is the classic button-up shirt. It's versatile, airy and just so cozy. Wondering how to make this dude item dressy and stylish? We're taking a cue from  , who may have borrowed a shirt from her boyfriend (hint:  ) for her recent look.

 Here's how she styled it: 
 
 - She kept the first two-three buttons open, giving the collar a relaxed and casual touch.
 - She didn't roll up the sleeves but kept the buttons open again, keeping it casual. 
 - Giving a polished look to the shirt, she styled the look with skinny ripped jeans, black boots and a luxe handbag.
 - She kept her look simple and relaxed and went for a nude lip colour, messy bun hairdo and a pair of round sunnies.
