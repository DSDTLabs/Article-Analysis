TRICHY: Yet another case of an elderly woman being conned by persons pretending to be policemen was recorded in   on Monday. A 64-year-old woman fell prey to a trick played out by a couple of men and lost her four-sovereign   chain, at   in Trichy. 

 Police said V Rajalakshmi, 64, of   in Srirangam, was walking home after visiting a shop on Monday afternoon when two men approached her and introduced themselves as plain-clothes police. The duo told   that they were on duty in the area to nab chain snatchers and advised her to remove the gold chain she was wearing and keep it in the bag. 
 
 Accordingly, the woman removed the four-sovereign chain. The duo wrapped it in a piece of paper and handed it over to her. They warned her to take the ornament out only after reaching home, and left. Heaving a sigh of relief, Rajalakshmi too continued her journey towards home. 
 
 However, on reaching home the woman found only a few pebbles wrapped in the paper. It was then Rajalakshmi realised that she had been taken for a ride. She lodged a complaint with Srirangam police station (crime). Based on her complaint, the police registered a case and conducted preliminary investigation.
 
 Police said that the woman was unaware if she had been administered any chemical substance by the duo to act according to their instructions.
 
 Several cases with similar modus operandi have been reported at Cantonment, TVS toll gate and a few other areas in the city in the past one year. Despite this, the police have failed to nab the miscreants.
