Singer   is in a happy space these days because her song, Ottha Paarvayil, for the film Kadamban is getting good reviews from fans. “It’s a folk melody written by   and my first duet with Yuvan Shankar Raja. Ever since it was launched on March 24, I’ve been getting good feedback from music fans,” says the singer, who had sung in Iru Mugan and Dharmadurai last year.

 Interestingly, she has also released her own independent music video recently, on March 21. She calls that song,  , a “bhakti trance number”. “I’ve always been fascinated by thillanas. They are unqiue to our south Indian culture and I wanted to take thillanas to the masses. So, I adapted thillanas in ragas Madhuvanti and   and presented them in a contemporary fashion,” says Srimathumitha, adding that her team shot the video of the song at the Arupadai Veedu temple in Besant Nagar in just a day. “Since thillanas are integral to Bharatanatyam, we roped in students of danseuse Srekala Bharath for this video,” she says.
