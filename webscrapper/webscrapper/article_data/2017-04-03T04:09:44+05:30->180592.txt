NEW DELHI: Unscrupulous people trying to beat airport security and flying with things they are not allowed to take on planes are getting increasingly innovative.

 The most recent attempt of hoodwinking security took place at   on Sunday. Two flyers supposed to fly from there to Chennai via Kolkata on IndiGo entered the airport with   allegedly hidden inside their clothes. Once inside the terminal, they got their check-in bags Xrayed. They then transferred the gold into the bags without breaking the security checked seals or zip locks.
 
 Howeverspending a long time in the toilet to do so aroused suspicion of airline staff. “While conducting physical search of the baggages, gold coated with silver was detected. We asked the passengers to scratch the items. The outer coating came off, revealing the yellow shiny metal. Over 1.7 kg gold was eventually found,” said an Indi-Go spokesman.
 
 The passengers were handed over to the police. Sources say this case may be another instance of gold smuggling from Myanmar to India. “It was a combined effort from all departments, local CID and our staffers K Nganba and Kikim Singson,” the airline said.
