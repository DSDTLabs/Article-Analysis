PUNE: With the curricula for standards VII and IX of the state board set for a makeover, teachers would get a chance to show their creative talent.

  would now include one-act plays written by teachers from government schools to create a liking for this art form among students. The plays would be accepted in Marathi, Hindi and English.
 
 Last year, Balbharati had included in its Std VI textbook, a poem written by a girl of the same standard,  , from the Central higher primary Marathi school in Kapra taluka of Yavatmal district. The Maharashtra State Council of Education Research and Training ( ) had invited poems written by students for publication and Sonali's poem titled ‘Jhaad’ (Tree) was selected.
 
 In a similar initiative, teachers have now been asked to send their creative writings to the MSCERT. Balbharati director   said, “Teachers are actively involved in introducing innovative teaching methods and many schools replicate the ideas. We are now giving them an opportunity to have their works published in the textbooks so that it gets recognition and appreciation from students.”
 
 Each teacher can submit a maximum of three one act plays in any of the languages.
 
 Magar added, “We will scrutinise the plays for quality and viability to include in the textbooks and if we do not receive a play that is not good enough to be included in textbooks, Balbharati shall drop the idea completely.”
 
 Sachin Bhagwat, a secondary teacher said, “This initiative will surely encourage the teachers because there is no greater joy than seeing your own work published in textbooks. It will motivate many teachers who do not pen their thoughts.” Bhagwat said Sonali’s poem had motivated other students to start creative writing. Many schools put up the best poems on the notice board every month.
