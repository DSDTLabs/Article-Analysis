MEERUT: In a first, 450 gram panchayats of the district have purchased   after instructions were given by health authorities to distribute these in a bid to check vector-borne diseases. Authorities said the move was being taken so that steps taken to control diseases are employed regularly in the rural areas when malaria officials fail to reach villages due to various reasons. In the urban areas, meanwhile, ‘mohalla committees’ have been formed to set up health camps and administer anti-larva sprays in localities.
 
  Dr KP Singh, assistant chief medical officer, said, “Every year, mosquito-borne diseases and cases of fever rise because regular fogging and anti-larva spraying in the entire district does not take place due to lack of adequate staff. Keeping this in mind, each of the 450 gram panchayats were instructed to purchase anti-larva spray machines. They will get the medicine that is to be sprayed from the district malaria office. They will also ensure that spraying is done at least once every week.”
  
  It should be noted that the responsibility of anti-larva spraying has been given to   in each gram panchayat – which is given Rs 10,000 yearly from the district health department for the task. “One such machine costs Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,000. It is a one-time investment and each machine will last for a long period of time,” added Singh.
  
  “Since we have a shortage of staff this initiative will help us and also ensure that mosquito-borne diseases are checked,” said  , district malaria officer.
