PUNE: A pre-poll alliance pact between the Nationalist   ( ) and the Congress was not finalized even on Saturday.

 However, both parties remained positive about an alliance, despite there being no breakthrough even after several rounds of negotiations. 
 
 On Saturday, NCP leader   said he was hopeful of a breakthrough by Sunday. “We are still discussing seat-sharing,” he said, adding that they were 80% there. 
 
 While stating that he expects a positive outcome in a day or two, Pawar did not rule out going it alone. 
 
 “The party is ready to contest alone if things fail to work as per expectations,” Pawar said.
 
 The logjam was caused when the Congress asked for additional seats, a demand the NCP has not consented to. 
 
 “There are some pockets in the city where the Congress has a strong hold. We will ensure they gets more seats in those areas. NCP wants to join hands with secular parties to battle those fighting polls on religious grounds.”
 
 Meanwhile, Pawar expects the   to benefit from the break-up with the   (BJP), as the Sena did not benefit from the 25-year-old alliance. 
 
 Pawar slams BJP over Development Plan
 
 For the first time, Pawar publicly criticized the recently-announced Development Plan (DP). “The DP is not to Pune’s advantage. The BJP-led state government did not have a comprehensive outlook while finalizing it. How will the government going to deal with issues like water availability, drainage and road infrastructure due to the additional FSI?” Pawar said.
