VISAKHAPATNAM: Acharya Balkrishna, a close aide and major stake holder of Baba Ramdev’s  , said plans to expand their market network to 5 lakh retail outlets across the country are underway. On Saturday, Balkrishna entered into an agreement with the AP government to invest Rs 1,000 crore to develop a food park in   district.

 “We are searching for educated youth who can open our store in their area but they must have full confidence on Ayurveda and should spread the message of this great Indian tradition,” Balkrishna told TOI on the sidelines of the Partnership Summit.
 
 The 44-year old Ayurveda scholar and billionaire is very eager to invest in both AP and Telangana as the response to the products from these states are ‘very encouraging’. The production capacity of more than 100 Ayurveda products including fast moving ones like honey, beauty products and health drinks are to be augmented.
 
 “There is no shortage of demand for our products but we have to step up our production capacity for which we are planning to set up more units across the country. Many southern states have invited us to set up plants,” said Balkrishna. He also expressed the group’s interest in entering tourism projects to develop yoga centres, health clinics and naturopathy centres. “Let the government offer good piece of land, I am ready to enter into health tourism,” said Balkrishna.
 
 When asked about the total turnover of Patanjali Ayurved, Balkrishna did not specify a figure but said it will soon cross Rs 10,000 crore. The group presently had 5,000 distributors and has tied up with major retail chains to sell more than 100 products.
