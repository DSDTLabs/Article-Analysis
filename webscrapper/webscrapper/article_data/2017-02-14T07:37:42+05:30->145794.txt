RAJKOT: In the first case of a nearly extinct bird species being reintroduced after successful captive breeding, the state forest department is all set to release red jungle fowls in Jessore Sloth Bear Sanctuary in   very soon. 

 The bird is almost extinct locally or very rarely spotted. However, the species was successfully bred in captivity in Junagadh's   after being brought from Haryana. 
 
 "We had got 10 red jungle fowls - four males and six females - to   in December 2015. The breeding started in few months and 12 birds were born in total," A P Singh, chief conservator of forests, Junagadh (wildlife), told TOI.
 
 Jessore sanctuary has been identified to release these birds as they were found in northern Gujarat in the past in significant numbers. However, this species is almost locally extinct in the area or rarely spotted. 
 
 Ornithologist   said, "Efforts are being made globally to reintroduce the species which is either extinct locally or has become rare. If the local species is being reintroduced into the wild where it was once found, it is a welcome move.   is rarely spotted in the state's bordering areas with Madhya Pradesh. However, there are historical records of these birds seen in northern and eastern parts of the state."
 
 Around four decades ago, efforts were made to breed the rare hornbill in Girnar. However, the efforts were not successful.
 
 However, sources said that there has been no official census of this bird or exact details about its status and distribution in the state. This information and data is critical for conservation of any species.
 
 "The jungle fowls will initially be kept in captivity in Jessore sanctuary and bred there. Later, they will be released in the wild. These birds are easy prey for animals like wolves and are part of an important food chain," said S J Pandit, director at Sakkarbaug Zoological Park.
