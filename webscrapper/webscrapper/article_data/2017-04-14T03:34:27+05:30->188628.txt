KOLKATA: The   retains the Contai (South) bypoll securing around 56% of the votes, but the story unfolds from the result is not as much as the ruling party’s victory as the BJP growing consolidation at the cost of the Left. The Left Front could only manage around 10% of the votes compared to the BJP’s 31%.

 A comparison of vote shares of the 2016 assembly elections and the bypoll shows that the erosion of the Left vote share (24%) is almost equal to the increase in the BJP’s vote share (22%). Significantly, this happened in less than a year. 
 
 The voting pattern in this East Midnapore constituency sends out three unmistakable signals, two of which may indicate a directional change in Bengal politics. 
 
 The first is not much of a change; the Trinamool has increased both its vote share and its margin of victory, indicating there is no dent in its rural and semi-urban support. But the other two signal a possible tectonic change in how Bengal votes: the BJP is emerging as the go-to party for opposition voters, and is elbowing out the Left and the Congress, both of whom lost their deposits in the bypoll.
