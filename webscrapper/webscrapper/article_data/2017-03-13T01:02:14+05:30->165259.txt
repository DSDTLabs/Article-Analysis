GURUGRAM: Carrying placards and shouting slogans, over 70 residents of A Block in   staged a   in the area on Sunday, alleging that a gate installed by a neighbouring society has destroyed the nearby  .

 “We feel cheated by the authorities and the management, since they did not consider the hardship faced by residents. By opening this gate, the lane has been exposed to criminal activities. What is the need of one more gate when the complex already had four?” asked Kanu, a resident of the area. 
 
 In 2011, a dispute between residents and the builder led to the same gate being closed and a boundary wall being erected in its place. 
 
 “Six years ago, the grievance was redressed by closing the disputed gate and erecting a boundary wall, as an RTI application revealed that no gate was sanctioned in the initial plan. However, the wall was suddenly brought down now by the management and the gate installed. Security of residents is at risk. We therefore demand permanent closure of the gate,” said D V Sethi, a resident of A Block,   1.
 
 “We had made a nice green belt in the area and also put up swings for children. A part of the green belt has now been destroyed by the management of the complex,” Sethi added.
