CHENNAI: The boundaries of Chennai district are likely to be officially redrawn on April 1. Though the state government has added six more   to Chennai district from the neighbouring Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts, the taluks are currently in the administrative control of their respective districts.

 Government sources said formalities such as preference of the revenue department personnel on choosing their districts need to be finalised. “Such procedures consume some time. We are expecting the government order on re-organising Chennai district to take effect from April 1,” an official privy to developments told TOI. The borders of the city would be officially redrawn on April 1, expanding its size from 176sqkm to 426sqkm.
 
 Nearly a fortnight ago, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami had launched the expansion programme, including the addition of six new taluks such as Alandur and Sholinganallur in Kancheepuram district and  , Madavaram, Maduravoyal and Tiruvottiyur taluks in Tiruvallur district. The expanded area will now have 122 revenue villages including 67 newly added revenue villages from the two districts. While the population in Chennai district was 4.6 million as per the census in 2011, the total population in the expanded district would be about 7.1 million. 
 
 According to Chennai district collector V Anbuselvan, the revenue officials employed in the six taluks of the two districts can pick the district of their choice. “Options would be given to the employees to either work in Chennai district or continue to be part of their respective districts (Kancheepuram or Tiruvallur),” he said. “Moreover, the expansion would ease coordination between police, Metrowater, corporation and the district collector. For instance, the Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner will not have to contact three district collectors, as areas falling under the civic body in these districts would be part of the extended Chennai district,” he added.
