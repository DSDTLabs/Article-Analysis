GHAZIABAD: One of the main concerns of commuters who took the   on Friday following its inauguration was speeding. 

 There is fear that if the new flyover is not policed properly, it could lead to accidents caused by unruly driving. Commuters are also wary of wrong-side driving, which is common on   roads. There were no traffic guards in sight on Friday. Cars were also seen moving in the wrong direction. “A speed limit of 70 kmph should be made mandatory for all commuters. This should be monitored by traffic cops present at the start and end points besides patrolling vehicles permanently stationed on the flyway,” said Rakesh Kumar (42), a resident of Raj Nagar Extension.
 
 Several commuters suggested there should be more signage boards along the flyway bearing helpline numbers. “Heights of the barricades on either sides of the flyway should be increased in order to avoid any vehicle from plunging down (into the Hindon canal) after toppling over,” said Mohit Dhanwan (35).
 
 Ghaziabad traffic police said it will be impossible to monitor speed limits as they have only one 24X7 interceptor SUV at their disposal that cannot be dedicated to the flyway for 24X7 service.
 
 “Speed radars need to be installed on barricades. It needs to be figured out as to what measures can be taken to prevent speeding . We are alert about the issue and PCR vans along with traffic patrol motorbikes will be deployed soon. The ramps at Indirapuram and   will witness maximum traffic during peak hours. One-way vehicular movement will soon be enforced near the Kanawani ramp,” SP (traffic)   told TOI.
