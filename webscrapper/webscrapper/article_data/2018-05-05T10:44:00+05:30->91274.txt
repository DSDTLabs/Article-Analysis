CHANDIGARH:   (religion publicity)   of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( ) on Friday held a meeting and condemned changes by the   (PSEB), like deleting various Sikh chapters in the new history book for class 12.

 SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said the Dharam Parchar Committee would convene another meeting on the issue on May 7 in Amritsar. The committee members raised the demand to immediately withdraw the government’s decision of introducing a new history book, and instead continue with the previous one. The Dharam Parchar Committee has also decided that according to the Nanakshahi calendar, Gurta Gaddi (installation of Guruship) Divas of Guru Har Gobind Singh — which was falling on May 8 — will now be celebrated on June 7.
 
 According to committee members, the history of Gurus is an integral part of Punjab, and if this history is removed from school books, nothing in those books will survive. They said the sacrifices and contributions of the Sikh community to save Indian culture can never be forgotten. Committee members said that even during the country's independence, more than 80% of the sacrifices were made by Sikhs. In ignoring all these facts, the   government has done a lot of injustice against the Khalsa by ending the history of the Sikh community, and the contribution made by them to the country.
