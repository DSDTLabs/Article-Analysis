BENGALURU: The   on Monday disposed of a petition while declining to issue a direction to the   to use a helicopter to drop flowers on the petitioner's new house in   of Varthur Hobli,   on February 9. 

 Justice A S Bopanna said it would be setting a wrong precedent if the request is acceded to by the court in the absence of any legal right and solely on the ground that a neighbour (Manohar) had been granted permission in February last year.
 
 The judge noted that the use of helicopter is not a ritual/custom (as per the shastras) just like the custom of making a cow enter a newly built house.
 
 The court was told that police considered the petitioner's representation and rejected it after noting that permitting the use of a helicopter would harm houses with asbestos roofs in the neighbourhood and could even lead to a law and order problem.
 
 Counsel for the petitioner argued that the petitioner 's neighbour had been granted police permission for a similar exercies and a public authority cannot discriminate in this manner. He also blamed police for labelling him a rowdy-sheeter and also cajoling neighbours to speak against him.
 
 Claiming that the exercise is only for a few minutes and that the helicopter would fly 200 metres above the ground and no harm will be done to nearby houses, the counsel said the petitioner would compensate for damages, if any, to neighbours's houses.
 
 Apart from claiming equity on a par with his neighbour who had been granted permission, the petitioner claimed he had distributed invitations to friends, relatives and well-wishers. He said if the programme was stopped, he'd be subjected to disparaging comments during the housewarming ceremony.
