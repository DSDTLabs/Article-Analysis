CHENNAI: Socrates never believed in the written word. The Greek philosopher held that the spoken word was alive and true but the written word was as good as dead.   winner and folklorist   went against Socrates' 'dictum', succesfully capturing life in the scorched, drought-stricken land around Kovilpatti, or 'karisal kaadu'. 

 Five books penned by the 94-year old writer, popular among fans as Ki Ra, were released at a function at the Chennai Book Fair on Friday. Addressing Ki Ra fans at the launch, poet   said Ki Ra gave life to the written word. "He used literature as a tool to immortalise the life and times of the karisal kaadu and took it to future generations." She compared his works 'Gopalla Gramam' and ' ' to 'The Good Earth' (1931), the Noble prize-winning book by American writer Pearl S Buck.
 
 K S Radhakrishnan, DMK member and advocate who presided over the launch, and others invoked the long-pending demand for the 'Jnanpith Award' to be given to the nonagenarian author. Radhakrishnan said, "We had high expectations that Ki Ra would be bestowed the honour this year. It has been 12 years since a Tamil writer won the award. Ki Ra barely went to school, but rose through hard work and learned literature on his own." Tamil writers Jayakanthan and P V Akilan are previous recipients of the award.
 
 Senior   of India leader R Nallakannu recalled that Ki Ra's short story 'Kadavu' (door) led to a political movement in the 1960s. "Ki Ra based the story on one of our struggles. After a farmer's bull had been seized for deferring payments, we protested that a farm bull could not be seized. The famer's house door was also seized. We ensured they were reclaimed." The 92-year old leader said CPI candidate S Alagarsamy went on to contest and win five elections between 1967 and 1991 based on the issue. Ki Ra retired as professor of folklore at Pondicherry central university in 2002 after serving for 12 years.
