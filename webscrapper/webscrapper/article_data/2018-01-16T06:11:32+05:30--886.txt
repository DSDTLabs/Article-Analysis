As younger fishermen huddled around their boats in  , 64-year-old V   puffed at a beedi, looking worried. On Tuesday, another layer of garbage will rob a little more of the sand beneath his feet.

 “They are happy because they can make some money out of tourists,” said Victor, looking in the direction of the fishermen who were gearing to ferry tourists illegally. Like on every other holiday, Pulicat is likely to bristle with tourists on Kaanum Pongal. Older fishermen like Victor who have lived here all their lives recall seeing it in all its pristine beauty. “Tourists started coming here 15 years ago. And there’s close to that many years of uncleared garbage on our islands,” said Victor.
 
 A month ago, a students’ group collected nearly 400kg of solid waste from the Irukkam island. But   D, general secretary of Tiruvallur District Union of Traditional Fishermen’s Association, said it was a one-off initiative. “We have to wait for more than a year for the next group of volunteers to come,” he said. Locals say the block-level officer of  , 25km away from Pulicat, sometimes deputes a team for cursory cleaning operations.
 
 Pulicat lake has 17 endemic species including red crabs and prawns, many of which are slowly disappearing. “This is robbing us of our livelihood,” said Victor.
 
 Xavier Benedict, an architect who undertakes heritage walks around the lake, said there has been a sharp rise in tourists visiting the islands. He anticipates at least 30,000 visitors to Pulicat on Tuesday. “National institutes have studied the extent of pollution here caused by irresponsible tourism, but no one has done anything about it,” he said. Officials in the ministry of environment, forest and climate change said a joint commissioner posted in Chennai will be visiting the ecologically sensitive wetland next week to assess the extent of pollution.
