AHMEDABAD: A three-year-old girl was run over by a car on   on Wednesday. The victim was a daughter of a construction labourer who was involved in repair works in the temple. Police have registered a case of accidental death against the driver of the car.

 Police sources said the a labourers from Rajasthan have been hired for construction and repair works on the temple premises. Among workers were, Pankaj Damor and his wife. “Because of the heat, the couple had made their three-year-old daughter   sleep on the slope of the basement parking slot, which is under a shade,” added a police source.
 
 Police officials claimed that around 12 noon a pilgrim came with his car in the temple. “He obviously did not notice the child sleeping on the slope of the basement parking and run over the baby. The cries of the baby attracted the attention of others present in the temple premises. However the driver of the car fled after abandoning his vehicle. The cops have seized the car and are searching for its owner,” said a police official. tnn
