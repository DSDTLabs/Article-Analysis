Registering their   in the city’s market region, traders shut shops and protested against the city   on Tuesday.

 “The   took steps to establish underground drainage pipelines under roads including Prakasam Road, Muthurangam Road, Annaji Road and Sivasanmugam Road. Even after one-and-a- half-year, the civic body did not bother to relay the roads,” a businessman said.
 
 Due to the poor condition of the roads, they had to fill up potholes on their own cost, traders said. “For many months, those coming to the market were affected due to dust pollution. Our customers had to cover their faces with masks. During the rainy seasons, the roads turn into mud pools. In fact, it has affected our business,” a trader in the market said.
 
 Despite various representations to the corporation officials, no steps were taken to relay the roads, they said. A few weeks ago, Erode east   had visited the market and promised a solution soon, they said.
 
 The traders also took out a procession and submitted a petition to corporation commissioner M Seeni Ajmalkhan.TNN
