PANAK: Taking a dig at BJP’s not so subtle hint that defence minister   will be leading the next government in Goa, irrespective of his posting,  , on Wednesday, said that current chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar should “abdicate from his post as he has lost the trust of his own party”. 

 “Parrikar has told everyone that he is indispensible and the present chief minister is good for nothing. This is an acknowledgement from the   that by installing Parsekar as the chief minister, they put in an incompetent person on the seat. Parsekar should abdicate from the seat as he has already lost the trust of his own senior leaders,” Congress leader Ramakant Khalap said, adding that Parsekar is finding it difficult to win in his own constituency this time. 
 
 The party also raised the issue of deputy chief minister Francis D’Souza not being promoted to the chief ministerial post, when Parrikar moved to Delhi. 
 
 “D’Souza, who hails from the minority community, had put in his claim for the chief minister’s post when Parrikar became the defence minister. D’Souza is a senior leader and minorities were promised that their interests will be looked after. D’Souza was sidelined and current statements by BJP show that minorities cannot expect justice from the party,” Khalap said.
