 “I want to thank Parrikar for allowing so many different projects in Goa. Initially, he had told me the state would build the bridge and the ring road on its own. But before he took ill, Parrikar came to me and said he was facing a financial crunch in Goa, and asked for aid. I immediately processed his request and today, I am happy to declare that the Centre has taken a decision to fund the new Mandovi bridge to the extent of Rs 400 crore,” Gadkari said.
 
 The Union minister further said the central government is spending around Rs 15,000 crore for various road and bridge projects in the state. “We are in the process of providing projects to Goa at an approximate cost of Rs 15,000 crore; a scale unlike anything the state has witnessed since its liberation,” Gadkari said.
