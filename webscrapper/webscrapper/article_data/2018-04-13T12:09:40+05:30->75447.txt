RAIPUR: In a major relief to the  ,   on Friday dismissed petitions challenging appointment and continuance of 11   but held that they cannot discharge the functions and responsibilities of ministers.

 The division bench of Chief Justice T B Radhakrishnan and Justice Sharad Kumar Gupta passed the order on petitions filed by former Congress minister Mohammad Akbar and a social worker and   activist Rakesh Choubey, who challenged their appointment on the ground that itâ€™s illegal and unconstitutional. A copy of the high court judgement is awaited.
 
 Initially the high court had completed its hearing on the petitions on March 16 and had reserved it for order. Later, the high court sought a clarification from the petitioner Mohammad Akbar and reserved its orders on February two.
 
 Earlier in an interim order in August last year, the high court had ordered to seize the powers of all parliamentary secretaries appointed by the state. The high court had then observed that if the parliamentary secretaries were not appointed by the Governor then they didn't have constitutional legitimacy and should not be allowed to work in that position. The court instructed to withdraw their powers and facilities.
 
 Chhattisgarh has 11 parliamentary secretaries who enjoy the status of ministers and are said to be assisting the ministers to perform their duties.
 
 The Parliamentary secretaries are Ambesh Jangade, Labchand Bafna, Lkahn Dewangan, Motiram Chandravanshi, Rook Kumari Choudhary, Shivshankar Paikra, Suniti Rathiya, Tokhan Sahu, Champa Pawle, Govardhan Singh Manji, Raju Khashtri.
