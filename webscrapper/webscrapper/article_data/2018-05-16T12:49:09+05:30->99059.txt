TRICHY: The BJP has claimed that the Union government will not remain a mere spectator in the   issue. It must have the authority to ask errant states to fall in line if they didn’t execute the orders of the Cauvery monitoring authority. The BJP-led Centre is working on these lines to implement the   order, said Union minister   on Tuesday.

 He was inaugurating a 24-day cycle rally across 24 assembly constituencies in the delta districts at Kallanai ( ), he explained the necessity of launching such a rally. He said that the opposition parties in   were accusing the Centre of using delaying tactics, without doing anything to constitute the Cauvery Management Board. The rally was organised to retrieve the rights of delta farmers and clear the air on false propaganda.
 
 “The rally will help expose the real colour of political parties, who have been constantly shedding crocodile tears and acting against the interest of Tamil Nadu farmers,” the minister said.
 
 When asked whether the BJP will participate in the all-party meeting convened by Makkal Needhi Mayyam leader Kamal Haasan, the minister said that the party would decide on that.
 
 The cycle rally concludes at Peravurani in Thanjavur on June 2. Various pujas were performed on the Cauvery riverbed praying for a good and early monsoon, both in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, so that farmers from the states would have enough water to execute agricultural activities, Pon Radhakrishnan said.
