NAGPUR: On a day when city shuttlers hogged the limelight at the State Junior Championship, another city teenager made her mark overseas and bagged a silver medal at the Lagos International Challenger   tournament at Lagos, Nigeria, on Saturday.

 The four-day tournament was organized by the Badminton Confederation of Africa.
 
 Fourth seed Mugdha’s brilliant run was halted in the final by a giant-killer Thilini Pramodika Hendahewa of Sri Lanka. The unseeded Lankan shattered the hopes of Mugdha by registering a 21-12, 21-19 victory in the women’s singles final.
 
 The 21-year-old Thilini caused several upsets on her way to clinch the title and also knocked out three Indians including Vaishnavi Jakka Reddy, Gummadi Vrushali and sixth seed Vaidehi Choudhari.
 
 Mugdha, who is ranked 184 in the world, fought hard, particularly in the second game, against the more experienced Lankan but could not capture her maiden international title.
 
 Eighteen-year-old Mugdha, who trains under Jibi Verghese, pocketed 1120 US dollars for her effort.
 
 The fast-rising city shuttler became only the third city player after   and   to reach the women’s singles final in an international tournament.
 
 A first year BA student of LAD College, Mugdha will now travel directly to play in the All India Junior Ranking Badminton tournament which will begin from Monday.
 
 The hard-working shuttler has been doing quite well on the state and national badminton circuit for the last couple of years. She is a elder daughter of Nitin and Bhavna Agrey.
