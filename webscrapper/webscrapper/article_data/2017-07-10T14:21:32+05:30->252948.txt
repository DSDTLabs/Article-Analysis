CHANDIGARH: There's some relief for the officers of Chandigarh administration, which has been reeling under an acute shortage of officers. A 2004-batch IAS officer is expected to join the administration by next week, sources in the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) have told TOI. 

 Sources said IAS officer  's request to the ministry to not post him to the city had been turned down. Once Sharma joins the city, there could be significant changes in charges given to officers in the administration. At present, almost every senior bureaucrat is holding multiple charges.
 
 The administration's woes had worsened in May, when three IAS officers - S B  , Tapasya Raghav and   - had been transferred out of the city. For now, Garg is still serving in the city, as she has been given an extension.
 
 Sources said Sharma was posted in the Delhi Subordinate   Board (SSSB) at present. "Since Deepak Kumar was holding crucial departments Sharma could be given major portfolios," said sources. "The presence of the new officer will surely reduce burden on present officers. Each one has been holding multiple charges of several departments, besides his or her original charge. Due to this, we are unable to devote enough time to crucial issues," said a senior UT official.
