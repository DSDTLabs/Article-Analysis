JALANDHAR: Punjab Congress president   on Monday said the RSS was anti-Sikh and asked SAD to explain its position for enjoying power in an RSS-controlled government when sections of Akalis were speaking against it.

 Jakhar was speaking to mediapersons here on Tuesday. “The RSS is anti-Sikh, anti-Punjab, anti-development and its ideology is going against the idea of India. They have been against minorities,” he said when asked that recently former Akali MLA and senior party leader Virsa Singh Valtoha had said that the RSS was anti-Sikh. “It is for the Akali Dal to explain that in Delhi they are partners in a government controlled by the RSS but here they claim to be champions of minorities and Sikhs,” Jakhar said.
 
 When told that SAD had been holding that its alliance was with the BJP only and it had nothing to do with the RSS, the Gurdaspur MP said they would not be able to fool the people for long. “On one hand Akali leaders and their affiliates term the RSS anti-Sikh while on the other they continue to be in alliance with them,” he maintained.
