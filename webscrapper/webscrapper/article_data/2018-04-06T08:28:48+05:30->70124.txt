This is the third notice that we have sent to the authority,” he said.
 
 The NHAI is engaged in four-laning and double-laning of the highway in Kullu district and thousands of tonnes of debris is being dumped in the Beas and forest land along the road.

 Dumping is still continuing between Manali and Patlikuhl. Chadha said the debris can be dumped only at marked sites. “Dumping in forest land is illegal. We are keeping a close watch on the ongoing works. If anything illegal is found, strict action would be taken. We have written to NHAI, to give in writing that this will not happen again,” he said.
