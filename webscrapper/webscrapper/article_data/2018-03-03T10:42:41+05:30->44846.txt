KRISHNAGIRI: A land dispute between siblings has allegedly claimed the lives of two pregnant  , which were poisoned to death, near   here on Friday.

 According to police, the cows belonged to M  , 45, of   near Shoolagiri. He used to tie the cows near a tank everyday so that they can quench their thirst. As usual he left the cows near the tank on Friday and when he returned after a while, found them unconscious.
 
 Sahadevan immediately took the cows to a nearby veterinary doctor, who declared them brought dead.
 
 When alerted, the Shoolagiri police initiated an inquiry with Sahadevan and his family members. The police then came to know that Sahadevan’s younger brother had personal enmity with him in connection with a property dispute.
 
 “We suspect that he might have laced poison in the water following the land dispute issue,” the Shoolagiri police said. They have registered a case and further investigation is on.
