We stumbled upon this picture of Salman Khan’s close associates, shot during one of his upcoming film’s recent schedule in  . What took us by surprise was the presence of the gentleman (circled) who looks strikingly similar to the actor. What’s also noticeable is that he’s wearing an outfit that Salman wore during the schedule. We wonder what the actor and this lookalike were doing together in the cool climes of Austria.
