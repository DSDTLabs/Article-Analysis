CHANDIGARH: Old furniture and other waste dumped in an open area on the first floor of   in Sector 1 caught fire on Thursday morning. No loss of office records, property or lives was reported. However, a   (CISF) canteen adjoining the dumped material suffered damages.

 The fire and emergency services wing of the municipal corporation received a call at 9.08am. The department pressed three tenders into service from sectors 11 and 17 fire stations. The firemen managed to douse the flames in half an hour, but since the dumped material had pieces of cloths and wood, the area remained engulfed in thick smoke, which cleared after more than two hours.
