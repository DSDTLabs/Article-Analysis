 : The state labour department, under its ‘Awas’ healthcare project for migrant workers, has distributed more than 1.5 lakh   among beneficiaries so far, which will ensure free medical treatment for them at all government hospitals.

 The biometric cards under the   project, which is also intended to form a databank of migrant workers or ‘guest workers’ as they have been rechristened by the state government, have been distributed to men, women and transgender people across 14 districts, said an official release issued here on Friday.
 
 The registration for the scheme is being carried out between 4am and 9am and between 6pm and 10.30pm in all districts. Teams of officials led by district labour officers are visiting labour camps, work sites and other places to register migrant labourers and issue biometric cards. And, the activities are strictly being monitored and reviewed by senior officials, the release said.
 
 The workers, who are registered under the scheme, will get free treatment from government hospitals and free treatment for up to Rs 15,000 in selected private hospitals. They will also get an insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh in case of accidental death. With regard to the insurance, neither the labourers nor their employers will have to make any contribution.
 
 The department will soon come out with the list of private hospitals where workers can seek free treatment. It is also fast completing the procedures for opening ‘facilitation centres’ for migrant workers in all districts.
