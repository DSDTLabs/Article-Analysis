This is the time to flaunt bright-hued dresses, short numbers with pretty lace works, embellished thong sandals and all those summer accessories. And our ladies are spot-on when it comes to dressing up right. A few days ago, we spotted these social butterflies at a star hotel, where they checked out the blow-out sale and spent quite a bit on all their summer fashion needs. 

 The ladies also caught up with each other on new hangouts in town, summer vacation plans, etc. To avoid stickiness and that stuffy feeling in this hot and humid weather, most of them were dressed informally and sported easy breathable outfits. On the other hand, there were a few of them who looked as if they had just bought everything off a mannequin and sported it with aplomb!
