AGRA: Claimed to be absconding since January 26,  , the prime suspect who gave the call for 'tiranga yatra' and was allegedly involved in   violence, was arrested on Tuesday evening. 

  Thakur was arrested when he along with a group of youths assaulted a Muslim youth for "playing cricket with local Hindu boys". 
 
  An exclusive video accessed by TOI purportedly showed Vishal Thakur with  , who was later killed in the violence, on a bike during the 'tiranga yatra'. 
 
  Gupta and Thakur, in fact, can be purportedly seen at the forefront of heated altercation with a Muslim group. 
 
  Two days before the yatra, Thakur had posted a 44-second video on his Facebook page on January 24, asking youths in a large number to join the rally. 
 
  A source said that Thakur is well connected with local BJP leaders. "One can still see pictures on Thakur's Facebook page, in which he is standing beside senior BJP leaders and even MLAs," he said. 
 
  Kasganj SP  , who has recently been promoted as DIG, said, "The youths were caught assaulting a Muslim youth during a cricket match. Vishal Thakur and his men, who were absconding since January 26, were infuriated to see the youths of both communities playing together. They entered the cricket ground and attacked the boy." 
 
  According to the police, of 11 persons arrested on Tuesday evening, nine accused were involved in the January 26 clashes, which led to killing of Gupta.
