Looks like the Telugu remake of Vikas Bahl’s hit film   will finally get underway, with a new director yet again. This time, it’s Prashanth Varma, who made his debut with Awe, who will helm the project. “Yes, Prasanth has been brought on board. The producers really liked his work in Awe and they felt that a young director like him would be ideal to give this film the makeover that it needs,” confirmed a source from the unit. 
The film, which has   essaying the role that Kangana Ranaut played in the original, has been facing one hiccup after another. First, national award-winning director Neelakanta walked away from the project, reportedly due to creative differences with the makers.

Actress Amy Jackson was scheduled to play the role of Lisa Haydon in Telugu, but she too opted out, and was replaced with  . Given the number of changes that this project has seen already, director Prasanth surely has his task cut out. “He is aware of what has happened but he agreed to come on board because he’s been given complete freedom to do the film in his style of filmmaking. he will be rebranding this film altogether, and the final result is sure to appeal to the Telugu audience,” the source added.
