NEW DELHI: In 2011, a nine-year-old girl was abducted from her aunt’s house at their village in Bhagalpur. Between then and now, she was enslaved, repeatedly raped and forced into  . Six years later, she fell in love with one of her clients who turned out to be her saviour. Police have traced down and arrested the accused trafficker named Chhanda from GB Road in central Delhi.

 When the girl, now 16, met the youth, she thought he would be like one of her clients who would violate her, but soon he started asking about her background. He kept visiting the same   several times during which the girl narrated her ordeal to him. He was moved by her story and had probably fallen in love with her. The youth then approached DCW chief   with a Facebook post on her page informing her about the girl.
 
 He was then called to DCW office and then to the police station where a joint team comprising of the police, DCW officials and volunteers from the NGO Shakti Vahini counselled him for further details about the girl’s whereabouts and her age. 
 
 The brothel was raided and the girl was rescued. She didn’t speak much and said she was 20. But later, she opened up and said she was told to lie about her age and volunteering for the work if there was a police raid. .
 
 The girl stayed with her maternal aunt after her parents died when she was a toddler. She was kidnapped from there by a woman. 
 
 The brothel owner initially made the girl stay with her daughter-in-law. But she was pushed into flesh trade when she turned 11. 
 
 But whenever there was a police raid, she was sent off to the other house. Escape bids were unsuccessful and she was punished severely. 
 
 The girl couldn’t remember the name of her village or relatives. “The border districts in Bengal and Bihar are trafficking hubs. We are holding meetings with the state authorities now to check the movements of these traffickers and put them behind bars,” said   from NGO Shakti Vahini.
