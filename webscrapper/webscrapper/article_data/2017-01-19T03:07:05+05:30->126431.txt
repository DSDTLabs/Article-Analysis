NEW DELHI: The   has accepted   Vijender Gupta’s “unqualified apology” over a   by him commenting on the functioning of the Rajya Sabha. While dropping breach of privilege and contempt proceedings against Gupta, the panel cautioned him to be “mindful of the position he holds and the dignity of the House he represents”.

 The report was tabled in the assembly on Wednesday.
 
 In an article published in a Hindi daily on January 22 last year, Gupta had written that the Rajya Sabha be abrogated. The committee of privileges, which has nine AAP MLAs on board and is chaired by Malviya Nagar MLA Somnath Bharti, concluded that “coming from a seasoned politician who is bestowed with the position of leader of opposition by the Speaker, the committee is dismayed at his lack of understanding of the functioning of democratically elected legislatures and their privileges”. It added: “Nevertheless, in view of the   tendered by him, the committee recommends that the breach of privilege and contempt proceedings against him be dropped…”
 
 The committee added that “it has no doubt in concluding that the article penned by Gupta was a serious assault on the prestigious and highest legislative body of India”. 
 
 Gupta twice sought additional time to file his reply to the committee. “He (Gupta) stated that the notice moved by KC Tyagi (then a member of the Rajya Sabha) was misconceived and vague. He, however, expressed regret if Tyagi had felt hurt...” the report said.
