CHANDIGARH: The two Class VI students ate two dozen tablets of iron on July 27 in a bid to become superheroes, the school authorities claimed after a preliminary probe and interaction with the schoolchildren.

 The students had a competition that who can eat more tablets and become “Iron Man”, a fictional superhero, the school authorities said.
 
 The students had consumed 24 and 27 tablets during free time in class. It was only when they started vomiting that the school authorities took them to Government Multi-speciality Hospital, Sector 16. Both were stated to be stable.
 
 The parents had questioned from where the students got so many tablets. The school authorities claimed that these were given to students under a health programme.
 
 “We did not know that our children got iron tablets in school. Even the school authorities did not guide us. They should give it to us not the children,” said  , mother of one of the children.
 
 Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, school education, is looking into the matter. Officials from the education department said principal   had informed   that its health committee is conducting an inquiry into the matter and will soon submit the report.
