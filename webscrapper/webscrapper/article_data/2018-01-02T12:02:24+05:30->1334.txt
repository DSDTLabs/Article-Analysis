The latest episode of   was a game changer for the contestants of the reality show. The twist in the tale came with the ranking task that Bigg Boss had announced on Monday's episode (1 Jan 2018).

 As per Bigg Boss' directives, the contestants had to rank themselves from 1 to 6 and they had to support their decision with reasons as to why they consider themselves at the spot selected by them. As expected, everyone wanted to be in the first spot and that led to discord and confusion in the house.
 
  was bent upon being crowned as the most entertaining member of the house and that's the reason he thought that he deserved to be in the topmost position.  ,   and   seemed to be in agreement with each other as all three of them concluded that it doesn't matter where they stand on the ladder as the being in the top 6 list was an achievement enough for all of them.
 
 Their diplomatic stance caused them a great deal when the task was concluded. Eventually, post the argument, Akash took the first spot, Puneesh the second, Luv the third, followed by Shilpa, Hina, and Vikas, in that order. Then, much to their dismay, Bigg Boss announced that the first two contestants (first and the second spot) are safe from getting nominated this week and one of the last four will get axed.
 
  
 This causes an uproar in the house. Akash Dadlani and Puneesh were seen dancing around in the house and Vikas and Hina rued their decision. What remains to be seen is if   will be able to fight his way into the finale week with him being the only commoner in the four contestants that face the nomination this week.
