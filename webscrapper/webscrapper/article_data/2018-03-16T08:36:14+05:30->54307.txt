PUNE: Airports Authority of India officials in Pune on Thursday said they have got the official possession of 15.84 acre land belonging to the Indian Air Force (lAF) and the construction on the plot will begin soon. 

 A tweet on Thursday by the Pune airport authorities said, “The IAF has given permission for work on the 15.84 acre land. This will speed up the projects of the airport.” 
 
 Former defence minister Manohar Parrikar in 2016 had said that the IAF will give the land to the Pune airport for expansion. An airport official, when contacted on Thursday, said,” We got the official letter from the IAF today and we can start construction on the plot.”

Last year, the IAF provided additional 16 acres of land to the   for expansion. The IAF has asked for land in lieu of the plots.
 
 “The state government is working on the matter and infrastructure committee chairman and Union minister   has already told the state to provide 15 acres of land to IAF and additional 10 acres to the AAI. Earlier this week, there was a meeting about this between Pune MP   and the PMC and next week the PMC will have a meeting with the IAF authorities. More land under IAF which is unused has been sought,” another official added.
