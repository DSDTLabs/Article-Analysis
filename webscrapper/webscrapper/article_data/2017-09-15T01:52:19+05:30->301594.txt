 “After the murder of a student at   in Bhondsi, we instructed all schools for a follow-up on police verification of all school staff. This guideline was first issued in March 2016, then again in June 2016. We are now looking into schools which are yet to complete their police verification, not only for their teachers but also for other staff,” said Priyank Kanoongo, NCPCR official.
 
 There 22 safety and security guidelines for schools in Haryana issued by different bodies, like police, CBSE, etc. 
 
 “Most of these guidelines are not implemented or followed. We at NCPCR are trying to bring out all these guidelines in India together in a manual,” said Kanoongo. 
 
 The NCPCR, which has prima facie found negligence on part of Ryan International School, has already sought reports from the district authorities, Haryana’s education department and CBSE, in the murder case of Pradhyumn.
