Panaji: Minister for information and technology Rohan Khaunte on Friday said that the incentives under the startup policy had been finalised and sent for cabinet approval. He also said that meetings were being held on a daily basis to ensure that the revamped IT investment policy could also be finalized and sent for cabinet approval before March 31. “All the work from our end is done and the schemes have been sent for cabinet approval. We hope to have the IT investment policy ready in the coming week so that both the policy and the schemes under the IT policy can be notified,” Khaunte said. The Goa IT startup schemes, expected to be rolled out in 20 days, focuses on employment generation and incentives for Goan entrepreneurs or startups based in Goa.  The policy promised massive subsidies and incentives for startups, the biggest highlight being a one-time grant of Rs 10 lakh to a startup with a promising minimum viable product. Special incentives have been announced for Goan startups, while declaring reimbursement of up to 50% of the salary for any startup where local youth are hired. However, six months after the policy was notified, these schemes have yet to be given formal approval thus denying startups of these benefits. The proposed Goa IT investment policy, a revamped version of the one that was notified in 2015, is also awaiting completion. The policy is expected to encourage the ‘IT Anywhere' concept through clusters and co-working spaces across the state. A key government source said that those companies that seek benefits under the IT startup policy will not be allowed to apply for incentives under the Goa IT investment policy. The state department of Information and technology is working with global consultant EY, formerly known as Ernst & Young. “We are holding meetings everyday to make sure that we can get approval for the IT policy and the schemes under it simultaneously,” Khaunte said.
