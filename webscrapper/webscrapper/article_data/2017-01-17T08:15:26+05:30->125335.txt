New Delhi: Many of the   cases are reported by those women who have consensual relationship with a man, but when the relationship ends, they use the law as a weapon for vengeance and personal  .

 A   said this while acquitting a man accused of rape on the pretext of finding the complainant a job on December 12, 2013. Following her statement, the accused was booked under rape charges besides relevant sections of the IPC.
 
 “I am of the view that the physical relations between the accused and complainant were consensual. The complaint is purely out of anger after a quarrel that took place between them over payment of commission. The prosecution has failed to prove its case,” additional sessions judge Sanjiv Jain said.
 
 Jain noticed that the complainant’s testimony was not consistent. The court observed that during her examination in chief, the woman had turned hostile. 
 
 “She did not state that she was raped. She even said that she was not taken for medical examination and that she does not remember what she stated in her statement..,” the court said.
 
 The prosecution contested that had it been a case of consensual relation, the woman would not have gone to the police. The court that was not convinced by the prosecution’s argument acquitted the accused of the offence punishable under Section 376 of the IPC.
