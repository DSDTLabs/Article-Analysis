GURGAON: For the past three weeks, residents of Sector 22B have been forced to live with the unbearable stench emanating from blocked   in their area. Allegedly, the drinking   supply has also been contaminated by sewage. But the civic body is unmoved.

 “Since all sewer lines in the sector are blocked, the sewage ends up overflowing near tanks holding potable water, contaminating it in the process. Many households complained of receiving foul-smelling water last week. While the issue of drinking water has now been resolved, sewer lines continue remain blocked,” said Joginder Singh, a resident of Sector 22B.
 
 The   (RWA) of the area alleged MCG ground staff don’t have required equipment to clean the sewer lines regularly. “After we submitted several complaints, MCG staff came and tried to clear the blockage, but failed. They excused themselves by saying the blockages were out of their reach. The staff does not have the machines needed to clear blocked lines. As the lines are not cleaned regularly, it leads to clogging,” said Bhim Singh Yadav, RWA president of the sector.
 
 The RWA has now threatened to organise a protest if the situation does not improve. “We also contacted senior MCG officials and gave written complaints. But the officials don’t even know where the sector is located. We now have no option but to protest,” added Yadav. “Due to lack of sunlight, it is taking more time for the accumulated water to evaporate from the streets. These spots have become breeding grounds for mosquitoes, even in this winter,” said Jyoti Sharma, another resident. Developed by Huda in 1985, Sector 22B has 610 plots, and hosts 1,800 families.
