Kakinada: In a classic example of man versus nature, the East   Riverine Estuarine Ecosystem ( ), which encompasses the second largest mangrove habitat along the east coast of India, Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, is under threat since 2007, when the then minister for major industries J Geetha Reddy announced that the Krishna-Godavari basin will be developed into a ‘petrochemical corridor’. Since then large-scale production activities have marked the region.

 Besides, the activities of allied sectors like oil and natural gas, fisheries, aquaculture, saltpans, industries, ports and shipping, communities in the region also heavily depend on the mangroves and marine resources. This is further accentuating the destruction of the ecosystem. Almost 50% of the 41 mangrove-abutting villages are highly dependent on them for housing, fuel wood, cattle grazing and others. 
 
 In an effort to restrict this trend, chief conservator of rorest, Rajahmundry circle, J S N Murthy told TOI that Egree Foundation is set to establish a multi-sectoral specialist administrative body which will address the challenges of the region. To that end experts from seven sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture, salt pans, oil and gas, fertilizers, port and shipping and tourism, would be invited to be honorary members in the Egree core committee and use their expertise to advise and guide the committee. 
 
 The project, which was actually conceived around 2011, aims to devise ways to mitigate the impact of production activities on coastal biodiversity. It would include, establishment of cross-sectoral institutional mechanism with representation from conservation, livelihood and production sectors. Second, enhancing capacity of sector institutions for implementing biodiversity-friendly sector plans including monitoring and enforcement of regulations and to improve community livelihoods and sustainable natural resource use.
