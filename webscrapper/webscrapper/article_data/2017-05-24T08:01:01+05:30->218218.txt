LUCKNOW: It was the   of LU on Tuesday but   in BSc (Mathematics) coupled with poor printing of the   gave a tough time to candidates. In the 'A' series question booklet, pages 13 and 14 were blank. Though university authorities changed the question paper, candidates complained about the time wasted in the process. 

 "No questions were printed on pages 13 and 14. As there were only 90 minutes to solve the questions paper, I had allocated a certain time to each question. Bad printing ensured I pored over the paper and then more time was wasted while the booklet was changed," said candidate Ankit Srivasatva. Another candidate, Shikha, said that in the Chemistry question paper, all choices were not printed in multiple choice.
 
 Making light of the glitch, LU admission coordinator Anil Mishra said, "Candidates who got badly printed question paper were given a new one immediately. The university gets 10% extra question papers printed for such an eventuality. We know that printing in bulk can lead to such a situation." He said that before the examination, candidates are instructed to check the question paper thoroughly. 
 
 Meanwhile, those who sat for Tuesday's exam found Chemistry easy and Mathematics section the toughest. "Calculus question were quite tough, Physics was lengthy and only chemistry was easy," said Shobhit Saxena. Another candidate,  , said, "I will lose most marks in the Mathematics section as it was the toughest." 
 
 On Wednesday, the university will hold entrance test of BSc (Biology) where candidates will be vying for admission to 280 seats at the second campus and the National PG College.
