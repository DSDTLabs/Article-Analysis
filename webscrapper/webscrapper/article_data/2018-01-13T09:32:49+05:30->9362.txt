GUWAHATI: A designated Prevention of   Act Court here on Friday sent   prime accused   to judicial custody. 

 The court, taking cognizance of a chargesheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) against Saradha group owner Sudipta Sen and his deputy, Debjani, in a money laundering case related to the group's alleged Ponzi scam in Assam last year, had issued warrants for producing the two accused in court. 
 
 Though Debjani was brought from Dum Dum Central Correctional Home in West Bengal, Sen was not produced in court here as he was scheduled to be produced before a CBI court in Kolkata on Friday. Sen is currently lodged in   in Kolkata.
 
 The court has directed to produce both the accused on January 25.
 
 In 2013, Assam Police had registered four cases against Sen and Saradha group of companies for defrauding depositors in the state. On the basis of that, the ED's Guwahati zonal office registered a case to investigate the money trail. Later, the ED filed the prosecution complaint at the designated   in September last year.
 
 Saradha Realty had allegedly duped thousands of people in Assam between December 2008 and February 2012 and collected money from them by allegedly making false promise of high returns. Sources in ED said public money worth over Rs 100 crore was duped in the Ponzi scam in the state.
