NAGPUR: Taking up pertinent social issues as the theme for   plays, part-time directors Anil   and   each presented a drama on the third day of Mahagenco Inter-Power Station Theatre Competition. 

 The competition began on Tuesday, giving employees of power stations from around the state a chance to express their artistic prowess. The plays on day three received appreciation from the audience and were a break from the lighthearted presentations of the previous day.
 
 The first play to be showcased was ‘Gharte Amche Chhan’, directed by Shinde, revolved round a controlling wife who finds her husband slipping away from her in spite of her tight clasp. Shinde said, “I have tried to explore the psychological abyss of a wife who pushes away her husband because of her attitude. The play tried to reaffirm the desirability of a healthy relationship.”
 
 In the evening, ‘Pankh Jahle Vairi’ investigated the all-pervasive presence of corruption and its effect on a middle class family. Play’s director   said, “This is a play written in the 70s by Ranjit Desai. It is a rather serious theme and I chose it deliberately as the content of the play had a social message relevant to the times we are living in.”
 
 Male lead in ‘Pankh Jahle Vairi’ Suraj Khoke said, “I have no experience of theatre whatsoever. Today is the first time I got to perform in a play. Even though I am used to speaking in front of an audience as part of my job, this was different because each move I made was invested with a lot of meaning.”
 
 Snehal Kulkarni, female lead of ‘Gharte Amche Chhan’ said, “This is a refreshing change from our daily routine. We have in the guise of the competition to explore our hidden talents. A competition like this creates a healthy workplace culture.”
 
 ‘Poha Chalala Mahadeva’ by Khaperkheda Power Station and ‘Shewanta Jitti Hay’ by Pophali Power Station will be staged on Friday.
