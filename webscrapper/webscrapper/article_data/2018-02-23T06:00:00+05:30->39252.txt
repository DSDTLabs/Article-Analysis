Working for NTR-Trivikram film is a dream come true for me.   garu has prepared a kick-ass script, it’s really extraordinary and I can’t wait to live up to the challenge,” says an excited   who has been roped in as the composer for the yet-to-be-titled NTR-Trivikram film, which will go on floors in March. Thaman has already begun work on the film and judging by the highly acclaimed background score he gave for the recently releases   and Tholi Prema, expectations are bound to be high. 
“This is the first time I’m working with Trivikram sir whereas I had the privilege of composing for NTR’s films Brindavanam, Baadshah and Rabhasa. NTR and Trivikram have always been supportive and encouraging. So, there’s a huge comfort zone with them. I’m really excited about working with such a combination,” says Thaman,who adds, “PS   is the cinematographer for this film and we all know that he is an excellent technician. The visuals will undoubtedly be breathtaking and that will give me a huge fillip as well.”
