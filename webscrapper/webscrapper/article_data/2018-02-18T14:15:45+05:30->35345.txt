MOTIHARI: Police have started an investigation into the alleged kidnapping of 19-year-old   Gupta, son of Dr   of   locality in Motihari. Dr Gupta is currently posted in Sheohar. 

 Chandrabhan’s brother   had lodged an FIR with Town police station in Motihari on Saturday, alleging that the former, who had gone to the shop owned by the family on February 13, did not return home.
 
 Sources close to Dr Gupta’s family said Chandrabhan’s cellphone was found in the shop. Police sources said Chandrabhan’s family members have so far not received any ransom call.
 
 SHO of Town police station   Kumar said police are probing the case from different angles as Chandrabhan had run away from his house in 2015 as well. “Chandrabhan was found in an unconscious state at Muzaffarpur station eight days after he went   in 2015. His family members had lodged a case of kidnapping even then. There has been no ransom call this time as well. Thus, we are investigating the case from different angles,” Anand said.
