NEW DELHI: Delhi   on Monday granted   to   legislator  , who was arrested for allegedly assaulting Delhi chief secretary Anshu Prakash last month. Justice Mukta Gupta granted relief to the Okhla MLA, who was arrested on February 21, and imposed stringent conditions similar to the one it had imposed on the other accused, MLA Prakash Jarwal, earlier.

 “Khan has served an incarceration of more than 20 days and no further custodial interrogation is required. So the petitioner is released on bail,” HC noted after hearing the arguments. HC asked Khan to furnish a personal bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of the like amount. In his plea, Khan had argued that since he is not required for any custodial interrogation, “nouseful purpose shall be served by keeping him under incarceration.”
 
 Through his lawyer, Khan had also submitted that being a sitting MLA, who works for the betterment of society, he has dedicated his life to the service of the people, adding that cases against him were politically motivated. During the hearing, Delhi Police opposed relief arguing that Khan was named in 12 criminal cases, out of which he has been discharged in three cases. The court had on March 9 granted bail to Jarwal in the CS assault case with a warning that any illegal activity in the future would lead to the cancellation of his bail.
 
 Amagistrate had earlier denied bail to the two MLAs, saying the matter cannot be treated in “a casual and routine manner” while referring to their alleged history of involvement in offences. In his complaint, the chief secretary alleged that on February 19, he was beaten up by Jarwal and Khan in the presence of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal at the CM's residence, where the top bureaucrat had been called for an emergency meeting.
