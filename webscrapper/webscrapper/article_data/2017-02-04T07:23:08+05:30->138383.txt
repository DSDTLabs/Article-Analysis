AHMEDABAD: The   department of the district collectorate on Friday slapped a notice on Gypsy Events, which had organized   Arijit Singh’s   in the city in December last year, directing the organizers to pay  . Sources in the district collectorate said that tickets worth Rs 3.68 crore were sold for the concert but the organizers had not paid taxes.

  Bhadresh Shah, the deputy mamlatdar of the entertainment tax department, said that the notice was sent because the organizers had not given satisfactory replies to the district collector’s previous notice sent in December about the tickets sold and preparations made for the concert. According to a government notification, 17% entertainment tax is levied for shows like these, based on the number of tickets sold.
 
 The tickets for Singh’s concert, which was held on December 24, ranged from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Interestingly, despite demonetization and severe cash crunch, all tickets for the box — which has 10 seats, each costing Rs 1 lakh — were sold out. The district collector had ordered an inquiry and a confidential report was submitted.
 
 Sources said that tax officials had also sought details from the organizers of the revenues earner over the period of two years. Interestingly, Singh had also performed in the last edition of Sabarmati Festival. However, it is unknown whether tax for that show had been paid. If the tax is found to be unpaid, then the taxable amount, in addition to any penalty will have to be paid.
