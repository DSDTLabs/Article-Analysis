BJP national president   looked for a rapprochement with the Lingayat community by visiting some prominent mutts in Karnataka, but he faced an awkward situation on Tuesday when he visited the Murugha Mutt in Chitradurga town. 

 Taking him by surprise, Murugha Mutt pontiff   submitted a memorandum, seeking approval of the minority religion status for   as recommended by the Karnataka government. 
 
 Moments later, the visibly upset BJP leader left the mutt in a huff, citing a busy schedule. 
 
 In his memorandum, Murugharajendra said: "A Lingayat movement is on in Karnataka, pressing for minority status for the Lingayat community. Though it appears there is a conflict between Lingayats and Veerashaivas, it is just temporary as people from both sects have been issuing emotional statements. The Karnataka government has rightly recommended granting of minority religion status for Lingayats. It’s not a step to divide community but a medium to unite.”
