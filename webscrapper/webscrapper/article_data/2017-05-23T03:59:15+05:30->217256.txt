GURUGRAM:   had no idea what fate had in store for her when she visited   on Sunday evening. 

 In the end, not only was the media professional left with a leg injury due to “negligence of the mall management”, her exasperation was compounded by the “unapologetic” staff at the mall, who “refused to give her first-aid”.
 
 “I was leaving for home around 9.30pm after I was done with my shopping. Suddenly, I tripped over something and fell. I could not understand what had happened,” she recalled. 
 
 Hauzel had tripped over an electricity panel board between the Aldo and Mango showrooms on the ground floor, which had apparently been left lying open by negligent staff. Her husband came to the rescue, and helped her sit on a nearby bench. But more shocks awaited the couple, when they called the mall staff for help.
 
 “More than the incident, I was shocked by the behaviour of the staff. They were unapologetic about the whole episode, and advised me to get medical assistance on my own,” said Hauzel.
 
 She added the mall staff did not even have a basic first-aid kit with them. “In case of an emergency, they have no medical services to offer. This just shows how safe we are in swanky malls,” she said, adding, “My husband and I realised we were wasting time arguing with the staff. So we left.”
 
 However, Hauzel was concerned that other visitors might go through a similar experience. “I wrote to the mall management to ensure the issue gets addressed,” she said.
 
 As TOI reached out to  , an official of the mall management, he said, “We have spoken to her and assured her we will fix the switchboard.”
