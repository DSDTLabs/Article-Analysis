  He character would require her to wear a sari and in between shoots and breaks, Rishina started lifting weights. But she did it in costume! “ It's not difficult doing dumbbells in a sari when   bai can fight a battle in a sari can't I do dumbbells. It is actually actor   who was my co-star in previous show   from whom I got the idea of taking dumbells on the set as there we used to work out together on the set. Another friend who is gym obsessed is my Uttaran co-star  .”
  
  Talking about her workout, shoots and personal life balance, she said, "My mom taught me that family comes first and other things are secondary! I cook, I work, I workout and I even flaunt my body when required I believe in a balanced life. Time management is the most important part of my life. I manage everything because I am today's multi tasking woman who leads a very systematic life. I am not gonig to gym anymore and focusing on alternate form of fitness”
