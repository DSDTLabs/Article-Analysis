TRICHY: The public staged a demonstration against the arrest of a person in relation to the ongoing   demanding permanent closure of an explosive factory at   near Uppiliyapuram in   district on Saturday.

 The villagers have been protesting over the past ten days demanding permanent closure of Vetrivel Explosives following a blast in the factory in 2016, which claimed 19 lives.
 
 The protesters alleged that though they had been staging demonstration in a smooth manner over the past few days, the Uppiliyapuram police personnel made a forced-entry into the houses of select protesters on Friday night in the name of inspection.
 
 One Krishnakumar, who was said to have confronted the police over the inspection, was arrested on Thursday night. As a result, the villagers performed a road roko demanding the release of Krishnakumar. DMK MLA Stalin Kumar also reached the spot and participated in the protest.
 
 One of the villagers claimed that the police had broken into his house last night in the name of the inspection. “I was not at the house but the police entered into my house against the will of my family members. Only women were there at that time,” he alleged.
 
 Krishnakumar was said to have been released by noon. But when the agitators refused to give up the protest even after the release, the police arrested 34 people, including 32 men and two women and dispersed the crowd. The arrested agitators were released later in the evening.
 
 Protests have been staged regularly by the villagers of   ever since the blast. Following the accident, NOC for the factory was cancelled by the district administration, but it was restored this year by Trichy DRO. But last month, the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court granted an interim stay against the restoration of a NOC.
