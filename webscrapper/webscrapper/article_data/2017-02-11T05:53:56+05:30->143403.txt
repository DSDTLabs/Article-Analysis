PUNE: The India Meteorological Department’s latest   update has indicated a gradual transition to an El Nino-like condition around September — the last month of monsoon. 

 Met officials, however, stressed that a lot of uncertainty prevailed on the possibility of another   during the latter part of 2017. A clearer picture would emerge only in April.
 
 Though uncertainty prevails on the likely impact of the upcoming El Nino-like situation on monsoon, experts reminded that 2014 had witnessed an El Nino-like situation, but it had affected the monsoon that year.
 
 El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an irregularly periodical variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern  . The warming phase, which is thought to impact India’s southwest monsoon, is known as El Nino and the cooling phase is called  .
 
 AK Sahai, head, climate research and services, IMD, Pune, told TOI that the forecast indicated that the present weak La Nina conditions were likely to weaken further and “cool ENSO neutral” conditions were likely to establish during the early part of monsoon, followed by “warm ENSO neutral” conditions during the latter part of the season. The warm ‘ENSO neutral conditions’, in layman’s terms, translate to El Nino-like conditions.
 
 DS Pai from the IMD, Pune, said preliminary observations did not indicate any likely impact of these conditions on this year’s monsoon. “El Nino-like conditions may be witnessed somewhere around September this year, but we do not expect any impact on this year’s monsoon. Future forecasts will give a clearer picture of what will actually happen.
