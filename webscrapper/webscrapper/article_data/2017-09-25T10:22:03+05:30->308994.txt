COIMBATORE: A group of   and college students are on a mission to create an urban jungle in the middle of the city . They have planted more than 3,250   of 140 different   in and around the  
S Sokkalingam, an   involved in the work, said their mission is to set up a different kind of urban forest.
 
 “We are using the Miyawaki method, by which the saplings will grow very fast.These saplings are of various species. Many endangered species have been planted. Singanallur lake is known for its biodiversity and we want to conserve it. So, we began planting saplings a year ago. The lake was in a critical state that time, but now we have transformed it,“ he said.
 
 “We hope that city residents will appreciate and replicate the process in their homes. Also, we are sure that others will follow the model we have set up here and restore other lakes in the city as well,“ Sokkalingam told TOI.
 
 Vinny R Peter and Joseph Reginald, who have been visiting the lake for the last 10 years along with their friends and volunteers, have taken significant steps to conserve the lake.Other volunteers such as the Rapid Action Force are also planting saplings there.
 
 “This is a great opportunity for school students to study about the environment and learn more about urban bio-diversity,“ said Vinny . “We have planted rare varieties such as Cycas circinalis and pterospermum at the site. We selected only those plants, which will attract birds,“ she added.
 
 The volunteers have also formed an organisation called CUBE that has active participation of government officials and local NGOs.
