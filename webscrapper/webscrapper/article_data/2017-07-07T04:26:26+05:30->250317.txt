KOLKATA: The city woman, who was allowed by the   to abort her 26-week foetus, continued to undergo a procedure to terminate her pregnancy at the SSKM Hospital on Thursday. Her family sources revealed that the process may take another 24 hours to be completed. The woman, who had sought an   on the ground that her foetus suffered from an untreatable disorder, was stable. 

 Experts around the country have hailed the court order even though Indian laws don’t allow abortion after 20 weeks. “It is in no way risky. In fact, late abortions should be allowed in cases like these, both for the sake of the parents and the child. It makes no sense to give birth to a child who would not survive more than a few weeks,” said Nikhil Datar, a Mumbai-based health expert and gynaecologist. Datar has examined the woman’s medical reports. 
 
 Last week, the court had formed a seven-member expert committee to supervise the woman’s health conditions. The committee had earlier ruled that the abortion was justified since the birth of the child could affect the mother’s mental health. The abortion is being done at the SSKM Hospital through a non-surgical method. Medicines are being used to abort the foetus. The process usually takes 48 hours.
