GUWAHATI: Five years after an engineer in the   was killed under   while he was conducting a probe into a   in the department, his family continues its  . 

 Godapani Pathak was gunned down on May 3, 2012 by unidentified miscreants. He was on his way back from Dhubri district after conducting a departmental inquiry into the alleged smuggling of power pump sets and power tillers for farmers to Bangladesh through the Dhubri border. Congress was in power at the time.
 
 Pathak's widow, Swarnali Deka Pathak, has been seeking a CBI probe into her husband's murder. "Top officials of the state police had promised speedy investigation. Five years have passed and I'm still waiting for justice," she said.
 
 The engineer's murder had rocked the state. Following immense public pressure, the state government had recommended a CBI inquiry into the case. The CBI, however, said it could not take on the investigation due to resource constraints. Subsequently, the Assam Police CID started its investigation. 
 
 What it unearthed was that several government officials of the department had hired militants of the Kamtapur Liberation Organization (KLO) to abduct and kill Pathak. The engineer and his colleague Faizul Islam were abducted at Abhayapury on May 2, 2012 while they were returning after conducting an inquiry at Gauripur in Dhubri. A day later, Pathak's bullet-riddled body was found in Bongaigaon. Some 25 days later, Islam was rescued from Salkocha in Dhubri. In July that year, KLO militant Hiranya Roy confessed to having killed the engineer.
 
 The investigation from this point on made no headway, however. "The Sonowal government vowed to fight against corruption and my husband died fighting corruption. I request the chief minister to take up the matter and endorse his commitment to justice," said Swarnali, preparing for her husband's shradh on Wednesday.
