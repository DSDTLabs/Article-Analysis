NEW DELHI: BJP president   today in a letter to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu wrote that the latter's decision to quit the NDA government was "unilateral" and guided by "political considerations".

 
  "This decision is both unfortunate as well as unilateral. It is a decision; I am afraid, will be construed as being guided wholly and solely by political considerations instead of development considerations," Shah wrote.
  
  
 The BJP president was responding to TDP's decision to quit the NDA on the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh.
 
 In his letter Shah reiterated the contributions made by his party for Andhra Pradesh saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has always held the interest of the people of the state paramount.
 
 “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left no stone unturned in ensuring the growth and prosperity of the people of Andhra Pradesh,” he wrote.
 
 Earlier this month, TDP - which has 16 MPs in Rajya Sabha - announced its decision to quit the BJP-led NDA at the Centre, a week after two of its representatives left the Narendra Modi government and a day after YSR Congress moved a no-trust motion against the Modi government over the issue of special status for Andhra Pradesh.
