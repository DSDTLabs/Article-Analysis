Story writer and director K V   needs no introduction but it is very convenient to say that he is the father of director S S Rajamouli, who is now basking in the new found glory of international fame. 

 
 Rajamouli's masterpieces were all from Vijenyendra Prasad's pen and the story writer who also worked for Salman Khan's 'Bhajrangi Bhaijaan' is already busy starting his next project after 'Baahubali'. 
 
 
 
 Insiders suggest that Vijayendra Prasad has actress   and choreographer-turned-actor-turned director Raghava Lawrence in mind for his next project, which will be simultaneously shot in Tamil and Telugu.
 
 
 More to it, the movie will be directed by one of the assistants of director Rajamouli, who will make his debut as a director. While there is no official confirmation as yet, we hope this interesting project as it sounds will materialise soon.
 
 
 Meanwhile, Vijayendra Prasad has sourced script and directed a sci-fi thriller 'Valli' starring Neha Hinge and Rajat, which is ready to hit the screens.
