HYDERABAD: Decoding   V Radhika Reddy’s  , in which she wrote 'My brain is my enemy,' psychiatrists say she may have had multiple thought processes in her mind due to problems she was facing and unable to control them.

 
 Institute of Mental Health (IMH), Erragadda, superintendent Dr M Umashankar told TOI, "Going by what she had written in the suicide note, Radhika might have immersed in multiple thought processes which she couldn’t control and, due to the depressive disorder, she might have ended her life. If Radhika had followed   properly, this would not have happened. Depression these days is 100% curable. 
 
 She would have come out of it after treatment and counselling.” Doctors claim 8-10% of patients, who go to general out-patient (OP) wings in city hospitals, have psychological issues like depressive disorder, speak about headache and other physiological symptoms and doctors, lacking awareness, treat them with painkillers.
 
 Depression should be viewed as a medical condition and, if treated as per doctor’s advice, can prevent several suicides. “Constant stress due to financial, family, relationship, health and other issues will lead to depressive illness, which requires treatment. Usually, people come out of short-term depression. If it is for a significant duration, say more than two weeks, then family counselling and treatment should be taken up. If there are multiple episodes of depression, it requires a few years of treatment, ” Dr Umashankar said “At least 8-10% of patients at general OPD suffer from some psychiatric illness.
 
  They are not aware of their problem and complain about headache, body pains and sleeplessness. And doctors, failing to recognise the illness, give them painkillers. According to NHRC guidelines, all doctors have to be trained in psychiatry. Of 40 to 50 new out-patients everyday, we treat at least 15 to 20 of them for depressive disorders,” added.Umashankar.
