Morphed pictures and brilliant creations of Photoshop are proof that this country has no dearth of talent. A prankster seems to have recreated a perfectly real-looking fake voter ID card in superstar  's name.

 The fake card not only has Salman's photo printed on it but also has   as his father's name! (with a spelling error though; 'i' in   replaced with 'e'). It further states that Salman Khan is 64 years old. However, a look at the picture on the ID and one would know it's an image downloaded from the Internet.
  
  
 It is reported that the incident took place during the   (GHMC) elections. Someone placed Salman's photo on someone else's ID. It is yet to be confirmed whether it was an oversight on someone's part or it was intentionally mishandled. Either way, we wonder how the ' ' star would react to this.
