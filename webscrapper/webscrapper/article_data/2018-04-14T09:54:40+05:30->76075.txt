CHANDIGARH: Residential societies of Sector 48 are facing acute water shortage. And they have the flawed vision of the   administration to blame for the situation. According to them, the administration's refusal to allow them to build underground reservoirs has worsened their plight. 

 During a visit to societies, it was found that in the absence of the underground reservoirs, the residents are left to make their own arrangements by installing water tanks on the ground floor to pump the water to the upper floors. Residents said the UT administration assured them of water supply and asked them not to construct underground reservoirs. 
 
 B S  , president of Kendriya Vihar RWA, Sector 48 said that for the past two months the situation is getting from bad to worse as only ground floor houses are able to receive normal water supply on time. He said they have raised the issue with the authorities and they assured the residents that there was a tube well near the society from where a direct line would be connected to the society to improve the water pressure in the residential area. He said the team also took measurement of the line but till date no concrete action has been taken.
 
 Anjana Sharma, a resident of the same society, said there was no fixed timing of water supply to the first floor of the society. It varies from 3.30am to 4.30am every day and the residents have to wake up early to do their domestic work. She said women even wake up early to wash clothes.  , another resident said that the worst affected are the residents of the second floor who face immense pressure in summer.
