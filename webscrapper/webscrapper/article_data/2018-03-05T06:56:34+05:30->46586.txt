BARNALA: A large crowd has been reaching Barnala’s   for the past four days to be witness to a five-day book fair, the latest effort by the local police force to wean youth away from drugs.

 The fair started on March 1 and will continue till March 5. Going by the response of people, Patiala range IG A S Rai has said he will approach the director general of police to organise such fairs for all districts of the state and make them an annual affair. 
 
 Rai said police wanted to promote literature in meaningful ways, as it could make youth shun social evils and crime. “If we are able to make people tilt towards literature, it will be our biggest effort in changing the way people think,” he said. 
 
 Social activist   called for women to play a proactive role in eliminating social evils and said literature was the best medium to achieve this. “Literature could also help eliminate evils like dowry, female foeticide and sexual harassment of teenaged girls at the hands of relatives,” she said.
 
  said police thought of bringing literature to the forefront for making the lives of people easier. 
 
 Though sale of books was not much, people evinced interest in literature and appreciated the effort of police, said a publisher, Amit Mittar, who set up a stall at the fair. National Book Trust, Punjab languages department,   and 34 publishers had stalls at the fair.
