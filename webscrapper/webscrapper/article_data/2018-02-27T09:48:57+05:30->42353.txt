CHANDIGARH: The neighbour accused of killing a six-yearold girl was produced in a local court on Monday and remanded in police custody for two days to know the motive behind the crime.

 The Industrial Area police claim that accused Kamlesh has been changing his statements every hour and not telling them why he killed the child. Deputy superintendent of police (east) Satish Kumar said: “Earlier he was saying an evil spirit possessed him and then he denied killing anybody. By changing his statements frequently, he is trying to pretend to be mentally unfit.”
 
 So far, police have no evidence to link him with some occult practice like black magic but they have his custody for two days to solve the riddle why he murdered Ujala. Police say he is a drunkard but he was sober at the time of the incident. Still, they have sent his blood sample for examination to check if he was on some drug.   (CFSL) will analyse the child’s viscera sample for signs of sexual assault before murder. The girl’s parents claimed her body after autopsy on Monday.
 
 The girl was playing near his house when murdered. Accused Kamlesh is said to have pinned her under his legs, pulled her hair back, and slit her throat in full public view at Sanjay Colony in Industrial Area Phase-I on Sunday. The neighbours caught him and turned him over to the police. “The girl met a gruesome end. He killed her like he was sacrificing an animal,” said an eyewitness. The accused is from Buxar in  , works in a printing factory in Panchkula, and lives five houses away from Ujala’s family.
