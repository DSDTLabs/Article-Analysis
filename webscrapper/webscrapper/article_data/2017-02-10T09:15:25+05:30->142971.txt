BENGALURU: The Citizens' Initiative for Jayamahal Area, a group of residents, has launched a signature campaign to protect the 112 trees earmarked for cutting to facilitate widening of the road leading to Mehkri Circle from the   side. 

 On Thursday, the team went around the neighbourhood collecting signatures from people who will be directly impacted by the loss of the canopy.
 
 "Cutting trees on this stretch would impact the area in many ways-more number of vehicles will add to pollution. The heat will increase and the cool shade will be gone. We are just trying to do our bit to protect our neighbourhood's future," said  , one of the members. 
 
  The signatures will be submitted to the assistant conservator of forests, BBMP. The BBMP forest cell had issued a public notice asking citizens to file their objections, if any, to the cutting of trees as per the request of the road   department. Earlier in the morning, BBMP officials surveyed the trees on the stretch.
