AHMEDABAD: In a startling finding of a study conducted across 10 Indian cities, 38% of women at workplaces said they were victims of  . 

 The study was jointly conducted by   (NCI) and   (INBA). 
 
 Another shocking revelation was that 69% of women who faced   at the workplace never complained about it.
 
 “Most women chose not to complain owing to fear, embarrassment, lack of confidence in the complaint mechanism, lack of awareness and also due to the stigma attached to sexual harassment,” the study says.
 
 It was also found that immediate colleagues, superiors and others in the organization sexually harassed women, for durations ranging from six months to over a year. The study was carried out in Mumbai, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Pune, Assam, Jalandhar, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Lucknow, with 6,047 respondents in BPOs and the IT industry, education, legal and health services among other sectors.
 
 Sanjay Kaushik, MD, NCI, said, “Companies must take this issue seriously and act promptly. If women find their complaints being addressed, they will be encouraged to complain and the harassment will end too.”
 
 Kaushik also emphasized raising awareness in working women about the law that protects them. 
 
 Yet another startling finding was that 75% of women were harassed through inappropriate touching and lewd comments while the rest faced sexism of many sorts and were even asked for sexual favours. Advocate Zameer Nathani, honorary national secretary of INBA, said, “The extent of unawareness is shocking. The Act has clearly defined the rights of women right from where to complain and duties of the internal complaints committee, protection to the victim, rights of respondent, among others. Awareness will help deal with cases in a better way.”
