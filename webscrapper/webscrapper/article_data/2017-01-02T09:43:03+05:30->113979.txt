LUCKNOW: The first day of the year marked a day of chaos for commuters in the city. While large number of people stepped out in the evening to celebrate New Year, the enthusiastic supporters of chief minister  , on the other hand, were seen celebrating his elevation as Samajwadi Party’s national president. The dual celebration impacted the movement of traffic, choking all major arteries of the city. 

 The chock-a-block situation was seen from morning till late night. Scores of supporters, from far off villages, arrived in the city on December 30, 2016, the day Akhilesh was expelled from the party. Heavy influx of vehicles in the city, as a result, created bottlenecks at all major crossings. The   supporters were seen rejoicing on roads, blocking the movement of traffic on Shahnajaf Road, near   office, Hazratganj and near KD Singh Babu stadium. Similar situation prevailed at Hazratganj Chauraha, Shahnajaf and Sapru Marg intersection, Parivartan Chowk, Mahanagar Churaha and Engineering College Chauraha. 
 
 “We planned to watch a movie today but due to traffic congestion, we changed our mind and decided to have fun at an eatery on the road side,” said Ankur Sahu, who was stuck in traffic near Shahnajaf road. People spent a greater part of their day commuting in the city. “We left home for dinner at a restuarant in Hazratganj. But congestion on roads took us good 1 hour to reach the place. As a result, we decided to have snacks at a roadside eatery,” said  .
