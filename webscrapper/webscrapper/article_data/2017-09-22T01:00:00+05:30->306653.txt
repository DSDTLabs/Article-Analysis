 knows how to have his friends enjoy with him. One such occasion was his birthday party recently. Instead of throwing a conventional lavish party, he decided to invite a set of close friends, including  , who will soon be seen opposite him in the TV show 'Ikyawann', his former co-actors   and   with his wife  . 

 Interestingly, instead of the customary birthday bumps, Namish was at the receiving end of birthday fists from his friend Karan. He says, "Prachi and karan wanted to do something different, which is why they used me as a punching bag and gave fists instead of birthday bumps."
 
 The common joke at the party was about his heroine's height; Prachi is taller than him, which is a first for the five-feet-ten-inch tall actor. Namish says, "Karan joked that I should start wearing heels to match my heroine's height. In fact, I too, was surprised when I met Prachi for the first time because all the girls I have worked with till now were shorter than me. Of Course, I don't have a problem working with an actress, who is taller than me. It's not the eight but the chemistry, which is more important and is of interest to the viewers."
