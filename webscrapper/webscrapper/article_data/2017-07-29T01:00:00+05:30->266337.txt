The number of youngsters pursuing academic courses that don’t interest them and continuing with jobs that don’t excite them is on the rise. One of the main reasons for this is that they are afraid to drop out and get branded as failures. But what if dropping out could mean getting an opportunity to make one’s dreams come true? To help those who dropped out from the system to create their own destiny,   is launching a unique reality show, 'Dropout Pvt. Ltd'. to make their entrepreneurial dreams come true.
The show, which will see a start-up formed on television for the first time, will take viewers through the process of identifying and forming an ideal team with dropouts. They will then be groomed by a panel of masters —  , CEO & Founder of Droom.in, Anisha Singh, CEO & Co-founder Mydala.com,  , CEO & Co-founder of Games2Win, along with Raghu Ram and Rajiv Laxman, who have created and co-developed the show with MTV.
 Ferzad Palia, Head, Youth, Music and English Entertainment, Viacom18, said, “India is brimming with young untapped energy keen on making ideas come to life. Through 'Dropout Pvt. Ltd'., we aim to empower these youngsters to kick-start their entrepreneurial dreams.”
 Added Sandeep Aggarwal, “Entrepreneurship is nothing without risk-taking. It is the real test of one’s conviction, confidence and courage and the ones who take risks ultimately reach their destination. This show will be a great kick-starter for all the risk- takers out there.”
 'Dropout Pvt. Ltd'. airs every Saturday, starting tonight at 7 pm on MTV.
