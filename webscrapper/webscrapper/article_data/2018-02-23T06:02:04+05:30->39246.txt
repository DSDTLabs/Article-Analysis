CHENNAI: A 23-year-old Central   trainee constable shot him-self dead with his service rifle at   ( ) in Avadi on Thursday morning. 

 Kailash Chander Rai, a native of Odisha, killed himself with a 5.56mm INSAS assault rifle, firing at least one round to his forehead, an officer with the   police said. "He was guarding the RTC armoury when   personnel heard a gunshot at 8am after a training session," the officer said. "They found Rai in a pool of blood. A doctor at the training centre said he died instantaneously."
 
 The police have sent the body to   Government General Hospital for autopsy. RTC officers told investigators that Rai had started training at the centre 10 months ago. He was due to complete his training in April. The officials informed the Avadi Tank Factory police about the shooting death shortly after the doctor pronounced Rai dead.
 
 "We did not find a suicide note but other trainees said he he had told them about a family dispute and had appeared depressed about the issue over the past week," the officer said. "Since then, he mostly kept to himself."
 
 He said the police would send the body to Rai's hometown in Odisha after the autopsy is carried out on Friday.
