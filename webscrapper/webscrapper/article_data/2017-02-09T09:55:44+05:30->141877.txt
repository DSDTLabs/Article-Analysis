NAVI MUMBAI: A Goa picnic for a group of eight friends from   turned tragic as seven were killed and one was critically injured on their way home. Their car veered off the Mumbai-Goa highway, NH-66, plunged down a slope and crashed into a tree early morning on Wednesday.

 The accident spot is in Ratnagiri district. The impact of the hit was so great that the car was mangled, crushing its occupants. Every year, over 1,000 accidents occur on the highway, the deadliest in the state. Widening NH66, a promise overdue, will take at least four years more.
 
  
  Highway police said the person driving the vehicle, a Mahindra Xylo, probably dosed off at the wheel. The highway at the point where the accident occurred is only 60 feet wide (a little over 18m) and has an additional 6 feet (1.8m) of service lanes. Since the margin of error was low and since there were no railings there, the car met its fate within moments.
 
 The car, which was coming from Goa, went into the opposite lane before going off the road. The jackfruit tree into which it crashed was six feet down a slope. 
 
 The accident occurred around 6.45am near Khanu village, about 5km ahead of Pali village in Ratnagiri district.
 
  
  Most of the eight childhood friends had graduated from the same institution in in Vile Parle (east)â€”Sathaye College. The deceased are:  , 29, who was driving the car (which belonged to his second brother);  , 29, who has left behind a pregnant wife; Prashant Gurav, 27, who was planning to get married; Nihal Kotian, 21, who worked with Metro Rail; and Vaibhav Manve, 30, Mayur Belnekar, 24, and Kedar Todkar, 26, who were the only children of their parents.
 
 The sole survivor is Abhishek Kambli, 22, a final year BA student. He sustained injuries on the limbs and his back. He was initially admitted to  , but later shifted to a hospital in Mumbai. His condition is critical.
