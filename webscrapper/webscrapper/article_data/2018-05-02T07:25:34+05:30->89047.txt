LUCKNOW: Samajwadi Party on Tuesday announced that it would contest both the   Lok Sabha and the Noorpur Vidhan Sabha byelections, which are being viewed as a test of the recently-forged opposition unity in Uttar Pradesh. SP spokesman Rajendra Chaudhary said the decision was taken in a meeting presided over by party chief Akhilesh Yadav.

 The move is being seen as SP’s bid to mount pressure on   (RLD), which is adamant on fielding Jayant Chaudhary, son of party chief  , from Kairana. If the RLD and the SP field separate candidates, it would be a setback to the muchtouted opposition unity. 
 
 The polling for the two seats would be held on May 28. Both ruling BJP and the opposition are locked in a fierce fight for the Kairana seat so they can showcase the victory in the run up to the 2019 general elections.
 
 A senior SP leader told TOI that RLD “should not contest” in Kairana because it is an SP stronghold as the seat had earlier been won by party leader Munawwar Hasan, and after his death, by his wife. Even in 2014 parliament elections the SP stood second. He added that RLD is seen as a Jat outfit and the Muslims of west UP, who suffered during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots, would not back it as many Jats were accused in the riot cases. The BSP will not contest the byelections and instead back the SP candidates, following the recent pact between the two parties.
 
 Sources in the SP said that negotiations are still on between SP and RLD to field a joint opposition candidate in Kairana to counter the BJP.
 
 RLD spokesman Anil Dubey told TOI that a final decision on Kairana candidate would be taken only after talks with like-minded parties.
 
 The SP leaders, however, flayed the statements of some   leaders in Kairana who want the party to field its candidate. “The Congress should back a joint opposition candidate if it wants to defeat the BJP,” SP leaders said.
