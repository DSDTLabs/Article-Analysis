SHILLONG: It is one of those rare times when football has taken backstage for the people of the city ahead of Shillong Lajong’s last I-League encounter of the season on Monday. With results of the state’s Assembly elections out on Saturday, the craze for football on the streets is at a low ebb.

 
 But any such distraction will be far from the minds of Lajong’s final opponents of the season -   - who will be gunning for three points in order to keep the reins of the title battle in their own hands. And Monday’s game at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here will be the first of their two must-win matches in that direction. And coach Khalid Jamil did not mince words on the matter. 
 
 “It is a vital match for us. But it will also be a difficult one. Everyone - defence, midfield and attack - will have to give their 100% for us to get the three points on the day,” Jamil stressed. They have 29 points from 16 games and a victory against Lajong will bring them on par with current leaders Minerva Punjab, who have played one more tie than them.
 
 East Bengal have looked to peak at the right time and their 7-1 drubbing of Chennai City in the last tie gave enough evidence of that. And to Jamil’s benefit, he will have a fully-fit squad to take on the Meghalaya club. With Ansumana Kromah and Dudu upfront and Mahmoud Al Amna and Katsumi Yusa playing providers, they will have a formidable attack on the day.
 
 The only glitch in Jamil’s scheme of things will be the absence of defender  , who is suspended. Young   may once again be given the opportunity of a start or the coach may bring in the experienced Arnab Mondal.
