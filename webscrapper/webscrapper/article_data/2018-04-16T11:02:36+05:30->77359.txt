CHANDIGARH: If we were to go by the information available on the UT education department’s website, it would not be wrong to state that the department has remained a laggard in renewing   certificates of the city-based private schools.

 According to the details available on the website of the department, recognition certificates of 65 private schools, out of total 73, are yet to be renewed. Out of these 65 schools, the certification of 31 schools ended on March 31. What is more interesting is the fact that the department is yet to recognise 34 schools whose certificates are awaiting recognition since April 2016 and April 2017.
 
 There are a total of 73 private schools in the city. Out of these, 34 are senior secondary private schools, 22 high schools, 13 middle schools and 4 primary schools.
 
 Out of the 34 senior secondary schools, recognition certificates of 17 schools expired in March 2018; certificates of eight schools expired in 2017 and one school is waiting since 2016.
 
 Similarly, out of the 22 high schools in the city, recognition given to 13 schools expired on March 31, 2018; seven schools in 2017 and one expired in 2016.
 
 Situation of the city’s 13 middle schools is no different. While recognition certificate of one school expired in March this year, as many as 11 middle schools remain unrecognised since of 2016 and 2017. Certificate of the remaining one school would expire in 2019.
 
 All the four primary schools’ recognition expired in March 2017.
 
 Meanwhile, the schools whose certificates were renewed so far for the academic session (2018-19) include   in sector 7;   in Sector 28; Sacred Heart Senior Secondary School in Sector 26;   in Sector 36; Ajit Karam Singh International Public in Sector 41, Chitkara International School in Sector 25 and   in Sector 24.
 
 “The process of renewing the recognition certificates that were pending since 2017 has been completed. The letters are being sent to the schools to inform them. The committees formed by the department are in the process of inspecting schools, whose certificates expired in March 2018. We hope to finish this within a month,” said director of school education Rubinderjit Singh Brar.
 
 He added that the department has plans to go online in a bid to avoid such delays in the future.
 
 “We had applied for a recognition certificate in November 2017 keeping in mind that it would expire on March 31, 2018. The inspection was also done by the department. However, we are yet to get the confirmation,” said authorities of a school requesting anonymity.
