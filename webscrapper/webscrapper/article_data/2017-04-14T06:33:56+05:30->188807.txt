CHENNAI:   in   have been lying vacant since October 24, but the   (SEC) has told Madras high court it can complete the   only by July and not by May 14 as promised earlier. 

 Seeking extension of time, SEC secretary T S Rajasekar in an affidavit in court on Thursday said the commission would complete preparation of electoral roll of local bodies by May-end, based on the timeline prescribed by the   (NIC).
 
 The matter relates to an appeal against a single judge order on a writ petition filed by DMK organising secretary R S Bharathi. The judge, who struck down the poll notification, originally directed that local body elections be completed by December 31, 2016. The SEC filed an appeal, and after much nudging by the division bench, agreed to complete the process by May 14.
 
 Earlier this month, an attempt to win more time from a different division bench failed as the court made it clear the SEC would face contempt of court proceedings if it did not adhere to the single judge deadline of May 14. 
 
 The SEC then filed the present affidavit.
 
 The SEC said it had initiated action for preparation of photo electoral rolls for elections to local bodies and the work was being executed by NIC based on the assembly electoral roll as on January 5. Test data was handed over to NIC, it said, adding, "SEC handed over to the NIC all assembly electoral roll data on January 30. The conversion of data from ECI format to NIC format is a must to facilitate multiple online data entry work in all local institution to be done on NIC servers."
 
 Data of 5.92 crore voters has to be demarcated and assigned specific wards in respective town panchayat, village panchayat, municipalities and corporation, it said. Correlation statement between the assembly electoral roll and local body electoral roll will be completed by last week of April, it said.
