PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: A total of  ,000 cubic meter silt has been removed from Pavana dam in the past two years and desilting work has begun for the current year.

 Speaking to TOI, Shiv Sena Maval MP Shrirang Barne said, "The dam will be able to store additional water sufficient for 45 days. The desilting work has begun with the permission of the district collector. The work will continue till the onset of rains in June. Social organisations and farmers are also involved in removing silt from the dam for use in farms. Around Rs 10 lakh was spent on the MP local area development fund in the first year and another Rs 10 lakh will be spent this year.‚Äù
 
 The desilting work generally begins before mid-May when the water levels in dam go down significantly, allowing for vehicles to remove silt. The work is now being conducted in villages of Thakursai, Ambegaon and Khadak Devade, said Manohar Khade, section engineer, Pavana dam, state irrigation department.
 
 The dam was built in 1970 on Pavana river, which is around 40 km from PCMC limits. Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation lifts 490 million litres per day (MLD) to supply drinking water to around 20 lakh population.
 
 Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) lifts another 100 MLD from this dam for industrial areas in Pimpri Chinchwad, Hinjewadi IT park and other areas. Major towns of Talegaon and Dehu Road along with many downstream villages depend on the dam to meet their drinking water needs.
