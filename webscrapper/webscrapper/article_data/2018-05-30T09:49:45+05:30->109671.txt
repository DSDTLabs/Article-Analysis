NEW DELHI: Bank services all over India will be badly affected as nearly ten lakh officers and employees of the state-run banks announced to go on strike on May 30 and May 31. These bank employees are not satisfied with their wages that have been revised merely two percent.

 Bank unions are demanding an increase in salary, improvement in other service conditions and a quick wage revision settlement of officers up to scale VII.
 A number of efforts to defer the strike failed as the meeting between   (UFBU) representatives and the Labour Department, Finance Ministry and   officials could not result in favourable outcomes.
 
 The Chief Labour Commissioner (CLC) favoured the issues and asked the Indian Banks Association (IBA) to respond positively. The IBA representative said they will consider the revised offer but requested the UFBU to quantify the demand.
 
 Regarding the demand about revising wages, the IBA said that six banks have given a restricted mandate. IBA also brought up the fact about the losses that banks have incurred in the past few days.
 
 UFBU leaders gave certain figures to prove how operating profits are now two times, staff expenses reduced and business more than doubled.
 
 CLC said the employees have to be paid for hard work and not based on profit. The IBA is not ready to accept a new offer but assured to continue the negotiations.
 
 On the officers' level, the IBA agreed to discuss with banks but could not give any assurance. 
 Nearly ten lakh officers and employees will be on strike on May 30 and May 31, 2018.
