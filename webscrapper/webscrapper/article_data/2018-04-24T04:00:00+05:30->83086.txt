Surat: The election for the post of Southern Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SGCCI) vice-president on Sunday was fought on caste lines,   

 In the fight for supremacy, Ketan Desai, a chemical and dyes distributor, defeated Bhadresh Shah by securing 1,399 votes of the total 2,760 votes. Shah received 1,065 votes.
 
 While the current vice-president Hetal Mehta was declared president of SGCCI for 2018-19, Ketan Desai was declared elected vice-president. Total votes polled were 2,809 of which 48 were invalid.
 
 BJP and Congress leaders in the city were divided on their support for the candidates contesting for the VP's post. While Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) standing committee chairman Rajesh Desai, BJP leader and vice-chairman of Surat District Co-operative Bank Sandip Desai, Congress leaders like Rizwan Usmani and Darshan Naik campaigned for VP candidate Ketan Desai, BJP MLA from Majura constituency Harsh Sanghavi and former standing committee chairman Nirav Shah supported Bhadresh Shah. Navsari MP C R Paatil’s close confidant and former SGCCI president Paresh Patel was supporting Ketan Desai. 
 
 The SGCCI election committee on Saturday observed that candidate Bhadresh Shah had violated the election code by canvassing in the media. 
 
 The election committee had decided not to declare the result until May 22 if Shah was elected vice-president. The committee will be scrutinizing allegations by Shah's opponent on violation of election code within one month.
 
 Rupin Patchigar, former president of SGCCI, told TOI, “Caste factor and politics have taken centre stage and presence of mahajans (traders and industry people) has diminished in SGCCI elections.”
 
 Darshan Naik, member of the Surat district panchayat, said, “They started with the caste factor and we were forced to fight on that line. All Desai, Patidar and Surti community have voted in Ketan Desai’s favour.”
