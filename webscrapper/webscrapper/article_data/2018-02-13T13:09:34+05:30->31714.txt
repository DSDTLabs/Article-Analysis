In 2016, when the   started building an elevated bridge across   river between Arapalayam and  , it proposed a plan to make the British-era structure housing Arapalayam Water Works a municipal museum showcasing the rich past of Madurai and its civic infrastructure.

 The corporation’s plan had allayed fears of razing down the heritage structure. Arapalayam Water Works was the first major civic project carried out by   under British sanitary engineer J A Jones.
 
 City engineer A   had then told TOI that the corporation has taken up the site for beautification at a cost of `5 crore. 
 
 The stone building will be restored to its original glory by sandblasting and the roof will be repaired. The vehicle stands would be removed and the site will be landscaped for an art gallery, Mathuram had said then.
 
 But two year later, like many of the corporation’s empty promises, this too has not been kept. The old structure is in ruins. Its roof is badly damaged and wild vegetation has started to grow. Inside, the old machinery is in a shambles, wires dangle from the roof and the floor has been taken up by stacks of broken tiles.
 
 In a recent interaction, Madurai Corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar had said the corporation would take up a project to renovate the structure soon. "It is a beautiful building and we are going to beautify it soon," he had said.
 
 But his words are yet to turn into action.
