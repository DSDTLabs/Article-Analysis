Actress   has bought few screenings of her recently released 'Hidden Figures' and offered the tickets to low-income moviegoers. 

  
  
 The 46-year-old actress, who lives in Chicago, wanted to 'share the film with people in her adopted hometown' which is why she purchased an entire show of the film at the city's AMC Ford City 14 location.
 
 "Henson purchased the theater's largest auditorium, which boasts 211 seats 210 of which were filled for the presentation," a theater staff said. Previously, Henson's one of the co-stars from the 'Hidden Figures',  , also provided free tickets to Los Angelenos over the   King, Jr Day weekend.
