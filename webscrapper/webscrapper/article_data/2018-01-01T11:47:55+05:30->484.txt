THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:  , a project envisaged to ensure the cleanliness of   where an estimated 15 million pilgrims visit annually, is now scripting a new lesson in religious harmony in Kerala. 

 'Punyam Poonkavanam', which propagates the idea that cleanliness is godliness has attained a new dimension with the Muslim community in a small village at   joining the mission. The office bearers of Erumeli Jamaat are now regular participants in the review meetings of the mission. "We not only practice cleanliness as part the programme, but also encourage our children to be a part of the mission," says P A Irshad, president of Erumeli Muslim Jamaat. Students of the schools under   regularly participate in the programmes organized at Erumeli as part of the project. 
 
 The initiative has taken a distinctive path as the entire mission has been combined with spirituality. "The mission aims at practicing and preaching the edict - cleanliness is godliness," says   range IG P   who is the chief coordinator of Punyam Poonkavanam programme. "We are implementing the scheme in a phased manner. The first step was demonstrating cleanliness, the next was creating that awareness and now we are ready to enforce it," says Vijayan.
 
 The shopkeepers at Sabarimala have been directed to abstain from the use of plastic and penalty will be levied if they break the regulation. The fines could soon extend to devotees as well.
 
 In the first phase of the scheme, the message would be conveyed to the guruswamis who lead a group of pilgrims from other states to Sabarimala. The project has to begin from the temples where pilgrims begin the journey for Sabarimala, by avoiding articles wrapped in plastic in the 'irumudi'.
