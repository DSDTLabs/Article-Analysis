New Delhi: BJP state chief Manoj   has prepared a proposal to make embankments on both sides of the   and commercially exploit the land that will therefore be freed up. Tiwari, who is not the first to have suggested this remedy, will put the plan up before the urban development ministry soon. He has proposed calling the freed-up land ‘Yamunosa’ on the lines of Singapore’s Sentosa Island.

 Speaking at the   state annual session on Thursday, Tiwari said that despite thousands of crores having been spent on the river, the previous governments have not been able to clean it and it makes commercial sense to allow private players to develop the huge cache of floodplain that is available in Delhi.
 
 “About 22 km of the Yamuna flows through Delhi and we have 12 sq km of land that is lying free. There are entire countries that exist on 12 sq km, like the Vatican. The Thames river in London has embankments on both sides and is so clean. Why can’t we do the same with the Yamuna? Singapore has developed Sentosa on reclaimed land. If Yamuna is commercially developed, the government will earn lakhs of crores,” he said.
 
 The proposal to create embankments along the Yamuna was also floated by Metro Man E Sreedharan in 2009, a proposal taken up seriously by Delhi government a few years later when a PWD team visited Ahmedabad to study the Sabarmati riverfront development project to see if it could be replicated in Delhi. Environmentalists have called the plan absurd, saying that the Yamuna river system is unlike the Thames and no project can be blindly replicated. Delhi’s water   Kapil Mishra said that he was open to discussing Tiwari’s plan but that he did not think it was practical.
