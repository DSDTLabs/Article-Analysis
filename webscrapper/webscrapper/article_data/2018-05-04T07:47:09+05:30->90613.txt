PUNE: Whenever   is reminded of the night he was stranded at the  , with lots of luggage, he is left fuming. “It was 2am, and the cab drivers at the airport refused — without giving a valid reason — to go to Kondhwa. There was no one at the counter too. I was forced to take an autorickshaw, which was packed with my luggage, leaving little place for me to sit,” says Suman.

 
  
  
 
 Suman is not the only one with the grouse against the taxis at the airport. Complaints of dangerous driving, refusals and   employed by cab aggregators at the Pune airport, especially in the late night hours, have been in focus for some time.
 
 While Ola and Uber, the two big cab aggregating companies, have assured that steps are being taken to improve the experience, passengers claim they are facing several problems with the taxi drivers. 
 
 Pune resident Kushal recalls incidents that took place on April 23 and 30. “I had booked   from inside the airport premises. However, each of the three times I booked the cabs to go to Pimple Saudagar area, my booking was cancelled by the drivers. This happened at 1am. I have written to Ola, but they have not reverted yet,” Kushal wrote to TOI.
 
 Both the cab aggregators were sent a detailed query, but no response was forthcoming from them.
