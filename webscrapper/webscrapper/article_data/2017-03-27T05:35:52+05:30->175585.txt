LUCKNOW: While the newly appointed chief minister   continues to be in a crackdown mode, what the state bureaucracy is eagerly waiting for is a large-scale administrative  . In a major departure from the tradition followed by previous chief ministers, the Yogi government has gone slow in the   reshuffle so far.

 Contrary to this, while Mayawati went for a major overhaul within hours after taking over as the CM in 2007, Akhilesh took just a couple of days to get officers of his choice in 2012. 
 
 By that standard, Yogi has broken both the previous records as he has not gone for any major   even after a week in power. Ever since being sworn in as the CM along with his 46 cabinet colleagues including two deputy CMs, Yogi has been on an overdrive on cleanliness, anti-Romeo squads and crackdown against illegal slaughterhouses. 
 
 But what has surprised the IAS and IPS fraternity is that he is doing it without picking and choosing officers of his choice.
