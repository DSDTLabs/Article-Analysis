In   recently to perform at the   Habba, singer   says that he was surprised to see how well maintained the city was. “The last time I was here was a long time back. When I landed here, I was surprised to see how clean and well maintained the city was,” he says.

 On asking how the experience while performing at the Mysuru Dasara celebration was, Nakash says, “It was the first time that I was performing here and I was excited and nervous at the same time. There was a lot of pressure on me as I had to live up to the expectations in my home state. But I was happy to be a part of it.” Nakash sang both Hindi and   numbers during his performance, much to the delight of the audience. “It was wonderful to see people appreciate the Kannada   that I performed. I sang Beku Beku from Upittu and Ani Suti De from Mungaru Male,” says Nakash.
 
 The singer, who is also a big foodie, says that before leaving Mysuru, he made sure to grab a box of Mysore Pak. “Though I didn’t get time to explore and eat some local delicacies, I did make sure to pick some Mysore Pak,” he signs off.
