NOIDA:   (29) is no used to attention, having survived Bigg Boss to emerge winner of the 10th edition of the reality TV show, but how he handles this remains to be seen. With assembly elections days away, both the SP and BSP candidates for Noida reached the Sector 46 ground to “congratulate” the local boy, as his family got ready to welcome him home on Tuesday.

 A family member confirmed that both parties have sought support from Manveer and family members. Representatives of both parties, though, denied making any direct offer, saying Manveer was “welcome to join their campaigns if he wanted to”.
 
 There was a buzz in the air as Sector 46 got ready to welcome Manveer. The ceremony — organised at the open ground in the sector by his family and supporters — saw hundreds of people from the Gurjar community thronging since morning to catch a glimpse of the winner. Then, SP’s   and BSP’s Ravikant Mishra, both candidates from Noida, turned up at the venue, unannounced, to “congratulate Manveer”. 
 
 Maternal uncle Karan Singh confirmed that both parties had made “offers” to Manveer. “Offers had come from both parties. [BSP supremo] Mayawati’s brother had come over and met the family, and asked elder brother Anoop Gurjar to join their campaign if Manveer refused, but we said they would have nothing to do with any political party,” he said.
 
 But the BSP candidate was cagey about making any offers to either brother. “I had gone to congratulate him. He is a Noida boy and has done very well. If he wants to support us, he is most welcome,” said Mishra. SP spokesperson   was also non-committal. 
 
 He told TOI their candidate Choudhary had gone only to congratulate Manveer, as they knew each other. “We need support from everyone. If he wants to join [our campaign], he is welcome,” he said. Manveer’s family said as of now, he won’t campaign for any party.
