VADODARA/ANAND: The   Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) seems to have taken a cue directly from the pearls of wisdom that usually grandparents share with their generation next. 

 GCMMF – the apex marketing body of all the district dairy unions of Gujarat that markets Asia’s largest milk brand Amul, will soon launch ‘Haldi doodh’ (turmeric milk) nationally. And to satiate the taste buds of generation next, ‘Haldi doodh’ will be rolled out across the country with an ‘Irish drink mocktail’ – both being introduced for the first time in the country. 
 
 The Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Limited popularly known as   has started production of the two new varieties of milk which will be available to consumers in easy to open end (EoE) cans. 
 
 “We have capacity to manufacture 1.50 lakh units of each of this products,” said Amul Dairy’s managing director Dr K Rathnam, adding that the two new varieties are being manufactured at the Amul Dairy plant in   by utilising the milk union’s existing infrastructure. 
 
 “Haldi is already known as a superfood for its immunity boosting properties. Particularly with milk, it forms a centuries-old ayurvedic remedy for a host of ailments,” said GCMMF’s managing director R S Sodhi.
 
 “Not just in India, ‘Haldi doodh’ is celebrated globally and is famously called ‘turmeric latte’. At times, with a host of medicinal properties, it acts as a household remedy,” he said. 
 
 The Irish drink mocktail (off course without its famous whiskey) on the other hand is inspired from the famous Irish coffee having its origins in Ireland. 
 
 With the launch of the new milk based beverages, the country’s largest co-operative is targeting Rs 100 crore – nearly 5 % of the total milk based beverage market, said GCMMF officials. 
 
 “We are confident that Irish drink is bound to disrupt the beverage category and become the new high of 2018,” said the official.
