PATNA: Patna SSP   has shifted SI B K Chaudhary of the Beur police station to Police Lines after he allegedly spoke rudely with JD (U) MLA Shyam Rajak and made a station diary entry against him for “pressuring” to help a woman in a land dispute case on Friday.

 Sources said one Sushila Devi had approached the MLA for help in a land dispute case pending at the Beur police station. The MLA called SI Choudhary, who was the officiating SHO, but the SI allegedly did not properly greet Rajak and rudely replied that the matter was handed over to another officer for investigation.
 
 The sources said the SI’s behaviour irked Rajak and a verbal altercation took place between the two over the phone. An alleged audio clip of the conversation between Rajak and SI also surfaced, in which Rajak is heard telling the SI that he would get him suspended.
 
 MLA Rajak later came to know that the SI had made a station diary entry regarding the incident. Furious, he along with his supporters reached the police station around midnight and sat on a dharna, demanding that he be arrested.
 
 SSP Maharaaj and City SP (west) Ravindra Kumar rushed to the spot, and pacified Rajak. The SSP later attached the SI to the Police Lines and directed Phulwarisharif SDPO Ramakant Prasad to conduct an inquiry into the matter.
 
 SDPO Prasad told this newspaper that the SI did not even inform senior officers about the incident.
