NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday asked Prime Minister   why had he made no mention of Panama papers in his radio address, saying that Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh’s son was named in the papers that had caused the downfall of Pakistani Prime Minister  .

 Congress said it was not the only instance of gap in the Prime Minister’s claims about fighting corruption, claiming that the “use of massive sums of money to engineer defection” among party’s Gujarat MLAs ahead of   elections and the formation of government in Bihar with JD(U) were examples of corrupt practices by  .
 
 “The PM speaks at length on corruption, but ignores Panama paper leaks. The name of Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh's son and Lok Sabha MP Abhishek appeared in the Panama papers, (but) what action have you taken in this regard,” Congress spokesman   asked.
 
 Khera said BJP cannot keep “subverting democracy” and “yet come out holier than thou and talk about political integrity”.
 
 “Where is the money coming from in Gujarat? Our MLAs said they were offered money (to defect). We are not getting any answers to this in the Prime Minister's  ,” he said.
