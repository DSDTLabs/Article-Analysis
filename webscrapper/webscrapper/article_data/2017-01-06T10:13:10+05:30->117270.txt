LUCKNOW: The months-long feud in  's first family, which came to a point of virtual no return on January 1, is likely to end on Friday with a ray of hope emerging after yet another day of hectic parleys to end the deadlock between   Mulayam Singh and his son   

 Senior minister  , who has been making efforts to forge a truce between the father and the son, said on Thursday that 'good news is likely to emerge soon'.
