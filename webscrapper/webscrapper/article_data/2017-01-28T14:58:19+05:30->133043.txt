PATNA:   is likely to be a surplus state in terms of power availability as National Thermal Power Corporation ( ) has targeted to commission unit-I of stage-I of Barh Super Thermal   (BSTPS) by the end of this year.

 K S Garbyal, regional executive director (east-I) of NTPC said on Friday the unit-I of the much-delayed stage-I of BSTPS would be commissioned by the end of second quarter of upcoming fiscal (2017-18), in which Bihar would have an allocation of 1025MW.
 
 “Though there were some delay in construction of BSTPS stage-I, all such issues have been dealt with. We have targeted to commission unit-I by the end of second quarter of 2017-18 and unit-II and unit-III with interval of nine months,” said Garbyal.
 
 Besides, Bihar would get cheaper power from BSTPS as NTPC has commenced production at its Pakri-Barwadih coal mining block in Jharkhand from December last year. The annual coal production capacity of Pakri-Barwadih coal project is 1.5 crore tonnes and a significant chunk would be supplied to BSTPS. Apart from Pakri-Barwadih, NTPC officials claimed that coal mining would soon commence at Chatti Bariyatu and Keredari projects as work on it is in advanced stage.
 
 The foundation stone for stage-I of BSTPS was laid in 1999 and it was initially proposed to be commissioned in March 2009, which was later extended to 2012. The progress in the project was delayed due to various issues, including unavailability of land and contractual disputes.
 
 For instance, the project was delayed by 36 months due to contractual disputes between NTPC and the initial contractor, Russian firm Technopromexport (TPE). NTPC has terminated the contract of TPE in 2014 and awarded a fresh contract to Doosan Power Systems for completing the remaining work.
 
 The total capacity of stage-I of BSTPS is 1980MW, out of which Bihar’s allocation is 1025MW. Bihar is already getting 1011MW of power from stage-II of BSTPS, which has two units of 660MW each.
 
 Garbyal claimed that NTPC has targeted to increase its total installed production capacity in Bihar by 4710MW by the end of 2019-20. The targeted increased production would come from stage-I of BSTPS (1980MW),   (750MW) and Nabinagar Super Thermal Power Project (1920MW) at Aurangabad. The total installed capacity of NTPC in Bihar at present is 4520MW.
 
 Bihar requires around 4000MW power daily during peak summer season. As things stand now, maximum power allocation from the central sector stands 3003MW, and 220MW from its   and 110MW from unit-I of Barauni Thermal Power Station. Besides, around 1000MWpower is purchased from open market for which short-term and long-term agreement has been made with different power producers.
