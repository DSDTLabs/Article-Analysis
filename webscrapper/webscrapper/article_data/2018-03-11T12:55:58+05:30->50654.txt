PUNE: Strongly opposing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights and Marraige) Bill (Triple Talaq Bill), Asaduddin   on Saturday told a massive gathering of Muslims that   were sufficient to protect the rights of women and that there was no need for the central government to enact a separate law.

 Owaisi, who is president of the   and Hyderabad MP, was speaking at a function organised by Muslim organisations in Pune under the banner of   (AIMPLB) at the Azam campus grounds in Pune Camp. Owaisi is also an executive member of the  .
 
 The AIMPLB has given a call to Muslims in India to organise rallies and functions to oppose the Bill.
 
 Owaisi’s objection to the Bill is based on the fact that it dose not distinguish between civil and criminal law. He termed the Bill as a conspiracy against Muslims and a move to punish men from the community. For instance, if a husband is sent to jail for three years, then who will provide maintenance to his wife and children and will the Central government take the responsibility of rehabilitating the women. 
 
 The Bill has been passed in the Lok Sabha, but could not be passed in the   with the Opposition demanding that it be sent to a select committee for a detailed scrutiny.
 
 Owaisi said, “We will not allow the Bill to be passed in Parliament because it is against Shariat. Islam protects the rights of women and we will continue to fight for their rights. We will not allow the government to interfere in our personal laws. We love our motherland and we are ready to sacrifice our life for the nation.”
 
 Earlier, the Pune police issued a notice to Owaisi and warned him not to make controversial statements.
