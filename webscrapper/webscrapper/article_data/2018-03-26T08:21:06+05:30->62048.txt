HYDERABAD: The historic   lake will soon become more polluted with local authorities planning to divert municipal sewage to the water body constructed about 450 years ago. Neknampur lake is one of the three major water bodies created by   IV. The other two: Ibrahimpatnam lake, has shrunk and almost dried up; and the   is a breeding ground of superbugs. 

 Pipelines are being laid to divert waste from   township to Neknampur lake. 
 
 The Save Our Urban Lakes (SOUL), an organisation working to conserve city water bodies, has questioned the decision to divert domestic waste generated in several colonies to Neknampur lake. In fact, it has written to the   seeking its intervention.
 
 The lake was desilted in 2016. As late as February this year efforts were made to cleanse the lake using a green technique called floating islands. Incidentally, the lake is listed for conservation and "beautification". The lake was once fed by the excess rainwater, but today it is fed by municipal and industrial waste. The SOUL has demanded original water spread of the lake be restored and its buffer zone be fenced.
