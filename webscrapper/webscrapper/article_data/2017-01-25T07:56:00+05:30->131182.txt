Chandigarh: A war of words broke out between the Congress and Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday, over a letter allegedly written by AAP’s in charge of Punjab affairs, Sanjay Singh, to party supremo Arvind Kejriwal “suggesting him that his public appearances at rallies in Punjab needed to be brought down in wake of unfavourable findings in an internal survey by the party”.

 AAP has claimed that the letter is fake. Sanjay posted a picture of his passport signature on Twitter to point out that his signatures did not match. He alleged in the Tweet that it was the “dirty tricks department” of Congress campaign strategist Prashant Kishor that was behind this letter.
 
 Kishor’s team retorted by pointing out that the passport picture posted by Singh itself was fake as it showed one-year validity.
 
 The letter attributed to Singh added, “As you know, the internal survey on the upcoming assembly elections in Punjab has not been in our favour. The situation right now is that Congress has got a hold on 69 seats and is working on 11 others. Today, we are still ahead of Akali Dal, but this situation too might change in the coming days. In view of this, my suggestion is that your rallies should be slowly declared and local leaders be brought to the forefront. This way if we lose the Punjab election, you can be distanced from the result. It is required for the 2019 election.”
