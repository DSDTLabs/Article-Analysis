THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The Congress on Thursday rejected K M Mani's statement that he was not aware of the local leadership of his party planning to get CPM help to get the KC(M) nominee elected as president of the   district panchayat president. Instead,   president M M Hassan demanded the resignation of Mani and his son, Jose K Mani, who won from their constituencies on   tickets.

 The Congress said that if Mani was sincere, he should ask the party's Kottayam district panchayat president to resign. “No one will believe that K M Mani is innocence in this,“ said  .
 
 Senior Congress leader K C Joseph said the press conference called by Mani was to avert a split in his party. There is no justification for the betrayal by Mani and hence there is no possibility of a truce with his party.
 
 “Mani and his son have no moral authority to continue in the positions they have got under the UDF umbrella. All the positions enjoyed by his party because of UDF should immediately be relinquished,“ said Hassan.
 
 K C Joseph said that even though Mani was trying to downplay the Kottayam episode with Thursday's press conference, he himself knows that he is struggling to take his partymen into confidence.
 
 Joseph said the UDF will not trust Mani anymore and the UDF does not want his support. “The Congress will not accept Mani's statements today because he is not sincere. The Congress does not believe that the decision to align with the   was taken without the knowledge of Mani and his son,“ said Joseph.
 
 He added that the Congress is no longer interested to have any ties up with   (M) and is ready to withdraw all the support in the local bodies. It is not the Congress alone which is going to lose because of this, he added.
