  According to forest officials, the species is poorly known with virtually no information on its population status, habitat requirements, diet or breeding biology. Knowledge of the species is almost entirely a result of observations from a few captive individuals.
  
  R Suresh Kumar, senior scientist, department of endangered species management from Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, told TOI, “The Tricarinate   has remained poorly studied. There is still paucity of information on crucial aspects like breeding biology, activity pattern and habitat requirements. Observations suggest the species hibernate during winter months and this requires further study.”
  
  The species is generally reported from the Himalayan foothills and riverine grasslands along the rivers Ganga and Brahmaputra.
