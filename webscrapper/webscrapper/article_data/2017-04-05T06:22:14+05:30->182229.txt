KOLHAPUR: A 24-year-old man was found murdered near a petrol pump located at Mangarayachiwadi phata on   on Monday.

 The deceased — identified as   Gulab Mirzai, a resident of Herle, taluka Hatkanangle — worked at a fabrication firm.
 
 According to the police, the killer hit Yasin on the head with a stone and after killing him, dragged his body to the national highway. A complaint in this regard has been registered at the Peth Vadgaon police station.
 
 Dhananjay Jadhav, police inspector in-charge of the police station, said, “On Monday, we received information about a person killed in a road accident and his body lying on the national highway.”
 
 He added, “We found that the victim’s two fingers and thumb of the right hand were chopped off. The body was taken to   where a postmortem was performed, which said the victim died due to head injury.”
 
 Jadhav said that from the available evidence, the victim was killed and did not die in a road accident. “We suspect that Yasin was killed somewhere else and his body was later thrown on the highway. Yasin was married and was working in a firm in Herle village,” he said.
 
 “On Sunday evening, Yasin told his wife that he had got a call from a customer regarding some fabrication work, saying that he would return home by night after taking measurements,” he added.
 
 Police said they were gathering information about the person who had called Yasin on Sunday night. 
 
 “We are optimistic about getting clues once the caller is traced,” a police official said, adding that all angles are being looked into.
