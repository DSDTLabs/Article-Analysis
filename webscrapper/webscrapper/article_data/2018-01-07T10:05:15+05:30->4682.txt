PANAJI: Tiny Goa pips many much larger states when it comes to land ‘left behind’ by Pakistani nationals. The Union government recently informed the Lok Sabha that the coastal state comes fourth in the list of states with land owned by Pakistani nationals, also known as ‘enemy property’. 

 Most   properties are in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, and Delhi. Government sources pointed out that despite Gujarat sharing a border with  , the state has only 146 ‘enemy properties’, compared to 263 in Goa.
 
 Enemy properties in Goa are those whose survey numbers are registered in the names of Goans who migrated to Karachi and other locations which became part of Pakistan in 1947. After these Goans accepted Pakistani citizenship, their properties were declared enemy properties in 1965. On September 11 that year, a central government notification stated that all immoveable properties in India belonging to, or held, or managed on behalf of Pakistani nationals were to be treated as enemy properties, and that control over them was to be vested in the custodian of enemy  .
 
 Most of these, in Goa, are in the talukas of Bardez and Salcete, while a few lie in Tiswadi, Bicholim, and other parts of the state. 
 
 The home ministry had forwarded a list of enemy properties to both of Goa’s district collectors, directing them to collect lease rent from their occupants. 
 
 Interestingly, several people have approached the courts staking claim to these properties. 
 
 Matters relating to enemy property are dealt with under the Enemy Property Act, 1968, the Enemy Property Rules, 2015, and the Enemy Property (Amendment and Validation) Ordinance, promulgated by the President of India on January 7, 2016.
