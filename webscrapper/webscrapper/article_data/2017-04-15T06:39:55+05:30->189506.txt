GANDHINAGAR: After the inhuman attack by ‘gau rakshaks’ on dalit men who were skinning a dead cow at Una, and with several similar attacks on the community by local goons, the state government has decided to conduct a survey of all those employed in skinning of dead animals. The state cottage and rural industries department, which promotes ‘Charma Udyog (leather products)’ has started a survey of skinners, to introduce welfare schemes for them.

  A K Rakesh, principal secretary, cottage and rural industries said, “The state government runs a welfare scheme for leather workers. After the  , has decided to survey all people involved in skinning animals, issue identity cards and register them with our offices. It will help the government carry out various welfare activities. The survey will cover all villages and cities. All the workers will be issued identity cards and we will train them. The government has allocated Rs.50 lakh for the survey and welfare programme.”
 
 “We are also starting a programme for training and skill development of traditional service providers like barbers, tailors, carpenters etc. They will be given tool kits for self-employment,” he added.
 
 Last July, dalits men were beaten up by gau rakshaks at Una, which shamed the   government and it has hence started fire-fighting efforts. The new survey of most backward communities among dalits and welfare schemes seems to be an effort to douse the anger in the community about Una and other such incident over the last year.
