AHMEDABAD: To revive and promote heritage textiles, a fashion show, ‘Walking Hand-in-Hand’ was held at   on Thursday. Organized as part of  , the show, conceptualized by Crafts+Design+Society (CDS) Art Foundation, presented a line of couture which were co-created by textile craftsmen and fashion  .

  “The idea of walking hand-in-hand is to let craftsmen and designers collaborate and co-create the line of garments and make both of them walk the ramp so that the textile craftsmen get their due credit. Moreover, this recognition goes a long way in encouraging others to learn the art and keep it alive, while innovating,” said Asif Shaikh, founder, CDS Art Foundation.
 
 The line of garments were created using traditional   such as ajrakh, bandhani, ikat, Maheshwari weaves, Banarasi weaves, Kashmiri weaves and embroidery, among others.
 
 Before presenting each collection, the craft was explained in brief, with details of its origin. “Fabrics are an integral part of architecture and therefore, Archiprix 2017 is a good platform to showcase traditional Indian textile crafts before world renowned architects,” shared Gauri Wagenaar, committee member, CDS Art Foundation.
 
 Engaging local communities from Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh to create a line of garments, designer Padmaja Krishnan collaborated with Sally Holkar, the founder of WomenWeave Charitable Trust, and presented her collection at Walking Hand in Hand. “The philosophy of walking hand-in-hand goes with ours because at WomenWeave, we’ve engaged women from marginalized sections right from harvesting cotton crop to processing, spinning, weaving and turning it into fabric,” said Holkar.
 
 Padmaja, whose collection, ‘Light of the Sun’ was presented, said, “I’ve been working with WomenWeave for a long time now and the idea is not just to support these communities but also to come up with a contemporary line of garments.”
