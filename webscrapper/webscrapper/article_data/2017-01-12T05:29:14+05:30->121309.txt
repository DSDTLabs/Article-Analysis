GANDHINAGAR: Even as the deadlock over Goods and Services Tax ( ) continues between the Centre and the states, Union finance minister   said on Wednesday that he hoped the issues of conflict would be settled over the next few weeks.

 The GST council, which has as members the Union FM and the finance ministers of states, will meet on January 16 in a bid to evolve a consensus on the issues of jurisdiction over assessees as well as the taxation of trade in territorial waters.
 
 “Most of the issues have been sorted out, some critical issues remain and these critical issues, over the next few weeks, we will try and solve,” Jaitley said at the Vibrant   here.
 
 Goods and Services Tax (GST), which is to subsume most of the central and state taxes like excise, service tax and VAT, needs to be rolled out latest by September 16, 2017, he said. Under the constitutional amendment passed by   for GST implementation, some of the existing levies would expire after September 16.
 
 The unresolved issues between the Centre and the states threaten to delay the implementation of GST. “We want it to be implemented from April 1, if all issues are resolved. However, it is a constitutional requirement that it is implemented before September 16,” he said. “We are working overtime to make it a reality at the earliest,” revenue secretary Hasmukh Adhia added at the event.
 
 The digitisation spurred by demonetisation will help make the economy transparent, Jaitley said. “This, coupled with GST, will have a combined effect... and accelerate growth,” he added.
 
 Terming GST a gamechanger for the Indian industry, Naushad Forbes, president of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said that the industry was ready for GST implementation if the rules were cleared.
