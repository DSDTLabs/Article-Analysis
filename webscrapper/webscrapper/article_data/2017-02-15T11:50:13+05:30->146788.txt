NAGPUR:   has promised to halve water and   taxes if elected to power in Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). It has also promised to oust private players like water operator OCW and garbage collection company Kanak Resources. The party’s manifesto for NMC polls was released at the hands of former MP Vilas   and city Congress president on Tuesday afternoon.

 Muttemwar and Thakre said that OCW had failed in all respects. “Even now NMC is using about 4,000 tankers to supply water to many areas in the city. Citizens are not getting water supply even for two hours, leave alone round the clock. On the other hand water bills have shot up,” the ex-MP said.
 
 On how cash strapped NMC will be able to afford a reduction in tax revenue, Thakre said, “We will oust OCW and other private players, which are a strain on NMC. Every month the civic agency has to pay them a huge bill. The money thus saved will be used to reduce taxes. We will reduce all sorts of wastage in NMC.”
 
 Slamming chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for the city’s law and order situation, Muttemwar said that a flying squad of ex-servicement and citizens will be constituted in every ward.
 
 Muttemwar trashed BJP’s claims of development. “They have started building cement roads now. What were they doing in last ten years? Now they claim to make Nagpur a smart city. How can this be possible by spending just Rs100 crore per year? This amount is insufficient even for a ward,” he said. 
 
 The ex-union minister charged   with hijacking Congress’ projects. “Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari takes credit for setting up Mihan. The fact is that ex-CM Vilasrao Deshmukh and I had started it in 2002. Metro Rail was also sanctioned by our government in state and centre,” he said.
 
 When asked as to how many seats Congress would win in NMC elections, Muttemwar said, “The   will be from Congress.”
