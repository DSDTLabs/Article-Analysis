At bedtime, a mother was telling her daughter the story of a princess who waited for her prince to rescue her. The daughter instantly corrected her mother, "Why did she wait for her prince? If I were in her place, I would have beaten the hell out of the dragon and rescued myself." A lot of mothers swelled with pride with the little girl's rendition of the age old story. And it is stories like these that are breaking the traditional gender role and shaping women's role as protector and nurturer. 

 
  
 
 To commemorate International Women’s Day, fitness brand   will be releasing its global film “Mom” in India. The video shows a young daughter trying her mom's heels first before getting pulled towards her mother's beat-up, CrossFit training shoes. The comparison somewhere reminds you of the new age women and their continuous fight to break stereotypes. 
 
 Continuing its momentum from last year’s launch of the FitToFight campaign, the iconic movie celebrates womanhood and marks the onset of the second edition of the campaign.
 
 So what will you hand over to your girls this International  ?
