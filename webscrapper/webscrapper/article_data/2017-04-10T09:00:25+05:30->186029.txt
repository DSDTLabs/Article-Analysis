BATHINDA: In the wake of the Supreme Court order regarding no sale of liquor within 500m of national and  , hoteliers in the state have served an ultimatum to the state government to denotify highways passing through the cities by April 11 or else they might shut shop. 

 The Punjab Hotel Association, which represents hotels, bars and restaurants that have licences to  , will wait for the state government response till April 11, failing which the association would hold a meeting on April 12 to decide about the closing down of hotels.
 
 There are nearly 2,000 hotels, bars,   with licences to serve liquor, which have been badly affected by the order of March 31, 2017, said association president   of Bathinda on Sunday. The hoteliers claimed that the closing down of hotels and bars would badly affect the tourism industry. 
 
 Arora further said that, "Although the state government has given an assurance to support hoteliers and those running bars and palaces with licence to serve liquor, it is treading very cautiously and at a slow pace. Already 9 days have passed since the ban order came into effect and we are suffering huge losses." 
 
 He said the hotel and bar owners had deposited the licence fee on March 30 to serve liquor and many of the hotels had even purchased liquor in this context. He added that they had also met Punjab finance minister  , who had assured to work out some solution and "we are waiting for his and the response of the government before holding a state-level meeting of the association on April 12".
