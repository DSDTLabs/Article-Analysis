 The LIFF awards ceremony will be held at Beverly Hills on July 7. Since being founded by Ata Servati - a noted poet, playwright, novelist, prize-winning actor, filmmaker and activist - in 2016, the festival has been able to create a niche for itself. 
 
 "It is indeed an honour. This recognition is especially satisfying as it is from a festival whose goal is to bring the world closer together and promote love and healing through cinema," said director Bidyut Kotoky.
 
 The film, based on true events, narrates the psychological trauma children had to go through during the   Agitation of the 1980s. The film features seasoned actors like Naved Aslam, Nipon Goswami and  .
 
 The filmmaker said 'Xhoihobote Dhemalite' is a semi-autobiographical film. "It is based on the life of children growing up in the Assam of 1980s, those violent times and how that violence affected their life. In this film I'm talking about Assam as I know her better than any other place. But the story of 'Xhoihobote Dhemalite' could very well have been a story of children in a conflict zone from any part of the world," said Bidyut.
