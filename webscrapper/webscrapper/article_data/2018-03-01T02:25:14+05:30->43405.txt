MUMBAI: A 38-year-old Nalasopara man has been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for raping his teenaged daughter and   her. Judge N R Pradhan of the Vasai sessions pronounced the verdict after finding the accused guilty of the crime. 
 
 The accused began abusing his daughter when she was 12 years old. In 2015, when the girl turned 16, she delivered a boy. The girl confided into her mother but the latter asked her not tell anybody about the abuse by her   as he was the only earning member of the family. 
  
 When the abuse continued even after the delivery, the girl approached Tuling police, who arrested the father and booked him for rape under the Indian Penal Code and also under the POCSO Act. tnn
