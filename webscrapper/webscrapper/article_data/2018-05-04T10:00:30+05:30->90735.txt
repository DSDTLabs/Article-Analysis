MANGALURU: Chethana, a first year degree student, is not only excited being a first time voter, but also a proud millennial who believes will be making a big difference in the upcoming assembly polls.

 In Dakshina Kannada alone, 37,999 millennials aged between 18 and 19 are eligible to exercise their franchise for the first time in 2018. The millennials make 2.2% of the total 17,11,848   in the district.
 
 What’s interesting about the new generation voters is that parties are going all out wooing these voters who they believe are young catch. Prime Minister   himself had made an appeal to his party office bearers to attract youngsters through various means including social media.   too is making similar attempts. It recently launched an outreach called ‘Nanna Karnataka’ (My Karnataka) bringing hundreds of college students under one roof.
 
 In Karnataka alone the number of young voters has doubled when compared to 2013. Currently, the state has more than 15 lakh millennial voters registered and it is expected go up when it is time for general election.

 “I am eager to vote for the first time,” said another first-time voter Viroy Moras, a first year degree student. But he is disappointed as he has not received his electoral ID card. “I enrolled in September during a special drive and even after several months I have not received the card. When I checked with the authorities, they said my name was not enrolled in their register,” Viroy said.
 
 Stephen Quadros Permude, a history professor, writer and political analyst from Mangaluru, said when compared to the last few decades, youths are coming out in large numbers to get rid of dictatorial politics. “Their main intention is that they don’t want the history to repeat that once destroyed Germany, where youths were attracted to speeches and eventually led to doomsday. They want 21st century to be of wisdom, intellectual and equal opportunities for all,” he said.
