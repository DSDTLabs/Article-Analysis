MUMBAI:  , which runs the Leela chain, said that it has taken all   to 'vigorously' contest the  's (AAI) eviction notice with regard to its   in Mumbai. The AAI had recently served a notice to the publicly-listed hospitality company for defaulting on Rs 258 crore dues. 

 The chain said that through the legal recourse, it wants to ensure that its rights and options are protected and added that it would be premature for either party to make any definitive statements at this point of time. The AAI had allotted 29,000 sq m of land to Hotel Leelaventure through different agreements. The Leela hotel occupies 18,000 sq m of that land while on the balance 11,000 sq m, it plans to build another property.
 
  "A determination regarding this (the  ) matter can only be made when the full circumstances surrounding the lease arrangements have been addressed under due legal processes," the company said in a statement that was issued on Tuesday.
 
 The Leela Mumbai is a major contributor to the company's revenues and according to the chain's spokesperson, the hotel's operations have not been affected in any manner due to the AAI notice. Hotel Leelaventure has been weighed down by debts of nearly Rs 4,500 crore and has been divesting some of its assets to reduce the same. The company reported a loss of Rs 180 crore on revenues of Rs 661 crore in fiscal 2016.
