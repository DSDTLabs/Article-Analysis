MUMBAI: The first of 14 long weekends this year is round the corner. If your holiday destination involves air travel, then brace for high fares and inconvenient flight timings — unless you’ve already done your bookings.

 For the coming  , tickets on flights with convenient timings are either not available or are expensive. On Wednesday, the cheapest return airfare between Mumbai and Goa for travel on January 26, Friday, and return on January 28, Sunday, was Rs 13,000. But this entails boarding a 10pm flight out of Mumbai and a 4am return flight from Goa. 
 
 For flights with better timings, say a 11.30am, Friday, departure from Mumbai and a 1.10pm, Sunday, return from Goa, fares began at Rs 26,500.
 
  
  
 
 On other routes, like Mumbai-Jodhpur for instance, there were no tickets on non-stop onward flights. Mumbai-Port Blair return fares began at Rs 42,000 on non-stop flights, and Mumbai-Dehradun Rs 32,000. In comparison, Mumbai-Dubai return fares were cheaper, starting at Rs 22,000 for flights with convenient timings or Rs 13,000 for late night or early morning departures. Fares for Mumbai-Bangkok return flights were comparable, beginning at Rs 23,000, but those for flights to Colombo were largely sold out, indicating high demand on the route.
 
 Flying out of Delhi to destinations like Dehradun (cheapest return fare on non-stop flight Rs7,600) or Port Blair (Rs 20,000), despite flight curtailment due to   fly-past, will be cheaper than flying out of Mumbai.
 
 Since Mumbai is served by a lone airport with a congested runway that can hardly accommodate ever-increasing demand for air travel, booking air tickets months in advance will translate to huge savings, as fare trends near long weekends have shown.
 
 For instance, airfares on the Mumbai-Goa route for the next long weekend, February 10-13 (Mahashivratri holidays) have already begun their upward climb, with Rs 9,600 for a return journey with a 5am departure. The cheapest return ticket began at Rs 7,700, but this onward flight departs at 11pm on Friday, meaning a day lost.
