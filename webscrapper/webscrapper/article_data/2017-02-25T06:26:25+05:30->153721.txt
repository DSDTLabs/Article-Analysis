MUMBAI: Most   candidates who won the civic elections got less than 40% of the total votes polled in their wards.

 An analysis of poll data compiled by TOI shows that due to the first-past-the post-system, several high-profile winners have won despite a majority of the electorate in their area preferring other candidates.
 
 Given the low voter base of electoral wards in Mumbai ­ the average is 40,000 -and considering the fact that in most areas polling percentage was between 55-60%, it would mean that many of the winners may have got 10,000 votes or less.
 
 Vishakha Raut, former mayor and MLA who won the prestigious   seat for Sena, received 10,660 votes of the total 29,493 polled at ward number 191, which amounts to 36% of the total votes. The voting percentage in her ward was only 58.73%.
 
 Similarly, former mayor Milind Vaidya, who won from Mahim, polled 32% of all votes, securing 6,899 out of the total 21,515. The voting percentage in the ward was a relatively low 49%. Another such case is that of  , son of Shiv Sena leader Sadanand Sarwankar, who won from Dadar (ward 194) by securing just one-fourth of votes polled. He received 8,623 votes of the 33,595 votes polled in all.
 
 Some say such margins do not reflect the popular mandate. “This is why it is important for more people to come out and vote, because in the absence of large voting, candidates win with small percentages,“ said Anil Patil, a resident of Shivaji Park, who held an awareness drive in his ward to make the election process more participatory.
 
 Senior Shiv Sena leader Mangesh Satamkar, who won from Sion, also secured just one-third of votes polled in his ward: 6,096 of the total17,599. He is a veteran corporator who was defeated in the 2012 elections by a small margin, but has sailed through this year.
 
 Vaishali Shewale, sister-inlaw of Sena MP   too won from Chembur with a vote share of 37% (5,312 of the total 14,151).
 
 Commenting on the victory of such candidates, Sheetal Wagh, a resident of Sion, said, “Despite smaller percentages of votes, they have been elected.Now, the citizens of each ward much get them to work by forming pressure groups.“
 
 Incidentally , the Sena corporator who has won by nearly a landslide is Anil Kokil from Parel. He has the highest vote share amongst all Sena winners. He got 52% of the votes polled in his 204 ward, 13,411out of the total 25,534.
