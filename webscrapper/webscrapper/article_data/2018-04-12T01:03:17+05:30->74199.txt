Trichy: Two girl students studying in class 9 at a government school attempted suicide by consuming rat poison in Perambalur district on Wednesday afternoon. Police said that the duo took the extreme step as they were dejected after being scolded by the hostel warden in front of fellow hostellers. 

 Both the girls hailing from Perambalur district were staying in a government hostel close to the school. On Wednesday, they set fire to the clothes of a fellow roommate assuming them to be old ones.

 Feeling humiliated, the duo consumed rat poison kept in the hostel. Finding them unconscious in the afternoon in their room, fellow hostellers alerted the warden and the duo was rushed to Perambalur government hospital in a critical condition. The girls were still said to be in critical condition and under observation. Mangalamedu police have filed a case in this regard and are carrying out further investigations.
