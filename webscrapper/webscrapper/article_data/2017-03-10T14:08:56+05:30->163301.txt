VISAKHAPATNAM: With at least 25 mandals of Vizianagaram district being badly affected due to   last year, farmers have left their land fallow and not considering any   this year.

 Sources in the   said almost 2.5 lakh acre of land that falls in the dry zone have been left fallow despite the best efforts of the agriculture and horticulture department to have the farmers plant summer crops. They further added that almost 97 per cent of farmers in the district come under small and marginal groups due to which aid from the government is inadequate.
 
 Apart from these factors, MNREGS is also hurting the farmers during the planting season, many of them whom used to grow lentils as dry crop during the summer season. A farmer from  , GS Naidu said, “I grew close to 60 tonne of sugarcane per acre in the last two years. However, today, despite the soil being rich in nutrients and adequate water, I’m not growing the crop because it has become extremely difficult to find labour due to MNREGS.”
 
 Sugarcane is planted in the months of February and March in north coastal AP and as a result of MNREGS, many farmers are opting out of it. In the drier zones closer to Vizag district, the culprit is chiefly the weather. Farmers are is dependent on rain water and last year’s northeast monsoon left many farmers high and dry.
 
 A farmer from L Kota mandal P Surrappa Raju said, “I have given up on agriculture and will simply take to orchards in the coming years as the whole process has become extremely taxing and unyielding. The labour problem is unmanageable and the government only seems to be creating more problems through the MNREGA by implementing it at a time when there is urgent need of farm hands.”
