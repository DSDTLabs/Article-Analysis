On Tuesday, the ensemble cast of  , featuring  ,  ,  ,  ,   and Sobhita Dhulipala shot for a wild and wacky song, an impromptu addition to the film. 

 Delhi Belly writer  , who is making his directorial debut with the satirical comedy, was keen on a song that would introduce the characters without revealing their identities and welcome the audience into their mad world.
 
  
  
 
 The story unravels over one night in Mumbai with each character trying to be wackier than the other. "But since the story follows three parallel plots, with Saif and Akshay playing brothers, the lives of many of the characters don't intersect," points a source.
 
 It was choreographed by Adil Sheikh, best known for his song, 'Ladki Kar Gayi Chul' from 'Kapoor & Sons'. Saif shot for it just before taking off to Gstaad with wife   and their son Taimur for a two-week vacation. 
 
 "It features the film's universe and describes the mood of the film with Haryanvi lyrics. And though as unique as 'DK Bose' it doesn't have innuendos. The idea was to keep the narrative of the song unpredictable and all the actors were asked to do what they wished. Each actor is dancing at a different pace," the source further reveals, adding that plans are afoot for an innuendo-heavy number too."
