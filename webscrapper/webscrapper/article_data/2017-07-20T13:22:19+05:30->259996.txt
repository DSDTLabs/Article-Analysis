AHMEDABAD: A three-year-old girl from Afghanistan, Nazifa, can now hear and speak after getting a cochlear implant at Civil Hospital in Asarwa. 

 The   specialist who operated on Nazifa, said she had a bilateral cochlear implant surgery and two artificial cochlea, known as or ‘bionic ears’, were implanted in her skull.
 
  
  
 
  Dr Rahesh Vishwakarma, head of the ENT department at the hospital, who operated on the girl, said that she had congenital profound sensorineural hearing loss, which no hearing aid can help. 
 
 “The girl’s father, Mohammed Dawood Shirzad, an assistant professor of environment science, came here a few months ago to pursue a Masters in Climate Change and Impact Management at Gujarat University. He searched for a cochlear implant centre and came to us. We have been doing cochlear implant surgeries for 14-odd years now, and decided to on operate her so that she can hear and speak,” said Vishwakarma.
 
  
  
 
 
 Vishwakarma further said that the operation was conducted on June 19 and the girl was discharged on June 24. “Because we take one month to switch on the artificial cochlear device, we switched it on two days ago,” he said.
 
 “She can now hear sound and will need extensive auditory-verbal therapy and speech therapy for the next two years, to enable her to learn to listen and speak. She will, in due course, be integrated into the mainstream. She will be able to hear and speak normally and will be able to pursue her passions and studies and will hence be able to live independently,” he said.
