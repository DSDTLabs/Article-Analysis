Vadodara: Baroda Cricket Association (BCA) management has finally decided to allot its official matches to the qualified umpires. The umpires who were being ignored for years got phone calls on Thursday that they will soon be given matches. Sources in the association said that these umpires were supporters of the Royal Group led by Samarjitsinh Gaekwad. 

 The management dominated by the Revival Group was accused of not giving matches to some qualified umpires as they supported the rival group. Three members of the umpiring committee had raised this issue last month during the committeeâ€™s meeting. The members had alleged that umpires who have passed BCCI Level I exams were not allotted matches due to group rivalry. The alleged bias was also said to be affecting the quality of umpiring in the BCA matches. The management had then assured that they will allot matches to all the umpires.
