Nagpur: Passengers of flight no 436 of Indigo Airlines were at the risk of a mishap during landing at Nagpur airport on Sunday evening. The pilot faced a strong glare as a light was focused at the cockpit. This could have hampered the pilot’s vision and even disturbed the landing. Though the plane landed safely, the incident was reported to the air traffic control (ATC) tower by the pilot. Senior airport manager VS Mulekar said a complaint has been filed with the police. “But Mihan India Limited (MIL), which runs the airport, has not received any written complaint from the airlines or the pilot so far,” he added.  MIL is a joint venture between state government’s Maharashtra Airport Development Company (MADC) and Airports Authority of India (AAI). The Delhi-Indore-Nagpur flight landed in the city at around 7.30pm. The pilot reported to the ATC tower through the wireless device that he had faced a strong dazzling light from the right of the approach patch. “It could have been a major risk because as the pilot swoops down, the path has to be visually identified. A strong glare for a long time could have hampered the landing causing a deviation,” said a source. Meanwhile, an Indigo spokesperson said the airlines’ safety team has not received any report on the Nagpur incident so far. The crew reports after all the flights in the given schedule are over. The matter may have not been reported because the crew is still flying. A source said that the light may have come from localities like Shankarpur, Wathoda or settlements near a tony hotel. Police sources said the case is being investigated. It is suspected that the lights may have been used in a marriage function. The rules call for controlled use of any strong light in the area near the airport. Even other obstructions like tall building or trees are not allowed.
