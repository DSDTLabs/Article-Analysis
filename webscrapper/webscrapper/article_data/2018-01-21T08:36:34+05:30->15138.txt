MUMBAI: You can’t get a runner higher in confidence than  . In 2016, he came to Mumbai as a shy youngster. He was the pacer for the super confident   and Kheta Ram. But he went beyond his brief.

 
 Not only did he pace Rawat to a course record, he himself dipped under Ram Singh Yadav’s course record (2:16.59) set in 2012. As a result, all the three qualified for the Rio Olympic Games.
 
 At Rio, Gopi took the game to another level. He managed the best finish by an Indian in terms of timing. The great   finished 11th in the 1976 Montreal Marathon but clocked 2:16.22. Gopi clocked 2:15.25 in Rio but finished 25th. Gopi subsequently won the Asian Marathon title recently.
 
 On Saturday, the eve of the  , sporting a cool stubble, casually talks of setting a course record.
 
 “It is possible though it gets a little hot towards the last 10 kms of the race,” says the Kerala-born runner.
 
 Ask him about Shivnath Singh’s national record (2:12) set way back in 1978, Gopi quickly dismisses thoughts of breaking the National mark in Mumbai.
 
 “We need an earlier start to the race for us to feel good at the end of the race. If we start at 6 am then there is a possibility of breaking the great man’s record,” said Gopi.
 
 The Armyman was particularly pleased with the speed work that he has put in the build up to the Mumbai race. “We would do 20-25 reps of 400m at a speed of 62-65 seconds with one minute rest period. One always feels good about such speedwork.
 
 “If there is anything left, then the competition with Rawat will ensure that we run fast,” says Gopi.
