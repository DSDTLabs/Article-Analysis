Hyderabad: City-based skill development player TalentSprint on Tuesday announced the launch of its ‘SmartCampus’ in the city where it plans to skill 1 around million people in the areas of IT and banking by 2020. Set up at an investment of Rs 5 crore, the SmartCampus will be equipped with a ‘hi-touch plus hi-tech’ model, TalentSprint co-founder and CEO Santanu Paul said. As part of ‘hi-touch’, it will have a capacity to train over 1,000 students in a day (500 students per shift) at its SmartCampus, whereas the ‘hi-tech’ model means, it can reach out to students all over the country via technology. Paul said that of the 1 million, he expects 5% of the students to be trained via the `hi-touch’ model whereas the rest will be trained with the help of technology. Speaking at the launch of the SmartCampus, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) chairman and CEO Manish Kumar said that skilling centres across the country have to work towards scaling up operations as over 10 million students graduate every year in India. Cyient Ltd founder and executive chairman B V R Mohan Reddy said that technology will play a key role in scaling up the skilling endeavours of companies such as TalentSprint as there is a dearth of qualified faculty in the country. IT secretary Jayesh Ranjan said apart from skilling students there is a pressing need to focus on ‘reskilling’ of the existing workforce in many sectors such as IT, where technology is moving at a very fast pace. Meanwhile, AP and Telangana governor ESL Narasimhan said that it is high time to think about what has gone wrong with the education system in the country as a majority of the graduates are not employable.
