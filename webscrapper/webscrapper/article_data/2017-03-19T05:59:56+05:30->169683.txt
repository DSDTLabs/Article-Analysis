AHMEDABAD: Following BJPâ€™s landslide victory in the   polls and the hue and cry by losing political parties on the possibility of rigging electronic voting machines (EVMs), one of the Patidar quota stir leaders, Reshma Patel has moved Gujarat high court seeking use of ballot papers in the upcoming state assembly elections.   ( ) convener, Patel has filed a PIL in the HC through advocate Rafik Lokhandwala and demanded that the state assembly elections slated this year should be conducted though ballot papers only in order to avoid any scope of rigging. She has sought a stay on elections till final outcome of the PIL.

 Arguing that there is a possibility of tampering with EVM, Patel has sought directions to the   (ECI), the state government and other authorities to provide the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system with EVM if it decides to continue with EVM at all. She claimed that this is a necessary step to bring in transparency in polling because paper trail is a convincing proof that EVM has rightly registered the vote cast by a voter in favour of a particular candidate.
 
 She has cited a 2013 Supreme Court order that a paper trail is indispensable requirement for free and fair elections.
