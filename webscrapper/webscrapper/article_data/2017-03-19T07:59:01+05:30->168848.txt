LUCKNOW: On the third day of the probe into the arrest of   doctor, the city police suspended two sub-inspectors, Rajdev Mishra and  , on Saturday.

 Both the sub-inspectors, posted in   police station, were involved in the operation of arresting   from Chennai and getting a fake fraud case registered against the doctor.
 
  Manzil Saini also initiated a case against the inspector of Aliganj police station. Despite repeated attempts to contact the SSP, he remained unavailable for comment. Meanwhile, other senior officials, including ASP (trans-gomti)   avoided questions on the issue. A delegation of TN doctors have submitted a compliant to Saini, on behalf of Gayatri, wife of Dr Sudheer, on the basis of which the case against the errant cops will be probed.
 
 Meanwhile, Chennai-based Dr Sudheer, who was released from jail in Lucknow, heaved a sigh of relief. 
 
 Dr Sudheer said on February 24, police arrested him. “My wife used to receive calls from money-lender M.Kamraj, threatening that I would remain in prison forever,” he told TOI.
 
 He also alleged that that the duo Chaurasiya and Mishra kept demanding cash and tortured him by confining him into a secluded place in Aliganj at the behest of Sarfaraz. “They called my family and demanded Rs 50 lakh,” said Dr Sudheer.
