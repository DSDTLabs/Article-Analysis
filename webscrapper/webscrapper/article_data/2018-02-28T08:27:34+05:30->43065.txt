"Being at the Academy was my first opportunity to work within a global development network, coordinating schools with the same objectives and vision but with very different geographies and student cultures," said  , head of the Academy. "To grapple with the challenges of setting the same high standards in different contexts is very rewarding," he said.

"With AKDN helping over 8,500 students nationwide through rural and urban education programmes, one can only strive to increase these numbers in order to increase the impact of quality education in India," he said.
