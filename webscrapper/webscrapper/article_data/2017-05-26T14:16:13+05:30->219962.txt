NEW DELHI: At the 1999 ICC World Cup, the Indian cricket team was struggling after losing to South Africa in their opener and then crashing to a stunning three-wicket defeat to Zimbabwe.  Under the captaincy of Mohammad Azharuddin, India were in dire strait. It took Sachin Tendulkar hitting an emotionally-charged century against Kenya, a day after the legend returned having cremated his father, to give them some hope.  And when India met defending champions Sri Lanka at Taunton on May 26, 1999 the situation was almost a must-win scenario. Sri Lanka in 1999 were a far cry from the Sri Lanka of 1996. Most glaringly, they seemed unaware of how to adapt to overcast conditions and skiddy surfaces where going over the top inside the first 15 overs wasn’t as easy as in Asia. And it was at Taunton that they most famously fell apart, oddly enough on the most batting-friendly track of the tournament. Sri Lanka's bowlers were erratic and Sourav Ganguly and Dravid tore them apart en route to a world record partnership of 318 in 45 overs, at the time the best alliance in ODI history. Ganguly's 183 in 156 balls, whose last 83 runs came in just 39 balls, was the second best for a World Cup and India’s total of 373/6 the second best in ODIs. Dravid was in sublime form as he reached his second successive century at nearly a run a ball. He finished on 145 from 129 balls, having hit 17 fours and a six. It was sublime batting, and Sri Lanka were never in with a chance once their openers were out inside five overs. Arjuna Rangatuna’s side was all out for 216 in 42.3 overs, with seamer Robin Singh claiming 5/31.  With this loss, Sri Lanka were eliminated from the tournament. India beat England in a rain-hit game to enter the Super Six stage, where defeats to Australia and New Zealand knocked them out.
