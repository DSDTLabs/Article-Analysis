Panaji: Differences between some Socorro residents over a road widening work in the village turned ugly on Sunday, leading to around 250-300 villagers landing at the Porvorim police station. Based on their demands, three complaints were filed against activist Wilbur Ticlo and his NGO team.

 This was hours after Ticlo lodged a complaint that while he was returning home, he was restrained and threatened with dire consequencies by “a tall person” near the hill-cutting site at Carrem. Policemen accompanied him to the site as he complained that his way was blocked by the contractor. 
 
 The police said this angered some villagers, as Ticlo had earlier too objected to the road widening work involving hill-cutting. A group of villagers gathered at the site, and the fight then moved to the Porvorim police station, with the group demanding a FIR against Ticlo. The complaints were filed alleging that Ticlo abused the contractor Mustaq Ahmed and threatened Socorro sarpanch Sandeep Vazarkar. As per the third complaint, one of Ticlo's associates, allegedly manhandled a labourer at the site.
