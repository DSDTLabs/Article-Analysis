MUMBAI: The state is looking at hiring over 100 officers to aide the   to act as custodians of the large tracts of land donated by Muslim philanthropists for the betterment of their community. 

 At present, there are only 38 officers to protect them from encroachment. According to official estimates, nearly 70% of the wakf board land is encroached upon due to lack of manpower to protect the prime land reserve. 
 
 "There is only one person in the wakf board to man the entire Konkan region. This is how poorly the board is equipped," said an official. A separate board was formed in 1995, earlier Wakf properties were governed by the charity commissioners office, which has a staff of 800 people. The state has also proposed to give Rs 9.5 crore for the salary of this staff for five years.
