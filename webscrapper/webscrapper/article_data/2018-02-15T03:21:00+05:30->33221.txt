Panaji: Crime branch of Goa Police on Wednesday arrested accused Ravikant Yadav in Karwar in connection with a   case in North Goa coastal belt last year.

 In August 2017, the Crime branch had arrested a team of contract killers hired to eliminate Gajendra 'Chotu' Singh, a UP native who operates restaurants in Goa, over a financial dispute. They managed to foil the murder bid. 
 
 The crime branch had retrieved 6 country-made pistols and 26 live bullets from the hotel rooms of the hired killers. 
 
 The contract to kill Gajendra had been given out by UP native Ravikant Yadav, and Gajendra's erstwhile business associate. tnn
