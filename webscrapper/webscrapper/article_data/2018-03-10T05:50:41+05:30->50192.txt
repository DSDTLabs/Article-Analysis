HYDERABAD: Friday's mathematics paper came as a shocker for students taking their intermediate second-year examination, with 60 per cent of the questions appearing for the first time in the last five years. Given the level of difficulty, experts said that the pass percentage of students - particularly those who are average or below average - could witness a significant drop this year. 

 "So far, there have been no surprises as all of them have been in line with previous years' question papers. In Friday's paper, however, most of the questions were concept-based and very different from other years," said D V  , dean, Telangana Intermediate Education, Narayana Group of Institutions.
 
 This was seconded by other experts as well. "Usually, 35 per cent of the questions in a paper are tough, 35 per cent are moderately difficult and the remaining are easy. While this pattern has been followed this time as well, the fact that a majority of the questions were unfamiliar to students increased the difficult level,"said   P, president, Government Junior Lecturer's Association. 
 
 Agreeing with their lecturers, students said that they had to skip certain questions in the paper because of the same. Some even said that they were unsure if their answers to several questions were correct or not.
 
 "Though I attempted all the questions, I cannot exactly say if they are right or wrong. In fact, I was surprised to see the question paper as not many questions were familiar," said Akshita V, an intermediate student. 
 
 Meanwhile, 46 students were caught copying on Friday during their Maths, Zoology, History (Paper II Examination) exams, from across the state. While 3,35,508 students registered for the  , a total of 11,237 remained absent.
