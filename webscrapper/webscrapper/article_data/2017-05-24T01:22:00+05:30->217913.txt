Thane: Could the 20 tonnes   worth Rs 2,000 crore seized after a   be   off, wondered Thane district sessions   on Tuesday.

 A special court was hearing the police application to dispose of the ephedrine stock seized in a raid from   Pvt Ltd in  . The court said this after the prime accused, Manoj Jain, pointed out that ephedrine has medicinal properties, said special public prosecutor Shishir Hiray. He pointed out that the FDA has cancelled the firm’s licence and even the police were investing “manpower” in guarding the seized goods, which has no commercial value. “We will follow the SC guidelines and involve agencies like NCB and CBI, and carry out its destruction,” Hiray told the court. The court reserved its order for the next date of hearing. Hiray also sought a proclamation from the court against accused Vicky Goswami, an international drug baron, and actress Mamta Kulkarni as co-ps have exhausted all legal provisions and even served warrants to no avail. —Nishikant Karlikar
