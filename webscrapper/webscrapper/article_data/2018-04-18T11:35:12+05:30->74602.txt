LUDHIANA: The condition of Yashwant alias Bobby, a  , remained critical in a private hospital in Ludhiana, after he received a bullet injury on his head in a violent clash between Dalit and right-wing groups on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway in Phagwara on Friday midnight.

 Tension had started to brew after Dalit activists led by Ambedkar Sena put up a hoarding at Gol Chowk, which is on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway, late in the evening to name it as Samvidhaan Chowk on the occasion of Dr Ambedkar’s birth anniversary. However, Hindu groups — including different factions of the Shiv Sena — objected to it, and converged near the chowk, demanding the hoarding’s removal.
 
 Even as the police negotiated with both the sides for a couple of hours, both the sides came face to face just before midnight and started pelting stones. Gunshots were also heard, and two Dalit activists received bullet injuries. Dalit leaders alleged that Hindu leaders fired at them, and that too when the police were present.
 
 Giving details about the latest condition of Yaswant, Dr RK Kaushal, professor and head of Department of Neurosurgery — who heads the team of doctors treating Yashwant — said the patient’s condition remained critical. He added that a bullet had entered his head from one side, and after causing damage to the brain, had come out of the skull (but stuck in the skull bone) from the other side, but remained under the skin.
 
 One of the doctors in the team said they were waiting for the patient to stabilize, before they could remove the bullet. He added that Yashwant had not shown any signs of improvement. Meanwhile, the hospital’s spokesperson said Yashwant remained on life support system in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital.
