MUMBAI: The slightly decomposed bodies of a 29-year-old   and her eight-year-old daughter were found in their fourth-floor flat in   on Saturday under mysterious circumstances.

 Police suspect that  , a  , and her daughter, Hetavi, a class II student, were strangled and are looking at a love affair angle. 
 
 The murders came to light after residents of Sonam Saraswati building, Golden Nest, Bhayander (east), found foul smell emanating from flat No. 401, which Deepika had rented in September after separating from her husband, Kartik Sanghvi, a real-estate agent in Mira Road. As the flat was not locked from outside, the residents alerted   around 11.30 am as well as Kartik and Deepika’s mother, who lived nearby. 
 
 The police, who opened the door with the help of a locksmith, found Deepika’s body in the living room. Even as the family thought Hetavi might have been kidnapped, police found her body wrapped in a mattress and stuffed in the storage of a bed in the bedroom.
 
 Residents told police three-four men had been visiting Deepika’s home in the past few days and their images have been captured on the CCTV camera . They said Deepika, who worked in a call centre in Mira Road, rarely interacted with neighbours. 
 
 Police said that on Friday, Deepika's mother had gone to Hetavi's Madhusudan Global School in Bhayander to inquire about her. The school told her Hetavi did not turn up after January 26. And on Friday night, Kartik visited Deepika’s rented flat after calls to her went unanswered. He even enquired with some residents who said they were not aware about the mother-daughter’s whereabouts. The couple had a love marriage in 2008 and separated in February last year. Kartik had promised to give her Rs 5 lakh for the care of his daughter.
 
 The bodies have been sent for postmortem.
