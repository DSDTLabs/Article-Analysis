CHANDIGARH:   government has decided to enhance the powers of city magistrates and gave them the responsibility of district urban affairs officers to ensure better coordination and faster execution of development works in the urban areas. A proposal to this effect has been approved by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.

 Haryana urban local bodies minister   said on Saturday that the decision would do away with the technical issues involved in solving matters between municipal corporations and municipal councils and facilitate direct communication with the headquarters.
 
 The technical problem caused for want of direct administrative control resting with municipal corporations and municipal councils has been solved on the pattern of panchayati raj department. The way district development and panchayat officer holds the responsibility of coordination and control in his department, the city magistrate has been given same responsibility in the form of district urban affairs officer, Jain said.
 
 In keeping with the Haryana Municipality Services Act, 2010, deputy commissioners have been ensuring compliance of all necessary directions regarding municipal areas through local fund branch in their office. But due to non-availability of liaison officer in the office of DC to deal with matters related to municipalities, people were facing difficulties since long, she added.
