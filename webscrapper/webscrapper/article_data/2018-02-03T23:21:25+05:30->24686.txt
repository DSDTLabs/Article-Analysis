There is no denying the fact that actresses   and   are two of the prettiest faces in   and when they take took the centre stage as showstoppers for two notable designers at a fashion event in Mumbai, the audience was spellbound. While Yami was the face of a ‘care and concern’ themed compilation, Kriti closed the show for a larger-than-life collection on galaxies — outfits made for evening wear without women feeling too heavy and exhausted. 

 Dressed in a white and black sari that had intricate Kashmiri handwork on it, and a back-brushed hairdo, Yami exuded charm and elegance of a princess. Kriti, too, looked every bit a queen in her blingy pink-purple structurally draped lehenga. Both the ladies agreed that they were completely bowled over by the outfits they got to showcase on stage and thanked the respective designers for making them feel like modern-day princesses. In fact, Kriti was asked if she would similar clothes on her wedding day, to which, she playfully replied, “Whenever that day comes, the costume bit is taken care of (laughs).” When asked if she is a romantic at heart, the former model-turned-actress said with a smile, “I am a Bollywood kind of romantic at heart.”
