The students of IIM-Calcutta still draw inspiration from the institute’s alumnus, Malli Mastaan Babu, who went on to climb the five highest peaks in the world. Their mountaineering and trekking club, Armageddon, is a product of that inspiration. And this year, 19 members of the club trekked to the   base camp to create awareness about trekking and environmental conservation.
Altogether 21 students started planning for the trip in February and learnt that the ideal time to trek on the route is March. So, they got very little time to plan and execute the trek. But they nailed it. Starting from Kathmandu, they trekked for 13 days and covered over 140 km. While 19 went to the Everest base camp at 5,400 metres, seven went on to   (5,683 m) and seven, to Nangkartshang (5,100 m). Two students couldn’t complete the trek as they fell ill. “During the trek, we walked for eight-nine hours every day and stopped over at small villages at night. It was magical,” Amit Kohad, a team member, told us.
 The food was primarily dal, rice and boiled potato, but no one complained. “After nine hours of walking, we used to be so hungry that we could eat almost anything,” said Amit, adding that they usually used to camp in small villages and interact with the locals and learn about their lives. 
 Apart from Amit, Akshay Agarwal, Yash Agarwal, Priyanshu Chouskey, Akshay Rohan Gojare, Shahina Jindal, Akash Kumar, Siddhartha Lakkaraju, Drumit Patel, Mandar Patil, Priya Raghuram, Sonali Dev, Deepak Vishwa, Vimanyu Verma, Vaibhav Arora, Abhik Bhattacherjee, Rutuparna Pramod, Arvind Karunakaran and Nur Kumar Sreshta completed the trek.
 And for seven of them, the best part was climbing Kala Patthar, which is adjacent to Mt Everest. They started from the base camp at 3.30 am and reached the peak just in time to see the sunrise. “It was an experience of a lifetime,” Amit said with a smile.
