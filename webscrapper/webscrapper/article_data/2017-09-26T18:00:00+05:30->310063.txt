Given that the debate on nepotism in Bollywood has been going on for a while, we asked ' ' director   and producer   there view on it. David said, “It is easier for an industry boy to get opportunities, but in the end, you need talent to survive. Also, all of us are outsiders. I struggled for 10 years before my films started making money. Sajid, too, has seen bad times till ' ' and 'Judwaa' happened. Let me tell you, I haven’t helped my sons Rohit or Varun professionally. I got to know from a third person that Rohit is making a film. Same with Varun — he doesn’t want to take my help.   came to my house to inform me that Varun will be launched in his film. Rohit and I were surprised that he was going to be a hero. If Varun didn't have to go through the kind of struggles that I did, yeh uska muqaddar hai. The difference is, I had a poor father, Rohit and Varun have a rich father (laughs). Of course, Karan ki film ho gayi isliye, varna mujhe usse launch karna hi padta. I am his father, after all. But he was destined to make it on his own.”
Sajid Nadiadwala reasoned, “What do I do if my son wants to be an actor? Should I tell him that he is not supposed to be one because of nepotism? This word has cropped up recently. You have girls like Jacqueline Fernandez and Katrina Kaif who are not from here; Akshay Kumar is also an outsider. Also, every industry kid has a father who has struggled. Look at Davidji, I still remember he had a scooter for the longest time jo kabhi chalu hi nahin hoti thi.”
