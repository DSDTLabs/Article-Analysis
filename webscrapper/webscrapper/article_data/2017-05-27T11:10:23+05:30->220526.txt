CHANDIGARH: Eyeing the   (IIT) status for better facilities and independent funding, the   of Technology submitted a fresh proposal to UT administrator   Badnore on Friday.

 PEC director   said the administrator had agreed to discuss it with the Union ministry of human resource development.“The proposal gave him a comparison between our present academic and administrative system and what it can be if we get the IIT status,“ he said. “This status will make us a global brand and help us draw tier-1 companies to campus placement.“
 
 On March 9, Badnore had asked the institute for a draft proposal. Arora's presentation in response talked about revamping the campus. The 12th Five-Year Plan envisages central status for several higher education institutes (HIEs) from Union Territories. PEC University and the Chandigarh College of Architecture (CCA) are among these institutes with a potential for upgrade.
 
 The presentation to the administrator suggested that as one of the oldest institutes in the region, PEC University deserved to get the IIT status for better grants and infrastructure.
