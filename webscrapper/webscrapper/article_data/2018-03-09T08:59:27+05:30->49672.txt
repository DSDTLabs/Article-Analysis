CHARMINAR: Two ancient cannons that were found stashed near a graveyard in   were inspected by the state archaeology department officials on Thursday. 

 While one of the cannons was found next to a discarded car with garbage strewn all around it, another was found just outside the graveyard along the fortified wall that was built by rulers in the past to provide security.
 
 The existence of one of the two cannons, which was discovered by children residing in the area, was reported in TOI recently. After this, the archaeology department sent officials to inspect the area. But to their surprise they found not just one but two cannons in a state of neglect. 
 
 "We were surprised to see that there were two cannons. Both have been inspected and we also took pictures for our reference," said G  , city monuments in-charge, department of archaeology and museums.
 
 "We will definitely do the repairs and see that both these cannons are protected. The exact plan of action will be decided once we discuss the matter with our director," Rajender said, thanking TOI for helping them find the cannons. 
 
 A month ago, while digging to lay the foundation for a house in   near  , the workers stumbled upon what appeared to be a tunnel and found a cannon and a few cannonballs inside. "These are very interesting finds and the government should make sure they are well protected for future generations," said  , co-convener of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.
