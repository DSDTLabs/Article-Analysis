He delivered the lecture on ‘Exploring nature at the large Hadron Collider moments after the Big Bang’ and presented the talk on how the universe came into existence.

 With the participating institutions including Panjab University, BARC, TIFR, Mumbai, IISER, Pune, IIT, Chennai, SINP, Kolkata, IISc, Bangalore among others,   said the country’s participation in CMS has been growing. 
 
 He gave a detail of the research programme going on at CERN, Geneva with the Large Hadron Collider experiments linked with the discovery of   and discussed the physics being studied with the CMS experiment at CERN and participation of physicists from Panjab University. He elaborated that how the outcome of the research at CERN is able to benefit the society, particularly in the field of medicine and communication. He also discussed the future studies to be done with the CMS detector.
 
 The family of Prof H S Hans, which is supporting the annual H S Hans Memorial Lecture, also instituted the Hans ‘Innovation Award’ for the students of physics department to praise their innovative projects carrying potential of going into production mode. 
 
 The award for the year 2018, carrying an honorarium of Rs 25,000 has been shared by three students, Malkeet Singh, Rahul Sachdeva and Gurneet Kaur. The three students have developed smart industrial automation system based on internet of things (IOT), smart stick for blind people based on ultrasonic sensor, GSM and GPS and 3-D robotic control and cost-effective ozone generator. The award will help the young students to materialise their new ideas and innovative work at an early stage which will lead to their growth as entrepreneurs.
