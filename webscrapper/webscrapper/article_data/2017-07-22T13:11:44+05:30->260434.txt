SIVAGANGA: A 31-year-old woman   was found murdered in a secluded place in   in   district. Police suspect the role of another goatherd, who has gone missing, ever since the murder took place. They suspect the woman could have been murdered due to dispute in grazing at a particular area.

 The victim was identified as D Lokambal, 31, from   near Poovanthi. She was married and had three children including two daughters. Police said Lokambal left her house along with the goats to graze them in a nearby tank in the locality.
 
  The woman, who left in the morning did not return in the evening. As it was well past the usual time, her husband Davamani, went in search of her. As she could not be found, he informed other villagers who too joined in the search.
 
 Police said Lokambalâ€™s body was found packed in a gunny bag and thrown in a secluded place in a tank in Enathi. Immediately, local police was alerted. A team rushed to the spot, recovered the body and shifted it to Tirupuvanam government hospital for postmortem. Police said there were as many as 11 cut injuries in various parts of the body.
 
 Meanwhile, a sniffer dog was brought to the spot, which ran towards Muthumani, a goatherd. As he was missing, police suspect that he could have murdered the woman. 
 
 Investigation revealed that there was a pending dispute between the woman and the man in sharing the grazing field.
