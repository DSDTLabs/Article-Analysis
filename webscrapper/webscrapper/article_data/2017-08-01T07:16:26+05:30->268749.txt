AHMEDABAD: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s brother –  , president of the   Fair Price Shop Owners and Kerosene License Holders Association, again warned of agitation on Monday and said fair price shops across the state will close down from September 1, as their various demands are yet to be considered by BJP-led Gujarat government.

 Modi on Monday said that fair price shop owners had earlier in May given ultimatum of a month to the state government, but the food and civil supply minister did not pay any heed to their demands ranging from getting nod to sell gas under   to availing financial assistance for their children's higher education.
 
 “The government took 2.5 months instead of our ultimatum of one month and it did not take any step so far. Therefore, all fair price shops will remain shut from September 1 onwards until the government accepts our demands,” said Modi.
 
 Modi alleged that the state government has been forcing them to cheat poor people and it is them which has been pushing fair price shop owners into the role of thieves. Modi had earlier warned of agitation in May, but after government’s assurance he had called it off.
