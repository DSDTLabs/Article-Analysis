AHMEDABAD: In a bizarre incident, the body of a youth bearing minor stab wounds and bruises on the arm was found in the   area of  , on Friday afternoon. Police did not find a weapon at the spot. A woman had called the police control room and said that a youth was killing himself with a knife in the Bungalow area of Sardarnagar. The calling phone was then switched off. This caused police to be uncertain about whether this was a suicide or a cold-blooded murder. According to police sources, local police and teams from crime branch had rushed to the spot, only to find the body of 30-year-old Amrut Solanki, a resident of   in Naroda, at the spot.

 “There was a shallow stab wound to the chest and few bruises on the arm. Blood was still flowing out of his nose when we reached the spot, which suggests that not too much time had elapsed. The blood from the nose points to a head injury and subsequent haemorrhage,” said a senior police official.
 
 Police officials said they are examining Solanki’s call records. “Solanki used to work at a nearby food joint. We are questioning other employees there,” added a senior police official. Police sources said the family of the victim is in shock and could not speak to them. “We suspect a love affair or personal enmity could be the reason for his death if the cause of death is not suicide. We are also tracking down the woman who had called up the police control room,” said a senior police official.
