PATIALA: Three months after being set up to probe irregularities in the  ,  , the two-member committee, constituted by vice-chancellor B S Ghumman, started its investigation finally on Monday.

 Panel members Jagjit Puri, a retired IAS officer, and V K Kapoor, a retired IPS officer, were appointed by the V-C to look into inquiry reports into alleged scams. But only Puri reached the university on Monday.
 
 It is learned that 16 inquiries have been divided equally between the two committee members. Puri spoke to the senior professors who were appointed as investigators into the alleged scams and had submitted their reports to the V-C last year.
 
 Puri looked into reports of the three alleged scams on depositing EPF and ESI money for universityâ€™s outsourced employees, recruitments of candidates on basis of fake SC and BC certificates and purchase of a software.
 
 These senior professors were appointed as investigators by the former officiating V-C Anurag Verma last year who took charge after Prof   resigned after the Congress government came to power in   in March 2017. Jaspal had remained the V-C in the university for around 10 years during the previous SAD-BJP rule.
 
 In a brief interaction with the media, Puri said he would submit his report within the stipulated time and refused to reveal anything else. Prof  , who had submitted inquiry report over EPF scam, said investigators were called instead of those who are facing allegations of embezzling the university money.
