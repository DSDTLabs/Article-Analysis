MAPUSA: A woman from   was arrested by the Anjuna police on Saturday for filing a false   complaint against a Thane-based businessman.

 “We have made the arrest in a 2016 alleged rape case following investigation in the case based on the complaint filed by the rape accused,” Anjuna PI Sanjay Dalvi told STOI.
 
 Police said that in February 2016, Tulika Katare, 24, had filed a fake rape case at the Anjuna police station against Kishore Keswani, 56, a builder and hotelier from Thane. 
 
 In her statement, Katare said that Keswani had taken her to a hotel room in Anjuna under the pretext of giving her a job and raped her.
 
 Keswani applied for anticipatory bail in March 2016, which was granted by additional sessions court, Mapusa, police said.
 
 In a counter allegation, in October 2016, Keswani filed a case against Katare and 11 others for filing a case against him based on   allegation. In his complaint, Keswani said that the allegation against him were aimed at grabbing his property and extorting money for him and were as such baseless as he was in   at the time of the incident.
 
 Police sources said that a study of the CCTV footage collected by the Goa police from Keswani’s house in Ulhasnagar, Thane, verified that Keswani was at his residence at the time of the incident. The builder’s mobile phone details also suggested that he was in Mumbai at the time of the alleged rape, police sources said. 
 
 Police sources said that the Keswani’s DNA reports were negative in the alleged rape case and that the hotel staff where the alleged incident took place also did not identify him during an identification parade.
 
 “Katare has been sent to seven days police custody by JMFC Mapusa,” Dalvi said.
