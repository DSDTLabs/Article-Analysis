PATNA: A special NIA ( ) court of special judge Manoj Singh in Patna forwarded the three ISI suspects to 14 days’ judicial custody in Beur jail on Friday. The three — Umashankar Patel, Motilal Paswan and Mukesh Yadav — were allegedly involved in planting a cooker bomb on the railway tracks near Ghorasahan station in   district and Indore-Patna Express derailment near Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh. They were brought from Bettiah district jail.

 Sources said the NIA has moved the court to get them on remand for two weeks. “NIA has also filed a petition seeking their two weeks’ custody. The petition will be heard on Saturday,” said the source adding that the special NIA court has sought case diary.
 
 The three were arrested on January 13 in connection with the murder of Deepak and Arun Ram, whose bodies were recovered from Nepal’s Bara district on December 28 last year. The three were arrested after Nepal police nabbed one Brijkishore Giri, who was working for ISI agent Shamshul Huda, a Nepalese based in Dubai. Two more Nepalese, Mujahir Ansari and   alias Sujeet, were also arrested by Nepal police for allegedly killing Deepak and Arun, who had failed to detonate the cooker bomb at Ghorasahan.
 
 During their interrogation, they confessed to their involvement in the Ghorasahan incident on October 1, 2016 and the Kanpur train accident in December last year. 
 
 Sources said once the NIA gets the trio on remand, they would be taken to Kanpur and other places related to the recent train accidents.
 
 Sources said the three have been kept separately in high security ward, also known as solitary cells, in Beur jail where ten Indian Mujahideen members accused in   and Bodh Gaya blasts cases are lodged.
 
 After East Champaran police and state rail police, NIA is the third investigating agency to take the trio on remand.
