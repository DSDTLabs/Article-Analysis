PANAJI: In a bid to understand   and predict climate trends, the   and   (NCAOR) has expanded from the Antarctic region to the southern oceans, arctic region and the  

 “The idea to see if it (rising temperatures) can be predicted and if actions can be taken to either retard the process or stop the process, though I don’t think we can stop it. We also want to study if it is a natural phenomenon that is beyond control or whether it is because of human contribution,” NCAOR chairman   said.
 
 Beg was talking to TOI while announcing that the institute was organizing a national conference on polar sciences on May 16-17, at Vasco.
 
 With concern over warming oceans and melting glaciers gripping policy makers and research scientists, NCAOR, an autonomous research and development institute, that reports to the ministry of earth sciences, has begun to track patters in the arctic, southern oceans and the Himalayas.
 
 “I don’t deny we are doing research in other parts. The scientists felt that we are studying climate, but the information is incomplete. Unless you study both the poles, you cannot have the teleconnections for the monsoons, because both the poles control the cold winds which come up from Antarctica and the warm winds that warm the oceans,” Beg said.
 
 NCAOR also has a permanent research base ‘Himansh’ in the Himalayas since 2016. “Himalaya happened because there was a lot of research on melting glaciers and since NCAOR had the competence and capability to work in the antarctic region, with antarctic glaciers and the arctic region, we decided why not work in the Himalayas also,” Beg added.
