The annual budget presented by the Bruhat   Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) for 2017-18 aimed at improving the overall quality of life of the average Bengaluru citizen. From a renewed thrust on road infrastructure development, to improving solid waste management system, and realising the   proposal made by chief minister  , the proposals made in the   sought to address the many woes plaguing the city. No new taxes, and tax revisions were announced, brining much cheer to the citizens.

 Many proposals in the civic budget reflected the promises made by the CM in the budget he announced last week. The outlay of this year’s budget is Rs 9,247 crore, a 35% increase compared to last year (Rs 6,823 crore). Experts, however, dubbed the sum an inflated figure. With a large chunk of the funds expected from the government (46%), experts are sceptical if the civic agency will be able to fulfil all its promises, despite the BBMP expecting Rs 2,681 crore in tax revenue.
 
 The budget was presented by  , chairman of the standing committee (finance and taxation). As expected, a bulk of the outlay has been earmarked for development and maintenance of the road network (Rs 4,118 crore), while Rs 898 crore has been allocated for solid waste management.
 
 Defending the budget, Gunashekar said, “I have tried to be very realistic. We are confident of fulfilling our demands, with the help of the government, and by meeting our revenue targets. The CM has earmarjed Rs 3,891.36 crore in the state budget for the development of the city, and we intend to utilise the sum for our schemes and projects.”
 
 Tax rebate for parties who build public parking facilities
 
 Lack of parking facilities is a problem that plagues most localities of the city. In a bid to address the problem, the budget has proposed to take up development of hi-tech facilities under the public private partnership model. “Private parties willing to construct public parking facilities will be eligible for tax rebate,” read the budget book, which ran into 60 pages.
 
 No parity in fund allocation: BJP
 
 The BJP, which is the opposition in the BBMP council, alleged disproportionate allocation of funds in the budget. BJP corporators also claimed that the new super specialty hospitals announced in the budget were in Congress-ruled constituencies – BTM Layout, Shivajinagar and Sarvagnanagar.
