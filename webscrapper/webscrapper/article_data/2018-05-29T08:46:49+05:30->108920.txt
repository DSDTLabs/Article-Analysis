 'Seharkhwaan' is the term used for the drum beaters who go around a locality to wake up its residents for the pre-dawn meal before start of dawn-to-dusk fast during Ramzan. 
 
 This task is normally taken up by one of the Muslims from the locality but members from minority community doing it is rare but not new.
