NEW DELHI:   travelling on Delhi Metro’s   (HUDA City Centre-Samaypur Badli) had a   on Friday morning, as a   paralysed   for more than an hour.

 Most of the busy stations on the corridor, such as Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate, Central Secretariat, Vishwavidyalaya, witnessed chaos as the crowd kept increasing with the trains getting delayed by up to half an hour. The major problem at the corridor was between 11.30am and 12.30pm.
 
 “Due to signalling issues at interlocking stations of Rajiv Chowk, Kashmere Gate and Vishwavidyalaya, trains were manually given routes from 11.30am to 12.04pm. This caused little bunching of trains on Line 2 during this period,” a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) spokesperson said. He added the signalling issue was rectified and normal services were restored soon.
 
 Commuters, however, claimed there were huge delays on the corridor with trains packed with passengers almost crawling between stations.
 
 “Trains were arriving after a delay of half an hour and the Rajiv Chowk metro station was choc-a-bloc by noon,” said Ravinder Ahuja, a commuter. 
 
 Commuters said that trains were arriving after a gap of around 20 to 40 minutes, leading to massive overcrowding at the stations and in trains. “The trains arriving were already full. There was lot of pushing and shoving to get inside the trains,” said Ahuja said.
 
 “Even after the train started moving, it was extremely slow and stopped at every station. It took me about 50 minutes to reach Central Secretariat from Rajiv Chowk — a journey of five minutes,” he added.
 
 “The Rajiv Chowk station had become extremely suffocating and many passengers were feeling restless, while many children were crying due to the melee,” said Vineeta Sharma, another commuter.
