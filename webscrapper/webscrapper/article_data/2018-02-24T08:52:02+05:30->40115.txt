CAPE TOWN: Every time South Africa’s wicketkeeper-batsman Heinrich Klaasen has been at the crease, he’s looked threatening enough to take the game away from India, whether in the One-dayers or T20 International series, the last of which will be played here at the Newlands Cricket Ground on Saturday.

 
 Klaasen’s knock in the second T20I, alongside JP Duminy’s equally crucial contribution, not only gave South Africa a much-needed win to stay alive in the series but also gave India a lot to think about regarding their rotation of bowlers.
 
 India, however, do not believe the Klaasen-Duminy stand, in any way, ended up denting their confidence going into the all-important last game. “I don’t think (SA’s aggressive chase has pushed India back).
 
 We have done really well as a bowling unit. Sometimes you need to credit the opposition as well,” India’s new No. 3 in the 20-over format,   said.
 
 The left-handed batsman, who is back in India’s scheme of things post a successful domestic stint, says South Africa had no choice but to come with something different in order to counter the visitors. “They needed to do something different else when Kuldeep and Chahal were not allowing them to score. They needed to come up with plan B. They did well but it is not like we didn’t,” Raina added.
 
 “When you look to target the first six overs in T20s, you have to play your shots. Sometimes you get runs, sometimes you don’t. (But) You need to take chances in the first six overs when you are looking to chase or get big runs.”
