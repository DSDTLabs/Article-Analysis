New Delhi:   in India can now get 10 MB of free data every day, thanks to  , a Boston-based mobile internet startup.

 Jana, which raised $57 million from   last year, ran its   app earlier, through which users could earn free mobile data for trying out sponsored apps. The sponsors pay for the data and Jana takes a commission. To make the process more seamless, Jana has launched its mCent browser, which works on a similar principle — only this time, users would not have to try out sponsored apps.
 
 “Our aim is to reach one billion people,” said  , founder & CEO of Jana (meaning a person or people in Sanskrit). “It’s saddening to see people with   phones keeping their data switched off.”
 
 Jana added 10 million users in India last year, taking its user base in India to 30 million. With the new browser, it aims to add another 10 million by the end of this year. Surprisingly, the company, does not have any users in the US. 
 
 Eagle says around half of its users worldwide are from India. 
 
 “By 2020, people will pay more for data despite the price of data coming down across markets,” Eagle told TOI. “Consumption is going up by 6x by 2020, so even if price per megabyte is going to halve, the amount of money internet users are going to spend on their data connection is going to go up by 3x.”
