 “The marriage which is alleged to have been performed is a sham and is of no consequence in the eye of law. It is therefore declared null and void,” the judgment said.
 
 The court also directed police to conduct a comprehensive investigation of the case and activities of the organization that allegedly aided in conducting the marriage.
 
 The woman was doing her internship after completing BHMS in a college in Salem,  . The father alleged in his petition that two Muslim sisters who were her roommates converted her to Islam and took her to Sathyasarani, a Muslim organization, and kept her under illegal detention. He alleged efforts to recruit her to Islamic State by marrying her to a   of Manjeri and taking her to Syria.
 
 The girl denied that she was under illegal detention when produced before the court. The high court had earlier directed the state police chief to ensure that the woman was not taken out of the country without its permission.
