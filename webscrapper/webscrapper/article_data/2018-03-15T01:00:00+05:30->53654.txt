Director Raj Kumar Gupta’s ' ', starring   and Ileana D’Cruz, is based on a true incident — a series of income-tax raids that took place in the 1980s in Lucknow. 
On how he went about penning the film’s story,   reveals, “Once   agreed to do the film, screenwriter Ritesh Shah and I met people who were connected with the incident, including the officer who had conducted the raids. We spoke to many IT officers because we needed to understand how the department functioned back then. Research and detailing were important for this film.”
 
 While Ajay essays the character of the IT officer, Amay Patnaik, Ileana plays his wife. The director adds, “We needed a good performer with an innocent charm to play Amay’s wife and felt that Ileana was perfect for the role. Since there were no mobile phones, social media and internet in the 80s, and the IT raids were not widely reported in the mainstream media, the wives of these IT officers wouldn’t know where their husbands had gone or for how long they would be away. They had to be brave and supportive towards their partners. We even met a few IT officers’ wives to know their side of the story.” Admitting that times have changed, he points out, “At that point in time, if you conducted raids in a place like Lucknow, it was very dangerous. Today, on the contrary, if there is a raid, it will immediately be on social media.” 
 
 Recalling how he gained the trust of the income tax officer on whom the film is based, Rajkumar says, “My body of work helped me a lot to win his trust. It is very important for the subject to be narrated in a responsible way. We involved the officer in the creative process. However to follow responsible filmmaking and respect the privacy of the individual, we were extremely careful about keeping his name under wraps.”
