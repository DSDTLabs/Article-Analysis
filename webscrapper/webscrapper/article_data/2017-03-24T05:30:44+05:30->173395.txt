BHANGAR:   in the neighbouring blocks of   within a span of four hours has triggered a political   in the city's backyard. 

 Hours after local CPM leader Salauddin Haldar (55) was shot at and hacked to death on his way back home from his daily namaaz at Mathurapur's Ranaghata village, miscreants waiting by the wayside shot at Bhangar Trinamool leader Ohidul Islam near Kanthal Beria Bazar while he was coming back home on a motorbike on Wednesday night. 
 
 SSKM doctors performed a surgery and removed the bullet. Senior Trinamool leaders Sovan Chatterjee, Abdur Rezzak Molla and Arabul Islam visited him on Thursday morning.
 
 CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra blamed Mathurapur Police for not taking steps even after Haldar sought security against Trinamool toughs. Islam denied the charge accusing Naxalites and CPM of murder bid. CPM district secretary Shamik Lahiri held that Ohidul is a victim of Trinamool's own factional rivalry. CPM leader Kanti Ganguly too said Haldar has been the Trinamool's target for long.
 
 Mayor Sovan Chatterjee rubbished the charge that the attack was a fallout of the recent Bhangar stir.
