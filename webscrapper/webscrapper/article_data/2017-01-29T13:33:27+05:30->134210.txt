 McConaughey said he was desperate to be involved with a family film because he realised he hadn't starred in anything for years that was suitable for his children to watch.
 
 McConaughey has three children, sons  , eight, and Livingstone, four, and seven-year-old daughter Vida with his wife Camila Alves, and he made the decision to seek out an animation while watching a film with them but he had to wait four years for a part to be offered to him. 
 
 In an interview, he said, "I got tired of answering the question, 'So what film have you made that is your kids' favourite?' I looked at my last 10 years and I hadn't really done one that they could see. So I'd watch animated films with them, and I was like, 'You know what? I want to make an animated film, do some voice work.' 
 
 "Nobody was hiring me for about four years and then I got a call. It's a lot of fun, it's easier than live action."
