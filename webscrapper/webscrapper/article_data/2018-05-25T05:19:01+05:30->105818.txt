NEW DELHI: A day after reporting a substantial Q4 FY 18 loss of Rs 1,040 crore, Jet Airways’ share plunged 7% on BSE Thursday. While the market was up almost one per cent, Jet’s scrip closed at Rs 391.55 (down by Rs 29.6) after touching its 52-week low of Rs 376.6 during intraday trade. The airline had on Wednesday declared Q4 FY 18 loss of Rs 1,040 crore as opposed to a profit of Rs 583 crore in same quarter of previous fiscal. For FY 2017-18, Jet group reported a loss of 636 crore versus a profit of Rs 1,499 crore in FY 17.

 
 After these numbers,   CEO   wrote to employees Thursday saying: “Sadly, for the first time in the last 12 quarters we have reported a quarterly loss of Rs 1,040 crore. This quarterly loss was larger than the cumulative profit we made in the first three quarters, giving us a loss of Rs 725 crore for the full year. Although we can attribute a portion of this loss to the continuing increase in the price of Brent fuel, our rationalization alone does not improve the financial health of the company.”
 
 “We must find ways to combat this increase in the price of fuel with mitigating revenue and cost ‘tactics’. I call it ‘tactics’ because our fundamental strategy does not need to change, it’s the urgency with which we implement our strategy that we must accelerate. As an example, our strategy calls for us to ‘create a competitive cost structure’ and the current circumstances dictate that we must find tactics with which our cost reduction can be accelerated. For 25 years we have shown a resilience to overcome one challenge after another and we will once again find a way to do this as a team,” his mail added.
 
 Due to increased price, Jet Airways spent Rs 2,063.3 crore on aviation turbine fuel ( ) in January-March 2018 — up 30.5% from Rs 1,581 crore in same quarter of previous fiscal. The airline is banking on its orders of the fuel efficient   737 Max. The airline has ordered 150 of these planes and will get the first B-737 Max in a few days.
