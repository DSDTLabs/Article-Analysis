  :   in the state was a matter of concern but the home (police) department had taken steps to combat it,   informed the assembly on Tuesday, the eve of International Women's Day. 

 "The government has passed an order that all cases of heinous crime against women and children should be transferred to fast-track courts," he said in reply to a special motion moved by opposition MLA Paul Lyngdoh to discuss increasing atrocities against women and children in the state.
 
 The state government had also notified the anti-human trafficking units in four districts to be extra vigilant, the home minister said, adding that a plan to build more such units to cover all districts was in the pipeline.
 
 "The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and Operation Muskaan, initiated by the Union home ministry to trace missing children, are being implemented in the state," he said.
 
 "All SPs have been requested to investigate job placement agencies," the minister said. "They have also been instructed to take steps to check infiltration of foreign nationals in the border areas," he said, adding, "A cyber crime assistance cell has been set up at the CID headquarters."
 
 Admitting the enormity of the problem in a predominantly matrilineal society, Lyngdoh referred to leader of opposition Donkupar Roy's observation in the house that   had surpassed even Uttar Pradesh in 'per capita' crime ratio. "Unless the problem is dealt with, this will have an impact on the flow of tourists in the state and its economy," he said.
 
 Since 2013, 700 cases of rape have been reported in the state but the rate of conviction has been quite low. "Incidents of rape and molestation have become common," Lyngdoh admitted.
