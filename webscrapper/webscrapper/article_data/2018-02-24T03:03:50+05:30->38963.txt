 Hundreds of curious visitors came to see the artwork on Friday. A selfie point for the crowd has been set up, and there’s also an astronaut cutout for people to pose with. 
 
 Voice recordings from previous moon landings played in the backdrop. “It looks quite real and that’s why it caught my attention while I was crossing the road. I had to click a picture for my friends,” said Kshitij Saxena, a student.
 
 British Council has brought the installation to mark the last phase of the UK-India year of culture. The installation is half a million times smaller than the real moon and is at an approximate scale of 1:5,00,000 with each centimetre of the internally-lit spherical structure representing 5km of the moon’s surface. It also glows like the real moon. 
 
 “For eons, the moon has impacted society and culture. It has been worshipped as a deity and used as a timekeeper. Before gas lamps and electricity, the moon was the only night-time source of light. Living in cities illuminated by electricity, we have in many ways become disconnected with the moon. I hope this project restores that sense of wonder, inspires questions and reconnects people with the night sky,” said Jerram.
