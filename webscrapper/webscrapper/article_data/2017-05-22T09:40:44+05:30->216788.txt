NEW DELHI: When it comes to reaching the   by road,   is ranked higher only than Chennai among the Metros. And despite the addition of several new airports across the country, accessibility remains a problem, a recent study by the School of Planning and Architecture has found.

 At 29 km/hour by car and 24km/hour via public transport, Indian airports lag global standards (52km/hour and 64 km/hour, respectively) in terms of average journey speed.
 
 The study, conducted by Amal Jose from SPA and titled Benchmarking of Accessibility and Connectivity of Indian Airports, analysed parameters such as air connectivity, ground accessibility, reliability, access travel time and speeds of the influenced networks.
 
  ranks highest in terms of average journey speed in Metros to reach the airport with Delhi a lowly sixth. Overall, Delhi ranks 60th. Hyderabad averages a speed of 35.1 km/hour, but people trying to reach the airport in Delhi can only manage an average speed of 20.1 km/hour due bottlenecks on the way. 
 
 “As there are no benchmarking parameters for Indian airports, it is important that we fix these for improving the overall level of service. The government has announced different policies of UDAN to improve connectivity. A similar policy needs to be adopted to classify airports into different tiers, ranging from mega hubs — which will include Delhi and Mumbai — to   and regional hubs,” said Sewa Ram, professor, Transport Planning at SPA.
 
 According to the study, Delhi secured the fourth rank among Metros in terms of access by road, but an overall rank of 60 in terms of reliability. Shillong was first on the reliability index, followed by Aizawl and Goa. The study further pointed out that a journey from the city centre (Chandni Chowk) to the airport may take anywhere between 31 and 76 minutes in Delhi.
