AHMEDABAD: On Tuesday, the annual board meeting of   Corporation Limited (SRFDCL) turned fiery. 

 The row began when  , one of the nine directors of the company, demanded a copy of the annual audit report. Kumar alleges that he insisted that the company secretary make note in the minutes that the audit copy was not provided to him but this was not done. 
 
 “How is it that a director’s observation on the SRFDCL board is not noted in the minutes. I will drag the board to court if they refuse to be accountable to the public,” Kumar said. 
 
 Kumar was shocked to learn that the audit report, pertaining to the Rs 1,300 crore project was never provided to opposition leaders. 
 
 “No opposition leader, since 1997, had ever been provided a copy of the audit report, despite being entitled to them. A multi-crore project, funded by the taxpayer, was never accountable to the public. The total cost of the project till 2014 was Rs 1,152 crore,” Kumar says. In May 1997, the AMC launched SRFDCL as an special purpose vehicle under Section 149(3) of the Indian Companies Act, 1956. SRFDCL was provided a seed capital of Rs 9 crore. The SPV model was used to avoid the delays associated with municipal decision-making.
 
 “Eight of the nine members on the board are either elected, appointed or government employees paid by the government for the job. How can they be not accountable to the public. This is a sham,” said Sharma. The board of directors comprises of the chairperson of SRFDCL, AMC municipal commissioner,  ,  , the mayor of Ahmedabad, chairman of the standing committee of the AMC, leader of opposition in the AMC, the collector of Ahmedabad and the deputy municipal commissioner (Finance).
