 A majority of parents are agitated with the teams formed by Vadodara district education officer (DEO) who are asking the parents to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of 2016-17 till the time fee regulation committees (FRCs) decide over the fees that private schools can charge.

 Later in the day, parents of two city-based schools including Shannen Kids School and Baroda High School, Alkapuri had a meeting at band stand in Kamatibaug wherein a majority of parents decided to intensify their efforts to make the bandh call of January 12 a success. 
 
 The parent groups have decided that they will themselves approach other parents requesting them not to send their wards to schools on January 12 to make the state wide bandh call against managements of private schools a success. 
 
 A group of parents also raised concerns on the way in which the DEO teams are holding meetings in different city-based private schools under the garb of “explaining the provisions of the Act”. 
 
 Parents complained that details of the schedule and timings of such meetings are not shared publicly with all the parents ahead of such meetings at private schools. 
 
 “It seems as if the DEO teams are giving an opportunity to school managements to call only those parents whom they can influence so that there is no objection or voice of dissent raised against their wishes,” said a parent.
