NEW DELHI: A fortnight after a man was shot while returning from the Rohini court, his family members have told the police that they are being threatened by gang members of Jitender Gogi. 

 Relatives of   alias Bunty, who was allegedly involved with a rival gang, claimed that ever since the  , several people, including Bunty’s neighbours, had visited their house and told them that they were asked to deliver messages about a threat to the victim’s widow. 
 
 “We have been asked not to pursue the murder case. My sister and their children have been staying in constant fear at their house in Narela,” said Vivek, Bunty’s brother-in-law. 
 
 Bunty’s accomplices, who had been appearing in court along with him, too fear about their life for deposing against Gogi. “We have approached the police for protection, but nothing has been done. We plan to approach senior officers,” said Vivek.
 
 After Bunty was shot near Prashant Vihar, a man claiming to be Gogi’s man Friday had threatened his friend with similar consequences, the victim’s relatives said. 
 
 For years, Gogi and his men have been at war with a rival gang led by Sunil alias Tillu of Tajpur village. Last year, they committed three murders, including that of two rivals, posing as guest teachers. The gang rivalry started in 2013 during the Delhi University students’ union elections.
 
 In 2015, Gogi escaped from the custody of Delhi Police in Bahadurgarh while on the way for a court hearing. Since then, he has been hiding in Uttarakhand and comes to Delhi only to commit crimes. He carries a reward of Rs 2 lakh. Last August, Special Cell had gunned down Jarnail Singh Jelly, the main sharpshooter of Gogi in Rudrapur, Uttarakhand.
 
 Sources confirmed that Gogi’s man Friday, Kuldeep Fajja, has also made it to the top 10 list of most wanted criminals after Bunty’s murder. Coming from Naya Bans near Alipur in northwest Delhi, Fajja is a DU science graduate.
