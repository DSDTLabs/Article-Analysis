PATNA: Even as Union finance minister  , while presenting the   on February 1, proposed redevelopment of about 600 major stations across the country, the fate of the much-ambitious proposal to make all A1 and A category stations world-class, announced in the previous year’s Budget, is still hanging in balance.

 To the surprise of many,   was not included in the plan when the   decided to revamp 23 stations in the first phase with the help of private operators. Railways had invited bids for several stations, but failed to execute the plan for reasons better known to authorities concerned.
 
 Another ambitious plan of the railways to set up a separate   (IRSDC) to give an impetus to station development plan could not be translated into reality so far. Though 12 stations were shortlisted in the first phase, Patna Junction did not find its place. 
 
 Sources Patna, Gaya, Mughalsarai, Dhanbad, Muzaffarpur and Barauni are major stations falling under the jurisdiction of the East Central Railway (ECR), which need to be brought within the purview of station development plan. Even the proposed plan to set up food plazas at the Karbighaiya end of Patna Junction has not materialized so far. 
 
 By proposing to set up IRSDC, the railways had intended to address the issue of “commercial exploitation” at stations. Restaurants, shopping areas and food plazas were to be set up at major stations as per the plan. Railways had earlier requested all states to cooperate with it to develop stations under the IRSDC plan. Ircon International Limited and Rail Land Development Authority were assigned the task to complete the first phase of station development plan, but to no avail so far.
