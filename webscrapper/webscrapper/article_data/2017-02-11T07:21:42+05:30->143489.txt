KOLKATA: If you are a resident of north Kolkata, you don't need to come all the way to Passport   (PSK) in the southeast city for passport processing. You can visit the   (HPO), north Kolkata, for the same. 

 The HPO will double as the PSK of your region. In a bid to expand passport services and to ensure wider coverage, the ministry of external affairs and department of posts (DoP) have agreed to utilize the HPOs across the country as Post Office   (POPSK).
 
 Kolkata was in need of another PSK because of mounting demand of passports. Regional Passport officer (RPO), Kolkata, Bibhuti Bhushan Kumar was also scouting for office space for another PSK in Kolkata. So, the POPSK will help in scaling up the programme of expanding passport services by opening 56 such facilities across the country. Besides, RPO will conduct passport mela to clear the backlogs.
 
 "The pilot projects for this joint venture between the MEA and DOP was inaugurated on January 25 at the   office in Karnataka and at Dahod in Gujarat," Kumar said. "Enthused by success of two pilot projects, we are expanding it further, where passport demand is high," he added.
 
 The MEA and DoP had earlier decided to join hands to deliver passport-related services to the citizens. They are working closely for the early commencement of passport-related services at such 'kendras' located in various states including Bengal, the ministry release said on Friday.
 
 "Once fully functional, applicants who apply for their passports online will be able to schedule an appointment at these POPSKs," the MEA said.
