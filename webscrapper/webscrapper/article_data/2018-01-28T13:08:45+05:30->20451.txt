Nazi dictator   took several decisions under the influence of drugs. He ran short of drugs, which distressed him for days, before he committed suicide. This side of the Fuhrer came up for discussion during the session, ‘Hitler and his Times’, on the third day of the JLF on Saturday.

 Author   and Norman Ohler, who were in conversation with author  , revealed the stories related to drug use and abuse and how it impacted his life. Ohler claimed that Hitler’s vegetarianism and image as a teetotaller were part of propaganda to create an impression of a saintly person concerned only about his country. “Hitler’s personal physician  , who is considered a celebrity in Germany, first met him in 1936 for a stomach treatment. Morell’s first dose gave relief to Fuhrer, making him a trusted doctor,” said Ohler.
 
 He introduced methamphetamine to Hitler which became central to the military life in Germany. Half of Germany was addicted to drugs and it was being sold at grocery stores, said Ohler, who showed an old advertisement of how pharmaceutical giants made it a household item. “Advertisements like that of a mother holding a baby and saying that the drug is the best sleeping aid for babies were popular. The addiction level rose to a point that the people were taking it as they take coffee or tea. 
 
 The book gives a vivid picture of Hitler’s condition in the last days in a bunker,” said Ohler, quoting from his book ‘Blitzed: Drugs in Nazi Germany’. Morell’s notes claim that during the last days, Allied bombing of   had damaged the pharmaceutical firm where the drug was being produced. “Shortage of drug distressed him and two motorcyclists had to ride through the city as bombs were falling from one chemist to another to look for drugs,” said Ohler.
