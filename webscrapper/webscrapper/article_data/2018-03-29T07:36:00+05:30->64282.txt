CHANDIGARH: An “action-taken” report on findings of   — which had looked into alleged wrongdoings in auction of two sand mines to the aides of former minister   Singh last year — has given a clean chit to the politician.

 Prepared by a state government panel headed by chief secretary Karan A Singh, the action-taken report was tabled in the assembly on Wednesday. Even as it cleared Rana Gurjit’s name, the report suggested that provisional acceptance of bids of his aides, Amit Bahadur and  , should be cancelled. Citing findings of the commission, the report recommended no action against the former minister, when it came to the question whether the bidders were acting on behalf of Rana Gurjit for the two controversial mines. 
 
 AAP’s leader of opposition   rued that no discussion was allowed on the report, which was submitted last year. When parliamentary affairs minister   said the report could be debated in the next session,   said it would lose its essence by then. 
 
 On allegations of minister receiving any undue financial benefit from the award of the two mines and influencing the price bid at the time the mines were auctioned, the committee has said, citingthe commission’s findings, that no action has been recommended. 
 
 However, on the bidding process, the report read: “The commission has said that provisional acceptance of bids is not sustainable in favour of Amit Bahadur and Kulvinder Paul Singh; it has been decided to take action as recommended by the committee. The department is in the process of cancelling the provisional acceptance of bids.”
 
 The Narang Commission of Inquiry was constituted on May 30, 2017, under Section 11 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1952, to inquire into all aspects related to sand mining auctions. The commission submitted its report to the government on August 9, 2017.
