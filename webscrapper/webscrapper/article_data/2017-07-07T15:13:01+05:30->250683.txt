Actor   said his jealousy got him into the acting business, when he thought his high school love was going to be snatched away by a fellow thespian. 

  
  
 The 39-year-old actor said he decided to join his high school's drama department when the girl he was in a relationship with was asked to act alongside another student who had written a romantic one-act and was starring in it too.
 
 "I started acting my senior year in high school. I had loved movies since as long as I can remember. Then finally my senior year, I started acting. And I had a girlfriend in the drama programme, and she had been asked to do a one-act by this guy. And he had written this one-act and was directing and starring in it."
 
 "It was this romantic piece, and they were gonna make out in it. And I got really jealous, and I begged her not to do it. But she did it anyway, as she should have. I realise in hindsight that I was jealous probably more because he had constructed this whole thing and he'd written it and directed it and was acting in it - it was, like, all the things that I wanted to do. And so as my revenge, I decided that I would join the drama class,"   said. The ' ' eventually decided to drop out of school to pursue a full-time career in acting.
