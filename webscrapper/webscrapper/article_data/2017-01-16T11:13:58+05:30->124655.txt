THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   employees are up in arms against handing over the   at   SATS (AISATS). 

 The Air Corporations Employees' Union has written to Air India chairman against the move citing the revenue loss the AISATS has incurred after taking the ground handling function at Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mangaluru and Hyderabad.
 
 In the letter written to the Air India chairman, president of ACEU, New Delhi C Udayashankar has pointed out that the revenue from Thiruvananthapuram airport from ground handling activities was Rs 40 crore prior to handing over the charge to AISATS. 
 
 "By handing over the same to AISATS, Air India not only lost the revenue but in addition it is paying huge amount by way of handling charges for its flights to AISATS," he said. 
 
 "There are many cost rationalization measures adopted in Air India including cost reduction in staff expenditure and ban on recruitment but there is no restriction for the joint venture for expenditure and recruitment," he pointed out. 
 
 "The total number of employees in AISATS in Thiruvananthapuram alone is more than 700. It is to be noted that 50% of all the expenditure met by them including the wage bill are credited to the part of the Air India account as per the agreement," the association leader said.
