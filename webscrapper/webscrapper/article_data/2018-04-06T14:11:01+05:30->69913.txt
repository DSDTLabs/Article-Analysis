VADODARA: As re-elections were held in Ahmedabad for the polls of   (BCG) on Thursday, a city-based lawyer who is also one of the candidates complained to the returning officer of BCG against the ‘corrupt practices’ adopted by five candidates from Surat.

 Advocate Dharmendra   in his complaint has alleged that when the polling was held across the state on March 28, a complaint of bogus voting was raised by  , one of the candidates in Surat. After confusion and a melee which even stopped the voting for a while, the polling was resumed after the observer gave 300 to 350 blank ballot papers to all five candidates and asked them to get it voted in their favour.
 
 Parikh has alleged that giving such ballot papers shot the voting percentage to approximately 90 per cent which was 50 per cent until the complaint was raised. In his complaint, Parikh has demanded disqualification of all five candidates.
