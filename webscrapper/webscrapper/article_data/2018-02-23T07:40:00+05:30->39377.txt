Manali: Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) on Thursday launched four electric taxis to connect the township with nearby villages.

 Speaking at the launch function, HRTC regional manager Mangal Chand Manepa said the taxis will connect Manali with Kalath, Kanyal, Vashisht, Hidimba temple, Jagatsukh and other villages. “The fare is nominal, which is very less than the conventional taxis and autorickshaws. Taxis will run continuously on the routes, without any time table. Twenty-five   have reached here, which will ply on different routes,” he said.
 
 Transport minister Govind Singh Thakur said after Shimla, Manali and Chamba, the electric taxi service will be available in all districts. He said the number of taxis will be increased after an update on the service. “Charging points are being installed along all the bus stands of the corporation.”
 
 A large electric vehicle is proposed to connect all villages of upper Manali towards Rohtang with the town. The taxis will not only facilitate locals but also prove beneficial for tourists.
