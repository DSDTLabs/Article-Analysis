 slug: KMC’s special drive from today
 
 Kolhapur: Only 40 out of 173 ‘divyaangs’ (physically challenged people) from the city accepted the cabins provided by the Kolhapur Municipal Corporation (KMC) to set up shops. 
 
 Last year, the civic body had decided to give small cabins to divyaangs at various locations in the city in an attempt to provide them livelihood opportunities. Though the KMC had finalised 173 beneficiaries, only 40 of the applicants have accepted the cabins and started the shops in the past one year.
 
 The civic authorities said some divyaangs objected to the location of the cabins, saying that they were too far from their residences and it was inconvenient for them to travel such distance. 
 
 Mayor Hasina Faras said, “We have appealed the divyaangs to accept the documents of authority for accepting the cabins and start the businesses. “We have started a separate cell to disburse the documents and a special drive will be held on Wednesday and Thursday. The divyaangs have requested to change the location of the cabins; the applications have been forwarded to the estate department and the new locations will be decided soon.”
 
 The KMC is providing the cabins free of cost. As per the plan, the divyaangs will get special vehicles for transport, financial assistance to start small businesses and medical benefits. 
 
 A committee has been set up under the mayor to execute the programme and the beneficiaries were selected through draw of lots. 
 
 “As per the government’s directions, around 3% of the total budget outlay should be spend on uplift programmes of divyaangs. Over Rs 1 crore was allocated in the current year’s budget for the purpose,” said Faras.
