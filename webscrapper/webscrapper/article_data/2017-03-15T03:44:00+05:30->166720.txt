Margao: The sarpanch of Guiridolim village panchayat, Sonia Dias e Fernandes, was voted out of office through a no-confidence motion on Tuesday. 

 The motion was passed 5-0, with two members remaining absent from the meeting held for the purpose. 
 
 Five panch members - Milagres Gonsalves, Balu Ranu Nistani, Vincie Peixoto, Agnelo Caitano Crasto and Maura Sebastiao D’Costa — had moved the motion against the sarpanch on the grounds that she had failed to take them into confidence on various issues concerning the development of the village. tnn
