MUMBAI: A public interest litigation filed in the Bombay HC last week has raised the issues of obstructions on footpaths and the issue of pedestrian safety around Hutatma Chowk or the   area due to   work.

 
 Advocate Neha Philip, who has her office in Fort area, has claimed in the PIL that the authorities have not made provisions for pedestrians in one of the busiest locations in South Mumbai.
 
 A division bench of justices Abhay Oka and   has directed the   and MMRCL to respond to the concerns raised in the PIL by June 8. “No further time shall be granted,” the bench said.
 
 Advocate  , counsel for the petitioner, told the court that pedestrians have to walk right next to construction sites separated by just barricades. “The obstruction of footpaths by illegal barricading and non-provision of safe and adequate alternative passageway is in breach of the statutory obligation of the authorities and the fundamental right of access to footpaths in good and proper condition,” said the petition.
 
 “Undertaking hazardous works adjacent to the remaining pedestrian space without adequate precautionary measures is putting the lives of the pedestrians at grave risk,” claimed the petition.
 
 Work on the   3 is being undertaken in South Mumbai. The area is one of the busiest locations, especially for pedestrian traffic as both CST and Churchgate stations are in the vicinity.
 
 “While the authorities have provided an elevated steel deck for vehicles of one-way traffic to cross over the excavation site, and are contemplating another steel deck for vehicles travelling in the opposite direction, no provision has been made for pedestrians using the footpaths on DN Road,” the petition pointed out.
 
 The court has scheduled the PIL for hearing on June 11.
