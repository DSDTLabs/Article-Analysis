JAIPUR: After failing to auction its grounded  , the   is now banking on the Centre to sell it. It has asked  , a  , to carry out the auction.

 The chopper, which had attracted controversies over the buyback offer made by the manufacturer, had become a headache for the government.
 
 To keep itself away from any further controversies, the general administration department (GAD) has opted to auction it through MSTC.
 
 The company will put the AgustaWestland chopper, AW109E, under hammer through e-auction. However, it will also charge 3% of the sale as commission.
 
 “Being a government PSU, MSTC has better expertise in disposing high-end machines. They have contacts spread globally and networking to sell the helicopter,” said an official.
 
 It would be an open bidding as the option for buy-back has been exhausted. The reserve price of AW109E will remain unchanged at around Rs 13 crore.
 
 The department had made two futile attempts to auction the chopper without luck. The   government then sought a new AgustaWestland 169 helicopter in November under the buy-back plan for AW109E.
 
 However, the deal ran into controversy after two rival manufacturers alleged that the government had framed the bidding in such a way as to favour one firm. Since then officials and the government had avoided taking any decision on its own.
 
 “With the government of India coming into picture, it will now be their responsibility to frame bid documents. The state government will have no role at all,” added the official.
 
 The  , the only one owned by the state government, has been out of service since a clip on one of its rotor blades broke in 2011. In the absence of a state chopper, the government now depends on private operators.
