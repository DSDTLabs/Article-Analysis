PUNE:The new state-of-the-art signage, said to be on a par with those at airports, is being set up at the   station.

 Two boards giving information on the facilities at the station have been put up in front of the new walkway connecting the main entrance to the new second entry and in front of the main entrance, railway authorities told TOI.
 
 “For now 20 boards will come up. The system is world-class and will help passengers to locate all the spots at the railway station. These boards have a brief history of the Pune station written on them,” a railway official said.
 
 The project, implemented in collaboration with the MIT Institute of Design, was earlier expected to be completed by June. “They had presented the design to us, but we wanted some changes. Hence, it got delayed,” the official said.
 
 Another official said, “It has been an important project. Many foreign tourists visit the city and this initiative will help them learn about Pune.”
 
 Passengers lauded the effort. “This was needed badly. With so many people coming here each day, proper signage is important. Moreover, it gives you an insight into the exciting history of the station,” Radhika Jalan, a passenger, said. 
 
 Harsha Shah, the president of the  , said, “Thursday marked the 93rd establishment year of the station’s building. The authorities should have advertised and inaugurated it.
