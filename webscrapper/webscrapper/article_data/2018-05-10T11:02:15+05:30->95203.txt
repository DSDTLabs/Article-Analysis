BENGALURU: Political rallies and roadshows in different parts of Bengaluru left motorists and other commuters stranded in traffic jams for hours on Wednesday.

 
 As   president   participated in a slew of high-voltage roadshows and processions, traffic in Chickpet, Basavanagudi, Shivajinagar, Tippasandra Main Road and Hebbal came to a halt.
 
  president   reached Bengaluru in the afternoon and took part in roadshows in Shantinagar, Shivajinagar, Kammanahalli and Bellandur. Rangappa, a two-wheeler rider, was stuck in Basavanagudi as Rahul’s roadshow proceeded. “Why do police allow roadshows in the heart of the city,” he asked.
 
 “Why should an entire road be blocked just to pave way for a political party to advertise itself,” wondered Radhika Nair, who was stranded near Kammanahalli.
 
 While Rahul was headed in a convoy from Tippasandra to Hebbal, an ambulance was stuck in traffic. Noticing this, Rahul directed police to make way for the vehicle.
