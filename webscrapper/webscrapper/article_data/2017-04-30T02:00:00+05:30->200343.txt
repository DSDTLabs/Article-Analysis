RAXAUL: The ruling parties as well as Madhes-based parties of Nepal are in the process of registering a fresh amendment Bill of the constitution at the legislature-parliament secretariat. The amendment Bill proposes to change boundaries of provinces which the Madhes-based parties have been demanding for long. 

 Sources said more than 20 MPs on Saturday took the forms from parliament secretariat in a bid register their proposals.
 
 Ajay Shankar Nayak, Nepal minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs said the government will endorse an amendment proposal as per the agreement reached between Federal Alliance parties of Madhes region and the government.
 
 Sher Bahadur Deuba, former PM and president of Nepali Congress Party claimed the constitutional amendment Bill tabled in parliament will be endorsed with two-thirds majority even without the support of Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the main opposition party. “The CPN-UML should back the Bill in the interest of the nation,” he added.
 
 Rashtriya Janata Party member Sarvendra Nath Shukla said the revised Bill will be endorsed with the support of some opposition parties. “Madhes parties and government had agreed to revise the Bill for amending Article 274 of the constitution in a bid to change the provincial boundaries,” he said.
 
 Shukla said the Madhes-based parties will not participate in the ensuing local polls if the constitution amendment bill is not passed in the parliament.
