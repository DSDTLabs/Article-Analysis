If you are planning for a wardrobe makeover this  , look out for a few pairs of   — it’s a wardrobe essential in summer. You need to wear stuff that are not too tight and can make you feel comfortable, and therefore, a pair of shorts is the best bet. Now, what you need to keep in mind as you go out to shop are its fit and colour. Also, ensure that you have the right kind of T-shirt and footwear that match the shorts that you buy.

 
 That’s the cardinal rule, irrespective of what outfit you’re going to buy. Comfort is the basic reason for sporting shorts. So, you have to get the fit right, no matter what. A few inches above the knee is perfect. If the hem of the shorts falls below the knee, it makes you appear short and gives an overall lousy appearance. And if you’re slightly bulky, go for shorts that fits you perfectly well. Don’t go for shorts that are bigger than your regular size, thinking it will make you look slimmer. It works the opposite way; it will only make your appearance messy.
 
 
 When we say shorts, the colours that usually come to our mind are khaki, dark grey, black, navy, etc, because that’s what we see most people wear. But if you want to stand out from the rest, go for some refreshing colours. Why not opt for pastel shades or printed ones? There’s nothing wrong in going for a pair of denim shorts, too. 
 
 
 So, if you’re going for denim shorts, play down the ruggedness a bit with a pastel shade collared T-shirt. And for footwear, go for trainers. If you love to have a sporty look and are heading for an outdoor workout session, what’s needed is a pair of sweat shorts. A crew-neck T-shirt and a pair of running shoes will go well with sweat shorts. If you’re someone who wants to look sharp even while wearing a pair of shorts, go for chinos, a perfectly ironed shirt and a pair of loafers or moccasins.
