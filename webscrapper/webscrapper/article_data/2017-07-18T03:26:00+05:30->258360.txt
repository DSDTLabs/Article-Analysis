Panaji: Even a week after tomato prices shot up to Rs 80 per kg, the round reds continue to evade the common man. With wholesale markets in neighbouring states continuing to sell at exorbitant prices, vendors in Goa (who source their stock from there) have had no choice but to maintain the high prices. “Wholesale markets in Belagavi, Kolhapur, Pune and Bengaluru have received poor quantity of tomato produce from farms. This has forced them to hike rates urging us also to maintain the same. There will be no relief until this changes,” said vendor Sadiq Shaikh. TOI had reported last week that poor rain in Maharashtra and Karnataka had led to a serious shortage in crop output. Resultantly leading to the low tomato produce and subsequent shortage. Weather parameters in Goa have also played foul for vendors in Goa. “While supplying freshly-harvested tomatoes to the state, some of the stock got ruined after being hit by rains along Goa’s ghats. Tomatoes unlike onions and potatoes cannot be hoarded and are easily perishable,” said another vendor. They further added that rates will continue to remain high for another fortnight or so. Until then, tomatoes continue to be out of the common man’s reach. Sharing his thoughts on the scenario, agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode said, “Currently, there is low tomato stock in the market available for sale, therefore the exorbitant rates. Cultivation of the fresh crop has begun in June; which takes about 45 days to be ready. Once the quantity of tomatoes increases in the market, the rates will stabilize.”
