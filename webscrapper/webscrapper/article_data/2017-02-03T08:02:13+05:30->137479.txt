 During routine check, Nawabganj police stopped the SUV bearing registration number GJ 01 RF 0006 at the toll plaza at 4am. The vehicle was checked and a bag containing Rs 3.62 lakh was found in it. On questioning the three mahants, police found they were heading to Ayodhya to meet some seers there.
 
 SHO Nawabganj police station Arun Pratap Singh said since the trio could not explain the source of money, they were asked to deposit the cash. Senior officials including SP Neha Pandey reached the spot and the money was placed before the screening committee.
 
 As Uttar Pradesh goes to polls from February 11, people carrying more than Rs 50,000 are required to carry documentary proof explaining the legal source and end-use of cash. The seers could not convince the authorities about the use of money, hence the bag was confiscated. Police noted details of the three seers and let them off.
