MUMBAI:   has decided to continue with road repairs till June 3 as a large amount of work is pending across the city.

 It was planned to complete repairs by May 15 but then an extension till May 31 was granted to contractors. With the civic body still struggling to complete the works it was decided to extend the   again.
 
 BMC said it had informed contractors that if the work not being completed by the deadline, it would withhold their performance guarantee. Almost 30% works is yet to be completed. BMC collects a certain amount as performance guarantee from contractors it appoints to undertake repairs. BMC is targeting completion of 738 road repair works, including 415 project roads, 242 priority road repair works and 81 road works, which come in the defect liability period (DLP) up to May 31. So far, 522 road works have been completed. But civic officials said there are about a dozen works which may continue after May 31, and therefore extended the deadline.
 
 At the civic standing committee meeting on Friday, the Samajwadi Party leader in the BMC said contractors seem to be deliberately delaying work. “The ground reality is very bad, with a lot of work pending, and it is only leading to motorists getting hassled. The condition of roads which come under the DLP is also bad,” said Rais Shaikh.
 
 NCP leader in the BMC, Rakhi Jadhav, said internal roads, used largely by the public, have also not been repaired and are in a bad condition. BJP’s  , a corporator from Colaba, and member of the standing committee panel, said that in the rush to complete road work before the monsoon, sub-standard work was being done, which will again lead to a bumpy ride for motorists this monsoon.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner Idzes Kundan said the work was in progress, and in case it is not completed, the contractor will be held responsible and his performance guarantee will be encashed.
