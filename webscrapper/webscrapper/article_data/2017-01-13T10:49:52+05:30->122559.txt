KOCHI: Former chief minister   has told the   that he used to sign around 60 documents in a minute as the CM and had no time to inspect the documents prior to signing.

 He used to trust officials completely and was not in the habit of inspecting the files prepared by officials prior to putting his signatures on them, Oommen Chandy told the justice G Sivarajan commission. He was responding to questions raised by a representative of All India Lawyers Union before the commission.
 
 Signatures were put at the rate of one per second as such a speed need to be maintained to finish the work as a CM, Chandy told the commission. Further, he said faces of visitors were not remembered by him as there used to be 500-1,000 visitors, with the number going up to between 2,000 and 3,000 during mass contact programmes. It was impossible to remember all of them and Saritha, who is the prime accused in solar scam cases, may have been one of them.
 
 It is due to such high number of visitors that he was not able to recall her face or that she gave representations to him. He came to know about Saritha and Team Solar following her arrest, Chandy said. Further cross examination of the former CM is scheduled on January 30.
