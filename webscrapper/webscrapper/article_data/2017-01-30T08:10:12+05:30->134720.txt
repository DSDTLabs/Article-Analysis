KARWAR: A major accident was averted at Karwar on the   route on Sunday morning, when the power car of Train No. 22476, Coimbatore-Bikaner Express, caught fire at Karwar, near the railway station.

 According to railway officials, the train was running behind schedule due to line doubling work in neighbouring  . The train, which was to reach   at 2.30am on Sunday, reached at 7.15am.
 
 The driver noticed smoke in the front power car attached to the AC bogey of the train while passing through a tunnel, about 1km from the railway station. He immediately informed the station master, and the train, which was to stop at Karwar station, moved slowly as it had neared the destination.
 
 On reaching Karwar, passengers were evacuated from the train, and the first three AC bogeys were separated from the engine. No loss of life or property was reported, nor did any passenger suffer any injuries, railway officials said. Fire engines waiting at the station brought the fire under control.
 
 Railway officials said it was a minor incident and an inquiry has been ordered.
 
 The passengers, though, counted themselves lucky that the fire was noticed when the train was close to Karwar station. “It is fortunate that it happened during the day. Had it been happened at night, when the train was running at high speed, the situation could have been different,“ said a passenger.
 
 Officials said that prima facie, it is not a case of sabotage and the facts will be out only after an inquiry.
 
 The three bogies next to the engine were separated and the train was allowed to continue its journey.
