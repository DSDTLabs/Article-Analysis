MUMBAI: With Union finance minister Arun   announcing around 150 km of additional suburban network for Mumbai at a cost of over Rs 40,000 crore,   is likely to get on track with a token allocation. The project includes elevated corridors on some sections.

 The MUTP III-A, proposed on January 12, comprises the CSMT-Panvel hi-speed corridor, Virar-Diva-Panvel corridor, redevelopment of 16 stations and procurement of 210 AC trains besides extension of harbour line from   to Borivli and laying of fifth and sixth lines between Borivli and  .
 
 
 
  
 
 
 While the project is estimated to cost around Rs 50,000 crore, Jaitley’s mention of Rs 40,000 crore has fuelled speculation that some of the works under MUTP III-A may be have been dropped.
 
 A senior Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation official said, “MUTP III-A will be included in the budget by way of a token allocation of not more than Rs 5 crore. We do not need too much allocation as no work can be carried out unless all the sanctions are received from the railway board, Union cabinet and the state government.”
 
 The official pointed out that even for MUTP III, the initial allocations were Rs 1 crore and Rs 5 crore in 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively, and increased to Rs 411 crore later. “All projects initially get token allocation, but a note in the budget makes it clear MUTP III-A is well on course of execution,” the official said.
 
 Aformer railway official said, “MUTP III-A is like old wine in a new bottle. The bhoomi pujan was to be done on August 15, 2016 but it got stuck in bureaucratic mire. Even the extension of harbour line up to Borivli and more lines up to Virar are being done as compensation for scraping the Bandra-Virar corridor.” Besides, the communication based train control system was to be part of MUTP III but was dropped because of cost. Later, it was included under MUTP III-A, he said.
