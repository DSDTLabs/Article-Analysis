When American playwright Eve Ensler’s internationally acclaimed 
  first hit the stage more than two decades ago, it raised eyebrows. The scintillating episodic play not just unfurled narratives about ‘the forbidden zone’, but it also created a bold new space for women to talk about sexual experiences at various stages in their life. The latest Indian version of the play is set to be staged in Bengaluru soon.

 “The play may have been conceptualized several years ago, but its theme and message still remain urgent. We have tried to give a completely new treatment to the script, with each piece depicting a unique contemporary story and experience. Instead of taking the stage, the actors enact their roles among the audience, making the performance more interactive and conversational,” says director  .
 
 Musical instruments like the djembe, cajón and ukulele add a whole new essence to this humorous play, while the costumes are in black and pink. Three levels of lighting and music transform the performance into a thumping experience. “People’s sensibility and their attitudes towards women are the underlying themes of the play. There is also a transgender piece. Weaved together by a common theme, the monologues shed light on experiences ranging from the inconspicuous to life-altering. Aged between 20 and 53 years, the cast of the drama spans a huge age group — each portraying stories about how women feel about their vagina,” Nishu explains.
 
 Presented by Quiver Productions, the all-women cast of the play include actors Alpa Sood, Charul Kapil, Lavanya Narayan, Sneha Sridhar, Ojaswi Bhattarai, Indumati Das, Anushka Nair, Rachna Chandrashekhar, Swati Vittal, Paridhi Joshi, Kornica Dhar, Julianna James, Khyati Raja, Shatarupa Bhatacharyya, Samanvita Shetty, Champa Saha, while the music is done by Smita. 
  is scheduled to take place at   on March 17 and 18.
