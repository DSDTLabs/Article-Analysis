This was the first time that Shri Shankarlal Sundarbai Shasun Jain College For Women participated at the   Chennai   2017, and the girls came out in full force to show their might at the audition 
  morning. There were over 200 participants, and they showcased their talent in a variety of skills — singing, dancing, rapping in Tamil, karate moves, painting, mimicry and even mehendi art! While Malavika showed us what it is like to do channel surfing, another participant danced and performed to Vadivelu’s dialogue from Sillunu Oru Kadhal! S Darshni’s rendition of Malayil Yaaro, Radhika’s ability to sing and dance at the same time, Heena Jain’s moves to Aaja Nachle and Malini’s rendition of a Korean song won them the 1st runner-up positions. Shreya S’s classical performance, Vidyashree’s steps to the fusion version of Shape Of You, and Aishwarya Sivamohan, Sharadha Baradiya and Annapoorna’s vocal performances fetched them the 2nd runner-up positions.   H was adjudged the winner after she wowed celebrity judge Ashok Kumar with her moves. Ashok, on his part, said, “I’d also like to urge you girls to fight for your rights and not take crime against women lying down. You have the power and strength in you to change the world.”
