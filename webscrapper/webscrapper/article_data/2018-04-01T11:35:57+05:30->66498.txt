PATIALA: Storeroom of a house in   was allegedly set on fire by unidentified accused after committing theft on Thursday midnight. 

 Fire brigade, which was called by the family members around 3am after they rushed out of their house, reached after an hour. The family members thought the fire to be an outcome of a short circuit initially. But, later saw that the goods in their storeroom were scattered all around and their jewellery and costly items were found to be nowhere. The fire also gutted some important documents, they said. 
 
 The family added that the   footage of a shop in front of the house had captured an unidentified man just before the incident took place. One of the family members   claimed that the thieves had first stolen the costlier items including some wrist watches and jewellery from their storeroom and then set it on fire to eliminate any evidence. 
 
 Station house officer at   police station said, "We have registered a case under sections of 380 (theft in dwelling house), 436 (mischief by fire to destroy house) and 457 (lurking house-trespass) of Indian Penal Code against the unidentified accused. The family claimed that the theft had taken place and the thieves set the storeroom of the house on fire. However, we are probing the matter as this might only be a case of short circuit. If anyone is found guilty of setting the storeroom on fire, sections of attempt to murder can also be added to the case."
