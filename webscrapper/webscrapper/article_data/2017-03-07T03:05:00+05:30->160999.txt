Nagpur: Now no development will be allowed 100 metres from the boundary of Lonar lake, the world’s third largest water body formed from basaltic rock due to meteorite impact. Under the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) on February 21, notified the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of 3.83 sqkm Lonar wildlife sanctuary in Buldhana district. ESZ will be spread over an area of 1.92 sqkm with an extent of up to 100 metres all around the boundary of Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary. In November 2016, the lake was notified as part of the sanctuary. However, Rajendra Dhongde, retired divisional forest officer (DFO) and one of those working to save the Lonar crater, said the ESZ limit will not serve the purpose. He said the entire ejecta blanket should have been brought under the ESZ. “The 100 metre limit for ‘no go’ zone is too little. In 2002, the Lonar municipal council had proposed ESZ up to 500 metres from the lake’s boundary,” said Dhongde. Despite meagre ESZ limit, it took nearly 16 months for the MoEFCC to issue notification. A draft notification was issued on November 20, 2015, and objections were invited from stakeholders in 60 days.  The MoEFCC said area up to 100 metres from the boundary has been decided upon from ecological and environmental point of view and after considering objections and suggestions received from stakeholders. Dhongde said Lonar had historic temples and people throng to them for religious yatras there dirtying the area around the lake. “There is a need to check pollution from visitors,” he added. ESZ covers one village. Now the state government will have to prepare a zonal master plan within two years in consultation with local people and adhere to the MoEFCC stipulations.
