RANCHI: Former chief minister   on Thursday demanded a judicial enquiry into the land acquisition process for Adani’s proposed 1600 megawatt (MW)   in  . 

 In a press conference at   (JVM-P) head office in Ranchi, Marandi raised concerns about the water available for drinking and other usages by displaced villagers and job assurances given by the company. 
 
 “If the plant is running on state of the art technology, it will require 1 crore litres of water every day. The population of the area is 13 lakh and they require roughly 30.5 lakh litres of water daily,” Marandi said. 
 
 He added that the Chir River, for which the   Group has signed an agreement with the government for taking water, is the only water source in the area and its use for power generation will spell doom for the people in the area.
 
 The JVM(P) chief also attacked the government’s claims of ample job creation. “A modern day automated thermal plant requires 1,150 people, of which 72% (828) people are technical personnel,” Marandi said. 
 
 “While there is no word about where the technical manpower will come from, only 322 non-technical people from the area can get a job. However, over 3.8 lakh people and 70,000 families will be displaced by this project,” he added.
 
 Marandi questioned the government’s claims that Raiyats agreed to give their lands. “If the landowners have given their consent, then why has the district authority deputed more than 2,000 policemen in the area? The public hearings held on December 6 last year and on March 5 are stage managed,” he alleged. 
 
 He further claimed that policemen had intimidated the villagers a night before the public hearing this year.
