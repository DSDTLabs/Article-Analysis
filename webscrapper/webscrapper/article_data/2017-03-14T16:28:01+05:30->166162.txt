NEW DELHI: The   on Tuesday refused to stay the swearing in of 
    and ordered a floor test in the   on March 16.

 The apex court was listening to a petition filed by the   challenging the Goa governor's decision to invite the   to form government in the coastal state.
 
 A special bench headed by Chief Justice   said in its ruling, "You (Congress) don't have the numbers and that's why you didn't claim to form government... You haven't demonstrated before the governor that number is in your favour."
 
 Dismissing the Congress party's petition, the top court then directed Goa governor   to hold floor test at 11 AM on March 16 and made it clear that the only business of the House would be the holding of floor test after swearing in of the members.
 
 It further directed that all pre-requisites for holding the floor test be completed by tomorrow, including Election Commission related formalities.
 
 The Congress had challenged the invitation extended by the Goa governor to BJP leader Manohar Parrikar to form government, despite emerging as the single largest party in the assembly election.
 
 "As per well-established constitutional norms and conventions, the single-largest party ought to have been given an opportunity to form government and prove its majority," Congress Legislative Party leader Kavlekar said.
 
 The Congress has 17 legislators followed by BJP with 13, Goa Forward Party (GFP) and the Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party (MGP) with three each, three Independents and NCP (one).
 
 On Sunday, the BJP said it has enlisted the support of three members each of the GFP and MGP, besides two Independents to reach the golden number of 21 MLAs needed to prove majority in the 40-member House.
 
 While former union defence minister Manohar Parrikar is scheduled to be sworn in as chief minister by governor Mridula Sinha later today, the Congress is also expected to meet Sinha, demanding to be granted an opportunity for government formation.
