Trichy: To tackle the prevailing drinking water crisis in the city, the civic body has decided to dig deep borewells at 135 places in the four zones of Trichy Corporation at a cost Rs 197.50 lakh. Work is also underway to create nine additional infiltration wells on the Cauvery and Kollidam riverbeds.

 Ten days after it reduced the frequency of drinking water supply to once in two days in the 65 wards of the corporation, the corporation on Tuesday presented good news to its residents of taking steps to dig more borewells and infiltration wells. Corporation commissioner N Ravichandran, in a statement, said that the civic body has taken up the project of digging deep borewells at 44 places in Srirangam zone, 31 places in Ariyamangalam zone, 34 places in Golden Rock zone and 26 places in Ko Abishekapuram zone. The corporation already has 1,764 borewells in the city which are meant for non-drinking water purposes.
 
 The civic body has also started digging five infiltration wells on the Cauvery riverbed and four on the Kollidam for which it has allotted Rs 41 lakh and Rs 30 lakh respectively from the general fund. 
 
 Till July 16, water was pumped to 144 overhead water tanks in the city from 10 wells in the Cauvery and Kollidam riverbeds and 138 mld of water was supplied. However, from July 17 the corporation adopted the alternative water supply method to supply drinking water to the residents once in two days. 
 
 The failure of monsoon in 2016 followed by the decline in storage of water in Mettur brought down the groundwater level in the Cauvery and Kollidam rivers to below 40 foot, thus resulting in the reduction of drinking water supply to 106 mld to the residents. The civic body has so far managed to supply 122 mld of water through contingency measures.
