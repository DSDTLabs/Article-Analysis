PUNE: A garden on NIBM-Undri Road constructed four years ago and inaugurated twice for political mileage is still out of bounds for people because of incomplete construction work. 

 Complaints to expedite the pending work with the   (PMC) have fallen on deaf ears. Local corporator Nanda   has taken the initiative to re-develop the project. 
 
 The garden has come up on 30,000 sq ft on the amenity space provided by a builder adjacent to Konark Indrayu in Kondhwa Khurd. 
 
 Prachi  , a resident of Natraj society said, "The plot was vacant for 15 years. PMC laid the garden but the park is closed for some pending work."
 
 Sharma said they requested Lonkar to attend to the garden. "The grass was mowed and lights were installed. Joggers, strollers and children have started playing in garden. We are waiting for the rain so that the place can be beautified by planting grass and trees," she added. 
 
 Vijay Mainkar, president of Konark Indrayu society, said the NIBM Road Residents' Association had filed numerous complaints to re-open the garden. 
 
 The project gained momentum after the Kausarbaugh-Mohammadwadi ward came under Lonkar. "We have held a series of meetings for planting trees with the garden department. The project will be completed in few months," Mainkar said. Lonkar said they have ordered red and black soils for the garden. The landscaping will be done by architect Dhananjay Solkar. "PMC will spend around Rs 20 lakh on the project," she added. 
 
 Civic officials said the garden was incomplete because of insufficient funds in the annual budget.
