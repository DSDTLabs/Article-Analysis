KOCHI: Mining and geology department has issued   to 44 quarries in the district. 

 According to officials, green clearance has been issued to quarries operating in less than five hectares in various parts of the district, including Aluva, Muvattupuzha, Kothamangalam and Kunnathunadu.
 
 "Currently, 101 quarries with less than five hectares are functioning in the district with green clearance. Among the 44 new quarries, 38 have already started functioning. The opening of six others has been delayed due to legal issues," said  , senior geologist at the mining and geology department, Kakkanad.
 
 Since uncontrolled quarrying will destroy green zone, in 2016, an order by the Kerala high court had stated that even quarries operating in less than five hectares should get environmental clearance for issuance of licence. 
 
 Later, the   also upheld the high court decision.
 
 "Those seeking licence should first get clearance from environmental impact assessment and district environment impact assessment authority and after that a district-level expert appraisal committee headed by the district collector gives the final clearance," said a senior geologist.
 
 "We have issued license after carrying out inspections in quarries various times," he said. 
 
 Meanwhile, quarry owners in the district said that they have to wait for more than a year to get green clearance, and added that it has in a way hindered construction activities in the state. 
 
 "There is a sharp decline in quarry output and rock crushers are unable to work to their full potential. The non-availability of rock has pushed crusher units into crisis. Our tippers used to bring four truckloads of rock per day. But these days, each truck manages to get just one load. The government has to adopt a liberal policy," said a rock crusher owner in the district.
