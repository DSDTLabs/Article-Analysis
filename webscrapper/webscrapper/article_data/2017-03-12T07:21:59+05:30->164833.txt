CHARMINAR: The sale of   in   has dropped by almost 80 per cent, over the last couple of years. Once in great demand, the number of takers for these stoves has now reduced to just a handful, say locals. 

 Reason: non-availability of   in the market.
 
 "The business of kerosene oil stoves has taken a huge hit especially after the arrival of gas stoves. Only a few customers either ask for these stoves or walk in to repair their old ones," said a seller,  .
 
 Predictably, shopkeepers have stopped stacking kerosene stoves in their stores. "With the passage of time everything has changed. In earlier times, many women cooked food on c hulahs. Later kerosene oil stoves took over and now even those have faded away," recalled Anand Kishore, a long-time resident of the Old City. 
 
 The reduced demand has also affected the cost of these kerosene stoves, say shopkeepers. Now there are priced at just 300, even as the cost of gas stoves start from anywhere upwards of 1,000. While a two-burner stove costs 1,000, the price of three-burner   is 15,000. The more sophisticated ones are, of course, priced at 25,000 or more.
