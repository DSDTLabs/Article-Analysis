Udhagamandalam: The Nilgiri Documentation Centre (NDC) has written to the collector, J Innocent Divya, seeking her intervention in stopping tree felling on the Ooty-Kotagiri Road.  “The Ooty-Kotagiri road has been under extensive developmental works for the last two years. However, of late, the works appear to be executed in a hurry without due care for future maintenance. There is vertical cutting of slopes everywhere on the road, which could trigger land slips during the south west monsoon, wasting precious public money,” the letter said. “In the last week, several eucalyptus trees, which are several decades old, were cut down near Kotagiri for no apparent reason. Even trees outside the widening area of the road were cut. The cutters seem to be in a mad rush to complete the felling,” said NDC director Dharmalingam Venugopal. “There is still no conclusive scientific finding to show that eucalyptus is harmful to the Nilgiri ecology and environment. Whatever experiments done so far have only cautioned against indiscriminate use of the tree in sensitive areas. International scientific opinion on invasive species also states that such species can be removed only if their harmful impact is conclusively established,” the letter said. The eucalyptus trees have been in the Nilgiris for nearly two hundred years but the district has been experiencing water scarcity only for the past thirty years, the letter said. “The trees have multiple uses, being ornamental, used as low-cost timber for house construction and sustaining the cottage industry of oil production on which hundreds of poor families depend,” the letter added.
