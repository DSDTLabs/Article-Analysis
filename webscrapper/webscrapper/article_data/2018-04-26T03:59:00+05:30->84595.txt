Gadchiroli: The encounter death toll at Rela-Kasnasur forest has now touched 33 with two more highly decomposed bodies of Maoist cadres being fished out of the Indravati River on Wednesday. The spot where the shoot out took place is along the Maharashtra-Chattisgarh border and near Tadgaon in Bhamragarh tehsil of south Gadchiroli. 

 One of the bodies retrieved was that of a woman. Sixteen bodies were pulled out on Sunday, the day of the encounter. Another 15 were fished out on Tuesday. Out of the 33 bodies, 16 are that of women. This is the biggest success recorded by any security agency against Naxalites in the country. 
 
 On Monday evening, in a village called Nainer, the security agencies had gunned down another 7 Naxalites. As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the Naxalites carried a total reward of Rs1.06 crore.
 
 Also on Wednesday, additional DG (operations) D Kanakaratnam, Naxal Range DIG Ankush Shinde and Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh took an aerial view of the spot where the operation against the Naxalites was carried out.
 
 Deshmukh said the search operations might continue for another couple of days to retrieve more bodies and weapons which might be still stuck in the river bed or away from view beneath the rocks. “Senior officers visited the spot to gauge the situation and how the operation was conducted,” he said.
 
 On Sunday, the combined forces of C-60 commandos from Pranhita headquarters of Aheri taluka and ninth battalion of Central Reserve Police force (CRPF) had cornered around 50-60 Maoists cadres at the foot of three hillocks of Dodrimetta, Kandametta and Addametta on the banks of Indravati River. 
 
 Initially, 16 bodies were found after which the search operation on Monday was called off. After TOI published about 11 more bodies found floating in the river waters, the police department resumed their efforts to retrieve bodies on Tuesday. Some more additional weapons were also found during the second leg of the search operations.
