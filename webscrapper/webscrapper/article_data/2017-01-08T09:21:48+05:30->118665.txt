BHOPAL: Hiding even a small fact while filing  , could land you in trouble. In 2016-17 up to December, there were 183 applicants who tried to hide information and were slapped with fines. 

 The applicants had not filed correct information related to court cases, residential address, marital status and had to cough out a good Rs 20 lakh, said the regional passport officials, during the   held recently.
 
 Within just three days of the adalat held from December 27 to 29, as many as 30 applicants were fined Rs 45,000.
 
 In the three-day Adalat, 450 applicants were called, of which only 244 applicants turned up. According to passport officials, the applications were pending as there were several faults while filling up the forms. Many applications were incomplete, had no documents attached or had suppression of information. Around 46 matters were put on hold and 198 were resolved on the spot. 
 
 While talking to TOI, regional passport officer   said, "Such cases are on the rise every year. Last year also it was recorded between Rs 17-20 lakh. As the process for getting a passport has become much more easier now, we are going even stricter on checking the minute details."
 
 According to Passport Act 1967, there is a provision for fine on the applicants. If the applicant is student, they are fined around Rs 500. If the applicant is not student, then the fine can be anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 50,000 depending upon the gravity of the information suppressed by the applicant.
 
 "If any information remains hidden, the applicant's file is then proceeded after they pay the penalty and if there are some absent documents, then previous file is closed and a new one is filed again," added Rai.
