AURANGABAD: Municipal commissioner   on Monday spoke about the widening of the Jalna road amid speculation in civic circles that he is likely to be transferred soon.

 Asked whether he will be transferred, Bakoria said the order may come between April 7 and 15. “Not only me, but other senior officials may also be shifted,” he said, without elaborating on the issue.
 
 Dwelling at length on the Jalna road project, he told reporters that the civic body has already launched an anti-encroachment drive in the Harsul area, but the residents are demanding that the road width be reduced to 70 feet on each side of the divider, instead of the proposed 100 feet on each side.
 
 “We have decided to consult the public works department (PWD) whether the road width could be reduced,” he said. 
 
 The civic chief said the proposed road — 100 feet from each side — would have a footpath, greenfield and a service road. “Currently, a road that wide road may not be required, but a broad road will be needed in the future.” 
 
 Bakoria said the burden on the Jalgaon road would increase when the six-lane Harsul-Sawangi bypass would come into being. Hence, the civic body would try to reason with the residents to allow the proposed width to avoid inconvenience in the future. 
 
 He said that respecting the residents’ views, the PWD is being approached for opinion. The road is used for reaching Ajanta, which a world heritage site, and is crucial in many ways.
 
 The information technology secretary has organised a meeting at the divisional commissionerate on April 5 to explore the possibility of introducing internet facility in the city, said Bakoria. 
 
 “The state government has already reached an understanding with a US-based company for internet project. Another meeting is scheduled for March 11 to discuss the appointment of special purpose vehicle (SPV) for the smart city project,” he said.
