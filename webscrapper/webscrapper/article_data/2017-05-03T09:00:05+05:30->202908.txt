ERODE: In a gruesome incident, a 60-year-old   and 40 sheep were killed after a speeding tempo traveller rammed and ran over some of them while crossing the Tamil Nadu-Karnataka National Highway near   in   district on Tuesday early morning. The Kadathur police have arrested the van driver. 

 The deceased was identified as K  , of Sulur in Coimbatore. 
 
 According to the Kadathur police, the incident took place when the tempo traveller was returning to Gobichettipalayam from Coimbatore after dropping customers there on Monday night. P Raja, 29, of Gobichettipalayam was at the wheel. "There were no passengers in the van," the police said.
 
 There was a moderate rain when the van neared Kodiveri cross road on the NH at 5.45am on Tuesday. Suddenly, a herd of sheep crossed the road. Taken by surprise, the van driver tried to apply breaks, but in vain. The speeding van subsequently rammed the herd, killing 40 sheep.
 
 The shepherd, meanwhile, attempted to rescue the sheep but he was trapped under the wheels. "The van ran over Marudhachalam and he sustained multiple injuries," the police said. 
 
 Passersby, who witnessed the accident, immediately rushed Marudhachalam to the Gobichettipalayam government hospital. But, he succumbed to his injuries on the way to the hospital.
 
 Following the accident, traffic was halted on Erode-Sathyamangalam stretch for more than an hour. Traffic resumed on the stretch after the police cleared the carcasses of the sheep with the help of local villagers.
 
 Meanwhile, the van driver surrendered before the Gobichettipalayam police. They alerted the Kadathur police, who reached Gobichettipalayam police station and arrested Raja.
 
 During the interrogation, Raja told the police that he could not see the road clearly because of the rain. "He told us that had he spotted the flock he would have stopped the van," the police said.
 
 The police have registered a case and further investigations are on.
