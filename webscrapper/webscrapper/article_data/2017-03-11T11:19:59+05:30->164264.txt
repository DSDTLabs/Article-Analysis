NASHIK: The city police and the civic body are engaged in a passing-the-buck game over setting up of traffic signals at the busy underpass in the   area.
 
 Installation of the signals to reduce the traffic chaos in the area is pending for a year. Civic officials said the setting up of the facility was not a big deal and could be done without much time. “But before that, we want the traffic police to finalise the one-way route. They are yet to do it despite our request,” a senior   (NMC) official said. 
 
 He added that making that zone one-way was decided during a co-ordination meeting involving the   (NHAI), traffic police and the NMC. The official said the civic body will soon convened a meeting with the police and the NHAI to sort out the issue. 
 
 On the other hand, assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Jayant Bajbale that there was no need for any one-way route in the underpass area. “Once the traffic signals are in place with timer facility, the flow of traffic will be automatically smooth,” he added.
 
 The Indiranagar underpass witnesses daily snarls, during the peak hours as vehicles from Mumbai side, Govindnagar side and   take the facility. 
 
 Keeping in mind the traffic chaos, the city police closed the underpass and instructed motorists to take a U-turn to reach the other side of the underpass. Nine months since then, the police buckled under pressure from various quarters and re-opened the underpass in March 2016.
 
 However, as long as the police and the traffic police department do not sort out the issue, the Indiranagar underpass will continue to be a nightmare for most motorists.
