CHENNAI: The spirits have rarely been this low for Chennaiiites. First, the   on   within 500 metres of state and   kicked in on April 1. Then, on Saturday, the district collectorate announced that all Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation Limited (Tasmac) outlets across the city and neighbouring Tiruvallur district would be shut until Wednesday ahead of the RK Nagar byelection. The dry period includes the ban on sale of liquor for Mahaveer Jayanthi. 

 Four days without one's favourite tipple? The thought was enough for multitudes of residents to make a beeline for the nearest outlet to stock up for the upcoming 'drought'. Serpentine queues were witnessed before almost all outlets. Sholinganallur resident Selvam was euphoric as he came out of an outlet in T Nagar clutching two bottles. "The number of liquor shops on Rajiv Gandhi Salai (OMR) have sharply reduced after the SC ban came into effect last week. Since I have to travel all the way to Adyar for the purpose, I preferred this outlet, in the vicinity of my office," he said.
 
 Expecting a deluge of buyers, all Tasmac outlets were filled with adequate stock. Sources in the corporation said the sale in the city was likely to go up by as much as 2 crore on Saturday. The corporation operates about 250 outlets across the city, recording 7 crore- 8 crore daily. 
 
 In a statement, collector E Sundaravalli said all Tasmac retail outlets and bars attached to clubs and hotels should be closed on these days. Tasmac outlets in Tiruvallur will be closed on Tuesday and Wednesday for the byelection as well as on April 15, counting day.
