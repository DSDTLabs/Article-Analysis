Nagpur: While medical experts stated that injuries due to   would occur even before the advent of   or nylon manja, data provided by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)-India shows that there is no end to accidents despite the ban on nylon manja.

 The National Green Tribunal (NGT) banned nylon manja on July 11, 2017. On July 21, a 35-year-old motorcyclist’s throat was slit on the Geeta Colony flyover in New Delhi after his neck got entangled in manja.
 
 On August 16, 2017, a motorist in Chennai suffered a deep cut on the neck due to a manja thread which reportedly had a coating of glue and crushed glass. On December 30 same year, in Kolkata, a 10-year-old girl’s throat got slit by a metal-and- alloy-coated kite when she popped her head out of a car’s sunroof.
 
 On January 5 this year, a 30-year-old man died in Jaipur after his throat got slit by manja. “After the NGT’s ban, nylon manja is not being sold openly in most of the markets. There are very less chances of these accidents being caused by Chinese manja,” said Nikunj Sharma, lead- Public Policy, PETA India.
 
 While the green court stated that nylon manja is non-biodegradable, according to PETA glass has the same properties. “Moreover, there is no scientific way of testing if the manjas being sold have just glass coating or other metals too. If it’s just glass, how are they good conductors of electricity,” added Sharma.
