CHENNAI: The   has obtained approval for a Rs 16 crore project to restore   into a “picnic spot”, a move that has attracted criticism from activists fighting against environmental degradation of the water body.

 Last week, the civic body got sanction for the restoration project from a high-level committee chaired by the secretary of the  . With the exception of an area of 11.5acres (the total area being 36.32acres) belonging to Chennai  , the civic body’s proposal affects the remaining 25 acres of the water body.
 
 “The restoration proposal includes leisure facilities like a children’s park, an adult gym, a walkers pathway, space for an Aavin parlour, a parking lot, multipurpose lawn, playfield and an entrance plaza,” said a corporation official.
 
 However, adding concrete components to a water body’s restoration proposal has attracted the ire of civic activists. “If they have proposed to set up the amenities within the water body holding area, then it is a problem. What is the point of having an Aavin parlour? The intent should have been to recover maximum area of the tank and increase its water holding capacity,” said Haris Sulthan, state body member of social activism group, Arappor Iyakkam.
 
 The group has been fighting a case in the   to recover the tank. “We will challenge (the proposal) if and when the corporation submits the document in the next hearing,” Sulthan added.
 
 Corporation officials said that the restoration would also help recharge ground water table in the neighbourhood, which includes SIDCO Nagar, Padi and   localities. However, locals told TOI that ground water in the neighbourhood is not available even at depths of 100ft.
 
 Officials added that post-restoration the water holding capacity of the tank would increase from 20,000 cubic metre to 70,000. “We need to remove around 84,000 cubic metre of debris from the tank bed to achieve this,” an official said.
