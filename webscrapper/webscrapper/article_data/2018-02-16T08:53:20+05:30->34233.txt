LUCKNOW: The   has created   by effecting another   of an   to his   in less than a month. Rajiv Kapoor, a 1983 batch IAS officer, holding position of secretary, chemical and petroleum, at Centre was repatriated to UP cadre on Thursday.

 While the state had not sought his early repatriation, the reason of his return is not clear. Last month, the Centre had sent back senior IAS officer Devendra Chaudhary, who was secretary in animal husbandry department, even though it had painfully delayed the request for relieving OP Singh after his appointment as DGP.
 
 Chaudhary has been rehabilitated as chairman of the UPSRTC and his retirement is due in June-end. Kapoor, being a member of the senior most serving batch of IAS cadre, will be placed accordingly as he enjoys a clean reputation and is known for integrity. This may lead to a bureaucratic reshuffle in the state after the UP Investorsâ€™ Summit.
