AHMEDABAD: Even with   and   from   by   on the rise,   seem toothless when it comes to curbing illegal moneylending at high interest rates.

 On Tuesday two such incidents came as a shock. A woman in her forties attempted suicide by consuming phenyl in Ramol, and an auto driver Surendra Thakor, 35, of Naroda, who was jobless despite being a BCom degree holder, committed suicide by consuming poison as he was under constant pressure to pay back the Rs 3 lakh he had borrowed at 10% interest per month.
 
 Thakor has left behind a suicide note scribbled on a notebook page of his daughter naming the two moneylenders Praveen Marathi and Nilesh Rabari who had threatened him of dire consequences if he failed to pay the interest.
 
 Ramol police sources said Sunita Verma had borrowed some money at high interest rates. “The loan sharks had seized her shop, which was her only means of livelihood and even threatened to seize her house if she does not repay the interest,” said a local social worker. “Verma could not bear the torture any more and consumed phenyl. While the cops have just taken her application and not registered an FIR, Verma is still in critical condition in LG hospital,” he said.
 
 The victim’s family members said they are waiting for the postmortem report to take action against the loan sharks. It is noteworthy that city police has chalked out a drive to curb illegal money lending business which has led about four to commit suicide during the past one and half months in city alone but family members of the victim claim that no action on the ground is seen against the loan sharks.
