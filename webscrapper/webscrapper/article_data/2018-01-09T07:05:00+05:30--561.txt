Ghaziabad: The probe into the security lapse in the convoy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, when he visited Noida on December 25 to inaugurate Delhi Metro’s magenta line, has been assigned to   police on Monday. SP (city) Akash Tomar has been asked by IG (Meerut Range) Ram Kumar to conduct the inquiry.

 On December 25, the prime minister’s convoy, en route to a helipad near the Botanical Garden metro station from Amity University campus, had taken a wrong turn and driven straight into the stream of traffic on Noida expressway. On December 28, two cops were suspended for the security lapse.
 
 According to sources, the state government had asked UP police for an impartial inquiry and generally, in such cases, the police department of another district is asked to conduct the probe.
 
 “The SP (city) Ghaziabad has been asked to conduct a thorough inquiry into the incident and submit a report. No deadline has been set for completion of the probe,” inspector general Ram Kumar told TOI.
 
 The incident took place between 2.35 pm and 3 pm on December 25 after the prime minister left Amity University to the helipad nearly six km away following his speech. Nearly 5,000 cops were deployed along the prime minister’s route as part of a multi-layered security cordon. The cavalcade was supposed to take the service lane of the expressway but the pilot vehicle drove on to the main expressway instead of taking the left turn. The cops on the pilot vehicle, who were suspended, are sub-inspector Dilip Singh and constable Jaipal.
