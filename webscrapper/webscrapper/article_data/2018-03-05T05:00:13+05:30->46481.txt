KOLKATA: When   extends its network by at least 50km in the next three years, the pressure on Kolkata’s suburban train services is likely to come down,   chairman Ashwani Lohani said on Sunday. 

 While the stretch of the E-W Metro corridor between Salt Lake Sector V and Salt Lake Stadium will be thrown open by October this year, the link will be extended till Phoolbagan by March 2019. By the end of next year, services between Sealdah and Salt Lake Sector V may also start.
 
 “After some delays, construction work is progressing at a good pace. In the next three months, the tunnel boring machines may reach Esplanade from Mahakaran. During our discussions, we have been working out how to increase the pace further. If all goes according to plan, the E-W Metro corridor should be completed by June 2021. The Noapara-Dakshineswar, Noapara-Airport stretches are also going to be completed as per schedule,” Lohani said. 
 
 The cause of concern continues to be the land acquisition for carshed at Joka for the Joka-BBD Bag stretch. According to Metro Railway general manager Ajay Vijayvargiya, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation ( ) has assured that the entire land for the carshed will be made available soon. “At the moment, we are in possession of about 70% of the land but it is not contiguous. Due to this, construction can’t start. At the moment, we have targeted June 2021 as the completion date for the 9 km stretch between Joka and Majherhat,” the GM said. 
 
 At the moment, Railway Board isn’t seriously considering linking the E-W Metro corridor to the airport. According to Lohani, a link to Haldiram’s on VIP Road is at the planning stage but there has been no sanction as yet. The Kolkata (Chitpur) terminus will be further upgraded though with the addition of another building. This station is important as trains between India and Bangladesh run from there. He, though, didn’t paint a rosy picture on the punctuality aspect.
