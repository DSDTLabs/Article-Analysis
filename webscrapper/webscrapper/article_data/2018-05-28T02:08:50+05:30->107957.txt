MUMBAI: A qazi from   who allegedly forged a nikahnama (Islamic marriage certificate) to show that one Sarfraz Khan alias   was married to an yesteryear actress was arrested by the city crime branch.

  A team of cops arrested   (54) from   PRadesh on Friday. “Ansari never came to Mumbai and never meet the actress, so where is the question of him solemnizing her marriage with Khan sitting in a distant place?” said an officer.
 
    has confessed to the police that he had signed the nikahnama for money. Khan was arrested in March after the actress filed a complaint that he, under the pretext of availing twin flats in Versova, Andheri, duped her of gold ornaments and Rs 15 crore. 
 
 She has also alleged that under the pretext of marrying her, he raped her. The police have arrested real estate agent Kishore Nathani for allegedly making fake property documents.
