NAGPUR: This Republic Day, one could expect a show of strength between the Congress-led Opposition and the ruling   on the city streets. The rival rallies, by the opposition to ‘protect democracy’ and by the BJP to ‘forge unity for development,’ could mar the patriotic sentiment that is attached to January 26.

 State   president   is in an aggressive mood with the   recently giving him an extension in the post irrespective of internal polls. He has organized a massive rally on the theme — ‘Save Constitution, Save democracy’— which will be an all-party affair in Mumbai. At the same time every district unit has been directed to hold such a rally at the respective district headquarters.
 
 Responding to the Congress action, the BJP state unit has also chalked out a ‘Tiranga Rally’ where the focus would be on ‘fostering social harmony for development.’ The BJP’s main rally will be in Mumbai and will be executed by the party’s youth wing. It will be addressed by chief minister  .
 
 Following the state president diktat, the Congress city unit will organize a meeting at Samvidhan Square at 3pm. Later, the participants will march up to nearby Gandhi statue at  . The BJP tricolour rally will begin around 9.30am at Gandhi statue at Mahal and march towards Samvidhan Square.
 
 While the Congress sees a clear threat from the BJP to the democracy and Constitution, the ruling party says for last six months there is a deliberate attempt by some political forces to cause social disorder pitting one community against another. “For development which is out main objective, social harmony is absolutely essential. The ‘Tiranga Rally’ is to foster unity in society that the Constitution aspires,” said city BJP president Sudhakar Kohale.
 
 Clearly motives of both the rival parties are suspect. But the common challenge for them is to get people out on the streets on a public holiday.
