PUNE: The   leaders in the Pune Municipal Corporation on Friday assured that action would be taken against the builder for encroaching upon its prime land near  . 

 "The land belongs to the PMC (Pune Municipal Corporation). No person will be allowed to take the land. We have given instructions to the civic administration to take necessary action," mayor  , a BJP corporator, told reporters on Friday.
 
 "We have not put political pressure on the civic administration to delay the action. Steps for dealing with the issue have been initiated. The action will be seen on the ground level within two days," said  , the BJP leader in the PMC.
 
 A builder, who is a close relative of a top BJP leader in the city, allegedly put fence around the vacant plot of the PMC. The civic administration moved the district court on Friday for the removal of the "unauthorized fencing" on the prime land in the Parvati area.
 
 Recently, the office of the deputy commissioner for land and estate had noticed the fencing around the land. A group of elected members from the NCP and the   objected to the fencing, triggering a controversy. The issue was raised in the general body meeting of the PMC.
 
 The property, referred to as plot No. 490 (involving survey No. 32, 33A, 33B, 33C and 34A-2+1 in Parvati), has been the subject matter of a long winding civil dispute dating back to 1979. As of now, the dispute is pending before the district court following an appeal filed by the original owners after their suit was dismissed by a civil judge senior division (CJSD) in 2012.
