BENGALURU: Elephant Head, Taj Mahal, Kensington, Lat Sundari, Agarbathi and more. These aren’t random names strung together but varieties of mangoes being showcased at the   and   2018, which kickstarted on Thursday.

 
 Apart from mangoes of different shapes and sizes—350 varieties are on display — visitors can also look forward to over 100   varieties at the event being hosted by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), Hesaraghatta.
 
 While Elephant Head gets its name from its shape, Kensington is a variety from Australia. Lat Sundari from Odisha is known for its attractive hue. Some mangoes have been named after the place they are grown in.
 
  FROM FOREIGN LANDS
 
 The fair also features foreign varieties like Nam Dok Mai and La Resource from Thailand and Carabao from Philippines. When it comes to size too, there are many variations — while Nyamath, grown in Karnataka, weighs more than 1.3kg per mango, Chandrakaran, a variety from Kerala, weighs just 55 grams.
 
 R Sripriya, 12, a resident of west Bengaluru, was excited to see the elaborate spread. “I had seen and eaten only five to six varieties of the fruit. I now want to taste all of them,” she added. Her family members said they tasted Raspuri and Alphonso, which are among the six varieties on sale. Around 2,500 people visited the fair on Day One.
 
 IIHR director MR Dinesh said the fair aims to showcase the genetic diversity of mangoes and jackfruit. “It’s also a platform to facilitate interactions between scientists, farmers and entrepreneurs,” he added. The three-day mela is open from morning till evening.
