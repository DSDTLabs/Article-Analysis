HYDERABAD: Amravati, the 'blue and green' capital city planned for  , and other tier II cities in AP and Telangana can now join a select group of cities that would benefit from the European Union's (EU) expertise on   as the   of Mayors for Climate and Energy (GCMCE) has decided to expand to India.

 This would help cities in the two states to devise strategies by exchanging ideas with cities in the developed world that have brought down greenhouse gas emission. Amaravati, for instance, is being designed to strike a balance between greenery (green)water (blue) on one hand and carbon emissions on the other. GCMCE has 7,100 mem ber cities from across the world and an effective network for climate action with 23% cut in greenhouse gas emissions.
 
 “Cities in India have not been selected. The project requires cities to participate voluntarily ,“ said EU spokesperson. According to EU release on Tuesday , GCMCE brings together the EU-led Covenants of Mayors, and the UN Compact of Mayors initiatives for the largest and first-of-its-kind coalition of cities to fight climate change.
 
 “The Covenant of Mayors regional office for India will add to the already existing regional Covenant Offices in Europe, Mediterranean and Sub-Saharan Africa,“ it said.India's mega cities, including Hyderabad, are witnes sing the fastest rates of urbanisation in the world.
 
 “With fast growing suburbs and high population density , cities face challenges to enable residential and commercial development, adequate infrastructure and sufficient connectivity . Furthermore, around 17.4% of households in urban India live in slums,“ it said.
 
 Indian cities will be supported to achieve country's climate change commitments, exchangetransfer know-how and capacities with EU cities in the fields of urban sustainable development, energy efficiency and climate action and access the EU market of sustainable innovations by the research and business sectors in the relevant urban fields.
