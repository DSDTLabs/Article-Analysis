Star Plus' Ishqbaaz has been one of the most successful shows of recent times. The show recently completed 200 episodes and it is about to create history with launching its own Spinoff on Indian television. Apart from the spin-off, the show is also going to see a major slot change.
 
  Our sources inform us that   will now air only 5 days a week. The show will air from Monday to Friday at the 10 PM slot.
  
  
 
  
  The reason why such a decision has been taken is to make room for two new shows.   starrer 'Koi Laut Ke Aaya Hai' will now take the weekend 9pm-10pm slot and the show 'Aarambh' will take Ishqbaaaz's slot.
  
  Although Aarambh's on air date is still not revealed, it is definitely going to take Ishqbaaaz's slot. We are yet to get a confirmation from the channel and perhaps we can come to a conclusion after Aarambh's details are revealed.
