NAGPUR: The   project has moved another step forward with the contract for signalling and train control being awarded to a consortium headed by  . Mahametro (earlier NMRCL) has saved Rs 65 crore in the contract as the consortium has bid lower than the estimate.

 Brijesh Dixit, managing director of Mahametro, said that work of signalling and train control of Nagpur Metro Rail was estimated to be 352 crores. “Following international competitive bidding, the tender was awarded to consortium of   &   and SAU Spain for Rs287 crores, “ he said.
 
 “Nagpur Metro will work on communication based train control (CBTC) system using free band of radio frequency for metro signalling which is the latest technology world wide,” Dixit further said.
 
 According to Dixit, there were several advantages of using CBTC system. 
 
 “ It reduces maintenance costs as it minimizes number of personnel and equipment required to maintain system due to minimal track and wayside equipment. The recovery is faster in case of operational disturbances. 
 
 “The life cycle cost is also low. It has control and diagnostic capability as it maximizes train management capability and provides high level of system status and diagnostic information.
 
  “Due to dynamic computing running speeds, speed change can be more smooth and gentle with minimum operational time,” he said.
