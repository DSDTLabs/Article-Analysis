GHAZIABAD: It was raining heavily when  , in charge of   in Muradnagar, heard the loud cries of a woman near Azad Marg locality in the early hours of Friday.

 “I was out patrolling when I heard a woman crying in pain. I followed the voice on my car and saw a woman, in her early twenties, writhing in pain in the middle of the road while a middle-aged man stood helplessly by her,” Zaidi recalled.
 
 Zaidi approached the man, who was in tears. The man pleaded to the cop to take his pregnant daughter-in-law to the hospital as she was in labour.
 
 Zaidi rushed the woman, Arshi, and her father-in-law to the nearby government hospital, which was about 5km away. 
 
 “I dropped them both at the hospital, instructed the hospital staff to take care of the woman, and then I left,” he said.
 
 An hour later Arshi gave birth to a baby boy in a normal delivery. Later, while speaking to TOI, Arshi’s father-in-law Reyaz, thanked Zaidi for his kind gesture.
 
 “My daughter in-law went into labour around 1am and our numerous attempts to call an ambulance failed. Hoping to find some help, we came out till the main road and waited for at least half an hour but her condition worsened. I was clueless and worried, but much to our relief, I saw Zaidi in his car and asked him for help,” Reyaz, a tailor by profession and a resident of Azad Marg, said.
 
 Overwhelmed with gratitude, the family now wants the good Samaritan cop to name the newborn. “It was all because of him that my daughter-in-law delivered a healthy baby boy and we want him to name the child,” Reyaz said.
