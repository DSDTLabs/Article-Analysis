AHMEDABAD: The academic council of   will hold a meeting on Thursday, primarily to discuss ‘carry-forward’ system of examination for students. The varsity officials are mulling over abolishing the entire system.

 Sources said that the syndicate body members are likely to push for a proposal that will abolish the ‘carry-forward’ system. In case a student has not cleared all the subjects from semester 1 to semester 3, one will not be eligible to appear for exams in semester 5. “Several students have backlog in 20-22 subjects by the time they enter the semester 5. However, they don’t get a degree due to such backlog and this will affect the overall results of the students as well,” said a source.
 
 The syndicate members are also of the opinion that the university exam for semester 1 to semester 3 be conducted through   (Optical Mark Reading) system. This is because owing to a late admission process, the time for semester 1 is quite short to complete the entire syllabus. Moreover, due to exams spanning over a couple of months, there is again less time for teaching-learning process. “Introducing OMR will ensure speedy assessment of the papers and therefore, help deliver results within 15 days, thus saving on time,” said a well-placed source. Syndicate body members have also pushed for respective institutes conducting semester-end exams instead of the varsity. However, the institutes protested the move claiming that if the university is   from the students, why they should conduct examination. The issue will also be discussed in the meeting on Thursday.
