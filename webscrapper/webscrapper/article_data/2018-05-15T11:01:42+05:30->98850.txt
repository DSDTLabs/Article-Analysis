Singer   said she resorted to self-harm when she shot to fame after releasing her hit single   in 2010. 

 The 17-year-old, who is the daughter of actors   and  , was barely 10 when she became a singing sensation. 
 
 She said she suddenly suffered from existential crisis after receiving early success which led her to start cutting her wrists. 
 
  
  
 "It was after that whole 'Whip My Hair' thing and I had just stopped doing singing lessons and I was kind of just in this grey area of, 'Who am I? Do I have a purpose? Is there anything I can do besides this?' 
 
 "After the tour and the promotion and all of that, they wanted me to finish my album. And I was like, I'm not gonna do that. And after all of that kinda settled down and it was like a kind of lull, I was just listening to a lot of dark  . It was just so crazy and I was plunged into this black hole, and I was cutting myself," Willow told Jada.
 
  actor was shocked by the confession. 
 
 "What? When were you cutting yourself? I didn't see that part. Cutting yourself where?" 
 
 To which Willow responded, "On my wrist. I mean, you can't even see it but there's still a little something there. But like, totally lost my sanity for a moment there. I never talk about it because it was such a short weird point in my life. But you have to pull yourself out of it." 
 
 Jada also shares son  , 19, with Will Smith.
