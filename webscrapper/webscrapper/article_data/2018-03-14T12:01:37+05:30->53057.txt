MARGAO: Margao wore a deserted look by noon, on Tuesday, as city-based traders downed the shutters of their establishments to keep their tryst with their patron deity   at Zambaulim, 25km from the state’s commercial capital. It’s their ardent belief that  , as Lord Damodar is reverentially referred to, plays gulal with the Madgaonkars on this auspicious day.

 Hours later as the famous ‘Zambaulecho Gulal’ got underway, it was a riot of colours amidst a sea of devotees. Cries of ‘Shree Ramnath Damodar Maharaj ki jai!’ and ‘Har Har Mahadev’ rent the air as revellers danced with gusto flinging fistfuls of gulal at the palanquin carrying the idol of Lord Damodar stationed in the courtyard of  . Within seconds a cloud of red enveloped the landscape.
 
 History has it that the original temple of Lord Damodar was located in the area known as ‘Madd’ in Margao. During the early conquests by the Portuguese in the 16th century, locals attempted to shift the Shivling to a safer place, but only managed to sever a part of it, which they shifted to Zambaulim. 
 
 It is in honour of Shree Ramnath and with a sense of gratitude to him for offering his place for Lord Damodar that Dambab’s palanquin is brought to the temple of Shree Ramnath on the night preceding the ‘gulal’. 
 
 The week-long Shishirotsav began with the arrival of the holy coconut from the house of late   in Comba, Margao to the Damodar temple on Thursday. ‘Dhulpeth’ is celebrated the day after ‘gulal’, which is famous for the sumptuous meals served to the devotees that day. The shigmotsav culminates with the immersion of the coconut.
