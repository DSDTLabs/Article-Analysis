THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   has commissioned two major facilities including a   and a shock tunnel at   (VSSC) here on Monday. This is the World's third largest hypersonic wind tunnel, next only to the ones in the US and Russia. These facilities will help in the launch of aerospace vehicles at hypersonic speed (which is five times the speed of sound or Mach 5) and to reduce the cost of access to space with future reusable launch vehicles (RLV). 

 Commissioning the facilities, Isro chairman   said that such facilities would provide adequate data for design and development of current and future space transportation systems in the country. Dedicating the facilities in memory of Satish Dhawan, a pioneer in the field, he named the facility as Satish Dhawan wind tunnel complex.
 
 "While ISRO is planning future missions such as RLV, air breathing propulsion system and human space flight programme, Aerothermodynamic characterization of these vehicles in hypersonic flow regime is very vital for optimum design and successful mission," he said. These facilities have been indigenously designed, developed and made in India with the support of Indian industries, he added.
 
 VSSC director   said the new facilities would help aerodynamic characterization of advanced space transportation systems.
 
 Renowned aerodynamicist Roddam Narasimha and VSSC associate director S Pandian were also present on the occasion.
