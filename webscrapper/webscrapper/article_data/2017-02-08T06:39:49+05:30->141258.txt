CHENNAI: A seven-year-old girl went missing from her house at   on Sunday evening. 

 Hasini Chandru was last seen playing alone near her apartment complex at 6.15 pm.
 
 Hasini is a class III student of a private school nearby. On Sunday, her parents went shopping leaving her alone at home. The child was playing with a few children in the apartment. After a while the other children went to their homes and she was left alone. Hasini was seen asking children in her neighbouring house to play with her.
 
 Hasini's parents who returned home after an hour could not find her in any of the neighbouring houses. They lodged a complaint with the   police.   footage from the street corner showed her playing alone on the street for at least an hour.
 
 Police ruled out kidnapping, as the parents did not receive any ransom call. They are questioning a few suspects. Police also checked the storm water drains and a pit dug up for a borewell.
 
 A few workers who were constructing a building opposite the apartment complex were also questioned.
 
 "Her photograph has been been sent to all police stations in the locality," said a police officer.
