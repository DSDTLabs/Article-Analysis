THRISSUR: As water shortage is getting severe in major parts of the city, the opposition councillors staged a   in front of the corporation office on Saturday.

 “Though the government had declared the state as drought-hit, the corporation here fails to initiate measures to ensure water supply. Usually by this time tender procedures should have been over and water supply started,” said  , opposition leader in the corporation. 
 
 He alleged that the corporation did not foresee the intensity of the drought because of which it could not arrange any solutions for the water scarcity here.
 
 DCC president T N Prathapan inaugurated the protest in which MLA Anil Akkara also took part.
 
 While Koorkkenchery, Edakkunny and Ollukkara regions face serious water shortage, the corporation is using just four of the its six trucks to supply drinking water. The protesters also alleged drawbacks in using funds of the decentralized planning projects.
 
 Meanwhile, the corporation opened tenders called for buying six more trucks in a time-bound manner.
 
 “Buying new trucks for the corporation will eliminate chances of corruption in allotting drinking water supply tenders in the future,” said health standing committee chairperson M L Rossy.
 
 As many as Rs 65 lakh has been allocated for buying two trucks with a capacity of 8,000 litres and four with a capacity of 4,000 litres
 
 “The two trucks have been undergoing repair works, and once it gets over, it will be used for supplying water in the city. Until then, only four trucks will be available,” she added.
 
 Though the water authority had laid pipes in most parts of the city, pipe breaks often and lack of water in Peechi dam has affected the water supply leading to severe drinking water shortage in the city.
