KOLKATA: It was all of fun and games for revellers on Sunday morning as the   leg of ‘Happy Streets’, a TOI initiative in association with Bidhannagar City Police, came to a conclusion. The previous two Sundays — Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve — had been similarly merry. The event will now continue for a few more Sundays at a different place.

 Thousands descended on the T-junction in front of   with Poura Bhavan at one end, GD Island at another end and the   school near Karunamoyee at the end of the third arm. 
 
 Revellers who have been regularly attending  , as well as those who came for the first time on Sunday, said they were looking forward to the continuance of the initiative. 
 
 “My daughter has been coming here regularly, but I have come for the first time. It has been quite enjoyable,” said Manoj Kumar Mantri, who came with his family from Kankurgachi.
 
 Attendees had a fun time with friends and family, passing the time in the football, cricket, basketball and badminton zones. There was also yoga by Healthy Billions, a recreational and healing activity by the Healing Drum Circle and a tug of war zone by TAFI. 
 
 Kids were engrossed in the activity groups with The Little Gym and Sticky Bits, as well as at the skating arena for children organized by Fun on Wheels. A karate zone, set up for martial arts enthusiasts by JKF Goju Kai Takuji Kenbukan Karate Do India, also drew in a crowd.
 
 On the main stage, the crowd got hooked to a performance by the musical band Tritaal, followed by a zumba session by Vivala Salsa that made people dance their sleepiness away. 
 
 “This was my first visit to Happy Streets and it has been an amazing experience. We are looking forward for more Happy Streets,” said Mangala Gupta, a college student who came with her friends from Sovabazar. 
 
 “It is such a lovely initiative and a nice experience. I want this initiative to continue,” said Jitendra Sharma, a first timer to Happy Streets who came from Bangur.
