  The study claims that nearly 58% of the accidents were related to driving behaviour, 33% were related to vehicle speed and 25% accidents occurred due to lack of attention, presence of mind or late reflexes.
 
  
  Of the total accidents, nearly 15% involved at least one pedestrian. The study says, “Of the total 34 pedestrian accident victims studied in this study, 19 pedestrians (49%) behaved dangerously on the road which solely or in combination contributed in the occurrence of accidents.” Improper lane change and improper lane usage by a driver topped the list of the most common reason behind accident occurrence on Ahmedabad roads. “Improper lane change is due to a driver or two wheeler rider either weaving diagonally across lanes--rather than moving through one after another in an orderly progression--or failing to check mirrors or indicate intention to other drivers before changing lanes, catching other drivers by surprise.,” the study claims
 
  
  The study further pointed out that many motorcyclist and motorists were “observed changing lanes without giving proper indication or trying to squeeze themselves between the tiny gaps present in traffic.”
 
 Improper lane usage includes travelling on shoulder of roadways, travelling on wrong lanes for conditions , which is taking a right turn from the center or left lane and travelling partially on more than one lanes. “Turning suddenly is a similar scenario, the driver performs a precipitous manoeuvre,” says the study.
