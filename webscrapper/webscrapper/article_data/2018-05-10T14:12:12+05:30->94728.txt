TIRUNELVELI: A white male horse endured agonizing moments as doctors pulled a roundworm from its eye in a 40-minute operation at the   (VC&RI) Institute here on Tuesday. After the half-inch   was removed, the horse was discharged from the hospital and would now require at least 10 days of rest. 

 The seven-and-a-half-year-old horse is one of the two Kathiawari breed owned by Nallasivam, 45, of Alwarkurichi. They are used mainly for pulling chariots in temple festivals and weddings.   took the horse to the vet after he noticed lacrimation (profuse tears) in the left eye of the horse.
 
 He had found a wriggling worm in the cornea which had turned white. The doctor, however, referred the horse to the VC&RI where the surgery was performed. Though the animal was taken to the hospital on Friday, the doctors refused to do the surgery as its stomach was full.
 
 “We had to keep the horse on empty stomach for 24 hours for the surgery. On Tuesday morning we administered anaesthesia and performed the surgery. We drilled a small hole in the cornea and retrieved the worm,” S  , head of the department of veterinary surgery said.
 
 The doctors advised Nallasivam to give the horse10 days’ rest and keep it under medication. The horse would also be taken to VC&RI for review. Spread by mosquitoes, the roundworm belongs to Setaria species and is usually found in cattle.
 
 The veterinarian said these worms were rarely found in horses. “This is the first time a horse has undergone surgery for this condition in the Tirunelveli VCR&RI. If left untreated, the cornea would have been damaged and vision would have been affected permanently,” Dharmaceelan said.
 
 He said the surgery was the only remedy in this condition. With deworming, we can kill the worm but it will remain in the cornea as an antibody and damage the vision permanently. The surgery was performed by a team of veterinarians led by Dharmaceelan, comprising T Vishnu Gurubharan, R Ninu, S Kokila and M Bharathidasan.
