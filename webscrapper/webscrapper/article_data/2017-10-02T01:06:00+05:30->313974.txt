Coimbatore: While the long weekend and puja holidays offered an ideal time for leisure trips and relaxation for many, a group of denizens here came together to clean and de-silt two city lakes - Ganganarayansamudram and Muthanan Kulam.

 Thanking their efforts, R Manikandan of NGO Kovai Kulangal Pathukaapu Amaippu, said that though Coimbatore recorded excess rainfall this year, the lakes had not filled up. “The amount of water stored is also very less. When we discussed it with the public works department officials, we realised that they did not get enough funds for maintaining the lakes,” he told TOI.
 
 The NGO discussed the issue with a group of socially responsible denizens. “We decided that we cannot keep waiting for the government to take steps and we should also take the initiative and do something. So, we decided to clean and rejuvenating the lakes. We have been doing it for the last 34 weeks. This weekend, since there were many holidays, we requested the volunteers to spare an extra day and some extra time. All of them were more than willing to do that,” he said.
 
 On Sunday, the volunteers planted nearly 1,000 palm seeds on the tank bunds of Sottaiyandi Kuttai. “All of us got together not just to revive our lakes, but also to create awareness about the importance of waterbodies. Many people do not even know the names of these lakes. When they come for such works, they learn a lot about the local water course,” said Manikandan.
