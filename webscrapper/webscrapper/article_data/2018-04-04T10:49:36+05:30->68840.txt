Bhubaneswar: ATK’s despicable season got over with a whimper as   beat them 3-1 to move into the quarterfinals of the   here on Tuesday evening.

 
 Having finished second from bottom in ISL-4,   & Co had a chance to salvage their
 
 season in this knockout tournament. But Goa were in no mood to allow their rivals any comfort, handing   a lesson in passing  .
 
 The imperious Ferran Corominas — who won the Golden Boot in ISL-4 scoring 18 goals — was once again a key architect of Goa’s win. The Spaniard continued his goal-scoring spree by putting his team ahead on the cusp of half time.
 
 Robbie Keane revived ATK’s hopes with the equalizer in the 50th minute. However, the twotime   champions collapsed soon after as Hugo Moumous (70th minute) and Brandon Fernandes (78th) found the target to seal Goa’s deserving victory.
