NEW DELHI: Old allies India and Russia will have the opportunity to deliberate on differences that have appeared in strategic ties over Moscowâ€™s recent overtures to   and the outreach to   at a high level when Prime Minister   meets Russian Deputy PM   next week on the sidelines of Vibrant Gujarat Summit.
 
  Modi had invited his Russian counterpart   to attend this edition of Vibrant Gujarat between January 9 and 14 but the Russian government deputed Rogozin, the point person for   ties, for the Summit. Rogozin is leading a 70-member delegation at the meet where Russia will showcase its industrial strengths with potential of investments in India, people familiar with the developments said.
  
  Plans are also afoot for Modi to inaugurate the mega Russian pavilion at Vibrant Gujarat. This will be the biggest ever Russian presence at this summit so far.
  
  Russian nuclear major Rosatom, which has supplied reactors for the Kudankulam plant, will be present on the occasion as two countries hope to sign contracts for fifth and sixth units of the TN--based nuclear power station later this month. The line of credit to finance the two units have been firmed up and contracts are ready to be concluded, officials hinted.
  
  All eyes though will be on the meeting between Modi and Rogozin, which will be held in the backdrop of recent overtures made by Moscow to Pakistan and holding of a trilateral dialogue with Islamabad and Beijing on Afghanistan that plans outreach to Taliban with the goal of fighting the Islamic State.
  
  While the Modi-Rogozin interaction will formally focus on India-Russia economic partnership, energy and defence projects, it could also be an opportunity to touch on the political and strategic issues. While India did not formally lodge protest with Russia, Delhi is closely observing the developments in the region where it has huge stakes, sources said.
