Surat: City police commissioner Satish Sharma has withdrawn his circular banning entry of media persons with cameramen in the police station and government offices. It was withdrawn after the local association of journalists dashed off a letter to chief minister Vijay Rupani and junior home minister Pradeepsinh Jadeja opposing the directive. In the circular issued on Tuesday, Sharma cited the incident of video shooting during arrest of diamond baron Vasant Gajera in Umra police station. It is stated that when the video was played on a news channel, it harmed the purpose of identification parade of the accused. Citing this reason, Sharma banned entry of media persons and videographer into government offices, too, through the circular. He also instructed the police to keep required number of policemen at the spot of crime and photography or videography should be allowed only if it is not harming the probe. The journalists’ body wrote in a letter to the CM that Gajera’s picture in which he was holding the slate went viral after a photographer called by police shared the photos on social media. Police had registered an offence against the photographer later. On Wednesday, the earlier circular was cancelled. Further, it was ordered that unauthorized photography or videography of arrested accused and those kept in lockups should not be allowed. Police were also instructed to make arrangement for photography and videography at the spot of crime in a way that it does not harm the evidences at the spot. “Police face problems in identification parade and other legal procedures if face of an accused is revealed in the media. Our objective is not to restrict media, but to ensure that the case doesn’t get affected. I have issued fresh circular following the objections raised,” Sharma said.
