SHILLONG: A murder case has been registered against constable Lusen A Sangma who shot dead havildar Litsingh Inghi in Meghalaya's   district last Sunday. 

 "We have registered a murder case against the constable. As a corrective measure, the district police chiefs and battalion commandants in the state have been directed to sensitize and educate the force on maintaining discipline among the personnel," DGP SB Singh said on Mondauy. 
 
 Sangma shot dead Inghi in the early hours of Sunday at the Third Battalion camp at  , around 15 km from Jowai, the district headquarters. Sangma, who was reportedly drunk, rushed to the room of Inghi and fired six rounds from his weapon, killing the latter on the spot.
 
 The DGP pointed out that the police force was a 'manpower intensive force' and hence the issue of 'man-management' is very critical. He said the aberrations could be because of many factors, including personal problems, stress level and also alcohol.
 
 "Alcohol only enhances and accentuates enmity," said Singh.
