PANAJI: Continuing its expansion strategy, the Narayan Bandekar-led   commenced   operations at its first international manufacturing facility. Set up in Zambia, at an investment of $12 million, the manufacturing facility will formulate medications for treatment of TB and   for the sub-Saharan African market.

 The manufacturing facility, operated by the subsidiary company NRB Pharmaceuticals Zambia limited, was commissioned on April 26 by the President of the Republic of Zambia, Edgar Changwa Lungu, at Lusaka.
 
 “The plant has an installed capacity to manufacture 375 million tablets and capsules annually. We have applied for   certification and it is expected soon. We will be the first World Health Organisation (WHO) certified pharmaceutical plant in Zambia. Initially, we will cater to Zambia, but later we will expand and cater to huge demands in sub-Saharan Africa,” Bandekar said.
 
 NRB Pharma will produce anti-magnetic, antibiotics and anti-tuberculosis tablets. Once the WHO approval is granted, the firm will manufacture anti-retroviral drugs for HIV / AIDS.
 
 According the   report for 2016, an estimated 25.5 million people infected with HIV live in sub-Saharan Africa. The vast majority of them, an estimated 19 million, live in east and southern Africa which saw 46% of new HIV infections globally in 2015.
 
 According to the UNAIDS Gap Report 2016, Zambia itself has 12.9% of its adult population living with HIV and the country reported 20,000 deaths due to AIDS in 2016.
 
 Zambia has set up an exclusive economic zone and is making strong efforts to attract investment in Zambia.
