AHMEDABAD: In an important order, a city sessions court has directed jail authorities to help all prisoners who desire to obtain   card.

 The court on Friday directed jail authorities to undertake communication with all concerned departments and hold a camp in the   for those prisoners who wish to obtain Aadhaar card.
 
 The court was of the view that if there is a necessity of presenting the prisoner before officials of concerned departments, he/she can be taken out of jail under police protection to the concerned department in order to complete the process of applying for Aadhaar.
 
 The court’s directions came while dealing with a bail plea filed by a murder accused to attend wedding of his cousin as well as to undertake the procedure to obtain Aadhaar. Mahendra Sisodia alias Lal Badshah had sought temporary bail to attend the social function and to apply for Aadhaar, which is a much required document nowadays.
 
 Additional sessions judge, S L Thakkar granted a day’s bail to Lal Badshah under police protection to attend his cousin’s marriage in a village near   on February 6. But in response to his request for release for Aadhaar, the court issued directions in the interest of all prisoners.
 
 Amid controversy over the Centre’s diktats for Aadhaar linkages, Chhattisgarh high court recently had made it compulsory for all prisoners to present Aadhaar to obtain bail. The issue reached the   with the lawyers’ association in the state opposing the direction claiming that it was a curb on a prisoner’s right to liberty. The apex court has asked the Chhattisgarh HC to take up hearing on the subject again.
 
 Meanwhile, the   reportedly is mulling a recommendation to replace surety bonds with Aadhaar or voter ID cards for bail in case of minor offences.
