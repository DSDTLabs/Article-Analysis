KOLKATA:   finally started leaving the confines of Kolkata Dock System ( ) and   (HDC) of Kolkata   Trust (KoPT) on Monday, albeit at a very slow pace. The directorate of revenue intelligence (DRI) and the department of customs had stopped movement of containers from these port facilities over the weekend after an alert on the movement of fake notes and sophisticated arms from foreign shores.

 “Containers unloaded on Monday weren’t allowed to leave but we are now moving out those cleared on Saturday. There is no congestion as yet. We can sustain for two more days at this pace,” said S Balaji Arun Kumar, deputy chairman, KoPT.
 
 While importers have adopted a wait-and-watch policy, port officials believe that if this continues for too long, productivity will fall and year-end results will suffer. Senior officials from security agencies, however, said that it is high time better checking measures are adopted at the major ports like KoPT.
 
 “We are allowing the movement of containers after proper checks,” said Dr N K Soren, commissioner of customs (port).
