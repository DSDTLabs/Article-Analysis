CHHAPRA: Doctors attached with various government hospitals, primary health centres (PHCs) and sadar hospitals went on an indefinite   on Wednesday morning paralysing healthcare services in   district.

 The strike was called to protest the alleged assault on doctors and staff of Chhapra sadar hospital by the kin and attendants of a deceased patient. One Md   (18), who got an electrical shock injury, was brought for treatment on Tuesday night. However, the doctor on duty after examining the patient declared him brought dead.
 
 As soon as the doctor pronounced Shahabuddin dead, relatives and other attendants of the patients not only misbehaved with the doctor and staff but also vandalised the hospital. Window panes, furniture and costly equipment were damaged in the incident, said hospital sources.
 
 A sadar hospital doctor claiming emotional distress and fear of assault said, “We are not feeling safe and the miscreants should be arrested before we get back to work.” Sadar SDO   along with   Ajai   met the striking doctors and tried to resolve the crisis but they insisted on their demands to arrest the miscreants and provide permanent security to the hospital staff. 
 
  said, “We have assured the doctors that the culprits will be soon arrested and have even requested them to call off their strike in the interest of the humanity.”
