PANAJI: After the advent of  , no longer would budding cricketers dream only about batting or bowling.

 
 
 At Goa Fest 2018 in Bambolim, on the outskirts of the city, on Friday, the South African legend enthralled an audience when, his prowess as perhaps the greatest fielder of all time, dominated his lively recounter.
 
 His iconic runout of Pakistan’s portly   at no bigger stage than the 1992 World Cup in Australia flashed back in a trice.
 
 The chirpy 48-year-old, however, dismissed it as a “stumble over a bootlace and onto the stumps!”
 
 Rhodes was, until December 2017, fielding coach of IPL team   and had the audience in splits again when he recollected his travails at watching Munaf Patel, not the most athletic, taking a high catch or attempting to save a boundary.
 
 There were moments of seriousness too as Rhodes dwelled on the match-fixing scandal unearthed in 2000, with his former captain and friend Hansie Cronje at the centre, that shook the world.
 
 “Hansie was deeply interested in the stock market. He loved money. That’s perhaps why he got lured into the match-fixing thing,” Rhodes revealed. 
 
 Inevitably, Rhodes was drawn into commenting on the recent Sandpaper Gate ball-tampering scandal.
 
 “We South Africans are no angels here,” he said while citing incidents involving current Test captain   and fast bowler  . But, relevant to the theme of the evening, the Leadership Summit, Rhodes made a point about Steven Smith, the Aussie captain at the centre of the storm. “The ‘brainfade’ incident on the tour of India last year followed by Cameron Bancroft’s scuffing of the ball with sandpaper reflect on an erosion of leadership on the part of Steve,” Rhodes said.
