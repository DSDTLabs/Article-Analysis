NEW DELHI: Justice is still a dream for this 22-year-old Santhali woman from a village in   district of  . Almost five years ago, she was in news as “the battered maid of Vasant Kunj”, allegedly assaulted brutally by her employer, a senior staffer at an MNC. Since then, the woman, who was trafficked to the capital, had gone home and now helps her mother with farm work.

 In 2013, she was rescued from a flat in   with deep injuries on her body and maggot-infested wounds on her head. Her case saw drafting of a law to crack down on traffickers working in the garb of placement agencies. After the rescue, the then Jharkhand government had made her the ambassador for the state’s anti-trafficking campaign. But a lot still remains to be done. Both the accused and the traffickers are out on bail. The case will be heard again on January 29.
 
 Since returning to Jharkhand, the woman had turned into a spirited fighter at a government-run home for trafficking survivors. She used to play football and even won a marathon in Sahebganj. When that home was shut down in 2016, she was sent to a shelter in the district where she learned to stitch clothes. She also dreamed of running a full-fledged tailoring centre. However, her desire to earn a livelihood still remains a dream.
 
 Ravikant, the president of   that helped the DCW team rescue her in 2013, said the case reflected the gaps in the implementation of the law. “Nowhere does the compensation scheme stipulate that the survivor will be compensated at the end of the case. However, despite her rescue in a horrible state from her employer’s home, this woman is yet to be compensated,” he pointed out.
