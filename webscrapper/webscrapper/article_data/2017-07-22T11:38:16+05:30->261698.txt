The revelations were made by additional director general of police (ADGP)  , who is also the chief of STF. Sidhu was in Amritsar to visit the Swami Vivekananad drug de-addiction centre. The senior cop further claimed that his team was receiving inputs from public and other sources which lead to recovery of drug consignments and crucial information about local drug dealers.

 Five members of Jaggu Bhagwanpuria’s gang were recently arrested with 500g of heroin in Amritsar. During interrogation, they told cops that Jaggu was passing on instructions to them using a cellphone inside the jail.
