BENGALURU: Mounting a stinging attack on the Siddaramaiah government over its decision to accord religious minority status to   and alleged divisive politics of  , PM   on Thursday said parties have been giving “lollipops” to castes and communities in a bid to win elections.

 “The political parties of the past are used to dividing communities, castes and creeds in every election. Unko lollipop diya jata hai (They are given lollipops). If you analyse the elections of the past five to 10 years, these parties have been giving false assurances to one caste or the other for electoral gains. And once they come to power, they forget the caste or community and move on to another caste or commuity for the next election and give them another lollipop,” Modi said, likening the sweet taste of “lollipops” to appeasement and divisive politics.
 
 The PM, who was scheduled to leave for China for bilateral talks on Thursday, held a 45-minute video conference through his app with   workers and leaders to give them a pep talk in the run-up to the May 12 elections.
 
 “And because of these lollipops, unfortunately, people from the community are fashioned into voting for that political party,” said Modi. The PM said the main intent behind these political parties appeasing communities was to sidestep and avoid discussion on stagnation in development, as it is quantifiable and measurable.
 
 Modi urged party workers to “help him” in getting rid of Congress from the state to ensure a transition in Karnataka’s development.
 
 “The Congress way of obstructive politics has been a stumbling block for the development of Karnataka. It is the Congress policies which have stagnated the development of the state and the country. I have an agenda to take   on the path of development and for this I need your help,” he said.
