  “The water flow has come down drastically in the last few days from 2,592cusecs on Tuesday to 1,064cusecs on Thursday,” said an assistant executive engineer of the department.
 
 He added that the water level would touch the 100ft mark in case of good rainfall in the catchment area of Krishnagiri dam.
 
 However, the water level has improved much better than the last year optimum level. In the month of October 2016, the water level stood at 92 feet and it did not go beyond that.
 
  The water would be released from Sathanur reservoir once the water level touches 117ft. “We will issue flood warning only when the water level touches 114ft,” he said.
 
 The officials have been maintaining the water level at 54.07ft as against the capacity of 59ft in the   reservoir for the past few days. 
 
 The officials said that the water level touched the optimum storage level in 28 tanks out of 610 in the district.
