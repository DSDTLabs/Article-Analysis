'Boys don’t cry’, ‘Boys are strong’, ‘Don’t be such a girl’ — young   (played by  ) has grown up listening to this from his father Shamsher Singh (portrayed by  ). Brought up in a typical patriarchal milieu, this ‘little man’ has often wondered why he is being chastised for his behaviour by the men in his family. Weaving a beautiful story around social acceptance is the channel’s new show, 'Roop –  ', which starts tonight at 9 pm on Colors. It’s set to challenge stereotypes and redefine the new age mard, who doesn’t consider being sensitive a sign of femininity.

 Commenting on the show, Manisha Sharma, Programming Head – Colors, said, “The most beautiful part about Roop’s character is that he has three sisters. By default, he loves helping his mom and playing with his sisters, which in the real world isn’t considered appropriate for boys. As an 8-year-old boy, Roop is very confused as to why the universe is pushing girls to become inspectors, but looks down upon boys who want to study home science or enjoy stitching and cooking. He’s very perplexed because his father is a police officer, who thinks men should be very macho and play with guns to show off their manhood. Like our other shows on social issues, this one is going to touch upon the fact that why in the new world, must a man establish his manhood through things which are aggressive and violent.” The show attempts to leave behind the idea of ‘beti ko beta banao’ and embrace the idea ‘bete ko beti jaise banao’. Well-established actors like Mitaali Nag, Vaishali Thakkar, Nikki Sharma, Ananya Agarwal and Tasheen Shah will be seen in pivotal roles.
