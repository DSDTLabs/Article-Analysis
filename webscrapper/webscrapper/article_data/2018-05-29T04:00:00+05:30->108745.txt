Mumbai: Led by oil stocks rising on the back of crude prices sliding globally, the   rallied over 300 points intra-day on Monday and closed with a gain of 241 points at 35,165. Brent crude prices are down about 7% in two days from the recent high of over $80 per barrel, after   and Russia said supply will be boosted. This led to a slump in the prices of oil globally, which in turn helped improve sentiment on  , brokers and dealers said. 

 Earlier, as crude prices shot through to multi-year-high levels, there were apprehensions about economic growth stagnating, especially in oil-importing countries like India. On Monday, stocks of oil marketing companies (OMCs) rallied with HPCL leading with a 6.1% gain.
 
 Till recently, after petrol and diesel also became expensive in India on the back of rising crude prices, there were fears among market players that at some point probably OMCs will be asked to share — along with consumers — part of the burden of paying more for crude imports. Such fears had led to a substantial drop in stock prices of OMCs. With the crude prices dropping, the situation is now reversing, market players said.
 
 According to   president Jayant Manglik, the market traded in an upbeat mode and gained nearly a percent as it took respite from further decline in crude prices. “Most sectoral indices, barring IT, traded in tandem to benchmark index and posted decent gains and the same bias was witnessed on the broader front. Besides, firm global markets added to the positivity and helped maintain the upward momentum,” Manglik said.
 
 The day’s gains came on the back of a Rs 1,018-crore net inflow by domestic funds while foreign funds were net sellers at Rs 795 crore, BSE data showed. Investors’ wealth saw an addition of Rs 1.6 lakh crore, taking BSE’s market capitalisation to almost Rs 150 lakh crore.
