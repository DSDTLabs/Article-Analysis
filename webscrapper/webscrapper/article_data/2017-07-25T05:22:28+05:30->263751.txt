KOLKATA: A   was aware of malpractices that were taking place in the name of providing houses under the   (PMAY). “I had warned the party leadership to take preventive action but not much was done on the ground,” Samik Bhattacharya, the   revealed on Monday when he went to Bhawani Bhawan to join the ongoing probe in the PMAY case.

 The more than three-hour questioning of the former MLA was mainly focussed on identifying the people under whom the accused   leaders went about distributing the forms and then actually cheating the villagers. 
 
 “I have known accused Ranjit Pal. But then, I was the MLA till May last year. Some documents and photographs shown to me by the CID pertain to the months of November and December in 2015. Hence, I had little time to comprehend the entire crime. However, no leader of BJP ever asked him to involve in any crime and the party has no role in this. If, however, any leader indeed supported him, it must be on an individual capacity,” said Bhattacharya.
