GHAZIABAD: The Allahabad high court on Friday directed the state government to submit a report within one week on steps taken so far to implement the provisions of Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016.

 The order came on a   filed by FedAOA, an apex body of Apartment Owners Associations in  , which alleged that the government has not yet formed a   or the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal as mandated by the Act, thereby defeating the very purposefor which   was enacted. “A division bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justice   has asked the standing counsel for the state to get instructions from the government and inform the court about the steps taken by the state government in establishing the Rera Authority. The court will hear the matter afresh on May 19,” said Shehnaz Ahmed, counsel for FedAOA. 
 
 Alok Kumar, patron of FedAOA, said: “As per sections 20(1) and 43(4) of Rera, the state government is required to form the authority within one year from the date of notification of the Act. In this case, Rera was notified on May 1, 2016 and by May 1, 2017, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority and the Real Estate Appellate Tribunal should have been formed. But that has not happened so far, forcing us to file a PIL. This has rendered the whole Act useless.” The PIL also claimed the state government was mandated to set   a websitegiving details of all real estate projects and even that has not happened.
