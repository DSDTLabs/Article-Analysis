SHIMLA: Tourist town of Shimla is facing acute shortage of drinking   with supply being made to the residents after a gap of three-four days. When the BJP had come to power in the Shimla municipal corporation on the promise of providing 24 hours water supply, now it is not even been able to maintain the supply once in 24 hours. While the residents of the hill town are left high and dry, authorities are blaming deficient rainfall in winters, power failures and technical snags for the existing problem.

 Several residents have alleged that water was being supplied after 3-4 days and that too for a very limited period due to which they are not able to store water. 
 
 Not only local residents, but even the tourists are facing problems due to water shortage. Tourism Industry Stakeholders Association president Mohinder Seth said failing to improve water supply in popular tourist town of Shimla was having adverse impact on the tourism industry. .
 
 Summer Hill Ward councillor Shelli Sharma said in its election manifesto the BJP had claimed to provide 24-hour water supply to the Shimla residents, but now situation was that supply was being done after 3-4 days and that too in a low quantity that would not meet the demand for even a day. 
 
 While mayor Kusum Sadrate did not answer calls made on her mobile phone, deputy mayor   said not only Shimla but the entire   was facing water shortage this time due to almost negligible rainfall during winter season. “April rainfall has improved the situation to a little extent,” he added.
 
 The deputy mayor said power cut and leakage in main lines were resulting into less lifting of water.
