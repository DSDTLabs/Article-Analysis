Coimbatore: A group of eight   from Irugur, under the aegis of the Tamil Nadu Farmers’ Association, on Monday took out a march to the district collectorate carrying a large plough and petitioned the collector, T N Hariharan, against the government’s policy of outsourcing crop insurances to private players and urged the state government to take up and run all crop insurances.

 “The private firm selected by the government just wants to make profit and as such it doesn’t want to pay us full compensation,” said S Palanisamy, president of the farmers’ association. “Farmers pay the   premium while taking a loan. But when the crop fails, the insurance payout does not come through. Farmers, who often rely on this payout to take care of loan interests, end up defaulting their loan and get into deep debt,” he added.
 
 The farmers pointed out that the crop loan premium was often automatically deducted from the loan amount. “But when the crops damage due to wind or animal raid, the insurer backs off with a loophole, saying it can compensate only if crops in the entire district was damaged. When weather experts predict low rain fall or prolonged drought condition, the insurance companies start returning premiums or refuse to accept premiums because of the risk involved,” Palanisamy said.
 
 Farmers, meanwhile, said they were finding it difficult to negotiate with a private player and urged the state government to handle the entire process its own. “The point of an insurance is to create a savings mechanism that would help us in times of dire need. And with private companies, it is not working out this way. Like chief minister’s comprehensive health insurance scheme, the government should make insurance payouts directly through the banks from where we have taken loans,” they said.
