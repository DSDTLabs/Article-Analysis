RAJKOT: The forest department arrested two persons in connection with the poaching of chinkara (Indian Gazelle) from   village of Amreli district on Monday. The accused   (25) and   (33), both from Mityala village, had allegedly killed the chinkara on the night of May 5 when over 100 forest officers were on their prowl.

 Forest officials said that the accused duo will be produced in the court on Tuesday. One accused was arrested earlier with a country-made gun.
 
 According to forest officials, both Delvania and Sitapara were engaged in the diamond polishing industry in   town of Amreli. 
 
 On May 5, dramatic scenes were witnessed as one of the poachers had shot dead a chinkara right in front of the team of forest officials even as two managed to flee into   forest taking advantage of the dark. While one of the alleged poacher was nabbed, two of his accomplices (who were arrested on Monday) managed to give foresters the slip and escaped into the dark.
 
 “We want to give strong message to those violating wildlife rules. All three accused have been arrested for killing Schedule-1 animal and they will be prosecuted according to law,” said Dr T Karuppasamy, deputy conservator of forest Gir (east) division.
 
 According to the forest department sources, Delvania and Sitapara were involved in poaching since past 2-3 years. The accused had fled after the incident of May 5 and it was difficult for the forest department to trace them. But when they returned to the village assuming that the matter was put to rest, forest officials arrested them. 
 
 The accused will be prosecuted under various Sections of the Indian Wild Life Protection Act, 1967. The forest department is also investigating if others were involved in poaching.
