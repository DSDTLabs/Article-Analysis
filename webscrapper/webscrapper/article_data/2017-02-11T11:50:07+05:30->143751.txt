KOLHAPUR: The municipal corporation will take help from the   (NEERI), Nagpur, to plan, design and estimate the project to set up a sewage treatment plant to address pollution of Rankala lake. 

 During the hearing of a petition filed by city-based activist   over the apathy of the civic administration towards pollution of the lake spread over 200 acres, the   on Friday questioned the delay in issuing tenders for setting up the  . 
 
 The KMC’s counsel said that they have approached the NEERI to plan, design and estimate a sewage treatment plant of 10 million litres capacity. 
 
 Kemble had filed the petition one-and-a-half years ago. The court had asked the KMC to submit the plan to address pollution of the lake and the civic body presented the details of the project approved by the state government to address drainage-related issues in the city, Kemble said. 
 
 Kemble, who appeared for himself in the court, said, “The direction to the civic body to speed up the administrative process will realise our fight for a pollution-free lake.”
 
 The KMC tabled a notification issued by the state government on February 8 regarding release of Rs 72 crore grant for drainage works proposed under the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT).
 
 The KMC had first drafted a Rs 165-crore proposal. However, Kemble had argued that most of the works proposed in the plan are unnecessary and will not address the issue of pollution directly. Consequently, the court had asked the civic authorities to come up with a plan to set up the treatment plant and direct the sewage flow away from Rankala lake. 
 
 It is now expected that the NEERI will undertake the survey of the lake in the next couple of days and will initiate drafting of the plan. The court has asked the KMC to report the progress of tendering process on February 23, Kemble said. 
 
 Justice U D Salvi presided over the hearing.
