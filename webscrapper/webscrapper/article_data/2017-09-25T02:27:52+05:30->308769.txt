HYDERABAD:   (ASJ), a coalition comprising groups that back research scholar  , who committed suicide in 2016, has won a landmark student election at the  .

 After their win, the group has vowed to secure justice for Vemula, who committed suicide in January 2016.
 
 The alliance has as members the Students Federation of India (SFI), Dalit Students’ Union (DSU), and Ambedkar Students’ Association (ASA), among other smaller groups. It won five of six seats. 
 
 The results are a setback to   (ABVP), which had contested all the seats and was hoping to gain a foothold in the students’ union due to its growing influence on the campus. The ASJ candidate was leading in the sixth seat in the counting but the result was not declared due to a technical error, UoH authorities said in a statement. Sources said the winning candidate had low attendance.
 
 It was a tiff with ABVP members that led Vemula and four fellow students to be expelled from hostel.
 
 “It’s a victory against BJP and its efforts to saffronise universities across the country,” said Kuldeep Singh Nagi, vice-president of SFI’s UoH unit. “We will work together to take forward Vemula’s dream,” said Munna Sanaki, convener of ASA.
 
 From 2009-2011, ASA and SFI have fought together as an alliance, but failed to address the issues faced by poor Dalit students on campus. This is the first time all the Dalit, Adivasi and Muslim student groups fought the elections together. The alliance is now lining up several protest meets on campus and will also talk to other groups in various varsities across the country to “secure justice for Vemula”.
 
 They are particularly angry about a probe by the Centre that not only gave a clean chit to vice-chancellor Appa Rao Podile and former Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya, who reportedly intervened in the dispute on ABVP’s behalf, but also “concluded” that Vemula might not be a Dalit and was an OBC. His family denies the charges.
