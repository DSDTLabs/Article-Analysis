If the sartorial choices of all the Tollywood stars who’ve turned up at Abkari Bhavan for “grilling sessions” by the   so far are anything to go by, one thing is clear: Women are ‘cooler’ than the men! At least that’s what colour theory suggests. Looks like it isn’t purely a matter of coincidence that led all the men to chose vanilla white while the ladies picked cool blues. While all the men starting with   turned up wearing white shirts, the ladies —   turned up in a salwar kameez,   sported a hoodie — stuck to blue. “White signifies purity, innocence, simplicity and inner beauty. Which is why we see politicians, doctors etc wear them traditionally. Blue on the other hand is a much cooler colour that stands for tranquillity, relaxation and order. That’s the reason we artists are taught to use blue when depicting rain, change of seasons and sky, in college,” says artist  . 
So are all the actors trying to send out subliminal messages through their clothes? ‘Definitely,” reckons city-based colour therapist Kaveri. “They say what you wear is a reflection of what you are. But many times it can also be a reflection of what you want people to believe you are. So even though they may be very anxious and worried on the inside, the actors could be choosing colours that suggest otherwise,” she adds. Well, are these stars leveraging colour theory to their advantage? Your guess is as good as ours.
