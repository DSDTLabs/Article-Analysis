KOLKATA: Sunday’s molest-and-assault at the posh M Bar Kitchen has prompted other city   to strengthen security and make the screening procedure more stringent to ensure safety of their guests.

 From refusing alcohol to inebriated guests to not letting the place get excessively crowded to deploying more women security guards, most club managements said they will take every measure to prevent a rerun of Sunday’s incident.
 
 Tipsy Bull, the gastropub in   that is a favourite among the city’s young crowd, has introduced a new rule. “We will not serve drinks to anyone who, according to us, is already intoxicated and behaving inappropriately,” said owner  . The Great Booze Story on   already has very stringent screening procedures in place. “We do not let our place get overcrowded. The security is also tight,” said partner  .
 
 Many recent instances of lawlessness and violations at city bars and clubs have forced owners to sit up and take note, as such incidents affect business adversely. “In the age of social media, news travels like wildfire. It can make or break a place. No owner wants his place to get a bad name. He cannot afford to because once partygoers hear of it, they will start avoiding it,” said a New Town lounge owner.
 
 Many establishments are contemplating blacklisting troublemakers, but that plan is in a nascent stage. “The managements of all clubs have to be on the same page for this. In this competitive market, nobody wants to lose out on customers,” said the CEO of a hotel that also has a very popular resto-pub.
