HYDERABAD: The appointment of 188 home guards as constables under   (OC) despite scoring less than cut-off marks was stayed by the   on Monday till the final verdict.

 The HC directed the Telangana government and police recruitment board not to issue appointment letters to anyone with less than the cut-off marks in OC, but allowed it to go ahead with selection and appointment of candidates in other categories. 
 
 A bench of ACJ Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice Shameem Akther gave the interim order in a PIL by B   questioning discrepancies in the current recruitment. Even in the home guards' case, those who come under SC, ST and BC category can be appointed as constables if they secure the cut-off marks fixed for those communities under the quotas earmarked for them. But they cannot be brought under the open category, the bench said.
 
 Though advocate general   tried to defend the state's action, the bench agreed with the doubts raised by senior counsel S Satyam Reddy and sought a detailed counter from the state. HC has posted the case for two weeks later.
