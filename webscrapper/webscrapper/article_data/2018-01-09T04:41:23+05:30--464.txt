MUMBAI: In the first such case, the   on Monday paid a compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the husband of a tribal woman who died after a tubectomy operation in 2011. 

  The woman's husband Mansingh Gavit had knocked at the doors of the Nandurbar District Consumer Redressal forum for payment of compensation. On June 4, 2015, the forum asked the public health department to pay a Rs 2 lakh compensation to the husband within a month from the date of the order. 
 
  When the department, led by senior   leader Deepak Sawant, failed to pay the compensation, the forum on October 25, 2017 directed the department to immediately release the entire compensation with an interest of Rs 24,000. 
 
  A senior official said as per the forum's directive, a cheque of Rs 2.04 lakh was released to Gavit on Monday. "Immediately after the death, Rs 20,000 was paid to Gavit. Now, as per the forum's directive, the remaining amount of Rs 2.04 lakh has been paid and will be deposited in Gavit's Aadhaar-linked bank account," the official said. This is the first time in the history of the public health department that relatives of a deceased have approached the consumer court for payment of compensation, claimed the official. 
 
  "Our performance in family planning operations is excellent. The death rate is minimum compared to any other state. Annually, we perform more than five lakh operations, while the number of deaths during the procedure is less than 10. Our target is zero death," he said.
