AHMEDABAD: The used car market seems to have hit a   (GST) roadblock this  . With used cars taxed at par with new ones under the new tax regime, the sales of second-hand cars in the Ahmedabad have fallen by 30% the festive season, which is considered auspicious for vehicle purchases.

 “Pre-owned car sales volume has declined by 30% compared to Navratri last year,” said Jainish  , an official at a car dealership in the city. Market estimates suggest an average of 5,500-6,000 used cars were sold every month in Ahmedabad and that number has come down to 3,500 to 4,000 units this month.
 
 According to dealers, higher GST rates have adversely affected sales. Under the new tax regime, pre-owned cars attract 28% GST plus cess, which has narrowed buyers’ budgets. Under GST, a customer has to pay 28% GST and additional cess depending upon engine capacity. Before GST, a customer had to pay 1% VAT till a maximum up to Rs 2,000 for used cars.
 
 Although the prices of pre-owned cars have not yet fallen, dealers say buyers will opt for cheaper cars to offset the impact of GST to an extent. “A customer who has a budget of Rs 4 lakh will go for a lower segment car because of GST,” added Prajapati.
 
 There are customers who change vehicles every 2-3 years and they prefer certified used cars. Those who want a second car at lower costs also go for used cars. “These types of customers changed their minds this year and avoided buying cars because of budget constraints,” said one car dealer, who requested not to be named.
 
 There is still a lot of confusion about the GST structure on pre-owned cars. Dealers are not clear whether they have to pay tax on the invoice amount or the margin they make. Chartered accountant Karim Lakhani said, “The central government declared that used car dealers have to pay GST on the margin amount only, but I don’t see any kind mechanism so far that has evolved to that effect. The government should come out with FAQs for educational purposes.”
