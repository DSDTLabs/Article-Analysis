LUCKNOW: The   (AIMPLB) has decided to approach   over the triple talaq bill.

 The Board fears the central government may bring an ordinance on the Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage bill, 2017, if it fails to get it passed in the Rajya Sabha. The Lok Sabha has already passed the bill.
 
 “We think the government might bring in an ordinance and if it does so the haste will only prove that the government is against democratic process. It will be against the spirit of the constitution. Which is why we are seeking to meet the President on the issue,” said AIMPLB spokesperson Maulana Khalilur Rahmad Sajjad Nomani.
 
 The Board has also requested opposition leaders to appeal to the President not to sign any such ordinance if it is sent to him, said Nomani.
 
 AIMPLB has, however, clarified that it is not against the bill but opposes its certain provisions. “There should be a strong law against the practice of instant triple talaq, but it has major lacunae which need to be resolved in consultation with genuine organisations working on the issue of triple talaq. AIMPLB being the apex Muslim representative organisation should be consulted,” he said.
 
 According to AIMPLB, the provisions of the bill are  , against Sharia and interfere in the Muslim personal law, all of which will affect the welfare of the Muslim family. The Board added that some provisions of the bill are an attempt by the BJP government to fill jails with Muslim men.
 
 The Board said that the definition of the word ‘talaq’ in the bill takes into account all forms of divorce over and above instant triple talaq, thus criminalising all forms. It has also objected to third party interference and complaint in a case of an alleged instant triple talaq, which will initiate police action against the husband on any person’s complaint.
