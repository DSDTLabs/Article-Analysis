BENGALURU: Taking a dig at BJP leaders for trying to woo former Union minister S M Krishna into their party, JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy said they were being “opportunistic and playing mind games with voters’’.

 Kumaraswamy said on Thursday: “BJP leaders have been claiming that Krishna’s political experience and seniority is very valuable to them, and it would strengthen the party in the state. But it is ironical, given the fact that they have sidelined party veteran L K Advani, who has vast political experiences.” Kumaraswamy’s comment comes in the backdrop of claims made by state BJP leaders   and C T Ravi on how Krishna’s entry into the party would enhance its popularity ratings at the hustings.
 
 “They have neither considered Advani’s seniority or experience, they have just dumped him in the waste bin. But they are now talking about utilizing Krishna’s experience. This double-standard only reflects BJP’s culture.”
 
 He also lashed out at the Congress for trying to poach the JD(S) candidate for the Nanjanud assembly bypoll which has been necessitated after senior Dalit leader   quit the Congress recently. The Congress is struggling to find a candidate in that constituency, he said and added: “The Congress is losing ground in the state. Going by the political developments in the state, my intuition is that assembly polls in Karnataka will happen in the next six to eight months.”
