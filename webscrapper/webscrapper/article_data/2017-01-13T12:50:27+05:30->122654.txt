PANAJI: The question still lingers whether the   and the   (MGP) form a post poll alliance. Union minister of road, surface and transport and BJP incharge of Goa elections Nitin Gadkari said politics is a “game of contradiction, compulsion and limitation”, at a   on Thursday.

 “Anything can happen in cricket and politics, but this doesn't mean that it will happen here. First of all, we are confident that we will win more than what we did the last time,” Gadkari said, even as he admitted that MGP leader Ramkrishna Dhavalikar is his good friend.
 
 MGP parted ways with BJP earlier this month, after chief minister   dropped the Dhavalikar brothers from the cabinet.
