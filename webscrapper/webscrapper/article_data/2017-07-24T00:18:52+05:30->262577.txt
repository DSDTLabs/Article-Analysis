THANE: The month-long   social media   launched by three environmental  , coupled with the beefed up   by   and  , resulted in a 90 per cent drop in the number of people entering the Yeoor forest to celebrate Gatari on Sunday.

 While green warriors and forest officials have been urging citizens to refrain from celebrating this day in the green zone as they often leave behind tonnes of waste, plastic and broken bottles, the corners and niches of this forest has seen thousands of revellers flocking to it on this day every year.
 
 On Gatari last year, as many as 1,200 to 1,300 revellers made their way into the forest zone and many ended up drinking and littering around the village as well as the inner forest stretches. While forest officials, police as well as the team of 40 volunteers from NGOs — Thanekars, Thane Matadata Jagran Abhiyan and the umbrella of enviro groups, together called the Yeoor Environmental Society (YES) — were prepared to deal with a similar crowd this year, they were pleasantly surprised to see the number of revellers drop by over 90 per cent.
 
 “Like every year, we conduct a very strict check of all the vehicles entering the forest gate to make sure no alcohol is taken in. The police officials and NGOs have also helped us in this process by monitoring not only the periphery of the forest, but also the internal forest areas. We would spend the entire day asking people to leave and reporting them to the excise and police in the past. This year, we saw only two trespassers and very few cars entering the only gate to Yeoor,” said Sanjay Waghmode, range forest officer, Yeoor.
