DEHRADUN : Almost 15 years after a woman's breast was removed by surgeons who went solely by a wrong pathology lab report that the patient had cancer, a consumer court has ordered close to Rs 19 lakh in compensation for the "victim of gross negligence". 

  The Uttarakhand state consumer disputes redressal commission has held the Dehradun-based pathology and imaging centre guilty of erroneously concluding that the patient had breast cancer. Based on the diagnosis, doctors at the   (RGCIRC) in Delhi had conducted a surgery on the patient and removed her left breast only to find out that there was no cancerous growth. 
 
 
 
  Terming this to be a case of gross medical negligence which led to a lot of mental agony for the patient and her family, the commission directed Dr Ahuja's Pathology and Imaging Centre run by Dr   to pay compensation of Rs 10 lakh along with 7% interest (to be calculated from April 29, 2006, the date of filing of the consumer complaint, till payment is made) along with Rs 10,000 as litigation expenses. The total compensation amount including interest comes to around Rs 18.5 lakh. 
 
  The judgement given by Justice BS Verma, president of the commission, and Veena Sharma, a member of the commission, was delivered on March 13 and a written order was issued a few days later. The case pertained to Yashoda Goyal, a resident of Karanpur in Dehradun who in May 2003 was diagnosed as having infiltrating ductal carcinoma (a form of breast cancer) by Dr Ahuja's path lab. After the diagnosis, she consulted doctors at RGCIRC who advised surgery based on her reports.
