Bathinda: Muktsar district has started gearing up for the first edition of marathon to be flagged off by ‘Flying Sikh’ Milkha Singh on March 18 at Gidderbaha. 
 
 Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday released a poster and T-shirt of the event. 
  
 The marathon, to be organised by the District Olympic Association, will pass through four villages after starting from Gidderbaha. The aim of organising marathon is to involve youths in constructive things and making them to shun drugs. 
  
 Muktsar deputy commissioner Sumeet Jarangal said the district administration has set a target to involve nearly 10,000 youths in the marathon and has approached national-level sportspersons too to bring star value to the event. The marathon will be held in three categories — 21-km half marathon, 10km as the competitive race and 5km as the health run. 
  
 The half marathon will be for those above 18 years of age, 10km race for those above 15 years and the 5km race for those above 12 years of age. There will be total cash prizes of Rs 13 lakh. Noted Punjabi singer Gurdas Mann will perform on the occasion. 
  
 Former Indian men’s hockey team captain and Gidderbaha deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Rajpal Singh said, “Though I have represented India in hockey, I am very excited about this marathon being organised in a semi-rural area.”
