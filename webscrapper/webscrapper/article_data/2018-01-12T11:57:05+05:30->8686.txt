CHANDIGARH: Aiming to enhance citizen centric services through e-governance system, the local government department has decided to implement online building plan approval system in all the municipal bodies of the state by July end. Local government minister   Singh   said on Thursday that “Online Building Plan Approval System” would be provided to the town planning wing to ensure that a building proponent does not require visiting any of the offices. He added submission of building plans in hard copy version would be entirely done away with.

 Sidhu added a single system to manage the electronic building plan approval workflow and the electronic storage of relevant documentation would be implemented and public access to the electronic building plan approval system across the department would be facilitated. He said scrutiny of drawing would ensure that the building plan conformed to all regulatory and statutory norms, rules and regulations and time consuming manual verification would be reduced. He said the status of service would be notified at regular intervals.
 
 To start this initiative, the minister said, request for proposal (RFP) has been floated by the department which was available on the state government website. The service provider will be finalized in the month of February and by July the system will be operational in all the urban local bodies.
