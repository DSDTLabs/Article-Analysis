New   of   have been brought to the   in   against a professor who had allegedly sent lewd messages to a student earlier. Sources said the ICC has started inquiry in the cases, though no FIRs have been filed yet.

 A college source said, “We have received several complaints over the past few days as many other students have come out against the accused teacher. We have now initiated a probe as our ICC is now completely constitutional. We have now the mandatory 3 student members required to be part of the committee.” An investigation committee has been formed within the ICC which will start hearing the cases soon, the source added.
 
 Interestingly, the ICC in the college was also constituted in the span of one week, after the video of students confronting her teacher made rounds in the college. The student had also alleged that that she was being intimidated by the college authorities to keep the matter under wraps. TNN
