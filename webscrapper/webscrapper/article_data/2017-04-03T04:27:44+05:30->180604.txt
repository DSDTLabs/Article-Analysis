New Delhi: Flat allottees of the 2014 housing scheme are planning to file a court case against   ( ) for allegedly selling them EWS flats as LIG/one-room apartments. The residents also said that the land-owing agency has failed to provide them basic infrastructure even after two years of getting possession of the flats.

 Residents of   and   flats held a meeting on Sunday to discuss the two crucial issues. The trigger for this meeting was DDA’s recent proposal to rehabilitate 1000-odd   slum dwellers in flats returned by allottees in Rohini or Narela, which was recently reported by TOI.
 
 Though no final decision has been taken yet, residents fear that DDA will shift them there despite their strong opposition.
 
 “They sold us the flats mentioning them as one-room/LIG apartments. Now they want to give the same houses to slum dwellers under the EWS category. How can they change the category as per their convenience?” said Pratap Singh, a resident of DDA flats in Narela G-2.
 
 The residents of DDA flats in Rohini’s sectors 34 and 35 are opposing the move as they fear that this will affect the value of their flats. They had expressed their concerns to DDA vice-chairman Udai Pratap Singh and even written to Union minister of housing and urban poverty alleviation Venkaiah Naidu and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to register their protest.
 
 The allottees said that there is no main road connecting the societies, no streetlights, no regular supply of water and no shops, among other problems. “How do they expect us to live here? They took Rs 17 lakh from us, but have done little for providing basic services. We are planning to approach the court as we feel cheated,” said Vaibhav Puggal, president of Pocket 5, Sector 35 RWA.
