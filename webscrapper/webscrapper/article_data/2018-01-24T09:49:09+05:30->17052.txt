AHMEDABAD: At least 200 vehicles and eight shops were damaged when mobs affiliated to Rajput outfits unleashed arson and violence on Tuesday night on five multiplexes that had insisted on screening ‘Padmaavat’. In all, more than 50 vehicles were set ablaze. 

 The   government’s claims of increased security at multiplexes went up in flames as   footage showed the audacity with which protesters took the law into their hands. Ahmedabad fire and emergency services (AFES) teams were sent to multiple locations to tackle blazes. 
 
 Many areas of the city plunged into lawlessness as mobs attacked shops, torched vehicles and pelted stones at Wide Angle and Gulmohar Park Mall in Satellite, PVR Cinemas at Acropolis, Himalaya Mall on   and Ahmedabad One Mall in Vastrapur. The fire spread to eight shops outside Himalaya Mall. 
 
 Cops were seen swinging into action only after the mobs had unleashed unprecedented violence on cinema halls. Police fired two rounds in the air outside Himalaya Mall, which reported maximum damage to vehicles and property, to scare off the miscreants.
