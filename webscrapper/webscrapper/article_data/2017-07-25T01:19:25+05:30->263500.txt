 While the presence of police personnel at all vantage points across the city, a number of motorists chose to violate the law and celebrate gatari amvasya, before the month-long abstinence from meat and drinks.
 
  “Many motorists and bikers are undeterred by the heavy fine or fear of punishment and continue to drive under the influence of alcohol. They refuse to understand that their drunken revelry can cost a life. This time we wanted to make sure that no one meets with an accident because of such people’s negligence and so we conducted special drives from Friday to Sunday,” said Anil Mangale, traffic police inspector.
 
 The police had stationed their teams at 36 check points in the Thane police commissionerate.
 
 “There are around 18 traffic units in the commissionerate and we had two check points in each unit. It was seen that most of the violators were below the age group of 45. A person who was drinking and driving without license was charged Rs 3,000, one with the license who was caught driving under the influence of alcohol was fined Rs 2,500 and it was seen to it that even if a pillion was drunk along with the driver, then he/she was charged Rs 2,000. Also, we do not allow the person to take their vehicle even if they pay the fine, unless someone else comes and takes it, or we confiscate it till the next day,” added Mangale.
 
 Along with the traffic police even the Vartak police station were conducting patrolling on the weekend around Upvan and Yeoor gate.
