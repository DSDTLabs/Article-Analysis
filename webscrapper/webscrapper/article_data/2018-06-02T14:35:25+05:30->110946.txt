NAGPUR: The   and Hospital (IGMCH) has overcome two of the major hurdles preventing   (MCI) from giving recognition to the college. It is gearing up to face the MCI inspection.

 
 The college’s new Resident Medical Officers (RMO) hostel is ready and has been handed over to the college. This was one of the major requirements under the MCI norms for recognition. “There were 86 rooms in the old hostel, and the new hostel has another 98 rooms. Now each resident can have a room to himself, and need not share room with others. The ladies hostel is already ready. So, hostel problem is completely solved now,” said Dr  , hospital medical superintendent.
 
 There was a crisis about class IV staff too, due to which the required cleanliness could not be maintained. But the state government has now given 220 class IV employees, who will work under the banner of the BVG company. Since the company would be handling the day to day matters of the cleanliness, the college and hospital authorities are happy. “We have to pay Rs3.8 crore annually to the company but as long as the hospital doesn’t have to bother about daily work, it is a good contract,” said Dr Manjrekar.
 
 The company has given 178 class IV employees, 12 supervisors and 29 relievers and 1 manager. These will be covering the 200-bedded old hospital unit, the 250-bedded new unit and the  , casualty and emergency operation theatres. The old workers will take care of all other scattered areas. Dr Manjrekar said that the new employees will however be given all the required equipment available in the hospital, like automated floor cleaners etc
 
 Besides these, the hospital is also in the process of procuring various equipment required for MCI recognition.
