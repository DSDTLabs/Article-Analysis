LUCKNOW: On the lines of the village adoption programme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for MPs, the state cane development department has decided to toe a similar line. 

 However, unlike   where MPs oversee whether or not government schemes have reached their adopted village, the cane development ministry is planning to ask   to not only   a village each but to ensure its development under  . 
 
 As there are 116 functional sugar mills in the state, at least 116   could be developed this way. Cane development minister Suresh Rana has constituted a committee of three joint commissioners to identify backward villages throughout the state and prepare modalities on how these could be developed. Rana is planning for a May launch. 
 
 Directives have been given to identify backward villages in areas where sugar mills are situated, Rana told TOI. Every industrial unit has a provision to spend 2% of profit on CSR activity. 
 
 “We are not going to direct them but seek cooperation from them and request them to develop the adopted gradually through CSR,” Rana said. 
 
 The department would request mills to ensure toilets in schools, install solar lights, conduct cleanliness drive and install at least one RO plant in the village for drinking water. 
 
 As in the case of village adoption by MPs, sugar mills will also be asked to oversee whether all Centre and state-sponsored schemes are reaching the adopted village or not, Rana added. 
 
 After receiving the report of the committee in about a month, the cane development department would approach mills and request them to develop the identified villages, Rana said.
 
 At a time when sugar mills have failed to give cane dues to farmers for years, it would be interesting to see if mill owners would adhere to the minister’s request. 
 
 The UP government has decided that pending cane dues to farmers would be paid within 120 days while dues for the current fiscal are to be paid to farmers within 14 days.
