BHOPAL: A notification issued by the   ( ) on Thursday has shocked candidates appearing for the state services (mains) exam 2017. The commission has made Hindi essay mandatory for English medium candidates and also announced that students will have to cough up Rs 25,000 as late fee. The normal fee is Rs 800. 

 As per the notification, exams will be organised from June 3 to 8 this year. Students who are not from Hindi background said making the Hindi paper mandatory has put their entire preparations in trouble. 
 
 "I have been an English medium student. Essay is an important paper of the mains exams. Now, the commission wants us to write it in Hindi. How to learn writing essays in Hindi in such short span of time?" asked a candidate seeking anonymity. Another candidate said, "I am not able to understand the logic for making essay writing mandatory in a particular language. My result will be definitely affected." When contacted, the secretary of MPPSC, Renu Pant, said it is under the new set of guidelines that all candidates have to follow.
 
 Candidates also expressed their anger since the late fee has been increased exponentially. The commission has stated in its notification that candidates can submit their forms with a late fee of Rs 3,000 in between May 6 to May 12. 
 
 Students who do not submit within these dates can submit the form with a late fee of Rs 25,000 in between May 13 to May 26.
 
 "I have never seen such hike in late fees anywhere," said a candidate.
 
  "Several talented students come from humble backgrounds. Such a hefty hike in late fees does not make any sense. It is better to end the late fee facility," said Sidhhant Joshi, managing director of a private civil services coaching institute. 
 
 On the issue of increasing late fees, Pant said, "It has been noticed that despite giving ample time to submit their forms, many students do not follow instructions. Increasing the late fees is meant to discourage such candidates."
