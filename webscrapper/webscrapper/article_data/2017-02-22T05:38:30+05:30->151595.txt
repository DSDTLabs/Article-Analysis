 “We are going to attend the meeting with an open mind and will be listening to what the government has to say. So, we don't have anything specific to comment on.But if given an opportunity ,I will read out a speech outlining the views of the AHEI,“ said P Tondon, director of AHEI and CEO of  . He, however, added while AHEI members were ready to accept a regulatory body to screen hospital bills, they were denying the charge of overbilling. “There might have been aberrations but hospitals don't cheat. Every private hospital has its own cost structure and charging pattern that varies. So, this allegation is an unfair one,“ said Tondon.
 
 Colonel  , who will represent   at the meeting, said he will listen to what the government has to say. “It's not clear if we will be at all asked to speak.So, we are principally going there to find out what the government wants. We would definitely thank them for the security cover that has been provided to us over the years,“ said Bose.
