NEW DELHI: A   was busted for duping more than 500   across the country over the past two months by posing as customer care executives of State   of India. The gang operated from a call centre in Netaji Subhash Place of northwest Delhi and would call people in south and east India asking them for small investments with the bank. The money would be transferred to bank accounts owned by them.

 The accused have been identified as Arun Kumar (27), Kamal Kishor (28) and Arun Pratap (32). A case was registered on a complaint filed on behalf of SBI cards and payment services and a team led by ACP (Saraswati Vihar) Raja Banthia started investigations, DCP (northwest) Aslam Khan said.
 
 On March 10, cops got a tip-off about the location of Kumar and Kishor and they were nabbed. Kumar said that he, Kishor and Dharamveer registered a few companies, opened bank accounts and took a payment gateway. They then engaged three call centre operators — Manish, Saurabh and Pratap — who were told that 50% of the transaction amount would go to them.
 
 The call centre operators would call people and offer cards at a heavy discount. The membership ranged between Rs 8,000 and Rs 10,000. They would also promise to deliver a kit containing sports shoes, etc as well as hefty reward points on the cards. They would only call people living far away to deter them from filing a complaint for a small amount. The money would be transferred to the accounts of both companies through the payment gateways. Raids are on to nab the absconding gang members.
