JAIPUR:   Air-conditioning India will start production from its second plant located at the existing manufacturing facility in   from October this year with an annual capacity of six lakh units taking the total volume to 1.2 million units, said  , managing director and CEO of the company here.

 “We have stretched the capacity of our existing plant to 6 lakh ACs. The second plant, an expansion of the existing plant at Neemrana where we have invested an additional Rs 600 crore, will increase the volumes by another six lakh units taking the total volume 1.2 million ACs annually. Daikin India has been growing double the pace at which the industry is expanding. So, we needed the new capacity which will come on-stream from October this year,” said Jawa on the sidelines of introducing its 5.8 ISEER rated inverter ACs in   market.
 
 Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio (ISEER) is a new star rating introduced by the   (BEE) for air conditioners factoring in variance of higher temperatures in India.
 
 Jawa said Indian economy is estimated to grow at about 7% this year and generally the air-conditioning market grows double that rate. “That would translate to a growth of 12-15% for the AC industry. But as we have seen in the past, Daikin has been growing double the industry average and we expect about 25% growth in the current year,” added Jawa.
 
 Refuting the impression that Daikin ACs are costlier, Jawa said that had it been so, the company’s sales would not have risen from Rs 300 crore to Rs 3250 crore in the space of last seven years.
 
 “Daikin is not a price leader. We just want to give efficient ACs. In order to reach out to all segments of customers Daikin now has a four-tier pricing strategy. Over the years, the company in India has moved from eruption to disruption. Now, we are in an explosion stage,” added Jawa.
