KOLKATA: If all agencies make a concerted effort, land for a carshed at Joka for the Joka-BBD Bag Metro stretch would be available in three months, senior officials of the   ( ) said. Once this happens, trains would start running from Joka to   by June 2020. The   (KMC) has assured Metro Railway that the matter will be sorted out and convened a high level meeting on Saturday, to be attended by all stakeholders.

 
 
  
 
 
 “We require 25 hectares at Joka for the carshed. Of this, we only possess 52%, though 75% has officially been acquired. Construction can only start once we get the whole plot as the land we have is not contiguous. We hope agencies, including the KMC and landowners, cooperate for the completion of this project. The city will benefit from this line immensely as far flung areas near Joka would get connected to central Kolkata. There is also a 1,000sqm plot near Majerhat that will be required for the project,” a senior RVNL official said.
 
 Once the project is completed, people living along the Diamond Harbour Road, both in Behala and beyond would not only get to travel more comfortably and faster to central Kolkata, they would get linked to other lines, including the E-W Metro corridor and the one to Dum Dum (as well as the airport and   in the near future) through the interface at Esplanade. Traveling to places like Sector-V from Behala would take less than hour and the journey would be extremely comfortable, another official pointed out.
