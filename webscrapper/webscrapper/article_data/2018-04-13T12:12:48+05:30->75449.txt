VELLORE: Stating that the administration of the   has committed an “unfair labour practice,” the principal  ,  , has directed the university to reinstate 66   as   from the date of their termination.

 Hearing the plea filed by the workers seeking permanency, judge S Selvasundari on Thursday passed the order stating that they were “entitled to be made permanent as directly recruited by the respondent/university.” They should be absorbed as permanent employees from the date of their termination on November 5, 2013.
 
 The judge said the university had committed an unfair labour practice as defined in Part I of Schedule V of Industrial Dispute Act against the employees.
 
 On May 26, 2016, the court set aside the termination orders against 66 employees of the university by then vice-chancellor P Gunasekaran and directed it to reinstate them with 30% back wage, said retired professor I Elangovan, also the advocate of the Thiruvalluvar University Employees’ Union (TUEU). However, the university administration did not implement the order. It approached the Madras high court and appealed against the judgment. Justice S Vaithyanathan admitted the appeal directing either to reinstate the employees in service or give salary to the workers until the final verdict.
 
 The university agreed to pay. It has been paying a monthly salary of Rs 4.95lakh since November 2016 without giving them job.
 
 In the meantime, the employees’ union approached the court seeking permanency. “We approached the court following the verdict (May 26, 2016), seeking permanency to the employees,” Elangovan said, adding that Thursday’s verdict by the labour court redressed the grievance of the employees.
