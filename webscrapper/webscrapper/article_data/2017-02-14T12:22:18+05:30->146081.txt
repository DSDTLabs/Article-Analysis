 Zoo officials have sent a proposal to Rajkot and Visakhapatnam regarding the exchange. They have pitched for one male and one female tiger. "We have sent a proposal and we are awaiting a response. Since both zoos have white tigers and they need other animals, we are expecting a confirmation," Yadav said. Yadav said that there are certain protocols involved in the procedure, so it might take some time to get the approvals.Officials said that they were planning to send tigers to Rajkot zoo. Some other animals would be sent to Visakhapatnam in exchange for a white tiger.
 
 "In the zoo's master plan, a separate space has been allotted to construct an enclosure for white tigers. The work is set to begin soon," said Nihar Parulekar, curator and education officer,  .Indore zoo has a total of six tigers, however only one enclosure is suitable for keeping them. Another enclosure has been left empty after a tigress had earlier jumped out of it. 
 
 The zoo would have to shift two of its tigers to another zoo due to the lack of adequate space for the wild cats.
 
 A report of the central zoo authority has asked officials to shift the tigers temporarily. Zoo officials said they were planning to send the tigers to   by the end of this month. The ownership of the tigers would still remain with Indore zoo. Indore zoo has also made a commitment to send two tigers to Bhopal zoo under the programme as they had brought a white tiger from there earlier.
