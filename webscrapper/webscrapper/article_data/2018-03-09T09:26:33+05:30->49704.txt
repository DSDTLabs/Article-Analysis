SALEM: Following the   verdict on Thursday setting aside Kerala high court order that annulled her marriage, an elated Hadiya requested her parents to accept her husband   as their son-in-law. 

 “My husband called me from Delhi to inform that the Supreme Court had pronounced our marriage was legal and valid,” Hadiya told TOI. “I was overwhelmed with joy and happiness when my husband informed about the verdict,” she said. “My husband also expressed his happiness saying that we have succeeded in the case,” Hadiya said.
 
  Hadiya, who was at the center of controversial ‘Love Jihad’ case, has been continuing her internship in a private homoeopathy medical college and research institute near Sivadhapuram in Salem district.
 
 Shafin Jahan approached the Supreme Court challenging the Kerala high court order annulling his marriage with Hadiya, previously known as Akhila. A bench comprising Chief Justice   and Justices AM Khanwilkar and   heard the case. “She had married Shafin Jahan of her own free will and consent,” the apex court ruled. She thanked those who stood with her and prayed for her to be reunited with her husband. 
 
 Hadiya said she wished to start a happy life with Shafin Jahan in Kerala after completing her internship successfully. “Right now, he is working in a private company in Kollam. We don’t have any idea about our future but wish to live only in Kerala especially in Kollam,” she said.
 
 Hadiya said, “I don’t want to disown my parents before and after these issues. I wished to live with them and my husband.” She requested her parents to accept Shafin Jahan as their son-in-law. “I am just waiting for the last day of my internship. I wished to go Kerala once I complete my studies,” she added.
