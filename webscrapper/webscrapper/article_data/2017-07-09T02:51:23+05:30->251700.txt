NEW DELHI:   Rail Corporation (DMRC) is soon going to start work on extending the Airport Express Line to Dwarka  .

 At present, the high-speed Airport Express Line connects New Delhi station to   Sector 21 station, with four stations in between — Shivaji Stadium, Dhaula Kuan, Delhi Aerocity and   (Terminal 3). DMRC is now going to extend the corridor 1.5 km further to Dwarka Sector 25, connecting it to the upcoming exhibition-cum-convention centre of Dwarka.
 
 The project of extending the line is expected to begin soon and will cost around Rs 310 crore. The station, to be named ECC Centre, will be underground and will be connected to the line through a tunnel, which will be constructed through the ‘cut and cover’ method. DMRC expects to complete the project within two-and-a-half-years after construction begins.
 
 The exhibition and convention centre coming up in sector 25 of Dwarka is a major project and would be the first of its kind facility in west Delhi. The centre would be on the lines of both Pragati Maidan and India Habitat Centre. The state-of-the-art centre would be able to host seminars, conventions and large-scale exhibitions. DMRC was requested to extend the Airport Express Line to the exhibition-cum-convention centre to provide high-speed connectivity.
 
 With the Airport Express Line reaching the convention centre, it would be easier for people from across the city to reach there. Once the centre comes up, it expects to witness a huge footfall and it would result in an increase of passenger traffic on the Airport Express Line as well.
