Guntur/Sattenapalle: Tension prevailed in   town following attempts by leaders of ruling Telugu Desam Party ( ) and opposition YSRC for a showdown during a public debate here on Monday. 

 Guntur urban police kept   leader and Sattenapalle constituency in-charge Ambati Rambabu under house arrest in the city. Cops also detained TDP MLC Budha Venkanna near Chuttugunta centre in the city and shifted him to Inspection Bungalow. The police did not allow both leaders to move out of Guntur city to avoid trouble in Sattenapalle town.
 
 Trouble started with Ambati Rambabu challenging TDP leaders for a public debate over irregularities in implementation of welfare schemes on Sunday. Rambabu declared he would be available for a debate in Sattenapalle town on Monday. Accepting Rambabu’s challenge, MLC Budha Venkanna of Vijayawada city declared he will attend the debate and prove Rambabu’s campaign false. He said YSRC leaders are unable to accept the development initiated by speaker Kodela Sivaprasada Rao and are making baseless allegations.
 
 Tension escalated as both leaders geared up to travel to Sattenapalle from their destinations, on Monday. The police forcibly entered Rambabu’s residence and directed him not to venture out. Rambabu alleged the police were acting at the behest of TDP. Rambabu said crores of rupees of public money is being looted by the TDP leaders in the name of pensions and housing schemes. 
 
 Although the police detained leaders from rival camps, both parties took out rallies in Sattenapelle. Additional forces were moved into the town to handle the situation. TDP leader Dr Kodela Sivaram, said, “Ambati Rambabu is a non-local leader for Sattenapalle. He landed here after people of his local place Repalle chased him down for his failure to develop the constituency. Now he is trying to create unnecessary trouble in peaceful Sattenapalle.”
