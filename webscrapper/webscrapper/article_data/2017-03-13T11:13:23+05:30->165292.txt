PANAJI: Sunday morning was unusually nippy as the mercury dipped almost five degrees below normal to 18.5C, a couple of weeks into summer.

 The meteorological centre at Altinho,  , had recorded a minimum temperature of 21C on Thursday, 22C on Friday, but on Saturday the temperature dropped to 19.1C before Sunday’s dip to 4.7 below normal. During the mild winter season, the met centre had recorded lower minimum temperatures of 19C and on a few occasions it had dropped below 18C.
 
 A change in wind direction on the weekend triggered the chill in the wee hours. “Persistent northerly winds over the last couple of days have gradually brought down the minimum temperature,” assistant meteorologist N Haridasan said.
 
 The maximum temperature had risen to 34.3C on Thursday, 2.2 degrees below normal. It went down to 33.6C on Friday and 32.6C on Saturday. “This trend is likely to continue for a couple of days,” Haridasan said.
 
 Meteorological centre officials are keenly watching a trough from south   extending up to 0.9km above mean sea level.
