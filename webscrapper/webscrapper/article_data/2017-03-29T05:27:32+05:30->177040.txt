PUNE: The Indus Magic pilot plant at the   ( ), gutted in a major fire on Monday night, was part of an ambitious cluster programme of the   ( ) aimed at reducing the industry-research gap.

 The unit’s name, an acronym for innovate, develop and up-scale (Indus) modular, agile, intensified and continuous (Magic) processes and plants, was developed exclusively to innovate processes and equipment useful for chemical industries. 
 
 Inaugurated last February by Union minister Harsh Vardhan, the pilot plant benefitted small and medium chemical industries by providing processes and equipment suiting their needs. The annual turnover of the plant was Rs 13-15 crore. While the plant was established in 2006, its main work started in 2010. 
 
 S S Tambe, chief scientist, chemical engineering & process development, said, “The pilot plant is an intermediate facility between lab-scale experiment and a commercial plant. Small and medium chemical process industries and startups were big beneficiaries of this plant. A team of investors is assessing the extent of damage to the unit. Several projects were under way in the lab. We will know the repercussions of the damage only after the expert report comes in.”
 
 In an official statement, the NCL said, “A fire had broken out at pilot plant III lab Indus Magic at about 8pm on Monday. Seven fire tenders and two water tanks rushed to the spot. They localized the fire to a single building and it was put out by 9.15 pm. After the operation was about to be called off, fire broke out once again at 10.45 pm at one of the points on the ground floor of the PPIII lab, but was extinguished immediately.”
