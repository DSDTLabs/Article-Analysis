Vadodara: Dhruvin Shah, an accused in cash-for-marks scam, absconding since six months, was arrested on Thursday by anti-corruption bureau (ACB) after he surrendered before them at their office.

 Shah turned himself in on Thursday morning after withdrawing his anticipatory bail plea from Gujarat high court on Wednesday where his lawyer had assured the court that he will remain present before ACB on the next day.
 
 Shah was an aide of founder of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth, Mansukh Shah, who is currently behind bars in the same case. Interestingly, it had come on record in past during Shah’s anticipatory bail hearing in the sessions court of Vadodara that he was not absconding but was living at his home. In fact, the agency had even called him for questioning on March 18 but had not arrested him even though he was one of the accused.
 
 ACB sources said that Shah was Mansukh’s middleman and in this case he had pressurized the complainant to pay the bribe amount. Shah, a physiotherapist, is associated with Mansukh since long as, earlier, he used to work at Sumandeep Vidyapeeth and later worked as Mansukh’s aide, an ACB official said.
 
 When the entire scam was unearthed after the complaint was lodged by a student of the university in February this year, along with houses of Mansukh, his other aides Vinod alias Bharat Savant and Ashok Tailor, ACB sleuths had searched Shah’s house too.
 
 Before Shah had approached the high court after his anticipatory bail plea was rejected by the sessions court in June. The court had later issued an arrest warrant against him under section 70 of criminal procedure code.
 
 An ACB official said that they will present him before the sessions court on Friday to seek his custody. Shah’s lawyer Sohil Ghodia said, “The high court had directed to appear before the ACB between 11 am and 12 noon which Shah and the investigating officer arrested him as he deemed fit.”
