A 28-year-old Pune resident was arrested on Saturday for duping a Mumbai woman by posing as a software engineer on a matrimonial website and raping her after promising marriage. The police have come to know that the accused,  , who hails from Baramati, has conned and raped at least four more women using the same modus operandi. 

 The accused connected with the complainant, who is a software engineer, through a matrimonial website and told her that he was looking for a life partner working in the same field, the police said. After exchanging phone numbers, the duo started talking to each other regularly. "Jadhav told the woman he worked with an IT company in Hinjewadi in Pune and that he was going abroad for two years," said Arun More, inspector at   police station.
 
 The woman has told the police that the accused insisted they get engaged before he leaves India. "Jadhav called the woman to Ravet and raped her at a flat several times. He took money from her for his visa," More said.
 
 "About two months ago, Jadhav contacted the woman and told her that he wanted to end their relationship. When the woman asked him to return her money, Jadhav refused," More said.
 
  The woman then approached the police and lodged a complaint. More said that when the police arrested Jadhav, a woman was with him. "We found out that Jadhav had duped that woman too. However, she refused to lodge a complaint," he added. Jadhav has admitted to duping four more women, said More, adding that the accused is employed.
