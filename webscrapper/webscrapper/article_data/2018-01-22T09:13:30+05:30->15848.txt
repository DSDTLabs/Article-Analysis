GUWAHATI: The   held one of its largest congregations at the at a college field here on Sunday, with 50,000 people turning up to attend Mohan  's address. 

  Bhagwat said India had stopped considering Pakistan an enemy, but Pakistan had failed to do the same in its approach towards India. "Mohenjodaro and   civilizations are now in Pakistan. They are part of Bharat, which Pakistan does not want to acknowledge. Pakistan is a separate country because it did not want to accept Hindutva," Bhagwat said. 
 
  Extending the same logic to Bangladesh, he added, "Why is Bangladesh a separate country even though its people speak Bangla? It is because the country does not want to associate with Hindutva." According to Bhagwat, it is Hindutva that has "united India despite diversity of language, religion, lifestyle and custom". He added, "Hindutva accepts diversity, not divisions. That is why India is a Hindu rashtra." 
 
  The meeting was organised by the North Assam Zone, which covers Assam's Brahmaputra Valley, Nagaland and Meghalaya. Assam CM Sarbananda Sonowal and ministers from the state and tribal kings attended the congregation.
