 It was a   that brought all the biggies of the   Rail Corporation (DMRC) together. On Friday,   Managing Director Mangu Singh’s daughter, Neha Singh, a lawyer, tied the knot with Varun Shah, an engineer.

  
  
 The wedding was organised at a city hotel and since the groom is from Gujarat, the guests were served delicious Gujarati fare. 
 
  
  
 Talking about the new jodi, Neha’s elder sister Ritu Singh, said, “Everyone in my family is an engineer – dad, me, my younger sister, Annu – and dad wanted Neha to also be an engineer, but law interested her more. But now, she is marrying an engineer! He is from Gujarat.”
 
  
  
  
  The DMRC employees, directors and their family members, were also present at the wedding, but the chief guest of the evening was the Metro Man himself,  , who was wearing the DMRC’s official red tie. Though he stayed at the venue only for half an hour, he made sure to interact with the new couple. The DMRC MD was happy that   could make it to the wedding and he thanked him several times for the same. A DMRC official told us, “Sreedharan sir is an integral part of our DMRC family, he came from Kochi especially for the wedding.” Anuj Dayal, executive director, Corporate Communications, who was introducing Sreedharan to the guests, told us that this wedding was like a family get-together for them.
