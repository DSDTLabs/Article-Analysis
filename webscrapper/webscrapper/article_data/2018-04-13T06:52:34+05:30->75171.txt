LUCKNOW: Only licensed tobacco vendors will operate in the city from next month. Tobacco and cigarette sellers have time till   to seek a licence from   for an annual fee of up to Rs 5,000. 

    made the announcement on Thursday. As of now, there is no licence system and anyone can set up a tobacco or cigarette shop anywhere. 
 
  Along with NGO Vinoba Sewa Ashram, LMC organised a workshop to sensitise corporators and LMC staff about the guidelines of The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 (COPTA), which bans advertisement of and provides for regulation of trade and commerce of tobacco products. 
 
  The guidelines mention that no tobacco shop should be opened in the vicinity of religious places and in a 100-metre periphery of a school. They also ban sale of soft drinks and other snacks at tobacco shops. 
 
  Lucknow has seen tobacco shops mushrooming all over market and residential areas. 
 
  Municipal commissioner Uday Raj Singh said, "The guidelines should be adopted in the next 20 days. All vendors must seek licence from LMC at an annual fee of up to Rs 5,000. The fee might change marginally after the corporation comes up with a final fee structure. But from May, only licensed vendors will sell tobacco." 
 
  The commissioner has asked corporators to help LMC identify places where tobacco vendors are flouting COPTA in their wards. 
 
  A crackdown is in the offing on those operating near religious places or schools. 
 
  Corporators will also recommend areas which can be declared 'tobacco selling zones'. 
 
  "LMC will soon work out guidelines which limit the number of tobacco vendors at a spot. This will prevent encroachment, traffic chaos and also discourage the use of tobacco," said media coordinator of the NGO Vikram Mishra.
