 Kumar had closed the store around 7pm on Thursday. 
 
 Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-IV)   said, "The burglars gained entry by breaking the locks of grill installed on the rooftop. They had brought along an LPG cylinder to use gas cutters to open the locks. An empty cylinder was found on the roof. After entering the shop, they used another cylinder kept there to open the safe. They checked all jewellery and took the original one with them. The artificial jewellery was found broken." 
 
 The thieves were aware from where they could enter easily and that the shop had an LPG cylinder, he added.

 "The CCTV cameras installed in the shop had been non-functional since January 24," the SHO added. 
 
 Police had set up a checkpoint near the jewellery shop till 12.45am. The footage of a CCTV camera installed at a nearby shop showed that the lights at the jewellery store were on at 12.45am. The lights were switched off minutes after the cops left. It is suspected that the burglars were inside the shop when the cops were manning the checkpoint.
