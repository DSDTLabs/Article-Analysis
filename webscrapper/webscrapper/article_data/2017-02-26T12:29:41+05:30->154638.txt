 PMPML chief engineer Sunil Burse on Thursday said the system, known as   or  , will be introduced in 1,350 new buses this year.
 
 “PMPML is worried about the frequent fire incidents in the buses and a lot is being considered to avoid them.The PMPML fleet is being expanded. A total of 550   are set to arrive, of which 10 will be delivered next month. Also, 800   will join the fleet. All new buses will have a system to automatically control and extinguish fires,“ Burse said. At present, PMPML has 2,055 different kinds of buses.
 
 “The system is similar to those installed in commercial and residential buildings and skyscrapers. The buses will have sprinklers, which will start operating as soon as there is a fire. Passengers will have enough time to get out of the bus and authorities will also get time to inform the fire brigade, if necessary,“ Burse added.
 
 PMPML officials said other means to extinguish fires, which could be in the form of gas or foam, are also being contemplated. This could be useful in case of fires resulting from electric short circuits.
 
 “The system is expensive with each set up costing anything between Rs 2.50 lakh to Rs 3 lakh. However we need to introduce some systems for the safety of people,“ another official added.
