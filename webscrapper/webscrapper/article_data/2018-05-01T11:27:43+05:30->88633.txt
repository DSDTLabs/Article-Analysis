HYDERABAD: Chief minister   is talking about a Front at the national level only to make his son   the state chief minister after the next general elections,   spokesperson NV   said. “The chief minister, who cannot solve problems in the state, wants to rule the country. It is a bid to divert the attention of people from the state issues,” he said.

 
 Addressing a press meet with another spokesperson S Prakash Reddy, Subash alleged KCR, who vowed to form a Front with non-BJP and   parties, did a U-turn in Chennai on Sunday and termed this as ‘media hype’ because there was a lack of response from parties. He said KCR was going around various states like West Bengal and Chennai because he was power hungry.
 
 Subash said the CM does not have time to listen to people’s problems and does not even come to Secretariat.
