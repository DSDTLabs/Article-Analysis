BIJNOR:  , all in their teens, died after coming into contact with a high-tension wire while heading to   village on Wednesday.

 
 
  
  Villagers claimed that they had alerted the officials concerned about the snapped power cable but in vain.
  
  The deceased were identified as Mohammad Shariq (15), his brother Sadiq (14) and their cousin Mohammad Ashif (12), all hailing from Goyali village in Chandpur.
  
  According to sources, the boys were going to a mango orchard in Sikandarpur village to give food to their grandfather when they came in contact with a snapped high-tension power cable and died on the spot. Locals alerted the family members who later staged a protest on Chandpur-Nauganva Road along with other villagers disrupting traffic for four hours. Chandpur SDM Umesh Mishra, circle officer Rajkumar Singh and BJP MLA Kamlesh Saini met the family members of the deceased and offered condolences. Later, officials pacified the protesters by announcing a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to the victims’ families and assuring that the old power lines would be replaced soon.
  
  Meanwhile, Aman Kumar, whose tubewell was connected to the snapped line, said, “I had already deposited Rs 29,000 for the replacement of the line but no action has been taken so far. Now, officials are asking for more money.”
  
  Refuting the claims, Ajay Kumar, executive engineer of Chandpur division, said, “We had replaced all old wires except this one. In fact, we had no knowledge of this snapped line. We will look into the matter and take strict action against any erring officials.”
  
  C P Singh, superintending engineer of power corporation, said, “For the time being, we have given a monetary assistance of Rs 3 lakh. We will soon initiate a fair probe into the matter.”
  
  Recently, four farmers were   and another injured when they came in contact with low-hanging power cables in Bijnor’s Vijay Nangla village.
