 says he was not surprised when he found his late wife  's body. 

 The 26-year-old musician lost his wife in April 2014 after she passed away from a   overdose and he now says trying to keep a routine with their children -  , four, and  , three - only an hour after her death helped get him through the heartbreak.
 
  
  
 "When I found her, I was not surprised. I thought to myself at the moment, '  of course - you had to do that.' What I can remember, it must have been an hour after I found her, that it's time for the kids' lunch," Cohen says. 
 
 "They needed their lunch. So I took the children's chairs to the table, took the yoghurts out of the fridge, the bananas ... After that, we drove here."
