LUDHIANA: The police on Tuesday arrested a man for killing his brother with the help of his brother-in-law in   of Doraha. 

 Harpreet Singh, 32, along with his brother-in-law Simarjeet Singh, gave a drug overdose to Ramandeep Singh, 31, to become the sole owner of his family property, the police said. 
 
 Ramandeep was found dead at his house in Bishenpura village on the morning of April 14.
 
 Payal deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Rashpal Singh Dhindsa said, “In a police complaint, their cousin Jagtar Singh of Alaud, Amloh, pointed the finger of suspicion at Harpreet and Simarjeet. Ramandeep had four acres of farm land and was not married. As Harpreet was his only sibling, he would have been the sole beneficiary of Ramandeep’s property after him.”
 
 Harpreet and Simarjeet, also 32 had been under the scanner from Day One. “Simarjeet claimed that he found Ramandeep dead when he went to his house at 5am. Some documents, cards and the recordings of CCTV cameras installed at the house were missing. Simarjeet’s visit timings made police suspicious.” 
 
 The two were arrested from near Mallipur bridge on GT Road around 2pm. 
 
 Police said Simarjeet — a resident of Kaddo in Doraha — was on parole in a drug peddling case. “In the jail, Simarjeet had met Jaswinder Singh of Bhikhi, Maloud. After obtaining the drug from Jaswinder’s aide, the two tied up a drunk Ramandeep and gave him its overdose on the night of April 13. They later threw his body outside his house,” the cop added.
 
 The DSP said about five drug and liquor peddling cases were registered against Simarjeet. Jaswinder would be brought from jail on production warrant and booked.
 
 A case of murder and disappearance of evidence has been registered. 
 
 Harpreet and Ramandeep’s father was killed during terrorism in   in 1990s and their mother had been missing for the past five years.
