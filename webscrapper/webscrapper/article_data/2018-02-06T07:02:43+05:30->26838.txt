AMRITSAR: Hours after a sting video of former   MP Jagdish   allegedly revealing his role in the killings of 100s of Sikhs during the 1984 riots in Delhi was released, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee ( ) and the Shiromani Akali Dali (SAD) demanded his immediate arrest.

 “There is no need of any witness, inquiry or an investigation after the release of this video wherein Tytler himself has admitted killing 100 Sikhs,” SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said here on Monday. He also appealed to the Supreme Court to take suo moto notice of Tytler’s alleged “confession” and award strict punishment to him.
 
 The Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) released five video clips in which Tytler allegedly admitted to killing 100 Sikhs during the 1984 riots.
 
 However, Tytler claimed the videos were doctored. “These video clips are doctored and I wonder why no one came forward in all these years,” he said. How could someone claim to have killed 100 persons, Tytler asked and added he would file an FIR against the persons trying to malign his name.
 
 Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal too sought Tytler’s immediate arrest and registration of a fresh case to fix former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s role in the 1984 riots. “Tytler is clearly heard presenting the killing of the Sikhs as a ‘service rendered to  , his family and the Congress party in return for which, he claims, he is entitled to a special and highly respectable consideration,” alleged Badal.
