GHAZIABAD: Two separate protests, one supporting and the other opposing the flea market in  , were held here on Sunday. 

 The members of Navyug Market, including the shopkeepers, and the residents claimed that the weekly flea market blocks the vehicular movement in the area. The vendors, on the other hand, cried foul against the ban imposed on them for the past two months. 
 
 In the wake of the agitation, several markets including the Navyug Market, Navyug Mini Market, Sihani Gate Vyapar Mandal, Navyug Market Extension   and even   remained closed.
 
 According to the members of Navyug Market Vyapar Mandal, the Sunday flee market, considered to be the largest of its kind in NCR, has been a cause of concern for a long time. 
 
 Speaking to TOI,  , president, Navyug Market Vyapar Mandal and former councillor of the area said, “More than 2,000 makeshift shops in the flea market leave no space for vehicles. The market is being held since 1997. It’s not just the local vendors but vendors hailing from Deoband, Bijnor, Meerut, Hapur, Muzaffarnagar and Delhi sell their stuff here.”
 
 He added by saying, “They set up this market on at least 15 roads all over the area, and very recently they even occupied the service lane behind the residential flats. Once, a man died in an ambulance due to a traffic jam caused by the Sunday Market vendors.” The shopkeepers further complained that the weekly flea market also raises security concerns as the area has 27 banks, 20 ATMs, four currency chests of banks.
