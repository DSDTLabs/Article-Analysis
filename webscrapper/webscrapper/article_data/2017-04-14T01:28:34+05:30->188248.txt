GHAZIABAD: GMC mayor   launched eight new   which will be deployed in major public places and intersections around Ghaziabad district on Thursday. 

 The machines will be kept in major public areas including Ghantaghar Chowk, Navyug Market and the Collectorate, among others. 
 
 The machines called ‘Pilo’ have already been operating outside various Metro stations across Delhi, Noida and in Ghaziabad too. 
 
 “All these machine have water that is tested by laboratories and everytime they’re switched on they will reflect the purity level of the water on the screen. All of them are attached with solar panels on the top, which can charge the machines overnight and they can be used all day,” said Verma.
 
 “A lot of people cannot afford to purchase packaged drinking water. The plastic pouches also cause a lot of non-biodegradable pollution. But these machines, which dispense a glass full of cold, good quality water for just Rs 2 will be a boon for the residents of Ghaziabad ahead of the scorching heat this summer.”
 
 The Mayor also added that the   is aiming at making Ghaziabad district the first plastic bottle free district in Uttar Pradesh. 
 
 "We will track the progress and the response of these machines and we will increase their number with time as per requirement," added Verma.
