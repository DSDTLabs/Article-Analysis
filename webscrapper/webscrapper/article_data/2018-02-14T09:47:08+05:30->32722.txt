LUDHIANA: The father of the martyred soldier, after whom the village school — which hit the headlines following the rape and abortion of a student — has been named, has asked the education department to change all the staff members of the institute. He says the staff was aware of the incident, but kept mum. 

 The village residents, too, have come out in his support. On Tuesday, the 75-year-old, along with the villagers, met deputy district education officer (secondary)   and gave him a memorandum. 
 
 The martyr’s father said, “The school has been named after my son, who sacrificed his life during the Kargil war. The rape and abortion incident has sullied my son’s name. The entire school staff was aware of the incident, but none took it up with the authorities. This makes them equally guilty of the crime. I have urged the education department to change the school staff.” 
 
 Ravinder Singh, an alumnus of the school, said, “The incident has shocked the village. We are now worried about our youth. Therefore, we have given a memorandum to the education officer, seeking change of the entire school staff.”
 
 Another villager Sukhveer Singh said, “We are worried about the safety of our children who study there. We do not trust these teachers.” 
 
 Deputy district education officer (secondary)   said, “We have received their memorandum and will take up the issue with the higher authorities.” 
 
 The police have already arrested three of the   .one for violating his student and the other two for conspiracy.
