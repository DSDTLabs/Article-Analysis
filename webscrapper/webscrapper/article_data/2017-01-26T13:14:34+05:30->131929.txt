RANCHI : With 90% of the   from   coming to a close, the school education and   has discovered several  .

 During the seeding process, it was discovered that several schools in the state consisted of very less students and the   is more than required. Some schools with only five to 10 pupils enrolled have over 10 teachers, while on the other hand, schools having hundreds of students have only two-three teachers.
 
 Project director of Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) Mukesh Kumar said, "The schools with a few number of students have been merged with another school in the vicinity. As of now, we have decided to merge 1,200 such schools. The number might increase once the Aadhaar seeding is complete."
 
 The seeding process also helped the department to identify ghost enrolments and double enrolments in government schools. "There are at least two lakh cases of ghost enrolment but a clear picture will emerge only after the final aadhaar verification is done," Kumar said.
 
 Two major kinds of discrepancies were seen in the enrolment system. "There were some students who have enrolled in two schools at the same time while there are some who have enrolled themselves but do not attend classes in the schools," Kumar said.
 
 Explaining the reason behind double enrolment, Kumar said it gave children double benefit. "They would get everything in two sets, including uniform, books, stipend and much more if they are enrolled in two schools. Also, in many cases, teachers also put in ghost enrolments to achieve the target enrolment in their schools," he said.
 
 The Aadhaar seeding is being done at war footing for the past six months by the department. The process will help the department link the bank account of children with their aadhaar, so they can avail the facility of direct benefit transfer.
