MAPUSA:   police have attached a stamp belonging to the office of the Bardez mamlatdar, and a hard disk from a photocopy centre at Mapusa, in connection with an alleged   scam. 

 The circle officer of the Bardez mamlatdar’s office had complained that a bogus residence certificate was produced by one Sunita   before the Bardez mamlatdar, Dashrath  . An inquiry by revenue officers revealed that the certificate issued to Shende was not genuine as the signature it bore didn’t belong to Gawas. There were also no corresponding entries in the office’s inward and outward registers.
 
 During subsequent investigations by the police, it was found that the certificate was given to Shende by  , a resident of Mapusa, who worked as domestic help at several homes. Thorat was held for forgery and remanded to 10 days in police custody. After interrogating her,  , a Camurlim resident, was held. It was found that Palyekar would print residence certificates at a photocopy centre in Mapusa, get them stamped at the mamlatdar’s office and hand them to Thorat. Police have registered an offence under IPC Sections 465, 468 and 420.
