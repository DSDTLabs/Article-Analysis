PUNE: Residents of Scrum Utkarsh, which is under the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) scanner, are confused and worried as well despite taking all legal steps to build their homes.

 About 85 software professionals and their families staying in the society are facing eviction after the ED, Mumbai, served the eviction notices.
 
 From the plan sanctioning authority, legal experts and banks, all seem to have given a green signal to the project. Banks typically initiate their search report before sanctioning any loan. In this case, two banks —   Bank and   (SBI) — have sanctioned most of the loans. It was possibly because no document reflected the status of ED attachment on the land.
 
  
 An email sent to IDBI and SBI remained unanswered, despite attempts to reach the two banks for over 24 hours. The queries were acknowledged, but the two banks did not respond till the time of going to press.
 
 Before starting the construction,   members took permissions from the   and town planning authorities. They then took a bank loan of over Rs 18 crore for the construction.
 
 Housing society director Pravin   told TOI. “We searched the land and a property agent, who too has been booked in the case, showed us the plot and gave its documents to us.”
 
 The society then hired a lawyer to study the legal documents. The advocate’s search report stated that it was a “clean” land, Gurav said, adding that the government’s land records and documents also did not show any adverse remark.
 
 “All documents were handed to the town planning department and it gave the nod on May 30, 2014. The same documents were produced to PMRDA and the nod came on June 19, 2015,” Gurav said.
 
 Shivprasad Satpute, a partner in the Hindavi Swarajya Corporation Pvt Ltd, said the society paid non-agricultural fees to the   gram panchayat for the construction.
 
 The ED has so far refused comment on the development and said the “law will take its course”.
