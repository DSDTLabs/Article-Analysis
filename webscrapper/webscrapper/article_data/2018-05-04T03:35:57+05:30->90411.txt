KENDRAPADA: A court in Odisha’s   district ordered police on Thursday to register a criminal case against   “Jay” Panda, dissident BJD MP from Kendrapada, for allegedly filing an incorrect affidavit during the 2014 general election. 

 
 The court of the sub-divisional judicial magistrate gave the order on a plea filed by one Dilip Kumar Das. Das had filed a complaint on Tuesday against Panda in the SDJM’s court for allegedly submitting a “false” affidavit while filing his nomination papers for the   seat four years ago. 
 
 Das said Panda misled the public by concealing the fact that he drew crores in salary and allowances as vice-president of Indian Metals & Ferro Alloys Ltd. When contacted, Panda’s secretary, Jyoti Ghose, said, “The case is sub judice. The law will take its own course.” This is not the first case against the MP. On March 15, Gopal Charna Lenka had filed a case against him on the same matter.
