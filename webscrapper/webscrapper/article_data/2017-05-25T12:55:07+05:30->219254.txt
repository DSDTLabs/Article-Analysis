LUCKNOW: Did   administration ignore the warning from the   about the fallout of former CM Mayawati’s visit to the trouble-hit district? Intelligence department sources told TOI that two days before the proposed visit, the government and the local administration that if   visited Saharanpur, there were strong chances of another clash. “But district administration did not take preventive action,” they say.

 “Had district administration been alert, Tuesday’s violence could have been alerted,” said a senior officer in home department. Mayawati had sought permission to go to Saharanpur by   to visit the troubled village but district administration allowed her only to go by road. There was huge turnout of Dalits protesting against the BJP government’s “failure” to act against the members of the Rajput community accused of sectarian violence.
 
 The intelligence officials also express surprise over the appointment of Subhash Chandra Dubey as the SSP in the trouble-hit district last month. “Who advised the chief minister to depute Dubey, who was indicted for his inept handling of the situation during Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013,” they ask. After May 5 violence, the caste clashes were in fact subsiding when a visit by Mayawati triggered clashes among Rajputs and Dalit in which one person was killed.
 
  is threatening to dent the image of chief minister Adiya Nath Yogi just as the 2013 Muzafarrnagar carnage tarnished Akhilesh Yadav’s, who had to pay a heavy price for his failure to contain the communal riots. The death toll in Saharanpur may not come even close to what was witnessed in Muzafarrnagar but it has turned the heat on for the BJP government.
