NOIDA: A day after new UP chief minister   directed setting up of special “anti-Romeo” squads — aimed at checking harassment of women in public places — 22 such squads, including policewomen, fanned out in Noida. No one was arrested but several men were warned against loitering around schools, colleges, malls and the city’s commercial hub, Sector 18.

 A TOI reality check revealed a general perception that the drive against roadside Romeos is already turning out to be more like moral policing than a step against harassment alone. 
 
 The move followed directions from Dharmendra Singh, senior superintdent of police, Gautam Budh Nagar, for each police station in the district to have an anti-Romeo cell in place to check harassment and bring to book anyone indulging in it.
 
 Singh emphasised that the squads have been directed not to hound and harass any couples roaming the city or sitting in parks.
 
 Talking to TOI, several girls lauded the CM’s move and hoped it would be sustained, while many young men in the city were apprehensive. “Now even the shy girls will be able to move out of their homes,” said Neha, a BCom student studying in a city college.
 
 Another young woman was happy to see the special squads touring the areas of the city but was apprehensive. “I hope the police do not harass couples and only the men harassing girls are rounded up,” said Komal, who was enjoying an evening out with her friend in Sector 18.
 
 “We don’t want moral policing but want a safe environment to go wherever we want,” said Niharika, who was shopping with her friends in a city mall. Singh meanwhile agreed that there was always a threat of harassment to innocents when such a campaign was undertaken.
