NEW DELHI: The capital is likely to receive respite from the searing   forecast for Friday, which is expected to take the   down by a couple of degrees. 

 The maximum temperature was recorded at 39.4° Celsius on Thursday - two notches above normal for the season with Palam observation centre recording 40.9° Celsius.
 
 Officials from the regional met office, however, said that the rain is unlikely to keep temperatures under control for too long as a maximum temperature of 42°C is forecast for April 25.
 
 "There will be light rain and a drizzle in most parts of the capital on Friday due to an active western disturbance, which will take the maximum temperature down to 37-38 degrees Celsius. However, the temperature will start rising from Monday and it is expected to touch 42 degrees Celsius by Wednesday," said Kuldeep Srivastava, scientist at the regional met office.
 
 Thursday was the second warmest day of the season so far, with   recording a season high on Monday when it touched 40 degrees Celsius. 
 
 The maximum temperature on Thursday crossed the 40 degree mark across three locations in Delhi on Thursday with Palam recording the highest at 40.9°C. Ayanagar and Ridge recorded a maximum of 40.2 and 40.3 degrees Celsius, respectively.
 
 Delhi's humidity meanwhile oscillated between 13% and 62% in the last 24 hours. 
 
 Met officials have forecast a maximum of 40° Celsius on Friday with the minimum temperature likely to be around 23° Celsius. Delhi last recorded rain on April 11, which was again attributed to a western disturbance.
