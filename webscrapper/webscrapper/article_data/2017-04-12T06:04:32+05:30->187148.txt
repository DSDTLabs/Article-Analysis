PATNA: Former deputy CM   on Tuesday accused   chief Lalu Prasad’s family of “illegitimately” owning A K Infosystems Pvt Ltd, a shell company which owns lands worth several hundred crores in Patna.

 The   MLC last week alleged Lalu’s family has ownership stakes in a Rs 750-crore mall coming up in Patna’s Saguna Mor locality.
 
 The leader of opposition in the legislative council on Tuesday alleged businessman   Katyal and his son Amit Katyal set up a beer brewery firm at Bihta as Iceberg Insustries Pvt Ltd during the chief ministership of Lalu’s wife Rabri Devi (2000-2005). 
 
 The Katyals floated another firm, A K Infosystems Pvt Ltd, on September 28, 2006, in which Rabri, deputy CM Tejashwi, forests minister Tej Pratap and Lalu’s daughter   were appointed additional directors on June 19, 2014, according to Modi.
 
 Lalu’s daughter Ragini was also made an additional director in the firm on November 23, 2015, the BJP functionary said, adding Lalu-Rabri’s four siblings were later elevated as directors in the firm. 
 
 Modi said Tejashwi and Tej Pratap quit the firm a day after they won the the 2015 assembly election. However, he said, they had hidden this information from the Election Commission while filing their nomination papers.
 
 “As on date, A K Infosystems has Chanda and Ragini as directors while the company’s 100% shares are owned by Tejashwi and Rabri. The firm owns lands at prime locations in Patna,” Modi said and alleged the Katyals obviously gifted these lands to Lalu family in lieu of the help they got to set up their beer unit at Bihta.
 
 Modi last week alleged similar “fraudulent transfer” of ownership of Lara Projects LLP, which allegedly owns land worth of Rs 200 crore on which Meridian Constructions is developing a G+7 mall.
