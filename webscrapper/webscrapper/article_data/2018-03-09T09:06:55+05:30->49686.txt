NEW DELHI: The   ( ) went ahead with the announcement of the annual contract for Indian cricketers to make certain that Indian players are insured before the   and their injuries are duly covered if they miss out on the biggest T20 league.

 
 “This IPL insurance is done by the Indian cricket board ( ) to ensure players are compensated with their IPL salaries in case they get injured while playing for India. They also have a separate insurance as contracted players for India,” sources told TOI on Thursday.
 
 “The CoA couldn’t have waited longer than this. The contract list is important before the IPL. If one of the cricketers gets injured and his IPL team isn’t paying his salary, the BCCI would have to come in. Therefore, you can’t see them playing without a contract for a long time,” the source said.
 
 With the office-bearers of the BCCI not having a say in the players’ contract, there is resentment brewing among board members, who wanted a forum to discuss the matter before finalising the financial implications. The members are claiming that if CoA could have waited till the media rights formality is completed on March 27, BCCI would have been far more equipped to dole out more money for domestic cricketers.
 
 A case in point is  , who still hasn’t got his insurance money for his injury before last IPL. Since it’s a tripartite contract, both BCCI and his IPL team have been passing the buck for more than a year and he is still due to get his claims. Yadav hasn't written any official letter in this regard. It is learnt that Yuvraj Singh's pending insurance money for missing a few IPL games was recently cleared by CoA.
 
 Sources close to CoA refuted charges by saying the players’ draft contract to the board officials was sent in January.
