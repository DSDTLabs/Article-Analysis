HYDERABAD: Faced with faculty crunch, the   has decided to scrap 14 courses. Vice-chancellor   said that all the courses that are being discontinued for this year have single-digit faculty.

 
  
  
 
 “We have decided to discontinue 14 courses due to lack of faculty, while the serving staff is already overburdened. To offer courses like PhD (human rights) or M Phil (Dalit and Adivasi studies), there is no faculty at all,”   said. The varsity is crying away from offering M Phil ( ) as the two faculty members will attain superannuation this year.Seven courses are discontinued at PhD level, while four M Phil and three integrated masters courses will bite the dust. This will mean that only 276 Ph D seats will be up for grabs this year as against 322 in the academic year 2017-18.
 
 Asked about discontinuing the integrated MA ( ), the VC said response for the course in the last couple of years had been poor.
 
 Interestingly, the varsity authorities had said that a onetime chance is being given to old students to complete their PhD.
