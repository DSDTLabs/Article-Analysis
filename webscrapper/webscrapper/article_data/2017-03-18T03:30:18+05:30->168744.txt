NAVI MUMBAI: The   on Friday asked   to carry out a scientific survey in the next 8 days to find out if the city can meet the high court’s  . 

 There is a   stay saying that every flat needs a parking space. “This means that no development proposal of gaothans or   buildings can happen because this criteria cannot be fulfilled,” said corporator Kishor Patkar.
 
 Corporators have been calling the civic body’s demolition drive against extensions or constructions by PAPs living in rural parts of the city unethical. 
 
 The objections were raised during a motion for attention called on problems faced by the original inhabitants of the city due to the administration’s action.
 
 “The houses which   are now terming to be illegal and encroachments are actually need-based expansions made by the original inhabitants on whose land Cidco has developed the city. On one hand, when no permission is being given for development of buildings, on the other hand NMMC is undertaking demolition as well,” said Nerul corporator Suraj Patil.
