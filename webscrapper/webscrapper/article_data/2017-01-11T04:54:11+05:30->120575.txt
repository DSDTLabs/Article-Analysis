MUMBAI: The state’s total spending on education has remained unchanged at nearly 18% of the overall budget for the past four years and more than two-thirds of it is used up to pay teacher salaries, found a   by   (CRY) and  ,   (CBGA). The study also highlighted that Maharashtra spends only 0.4% of its   on teachers’ training.

 The study, which examined the composition of school budgets of 10 states — Maharashtra, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, MP, Odisha, Rajasthan, TN and UP—has found that in spite of spending being stagnant, Maharashtra spends more on education compared to other states.
 
 However, the spend of Rs 28,630 per student is less than the Rs 32,263 spent per student at a Kendriya Vidyalayas. “Even states like Kerala and Goa are spending a lot more than Maharashtra. The standards need to be met,” said Kumar Nilendu, general manager, West-CRY.
 
 Maharashtra spends 69% of its school education budget on teacher salaries. Share of inspection and monitoring is as low as 0.5% and for infrastructure it is 3.8%.
 
 The study also said that Maharashtra spends about 40% of its school education budget on private-aided and unaided schools though these constitute only 30% of the total elementary schools. The report also found that while Maharashtra has 24% of children from socio-economically weaker sections among the population in school-going age, the exclusive allocation on educational schemes for marginalized population is a mere 1.9%.
 
 “Maharashtra as a progressive state needs more state-run secondary and higher secondary schools, and much greater emphasis in reaching out to socio-economically marginalized children,” said Kreeanne Rabadi, Regional Director –West-CRY. “Further investment in recruitment, training and capacity building of teachers, and SMCs need to improve significantly.”
