Nagpur: Mother and the child are incomplete without each other. Therefore, Mother’s Day is also an important day for the child. I cannot convey the significance of a mother in just words because words cannot do justice to her or describe her real value,” said mayor Nanda Jichkar.  She was speaking at ‘Sangeet Sandhya’ programme jointly organized by Nagpur Municipal Corporation and Aai Foundation to thank all the mothers for their sacrifices and efforts at Dnyaneshwar Udyan, Dattatraya Nagar, on Sunday. Jichkar said that Aai Foundation has been an integral part of city’s development and it has always strived for the betterment of all. Programme coordinator Nagesh Sahare said that there were more than a million reasons to be thankful to our mothers. “Role of mothers in our life is irreplaceable. They guide and support us throughout our life. We cannot appreciate them enough,” he said.  Stressing the importance of mothers in our life, Snehal Chonde, one of the singers who performed at the event, said, “I am what I am because of my mother. She has been with me in all my highs and lows.”   Pranjal Walde, one from the audience, said, “I'm delighted to see that such programmes are being organized in our city. Mothers in every household have a very thankless role, it is important that we always remember that all of us would be helpless without them.” Snehal Vihare, Sandeep Jadhav, Preeti Rode, Ashok Jambhulkar and Nagesh Gedam, were present among others.
