NASHIK: During a reality   in   for waste segregation on Thursday, it was found that most of the vans did not have   for wet and  

 Also, those having compartments were nothing but a 3-4 feet wall that resulted in mixing of both dry and wet waste. According to the terms and conditions of the contract between   (NMC) and garbage collection contractors, waste segregation is of prime importance. If the contractor fails to abide by these, the NMC can take action.
 
 “I have not seen partitions in most of the vans and the ones that have it are so low that wet and dry waste mixes automatically. The partition should be from top to bottom,” said  , who has been working on creating awareness about waste segregation for more than five years.
 
 Radhika S, a computer professional, also agreed that there was no system for waste segregation in the vans. “The NMC is asking us to segregate waste at source or else they would impose fine. But do they have the provision for collecting segregated waste?” Radhika questioned.
 
 “If the terms and conditions of the contract are not followed then action should be taken and the contract can also be cancelled. I am taking rounds of the prabhags to check cleanliness,” said mayor Ranjana Bhansi.
