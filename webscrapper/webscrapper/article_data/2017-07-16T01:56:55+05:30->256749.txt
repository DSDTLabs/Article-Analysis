NEW DELHI: A day after DJB   alleged harassment of   by members of the Vidhan Sabha committee on public undertaking, employees have threatened to go on an indefinite   from Monday unless the committee tenders an “unconditional apology” and the chief minister ensures that they are not “victimised” further.

 The Delhi Engineer’s Association has claimed that members of other civic agencies might join the strike.
 
 Meanwhile, government sources said that no   would be tendered since there was nothing to apologise for. “This strike is being done to ensure that there is no fair enquiry. Water is an essential service and no strike will be tolerated,” said an official.
 
 On Friday,   employees claimed, the CEO was humiliated by members of the public undertaking committee after the rest of the officials had been asked to leave the meeting room. Meanwhile, the committee has forwarded a complaint against Chandra to the assembly’s privilege committee saying that he was rude and that he has failed to explain why there was a delay in release of funds for various infrastructure projects.
 
 The other allegation against Chandra was by the estimate committee, which has said that despite four reminders, he has failed to share documents pertaining to certain projects worth Rs 776 crore in which the committee has found serious discrepancies.
 
 The Delhi Engineer’s Association has said that AAP MLA Dinesh Mohania, who is the chairman of the estimates committee, and also a member of the board was “involved as a member of the board in clearing this scheme and award of this work”. The association has alleged that MLAs, as members of various committees, have been calling the CEO and senior members of DJB “and humiliating them by asking irrelevant questions and making false allegations”.
