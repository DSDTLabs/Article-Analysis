PUDUCHERRY: The cold war between lt governor   and the   government in   escalated on Friday with Bedi   relieving Puducherry municipality commissioner   of his duties and placing him on compulsory wait. 

 The order passed by chief secretary Manoj Parida was based on the directions of the Speaker of the legislative assembly V Vaithilingam.
 
 Declaring the order 'invalid' as it was 'not issued with approval of the competent authority', Bedi said Chandrasekaran shall continue to serve as commissioner. She directed Parida to send a compliance report to her.
 
 Parida in an order on Thursday relieved Chandrasekaran of his duties for 'infringing' on the rights of an AIADMK MLA besides insulting him after the elected member moved a privilege issue against the official. 
 
 Vaithilingam forwarded the issue to the privileges committee headed by the deputy speaker of the legislative assembly and directed the government to relieve the official of his duties until the committee resolved the issue. 
 
 Parida posted director (art & culture) S Ganessin to hold additional charge of the posts of commissioner. 
 
 Bedi who was on an official tour sent a letter to Vaithilingam on Friday on learning about the development. 
 
 "Only the Lt Governor can transfer or post personnel belonging to Puducherry civil services (PCS) as is clear from the rules," she said in the letter.
 
 She also sought him to treat her communication as a message to be read out in the assembly. 
 
 Vaithilingam, however, preferred to return Bedi's letter saying it was not signed by her, forcing Bedi to issue a note through her secretary G Theva Neethi Dhas in the afternoon, declaring that the relieving order issued was 'invalid'.
