NEW DELHI:   on Thursday told the Delhi high court that the latest   limiting number of students under a professor has been accepted by a majority of universities.

 In an affidavit, the university said if it has to receive central grants it is imperative that   too abides by the norms.
 
 Last year UGC came out with a notification specifying that a professor can’t have more than three M Phil and eight PhD scholars under his or her wing.
 
 A section of students had moved court challenging the notification. Justice V K Rao had on last date issued notice to the varsity and sought its reply.
 
 The students have argued that the May 5, 2016 notification of the   (UGC) “threatens to put their future in jeopardy” as they would not be able to find a supervisor.
 
 JNU students are protesting against the notification which is set to result in “excess seat cuts” leading to lack of admission in the MPhil, PhD programmes at several centres of the varsity. They have been on a sit-in protest since February 9 at the administrative block named “Freedom Square”.
 
 Appearing for JNU, advocate Monika Arora informed court on Thursday that the UGC regulations are “binding on the university”. Arora said 43 central universities were already abiding by the UGC’s notification.
 
 However, in a softening of stand, the students also told court they will limit their challenge to procedural lapses on behalf of JNU. They maintained the university failed to include the students’ in the meetings held to discuss the implementation of the notification.
 
 The court has posted the case for further hearing on March 14 after Arora said the students have not made UGC a party in the case.
