BATHINDA: Irked over Punjab government for not letting them go to Delhi and confining them to the grain market of   in   district, activists of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta Sidhupur) on Tuesday crossed the police cordon and left for the Capital to raise their demand for complete farm loan waiver and implementation of all recommendations of M S   committee.

 Policemen tried to stop them, but they did not listen to them and crossed the barricades. “Farmer activists had chosen the first day of the budget session of Punjab assembly for this, hoping that they may not be cane-charged as this may become a big issue in the house,” said BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) leader. Activists of BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) were going to Delhi on February 21 on a call by 62 farmer outfits from across the country for loan waiver when they were stopped near   town of   district. 
 
 After breaking the police cordon at Cheema, the farmer activists headed towards Khanouri to enter   for their onward journey to Delhi in tractor-trailers. “We wanted to raise our demand for loan waiver and implementation of Swaminathan panel’s recommendations but we were stopped midway and confined at Cheema. Today, we defied the police orders to head towards Delhi,” said BKU (Ekta Sidhupur) general secretary Resham Singh.
 
 Sangrur SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu said that, “The police had put up barricades to stop farmers but they crossed these and moved towards Khanouri. The police, however, restrained itself from using force to stop the situation from taking any ugly turn.”
