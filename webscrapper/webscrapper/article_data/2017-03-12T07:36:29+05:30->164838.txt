The actor continues to be a part of the television show Dil Se Dil Tak, putting to rest rumours of his replacement
 
  The last few days have seen websites report that actor   is being replaced on the television show Dil Se Dil Tak. But we have found out that there is no such thing happening, so Sidharth's fans need not worry.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  So where did these rumours originate from? Apparently,   and the production house had some differences and that gave fodder to his detractors, who went all out to tarnish his name. Says an actor from the show, "We were shocked to read the kind of negative things that were said about him on some websites. They were either incidents that had been blown out of proportion or were false. It really seems like somebody has an axe to grind against him."
  
  The actor adds, "Differences between actors and producers crop up all the time in our industry and they are resolved amicably. In this case too, both Sidharth Shukla and the producers Shashi and   are thorough professionals. It's sad that some others took advantage of the situation and spread rumours."
  Well for now it seems like all is well and   (Sidharth Shukla) will continue to impress viewers in Dil Se Dil Tak.
