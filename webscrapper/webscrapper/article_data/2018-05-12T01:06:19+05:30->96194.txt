NEW DELHI: Registration of properties in Delhi by sub-registrars needs a systemic overhaul to ensure people are not cheated, the Delhi high court has said.

 In an important ruling, the court has directed AAP government and Union ministry of urban development to “create a mechanism for registering transactions in respect of immovable property and to ensure that a proper search is done before a new transaction is registered.”
 
 Justice Pratibha Singh’s order came while hearing a case that revealed multiple sales of the same property and each time the transaction had been duly registered, leading to long-pending disputes.
 
 “The present case reveals a sordid story of how real estate transactions are carried out in a city like Delhi. Properties are sold multiple times illegally, leading to long-pending disputes. It highlights a serious flaw in registration of title documents in respect of immovable property in Delhi,” the bench noted, while issuing corrective directions.
 
 Faced with a CR Park property entangled in litigation as the property agency misused the power of attorney to sell it to several people,   was surprised that “there is no mechanism in which such a subsequent registration could have been avoided.”
 
 It said a “simple computerised check relating to the property” should have revealed that the registered agreement to sell in favour of the first buyer was already executed and registered.
 
 “The sale of immovable property is supposed to be entered into a database in the city of Delhi and whenever registration is being done for a property, the data ought to be available as to the last document registered for the same property. If there is a previously registered document for the same property, the subsequent registration ought not to be permitted unless a no-objection is obtained or a link is established. This would ensure that innocent citizens who purchase properties are not deprived of their hard-earned money,” the court noted.
