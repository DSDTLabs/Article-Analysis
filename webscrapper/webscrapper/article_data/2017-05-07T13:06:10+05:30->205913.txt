Effluents from the industry have polluted wells in the area too,” Prakash averred. 
 
 Veterinary officer Vishwaradhya T M, who visited the spot, collected blood sample of one of the cows from the farm. “The sample has been sent to the regional research laboratory of the Karnataka Veterinary, Animal and Fisheries Sciences University (KVAFSU) in Mangaluru,” Prakash said. 
 
 The veterinary officer collected blood sample of cow aged around 2 years. In his letter to the laboratory, he has mentioned that the cow has clinical signs and symptoms of anorexia, hurried breathing, nominal atony, off feed and recumbent downer symptoms.
