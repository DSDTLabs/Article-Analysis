New Delhi: Food and civil supplies minister   alleged on Tuesday that he has received an   issued by the food   about the   of   through  . This system had been put on hold by the AAP government earlier. 

 Hussain also claimed that the order stated that ration cards of all those people who haven’t taken rations for the last three months would be cancelled. The minister is planning to approach chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on the issue and ask him to take it up with LG Anil Baijal. 
 
 “First when we sent the file to the LG to put e-PoS on hold, it was returned. But when the fraud came to light, he concurred with the government and said an inquiry was needed,” Hussain said at a press conference. 
 
 The row over ration disbursal has been on since March. In between, food commissioner M K Meena was transferred out and Mohanjeet Singh appointed as his successor. 
 
 There are 2,254 fairprice shops in the capital from where food grains are distributed to card holders at subsidised rates. The AAP government had initiated the e-PoS system in pilot mode at 46 shops. Based on the system drawbacks, the government had revised the plan and started a fresh pilot in 98 shops last year. 
 
 After assessing the potential of the shift, the new system was rolled out across the city in January this year. However, in February the government was seen opposing the system alleging deficiencies and seeking its withdrawal and substitution with a new system of doorstep delivery. The proposal has been hanging fire ever since.
