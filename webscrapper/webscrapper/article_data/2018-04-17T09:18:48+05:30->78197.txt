ROHATK: The postmortem report of the 10-year-old girl, whose body was found stuffed in a bag near a canal in Rohtak, has ruled out sexual assault on the victim. The autopsy was conducted by a panel of three doctors of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak.

 The police had registered a murder case against unidentified persons after the mutilated body of the minor girl was recovered on the Sunday afternoon.
 
 Rohtak Sadar station house officer (SHO)   said the postmortem conducted on the minor mentioned that there was no visible injury mark on the body and the private parts of the victim. He said the viscera sample had also been sent to forensic lab at Madhuban, Karnal for further investigation and confirmation about sexual assault and body injuries.
 
 “Though the autopsy report says there was no sexual assault on the minor girl, it can be confirmed only after the forensic examination report, which may take less than a week,” said Maksood.
 
 The police said teams had been sent to the districts where the sub-branch of Munak canal flows to find out about the missing reports lodged in the police stations. “We are matching the details with whatever information is pouring in but the girl’s identity is yet to be ascertained,” the SHO said.
 
 The canal starts from   and then flows into Karnal, Panipat, Sonipat and Rohtak. Its sub-branches flow into Rohtak where the girl’s body was found near Titoli and   villages of the district.
