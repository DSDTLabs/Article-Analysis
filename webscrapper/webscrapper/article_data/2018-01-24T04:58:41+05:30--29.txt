MUMBAI:   chief and MP Asaduddin Owaisi’s meeting at Nagpada junction on Tuesday was halted briefly after a shoe was thrown at him. 

 The situation was brought under control immediately as police and MIM volunteers assuaged the crowd that started dispersing. A case was registered at Nagpada police station against unidentified persons. Launching an aggressive attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Owaisi declared that he was not afraid of death. He attacked the RSS and said that the organization wants to create ‘Muslim Mukt Bharat’. Calling upon parents, he said they must prepare Muslim youngsters to face challenges. 
 
 Attacking the triple talaq bill, he said the bill is unjust to women and if it becomes a law it will exploit women. He said Muslim men find it difficult to keep one wife and still they are taunted for having four wives. “People ask me how many wives I have. I tell them I have just one who stays at home,” he said. 
 
 “Will triple talaq stop after the law is brought in,” he asked. “There have been 8 rapes in 6 days in Haryana. Yet Modi has not spoken about it. Between 2005-2015 there were 88,467 dowry deaths in India, 22 women die daily due to dowry. A law is not the answer, he said.
 
 He suggested that the Modi government allocate Rs 2,000 crore for rehabilitation of women divorced under triple talaq. Calling Modi’s concern for women an eyewash, he said, “Why didn’t you (BJP) give even one ticket to a Muslim woman in the recent Gujarat state  ? Why are there just gour Muslim legislators of BJP across the country.”
