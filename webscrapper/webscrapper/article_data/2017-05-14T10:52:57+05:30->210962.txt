LUCKNOW: AKTU vice-chancellor Vinay Pathak on Saturday asked the director of Institute of Engineering and Technology Prof AS Vidyarthi to lodge an   against  , a   scholar who made a mockery of examinations by setting the question paper, appearing in the same as a student and then evaluating his own answer copies.

 A three-member committee will investigate the incident. The committee includes former HBTI (Kanpur) director Prof RP Singh, former KNIT (Sultanpur) director   and AKTU controller of examinations JP Pandey.
 
 The committee will look into whether any institute rule regarding recommendation of appointment of evaluator has been violated. The committee will also probe the role of any other authority and submit a report in a month.
 
 Ojhaâ€™s enrolment was cancelled and he has been debarred from the institute. 
 
 Vidyarthi said, deputy examination controller  , while uploading marks, became suspicious when the name of the evaluator, subject teacher and examinee was found to be the same.
 
 According to university rules, all students registered in PhD are required to pass pre-PhD courses approved by the Research Development Council of the university. The candidates are informed verbally and through a notice that they will not opt for a subject in pre-PhD in which they are involved in any type of teaching, tutorial, or practical work. Despite this, Ojha opted for the same subject.
