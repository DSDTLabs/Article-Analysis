KOLKATA:   on Monday replaced   as the head of   as the party rejigged its state organisation heading into the 2018 panchayat polls — a precursor to the 2019 Lok Sabha election. 

 Locket was being groomed by the party leadership for the last two-and-a-half years ever since she switched from Trinamool Congress in February 2015. She was also being repeatedly put in the forefront of the party’s agitations recently, leaving clear indications that the party had a bigger role for her in mind.
 
 State   president Dilip Ghosh said, “Chatterjee replaced Ganguly as the Mahila Morcha president. Ganguly, now an MP, has been identified by the party leadership to play a larger role nationwide in addition to her responsibilities in the Parliament. Chatterjee will now play a larger role in the state.” 
 
 In her first reaction, Chatterjee said: “I hope to measure up to the faith put in me by the party and my state president. It is a crucial time for the party in Bengal and I will try to put in my best effort as per the directions of the party.”
 
 Ganguly — who couldn’t be reached for comment — was finding it difficult to play a more active role in Bengal owing to her Parliament responsibilities. According to sources, her 10-day march from Kamduni to Kakdwip in February 2016 was the Mahila Morcha’s last public outreach timed to coincide with the party’s pre-poll plunge ahead of the 2016 assembly polls. 
 
  “All changes have been made keeping in mind the upcoming elections in the state and various other challenges that we will be facing in the days to come,” Ghosh told reporters.
 
 According to party insiders, the change was being contemplated for some time after state BJP Mahila Morcha secretary Juhi Chowdhury was arrested for alleged involvement in child trafficking. Ganguly had defended her. Ganguly, sources said, had been courting seemingly avoidable controversies at times to divert attention from the party line.
