NAGPUR: Social worker   has urged chief minister   and energy minister   to scrap the power franchisee tender floated by MSEDCL. The state discom wants to appoint franchisees for Akola, Malegaon, and   followed by three more cities.

 Coming down heavily on Nagpur franchisee SNDL and its parent company Essel Utilities, he stated in a letter that it had been ousted from Sagar and Ujjain on grounds of non-performance. In Nagpur, non-payment of MSEDCL dues is a persistent problem. Wadpalliwar also said that franchisee model had failed at Bhagalpur in Bihar too. He demanded that such companies should be blacklisted.
 
 Bawankule had appointed a fact-finding committee to investigate complaints of poor performance of SNDL. The committee had submitted a report to MSEDCL but beyond issuing a show-cause notice, the discom officials did not take any action. Wadpalliwar has flayed Bawankule for shielding the franchisee.
 
 He pointed out that Fadnavis himself had strongly opposed appointment of a franchisee in Nagpur. BJP MLAs of the city have repeatedly complained against poor performance of SNDL. A large number of citizens have also protested against the company.
 
 However, instead of putting its house in order, MSEDCL was handing over a critical service like power distribution to private parties, whose sole aim was profit.
