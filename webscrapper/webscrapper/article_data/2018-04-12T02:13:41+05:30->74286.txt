NOIDA: Residents of   on Wednesday complained that a footpath in the area had been encroached upon by unauthorised dhabas and people living in illegal hutments, leaving little space for pedestrians to walk. Open defecation adds to the already unhygienic condition of the sector where a   garbage   has remained unattended for over a year. Despite repeated complaints, authorities have not taken any action till now, the residents said.

 “The footpath between Sectors 20-21 is encroached upon by an unauthorised dhaba (food joint), some huts and their inhabitants who defecate in the open, making it difficult for pedestrians to use the footpath or cross the road. Besides, people living on the footpath spread waste around their surroundings, leading to slum like conditions. Additionally, a potter and his family have squatted in other parts of the footpath,” said  , a resident of Sector 20.
 
 Another resident,  , said seven to eight huts had come up on a green belt near Sector 20 intersection which leads to the power substation. “The junior engineer of   knows that people are living in huts on the green belt, but no action has been taken against them,” said Thakur.
 
 On March 9, Noida MLA Pankaj Singh had visited the sector along with Authority officials and directed them to fix the clogged drains of the sector. However, the work began a week before and residents said that the problem still persists.
