 The reptile cabins housing 141 animals have been provided with coolers. More than 20 foggers (devices that create a fog) have been placed within cages of small birds while chimpanzees, monkeys have been provided with air coolers. 
 
 Deer enclosures have been fitted with 25 sprinklers and ostrich got five rain gun sprinklers. Shade nets covering almost all enclosures have also been put up.
 
 Nocturnal creatures, like albino porcupine and owl, safe, have been kept in rooms with ambient temperature. Zoo authorities said heat was particularly unbearable for small birds and monkeys, their bodies were unable to control temperature and excessive heat could be fatal for them.
