MADURAI: May Day held no meaning for the workers in textile and garment industries in Madurai as well as other parts of   as they continued to work for over 14 hours a day for poor wages, said the general secretary of  , P Muthuraja.

 He was speaking at the launch of the awareness campaign on securing living wages and decent work for female garment workers in Tamil Nadu, organized by the Justice   foundation and Textile Workers Union, Madurai. He said that contradictory to the popular belief that spinning mills once thrived in Madurai and they had become a thing of the past, they still continued to flourish by employing lesser people but making the same gains.
 
 “While May Day is celebrated to mark the liberation of workers and the victory of the labour movement in reducing the working hours to a minimum of eight hours a day, today many of the spinning mills and garment factories make the workers toil for more than 14 hours, defeating the cause. They work for longer periods for lesser wages. If the big industries pay them very low wages the smaller factories pay them higher wages but do not give them employment guarantee,” he said.
 
 Senior journalist   said that the Indian Economic survey (2016-2017) had stated that unemployment had increased by five per cent. The government’s demonetisation move and introduction of GST had resulted in employment opportunities being affected, according to another survey, he said.
 
 Over 80 % of the labour population worked in the unorganized sector without any wage guarantee while only 7% were employed securely, he said. While the employment given in Tamil Nadu during 2015-16 was 61,752 it was just 20,778 last year. Unemployment affected women more than men.
