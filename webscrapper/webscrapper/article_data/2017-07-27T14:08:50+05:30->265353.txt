AMRITSAR: Following refusal by a school in Australia to admit a five-year-old Sikh boy, Sidak Singh, for wearing a ‘patka’, the Sikhs under the aegis of an NGO, United Sikhs, are preparing to launch a community-led campaign to defend their articles of faith Down Under.

 Talking to TOI on Wednesday, United Sikhs international legal director   said that Melton Christen School had allegedly discriminated against Sidhak by refusing to enrol him for wearing a ‘patka’. Kaur, who recently left for Australia from India to attend the hearing, stated that after learning that Sidak’s father Sagardeep Singh was fighting the case alone, they arranged for a law firm Herbert Smit Freehils and counsel Eliza Holt on pro bono basis for giving legal representation.
 
 She further stated that at the end of the ongoing hearing in the case, the Victorian Civil and   (VCAT) would decide if young Sidak was discriminated against by the school. She apprehended that the case of alleged discrimination might not end at VCAT since which ever party loses could further appeal in the supreme court of  .
 
 “Hence, we must launch a community-led campaign so that resources may be made available to defend Sikh articles of faith,” said Kaur. She further said that representatives of United Sikhs met the Victorian Sikh Gurdwaras Council and the   to discuss about the ‘Right To Turban’ campaign in Melbourne. “We will be hosting a conclave in Melbourne titled “Freedom and Peace - Is there a Conflict’,” said Kaur. She said that the issue of religious freedom would be one of the topics to be discussed at the conclave.
