NEW DELHI: Refuting the allegation that   aka   was brainwashed into converting to Islam as part of a 'love jihad' conspiracy,   (PFI) leader A S   has told the   that all conversions were not be due to indoctrination and said many renowned personalities like A R Rahman and legendary boxer Muhammad Ali had embraced Islam on their own. 

 Zainaba, who is one of the parties in the case, filed an affidavit and contended that the allegations against her were baseless as Hadiya had decided to embrace Islam on her own. She said she was not involved in any mediation for Hadiya's religious conversion.
 
 "Numerous world-renowned intellectuals and personalities from totally different walks of life have embraced Islam everywhere in the world and no person can say that they embraced Islam due to indoctrination, brainwashing, radicalisation and so on. Madhavikutty, who embraced Islam at the age of 65 and modified her identity as Kamala Surayya, A R Rahman and Muhammad Ali are some examples," Zainaba said in her affidavit.
 
 She alleged that some organizations were trying to put pressure on people who had embraced Islam to re-convert and urged the court to order a probe against them as this was against the constitutional principle which recognize freedom of religion as part of fundamental rights.
 
 Zainaba filed her response after the apex court issued notice to her on a plea of Hadiya's husband   who challenged the Kerala high court order annulling his marriage. Jahan told the SC that the HC order was bad in law as a court could not quash a marriage among consenting adults on the plea of a third party.
 
 Hadiya also told the SC that she had embraced Islam of her own free will and she wanted to continue to live as a Muslim. In her 26-page affidavit, Hadiya gave details of how she got influenced by the teachings of Islam and got converted. She said that Jahan and others had no role in her conversion. tnn
