The music of   by   reminds one of Himesh Reshammiya albums, which suffer from an overdose of the composer, who doubles up as singer rendering many of the tracks in his high-pitched style. 

 The musician is talented, no doubt, proves a few of his songs in the first album, but a repetition of his signature style of singing isn't impressive at all.
 Penne Penne, the first song is sung by composer Vishnu and the song reminds one of Penne from Zachariayude Garbhinikal. The tune is different, but the voice, the various octaves and most importantly the Penne part, take away the novelty value from this one. Harinarayanan's lyrics are decent, but you are distracted by the stretched vocals. Overall, it's an average composition.
 
 The composer turns singer again for the next song, Sumbharani, penned by Arshid Sridhar. Its lyrics are lacklustre and are not at all catchy. The semi-drunken style singing hardly helps the song.
 
 The next song Pranayamanithu sounds like a continuation of the previous track, both in essence and spirit. Sung by Vishnu again, alongside Sachin Raj and Joyesh Chakraborty, it has a different tempo and singing style, but that doesn't set it apart in terms of quality. Right at the beginning, the rendition makes you feel 'Oh please, not again.' Halfway through the song, it becomes bearable though, thanks to a faint Sufi feel.
 TV Kandikkana, sung by Anwar Sadath is a fun song about black and white TV, with some nice beats. 
 It does trigger nostalgia about how TV influenced characters around us and is a decent listen for this reason. Laila Laila, the final song by Salih Haneef has a very average tune, with some clich'd words like maula and alaha.
