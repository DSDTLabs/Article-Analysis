GURUGRAM: When asked why there were so many women in his cabinet, Canadian premier   replied, ‘Because it’s 2015!”

 Making sure that every work space reflects the ratio of women to men is, surely, a no-brainer. But it appears that inclusivity and diversity are unrealisable objectives, easier to talk about than to achieve. And not just in India.
 
 As frustrating as this lack of progress is, it shouldn’t hide the many positive things that are being done to meet this long-hoped-for aim. And ‘I Inspire’, five years old this year, is one of those that seeks to knock down the walls of exclusion. This annual inclusive leadership conference will be held on April 21, and has as its theme this year, ‘Inclusion inspires infinite potential’.
 
 ‘I Inspire’ brings together, under one roof, not just corporate leaders, industry experts, business professionals and entrepreneurs. This year, among those who will be attending is  , whose bravery and eloquence earlier this year earned her many plaudits, while also putting her in the line of fierce calumny. Gurmehar will be taking part in the ‘Nationalism: Inclusion or Illusion?’ debate.
 
 ‘I Inspire’ is an initiative of ‘Biz Divas’, a group of women whose endeavour it is to present a space “for the women of our region to come together and raise a common voice”, so that female leadership can be encouraged in all walks of life.
 
 The day-long conference will have 30 speakers, and will include interactive sessions. Among the speakers will be   (CEO, Barclays Shared Services), film director and screenwriter Sudhir Mishra, film and TV director Onir, and Vrinda Grover, lawyer and human and women’s rights activist.
 
 Meanwhile, a ‘fireside chat’ with Sanjay Modi, MD (India, Middle East and Southeast Asia), Monster, and Sameer Chadha, CEO of KPMG India, will look to stress on the importance of men standing with and for women.
