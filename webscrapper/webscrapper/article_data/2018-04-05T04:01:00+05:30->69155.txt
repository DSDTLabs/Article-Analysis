Ahmedabad: Parking has become more expensive at the Kalupur railway station. Earlier, the charge was Rs 20 irrespective of the number of hours of parking; now, Rs 35 will be charged every four hours. The Indian Railways has implemented a new parking system similar to the one at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International airport. 

 According to officials, those driving into the station to drop people will have to leave the parking area in 15 minutes; beyond that time limit, Rs 35 will be charged as parking fee.
 
 Officials said the new parking policy will pinch the pockets of commuters who earlier used to park their vehicles daily at the railway station and took trains to their destination. 
 
 A officer said under the new system, car owners will have to pay Rs 105 for 12 hours, as they would be charged Rs 35 every four hours.
 
 For the premium parking facility near the platform, the charge is Rs 100 every four hours. The officials said the high rate has been introduced to deter parking over long periods, because the parking area is already constricted. “We noticed that people who have businesses nearby were parking their vehicles at the station. The new policy will discourage that practice,” a senior officer said.
 
 The officials said that two-wheeler parking would cost Rs 15 for four hours, and commercial vehicles will attract a charge of Rs 50 for two hours. 
 
 Rickshaw drivers will have to pay Rs 10 for two hours; but they will also be given 15 minutes to pass through without charge. However, the senior officer said that the new parking policy will add to traffic problems outside the station as all rickshaws parked inside will be lined up outside. Even commercial vehicles will be parked outside an already congested zone.
