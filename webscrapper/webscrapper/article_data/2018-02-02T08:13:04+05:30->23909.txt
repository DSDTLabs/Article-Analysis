 Arun Jaitley during his budget speech on Thursday announced that modern train sets with state -of-the-art amenities and features were being designed at the Integral Coach Factory ( ) in Perambur, Chennai. The first such train-set would be commissioned in 2018-19.

 As reported by TOI a week ago, this will be a semihigh speed self-propelled train which will come without engines and cut down travel time by at least 20% compared to other trains. This is because of faster acceleration and deceleration, said ICF officials.
 
 The 16-coach fully airconditioned train is slated to hit the tracks by June 2018, said officials. The   it will be able to run at will be 160kmph.
 
 The new train with an aerodynamic nose for reduced drag and for improved aesthetics is likely to replace the elite Shatabdi trains now used for superfast inter-city travel, said ICF officials.
 
 The train sets (like EMUs) will have continuous window glasses for a contemporary modern look and automatic plug-typeâ€™ sliding doors which will open and close automatically at the stations. Zero discharge vacuum-based bio-toilet is the other highlight for this train.
