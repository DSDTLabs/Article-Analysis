 Sanjay Gupta’s 'Kaabil' marks the return of  , and music buffs have been eagerly waiting for the entire album to hit the stands. Rajesh, who is known for his melody, has come up with an album that’s both peppy and romantic. The album begins with 'Kaabil Hoon', a melodious and soothing number in the voice of Jubin Nautiyal and Palak Muchhal. The highlight of the song is the use of trumpets, which comes like a breath of fresh air. There’s also another version (sad) of the song. ' ' is the revamped track of Saara Zamaana from the 80s hit, 'Yaarana'. Payal Dev’s edgy voice lends this number a new-age twist, making it a hot favourite in clubs.
 
 The album also features 'Kisi Se Pyar Ho Jaye', a recreated version of 'Dil Kya Kare' (Julie) with additional lyrics. ' ', sung by Jubin, is melodious and gives you a very 90s feel. More than the music, it’s the lyrics that catch your attention. Shot inside an amusement park, Hrithik Roshan and Yami Gautam’s chemistry is a high point. Next in line is the ballad, 'Mon Amour', which means ‘My Love’ in English. Vishal Dadlani’s energy is infectious and his rendition brings life to the song. But its forgettable lyrics don’t help the case and despite Vishal’s best efforts, it fails to grow on you. This might not be Rajesh’s best, but most of the songs work in favour of the plotline. Go for it for ol’ time’s sake!
