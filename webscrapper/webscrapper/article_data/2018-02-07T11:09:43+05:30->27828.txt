AGARTALA: The ruling   on Tuesday crticized an opinion poll that predicted the end of Left rule in   and victory for the BJP-IPFT coalition by a narrow margin in the coming assembly polls. 

 Criticizing the opinion polls, CPM described it as 'a move to boost the morale of BJP workers.'.
 
 According to the opinion poll, the BJP- IPFT alliance is likely to win 31-37 seats out of the total 60 assembly constituencies in the state while the Left was given 23-29 seats. 
 
  and other parties have not been found to win even a single seat in the state.
 
 CPM state secretary Bijan Dhar said the opinion poll was carried out by taking only 30,000 samples of a total electorate of 25.79 lakh which accounts for only 1.2%. The result shows that the sampling was done conveniently by the study group to get the suitable result, he added. 
 
 "We don't think the opinion poll has reflected the voters' views properly. We are confident that the   will sweep the assembly election and Modi's retreat of 2019 will start from Tripura with the assembly poll results. We are not worried at all," said Dhar. 
 
 BJP president Biplab Kumar Deb said, "We believe in the people's mandate. The end of Left rule is confirmed this time as the voters have made up their mind to oust the Communists from Tripura."
