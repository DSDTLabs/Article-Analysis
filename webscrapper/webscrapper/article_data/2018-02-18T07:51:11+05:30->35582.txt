CHANDIGARH: With   (PACS) running into losses, the Punjab government is planning to transform them into cooperative rural hubs for better business and providing quality products. Punjab additional chief secretary (cooperation)   on Saturday asked his department to set up rural hubs in selected PACSs in a phased manner. He said the hubs should focus on providing agricultural services, like renting out farm implements, to meet the demands of local cultivators. 

 Reddy has asked the officers of his department to chalk out a plan in 15 days for setting up the rural hubs, so that they could be made functional by April. He said around 30% PACSs were in losses and others were making thin profits.
 
 During a workshop on Saturday, Reddy pointed out the need to prevent stubble burning by farmers. He said PACSs would provide latest agriculture implements to farmers on custom-hiring basis to prevent stubble burning. A cellphone app will soon be launched soon to facilitate farmers to take implements on rent, he said.   MLA Kuljit Singh Nagra, special secretary (cooperation)  , registrar of cooperative societies  , officials of cooperative bank and representatives of few PACS attended the workshop.
