  Guests got to try their hands at boxing too 
 Ajit, a west Delhi resident, who tried his hand at basketball, said, "It's a great idea. I must have played a sport after several years and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It brought back memories of going out and playing with friends as a kid." Vikram, a volunteer at the carnival, said, "People have great enthusiasm here, which is heartening to see. Most of them tried their hands at the various sports multiple times."

  The Minister of State (Independent Charge) Youth Affairs and Sports,  , also visited the carnival. Not only did he play various games but also administered the Khelo India oath to all gathered there. "The main objective of this Khelo India movement is to get everybody on the playing field and out in the sun. People have always been told that they should study first and then play. But this is the first time we are telling the kids to put playing as a priority. We want to have everyone's support, so that it becomes a nationwide mass movement," he said.
