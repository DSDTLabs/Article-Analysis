KOLKATA: A rampaging mob broke into the house of two local goons at   on Saturday, ransacked the rooms and set the furniture on fire, apparently to "teach them a lesson" for shooting at a youth who had rescued a biker from the duo's grasp. The residents are apparently fed up with the two's highhandedness as they go on unleashing terror, flaunting their alleged link with the ruling party. 

 However, before the situation could spiral out of control, the police swung into action and made an arrest within 12 hours, on Sunday. 
 
 Trouble started in the morning when a biker,  , stopped to check a snag in his motorcycle. The goons,   and Bappa, stopped near him and picked up a fight with him over stopping there. As one of them hit Ghosh, Biswanath Seal, who was having tea at a nearby stall, intervened, said a resident,  . By then, Shyamal and Bappa's aide, Shankar, with whom they ran an extortion racket, joined in the fight, said the police. 
 
 As the fight intensified, locals intervened and the three goons fled the spot. But around 9 pm, the three visited Seal's home, called him out and one of them shot at him. They attempted to shoot another round but alarmed by the gunshot, bystanders rushed to the spot and chased the trio away, the police said. Seal was taken to NRS Medical College and Hospital.
 
 Angry with their mindless violence, residents of the area went on the rampage and barged into Shyamal and Shankar's homes. They destroyed their belongings, dragged Shyamal's furniture out and set them on fire. Before the rampage could turn even worse, the police rounded up Shyamal. "We hope to arrest the entire gang," said South 24-Parganas SP  .
 
 Locals claimed Shyamal, Shankar and Bappa were also part of a syndicate that supplied building materials at a higher rate. They harassed girls and ran a gambling and liquor den, they said.
