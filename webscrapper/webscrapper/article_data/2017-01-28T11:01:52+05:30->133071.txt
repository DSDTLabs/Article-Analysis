PANAJI: Congress leader Sachin Pilot on Friday criticised defence minister  , stating that Parrikar’s performance in the defence ministry was under question. “I don’t think he has lived up to the stature of defence minister,” Pilot said. He added that the Modi-government had gone back on the Centre’s commitment to ex-servicemen on OROP.

 “I am sorry to say but as defence minister, his (Parrikar) performance has certainly been under question. I don’t think there has been any defence minister in the past who has been so disinterested in his job,” Pilot said. 
 
 On Thursday, Union minister   said that Parrikar was a gift from Goa to the nation. But, earlier in January, BJP leader   had hinted that Parrikar could be the next chief minister of Goa.
 
 “As far as being a gift to the government of India, I think Parrikar is more of a return gift, if we go by what Gadkari said,” Pilot quipped. tnn
