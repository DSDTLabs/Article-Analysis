CHANDIGARH: After at least three senior   MLAs openly expressed their displeasure with party leadership for being ignored during the recent  , stalemate continues as they are still awaiting a meeting with party president  .

 One of the senior MLAs said he would decide on his next political move, including the option of resigning from party positions, only after briefing the party high command. “Meanwhile, the state unit has not made any efforts to reach out to us. Even this talk about suitably accommodating those left out of the cabinet is only in the media,” he claimed.
 
 Irked over not getting cabinet berths, three senior Congress MLAs—Rakesh Pandey from Ludhiana (North), Randeep Singh Nabha (Amloh) and Amrik Singh Dhillon (Samrala)—had resigned from the recently-constituted committees of the Vidhan Sabha on Monday.
 
 Sources said the disgruntled Congress MLAs waited for the party to reach out to them after the swearing in of new ministers last month. 
 
 However, the party leader’s plans to appoint MLAs as legislative secretaries and heads of boards and corporations too failed to generate much enthusiasm.
 
 Apart from senior MLAs, a section of hopefuls among the Dalit leaders too have been annoyed with the party after the cabinet expansion.
