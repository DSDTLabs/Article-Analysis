BHOPAL: A day after veterinary surgeons confirmed that a   rescued from Betul village was shot at with a firearm, state forest department handed over the case to its Special Task Force (STF)-wildlife for further investigations. 

 The pellet recovered from the tiger’s spine was handed over to the STF by   officials. STF chief R P Singh said investigations began into the case and retired forensic expert Dr D K Satpathy has been contacted for his opinion. Dr Satpathy performed autopsies on scores of bodies, all related to the gas leak of 1984. To his credit, he has several papers on ballistic investigations.
 
 A paralysed tiger was rescued from a village in Betul district on Saturday and shifted to Van Vihar National Park in   to monitor its condition and nurse it back to a healthy stage.
 
 The tiger was spotted by residents in Betul’s Rathipur village – 8 km from the district headquarters around 7 am on Friday. A team of experts from Satpura Tiger Reserve (STR) tranquilised the tiger after a 3-hour operation.
 
 “The tiger consumed 2 kg meat and drank plenty of water today. It’s in a stable condition and we are trying our best,” says Samita Rajora, park director.
 
 Conservations experts are worried about the growing poaching instances. “It looks like a slug from a muzzle of a loading gun. I think the perpetrators in this case wanted to kill something for pot. Say a sambar or a wild pig. If they were after a tiger, they would have chased the animal after it was hit. People going into the forest with guns so close to the district headquarters is a serious matter,” said Vibhav Chaturvedi, a conservation professional.
