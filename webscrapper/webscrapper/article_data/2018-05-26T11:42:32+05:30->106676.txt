CHANDIGARH: Three days ahead of the   assembly byelection on May 28, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) filed a complaint with the   on Friday, alleging that   had been removed from the constituency and should be redeployed. The allegations came on a day the Election Commission issued guidelines to   district election officer on Friday to ensure prohibition

 for 48 hours, beginning 5 pm on Saturday, to the end of the bypoll. Punjab chief electoral officer S   said guidelines had been issued in accordance with provisions under the Representation of Peoples Act. The ongoing campaign for Shahkot bypoll would end 48 hours prior to the polling date, he said. Subsequently, all political leaders, party functionaries or workers, who are not registered voters, will have to vacate the constituency, he said.
 
 Meanwhile, AAP spokesperson   said his party had pointed out to the Election Commission that security had been removed from the constituency. “We demanded that it should be immediately restored. There should be thorough checks at all places to prevent any kind of malpractice, so that people of 
  can exercise their franchise without inducement,” he said.
 
 The AAP leader said officials responsible for such security lapse should be identified and action taken against them. “Without proper security arrangements, any voting that will place will only be a sham and mere formality,” he added. The electoral officer, meanwhile, added that necessary guidelines had been issued to the police and civil administration of Jalandhar to ensure that outsiders, who were not required, leave immediately.
 
 The commission also directed election and police administration to keep a check on community centres, guest houses and lodges, so that outsiders, if any, can be kept housed without causing any disturbance during the electoral process, the officer said.
