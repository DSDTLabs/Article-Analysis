Mumbai: The   has decided not to conduct the third round of competency tests for this academic year and instead asked   to do it on their own. The tests, which are used to evaluate   for students of class I to VIII have been marred by controversies like   and criticism for high costs.

 In a circular issued on Monday, the Maharashtra Academic Authority (MAA) said the summative assessment II—third of the series of tests—will not be conducted this year. Schools have been told to conduct the tests. The baseline tests and summative assessment I for the academic year were held in September and November 2017.
 
 Competency tests are conducted thrice a year to gauge students’ learning levels in first language and mathematics. The test results are collated by the state government and schools, across boards, are graded on the student performance. However, in the previous years, the papers were out on social media days before the exam. Teachers had also criticized the state for spending huge sums on conducting the tests.
 
 Teachers feel the tests are unlikely to return next year. “We have raised a lot of questions on the amount spent on these tests. Not all schools conducted the tests and there were a lot of malpractices. Due to all this, the tests were not giving a real picture of the learning levels in the state and not achieving the objective. If schools are asked to do it, why would they make the effort?” said Uday Nare, teacher, Hansraj Morarji Public School, Andheri.
 
 State officials said they have asked schools to conduct the test only for this time. “We have not discontinued the tests. We have a lot of data for this year and schools too need to be able to check learning levels on their own. They are expected to check through these tests if students have understood the concepts well. Decisions regarding the tests for the next year will be taken soon,” said Sunil Magar, director, MAA.
