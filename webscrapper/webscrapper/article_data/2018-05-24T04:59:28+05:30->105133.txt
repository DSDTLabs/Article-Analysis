BENGALURU: As   took oath as the 24th chief minister of the state, the proudest in the crowd were his father H D   and son Nikhil.

 
 While Deve Gowda renewed his old alliances by taking care and ensuring that none of the VVIPs felt left out on the dais, Nikhil forged future alliances by sticking to the younger generation of leaders like SP president   and RJD leader  . The spring in the 85-year-old former PM’s step was clearly discernible as he asked his assistants to step aside as he walked briskly from one end of the stage to another, greeting all the dignitaries. 
 
 Having taken all precautions and measures to make the guests feel at home, Gowda took to the crowd and waved at them to loud cheers. He later sat beside his allies,   leader Sonia and Rahul Gandhi in the centre of the dais.
 
 Nikhil sure made his presence was felt on the grand political stage. Despite his politically active cousin, and Revanna’s son Prajwal Revanna being the first to arrive along with his grandfather, Nikhil was seen projecting himself as the son of the CM.
 
 Prajwal and his father H D Revanna stuck to the sidelines. While Revanna kept company with JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav and Congress senior leader Jaipal Reddy, Prajwal hung around behind the scenes.
 
 Meanwhile, in a green sari, Kumaraswamy’s wife Anitha Kumaraswamy also went around greeting all senior political leaders and even spoke a few words with BSP chief Mayawati and Sonia Gandhi. Anitha even waved at the crowds, making her presence felt.
