SAHARSA: In a bid to address security concerns, a group of youths in   in   has devised a self-financed security system using  . 

 They have started using the surveillance system around the mukhiya’s bungalow in their village. With the growing popularity of the system, neighbouring tolas of the panchayats are also making preparations for what they call “our indigenous security system”. 
 
 Brahmanand Jha, a social activist in the village, spearheaded the idea of installing the surveillance system. “I gathered 30-35 boys and discussed the pros and cons of installing the   cameras in a limited range of our tola. Within a fortnight, we purchased sixteen cameras and a master computer to monitor them,” Jha said.
 
 With a meagre investment of Rs 60,000 for purchasing the cameras and a recurring expenditure of Rs 5,000 per month, the entire set-up was commissioned in a month. “Now, we are enjoying a peaceful sleep at night. Not a single incident of crime has been reported since the installation of cameras,” Jha said.
 
 Locals said lumpen elements quite often used to create nuisance on roads, but police were unable to take action as the witnesses would often turn hostile. “Such issues don’t bother us any longer,” said Jha.
