BENGALURU: Commuters are paying a heavy price for   work from Byappanahalli to  : Stranded on jampacked roads, they inhale dust from construction activities along the stretch.

 
 Members of Whitefield Rising, a citizens’ group, said despite several complaints, the   (BMRCL) is yet to take any step to clear the debris or dust. The group recently filed a complaint with the   (KSPCB), claiming residents are suffering from several ailments, including respiratory disorders.
 
 KSPCB chairman Lakshman said he will raise the issue at a meeting with the additional chief secretary, environment department, on June 7. In November 2017, the KSPCB had directed BMRCL to use mechanised cleaning machines to dispose of the debris in a designated area.
 
 The stretch from Kadugodi police station to Prestige Shantiniketan via Hope Farm Road is filled with dust, said Anjali Saini, a member of Whitefield Rising, adding that BMRCL hasn’t expanded the road as promised earlier. “Now, the dust is 1.5-2ft thick on both sides of the road. Traffic jams have worsened the situation. BMRCL said they will sprinkle water to control the dust, but we insisted on clearing the stretch. Though things went well initially, dust hasn’t been removed for the past few months,” Saini said.
 
 “Following our ‘Give me   to breathe’ campaign, the KSPCB had asked BMRCL to opt for mechanised cleaning along the Metro construction areas in Whitefield. However, there has been no action on BMRCL’s part despite meeting its managing director Mahendra Jain,” said another Whitefield Rising member. Jain was not available for comment.
