AHMEDABAD/ VADODARA: The row over ‘Padmaavat’ is getting worse with goons taking the law into their hands. A Rajkot man, who expresss his opinion online in favour of the the movie’s release in   and a Vadodara man planning a trip to Mumbai to watch the film were assaulted in separate incidents.

 The Rajkot man, identified as  , was allegedly beaten up by unidentified men on January 21 after he argued in a   comment in favour of Gujarat not banning the film. 
 
 “I had merely posted a comment on Facebook saying that the film should be released and that people should not oppose it without even watching it,” he said. 
 
 “Soon after I posted this comment, many members of the Rajput community started hurling abuses at me on social media. The same evening (on January 21) 7-8 members of the community — all furious — rushed into my house to beat me up but when they saw my fractured hand, they slapped me 2-3 times and made me apologize,” Soni told TOI. The video of Soni apologizing to the attackers is doing the rounds on social media.
 
 Soni added that he had made a statement before police but refused police protection as he believes the controversy is over now.
