CHANDIGARH:   (PU) senate in its meeting on Sunday suspended an assistant professor of public administration held guilty of sexually harassing two students by Panjab University Committee Against Sexual Harassment (PUCASH).The issue was tabled in the meeting to decide the penalty against the professor on the recommendations of PUCASH.

  A probe in another case of sexual harassment is under way against the professor. After an hour-long discussion, members decided that a show cause notice should be sent to the faculty member asking why he should not be removed from the service. PU vicechancellor Dr Arun Kumar Grover said when the first case of sexual harassment came to light in 2014, he asked the professor to shift to the USOL department but he refused. 
 
 He said enough chances were given to him and the senate should take a decision on his service. Dr  , dean university instructions, suggested such sensitive issues should be resolved at the earliest so that students find the campus safe.
