 will soon be seen sharing screen space with his uncle  , for the first time in ‘Mubarakan’. The romantic-comedy directed by Anees Bazmee will see the Bollywood star play a double role of Karanveer Singh and Charanveer Singh, in the film that is set to hit screens in July this year. According to reports that surfaced online, the team worked around their shooting schedule in order to give Arjun a day off on Friday, March 25, which happened to be his late mother Mona Kapoor’s death anniversary. Reports state that the film’s producers called off the shoot in order to give their leading man time and space to spend the day with his sister Anshula. 

 Arjun reportedly arrived on the sets as usual, only to be later told that the team would not be shooting on the day, as a mark of respect. This thoughtful act reportedly brought the actor to tears. 
 
 ‘Mubarakan’ also stars Ileana D’Cruz, Athiya Shetty and Neha Sharma.
