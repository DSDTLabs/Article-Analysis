NEW DELHI: Continuing his tryst with religious imagery,   president   narrated his interactions with two temple priests to explain that his party believed in broad-minded, all-encompassing religion while that of rival   was more transactional.

 Speaking at the   plenary session,   said much was made of his visits to temples during the Gujarat elections, adding he had been doing it for years and also went to churches, gurdwaras and mosques. He said he learned from these experiences, launching into a tale of his visits to two temples.
 
 In a Shiva temple, when the priest, a Kashmiri, completed the prayer rituals, Rahul said he asked the priest what he had done? The priest responded that if he was looking for god, he would find him wherever he looked — in a temple, mosque, church, gurdwara, in trees and in the vastness of the sky. In another Shiva temple, Rahul said when the prayer was over, he repeated the question to the priest. 
 
 The latter responded that he had offered prayers and “you will become the PM”. “He then pointed to the ceiling and asked what I saw. I said cement. The priest said when you become PM, gold plate that ceiling... we are the soldiers of truth like the first priest,” Rahul said.
