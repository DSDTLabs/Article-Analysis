CHANDIGARH: The  's ongoing drive to shut   in the state has apparently set the alarm bells ringing in the offices of the   operating under the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA).

 According to   dated March 31, the Union ministry has even observed that "there is dissatisfaction among sections of Muslim community" in the country over government's recent drives.
 
 The alert categorically cites two reasons for this dissatisfaction: Alleged attempt to interfere in the Sharia law, and second, ban on illegal abattoirs and meat shops in Uttar Pradesh.
 
 It warns at least 12 different state agencies of Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir on the possible fallout of these moves for Ram Navami on April 4 and Hanuman Jayanti on April 11. "During these festivals, Hindus would perform rituals in temples, organise shobha yatras etc. At some places, prabhat pheris with tableaux depicting scenes from Ramayan would be organized," says the alert.
 
 The alert though does not specify any disputed religious site like Ayodhya but mentions that there will be attempts to flare-up incidents around these areas. "In the past, these festivals had witnessed communal incidents in various parts of the country over issues like display of religious flags and banners at disputed places, attempts to organize processions through non-traditional routines, stone pelting," it adds.
 
 The alert even warns of eve-teasing incidents by the anti-social elements as the fallout of the government's recent moves. "Constant monitoring of processions and congregations at temples and river ghats, check on movement of anti-social elements in communally sensitive areas is required," it adds.
 
 The alert also points out that areas having "mixed population of Hindu-Muslim" require similar vigil during both the festivals, Ram Navami and Hanuman Jayanti.
