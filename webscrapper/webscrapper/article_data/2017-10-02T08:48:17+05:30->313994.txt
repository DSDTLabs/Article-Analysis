JALPAIGURI: Nagar Berubari Bazar Babsayee  , a Durga Puja committee some 12km off  , and the local   organizers transcended barriers on Ekadashi to set a shining example of harmony.

 For the last 60 years, the Samiti has been organising Durga Puja on the market grounds and the Dashami immersion is preceded by a fair. It being a Saturday this year, the organisers wanted to immerse the idol on Sunday. But police denied them permission as it clashed with the Muharram route. It was allowed only after the   wrote to the administration saying they will delay their plans till Monday to accommodate the immersion request.
 
 The district police top brass — including SP Amitabha Maiti — is expected to be present at Monday’s Muharram procession.
 
 Nur Islam, secretary, Muharram Committee, however, came forward. “We didn’t want to break such an old custom. We too participate in the Durga Puja festivities. So we decided to delay the Muharram procession for a day to avoid confusion. It will held on Monday instead. The police top brass will be present in it,” he said. The SP said, “This is a very good gesture. Once the committee wrote to us of its intent we had no problem to grant permission. It is a very laudable gesture.” The immersion was completed on Sunday evening.
