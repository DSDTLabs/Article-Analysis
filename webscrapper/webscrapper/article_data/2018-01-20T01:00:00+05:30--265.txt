The youngster, who always wanted to be an actor, says he knows he doesn’t fall into the category of a typical chocolatey hero. "I know that I don’t have that typical hero-type waale looks. I fall into the category of someone like a   and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. But   has changed quite a lot now and even people with looks like that of mine can play a lead in a film. So, I am quite sure of my future in Bollywood and I know I will always get work because at the end of the day my acting skills matter," he says.
 Studying in class XI,   says he has been managing studies and work quite well. "I have been acting since I was seven years old. In fact, my parents, my school teachers and principal have been quite supportive of me to let me act and help me with my studies. So I have never had any problem juggling between studies and acting. Next year I will be appearing for my boards exams that's why I am trying to do as much work as I can this year," says Naman, who is also doing a Hollywood film 'The Extraordinary Journey Of A Fakir' with actor Dhanush.
 Ask Naman what does he do with the money that he earns at this young age and he says, "I have no knowledge about my finances as that is taken care of by my parents. Till date, I have no idea about how much I have been paid for any serial or movie. I am a gadget freak, so I keep on demanding latest gadgets from my parents, which they happily get for me."
