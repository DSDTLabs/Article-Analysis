NEW DELHI: The I-T department on Saturday exempted   from   on their investments in startups with effect from April 11.

 
 The tax concessions are subject to certain conditions laid down by the department of industrial policy and promotion last month, which said that the share capital and share premium of the startup should not exceed Rs 10 crore after such investments.
 
 Also, the angel investor who plans to subscribe to the shares in the startup will have to fulfil prescribed criteria and the startup will have to procure a report from a merchant banker, specifying the fair market value of the shares in accordance with income tax rules.
 
 The I-T department had on May 24 issued a notification, which superseded the one   had issued in June 2016.
 
 The commerce and industry ministry had on April 11 said that a startup can seek tax concession under the section 56 of I-T Act.
