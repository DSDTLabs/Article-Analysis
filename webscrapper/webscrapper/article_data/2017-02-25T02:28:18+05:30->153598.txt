The state government has formed a steering committee to probe the cause of death of children in tribal residential schools (ashramshalas) and recommend measures to prevent them. 

 Over the past decade, 1,077 children have died in the 19 state-run ashramshalas—a majority of the cases were reported from Taloda in Nandurbar, Dharani in Amravati, Kalvan in   and Dahanu in  . The 11-member committee, headed by former director general of health services in Maharashtra Subhash Salunke, will include representatives of NGOs, tribal development department, university departments, among others. 
 
 Activist Ravi Talpe had filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court regarding   of children in ashramshalas and the need to take immediate action. The committee was formed on January 25 following court directives issued to the state government.
 
 Deputy secretary   of the state tribal development department said, “The committee’s objective will be to analyze deaths in ashramshalas and suggest prevention measures. The committee will also analyze various training sessions organized for teachers and students in tribal schools and monitor the implementation of the recommendations in every district.” 
 
 The committees’ recommendations would have to be implemented by all district heads in schools under their supervision. The notification said the the tribal department should issue directives about implementing the recommendations.
