BENGALURU: In a shocking move, the   (AITA) has asked tennis legend Leander Paes to take a call on his retirement after the   tie against New Zealand in Pune next month. 

  "We haven't made any formal request to Paes. But as a player he has to take a call based on reality. And the reality is that Leander's ranking (No. 63) has dropped. Rohan Bopanna (28), Divij Sharan (58) and Purav Raja (62) are ahead of him," AITA secretary-general Hiranmoy Chatterjee said. 
 
 "Considering the current scenario, it is going to be tough for the selection committee to pick him for the next tie. It wouldn't be fair on the other players who are ranked higher than him," he added.
 
  Chatterjee said: "I spoke to Paes informally on retirement. He is fully aware of the situation. But we will give him an opportunity to take a call."
