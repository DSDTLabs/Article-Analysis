VADODARA: The opposition   staged demonstrations in the general board meeting of the   ( ) on Friday evening. The elected representatives of the party are demanding compensation for those whose houses were razed in the series of razing drives by the civic body in the recent past.

 The opposition demanded that the VMC should compensate the residents in areas, where roads were widened much like it had done in the case of Fatehpura. In the past, VMC has stated that it would compensate those who lost their properties by giving them transferable floor-space index (FSI) or monetarily.
 
 But off late, the civic body has held that it would only give transferable FSI. VMC opposition leader Chandrakant Shivastava said that hundreds of houses and shops were razed either completely or partially during razing drives. “The civic body has not clarified on what it plans to do for the compensation of their owners,” he said. 
 
 The ruling   members countered the Congress by stating that the issue should be discussed instead of holding demonstrations. Some ruling party members even called the Congress demonstrations directed towards the ensuing assembly polls.
