Gurgaon: Several key decisions to ease the flow of traffic at and near   and   flyover were taken in a meeting between representatives of the Manesar Industries Welfare Association (MIWA),  , MCEPL, Skylark and traffic police on Thursday. 

 The decisions included deploying traffic marshals 50-100 metres ahead of the FASTag lanes to guide travellers, construction of a cloverleaf near the Kherki Daula toll in 12 months and a U-turn at the Hero Honda Chowk flyover for trucks. TOI takes a look at how these will help travellers.
 
 U-turn at HH Chowk flyover
 
 Trucks that find it difficult to take a U-turn at Hero Honda Chowk tend to move towards Sector 10 and choke the entire stretch. “Within 10 days, the NHAI will open a cut ahead of Hero Honda Chowk flyover for trucks to take a U-turn both from the Jaipur-Delhi and Delhi-Jaipur side. A road will be built so that trucks with a considerable height can pass ,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice-president, MIWA.
 
 Traffic marshals before toll
 
 At the Kherki Daula toll plaza, there are three dedicated lanes for fast-tag users. Chaos, however, prevails at the toll plaza when travellers who do not have fast tags enter the dedicated lanes. “To ensure commuters know where the FASTag lane starts, marshals will be deployed 50-100m ahead. The same lanes can be used by emergency vehicles,” Gaind said. 
 
 S Raghuraman, CEO of expressway concessionaire MCEPL said the fast-tag lanes would also be marked properly.
 
 Cloverleaf at Kherki Daula
 
 The NHAI has planned a cloverleaf on the Gurgaon-Jaipur highway to ease traffic snarls near the toll plaza. The cloverleaf, which is expected to come up in a year, will connect to the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), Central Peripheral Road (CPR) and the expressway.
