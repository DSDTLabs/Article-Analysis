MUMBAI:   has made adverse remarks on the functioning of the   (FDA).

 CAG’s report revealed that FDA has inspected only 45,758   (62%), out of around 73,000 in the state. “The FDA had failed to take action against 1,535 drugstores whose licences had expired, thereby posing a risk to public health by the possible sale of medicines,” said the report. The report mentioned that the state’s premier agency for consumer protection has several vacant positions, which are having a direct bearing on its performance.
 
 While the agency needs over 200 assistant commissioners across the state, the actual strength is only 41. The state requires over 1,008 food safety officers, but only 108 have been deployed. 
 
 There are 4,800 and 5,280 drugstores in Mumbai and Thane that have not been inspected at all. 
 
 The report also disclosed that the FDA’s sampling process was faulty. The report mentioned that there was a delay in recalling ‘not of standard quality’ (NSQ) drugs resulted in consumption of the same by the public. In 95 of the total 375 cases that were scrutinized, 50% of the NSQ drugs were already consumed before being called back. The sampling process also showed serious deficiencies. Samples of food, instant milk substitutes were not taken for testing. The report also talks about the lack of testing facilities like the absence of a microbiological division to check pathogenic, yeast, mould in foodstuff. A total of 26,437 samples were tested in three labs in the state in the last 5 years, 40% or 10,501 samples were tested after 90 days of the sample being drawn.
 
 Under the  , 2011, the state-level steering committee met only twice during 2012 and 2017.
