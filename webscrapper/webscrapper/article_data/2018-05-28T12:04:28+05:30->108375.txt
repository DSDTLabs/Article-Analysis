PUNE: Six new sewage   (STPs) are being set up to treat the sewage being generated in the city. The new plants will increase the treatment capacity by 250 MLD per day. 

 The tendering process for the plants will cost around Rs 450 crore.
 
 These STPs will be a part of the pollution abatement plan of the Mula and Mutha rivers. The Union government has signed a loan agreement with   ( ).
 
 The project report states the aim is to improve water quality in the Mula and Mutha rivers by augmenting sewage collection systems and better treatment facilities. The rivers receive much of the untreated waste generated by the city every year.
 
 “Pre-qualification of the companies will be done. JICA has given its consent. The firms will be able to participate in the tendering and carry out construction of STPs,” V  , head of PMC’s water supply department, said. 
 
 Kulkarni added that the plants will be up and running in two and a half years. “The new plants will increase the treatment capacity significantly. Almost all the sewage that’s being generated in the city can be treated with this capacity augmentation,” he said.
 
 Insufficient waste water treatment capacity, non-functioning of intermediate pumping stations and non-availability of sewerage system have led to untreated waste flowing into the Mula and Mutha rivers. 
 
 Currently, about 744 MLD of sewage is being generated in the 10 STPs with a treatment capacity of 567 MLD. One of these plants, with a capacity to treat 90 MLD, has not been functioning. 
 
 The six new plants are part of a batch of 11 facilities that are being set up to deal with the city’s growing sewage problem. According to officials, the 11 plants will be able to handle waste generation until 2027. 
 
 The new plants will also be equipped with superior waste-treatment technology, including a system that will remove nitrogen and phosphorus from the water.
