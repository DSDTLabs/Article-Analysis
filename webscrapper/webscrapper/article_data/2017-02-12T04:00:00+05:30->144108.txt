Ahmedabad: It was February 1987 and the Indian Army was fiercely fighting Pakistani soldiers at the world’s highest battlefield — the Siachen glacier — and trying to retain its hold. A young Captain went to a forward post as Pakistanis started heavy shelling. The Captain’s 62nd Field Regiment retaliated appropriately. 

 On February 12, a shell hit a mountain right behind the position of the armymen and soon created an avalanche that killed the Captain and his fellow jawans.
 
 The Captain was a 25-year-old youth from Ahmedabad, Nilesh Soni. Sunday would mark 30 years of the fateful incident which would be commemorated by his family members, Indian Army representatives in Ahmedabad and citizens. The event will take place at 10:30 am at the Soni monument near Anjali Crossroads.
 
 Jagdish Soni, his elder brother, said that Nilesh is still alive in their hearts. “Our aim is to motivate youth to serve the nation and remember martyrs. While Siachen has remained the most difficult front even today with modern gears, one can only imagine how our jawans must have fought 30 years ago,” he said.
