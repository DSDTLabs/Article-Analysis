BEIJING: Alexander 'Sasha' Zverev is not the boy next door. More, a fashion magazine cover. His 6 ft 6' frame, is a mix of athletic and super model. He stands like a tower, a new dawn, a reminder of his position in men's tennis. His streaked crown falls across his forehead in trendily styled waves. He could rule the ramp, but the chalked rectangle is what he has set his sights on.

 At 20, ranked four in the world, and seeded two in this week's China Open, the Ger man calls himself 'work in progress'.
 
 "In 2015 I finished inside the top 100 for the first time," Zverev said of 24-months ago when he played the qualifiers in the Chinese capital. "Last year I was almost top 20. I was top 20 during the year, but I didn't finish top 20. I was No. 24, now I'm No. 4. I don't want to stop here. I want to keep going, keep improving."
 
 Zverev, who has enjoyed a breakthrough in the rankings, courtesy two Masters 1000 titles, is playing his first competitive match since the US Open.
 
 Zverev, who has a difficult opener against Briton Kyle Edmunds, said, he has learnt to deal with pressure.
 
 In other first round results, Spain's   put out Croat Borna Coric 6-3, 6-4; Belgium's   put out Canada's   5-7, 7-6, 6-4.
