BENGALURU: A daily-wage worker and mother of a six-year-old girl has been arrested for allegedly murdering her alcoholic husband and trying to pass it off as an accidental death.

 R  , 22, and Raju alias  , 26, from   in Ballari district, lived with their daughter in a rented house at JP Nagar III Phase. Raju would regularly consume alcohol and beat his wife as she objected to it, police said. 
 
 On Monday evening, Raju is said to have consumed alcohol. “Maheshwari took him to task and Raju assaulted her. Their daughter tried to stop, but Raju beat her also. This irked Maheshwari, who took a rod and thrashed Raju till he died,” police said.
 
 Maheshwari went to her landlord’s house in the same locality and told him that Raju had died in a road accident. She told him that while they were walking on the road, a vehicle rammed Raju. She brought him home, but he died, he had claimed. 
 
 The owner called police and Maheshwari repeated the same. But she spilled the beans when police asked her to take them to the accident spot. 
 
 Police said in January, Maheshwari took Raju to a traditional healer in Ballari to get him out of alcohol addiction. “After spending nearly two months, the couple returned to the city in the second week of March, but Raju continued with his habit,” they added.
