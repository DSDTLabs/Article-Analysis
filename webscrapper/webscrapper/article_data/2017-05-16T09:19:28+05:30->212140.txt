Vadodara: Sessions court on Monday rejected bail application of cash-for-marks scam accused and founder of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth Dr Mansukh Shah.

 Shah, who is in jail since March 6, had applied for bail on May 3. During the hearing, Shah’s lawyer had argued that Shah is not involved in the case and the chargesheet that the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) had submitted to the court does not mention that he had collected Rs 20 lakh cash from the complainant. He had also pointed out that according to Prevention of Corruption Act he is not a public servant. However, the special public prosecutor Bhart Bhadami had retorted that Shah comes under the category of public servant according to section 2 of Prevention of Corruption Act. Bhadami had also told the court that Shah has been running an educational racket and syndicate and is a white collar criminal.
 
 The additional district judge K M Sojitra while rejecting Shah’s bail plea said that though the ACB has filed the chargesheet, other agencies like the Enforcement Directorate, Income Tax department, Vadodara collectorate and district development officer of Vadodara are probing irregularities of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth and Shah. The court upholding arguments of prosecution also mentioned in its order that if Shah will be released on bail there are possibilities that investigations of the agency will be hampered and he may influence the witnesses and the evidences. 
 
 Arrested on February 28 for taking a bribe of Rs 20 lakh from a student to allow her to sit in exam, Shah had pleaded for bail earlier too but after several hearings the plea was withdrawn unconditionally.
