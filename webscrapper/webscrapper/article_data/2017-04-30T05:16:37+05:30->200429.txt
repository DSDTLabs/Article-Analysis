MUMBAI: In an order that will bolster the cause of accident victims, a   has said that an acquittal in criminal proceedings will not discharge the accused's liability from the case before the tribunal. 

 The tribunal's observations came in an order directing BEST to pay a compensation of around Rs 3.20 lakh to a cyclist, Anil Munj (50), who was injured after one of the transport undertaking's buses knocked him down in Girgaon in 2011. 
 
 The court reasoned that in a   the degree of proof has to be that which is beyond reasonable doubt. However, in applications before it, inquiry only on the basis of preponderance of probability of negligence is to be decided. "Merely on the grounds that the driver of the offending bus is acquitted in a criminal case, it cannot be inferred that he was not negligent. The driver was acquitted in the criminal case on the basis of benefit of doubt. However, the opposite party has not disputed involvement of BEST bus in the accident," the tribunal said. 
 
  The BEST had told the tribunal that the driver was also exonerated in a departmental enquiry. Munj told TOI that he welcomed the verdict but lamented at its arrival five years after he first moved the application. "Such cases need to be fast-tracked. The whole idea behind seeking compensation is to be able to deal with the mammoth expenses incurred in the treatment and recovery days. We had to borrow money and it has accumulated high interest. With delayed compensation, the purpose is defeated," he said. 
 
 Munj in his plea told the court that the incident took place on the morning of March 31, 2011. He said that he was heading towards Charni Road station on his bicycle in slow speed and on the left side of the road. Munj further stated that suddenly the bus came from behind in high speed and rammed into the bicycle. He told the tribunal that he had suffered severe injuries to his leg and was admitted in hospital until April 24, 2011.
