PANAJI: After continuing to be in a state of limbo for a while, Goa is now witnessing the implementation of   in its vehicles in full swing.

 According to the amendments to Rule 118 of the Central Motor Vehicles Act, 1989,   governors are required to be fitted in   vehicles manufactured on or after October 1, 2015, with a maximum preset speed limit of 80 kmph. The order was issued by the   to curtail the speed of heavy vehicles.
 
  In Goa, taxis above eight-seater capacity, goods vehicles, tempos, buses and trucks are required to install them.
 
 After missing deadlines in September and November, 2016, the notification was in limbo for a while.
 
 Transport officials had lamented that the lack of traders dealing in the sale of speed governors and workshops that install the same in the state, had led to the delay in swift implementation of this rule. Due to the lack of infrastructure in the state, the transport department had instructed interstate bus drivers to install speed governors from dealers in neighbouring states.
 
 “With workshops now equipped with this technology, people have begun installing speed governors. Some dealers are also offering to fit speed governors during the purchase of a new vehicle,” a transport official told TOI.
 
 The installations began from February 1 onwards. To ensure that the rule is strictly followed, RTOs across the state have started refusing to renew fitness certificates of vehicles that turn up sans installation.
 
 “An average of five to 10 vehicles come to us each day for renewal of fitness certificate. We don’t entertain them if they don’t have speed governors installed,” a   RTO official said.
 
 Having recently installed speed governors on his container vehicle of four years, Edmund Vaz said, “Since the Supreme Court directive has made it mandatory to install them, we have. But only time will tell whether or not its implementation works for vehicles in Goa.”
