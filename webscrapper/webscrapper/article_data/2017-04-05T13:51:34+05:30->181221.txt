PUNE: Osmanabad MP  , who has been blacklisted by almost all  , has alleged that innocent people bearing surname similar to his were being hassled by various carriers.

 Gaikwad was blacklisted after he beat up an Air India (AI) staffer on March 24 in Delhi over a seat row. “The behaviour of the airlines should not cause any inconvenience to the innocent passengers because their names resemble to that of the MP,” Jitendra Shinde, personal assistant of the MP, said while speaking on Gaikwad’s behalf.
 
 Shiv Sena said the MP has so far tried to book himself on four flights. “The rumour that the MP tried to book tickets on many flights are flase,” Baburao Ramrao Shahpure, Sena head of Omerga, said in a statement.
