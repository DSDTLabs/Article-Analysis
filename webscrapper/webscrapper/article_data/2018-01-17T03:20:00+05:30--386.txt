Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has taken action against two staffers of Dhantoli Zone — assistant civil engineer Shyam Dharmamali and sanitary worker Sanjay Luderkar — for releasing vending carts without recovering penalty and seeking permission of deputy municipal commissioner. Two staffers are also facing allegation of extortion, for which explanation has been demanded from them.

 As part of the action, NMC general administration department on Tuesday transferred Dharmamali to Ashi Nagar zone and Luderkar to Satranjipura Zone. Show cause notice was also issued to the two staffers, asking why their two increments should not be stopped.
 
 Assistant commissioner of Dhantoli zone GM Rathod recommended the action after conducting an inquiry on a complaint by BJP corporator from ward no. 17 Vijay Chutele.
 
 Chutele’s complaint accused the two staffers of taking money and releasing vending carts. Interestingly, the two staffers claim the vending carts were released on Chutele’s orders. They also refuted allegations of taking money in their replies to the show cause notice.
 
 The two staffers had seized 10 vending carts near Rajabaksha Hanuman temple in front of GMCH during an anti-encroachment drive on November 12. Rathod had recommended action for releasing vending carts without recovering penalty and permission from deputy municipal commissioner.
 
 A couple of days ago, Chutele had lodged another complaint with municipal commissioner Ashwin Mudgal against the two staffers. Referring to a call from another BJP corporator Balya Borkar, Chutele alleged that the two staffers asked for Rs2 lakh from the owner of a car showroom for not taking any action against a ramp constructed on the footpath.
 
 Refuting the extortion allegations, Dharmamali had told TOI Chutele was taking revenge on him and Luderkar for their action against encroachments by shops situated on Great Nag Road.
