MUMBAI: The   (TISS) is facing an identity crisis of sorts. The status of the institute as a 'private' deemed-to-be university in government records has affected funding for   scholarship since 2014. While   is a public-funded deemed university, the perception is it is a private autonomous institute like other deemed universities in the state. The institute has now been asked to sort out the matter with the state's higher and technical education department. 

 In a letter dated August 10, 2017, addressed to the registrar, the social justice department mentioned SC, OBC, VJNT and SBC students can avail the   through direct benefit transfer. The same letter said OBC students from private deemed universities and self-financed universities are not eligible for GOI-PMS. However, SC students from such institutes are eligible. 
 
 "The state has been considering us a private university. This has been a hindrance in getting funds from the centre. There are only eight public-funded deemed-to-be universities in the country and TISS is the largest," said dean of student affairs PK  . 
 
 "We have been in constant communication with the government to include our name in the list of beneficiaries. We could not have told our students to apply directly for the GOI-PMS as TISS's name did not figure in the online system," added Shajahan. 
 
  The protesting students alleged officials did not inform them about the application date and the March 23 deadline is fast approaching. The institute is trying to work out a possibility of offline application as the matter of inclusion of TISS's name is still under consideration. 
 
 "Only OBC scholarship is a problem since TISS is considered a private deemed university. We have asked them to get the problem sorted with the higher and technical education department," said Dinesh Waghmare, secretary, social justice, after TISS officials met him on Monday.
