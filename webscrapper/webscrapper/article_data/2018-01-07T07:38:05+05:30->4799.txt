CHANDIGARH: Leader of opposition in   assembly   on Saturday targeted chief minister   for defending a “habitual offender and tainted minister”   Gurjeet Singh.

 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader said once again Rana had come under fire for allegedly violating the   Management Act ( ) and “indulging in money laundering for which the Enforcement Directorate(ED) had on Friday sent a notice to his son”. The ED authorities have summoned the cabinet minister’s son Rana Inder Partap Singh on January 17, with regard to raising of funds by floating shares abroad amounting to around Rs 100 crore. 
 
 Khaira said that the CM should have dismissed Rana from his cabinet long back when his name had first cropped up in the infamous sand mines auction scam. The AAP leader further alleged that Rana was also involved in forcible illegal occupation of a house in   owned by an ex-serviceman. “Rana Gurjeet has also been accused of cheating the sugarcane farmers to the tune of Rs 11,000-12,000 per trolley by wrongly weighing their product in his sugar mill at village Buttar in district Amritsar, a video to this effect has gone viral on the social media,” Khaira claimed.
