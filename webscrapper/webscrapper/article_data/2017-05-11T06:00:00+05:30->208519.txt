KOLKATA: The Joka-BBD Bag   corridor construction has now entered a site that had once threatened to jeopardize the entire project.   (RVNL), the executing agency of the  , pulled down the wall of the Mint complex. The  , which owns the mint, had reservations against allowing any construction in its vicinity. It took a long time and a lot of persuasion for the ministry to issue an NOC.

 The periphery wall of the Mint complex on Diamond Harbour Road will now be pushed back by about 10m to accommodate the construction of the column for the Metro viaduct. The southern part of the wall has already been realigned and reconstructed. 
 
 “RVNL is aware of the aesthetic and architectural splendour of the complex, so we are re-erecting the wall immediately after pulling it down to carve out the construction site,” said an RVNL officer.
 
 “The width of the land required for the construction of the viaduct along the Mint complex varies from 6six to 12 metres. We will not only restore the exact look of the periphery, but will also ensure safety and security of the Mint,” said RVNL executive director Rajesh Prasad. 
 
 During the construction, the ornate twin-domed gate might also suffer a little damage. But it, too, will be reconstructed, promised officials. 
 
 The Mint was one of the biggest stumbling blocks for the Metro alignment project. The delayed NOCs from the ministries of finance and defence had already pushed back work. Sanctioned in 2011, it took nearly six years to construct column within the Mint complex. Recently, however, the construction gained momentum with the resolution of land issues. The ministry of railways has also sanctioned Rs 580 crore after 72% of depot land was acquired.
