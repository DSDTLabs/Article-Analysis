Trichy: The price of lemon, which is a most sought-after fruit during summer, is skyrocketing in Trichy. A kilogram of lemon is priced at Rs90 to Rs120 in the wholesale Gandhi Market in Trichy on Thursday with a lemon costing anywhere between Rs6 and Rs8.

 Wholesale traders said the price was the highest in three years. Usually Gandhi market sees large bags of lemon arriving from Siruvachur, Perambalur, Thuraiyur and Manapparai. Four to five tonnes of lemon would be sold to retailers in Gandhi market every day. However, water shortage has hit the supply of lemon and the merchants were getting only 3 to 4 tonnes a day, P Venkateswaran, a wholesale trader in Gandhi market, said. “If the local supply is poor, we used to buy lemons from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Unfortunately, we are not able to get it from there this season, due to poor harvest,” he added.
 
 First quality lemons are being sold at Rs120 per kilogram and second quality Rs100. It was just Rs60 to Rs70 for the last three years. Due to severe drought during 2015-16, the price had gone up to Rs7 for a lemon.
 
 Due to the price hike, S Parthiban, roadside pushcart fresh juice vendor in Tennur in the city, has hiked the price of sarbath with lemon from Rs10 to Rs15. “I purchased a kilogram of lemon for Rs70 to Rs80 two weeks ago. The growing demand, because of the soaring heat, is the main reason for the price hike,” he said.
