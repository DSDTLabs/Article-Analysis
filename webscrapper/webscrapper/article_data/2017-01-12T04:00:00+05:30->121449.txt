Vadodara: Nobel laureate professor Venkatraman Ramakrishnan aka Venki wants the campus of his alma mater to be free from traffic.

 After interacting with students in jam-packed C C Mehta auditorium, Venki said most of the campus is almost unrecognisable now. 
 
 “Parts of the campus like the Faculty of Arts and Faculty of Science are still recognisable but the rest of the campus is not due to new buildings have come up. It is much more crowded,” he said. 
 
 “I remember when we were studying, we were not allowed to drive inside the campus. Even the professors used to come on cycles while many of them would come walking,” he said. 
 
 “It is not peaceful now. I think it should be closed for traffic. It will be nice for students,” he said. 
 
 Venki received a hero’s welcome where the audience not only included students, teachers and university office-bearers but also his father professor C V Ramakrishnan who had founded the biochemistry department and Baroda’s young astrophysicist Karan Jani, who was one of the key researchers in the US-based LIGO team that detected gravitational waves envisaged by Albert Einstein a century ago. 
 
 There was a rush for autograph while a first year masters student Bhumika Pradhan gifted him a sketched portrait. 
 
 Venki himself is an ardent cyclist. 
 
 While observing that MSU had two widespread campuses including the main campus and Kala Bhavan, he had said that there could be a bicycle lane which costs much less than what a road would cost. As a child, Venki, used to cycle or walk to the campus. 
 
 “Baroda has grown like every other Indian city but cities have not been planned properly. No politician has said where Baroda will be 10, 20 years from now. This is true for every Indian city,” he had said then.
