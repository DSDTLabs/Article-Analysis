WASHINGTON: A bipartisan group of 130 US lawmakers led by Indian-American Congresswoman   has urged the Trump administration to continue granting work authorisation to certain dependent spouses of non-immigrant workers holding   visas. 

 The Trump administration is planning to end the Obama-era rule allowing spouses of H-1B visa holders to work legally in the US, a move that could have a devastating impact on more than 70,000 H-4 visa holders, who have work permits.
 
 The letter by US lawmakers to the secretary of homeland security   comes weeks ahead of the Trump administration's formal move to rescind the rule granting these spouses work authorisation in June. "The opportunity for H-4 visa holders to work has made our economy stronger, while providing relief and economic support to thousands of spouses, mostly women, who have resided in the United States for years," the letter said.
 
  "Many are on the path to permanent residency... Rescinding the rule will hurt the competitiveness of US employers and the US economy, as well as H-4 accompanying spouses and their families. We strongly urge you to reconsider this action," said the lawmakers. Signed by 130 lawmakers from the Republican and the Democratic Party, a copy of the letter dated May 16 was released to the press. 
 
 "We write to urge you to maintain the current regulation granting work authorisation to certain H-4 dependent spouses of H-1B non-immigrant workers," the letter said. According to a recent Congressional report, 93% of H-4 visa holders in the US having work authorisation are from India.
 
  "It is an American value that everyone, regardless of gender, deserves to be able to use and enhance their skills, be financially self-sufficient, thrive mentally and physically, and pursue their dreams," the lawmakers said, adding that the majority of H-4 spouses are women, and their inability to work widens the gender inequality gap. pti
