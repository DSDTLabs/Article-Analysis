MUMBAI: A proposal to honour minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas   with the Aligarh Muslim University’s DLitt at the varsity’s forthcoming convocation has ruffled many feathers at the university and elsewhere.

 Aligarh-based writer and former media consultant at   Jasim Mohammad’s January 11 letter to AMU’s VC Dr Tariq Mansoor lobbies for the DLitt honour to Naqvi in “recognition of his secular and nationalistic views and rendering of services to national (sic) and community”. “In the past, AMU has awarded DLitt degrees to many moneybags with no scholarly or academic achievements. Mr Naqvi is an educated and popular politician who has taken some very important decisions as minority affairs minister. His services should be acknowledged with DLitt at the next convocation,” Mohammad told TOI on phone.
 
 A source said AMU may hold its annual convocation in February-end or March. Though university PRO Umar Peerzada said the proposal to confer DLitt on Naqvi is just one of many and nothing has been decided yet, a member of the   said Naqvi’s name would be opposed when it comes up for discussion.“It will be devaluing DLitt if it is given to a person like Naqvi whose only contribution is that he is loyal to his party. AMU has played a historic role in shaping the destiny of Indian Muslims in modern India and we will oppose it if the proposal is debated in the EC meeting,” said an EC member.
