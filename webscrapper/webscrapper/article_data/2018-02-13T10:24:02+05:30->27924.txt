PUNE: Chief minister   on Wednesday gave a go-ahead to execute the multimodal transport hub at Swargate.

 The facility will integrate the public transport services —   rail, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML) and Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) buses, autorickshaws and private vehicles — to curb traffic congestion at the busy junction. The Maharashtra Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MahaMetro) had expressed willingness to execute the project to ensure better coordination among the transport services in the busy Swargate area.
 
 
  
  
 
 Fadnavis conducted a meeting in Mumbai on Wednesday about the facility. Officials of MahaMetro, PMPML, MSRTC, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and   (PMC) attended it.
 
 Confirming Fadnavis’ approval to the project, MahaMetro’s managing director   said his organization had been working on the multimodal hub for the past few months. He said MahaMetro would initiate steps to execute the project at the earliest.
 
 “The meeting with Fadnavis went well in terms of minimizing hardships of commuters. MahaMetro has started with the preliminary work on tenders. We are hoping to finalize the process by March. The project will be executed in two parts. The first plan is to construct an underground Metro station and establish a link between the Metro station and the MSRTC bus stand,” Dixit said.
