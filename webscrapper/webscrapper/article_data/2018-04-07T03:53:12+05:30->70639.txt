NEW DELHI: Sixty BJP MPs have requested PM Narendra Modi to designate December 26 as ' ' instead of November 14, the birth anniversary of India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. 

 
 The request was made in a letter written by West Delhi MP Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, which was signed by 59 other MPs. The lawmakers suggested that December 26, the martyrdom day of 'Sahibzades', the sons of Guru Gobind Singh, be observed as Children's Day. Verma suggested that November 14 be celebrated as 'Chacha Diwas' in memory of Nehru.
 
 Four minor sons of Guru Gobind Singh - Sahibzada Ajit Singh (18), Sahibzada Jujhar Singh (14), Sahibzada Zorawar Singh (9) and Sahibzada Fateh Singh (7) - were martyred during Aurangzeb's reign. "November 14 can be attributed as 'Uncle Day' or 'Chacha Diwas' instead of Children's Day as Jawaharlal Nehru was fondly known as Chacha Nehru," Verma said in the letter. 
 
 He questioned celebration of November 14 as Children's Day just because the former PM was fond of children. "So far, 60 BJP MPs have signed the letter. I will also talk to Congress MPs also," Verma told reporters. 
 
  "The Congress government imposed Children's Day on the birth anniversary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. We refer to Pandit Nehru as 'chacha' (uncle) so why don't we celebrate that day as Chacha Diwas. Since Children's Day is centred around children, I couldn't find anyone better than the four children of Guru Gobind Singh, the 'Char Sahibzaades' who martyred themselves, so why don't we celebrate their martyrdom day as Children's Day," Verma asked. 
 
 If the government accepts Verma's request, it will require amendments in the existing legal framework which earmarks November 14 as Children's Day.
