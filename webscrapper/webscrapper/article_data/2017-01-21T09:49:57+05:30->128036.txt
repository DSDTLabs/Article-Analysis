NAGPUR: Over 30% school-going children experience back pain at some point due to heavy school bags, reveals research conducted by the  .

 “Various orthopaedic paediatric problems like this have started to show up, which were not present earlier, due to the changing lifestyle. In all, paediatric patients account for 30% of the total orthopaedic patients in India. Most of them are also nutrition deficient,” said Dr RM Chandak, organizing chairman of the conference organized by   (VOS) on ‘Changing trends in Paediatric Orthopaedics’ from January 26.
 
 Chandak said, “Vitamin D deficiency is on top of the list when it comes to nutrition deficiency. These days, children don’t get enough exposure to sunlight. The reason can be growing pressure of school and also because they have become addicted to gadgets.”
 
 “To upgrade surgeons with the new trends in treatment, topics like hip preservation, club foot, cerebral palsy etc found in kids have been chosen,” said VOS president Dr Alankar Ramteke.
 
 “Earlier, such lifestyle oriented paediatric orthopaedic disorders were seen less in rural areas, surprisingly, the gap is reducing. The development in rural areas is coming at a cost, so we now find good number of children with Vitamin D deficiency in rural areas too,” said Dr Sudhir Soni, another organizing chairman of the conference.
 
 Total 12 international faculty are going to be a part of the conference. Orthopaedic surgeon Dr   from Canada is going to talk on advances in treatment of club foot. Pirani has played a vital role in community service and undertaken training in core areas of South Africa. Around 150 research papers are going to be presented during the conference.
