NAGPUR: Nagpur Municipal Corporationâ€™s move to curb civic misdemeanours through nuisance detection squad received a jolt as six out of 46 civic cops appointed in December last year resigned citing non-cooperation from elected members and officials from all 10 zones.

 A senior health officer (sanitation) told TOI the   had appointed one commandant, 45 security assistants including zonal squad leaders. The general body had sanctioned 87 personnel for the squad but only 46 were recruited initially.
 
 With the squad in place, NMC had started penalizing violators from December 11 last year. Security assistants, requesting anonymity, said they began facing protests from not just violators but also from some corporators. Maximum interference was reported in Gandhibagh, Laxmi Nagar, Satranjipura and   zones.
 
 They claimed a corporator from Aashi Nagar zone had prevented from taking action against a builder for dumping construction material on footpath and on portion of road.
 
 Many violators not only used abusive language but also threatened them with dire consequences. Despite bringing this to the notice of zonal officers, civic cops did not get any support.
 
 According to data with the health department, civic cops in December had penalized 1,453 violators and collected over Rs4.27 lakh as fine. In January, 1913 Nagpurians were caught and Rs11.79 lakh were recovered. This month till February 5, the squad had booked 236 and collected Rs1.86 lakh. The violators included 983 vendors encroaching on roads-footpaths, 468 who dumped garbage in open, 394 found urinating in open and 122 for spitting.
 
 The officer said NMC will be filling all vacancies and will ensure full cooperation to the civic cops.
