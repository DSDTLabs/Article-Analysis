 (BHAGALPUR): The breach in the Bateshwar Ganga Pump Nahar Pariyojana (BGPNP) canal, scheduled to be inaugurated by CM Nitish Kumar on Wednesday, has caused panic among the residents of Kahalgaon.

 Being described by experts as a setback to the ambitious irrigation scheme and embarrassment to the state government, the breach on Tuesday evening caused the Ganga to swell, leading to a flood-like situation in Kahalgaon.
 
 The breach occurred when water resources department engineers were conducting a trial run of the BGPNP. It resulted in inundation of several areas, including the Kahalgaon Super Thermal Power Project township, in Kahalgaon.
 
 While the inaugural function was cancelled, steps were initiated on a war footing to repair the breach. Efforts were also on to channelize the canal water to low-lying areas and clear the sludge from the residential areas that had been marooned.
 
 “Technical teams are visiting the site to probe the reasons of the breach,” an official said, adding a fresh date for the inauguration would be finalised after restrengthening the canal and a certification to the effect by technical experts 
 
 The project, started in 1977, is aimed at providing irrigation facility to 27,603 hectares of farm land in Bihar and neighbouring Jharkhand. The estimated and approved cost originally was Rs 13.88 crore, which is learned to have increased to Rs 828 crore by the time it was completed.
 
 Meanwhile, RJD’s Pirpainty MLA Rambilas Paswan has demanded action against the engineers and contractors involved in the BGPNP execution. RJD workers also burned an effigy of the state government on Wednesday. 
 
 Congress’s Kahalgaon MLA Sadanand Singh termed the incident as unfortunate and demanded a probe into it. He also wondered why the trial flow of water into the canal channel was done only a day before its scheduled inauguration by the CM.
