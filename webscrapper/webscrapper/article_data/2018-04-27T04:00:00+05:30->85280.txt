Surat: At least 5 lakh people of Rander and Athwa in west and south west municipal zones in the city have been getting stinking and yellow-coloured water for the past 48 hours. The water quality deteriorated ever since the water level at the weir-cum-causeway got reduced.  “We have a problem of damaged sewers and low water level in the weir-cum-causeway. There was ammonia formation due to sewage from Chapara Bhatha Khadi and cowsheds at Katargam getting mixed with water,” said A H Khatwani, additional city engineer of the hydraulic department at SMC.  SMC officials were forced to reduce pumping of water from the waterworks at Rander and Katargam in view of poor quality water getting worse due to ammonia formation.  The water level at the weir-cum-causeway at Singanpore had dipped to 4.6 metre two days ago, forcing Ukai dam authorities to release water at the rate of 2,000 cusecs into the Tapi river to raise the level at the weir to 5 metre.  “Today, the level has risen to 5 metre, but we had to carry out super-chlorination to stop ammonia stink and yellow colouring of the water. We are now supplying water from French well to people in Athwa as it is pure,” said Khatwani. Meanwhile, SMC officials said they have taken steps to make sure that the water neither stinks nor has yellow colour.  The civic body draws nearly 1,150 MLD of water on a daily basis from Tapi and supplies it to 50 lakh population living in the city. However, the water supply could be reduced because Ukai dam has just 21% of water left.
