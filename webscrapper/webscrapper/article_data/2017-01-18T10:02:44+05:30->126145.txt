GUWAHATI: The Kamrup (Metro) district administration has asked organizers of   and the   (IWT) department to follow   following Saturday's   in Patna which left 24 people dead. 

 M Angamuthu, deputy commissioner and chairman of the district disaster management authority, has asked the director of the IWT department and the River Police SP to submit a detailed report on the steps taken to ensure safety within 30 days.
 
 "All measures adopted by boat service providers will be checked. We will see if the service providers, who function under the IWT department, have the necessary permits and safety certificates. There are instances where people have suffered due to the negligence of the service providers," said Angamuthu.
 
 If found to be neglecting passenger-safety norms, the boat owners and the department officials would be punished, he said.
 
 Angamuthu's orders will be applicable to all boat service providers who operate in the metro zone of the Brahmaputra. 
 
 Boats are a major mode of communication for thousands of people who come to the city from North Guwahati daily. 
 
 "With regular traffic snarls on the Saraighat bridge, we prefer to travel by ferries and boats. Unfortunately, the condition of most of the boats is very poor. They lack life-jackets and other safety devices. Mostly, they are overcrowded," said Ramen Saikia, a government employee who commutes by boats, said.
