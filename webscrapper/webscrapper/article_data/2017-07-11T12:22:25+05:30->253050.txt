PUNE:   (RTS) commissioner Swadheen Kshatriya has urged state government departments to respond to a case about notifying of   by them. 

 RTI activist Shailesh Gandhi had alleged that the departments were misinterpreting the RTS Act and were seen “choosing the service” to notify for the public, rendering the statute meaningless. The Act had stated that notification of services should be done time to time by all departments. 
 
 After listening to Gandhi’s contention on Monday, Kshatriya asked all departments concerned to respond to the allegations in the next hearing.
 
 Attending the first hearing, Gandhi said the RTS states that laws had called for registration of services from time to time that meant about notifying new services. He alleged that the Act “seems to be grossly misinterpreted, as it was seeing each public authority choosing the service to be notified... It would be rendered meaningless and cannot be called a law.”
 
 He later told TOI that a law cannot leave the choice of adherence on everyone. If each department and authority were to draw their own interpretation, most departments and public authorities would not offer most services to the citizens and there would be no way by which we can enforce the law. This was the first case where I spoke out against the interpretation after the commission was set up,” he said.
 
 Last week, Kshatriya conducted a workshop in Pune to educate all government officials about the Right to Services Act. “I have heard the case and have taken note of the allegations. I have asked the departments to respond,” Kshatriya told TOI. 
 
 At present, 393 services are registered from 50 odd departments and he has called for more services to be registered.
