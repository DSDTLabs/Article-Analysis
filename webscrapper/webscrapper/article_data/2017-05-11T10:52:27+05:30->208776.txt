VARANASI:  , seeking admission to the  ,   (BHU) from various parts of the country and abroad, would get a new   by the next year. 

 Srijan Kunj Mahila hostel is especially dedicated to girl students pursuing courses and the research work being conducted by five departments of the fine arts faculty. The department has 800 students, half of whom are girl students, pursuing courses in painting, textile, sculpture, applied arts and pottery.
 
 The first phase, under which 150 rooms would be constructed, got underway on Wednesday. In all, the hostel would have 450 rooms. The five-storied hostel is being constructed at the cost of around Rs 15 crores on around 7,489 square metres. Initially, the ground plus two floors would be constructed. The hostel would have a seminar hall, two kitchens, two exhibition halls, two dinning areas, visitors' room, a computer room, a reading room, etc
 
 "It would be a boon for girl students most of whom come from small cities. Owing to limited seats in other hostels, we were able to accommodate only around 60 students. Now, with the construction of the new hostel we would be able to offer better hostel facility to more students," said dean, faculty of fine arts Hiralal Prajapati.
 
 He further said that after offering a decent hostel facility to girl students the varsity would like to move ahead with the concept of round the clock teaching and practicals. "Why cannot we have classes going round the clock. The work and imagination of our students has no boundaries. How can we limit them in fixed teaching hours," he said.
 
 The construction work has been awarded to CPWD with a deadline of 14 months.
