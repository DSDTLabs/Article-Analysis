 says   casts black British actors in American roles because they are considered "classically trained" and come cheaper for the filmmakers. 

 In an interview with a radio station, the 68-year-old legend wonders these artists play such parts without fully understanding the delicacies of the characters as they cannot relate with them, reported a leading daily.
 
 "They come here (USA) because there are more opportunities and they actually get paid when they work here," says Jackson. 
 
 Batting for his fellow African-American actors, the 'Avengers' star adds, "We've got a lot of brothers here that need to work too." 
 
 Talking about his upcoming comedy horror film 'Get Out',   says, "But I know the young brother (actor  ) who's in the movie, and he's British. There are a lot of black British actors who work here all the time."
 
 "I tend to wonder what would that movie would have been with an American brother who really understands it, in a way."
