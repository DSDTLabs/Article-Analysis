Mangaluru: Terming district minister B Ramanath Rai as a man “desperate for power”, Union minister for programme implementation and statistics D V Sadananda Gowda alleged that Rai was triggering communal violence in Dakshina Kannada in a bid on to hold on to power in the forthcoming polls.

 Gowda was speaking to the media after visiting the house of slain Sharath Madivala, who was attacked on July 4 and succumbed to his injuries three days later.
 
 Gowda said he would put forward a consolidated report about unrest in Dakshina Kannada during the central cabinet meeting to be held this week, and also send it to the ministry of home affairs.
 
 He said the district’s name is being sullied due to the political dominance of two ministers — district minister Ramanath Rai and minister for food and civil supplies UT Khader. “Violence is reported only in Bantwal and Mangaluru (Ullal) constituencies but prohibitory orders were imposed across the district for the past 42 days, and people from other taluks are suffering too. Khader and Rai are to blame.”
 
 Gowda said Rai is desperate with elections coming up, and had triggered communal violence in the region to woo a particular community. He condemned the booking of cases against Sangh Parivar leaders for stone pelting during Sharath’s funeral procession.
 
 He pointed out that CM Siddaramaiah visited the district last week but did not conduct a review meeting. “He also visited Bantwal taluk but did not visit Sharath’s house,” he noted.
 
 Asked why Gowda had visited only Sharath’s house and not that of Ashraf Kalaai, who was also murdered in a similar way, he said Sharath was from his organization and knew him well, but refused to comment on Kalaai.
