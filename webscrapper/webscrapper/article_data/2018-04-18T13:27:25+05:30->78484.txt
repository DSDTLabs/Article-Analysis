PUNE: After achieving the target of delivering passports to fresh applicants within 21-24 days, the Regional   Office ( ), Pune, is now working towards speeding up this process further.

 Regional passport officer   said he has held discussions with the authorities concerned in the police department to bring down the time taken for passport verification. “We have requested the superintendent of police (SP) in the areas under our jurisdiction as well as the Pune police commissioner to speed up the process of passport verification. The M-Passport Police App is already available that can be harnessed to bring down the verification time,” he said. 
 
 He said, “Due to the M-passport police app, the applicants do not need to visit a police station for verification. This technology can be used to finish the verification faster, thus, bringing down the time required for verification of each applicant.”
 
 The RPO, Pune has also planned to increase the number of tatkal appointments generated daily. 
 
 “Though the total time for issuance of passports has significantly come down over the last few years, there are people who need a passport urgently. To facilitate people applying under tatkal facility, we are increasing the number of tatkal appointments generated daily from 200 to 225. This number will be gradually increased,” he said.
