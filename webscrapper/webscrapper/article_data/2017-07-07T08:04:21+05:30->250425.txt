THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The   special court has acquitted all seven accused in the Happy   murder case due to the lack of sufficient evidence.
The case pertains to the death of a notorious criminal, Happy Rajesh, who had allegedly led the gang that made an attempt on the life of Mathrubhumi journalist V B Unnithan of Kollam.

 The prosecution had said that the accused conspired to murder Rajesh to destroy evidence of their involvement in the attack on Unnithan. Rajesh's body was found in his autorickshaw parked outside the   on April 28, 2011, a few days after Unnithan was attacked.
 
 Rajesh, 35, was reported missing from his residence on the evening of April 27, 2011.The prosecution had alleged that Rajesh was killed even as the police team probing the Unnithan case were zeroing in on him. It was alleged that Unnithan came under attack after he wrote about the alleged nexus between police officers and criminals in the district. The immediate provocation for the attack was a report he wrote in which he said that several police officers had attended a late night party hosted by a liquor contractor at a government guest house in the district.
 
 As many as 79 witnesses were examined during the trial. The case, which was first probed by the local police and then the crime branch, was handed over to the CBI along with Unnithan murder attempt case.
