CHANDIGARH: The   in Akansh   murder case,   Singh, was denied interim bail by Chandigarh district court but the court granted him relief and allowed him to attend bhog ceremony of his mother in police custody on October 2. 

 Singh is one of accused in the   of Akansh Sen who was the nephew of Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singhâ€™s wife. It is alleged that Sen was crushed thrice by a BMW car driven by Balraj Singh Randhawa who was in turn instigated by Singh to do so. Sen succumbed to his injuries at PGI. However, the defence maintained that it was a case of accident instead of murder.
 
 Singh had filed an interim bail application to be granted a temporary bail to complete the last rites of his mother. The prosecution opposed the interim bail application and stated that he should not be granted bail as the main accused, Randhawa, is still on the run . It was argued that it would be risky to grant him interim bail for 10 days.
 
 The court pronounced the order and dismissed the interim bail application but allowed Singh to be taken to the gurdwara in Sector 11, Chandigarh in police custody from 11am to 2pm so that he could attend the bhog ceremony of his mother. 
 
 Randhawa, who is still at large has been declared as a proclaimed offender by the court. Chandigarh police have also raised award money from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh to trace him. Police had challaned Singh in June this year.
 
 Singh has been chargesheeted under Section 302 (punishment for murder) and Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC.
