The recently-released trailer of Welcome To   gives a sneak peek of   and   Deshmukh’s comic moments in the film. The filmmaker and actor have often shared the stage at award shows, where their punchlines have been applauded. In tune with that, even their lines in the film have been penned in a manner that will evoke laughter. In the film,   matches Riteish dialogue for dialogue. For instance, in one of the scenes, Riteish is brazenly seen asking Karan for a role, while the filmmaker appears nonchalant.

 On another occasion, Karan is seen telling Riteish, ‘Main Karan Arjun hoon’ to which Riteish says, ‘Main Rakhi hoon’ and starts singing the song Yeh Bandhan To Pyar Ka Bandhan Hai from the film, Karan Arjun. Exchanges like these promise to leave the audience in splits. 
 
 The film is a heartfelt, rib-tickling comedy that tells the story of two unlikely youngsters living in India in search of a better life for themselves. An unexpected trip to New York City sets them off on a comedic adventure that changes their lives forever. Director Chakri Toleti shares, “It’s amazing to watch two exceptionally talented men at work. Riteish and Karan complement each other on screen. They improvised their scenes on the spot to get their punches right.”
