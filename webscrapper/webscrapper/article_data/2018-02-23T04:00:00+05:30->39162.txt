Chennai: As many as 12 states, including Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Nagaland and Sikkim, have no government-sponsored health insurance, according to latest data with the IRDAI.  The Centre’s planned ‘Ayushman Bharat’ could act as repreive for residents in these states, as more states have pulled out of participation in 2016-17 from the current national insurance scheme Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna (RSBY), introduced by the UPA government. For existing health scheme RSBY, the number of states participating in it has fallen to 15, the lowest since 2008, when the scheme was launched. The number of enrolled families in RSBY, which provides insurance coverage of up to Rs 30,000 for annual fee of Rs 30, has dropped to 3.63 crore in 2016-17 from 4.13 crore in 2015-16 . The number of empanelled private hospitals also came down to 4,926 in 2016-17 from 7,865 in 2009-10.  “One of the reasons for non-participation in RSBY is political expediency. Many ruling party states have opted out. Then there are states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, which have their own state health insurance, and are implementing RSBY only in certain districts,” said an insurance official, with a public-sector insurer participating in RSBY.  “At the ground level there have been implementation issues. Hospitals have been reluctant to treat RSBY patients. Hospitals still demand cash from RSBY card holders and hold that as guarantee till they are reimbursed from the insurer. There are delays in settlement, lack of awareness on the programme and its coverage,” added the official.  Despite this, overall government sponsored health insurance has picked up and more people are being covered. In 2016-17, about 33.5 crore people were covered by government schemes, 56% higher than the 21.4 crore people covered in 2014-15. Gross premium collected has also increase to Rs 3,090 crore from Rs 2,425 crore two years ago. But the incidence of claims has also been on the rise, with claims shooting up to Rs 3,498 crore — 13% higher than the premium collected — making unsustainable over the long-term. “Currently 33.5 crore people are having government-sponsored health insurance from the state or RSBY. Ayushman Bharat aims at covering 10 crore Indians at a proposed Rs 1,000 per family. While TN has managed to cover 3 crore people at Rs 680-699 per family. It remains to be seen if the new scheme will work parallel to existing state schemes and how much it will increase insurance penetration,” said the official.
