SURAT: Members of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) opposed distribution of buttermilk by   ( ) activists in   area of the city on Tuesday. This led to an argument between   workers and PAAS members and the situation turned tense on Varachha main road. A police team reached the spot and detained seven PAAS members.

 BJYM had organized a free buttermilk distribution event in different parts of the city. One such event was held at Sarthana crossroads under a flyover where BJP MLA Kumar alias Kishore Kanani was present. A group of PAAS members reached the spot and began to shout slogans against BJP. They had arrived there shouting ‘Jay Sardar’ and ‘Jay Patidar’ slogans.
 
 The group did not allow BJP workers to distribute buttermilk to people and continued shouting slogans. The police team that detained seven people from the spot took them to Sarthana police station. 
 
 “BJP is looking at cheap publicity through buttermilk distribution when milk is becoming costly. There is inflation but BJP wants to divert people’s attention,” PAAS activist Dharmik Malaviya said.
