CHANDIGARH: Reacting to AAP's allegations,   (PPCC) blamed the opposition for a "deliberate and mischievous attempt to undermine the office of the governor with its blatantly false charges of mismanagement". 

 Responding to charges of inefficient handling of the event, a PPCC spokesperson said a panic-stricken AAP, unable to swallow its ignominious defeat in the Punjab assembly polls, it was trying desperately to defame the newly formed Congress government in the state by making false and baseless allegations. 
 
 The spokesperson pointed out that the complete arrangements for the event were made by the Raj Bhavan, with the Congress government not even sworn in till the completion of the ceremony.
 
 The AAP leadership, instead of accepting their electoral defeat gracefully and playing the role of a healthy opposition, seemed hell-bent on creating hurdles even before the Congress government was sworn in, the spokesperson said.
 
 This was evident from their behaviour at the swearing-in ceremony of chief minister Captain   and his ministerial colleagues, said the spokesperson.
