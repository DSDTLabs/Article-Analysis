Ahead of Justin Bieber’s India touchdown, Sarod maestro   gifted the singer a sarod as a mark of welcoming him to Mumbai for the first time. “Since Justin is a left-handed guitar player, this left-handed sarod will be easier for him to handle. I have heard so much about this child prodigy and hero of the younger generation worldwide, that I felt like gifting him this family sarod,” he says. 

 The left-handed stringed musical instrument, made of wood, has a steel finger board, while the belly is covered with skin. This, the   points out, adds more depth to its sound when compared to a guitar. 
 
 However, he isn’t the only celebrity to present gifts to the pop sensation.   star Ranbir Kapoor’s sister and jewellery designer  , has made custom-designed jewellery for Bieber and his mother  . Riddhima says, “We Indians are known to be hospitable. We believe in atithi devo bhava. Justin is already a living legend, so I have created customised bracelets for him with an Indian element.”
 
 We hear, many designers have also gifted specially made outfits to Bieber.
