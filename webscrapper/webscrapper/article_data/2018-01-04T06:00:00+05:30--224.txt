Nandakumar: Top Bengal BJP leaders on Wednesday scotched rumours about former West Midnapore SP   Ghosh joining the party after resigning from the IPS. 

 At a public meeting at East Midnapore’s Nandakumar, BJP leader Rahul Sinha said: “There is a rumour that BJP was in league with Ghosh in the run-up to the Sabang bypoll. This is just not true. She was removed as SP due to a clash between her and Trinamool.”
 
 Attacking CM Mamata Banerjee, Sinha alleged: “We were in alliance with Trinamool for 10 years. She no longer runs a party. It has become a private limited company. No one can speak against her or her nephew. She throws out anyone after using them. There was a time when she and Ghosh were like mother and daughter. Now, Ghosh seems to have outlived her utility to Mamata and she chose to throw her out.”
 
 Sinha added: “We never said Ghosh was an efficient and upright police officer. It was our party that complained against her to EC that got her transferred out of West Midnapore during 2014 and 2016 polls.”
