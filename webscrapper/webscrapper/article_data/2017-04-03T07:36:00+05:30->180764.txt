Amritsar: A man was arrested in Batala on Sunday for allegedly attempting to rape his 14-year-old daughter. The incident came to light after the wife of the accused filed a complaint with the police on Saturday, following persuasion by her in-laws to teach the man a lesson. 

 The accused has been produced before a court and remanded in 14-day judicial custody. In her complaint, the girl’s mother has alleged that she had gone out of the house to run an errand on Friday night. On returning, she found her husband making advances towards their daughter.
 
 Though she confronted him at that time, she decided against approaching the police. However, after she informed her in-laws about the incident, they convinced her to approach the cops. Her father-in-law accompanied her to the police station to file a complaint. The accused has been charged with sections 376, 511, and 323 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in a FIR registered at a police station in Batala.
 
 The investigating officer, assistant sub-inspector Ashok Kumar, told TOI on Sunday that the accused had been sent to Gurdaspur jail. Preliminary investigations revealed that the family of four, including the 16-year-old brother of the girl, lived in a single room in Batala. The accused worked as a factory worker and was an alcoholic, the family has claimed. “He was drunk when he tried to rape his daughter,” said the ASI.
