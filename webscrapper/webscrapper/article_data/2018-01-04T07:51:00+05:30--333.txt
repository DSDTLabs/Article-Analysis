Ludhiana: An undertrial was injured after a murder accused allegedly attacked him inside the Bakshikhana of the court complex here on Wednesday afternoon. The victim was identified as Chahat Puri of Dhandran Road. Police officials said Chahat Puri was declared a ‘proclaimed offender’ after he jumped bail in an ‘attempt to murder’ case of 2014. They added that the accused surrendered before a local court on Wednesday, after which he was housed in the Bakshikhana, where undertrials brought for hearing in their cases are kept after being brought from jail.

 Cops said the other undertrial Jassa — accused in a murder case — was also there in the Bakshikhana. They added that the duo entered into a heated argument because of a petty issue. Police officials said Jassa then beat up Chahat, and when the cops got to know about the incident, they rushed to the cell. They added that Chahat — who received minor injuries — was later taken to Civil Hospital for first-aid.
 
 Meanwhile, police authorities claimed they did not have any information about the incident. “We have no intimation about the incident, and no one has brought this to our notice,” claimed station house officer (SHO) of Division No.5 police station, inspector Jatinder Singh.
