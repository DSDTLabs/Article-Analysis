Vijayawada: The   victims and agents association are preparing to intensify their agitation. In a meeting held in Vijayawada on Friday, the association decided to meet chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu with a charter of demands.

 Honorary president of AgriGold victims Muppalla Nageswara Rao has demanded the state government take over the properties to do justice to AgriGold victims. He said the government should repay small and marginal depositors immediately.
 
 The association demanded the properties belonging to AgriGold chairman Avva Sita Ramarao and his family be attached and auctioned. “Some of the family members who held key positions in AgriGold were not arrested by the CID. We want everyone of them to be arrested immediately” said Rao. He appealed the government to keep verification centres open in all districts as some of the victims have not enrolled their names.
 
 Meanwhile, Telugu Desam Party and YSR Congress continued to trade barbs over the fiasco. YSRC leader Botsa Satyanarayana said the chief minister secretely met Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra and Amar Singh over the AgriGold issue.
 
 Planning board vice-chairman C Kutumbarao said the YSRC does not want the issue to be resolved.
