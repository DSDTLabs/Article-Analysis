UDHAGAMANDALAM: Making a collective effort to clean the tourist retreat, Ooty, '  initiative', a movement of the local citizens, has gained momentum in the last few weeks. 

 After conducting cleanliness and awareness drives at several places in Ooty town, 'Namma Ooty' has earmarked RC colony, a settlement near Fingerpost to launch waste management programme on April 22, which happens to be Earth Day. RC Colony, falling under ward number 1, is located in a difficult terrain within a pocket of forest area. The area is one of the most littered area of the scenic town as the Ooty municipality finds it difficult to reach the place. With absence of public toilets, open defecation is the norm. 
 
 'Namma Ooty' includes organisations such as Ooty travel agents, Maxi cab owners, tourist taxi owners,   district merchants,  , as well as concerned citizens.
 
 Recently, Nilgiri Tourist Taxi Association cleaned   area in Ooty. "Over 200 people participated in the clean-up drive. The locals were asked not to litter and to segregate waste," said Shadiq Basha, treasurer of the taxi association. 
 
 After the clean-up drive, 'Namma RC Nagar Vizha' will be held on April 23, when stalls manned by volunteers will create awareness on various issues.
