Ludhiana: Stating that their demands have been completely ignored by the Punjab government, the local businessmen have expressed their disappointment with the state budget.

 Apart from levying professional tax of Rs 2,400 — which has to be paid by the businessmen as well -- the government, contrary to the claims made by finance minister Manpreet Badal, has failed to implement the low electricity rates of Rs 5 per unit.
 
 President of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturer Association, (UCPMA) Inderjit Singh Navyug said, “The budget has proved to be very disappointing for us as industry has been ignored by the government. We were expecting new focal points and industrial areas for Ludhiana but our demand was ignored and instead the finance minister has said that only one focal point of Ludhiana will be upgraded.”
 
 “All the existing industrial areas need equal attention. Besides additional burden has also been put in the form of professional tax and at this moment it is certain that businessmen too have not been spared,” Navyug added.
 
 Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers Association said the finance minister had assured that industry would be given electricity at Rs 5 per unit by the state government, however, the industrial consumers were still being charged at Rs 9 to Rs 12 per unit.
 
 “There is nothing for the industry in this budget and the situation is still the same for industry. It has been proven that we are the last priority for this government as well,” Saggar said.
