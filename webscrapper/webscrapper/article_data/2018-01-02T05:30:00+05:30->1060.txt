 According to sources in the state horticulture department, the inaugural event will be held at 11.30am on January 8.
 
 History of the park
 
 In the year 1964, Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar gifted 62.14 acres of land to the state government. Of this, 38.91 acre is now in the possession of the horticulture department. This land is 7,600 feet above the sea level and average temperature in summer is around 10 to 27 degrees. In winter, the temperature hovers between 0 and 21 degrees.
 
 “The horticulture department has been working on this project since a decade and has spent around Rs 12 crore on developing the garden. About 60% of the garden is now developed and the rest will be developed in a phased manner,” said an officer.
 
 According to sources, the department has decided to fix Rs 25 as entry fee for general public and Rs 15 for children. “Vehicle parking fee will be collected separately. The department is expecting revenue of around Rs 5 crore to 6 crore annually through entry fee,” said the source.
 
 The garden was originally called as Fern Hill, but through a gazette notification dated September 8, 2017, it has been renamed as Karnataka Siri Horticulture Garden. The revenue from the garden will be shared with Suvarna Karnataka Garden Foundation, which is engaged in garden development and other activities.
