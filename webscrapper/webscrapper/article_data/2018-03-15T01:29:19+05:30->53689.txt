NEW DELHI: Deputy chief minister Manish   has told the directorate of education (DoE) to go for direct   to government   for   and uniforms. Last September, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had pulled up   officials for not ensuring distribution of textbooks and   among government schoolchildren well into the academic year and directed that all students must get their dues on the first day of the session. 

 However, according to an affidavit filed by DoE in the Delhi high court on Tuesday, it has been decided in a budget meeting that instead of distributing uniforms and books on the first day, the students of Delhi government schools would be given the cash remittance through   transfer, as was the practice earlier. 
 
 Last September, nearly 2 lakh students were yet to get the funds as their Aadhaar numbers were not linked to the related bank accounts, said a DoE official. This year, however, DoE wants to remit the amount to the students’ accounts timely, irrespective of the Aadhaar linkage. “The amount will be with the students soon after their sessions start in July,” said a senior official.
 
 As per earlier declarations made by DoE, the money is usually remitted to the students’ accounts after summer vacations and the distribution goes on throughout the session. Because of this rolling payment, parents and students have to either spend on their own to get the books or go to school without books if the expenditure is too high for them.
