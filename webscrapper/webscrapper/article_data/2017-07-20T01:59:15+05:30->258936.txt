NEW DELHI: The kidnappers of   used the clever ruse of mingling with   and constantly shifting from one place to another. It was, therefore, one of the most challenging pursuits in recent times for the   teams.

 While evading the police pursuers, the kidnappers moved from place to place in the company of Kanwariyas, who are currently on the roads in UP in large groups. This not only helped them move around undetected, but they knew it would also deter cops from confronting them. Sources say that even on Wednesday, when they were challenged by the cops, they ran into a large group of pilgrims, assured that the police could not risk shooting at them. 
 
 Three of them, armed with pistols, escorted the doctor every time they were on the move. Sources in police said that at least 25 Delhi Police teams were stationed in western UP for the past 10 days after the first ransom call was tracked to Daurala. Maan Singh Chauhan, SP, Meerut City, disclosed that Meerut police assisted Delhi cops in detaining the wives, mother and father of the accused to ensure that Goud came to no harm.
 
 On Wednesday, Goud was rescued from the house of Sohanveer Gujjar, who is yet to be taken in. Brothers Anuj and Sushil, Gaurav Sharma, Vivek and Pramod were arrested.
 
 The crime was planned in advance. Sushil registered himself as a cabbie with Ola on July 6, using a forged driver’s licence. He had tried to get himself into the cab-hailing company four times earlier but was rejected each time due to discrepancies in the documents he submitted. Goud was his first customer.
 
 Ola refused to respond to TOI’s request for comments on the criminal driver, but said the company was in touch with Goud’s family members. The doctor’s father and elder brother reached Delhi on July 8 after receiving a video clip, in which Goud said he was okay, but could not reveal his location.
