NEW DELHI: Past  , speedsters zooming around in their luxury   turn the city’s roads into kill zones. Once the traffic signals started blinking amber lights, the presence of policemen goes down. An estimated 20 accidents involving private cars take place on the capital’s roads with chances of 70% being  , the police said.

 The easy availability of high octane vehicles in the market with untrained drivers at the wheels are not only a menace, but also a hazard for pedestrians. Many blame the riskier character of Delhi’s night-time streets on the mismanagement of traffic by the police during the late hours. This is also the primary cause of the accidents.
 
 Joint commissioner (traffic) Garima Bhatnagar agreed that a stringent licensing rule and a proper check to prove whether a person is capable of driving a vehicle must be implemented. “We have often discussed changes in the road designs with civic bodies to ensure that the numbers of accidents are reduced. However, a holistic planning is required for training the driver first,” she said.
 
 What is worrying is that drivers of such vehicles, which are usually high pickup cars meant to be driven only after proper training, come out on the roads after learning the basics from a family member or a driver. They usually have no sense of the power the vehicle generates.
 
 A Delhi Traffic Police report shows that the total number of vehicles registered in Delhi in 2016 was over 40 lakh. In 2016, Investment and Credit Rating Agency (ICRA) ratings stated that the sale of   cars in India will see a 20% rise by 2016 and treble from 33,000 a year to 1 lakh by 2020.
 
 “To discourage people from violating traffic rules, the law needs to be spruced up with stricter prosecution provisions for offenders,” said a senior police officer.
