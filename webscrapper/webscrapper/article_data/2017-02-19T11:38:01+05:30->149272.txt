This is students’ exhibition but this place can also be utilized by art teachers and fresh passouts from art schools to show their work,” said   of Alag Angle.
 
 The three-day exhibition of landscapes was a first for many students. “This is the first time that a painting done by me is being seen by so many people. This is very encouraging,” said Harshita Rao, showing her landscape that captured moods of changing seasons.

 Kalakunj has more than 175 students who come to learn various crafts throughout the year at the two venues, the other being at Ram Nagar.
