Panaji: Chief minister, Manohar Parrikar and town and country planning minister, Vijai Sardesai met to discuss the need to create separate planning and development authorities ( ).

 Sardesai indicated that no concrete decision has been taken and appeared to suggest that the issue was on the back burner for now.
 
 “We discussed the issue of urban areas like a greater Panaji. If you see, Porvorim is much more urban than Fatorda. We need to look at the beach sides. But today, we met just to discuss what is our priority,” Sardesai said. 
 
 Recently, reports stated that former Taleigao MLA Atanasio ‘Babush’ Monserrate, who joined GFP, helping the chief minister to win the Panaji bypoll seat by more than 5,800 votes, was likely to be given chairmanship of a PDA after bifurcation of the existing north Goa PDA.
