PUNE: Environmentalists have opposed the proposed riverfront development project for Mula and Mutha rivers, claiming that the plan on the lines of Sabarmati riverfront development, will not work in Pune.

 Addressing a press conference on Friday, environmentalist   said, “The project should focus on giving a new lease of life to the river and not the riverfront. It should be a river rejuvenation initiative and not just a riverfront development project. The line of action, which the   has planned, is in the wrong direction.”
 
 Yadwadkar highlighted several anti-environment decisions taken by the state government and the municipal corporation in the recent past.
 
 Rajya Sabha member   said, “The   will not work in Pune. The project aims at promoting construction along the riverside. It will ultimately cause damage to the rivers than doing any good. We oppose the project the way it is being conceived.” 
 
 Urban planner   said, “Efforts should be taken to maintain the natural flow of the rivers. The Sabarmati model is not good for any city. It has stagnated water and caused several bio-diversity issues.”
 
 Municipal officials said over 44km stretch of the rivers would be handed over to the special purpose vehicle to develop the riverfront. The estimated cost is around Rs 3,000 crore.
