PATIALA: The city witnessed a huge traffic on Sunday after 22,586 students reached here to appear for the exam conducted by   ( ) at various centres in the city. 

 The   alone catered to over 5,500 candidates while the rest of the students appeared in around 46 colleges and schools in   marked as their centres. 
 
 Though the traffic police could manage the chaos to some extent, there were still some students who could not make it to their centres on time due to the traffic. "After the exam was over the city roads turned chaotic. The management of traffic in the noon was very poor following which the residents also faced a problem," said a candidate Kuldip Singh. 
 
 Around one-and-half year ago, the PPSC conducted the exam for 525 posts for which only 8,000 students appeared. However, this year a total of 22,586 students appeared for only 210 posts. 
 
 Last year, candidates were charged Rs 2,000 per exam, whereas each candidate was charged Rs 3,000 this time.
 
 Pankaj Mohindru, one of the faculty members, said, "The government generated a revenue of over Rs 6.5 crore by charging hefty examination fee from the candidates. The faculty was harassed and forced to do overtime. The institutions on Saturday evening informed that we have to reach by 8am instead of 9am, which was the scheduled time earlier. We are paid Rs 600 whereas in other exams we are paid Rs 1,000 to 1,500. There were no refreshments for the faculty. The poor traffic management even added to my woes as I reached an hour-and-a-half late to my home which otherwise takes me only 15 minutes from the university."
