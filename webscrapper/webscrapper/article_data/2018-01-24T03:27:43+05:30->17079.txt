KOLKATA: While the ‘Padmaavat’ debate rages,   is gearing up for celebrations around the legend for a reason completely its own. 

 The first-ever English translation of Jaisi’s poem ‘Padmavat’ was commissioned by Asiatic Society 129 years ago, and done by the legendary Raj-era linguist G A Grierson. Sufi poet Jaisi of UP’s   wrote ‘Padmavat’ in Awadhi-Hindi. 
 
 For the project, which he named ‘Padumawati’, Grierson tied up with Awadhi-Hindi scholar Sudhakara Dvivedi. The duo began work in 1889 and, by 1911, Asiatic Society had published six slim-volume editions of ‘Padumawati’. 
 
 The project was nearing completion when Dvivedi died, forcing Grierson to abandon the project. In 1936, Sultanpur commissioner A G Shirreff wanted to translate ‘Padmavat’. He knew about Grierson’s project and approached him and Asiatic Society for permission, which was readily given. In 1943, the society’s annual report said the book was ready. 
 
 Published in 1944, this version bears Shirreff ’s name with profuse acknowledgement of Grierson’s work. In the next few days, the society will hold a seminar on Jaisi’s classic with historians dispelling Padmini’s historical connect. 
 
 The debate will continue from January 24 at a meet of Paschim Banga Itihaas Samsad, a body of historians with an important role in organising the Indian History Congress.
