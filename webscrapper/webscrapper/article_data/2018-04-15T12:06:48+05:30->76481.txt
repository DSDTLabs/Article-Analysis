VADODARA: The stalemate over the use of   to carry load on the   continued with the donkey owners staying away from work even on Saturday. The owners have been prohibited from using donkeys – the only means of transporting goods beyond   halfway up the hill – for carrying loads over 50kg.

 The donkey owners as well as traders having shops and eateries on the hill have expressed practical difficulties in carrying loads in wake of the orders that are in line with The Prevention of Cruelty to Draught and Pack Animals Rules. They have expressed inability to carry coconuts and gas cylinders in wake of the orders and have sought revision of rates from those having businesses on the hill.
 
 “We are willing to work within the limits. However, each gas cylinder weighs over 30kg and it is not possible to carry a single cylinder. Same is the case with packaging of coconuts. We can divide the load of coconuts, but not cylinders. The businessmen say that cylinders are must and we have to carry them, but the law does not allow us to do so,” said a donkey owner Sanjay Rana.
 
 Donkey owners as well as the businessmen are yet to reach a consensus regarding the rate of carrying loads. Donkey owners say that if they are to carry lesser weight, they should be paid higher amounts. Rana said that the businessmen were expected to hold a meeting soon in this regard a find a solution.
 
 The district administration, at the other end, holds that things are on the right track and the issue will be resolved soon. It has suggested that smaller cylinders are available in the market and can be used.
