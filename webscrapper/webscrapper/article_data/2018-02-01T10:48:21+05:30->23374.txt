VISAKHAPATNAM: District collector   said that new proposals should be sent to the state government to ensure that Scheduled Castes and Tribes victims of atrocities are compensated properly and on time. 

 He was reacting to the recommendations made by members of the   Committee meet which met here on Wednesday.
 
 Addressing members of the committee at the collectorate, Pravin Kumar said proposals need to be sent for changing the rules concerning payment of compensation to victims. The collector responding to the pleas of the members of the committee said that they must send proposals to ensure that victims are compensated in such a manner that 25 per cent of the compensation is provided at the time, the complaint is filed and 50 per cent more after the FIR is filed. He pointed that only 25 per cent of the entire amount should be held back till the accused is declared guilty.
 
 The collector said that much of the compensation to the victims which amounts to Rs 5 lakh should be paid before the medical examination and final confirmation. The collector asked the officials to send the proposal immediately to the state government. Regarding the review of such matters wherein compensation might have to be provided, the collector directed the DRO to look into the issues.
 
 The collector urged the police department to take up such cases promptly so that there is no delay in justice. He also urged the police to raise awareness on such matters. The collector reviewed the development programmes taken up under the SC&ST sub-plan and ordered the officials to complete the tasks given by the end of February. 
 
 He further added that there should be no compromise as far as the implementation and execution of the sub-plan. He said all the money allocated should be spent on the projects.
