COIMBATORE: More than one-and-half tonnes of adulterated tea were confiscated from a company at   in the city by the   during routine inspection on Tuesday morning. A case has been registered against the owner of the company, who already has a case against him for the same offence.

 The food safety department officials found the adulterated tea at the company at   while conducting spot checks and inspections on tea godowns and companies across the district.
 
 “The owner had packa ged the adulterated tea in plastic packets and boxes with a local brand name,“ designated food safety officer Dr   said. “However, when we took samples from these boxes and put them in water, we found them adulterated,“ he said. The owner had mixed the tea powder with synthetic brown colour.
 
 Adulteration of tea is becoming a growing problem with many smaller tea vendors getting cheated into buying them. “They often cost as much as half or a third of original tea. So many tea shops and vendors buy them to reduce costs and make a bigger profit,“ said another food safety officer.
 
 The seized tea is worth at least ` 3 to ` 3.5 lakh. “However, a discerning tea drinker will find a clear difference in taste,“ he said.“Taste more than colour will give a clue if the tea is adulterated or not,“ he added.
