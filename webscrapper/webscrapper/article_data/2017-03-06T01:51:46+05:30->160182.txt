HOWRAH: A man and his daughter were killed on   after an overspeeding Digha-bound bus knocked down their motorcycle around 2pm on Sunday. Police said the duo could have survived had their helmets been strapped properly.

 The victims, Nayeem Ansari (54), a textile trader, and his daughter Neha Ansari (22), an IT employee, were on their way back to their Mourigram home. 
 
 The duo was very close to Moukhali on Kona Expressway when the bus rammed into their motorcycle. As a result, the victims were flung off the bike.
 
  A police patrol van chased the bus but the driver managed to flee abandoning the bus a few metres away. 
 
 The duo was taken to a local hospital where they were declared dead. 
 
  “Their helmets were loosely strapped and it flung off their heads when the bus hit them,” said an officer. 
 
 Earlier, chief minister   had expressed concern over a series of accidents and deaths on the Kona Expressway. She had also asked Howrah police commissioner to be more vigilant to check the number of   deaths. 
 
 After her warning, police have stationed a critical care ambulance on the expressway and maintained a stronger vigil. But locals claimed that vehicles, particularly trucks and buses, still indulge in over-speeding.
 
 Accidents on Kona Expressway are frequent mostly because of reckless driving and scant regard for traffic rules. The culprits — on most occasions — are big trucks, which lose control because of overspeeding. “Trucks and buses often make sudden turns, which increase the chances of accidents,” said an officer.
