 The commuters who use the road daily were pleasantly surprised to see the gleaming stretch on Tuesday, but added that it would have been better if the officials repaired the complete road, instead of the patch in front of the  . “On Tuesday , while returning from the office I noticed that there were no potholes in front of the RTO Office. It came as a pleasant surprise to us as this stretch was left unrepaired for months. However, it would have been even better if they had repaired the complete road as that would make commuting much more easier,“ said Sai Chand K, an IT employee, who daily commutes by the road to reach his office at Kavuri Hills.
 
 Another commuter, Vani S said, “I am glad that the corporation has started repair work on this road. I hope they will be repairing the remaining part of the road too as early as possible.“
 
 Last week, when TOI spoke to commuters, they said this road, which is earlier considered a short-cut to reach Malaysian Township from KPHB Phase IV, is no longer so as it is taking more or less same time to cover the distance as the road is full of potholes. Employees working in IT companies in   mostly take this road to reach their destination.
