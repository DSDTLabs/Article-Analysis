PUNE:   that came under the   ambit following the ban on   had deposited over Rs 50 crore as licence fee to the excise department for the 2017-18 fiscal, reaping little benefit from it.

 Of the 899 permit room licenses sealed in Pune district on April 1 following the apex court’s ban on highway liquor sale, over 850 had already paid the license fee for the 2017-18 fiscal by the time the Supreme Court announced its order on March 31.
 
 The apex court refused to revisit its order banning liquor vends within 500 metre of national and state highways from April 1 and ruled that this would also apply to bar hotels, permit rooms and restaurants on highways.
 
 The state government had earlier permitted highway permit rooms to renew licences for the current fiscal, based on an opinion from attorney general Mukul Rohatgi.
 
 Sources in the excise department told TOI that if the state’s denotification plan does not work out, the department will have to refund the fee, an additional task for the currently overburdened department. “Close to 95% of the permit rooms from the 899, whose licences were sealed, had paid the licence fee for the current fiscal,” said a source from the excise department.
 
 Meanwhile, the excise department had earlier stated that establishments that wish to shift their premises outside the radius mandated by Supreme Court can do so free of cost after applying to the excise department. However, sources here said that the department has received only two such applications since the ban and that too from wine shops. “It will be a humongous task for restaurants and permit rooms to shift their premises, hence no permit room has applied for this,” he said.
 
 On the proposal to denotify city’s highways, he said that the state government is yet to respond on the same. “Pune has 42 state highways, none of which has been denotified as yet, though they are maintained by the   (PMC) and are earmarked under the development plan,” he said.
