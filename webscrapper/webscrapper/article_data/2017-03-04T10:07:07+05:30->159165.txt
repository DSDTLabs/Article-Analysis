PUNE:   of China made the most of her tie break experience and opponent  's blunder under time pressure of the second rapid game to win the Women's World chess title in Tehran on Friday. 

 Tan, 25, seeded ninth, was just a WGM before the 64-player Fide knockout event. But her rating strength has been that of a real GM. Winning the World title will automatically give her a GM title. It was China's first title in knockout format since 2010. Even the men's Classical Matchplay World title last year was decided by tie-breaks when   prevailed over   after their battle was locked at 6-6 after 12 classical games.
 
 No. 2 seed Anna Muzychuk, a Slovenian-turned-Ukrainian, who was trying to emulate her younger sister Mariya's World knockout title in 2015, faced tie-break for the first time in this event after winning all her previous five mini-matches in classical time control. She had reached the final by playing only 10 games while Tan had needed 28 games, including various tie-breaks.
