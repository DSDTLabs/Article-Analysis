JAIPUR: A   minister known for his controversial remarks has now claimed that Indian mathematician and astronomer Brahmagupta-II (598-670) discovered the law of gravity over 1,000 years before   (1642-1727) did.

 Speaking at the 72nd foundation day ceremony of   on Monday, state education minister   wondered why the “fact” was not included in the academic curriculum. 
 
 “Since childhood, we have been reading that Newton discovered the law of gravity, but in reality, an Indian astronomer discovered it, if you revisit history,” said Devani.
 
 Amid criticism, the minister asked his detractors on Tuesday to read texts and books by Brahmagupta before passing any judgement on his statement. “An impression is being made that I have made a fictional statement. I would not comment on my statement. Rather, I would ask those who have expressed disbelief and shock to at least read the texts of Brahmagupta or read the research carried out on him by modern scientists,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, historians partially substantiated Devnani’s claim by presenting empirical evidence, including coins, texts and manuscripts.
 
 The head of history department at Rajasthan University, K G Sharma, quoted a Sanskrit verse from Brahmagupta’s book ‘Brahmasphutasiddhanta’ (628): “A body falls towards the Earth as it is the nature of the Earth to attract bodies just as it in the nature of the water to flow.” This statement indicates Brahmagupta’s understanding of gravity, which was later elaborated on by another Indian astronomer, Bhaskara II (1114-1185), in his book ‘Surya Siddhanta’ in 1150. Major texts authored by Brahmagupta include ‘Khandakhadyaka’ (665) and ‘Cadamakela’ (624).
