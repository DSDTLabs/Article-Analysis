KOLKATA: Presidency University’s decision to start the   early and publishing the   much ahead of other varsities has paid off with the institution receiving more   this year. 

 This time, 13,656 candidates will appear in 27,312 exams as each candidate has applied in two subjects. In 2016, 12,288 students had applied to take 24,576 exams.
 
 “Since we had decided to hold the entrance exams earlier, those who are keen to study in Presidency now has good opportunity to apply. They can make a choice based on the examination,” said vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia.
 
 “Holding admission tests on a later date would have meant many students interested to study in   would have to leave for entrance exams elsewhere. We had also advanced the admission examination to the undergraduate and post-graduate courses to ensure that no seats go vacant. The best students will be able to compete and take admissions in the courses now,” she added.
 
 According to sources, no UG seat went vacant last year but some vacancies could not be filled up in PG courses as the students had already taken admission to other varsities and classes had started. Education minister   had also asked the VC to ensure that the seats are filled up. 
 
 The university will give weightage in the admission test only to select students. “Merit will get prominence. The cut-off marks decided by the departments is only an application criterion,” said Lohia.
 
 In 2016, the admission exams were held between July 4 and 12. The merit lists were published in August, after which counselling process started. The classes could only begin in mid-August.
