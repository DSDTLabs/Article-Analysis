NEW DELHI: The   (CoA) has assured the Indian cricketers of a hike in payments for the 2017-18 season too. The committee had recently announced a hefty hike in the players' salaries for the last season.

 Hours before the   opening ceremony took place in Hyderabad on Wednesday, CoA chairman   met India captain   and assured him of adequate compensation in the next cricket season. "Since the 2016-17 contracts are already done, we will certainly consider the players' request for a hike in the upcoming season," Rai told TOI after his late afternoon meeting with Kohli.
 
 Rai revealed that the new payment structure would take around two months to be put in place. "We are not going to wait till September. We have heard the players and we will come out with a solution within two months," he said while highlighting the CoA's pro-active approach while dealing with cricketers.
 
 "We don't need an intermediary to deal with Indian players. I met Virat apart from other cricketers and heard their concerns on various issues relating to the game. The board would look into it and make appropriate arrangements in future."
 
 Meanwhile, it was learnt that the   office-bearers have been told to keep the CoA in the loop about the April 9 SGM in the Capital.
