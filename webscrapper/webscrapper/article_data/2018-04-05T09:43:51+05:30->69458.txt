INDORE: The child welfare committee ( ) on Wednesday divided into two groups after its chairperson objected over a decision taken by the members to handover a 9-year-old kid to the same family from whom he was rescued while working as the domestic help.

 According to sources, there is a ‘cold war’ between CWC chairperson Maya Pandey and other members from the day when the committee was constituted.
 
 The CWC had rescued a child, who was working as domestic help at the Jaiswal family house in Shantikunj area 17 days ago. The chairperson decided to handover the kid to parents, who live in Jhansi district. While childline volunteers agreed to her decision, the members of the committee said that the kid was not working as the domestic help and the family was bearing his education and stay expenses, so he should be handed over to them only.
 
 Amidst the ongoing tension, three members of the committee on Wednesday signed documents and handed over the victim to the Jaiswal family.
 
 “I will make complaint in the matter to district collector since it was unlawful to hand over the child to the same family from whom he was rescued,” Pandey said.
 
  Childline director   said, “The decision of handing over the victim to Jaiswal family is not right. We will approach collector against it.”
