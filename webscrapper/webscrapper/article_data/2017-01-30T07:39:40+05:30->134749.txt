AURANGABAD: Civic authorities on Sunday claimed to have administered polio drops to more than 1.50 lakh children as a part of the national pulse polio immunization drive.

 With this, said authorities, nearly 80% of the 1,96,839 kids in the targeted age group of 0-5 years have been covered. 
 
 The civic body will begin house visits on Monday, and over the next five days, aims to immunize the rest of the children.
 
 “The figure had crossed 1.50 lakh by the evening. Our teams are still active in the field,” said Suhas Jagtap, medical health officer of the   (AMC). 
 
 He added, “Special teams have been deployed at railway stations, private and state-owned bus stands, and will administer the drops well into the night. This will cover a satisfactorily high number of children in the first phase. The rest should be covered during our house visits.” 
 
 The AMC had put up 614 booths across the city, including at various residential complexes in Beed bypass, Satara, Devlai, Padegaon, Harsul, Mitmita and Nakshtrawadi. Booths were also set up in Garkhada, Bharat Mata Nagar, Mukundwadi and  , among other places. 
 
 Most public places as well as schools and hospitals had booths, making it easy for citizens to get their children immunized. 
 
 Around 1,831 AMC employees, including 115 supervisors and 32 medical officers, took part in the drive, apart from volunteers from various organizations and self-help groups. 
 
 On Sunday, municipal staffers administered drops to the children of labourers who work at brick kilns at Harsul, and at other places on the outskirts. The authorities also visited the under-construction sewage treatment plant in Nakshtrawadi, where 50 children of migratory workers were immunized. 
 
 According to Jagtap, these kids come under the high-risk category, and the AMC took special care to ensure they were covered.
