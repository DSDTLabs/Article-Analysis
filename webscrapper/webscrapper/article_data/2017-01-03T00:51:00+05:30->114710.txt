NAVI MUMBAI: A  , stone crusher and tar plant near the landfill site in   was sealed by  , Mahendra Kalyankar, on Saturday due to violation of rules. 

 The stone crusher was sub-let to another party which had violated the operational rules and the collector promptly sealed the entry to the quarry and the machinery, said NMMC additional commissioner Ankush Chavan. The quarry comes in civic area, but sources said, that it is under collector land and property jurisdiction.
 
 The quarry is close to the dog sterilisation centre and the dust particles were causing respiratory problems. 
 
 The health of 38 NMMC employees, including two veterinary doctors, a surgeon, 33 dog catchers and two para-veterinary staff was getting affected.
 
 The quarry operations had been stopped around six months ago. Civic commissioner  , taking note of the workers’ health, had held an internal meeting on June 10, 2016 and apprised the collector about the issue. The collector had responded promptly and operations were stopped from the next day.
 
 The civic officials said that the dust was affecting the workers’ physical activity and several had become weak and reported symptoms of asthma.
 
 But it was a temporary halt and, when it was found that the unit had violated norms again, the collector closed it .
 
 Four years ago, the then-NMMC commissioner had taken objection to the quarry and the collector had closed the operation, but a petition by the quarry owner to the minister led to the quarry being operational once again.
