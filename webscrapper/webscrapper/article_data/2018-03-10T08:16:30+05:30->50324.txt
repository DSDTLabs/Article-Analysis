LUCKNOW: A unique festival awaits PM   and French President   when they arrive in PM's constituency Varanasi on March 12. 

 The fest is titled ' '(garbage festival), whose purpose, officials say, is to create awareness on upcycling, recycling and reuse of waste products, into not just items of daily use but even musical instruments. 
 
 The idea of garbage fest came from Raipur's Kachra Mahotsava, which was held in January this year, and was praised by PM Modi in his ' ' radio talks. 
 
 Kachra Mahotsava, being organised by Varanasi Municipal Corporation, will display exhibits made out of waste products along with demonstrations on using waste produced in homes for making musical instruments. 
 
 A unique garbage vending machine, which as recently inaugurated by chief minister   in Lucknow, will also be put on display at the fest.
 
 "The idea is to spread awareness about making waste into a profitable business. There are umpteen options on what can be done with waste. Like organic waste can be used for composting, plastic can be used to make showpieces, coconuts as wall hangings, used paper into notebooks are just few basic examples," said Varanasi municipal commissioner Nitin Bansal. 
 
 According to Bansal, Kachra Mahotsava will provide a platform to locals to show their skills in the domain of waste upcycling and create interest among the masses through an interesting medium. "Since the trip has been very sudden, we have not got much time, but even in the little time, we have decided to involve school students and setup around 15 stalls with the exhibits," he added.
 
 The fest's venue is DLW Varanasi.
 
 On further plans, Bansal said, "By March-end, we will put up the exhibits from waste products at various points in the city for tourists and locals and hold more such festivals across Varanasi."
