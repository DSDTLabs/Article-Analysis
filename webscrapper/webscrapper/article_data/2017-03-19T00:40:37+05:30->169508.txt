NAVI MUMBAI: The   traffic unit has launched interactive sessions with housing societies to find solutions for haphazardly parked   and in crowded marketplaces. The traffic cops, after getting complaints, visit the locations and meet stakeholders in an attempt to get their suggestions to resolve the issues.

 The concept is an attempt to implement the odd-even   system in a better way while taking residents into confidence. 
 
 “We have started meeting people in various housing societies and business community to put some onus on them to resolve the issue,” said Pravin Pande, traffic in-charge, Kharghar.
 
 One can see double parking in areas like sectors 3, 5, 7, 11, 12 and 20, which results in traffic jams as roads have just a single lane to drive. “Almost all the roads have haphazardly parked vehicles and this is a good move by the cops,” said Srinivasan N, a sector 12 resident.
 
 Traffic cops have faced stiff resistance from   while dealing with illegal parking, prompting them to seek the assistance of housing societies.
 
 “We tried our ways to curb the menace of haphazard parking. Now we take the residents’ opinion, as even they have the responsibility to curb this menace,” Pande told TOI.
 
 He added that housing societies are asked to present an ideal location for single parking as double parked vehicles leave no place for fire tenders to move in case of fire. “We will implement odd-even parking method gradually, On the basis of their suggestions,” he added.
