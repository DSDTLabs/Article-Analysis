KOCHI: Vypeen boat jetty witnessed a huge influx of local passengers and tourists who were trying to use the boat services to travel in   on Sunday and Monday due to the New Years Eve celebrations and Cochin Carnival. 

 Majnu  , chairman Fort Vypeen Janakiya Kootayima said the rush was because of the sudden reduction in the number of the boats operating between Vypeen and   route. 
 
 "There used to be two junkars and a boat that used to connect the Vypeen boat jetty with Fort Kochi. Since the junkars stopped services earlier this month, there is only one boat to service this route," said Komath, who suggested that people had wait for more than an hour at the boat jetty. 
 
 He said the situation was worse on Monday because the additional boat service that was set-up between the customs boat jetty in Vypeen by the district administration for New Years Eve was not available. 
 
 "The state water transportation department (SWTD) has looked into providing transportation at the Fort Kochi corporation. The SWTD does not have extra boats, so when additional service was set up here for the past two days, other services had to be disturbed. We had intervened only to help with the extra rush," said K Mohammed Y Safirulla, district collector.
