KOCHI: Union labour and employment minister Bandaru Dattatreya announced the inclusion of migrant workers' families and retired insured persons (IPs) in the restructured model of   (ESIC) at a press conference here on Saturday. 

 Speaking after the 171st ESI   meeting, the minister said: "We have decided that both the migrant and the migrant's family need to get the benefits of the ESIC aid as well as medical support. The people who have retired from the service, which are in large numbers, will also be catered with super-specialty treatment. These services will be made available in all areas, including the newly proposed ones," the minister said. 
 
 Additionally, all the IP's who were earlier given Rs 2,500 per month will now receive Rs 3,000 instead. 
 
 "One-third of the total dispensaries in the country - there are 1,500 dispensaries in total - will be upgraded to six bedded hospitals. In Kerala, around 43 out of the 143 dispensaries will be upgraded to six bedded hospitals, provided that the state government gives land," the minister said.
 
 Three dispensaries in Adimali, Kasaragod and Munnar have already been sanctioned for upgradation. The proposal to upgrade Pothencode, Thiruvananthapuram dispensary into a model dispensary is under consideration, he added.
 
 "Earlier we had ESIC functioning in 392 districts. We will expand its reach to all the districts in the country," the minister said.
