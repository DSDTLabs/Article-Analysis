MUMBAI: A plan by the the Hindu Mahasabha to install a statue of Nathuram Godse, Mahatman Gandhi’s assassin, near Kalyan has raised the hackles of the opposition, especially the Congress. The   government has given an assurance that an inquiry will be ordered into the Godse “memorial”.

 The issue was raised by Congress MLC Sanjay Dutt on the second day of the special session to deliberate the goods and services tax (GST). 
 
 In 2015, Hindu Mahasabha announced plans to go ahead with ‘bhumi pujan’ for construction of a proposed Nathuram Godse temple in UP on January 30, the anniversary of Gandhi’s assassination. A month later in February 2015, a four-lane flyover in Alwar, Rajasthan was to be named after Godse. A plaque that read ‘Rashtrawadi Nathuram Godse Pul’ (Nationalist Nathuram Godse Bridge) came up at the site, but was removed after the media began asking questions about the decision.
 
 In December 2014, Unnao BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj left his party red-faced when he claimed that Godse was a patriot and a nationalist. TV channels showed Maharaj as saying, “I believe Godse was also a nationalist and Mahatma Gandhiji also did a lot for the nation. He may have done something by mistake but was not an anti-national.” 
 
 The opposition also protested against the state’s decision to celebrate ‘Voter Day’ on July 1, which is birth anniversary of former chief minister Vasantrao Naik. The week of Naik's birthday is celebrated as ‘agriculture week’.
