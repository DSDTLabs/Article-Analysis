INDORE: The Indore bench of high court on Friday dismissed the petition filed by former minister   challenging the construction of 108 shops and their allotment near   land in Pardeshipura. 

 During the hearing, a division bench of   and Justice   asked the petitioner to withdraw his petition as the issue raised was already decided earlier by the high court in a different petition. 
 
 When the petitioner refused to withdraw it, the court dismissed it with a strong reprimand to the petitioner. Seth filed the petition on June 20, 2017, against the state government and IMC commissioner challenging the allotment of 108 shops seeking a permanent stay on it.
 
 According to Seth, the construction of the shops was a misuse of the land which was allotted for education purposes and that the presence of shops would disturb the students. 
 
 The court had issued notices to the state government and IMC who had stated in their reply that the shops and the boundary wall helped in securing   college premises from illegal entry by strangers and unauthorized persons. 
 
 “The college can be protected through a gate and locks now which can prevent encroachments and trespassing,” said advocate Manoj Munshi, represeting IMC. 
 
 IMC also said the shops and boundary wall would help in keeping a check on encroachments from other shopkeepers, who might illegally put up their shops in the college’s vicinity. 
 
 Seth had previously filed another petition before the high court against the shops’ construction and had also filed a civil suit at the lower court which had been decided in the past.
