No untreated effluents flow into the river from Pachanady. We have all the facilities to treat the water at our treatment plants. We are not letting untreated sewage out,” she said. 
 
 Kavitha, who is also a member of KSPCB, suggested that the board officials take action against industries situated in the vicinity of the river which are polluting the river. “Don’t blame the city corporation and protect industries. Take action against those, who are contaminating the river. Let the board bring experts from Bengaluru and find out the cause of the pollution instead of randomly pointing fingers at the corporation,” she added
 
 Commissioner Nazeer said that the MCC treats the sewage from Pachanady promptly and the treated water is being supplied to Pilikula Nisargadhama to water plants.
