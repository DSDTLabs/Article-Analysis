PANAJI: Public works department (PWD) officials on Tuesday said that residents of   near   are just months away from getting a drinking water pipeline and supply. In the meantime, locals of the area, as well as those living in neighbouring Corlim, continue to struggle with drinking water issues as the summer peaks.

 According to records of the water resources department (WRD), five individuals and one residential complex have in the past two years received permissions to set up seven borewells on the   plateau for domestic use. Officials said that several others are waiting for   to grant them permission to dig borewells, nods for which are given after an inspection is carried out of the proposed site. 
 
 “Permission cannot be granted to two borewells within 100m of each other as it can deplete the water table,” an oficial said. “But on the Kadamba Plateau, as there are residential complexes and houses and no water supply pipeline, we have received applications to set up borewells within 25-30m of one another.”
 
 In December 2017, residents had decided to stage a protest questioning how authorities could grant construction licenses for homes on the Kadamba Plateau without making provision for water supply. “Two water storage tanks are ready,” PWD’s principal chief engineer   said. “The work of laying the pipeline is done.” 
 
 Executive engineering, PWD, Deelip Dhavalikar, said that the new 27MLD plant at Opa will be ready by December. The plant will be dedicated to supply of water to Panaji and Kadamba plateau, he said.
 
 Residents of nearby Corlim area too are facing restricted water supply this summer. This, officials said, is due to a drop in water level at Opa during the summer season. “Every few days, we shell out Rs 550-600 per water tanker of 700 liters,” said Anant Kamat, a resident. “As we are a big complex with 236 flats, we have to get two to three tankers at a time. .”
