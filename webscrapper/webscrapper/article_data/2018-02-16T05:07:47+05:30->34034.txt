 Ajay Kumar, scientist from IMD, Mumbai, said, "Temperatures soared due to easterly winds from land to sea. As the land gets very heated, the air blowing is hotter and there is a spike in temperature in coastal areas. The next three days, temperatures will remain above normal." 
 
 Higher temperature meant lower pollution levels as pollutants don't get trapped closer to the earth's surface. SAFAR recorded an AQI of 120 as against 170 on Wednesday. It is expected to improve to 111 on Friday.
