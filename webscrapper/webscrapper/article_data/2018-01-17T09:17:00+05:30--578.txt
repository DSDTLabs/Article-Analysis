AMRITSAR: The executive committee of the   (SGPC) has asked the   Jathedar to initiate efforts to restore image of a Sikh and his character to its pristine glory and take stern action against anyone belittling it. The resolution was passed in the executive committee meeting of the SGPC held here on Tuesday.

 Later, talking to newspersons, SGPC president   said the executive committee had resolved that the image of a Sikhâ€™s character had been tarnished by immoral acts of few and this could have an adverse effect on the mindset of young Sikhs. He said a few incidents had forced the SGPC to make such an appeal to the Akal Takht Jathedar.
 
 Some Sikh organizations and individuals had appealed to the jathedar and the SGPC to take stern action against the suspended president of the 115-year-old organization Chief   (CKD) Charanjit Singh Chadha after his objectionable video with a woman went viral. Earlier, a senior Akali minister Sucha Singh Langah was embroiled in a controversy after his objectionable video with a woman went viral too.
 
 When asked about the decision of a few gurdwara management committees abroad banning entry of Indian diplomats, Longowal said no one could ban anyone from entering gurdwara for paying obeisance. He said a delegation of the SGPC would soon meet the Prime Minister and the Union home minister to raise various Sikh issues.
