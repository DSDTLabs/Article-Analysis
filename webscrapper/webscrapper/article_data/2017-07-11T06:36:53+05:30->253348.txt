SECUNDERABAD: The opposition to the move to once again collect toll tax in the   area has intensified. After residential welfare associations of Malkajgiri, Alwal, Sainikpuri and adjoining areas strongly opposed it, the Secunderabad Cantonment Congress Committee has made common cause. 

 On Monday, Congress leaders, led by  's (TPCC) official spokesperson Manne Krishank met Union minister of state for labour and employment Bandaru Dattatreya and handed over a representation. They also met   (SCB) chief executive officer SVR Chandra Sekhar and gave a representation asking them to rethink the resolution passed in the board meeting.
 
 According to Krishank, Cantonment board authorities had stopped collecting taxes after the introduction of GST. However, the SCB authorities convened a board meeting on July 7 and passed a resolution to continue collection of toll tax. Krishank also made a plea to the Union minister to provide employment opportunities to the staff who have lost their jobs due to closure of checkposts.
 
 "Union minister Bandaru Dattatreya has responded positively and has promised to take up the issue with the central government," Krishank told TOI. 
 
 SCB vice president J Ramakrishna said, "I am demanding both state and central governments to pay compensation to the board to offset the losses due to abolition of octroi and toll tax."
 
 The representatives of RWAs are also planning to meet General Officer Commanding,   and Andhra Sub Area (TASA), Maj Gen N   to ask him to address the issue.
