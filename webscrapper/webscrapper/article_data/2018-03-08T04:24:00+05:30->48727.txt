Vadodara: M S University’s Faculty of Commerce has continued its record of goofing up question papers. 

 On Wednesday, when first year bachelors of commerce (B Com) students appeared for their exam in micro economics, the question paper which were provided to them had eight multiple choice questions (MCQs) which were repeated. According to students, while the question paper of set A of the subject had eight MCQs which were repeated, seven MCQs from question number nine to 16 were missing from the question paper. 
 
 The National Students Union of India (NSUI) also submitted a memorandum to faculty dean demanding action against all those responsible for such goof ups in question papers. The student outfit has threatened to launch a major stir if the goof up caused by the faculty leads to injustice to students. 
 
 This is not the first time that the faculty has goofed up its exam papers. Last year, a similar row had surfaced at the university’s biggest faculty when it had issued a question paper in which 14 questions were repeated.
