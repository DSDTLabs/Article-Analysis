PUNE: The names of as many as 15,000 residents living in illegally constructed houses in the jurisdiction of Pune and Khadki cantonment boards would soon be deleted from the voters' list. 

 A source said the   (MoD) had issued a circular in this regard to all  's   recently and asked Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of all cantonments to implement it strictly.
 
 According to the circular (the TOI is in possession of a copy), the   in Cantonment Board, Panchamarhi, vs Gopal Das Kabra and Ors case held that persons living in the cantonment area in illegally constructed houses, which are not assigned any number, will not be entitled for inclusion of their names in the electoral rolls to be prepared in accordance with Rule 10 (3) of the cantonment rules. The circular has categorically directed the CEOs to take prompt action against the illegally constructed buildings and encroachments on defence land. 
 
 The chief executive officer of the Khadki Cantonment Board (KCB), Amol Jagtap, told TOI, "A special drive in this regard will be carried out in the jurisdiction of KCB in the coming months. As per our estimate, names of about 10,000 voters will be removed from the voters' list of the cantonment." 
 
 Jagtap clarified that basic amenities like water, garbage removal and medical facilities would be given to these people, though. They are staying illegally in the cantonment area, but we cannot stop providing them with basic amenities."
 
 The people concerned allegedly encroached upon various defence plots in the past two decades and constructed houses illegally.
 
 According to sources in the   (PCB), about 5,000 people are staying on encroached defence land in the PCB jurisdiction. "The action against those constructions will be taken in the near future. The names of these residents will also be removed from the voters' list," a source said.
