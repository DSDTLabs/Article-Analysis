CHENNAI: The Madras high court has directed appearance of film actress and former MP,   in connection with a property dispute case.

 Justice M V Muralidaran passed the order on a criminal original petition moved by Vijayashanti seeking to quash an order passed by the chief metropolitan magistrate, Egmore, Chennai in connection with a property dispute valued at Rs 4 crore between Vijayashanti and Indir Chand Jain.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing, the counsel representing Jain submitted that the parties to the dispute are willing to settle the matter and therefore, sought the court to refer the issue to the mediation centre for settlement.
 
 Noting that unless the parties appear before the court and record their consent, the matter cannot be referred to mediation, the judge ordered their appearance on September 18.
