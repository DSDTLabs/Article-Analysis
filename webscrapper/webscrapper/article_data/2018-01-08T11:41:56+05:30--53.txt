PANAJI: Those selling   after completing all the legal formalities are free to carry forward their business as always, chief minister Manohar   said on Sunday.

 The inspector general of police has been asked to act against anyone indulging in illegalities, he said. “How can I ask officials to stop acting against illegalities,” Parrikar said.
 
 Beef traders in the state shut shops on Saturday to protest alleging harassment by NGOs and raids by authorities on beef being transported illegally to Goa. 
 
 They demanded the government should take over the task of transporting beef from Belagavi to the state as they do not wish to further risk their business. 
 
 Goa consumes around 2,400kg of beef daily and the state-run abattoir shut operations after cattle from Karnataka were being brought without due certificates.
 
 Last Friday, following a complaint by president of the Gau Raksha Abhiyan Hanumant Parab, police stopped a vehicle coming from Belagavi and attached beef worth Rs 10 lakh at Honda in Sattari. TOI had earlier reported that Goa police had confiscated around 1,300kg of beef that was allegedly being "illegally transported" from Belagavi to Goa on Christmas day.
