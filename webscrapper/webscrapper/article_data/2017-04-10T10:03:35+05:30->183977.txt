 Kaatru Veliyidai is an upcoming Tamil romantic thriller produced, written and directed by Mani Ratnam. Featuring Karthi and Aditi Rao Hydari in the lead roles, the film has music composed by A. R. Rahman and cinematography by Ravi Varman.
 
 
  A military pilot recalls a romance with a doctor while being held prisoner.
 
 
 
 
 
 - Mani Ratnam’s direction, which gives even routine scenes freshness; he is still the best when it comes to staging a romantic scene. A great example is the scene between Karthi and Aditi at a base camp in Leh.
 
 - There is chemistry between Karthi and Aditi; his inherent manliness and her sweetness go together very well
 
 - Ravi Varman's gorgeous visuals that make us feel we are in Kashmir
 
 - Rahman’s songs, which are peppy
 
 
 
 - The narrative device of a prisoner of war trying to escape and get back to his lady love feels clichéd
 
 - The conflict in the story isn't gripping enough
 
 - The leisurely pacing might not work for everyone
 
 What lets down Kaatru Veliyidai and stops it from being the film it wants to be is the narrative device that Mani Ratnam employs to tell his story — intercutting a romance with a sub-plot about the protagonist, who has become a prisoner of war in the present, trying to stage a prison break and get back to his lady love. It not only feels clichéd, but there is hardly any suspense in these portions; worse, they are preposterous and laughable, almost comparable with what we got in Wagah last year.
