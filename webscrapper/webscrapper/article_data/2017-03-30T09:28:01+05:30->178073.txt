NEW DELHI: A corruption-free government — this will be the centrepiece of   government’s three-year anniversary message in May. Two ministers,   and  , have been tasked with preparing the anniversary message. There will be ministry-wise comparisons to the previous Congress-led UPA government’s performance, with special emphasis on this government’s approach to graft-free administration.
 
  Senior officials familiar with these plans told ET that the massive mandate to   in Uttar Pradesh, which has been widely interpreted as popular affirmation of the PM’s   policy, will bolster the government’s showcasing of the note ban move as a demonstration of corruption-free governance.
  
  These officials spoke off record. Demonetisation will be explained threadbare in the anniversary message, officials said, and misconceptions will be clearly addressed.
  
  All ministries have been asked to identify schemes introduced by the Modi government aimed at reducing the black economy and helping specific target groups such as youth, women, farmers, senior citizens and differently abled.
  
  Third anniversary celebrations are significant as they come at the half-way mark of the Modi government’s five-year term. To make this anniversary message stand out, the format has been changed from ministry-wise report cards to a consolidated report with an overarching theme of corruption-free governance.
  
  Ministers will also hold special ministry-specific press conferences. In the run-up to the second anniversary, the PM had sent his ministers to different cities to hold press conferences. The practice is expected to continue this year. The government is also working on an extensive media plan to spread awareness about its propoor schemes.
