MELBOURNE: When   steps on the court at the   on Sunday, he will have one admirer more keenly willing him to lift the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup than anyone else.

 "Federer's records speak for themselves. He is 35 years of age and still playing. He is pretty much at the top," Aussie legend Ken   told TOI earlier this week. "I only hope that he wins many more Grand Slams." Rosewall's wishes will hold special meaning for Federer: if he wins on Sunday, the Swiss will become the second oldest man after Rosewall in the Open era to win a major. Rosewall, known for his thin frame and ironically nicknamed 'Muscles', is the youngest and the oldest champion at the  , having triumphed in 1953 as an 18-year-old, and later in 1972 at 37 years and 62 days.
 
 In fact, Rosewall won three Slams after the age of 35. After his semifinal win over Stan Wawrinka,   reciprocated the warmth and respect to the 82-year-old. "We don't speak about him enough," Federer said. "He wrote me a letter again this week to wish me well. He does it every year. Still haven't seen him, unfortunately. I know he's around."
