 The repeated complaints by the API have sent senior police officers in a tizzy. “We are trying to find out why she is repeatedly lodging complaints” a senior officer asked.
 
 The woman officer lodged a fresh complaint with the Hinjewadi police on February 1. According to the FIR, the suspects hid themselves on the service lane and pounced on her and as well as her friend late on the night of January 31. The four men attempted to kidnap them but she managed to flee the spot. A few minutes later, her friend managed to free himself.
 
 During the course of investigation, the Hinjewadi police nabbed four suspects but they were released on bail later.
 
 In the earlier complaint lodged with the Shivajinagar police, the woman officer had stated that two men had followed her to the Shivajinagar Police Colony and one of them caught hold of her hand and quarrelled with her. 
 
 An officer with the Shivajinagar police said the woman officer had also lodged a complaint of cheating against some unknown persons six months ago. The complaint was in relation to unauthorised withdrawal of money from her bank account.
