AHMEDABAD: Imtiyaz Qureshi (44) lost his house and workplace, in the form of a small printing unit, during the   in the   locality, one of the worst affect areas of the city. Forced to live in the relief camp at Shah-e-Alam for six months, he had no clue how he would get his life back on track.

  After the camp closed, Qureshi did not get a house in the colonies build for the riot affected. For a couple of years, he managed to put up at one of the worst rehabilitation colonies –  , near the Pirana garbage dump. He ran a pan parlour for two years in the newly inhabited colonies near Chandola. But his skills in printing got him a job again.
 
 Fifteen years after he lost everything, Qureshi considers himself lucky for having found a benefactor and a business partner in a Hindu. In 2007, he met  , who ran a photocopy centre off Relief Road, where Qureshi was working in a printing unit.
 
 Raghuvanshi relied on Qureshi for his printing skills and perseverance. “I wanted to expand my business by adding the facility to print flex banners and for this, I was looking for a reliable person. Imtiyaz has proved the perfect choice for me,” Raghuvanshi said, adding that he took considerable time before zeroing in on Qureshi.
 
 Raghuvanshi also said, “There were people who would advise me not to rely on a Muslim for my  . I don’t hold such biases. I have always partnered with Muslims for business.”
 
 Qureshi has furthered Raghuvanshi’s business. More than a dozen people work under him now. He left the remote rehabilitation colony and bought a house in the walled city. “I can say that my bad times ended after I started business with Mahendrabhai. It was not possible to rise on the relief provided by NGOs and government. I haven’t seen anybody doing anything meaningful with that aid,” he told TOI.
 
 Qureshi takes special pride in being able to educate his children, “My son and daughter both go to college. They study science.”
