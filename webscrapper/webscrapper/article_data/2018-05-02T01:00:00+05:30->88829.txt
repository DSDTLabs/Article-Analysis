 Director   made a long wish of his own come true on Sunday when he travelled in a train in India after 30 years. The 'Ra.One' director travelled from Lucknow to Varanasi in the  , and although the train was late by ten hours, Sinha says, he felt like a kid again excited about the train journey. "Our train was supposed to depart at 2 PM but kept getting delayed. We had puri-sabzi packed to have on the train, as I used to when my family would make train journeys when I was a kid," says the director.

 But to his dismay, his train got delayed by more than seven hours! "I had to take some stock shots for ' ' in Varanasi in the early morning but we had to change our plans as the train got delayed. We did think of travelling by road but after 24-days of non-stop shoot in Lucknow, my team and I wanted to take it easy and relax in the train and also experience a rail yatra."
 And so Sinha stuck to his original plan and waited for the train to arrive at the  . "I boarded a train after roughly 30 years and had a lot of expectation from what I used to read in the papers and hear on the news of the   having upped their facilities.

When ours did arrive after seven hours, it was filthy with no one to clean it," says he, adding, "Nothing, I repeat nothing has changed. The trains run late and no one seems answerable. Of course there’s an inconvenience regretted announcement on the PA system at the station, which I suspect hasn’t been re-dubbed in 30 years or so. People have come to accept that this is how it is in the Indian Railways and they have come to understand that they can get away with it as long as there are entertaining and thrilling stories in the headlines and no one will ask the right questions."
