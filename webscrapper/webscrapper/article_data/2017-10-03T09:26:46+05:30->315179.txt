Canadian PM  's newest political rival is a charismatic Sikh politician who rocks bright turbans, is social media savvy and a vocal champion of the rights of people of colour and the LGBT community.

 Jagmeet Singh, the 38-year-old son of Punjabi immigrants, became the first non-white leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party of Canada. Soon after getting elected with 53.6% of the votes on Sunday, Singh tweeted that he was launching his campaign to become the next prime minister of Canada. The next federal election in   is set for October 2019. 
 
 As a brown guy with a strange name and headgear, Singh has had his brushes with racism. He's often spoken about how he's been stopped for random police checks which motivated him to push for a ban on this police tactic. He told TOI in an interview that such experiences had given him a greater sensitivity to issues of unfairness and injustice. "This sensitivity has shaped my politics by developing a strong desire to challenge injustice and work towards creating a more equitable society," said Singh, a lawyer by profession.
 
 He's also been a strong advocate of a religious exemption for Sikhs from motorcycle helmet laws. This is not surprising, since turbans are his way of celebrating his Sikh identity. "I hope that by celebrating my identity, it encourages others to celebrate their own," said Singh, whose signature style - teaming colourful turbans with bespoke suits - has got him to the pages of fashion magazines like GQ.
 
 But sartorial savvy isn't the only reason Singh makes headlines. The trained MMA fighter doesn't pull his punches when it comes to criticising  's travel ban or speaking out against India's treatment of minorities. In 2013, he was denied a visa to visit India but he still hopes to be back, perhaps as Canada's first brown PM.
