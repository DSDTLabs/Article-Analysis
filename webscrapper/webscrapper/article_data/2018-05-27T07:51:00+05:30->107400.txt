LUDHIANA: As fire engulfed a water-cum-amusement park in   on Friday, hours after more than 250 school students had left the place, the fire department found that the park did not have fire-fighting equipment to control the deadly blaze. The department has now asked the park owner to come to their office and explain the lack of proper entry into the park and fire-fighting equipment.

 Giving details, fire officer   said he had asked the park owner,  , to come to his office and explain why there was no adequate fire-fighting system in place at the park. He added that there was no proper entry for fire tenders to get inside the park, which is necessary for such a system. “The   (if any) for the park was not given during my tenure, so we will have to check whether they have it. It is important for such parks to have an NOC from the fire department,” said the fire officer. He added that their team faced a problem in dousing the flames, as there was no proper entry into the park, and they had to park their vehicles in the neighbouring godown.
 
 The fire officer said before the fire incident, students of a school in   had visited the park, and were lucky to return before fire engulfed the park. He added that six members of the team were engaged in the fire-fighting operation, and they had brought four fire tenders — two from Khanna, and one each from   and Gobindgarh — for the operation.
 
 Fire department officials said their main worry was that thousands of tonnes of rice polish was stored in a godown near the site of fire. Rice polish is an inflammable substance, and if that had caught fire, it would created havoc. They added that about 60-70% of the park infrastructure was destroyed in the fire, the cause of which is being ascertained.
 
 The fire officer said no one was trapped inside the park at the time of the incident, and the chowkidar fled from the spot. He added that there was fire in a field nearby, which spread to the park.
