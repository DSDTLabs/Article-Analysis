NASHIK: The   ( ) needs to build as many as 273   in a span of 10 days to complete its target of 6,546 toilets under the  .

 The deadline was supposed to be met by end of December last year, but the civic body got an extension till January 15. The target was also brought down from 7,264 to 6,546 toilets for the first phase.
 
 The NMC had earlier set a deadline for itself to complete construction of toilets under Swachh Bharat Mission by August. Later, it extended the deadline by two months owing to floods that slowed down the work. Again, the deadline was extended from October to December.
 
 “The state government extended the deadline to January 15. We revised our target from 7,264 to 6,546 as some people had returned the money they were given for constructing the toilets. We had sent a letter government in this regard,” said an NMC official.
 
 He said meeting the target in 10 days was a difficult task, but not impossible and the pace of construction has been increased.
 
 “Despite starting the open defecation free (ODF) project quite late as compared to other cities due to the Kumbh Mela, we are doing pretty well. Many toilets come with removable parts which can be just assembled together. So, we will not require much time,” the officer said.
 
 Prime Minister   had announced Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in October 2014 which included construction of toilets to put an end to manual scavenging and open defecation.
 
 A survey was conducted in September 2015 by the health department of the NMC that found 7,174 families in the city defecating in the open. The number later increased in the consequent surveys. But gradually from 7,264 the number of toilets was revised to 6,546.
 
 The toilets have to be constructed by 2019 when the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan concludes. Cost of each toilet has been fixed at Rs 12,000. Out of Rs 12,000, the centre is contributing Rs 4,000 and the state is providing the remaining Rs 8,000.
