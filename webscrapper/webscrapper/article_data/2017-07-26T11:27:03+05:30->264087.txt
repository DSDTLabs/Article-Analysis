PUNE: Miscreants poured   on a safe in the office of a private school at Phursungi in the early hours of Saturday. 

 They managed to break it open and flee with Rs 6,000. A case was registered by the Hadapsar police in this regard.
 
 The chairman of Sonai English Medium School, A L Narsinharao, told TOI, “The safe that was damaged was brand new. It was purchased a week ago. The suspects also stole the CCTV cameras installed in the office.” Narsinharao, who also owns a construction company, said, “The school and the construction company offices are in the same room.”
 
 The chairman added that on Sunday morning, when he entered the office, he found the door locks to be broken. “I was shocked. The safe was damaged and the cash that I had kept in it was missing,” he said.
 
 According to Narsinharao, the suspects initially tried to open the locks of the safe by force. “When they failed, they took the acid that was in the office and poured it on the safe. As a result, the safe melted,” he said.
 
 The miscreants also stole CCTV cameras installed in the office. “We have cameras outside the office as well. The suspects tried to steal those too. Image of the fingers of one of the suspects, who attempted to remove the camera, has been captured,” he added.
 
 An officer from the Hadapsar police claimed that a search operation has been launched to trace the suspects.
