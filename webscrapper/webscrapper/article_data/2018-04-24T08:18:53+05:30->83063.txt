PANAJI: Senior counsel Harish   has told the Goa government that it has “no chances” of getting a favourable verdict if it files a review petition in the   case. Sources said that a decision on the next course of action will be taken over the next two days. 

 
 
  
 
 The Supreme Court, in its February 7 order, quashed the renewal of 88 mining leases and stopped mining operations from March 16. 
 
 A senior government official said that Salve’s opinion has been electronically communicated to chief minister manohar  . 
 
 Town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai, who is part of the Cabinet Advisory Committee ( ) to run the state’s affairs in Parrikar’s absence, said that Salve reasoned that “financial displacement can’t be a ground to challenge the order on the part of the State.” Sardesai said the advice will be debated at the state government level. 
 
 The issue will figure in the agenda of the CAC during its next meet.
 
 In March, the state government had sent a draft to Salve seeking his opinion on the review petition. 
 
 The draft, approved by the CAC, included the history of Goa’s mining industry, various court decisions concerning the industry, details about how economic activities will be affected, etc.
 
  “The draft has been sent to Salve for his opinion and then his opinion will be forwarded to the attorney general of India to decide on the course of action,” urban development minister Francis D’ Souza had said. Sardesai had said that Salve agreed to give his advice free of cost. 
 
 The GMOEA, however, has already declared its intension of filing a review petition. Its lawyers have opined that there are grounds to file a curative petition, but “there are certain difficulties”, according to an official.
