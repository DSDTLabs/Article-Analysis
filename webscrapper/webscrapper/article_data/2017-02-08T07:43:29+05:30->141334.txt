BENGALURU: Water storage at the   (KRS) reservoir in Mandya, a major source of piped drinking water for Bengaluru, is hitting a new low every day due to drought conditions and faster evaporation. For those worried about whether the same would result in disruption of water supply, the   ( ) has said that there’s no need to worry till April.

 Kemparamaiah, engineer-in-chief, BWSSB, said the city can manage with the available water at KRS till April. 
 
 “As of now, there are no plans of water rationing. Bengaluru city needs 1,400 million litres of Cauvery water every day, and right now we are getting 1250 MLD, which is manageable. A team of officials from BWSSB and Cauvery Neeravari Nigam Limited has done an inspection of the water level on Monday. We need a total of 3 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) of water to survive till April, and the dam has about 4.5 tmcft of water,” he added.
 
  further said that even in April they’ll have the option of lifting water from dead storage, but that decision has to be taken cautiously keeping in mind the needs of locals and others dependent on it. “The dam safety also needs to be kept in mind. Since the constitution of the water board in 1964, we have not lifted water from dead storage. We are hoping that a good and early monsoon will save us this time as well,” he added.
 
 Sources in the BWSSB, however, said that starting March the water board might resort to water rationing. “The present system of supplying water every alternate day may be revised to water supply every three days or once a week. Water at the KRS isn’t for to Bengaluru city alone. Drinking water needs of Mysuru and Mandya too need to be addressed,” said an official on condition of anonymity.
