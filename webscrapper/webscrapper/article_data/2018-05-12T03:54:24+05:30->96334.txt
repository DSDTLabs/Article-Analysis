MUMBAI: Three months after a good   rushed a bleeding railway accident victim to a hospital in   and was berated by a GRP personnel for not informing securitymen on duty, the GRP has completed an internal inquiry and taken action against the personnel. 

 The GRP administration stated in its letter that the action was taken after TOI highlighted the issue on its front page.   (26), a management graduate, had found a commuter lying on the tracks on Charni Road's platform 2 on the night of February 10. He was severely bleeding but was still breathing. Nobody was coming forward to help. So Tewari blocked the path of a train that had halted on the platform. He refused to move until the victim was lifted out of the tracks. There were no securitymen visible. Finally, a couple of commuters agreed to help and the victim was taken to   outside the railway station at 10pm. Tewari went through the victim's cellphone and found out his name was Ashwin Sawant. He informed Sawant's family. Tewari stated that he waited for an hour when a cop arrived. The cop wanted to know why the commuters had touched the victim, not waited for securitymen nor informed them. A showdown occurred which was captured by an onlooker on his cellphone. After Tewari uploaded the video on social media it was viewed by 1.5 lakh people and shared by 2,600. 
 
 The formal letter, handed to Tewari this week, was signed by ACP Sudhir Jambhavdekar. It stated that action had been taken against constable   from the Churchgate GRP outpost.
