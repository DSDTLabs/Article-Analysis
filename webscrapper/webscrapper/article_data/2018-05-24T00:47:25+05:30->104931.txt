Trichy: Before you dump garbage or any kind of waste on the road next time, think again. The urban local body (ULB) here on Wednesday launched an exclusive vehicle named “mobile spot fine vehicle” with an officer on board to levy penalties for more than 12 offences violating Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016.

 The move comes a year after ULB launched source segregation with an objective to reuse and recycle the waste categorised as biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The ULB had in June last year launched an extensive door-to-door waste collection process insisting on residents to segregate waste at source. Gradually, the corporation covered almost 80% of the 65 wards in the city under door-to-door waste collection. This was achieved through 140 mini load carriers and by establishing micro compost centres for decentralised waste disposal and recycling. 
 
 “Still, a section of people and shops had been allegedly dumping their waste on vacant plots, and commercial establishments failed to put up two bins to enable waste segregation. Such inconsistencies will be corrected through penalisation,” N Ravichandran, corporation commissioner said. Official sources said that even corporation workers found handling the waste in an unsafe manner would be punished by the spot fine vehicle. The corporation claimed that the public including residents and commercial establishments at a few identified spots including Karumandapam have been non-cooperative to the waste management rules. 
 
 “The vehicle will have a sanitary officer on board to inspect all four zones for levying penalties ranging from Rs 5 to Rs 5,000,” the commissioner added. Residents Welfare Associations (RWA) were roped in during the launch of spot fine vehicle to garner their support in keeping the streets clean and to improve the patronage for door-to-door waste collection.
