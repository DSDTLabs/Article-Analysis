CHENNAI: Too many ‘half-baked’   petitions on a range of issues, on which it had no expertise, have landed a Madurai-based organisation - Tamil Nadu Center for   - in a soup, as the Madras high court has held that PILs filed in its name will not be entertained.

 The first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar, criticising the forum for rushing to court with popular issues found in daily newspapers, said: “The name under which this organisation is being run creates a wrong impression in the public as if the organisation is a specialist only in filing PILs. An organisation doing voluntary work and having expertise in a particular field may approach the court. We cannot allow an organisation to pick up the morning newspaper, find out what is the issue raised and file   petitions without any knowledge of the subject or law, that too without any research on the subject. We are thus of the view that any petition which is filed in the name of the Tamil Nadu Centre for Public Interest Litigation cannot be maintained and no such petition shall be maintained in this name and style.”
 
 The bench passed the order while dismissing a PIL filed by K K Ramesh, managing trustee of the organisation, for a direction to the government to enact a special law to conduct jallikkattu with strict conditions.
 
 “The lack of expertise on the part of the petitioner is apparent from the fact that he seeks a direction to enact a special law. It is the sole prerogative of the government to enact law,” the bench said.
 
 Citing various verdicts of the  , it said mandamus could be issued only in a case where there is a statutory duty imposed upon a person, and there is a failure to discharge that statutory duty. “This court is not empowered to issue such a direction as is sought by the petitioner and it is for the government and the legislature to take a call on the issue,” it said.
