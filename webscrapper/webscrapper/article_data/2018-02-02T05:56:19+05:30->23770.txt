CUTTACK/KOLKATA: The Orissa High Court on Thursday granted bail to Trinamool Congress MP Tapas  , 13 months after he was arrested by the   in connection with his alleged involvement in the Rs 17,000-crore   ponzi scam.

 The bench of Justice J P Das asked Paul — two-time MP from Krishnagar, Nadia — to deposit a sum of Rs 1 crore as surety in the Bhubaneswar court of CBI special judge to avail the bail. The court has directed him to furnish two bail bonds of Rs 2 lakh each. Also, he has been asked to deposit his passport with the CBI court and cooperate with the investigating agencies.
 
 
 Paul was arrested by the CBI in December 2016 in connection with his involvement with the Rose Valley. The agency alleged that he was in the board of directors of at least two Rose Valley firms and received remuneration even when he was an MP. They also alleged that being an MP, he had written to former President  , seeking a probe against three ponzi firms, but was silent on Rose Valley.
 
 “The hearing was concluded in last December and CBI had filed a chargesheet. The CBI has got no new material in connection with the case. He has been detained for long,” said Paul’s lawyer, Siddartha Das. “He will abide by all of the conditions laid by the court. As soon as we get certified copy of the court’s order, we will complete the necessary paper work,” he added.
 
 The CBI on Thursday said the window to oppose the bail was still open and they would decide on that soon.
 
 Paul’s health has been a cause of concern for the correctional home authorities. Suffering from multiple ailments, he had to be shifted to private hospitals from   correctional home several times. He had to be admitted to hospital on the day he was sent to jail. Since then, his health parameters have been fluctuating. “He is quite ill and needs constant monitoring by doctors. Right now, he is at the jail hospital,” Das said.
