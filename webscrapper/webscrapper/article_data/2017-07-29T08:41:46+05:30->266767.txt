GALLE:   enjoyed another good day in Test cricket when he took three wickets to put India on top in the ongoing first Test against Sri Lanka here, but the left-arm spinner seems to have irked a few local fans with his antics at the Galle International Stadium.

 
  
 The Sri Lankan supporters are slightly upset after a You-tube video, which has gone viral, shows Jadeja imitating the bowling action of either off-spinner   or part-time offie  , near the Indian dressing room. While Jadeja's action left everyone in the Indian camp in splits, the Lankan fans, already frustrated with their team's pathetic show in the Test here, haven't found it all that funny, with many venting their ire on twitter against the India all-rounder.
 
 A Cricket Sri Lanka (SLC) official said that they hadn't lodged any complaint about the incident with the Indian team so far, but he didn't rule out any such eventuality in the near future.
