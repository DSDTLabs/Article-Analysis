Handspun and handwoven textiles like chic linens, earthy khaddars, raw silks and breathable cottons are back in vogue. You can give your traditional outfits like anarkalis, saris and kurtis a modern twist. Here’s how...

 
 
 Flowy anarkalis, stylish dhotis, linen shararas in fusion silhouettes always look attractive and can be sported by all ages with élan. 
 
 
 
 Choose traditional but go the contemporary way. Pick designs that have vintage, old-worldly elements in a modern garment. Keep your accessories to a minimum to avoid the OTT look.
 
 
  
 Intricate embroideries and re-invented traditional embellishments, use of dyeing and printing techniques on handlooms make these clothes a favourite with stylish young women.
 
 
 
 To get this look right, you could choose Western wear basics, and then blend them into an ethnic-inspired look. Pick flowy silhouettes like palazzos and a long top. 
 
 
 
 The timeless beauty and understated elegance of the sari is enhanced manifold when made in hand-spun, breathable, indigenous fabrics. The natural dyes used in sheer textiles like   doria stand out and add to the look. 
 
 
 
 Opt for unconventional blouses if you want to make a statement — choose a   collared full-sleeved one, flare-sleeved cropped top or even just a bralette!
 
 
 
 Layers, floor-length jackets over shorts or skirts, floral long shirts, embroidered bags and hand-spun scarfs are great if you want to make a statement at that casual brunch or a get-together. Do up the look with one sensational statement accessory.
 
 
 
 
 Fusion wear can be a tad tricky if you are not confident about what you are putting together. Layering is a key element in this look. You could also play with lengths — a long kurta with a skirt or culottes with a knee-length top. Experts say that avoiding large print-on-print is a good idea.
