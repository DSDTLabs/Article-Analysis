VIJAYAWADA: Andhra Pradesh   Association said they are not afraid of notices issued by the health department and they will continue their peaceful protest till the state government takes a decision on common   age.

  and Family Welfare on Tuesday warned the government doctors across the state to not trouble poor patients in   in the name of the strike. The district medical and health officers (DM&HO) of the 13 districts issued notices to medicals officers and DDO to not participate in protests and stated that strict action will be necessitated against the agitators as per   rules.
 
 Andhra Pradesh Government Doctors Association (APGDA) condemned the instructions passed on by the director of health and alleged that government is intentionally troubling them. “It was almost three years that we are agitating for common retirement age. Many PG doctors with less service than MBBS doctors are getting promotions because of their service and this is nothing but injustice,” said Dr N Bharat Rao, president of APGDA.
 
 APGDA state secretary general P Shyam Sundar condemned the notices given by the health department and questioned why a peaceful protest which is not obstructing work is causing such a stir. “We have all the right to stage protests opposing injustice happened to us. Around 4,000 doctors are facing problems with differences in retirement age and around 500 MBBS doctors retired without getting promoted,” said Shyam Sundar.
 
 “We are not afraid of disciplinary actions or notices given to threaten us. We will continue our protests till government increases the retirement age of MBBS doctors,” he added.
