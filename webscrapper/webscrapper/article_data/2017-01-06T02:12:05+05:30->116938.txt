Gurgaon:   admissions in most private schools in Gurgaon started last August but in some schools, they are still on.   say this happens because there is no regulatory body to control school admissions in the city, unlike in Delhi. Besides, schools follow different policies for the refund of booking amount and many schools don’t provide a break-up of the fee.

 “It’s a big problem in Gurgaon,” said Sakshi Chopra, a parent. “Schools do not have a uniform calendar of admissions and then there is the problem of refunding the fees. Once you block a seat in a school, there is no getting out of it. The refund policy varies from school to school. Some will not refund if the period of 30 days exceeds. Some schools have a policy of 30% refund within the 15-day period and so on,” she said.
 
 “In the absence of a regulatory body, it’s the parents who suffer. For the sake of better education of wards, we eventually get ready to pay through our nose,” she added.
 
 The admission fee charged by CBSE schools in Gurgaon is much higher than what is charged by Delhi schools. Most CBSE schools in Delhi, for instance, charge anything between Rs 1.1 and Rs 1.8 lakh per annum.
 
 Sumit Vohra, founder of AdmissionNursery.com, said the nursery admission process in Gurgaon schools spans as long as five months, which is unlike in Delhi where it happens at a particular time under directions from the directorate of school education. “Different schools have different admission dates in the city. It creates a lot of problems for the parents who want to weigh the options to select the best one for them,” he said.
 
 Gurgaon school principals, however, said they have a common body that takes care of all these issues. “We have Gurgaon Preparatory Schools Organisation. We all sit down together. A consensus is reached before we decide on the admission process and other related criteria. There has never been any inconvenience felt on the part of parents,” said  , principal of Amity World School.
