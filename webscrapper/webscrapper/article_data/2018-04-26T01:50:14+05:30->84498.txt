NEW DELHI: Many students, who appeared for the Class XII   re-test on Wednesday, found it far trickier than the earlier test, they did not leave the exam hall disappointed. While scoring high in the re-test might not be possible for all, students said they were happy to finally be free to concentrate on preparation for entrance tests and admission process.

 According to Akanksha Gosain,   economics teacher with Bal Bhavan Public School in Mayur Vihar, the re-test was a good idea and the   was much better than the previous one. “It was a better paper, though the difficulty levels were the same as the last one. The last one had a few tricky questions, as did this. But the students came out very happy,” she told TOI.
 
 Most students, however, felt the paper this time was tad bit trickier, especially because of the macro-economics questions. “The macro-economics part was difficult. I had to spend some time in searching for the answers. The questions were not as direct as the last paper,” said Yogesh Bhadauria, Bal Bhavan Public School.
 
 Gosain said the difficulty levels would vary for students, especially for those who kept up the preparation and those who took to the books just in the last few days leading to the re-test. 
 
 However, for some kids, the change in difficulty level also put a dent in their confidence for a high score. Wazir Hasan of Father Angel Public School felt this paper might pull down his score, as compared to what was expected in the last exam. “There were many questions in the last section of set-2 which took my time. If I would have scored about 70-80 in the last paper, this time I’ll be lucky to score about 70,” he said.
