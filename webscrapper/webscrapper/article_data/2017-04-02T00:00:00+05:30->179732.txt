Late director Diphan seemingly wanted to make Jayaram-starrer Sathya an out-and-out entertainer. 

 The movie apparently has three special dance numbers, according to a source from the team. One of them, Chinthicho Nee, is sung by   and has   doing a special dance number.
 
  “It’s the first time both Vaikom Vijayalakshmi and Roma are associating with such a dance number. It’s a fast track that has been filmed aesthetically,” says the source. Roma plays a dancer named Rosy and had earlier told us that she attempted something new for the movie.
 
  The actress says, “The character that I play in the movie is very different from anything I have done before. And the song is very much part of the storyline and relevant to my character Rosy. It was challenging to attempt something like that. So, I am looking forward to see how it has turned out.”
 The film also has two more special dance numbers. “All the songs are part of the film’s narrative and are shown during the journey of Jayaram’s character Sathya,” says the source. “Jayaram plays a Fort Kochi native who is settled in Pondicherry. A certain incident takes him on a journey and that’s what the film is all about.”
 
 The road movie, scripted by AK Sajan, also has Parvathy Nambiar, Aju Varghese and Sudheer Karamana in supporting roles.
