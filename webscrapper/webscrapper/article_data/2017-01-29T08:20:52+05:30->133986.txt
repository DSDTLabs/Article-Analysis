BENGALURU:  , leader of opposition in legislative council, appears to have won the first round against   state unit president   in the truce pact worked out by national president Amit Shah in New Delhi on Friday. 

 Eshwarappa's two demands: A relook into the party functionaries appointed by Yeddyurappa, and validation of   as the mascot to consolidate OBCs has been virtually accepted by the central leadership. Eshwarappa's presence at the Sangaolli Rayanna Brigade's convention at Kudala Sangama in Bagalkot district, defying Yedyurappa's warning, was the first pointer that no disciplinary action would be taken against him.
 
 Sources told STOI that the central leadership had realized that the party cannot be banking on Lingayat votes alone to fulfil its mission to bag 150 seats in the 2018 assembly polls. The party's victory in the 2008 assembly polls was, to a certain extent, attributed to votes coming from backward classes and scheduled castes and tribes, which otherwise usually went to the   and the JD(S).
 
 However, sources said both the leaders were warned by Shah to fall in line and work to strengthen the party cadres, who have been caught in the crossfire.
 
  Confusion prevailed among party workers despite the fact that Yeddyurappa had majority of the legislators and MPs supporting him, with only a handful of former legislators and partymen backing Eshwarappa. 
 
 Yeddyurappa and Eshwarappa, who returned to Bengaluru together on Saturday, presented a picture of unity. Speaking to the media here, Yeddyurappa said Eshwarappa has been given the overall responsibility of consolidating OBCs in the state, while B J Puttaswamy will continue as the BJP's state backward-classes-wing president.
 
 Also, Eshwarappa will hold the party's events under the aegis of Sangolli Rayanna. Yeddyurappa said there was also discussion on taking a relook at some of the district unit presidents and office bearers who were appointed last year.
