DEHRADUN: The   in the state who had high hopes from the   government are   let down because of the recent  . The order which was issued on May 16 states that the teachers who have worked for a minimum period of 6 months will get a weightage of 3% and those who have worked for more than a year will get weightage of 5% when they apply for temporary teaching jobs.
 
  The 6,214 guest teachers have remained unemployed since March 2017 when their contracts expired and have staged multiple agitations to get clarity on their employment status.
  
   , vice-president of the guest teachers’ association told TOI, “We were hopeful that the promises made by the ministers would be fulfilled but feel disappointed with the latest government order. The weightage is negligible and it is just for application of a contractual job. Also, the order states that we would be given a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 but no provision has been made for any leaves so if we take a leave then Rs 500 will be deducted from our salaries. This order does not improve our employment status in any way.”
  
  He said that if the government does not cancel this order and issue a fresh one with better provisions, then the guest teachers would be forced to go on the agitation mode from May 20.
