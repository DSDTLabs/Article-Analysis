Surat: As youth celebrated Valentine’s Day on Wednesday, some medicos in the city observed the ‘International Congenital Heart Defect (CHD) Awareness Day’ to raise awareness on one of the most common birth defects. Nearly 700 children are born with CHD every year in Surat.  According to medical estimates, 10 children per 1,000 born suffer from some sort of CHD during the fetus stage. In Gujarat, 13,000 children are born with heart defects every year.  “It is congenital defect and can’t be prevented. However, it can be diagnosed after around 16-20 weeks of pregnancy by fetal echocardiography. If it is life threatening, the parents are given the choice to terminate pregnancy or get surgery done,” city-based paediatric cardiologist Dr Ritesh Sukhramwala said.  “If the deformity is minor patient is asked to continue. In India majority of cases are treated after birth and more than 80% patients live life without any problems,” Dr Sukhramwala added. According to him, 30-40% of post birth surgeries are conducted in first year of life and remaining by the time child is 3-4 years old. Majority of time after surgery, life is near normal.  “Unfortunately people don’t have much awareness of treatment and diagnosis of the ailment. More so, there is not enough infrastructure in city like Surat to ensure proper treatment to all the babies suffering from CHD,” said Dr Sukhramwala adding, “Against 2,500 new births with CHD, we are unable to treat nearly 1,500 in a year. We also need awareness on mass scale for diagnosing of fetus.”  It was in 2002 that Surat-based NGO National Institute for Women and Child Development launched Child Heart Care project. There were no paediatric cardiologists in Surat then and few cases were operated in few hospitals in the city. Till now, 16 free annual paediatric heart care camps are organized for children and work has started.
