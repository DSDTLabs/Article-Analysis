 Paul Wall's felony drug charges have been dropped due to a lack of evidence. 

 The star, real name Paul Slayton, and his pal  , aka  , were arrested by police in Houston, Texas back in December during a raid on a building in the city. 
 
 They were both booked for felony intent to distribute between four and 400 grams of the controlled substance Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and were each released on USD 20,000 bail. 
 
 A grand jury heard the case but panellists declared there was insufficient evidence to convict the pair, and allowed them to walk free.
