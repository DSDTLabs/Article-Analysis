 Ahmedabad: Sanghpriya Rahul, the president of the Bhartiya Bauddha Sangh (BBS), on Monday expressed his support for the Una victims’ efforts to build a Buddha temple at Una. The RSS-supported BBS plans to build Buddha vihars (temples) in 26 districts of the state.
 
 “I am happy the Una flogging victims did not convert to Christianity and Islam and preferred Buddhism, the religion Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar embraced. I will extend all possible support to them for the Buddha temple at Una. We will also build Buddha temples in 26 districts, starting from Bharuch on May 22,” said Rahul.
 
 On why he was against their conversion to Islam or Christianity which the Constitution permits, Rahul claimed, “They have to face discrimination in Christianity and Islam and Buddhism is the only religion where they can live a dignified life.”
 
 Rahul has openly backed the BJP and RSS and even circulated messages during the Gujarat assembly polls, asking community members to vote for the saffron party.
