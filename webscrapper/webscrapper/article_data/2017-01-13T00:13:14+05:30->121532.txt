Nagpur: A social worker from Akola moved the Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court praying for directives to MSEDCL for awarding work of meter reading and distribution of electricity bills to women’s self-help groups and women welfare associations.

 The division bench, on Thursday, issued notices to the state chief secretary and other respondents asking them to reply within two weeks. Principal secretary of state energy department, MSEDCL managing director in Mumbai, regional director in Nagpur, along with chief engineer and executive engineers in Akola, have been made other respondents in the case.
 
 Petitioner Santosh Ansane, through counsel Harnish Gadhia, demanded to implement a GR of August 17, 2002 where it was mandated to provide employment to unemployed youths in government works.
 
 He said MSEDCL itself admitted that its officers were “non-serious” in performing works like meter reading and distribution of bills to consumers. Hence, these jobs should be handed over to the women  .
