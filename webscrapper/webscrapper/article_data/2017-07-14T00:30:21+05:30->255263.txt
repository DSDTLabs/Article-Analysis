Panaji: The factionalism within the   ( ) is taking a toll on Goan volleyball with the split within the Goa Volleyball Association (GVA) now wide open.
 
  GVA president Irvin Soares, along with majority of the executive committee members, expelled former secretary Santosh   and vice-president Shyamsundar Tari early this month. The decision was taken at the extraordinary general body meeting in Ponda and approved by general body president Daniel Rodrigues.
  
  On Wednesday, expelled members Bandodkar and Tari claimed Soares himself has no right to continue as president, after being expelled by VFI president  . Interestingly, the expelled duo enjoy confidence of the VFI president, who is fighting a battle of his own with secretary Ram Avtar Singh for control of the sport at the national level.
  
  In Goa, though, it is Soares who continues to call the shots.
  
  According to an email from the   (GOA), they have acknowledged correspondence from Soares and noted the change in secretary – from Bandodkar to Raghuvir Shinde.
  
  “Kindly note that our (earlier) mail dated 5th July, 2017 to yourself (Santosh Bandodkar) stands cancel in lieu of above,” the GOA wrote to Bandodkar in a separate mail on Wednesday.
  
  Even at the national level, Soares continues to enjoy prominence. He has been appointed observer for Kerala State Volleyball Association elections later this month and was the VFI’s choice as their representative when elections were held in Pondicherry as well.
