NEW DELHI: Only because a   is open to   can’t be an argument for not criminalising an act, Delhi high court remarked on Monday, hearing arguments on PILs seeking to criminalise  .

 HC was responding to the argument made by the Centre and cited by the petitioners that if marital rape is treated as a criminal offence it could be misused.
 
 A bench of acting chief justice Gita Mittal and justice C   are hearing a batch of petitions filed by two organisations — RIT Foundation and All India Democratic Women's Association.
 
 The petitioners maintained that even though false complaints may be lodged, but such cases were rare if one goes by current data.
 
 However, possibility of false cases being lodged could destabilise the institution of marriage as well as become a tool to harass husbands cannot be considered as grounds by Centre to defend the status quo, petitioners submitted. 
 
 The court seemed to agree and said “Misuse cannot really be an argument on whether an act should be criminalised or not”.
 
 The civil society organisations said around 20 million married women in India were victims of marital rape every year. They also argued since the neighbouring nations Pakistan and Bhutan have criminalised marital rape and the Sri Lankan Cabinet has forwarded a proposal, India should follow suit. 
 
 HC is also hearing two intervention applications, one in support of pleas to make marital rape an offence and the other opposing it.
