VADODARA: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) have decided to bring in certain changes in the CA course curriculum. 

 Accordingly, the entrance level for the CA programme which is currently known as common proficiency test (CPT) will be now onwards called CA foundation course. 
 
 “Also, instead of 200 marks exam that the candidates had to appear in the foundation level, the candidates will now have to appear for 400 marks exams with each subject accounting for 100 marks,” said Sandeep Jain, chairman of the   (WIRC) of ICAI. 
 
 WIRC office-bearers were in the city on Saturday to attend a felicitation programme for the new office-bearers of the Baroda branch of WIRC. Jain added that new subjects have been added to the Integrated Professional Competence Course (IPCC) also known as CA intermediate. 
 
 “At the same time, the syllabus of CA finals has been broadened with the introduction of capital markets and open book,” he said. 
 
 He stressed that the role of CAs is increasing as government, society, law and policy makers putting more confidence on the professionals.
 
 “The Reserve Bank of India has recently issued a new circular whereby advances above Rs 5 crore will have to be audited by CAs. Also, new provisions regarding valuation in the Companies Act, insolvency among others, have increased the role that CAs play in ensuring financial health of the country,” he said. 
 
 When questioned about the growing public perception that CAs had offered advice to their clients on exchanging old currency notes for new ones during the demonetisation period, Jain termed it as “unfortunate” perception. 
 
 On the   scam, he said that the institute’s national body is already looking into all the aspects.
