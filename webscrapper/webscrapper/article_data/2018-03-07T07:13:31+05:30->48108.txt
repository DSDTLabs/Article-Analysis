PUNE: The civic body has warned of action against farmers’ markets held without necessary permissions on open plots in its possession.

 The   ( ) has given permission to weekly farmers’ markets at six designated plots and proposals for 38 more slots are under consideration.
 
 The administration said it has received information about farmers’ markets being held at several places across the city without permissions either from the PMC or the Maharashtra State Agriculture Marketing Board (MSAMB).
 
 MSAMB had introduced the concept of farmers’ markets in some major cities of the state to minimize the role of middlemen, ensure assured market price for the cultivators and provide fresh vegetables, fruits and other farm produce to people at their doorstep and at affordable prices. The concept was a success and replicated all over the city in the last couple of years.
 
 A PMC official said, “The administration has been working as the nodal agency with MSAMB to ensure functioning of the farmers’ markets. The general body had in December 2016 gave its nod to the weekly farmers’ market policy. Recently, it has been learnt from citizens and also from elected representatives that some farmers’ companies and groups are involved in organizing unauthorised markets.” 
 
 The official said, “We also learnt that these groups and companies are purchasing vegetables from wholesale markets and involving local traders to sell the produce under the banner of the farmers’ markets. Such attempts are illegal and violate the policy.” 
 
 PMC has asked its ward offices to keep a tab on the farmers’ markets.
