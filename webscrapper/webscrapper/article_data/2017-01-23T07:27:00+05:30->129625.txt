JALANDHAR: Even as police have stepped up security in Jalandhar due to the upcoming assembly elections, four members of a gang shot at and injured a rival gangster on the city’s Cool Road on Sunday morning.

 Pancham Noor Singh, an aide of slain gangster Sukha Kahlwan and who was released on bail a few weeks ago, was intercepted by the assailants, who came on two scooters, around 10 am. Pancham was in his car with another youth when the attack took place.
 
 Two bullets hit Pancham in his abdomen, two in his back, and one in his right arm. He was rushed to a private hospital, and was referred to a tertiary care centre in Ludhiana as his condition was stated to be serious. Though the attackers escaped, they were captured by CCTV cameras fitted near the crime spot.
 
 On the basis of a statement by Pancham’s friend  , police have registered a case of attempt to murder against gangster Gursharan Singh, alias Bhaalu. Jalandhar commissioner of police   said the crime was the fallout of an old rivalry and the accused would be nabbed soon. ACP (central)   said Bhaalu was wanted in over “half a dozen cases” and was a proclaimed offender. He said Pancham also faced three cases.
