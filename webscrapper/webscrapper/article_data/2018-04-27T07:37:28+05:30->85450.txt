NEW DELHI: Providing a preview of his   campaign due to begin next week, PM   launched a hard-hitting attack on  , saying it has hired foreign agencies — a not-so-indirect reference to the   controversy — to spread misinformation.

 
 Addressing BJP’s Karnataka candidates, Modi said the country’s politics cannot be “purified” until it is freed from Congress culture, whose “sins and misdeeds” are embedded in the political mainstream and said its move to recognise Lingayats as a separate religion is a fake promise.
 
 After a few lines in Kannada, Modi said he regretted not having learnt the language and spoke in Hindi, exhorting party workers to speak on a development-centric agenda, highlighting central allocations to the state, even while exposing the opponent’s caste-based strategies. He said predictions by some surveys of a hung assembly are a Congress ploy as people have made up their mind for change and BJP is headed for a majority.
 
 The prime minister said instead of development, Congress believes in divisive politics targeting a particular caste and community for electoral gains.
 
 “A concerted misinformation campaign has been launched against the Centre for which even foreign agencies have also been hired,” Modi said, referring to allegations that Congress had hired data mining firm Cambridge Analytica, accused of illegally accessing   user data.
