‘America Ammayi’, one of Telugu television’s most famous shows is all set to see a new   bloom. 

  The channel the show has aired on since 2015 posted an intriguing promo on their social media with the caption, “Another sweet love story! #AmericaAmmayi Stay tuned to know what's in store !!” (sic) However, while the show’s lead character   is seen in the promo, the lead actress   seems to be missing. A new actress and character seems to be in place, hinting at either a time-jump or a change in the present love track. 
 
  In the video, the female lead can be seen sipping on coffee while eyeing someone who looks like Surya or is Surya across the café. When she catches his attention, their conversation moves to texting each other from just eyeing each other from across the room. She implies that her hearts beats only for him, with him replying that without her he’d be pretty much dead. The promo ends with the actress laughing at this. 
 
  In the two hours since posting, the promo has numerous comments, 32 shares, more than 24k views and more than 500 likes. The comments under the promo speculate if the story will now revolve around a new generation, that of Surya and Samantha’s son or if the scene is something from Surya’s flash back. Some even wonder if the heroine is being changed and speculate further as to what it could be. 
 
  ‘America Ammayi’ is the story of Samantha/Sam, played by Marina Abraham and her love for Surya, played by Seethakanth. Samantha is an Anglo-Indian NRI from America brought up with Indian values and culture. She returns to India to convince her grandparents to accept her mother back into the fold after they had previously disowned her for marrying an American against their wishes. While there, she falls in love with Surya.
