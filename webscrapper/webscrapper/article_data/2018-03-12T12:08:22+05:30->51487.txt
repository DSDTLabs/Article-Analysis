MARGAO:   villagers on Sunday reiterated their demand for a permanent panchayat secretary for their coastal village panchayat as the public is being severely inconvenienced, besides various development works are being affected.

 Orlim deputy sarpanch   told TOI that Orlim villagers demanded for a permanent panchayat secretary. “The current secretary, Purshottam Alve, holds additional charge of Orlim panchayat besides Carmona. Today, there was a gram sabha conducted at both villages, but   requested the block development officer to depute Alve for this gram sabha as otherwise a different panchayat secretary, who is totally unaware of the issues that the village faces, attends the gram sabha,” said Martins.
 
 Sarpanch Tamica D’Silva said that the audit report and an approximate Rs 50 lakh budget proposal were approved by the gram sabha members. 
 
 “A resolution was also passed to install the statue of Goa’s first opposition leader Dr   (who led the ‘Opinion Poll’ movement) in the legislative assembly and his photo in the village panchayat,” the Orlim sarpanch told TOI.
