New Delhi: The first day of registration for   admissions on Tuesday turned out to be confusing for many aspirants and their   as they were unaware that most colleges would follow the fourth cutoff list. 

 Sapna Singh, a parent who accompanied her daughter to  , was also anxious about the ECA exemption being a matter of college discretion. “We are told that the exemption range is from 5% to 15% and it is completely under the discretion of a college. So naturally we are anxious if the relaxation will be adequate to secure a seat,” she said.
 
 Amrita Bajaj, deputy dean of students welfare at DU, said the colleges were allowed to make up to 15% exemption in the cutoff for a candidate if he failed to meet its cutoff. “For example, if a student applying under the creative writing category has scored 95% but the college cutoff in the fourth list is 98%, the college can admit him after making a 3% exemption,” she explained. A college can make up to 15% exemption for the ECA admissions if it is interested in an aspirant, she added. 
 
 She suggested that a student whose name has appeared in the ECA merit list must choose the courses of interest first, then the colleges that are offer those courses and have seats for the specific ECA activity, and finally match his best-of-four marks for the selected subjects with the latest cutoff list. 
 
 “In case the subject is otherwise closed for admissions, the college will compute the percentage on the basis of the cutoff at which the admission has closed. Otherwise, use the third cutoff list as reference,” said Bajaj. Since the cutoff in the fourth list is going to fall only marginally, the third list will act as an appropriate reference point to see which colleges match a candidate’s best of four, she added.
