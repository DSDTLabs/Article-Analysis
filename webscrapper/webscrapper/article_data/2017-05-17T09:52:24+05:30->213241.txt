AURANGABAD: While accidents on   continue unabated,   are moving at a snail’s pace to construct a   on the 10-km stretch.

 With no alternative route for heavy traffic, the road has been witnessing constant snarls near  , Jabinda Lawns,  , MIT college and Bajaj hospital. Bumper-to-bumper traffic is also haunting commuters during peak hours.
 
 The main worry for commuters, however, is the rising number of accidents on the road. Apart from several minor accidents, seven persons have died on the bypass in 2017.
 
 Measures initiated by the city police to control flow of heavy vehicles along the stretch have also failed to give encouraging results. Traffic police had banned heavy vehicle entry on the road in the morning and evening hours. Apart from this, city police chief Yashasvi Yadav recently deployed a speed gun and breathalysers to prevent accidents. Despite this, a woman was crushed to death in an accident at Devlai Chowk three days ago.
 
 Civic authorities, however, are showing no signs of constructing the much needed service road over the coming days. Though the civic administration has marked all affected properties in April, it is yet to start removing encroachments on the land meant for the service road.
 
 D M Mugalikar, civic commissioner on Tuesday told TOI that marking of all the properties has been completed. “We have served notices to all property owners asking them to vacate the space as soon as possible. But some of them have challenged it in the court and so we were forced to put the demolition drive on hold. In the meantime, the AMC will start demolishing other properties from June 1,” he said, adding that demolition to commercial category properties can be carried out in the monsoon.
