NEW DELHI: Seeing a political opening in the wake of Dalit unrest over Bhima-Koregaon,   has decided to launch this month a mass connect programme across Maharashtra to mobilise major communities against the ruling  . Sources said Congress chief   has cleared the plan for “Parivartan Yatras” in the sprawling state where the party has been relegated to the margins of power after its defeat in assembly elections in 2014. 

 The yatra will be launched from Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra covering key districts of Satara, Sangli and Pune, and then be taken to other regions. The extensive six-month programme touching all 288 assembly constituencies has been designed to tap into the “anger among key social blocs”.
 
 While Marathas took out massive “silent marches” across Maharashtra in 2017, Dalit protests have rocked the government in the new year, bringing Mumbai and many districts to a halt. 
 
 “From farmers’ suicides to Bhima-Koregaon incident, we will go to people on all issues. Till BJP is in power, Maharashtra cannot move forward. This government is responsible for the state’s situation over three and half years. Only Congress can take the state forward,” Maharashtra state unit chief Ashok Chavan told TOI. 
 
 Saying BJP tried to be “too clever by half ”, Chavan alleged the ruling party used Hindutva elements like Shambhaji Bhide and   to provoke attacks in Bhima-Koregaon to trigger religious polarization. In what has become a political euphemism for targeting chief minister Devendra Fadanavis, Chavan said the allround unrest under BJP rule was a reminder of the charge of Dalits in the battle of Bhima-Koregaon 200 years ago.
