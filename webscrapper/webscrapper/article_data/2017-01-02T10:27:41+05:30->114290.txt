JALANDHAR: The jathedars of the three   being advised against attending 350th birth anniversary celebrations of   at Patna Sahib, and the SGPC earlier asking them to stay away from religious functions of the martyrdom anniversary of younger sons of Guru Gobind Singh at Fatehgarh Sahib on December 27, are the first two instances when those controlling Sikh institutions have recognized the unpopularity of the present high priests.

 Sources in SGPC and SAD revealed that the Fatehgarh Sahib incident became an easy handle for Patna Sahib managing committee headed by   to put the SGPC and Punjab government in an embarrassing situation by saying no to the participation of the jathedars from Punjab. Sources said Makkar was unhappy with the way SAD's top brass had treated him in the past couple of years of his tenure as SGPC president. His replacement to Sikh mini-parliament's top post by Prof   added to his dissatisfacion. Makkar headed the SGPC when Sikh high priests took controversial decisions, including the pardon   chief Ram Rahim Singh, and were supported by SGPC.
 
 The SAD-controlled Punjab government responded to the opposition by beefing up security around the three jathedars. “It is for the first time that by making them to stay away from important functions and customs, the SGPC has admitted that they are unpopular,“ said SGPC former general secretary Sukhdev Singh Bhaur.“They acted as per the directions of the top SAD brass.SGPC was also made part of their folly by making the latter to issue advertisements in support of the pardon. “ When asked about the reason for non-participation of Akal Takht jathedar in the religious functions at Fatehgarh Sahib, SGPC general secretary Amarjit Singh Chawla said SGPC wanted to maintain amity among Sikhs. He refused to speak any further.
