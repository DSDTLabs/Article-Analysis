'  11' contestant   gave us a sneak peek of her new look on her social media account with a new haircut. Clicking the pictures against sunlight,   looked stunning with golden blonde hair. Sporting her hair length much shorter than she is seen in the recent past, Bandagi was seen with a messy look. 

 Bandagi said, "I wanted to do a different look, a style that I have never adorned before. I have always loved short fringes and took the bold decision to get it done. I think it was a good decision as everyone have been complimenting me for this new hairstyle! "
 
 Bandagi is currently in a relationship with  , her inmate from Bigg Boss. The duo admit they are in love but have not plans of marriage yet. Bandagi said, "Marriage is just a formality. We will do it when the time comes. Currently, I am enjoying this phase of knowing   and exploring the world outside with him. In the 'Bigg Boss' house I met him and fell in love but I was meeting him with other inmates. So there was a side to him I didn't know. Now, I am getting to know the real Puneesh which I am enjoying. We both love travelling and hopefully we will work together too."
