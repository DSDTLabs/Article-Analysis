Singer   says she is planning to take a break from work until the end of January. 
The "Can't Get You Out Of My Head" hitmaker, who is engaged to actor Joshua Sasse, said she just wants to relax and do nothing during the free time, reported Female First.
 
 "I am about to disappear for the whole of January ... I've made no plans at all. When I work, every minute of my life is planned out and I've been working nonstop for months, so my ultimate luxury is to make no plans at all. I might go abroad, I might stay at home. 
 
 "All I know is there is nothing in the diary for January. After everything I've been through, I've learnt to appreciate being happy in the moment. I'm good at doing nothing. I certainly hope (he'll be there). It wouldn't be much fun without him. Any chance we get to have time together we take it. We are still in the romantic stage," Minogue said. 
 
 The 48-year-old singer previously admitted she wants things to "settle down" in 2017.
