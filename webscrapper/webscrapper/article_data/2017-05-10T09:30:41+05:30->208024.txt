 The victim of this lawlessness stands guard on our borders, defending our country, and he and his family know very well he risks death in doing that.
 
 This is not how he deserves to be treated. Any delay in putting the culprits on trial and securing a conviction would send out a wrong signal.Lawlessness cannot be tolerated.
