PANAJI: Local mango produce this year is likely to increase by 10% compared to the previous year owing to favourable climatic conditions, but early fruition of the king of fruits may result in a shorter season. 

 “Produce has been steadily increasing.   have reported a very good crop with the produce having increased by 4-5% so far. The quantum of mangoes coming in from Bardez and   in particular is huge,” said agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode. 
 
 “We are optimistic that there will be a 10% increase in the overall produce. Last year the output stood at 5,958 tonnes,” he said. The reason for this has been attributed to climatic conditions that have proved favourable for the crop.
 
 Cool mornings and hot noons in January-February did cause a glitch in the flowering stage. However, warm climate in March gradually initiated a faster development of fruits. 
 
 On a downside, this early fruition may result in the season winding earlier this time, said Dr AR Desai of the ICAR-CCRI. 
 
 “Hastening of maturity time is not a routine phenomenon. Farmers, therefore, will have to harvest earlier than usual and the season will also end sooner,” he said.
 
 While the final batch of mancurad mangoes is in the harvest stage at orchards, other varieties like Payri, Sakrin and Mussarad are just entering the local market. Mangoes sourced from other states like Ratnagiri Alphono, Totapuri, Dussehri, etc, are also in the pipeline.
 
 “The season is ending for mancurad mangoes and their rates are therefore increasing again owing to lesser availability. Mango prices will soon normalize as other varieties from Goa as well as neighbouring states hit the market,” said fruit vendor Shafi Ahmed.
