SALEM: Saroja, a 43-year-old daily wage labourer from   near Omalur, was taken aback when she found actor Kajal Agarwal’s photo on the new PDS smartcard issued to her by the taluk supply office in Omalur.

 “I can’t get over the shock after seeing Kajal Agarwal’s photo in the smartcard,” Saroja told TOI. She wondered how the actor’s photo appeared in her smartcard.
 
 When contacted, an official from the district supply office in Salem district was not able to give an explanation. On condition of anonymity, he said, “The cardholder can approach the ‘e-seva’ centres at the collectorate and taluk headquarters and get a new smartcard with correct details at the earliest.”
 
 Not just the photograph, Saroja’s husband’s name was given Periyathambi instead of Periyasamy. Saroja, a resident of RC Cettipatty village in Komalivattam union, had applied for the smartcard through the PDS shop at Komalivattam and received it on September 11.
 
 She approached the PDS shop personnel to replace the card but they refused to take it back. When she approached officials at the taluk supply office in Omalur, she was driven from pillar to post. Finally the PDS shop personnel advised her to approach ‘e-seva’ centres to replace her photo in the card.
 
 Saroja is having trouble getting her PDS supply using the card. “Initially, the PDS shop salesman refused to give me items. When I started arguing with him, he agreed to provide supplies,” Saroja said. She said the whole issue shows the negligence of officials.
 
 Meanwhile, many villagers too claim their names, residential address and other details appeared wrong in the smartcards issued to them.
