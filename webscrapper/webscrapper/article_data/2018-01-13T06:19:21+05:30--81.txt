CHENNAI: With the   on Friday passing the bill to enact   Business Facilitation Act, 2018, the state has taken a right step in its quest to once again become the most preferred investment destination for industries in the country.

 The Act not only facilitates a single point receipt of applications for securing clearances that are required to establish or expand an enterprise, but also clearances required during normal course of business, including renewals in a time-bound manner. It will also provide for effective grievance redressal mechanism and impose fine in case of failure of competent authorities to act within a time limit. While lack of such facilitation had impacted Tamil Nadu on the 'ease of doing business' front in the recent past, the   (BRAP 2017) of the Union ministry of commerce and industry had mandated such a legislation by states, with October 31, 2017, as the deadline to comply with. Since the assembly was not in session, Tamil Nadu had opted for the ordinance route. Governor   cleared the ordinance on October 28.
 
 With Tamil Nadu having laid down an ambitious Vision 2023 plan to become India's most prosperous and progressive state, robust industrial development will be one of the major contributors for achieving that vision. Simplification of the regulatory framework and reducing and rationalising procedural requirements would pave the way for promotion of industrial development in the state, the government said while moving the bill in the state assembly.
 
 The industry in the state is more than happy to welcome the initiative. "It is a welcome change as far as the past experience of the industry in Tamil Nadu is concerned. Over the last one-and-a-half years, the government, through interactions with the industries, had addressed a lot of anomalies and now we get to know that several of our members have applied and are giving positive feedback," P Ravichandran, president,   told TOI.
