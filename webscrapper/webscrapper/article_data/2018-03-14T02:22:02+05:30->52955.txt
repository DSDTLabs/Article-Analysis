New Delhi: Questions related to   and numericals   Class XII students in their chemistry   on Tuesday. Some students also complained that the paper had several application-based questions that might make it difficult to score, though teachers said the paper was neither difficult nor easy, but largely from NCERT.

 According to The Indian School principal, Tania Joshi, some students did find the exam on the tougher side because of the number of application-based questions, but the paper was primarily satisfying. However, Ameeta Mulla Wattal of Springdales, Pusa Road said her students were very satisfied with paper.
 
 However, students said the   and organic/inorganic chemistry questions were a little difficult for them. “It is easy to pass the exam but it is hard to score above 65% as most questions were application-based. Organic chemistry and numerical questions were quite tricky to solve. At the same time, the paper was easy and not lengthy,” said Yashika Chough of Manav Rachna School in Faridabad.
 
 Her teacher, Rajni Bhandaula, agreed. “This time the paper was mainly concept-based. If a student had gone through the NCERT book thoroughly and practiced from sample papers and reference books, he or she would have faced no difficulty in solving the paper,” she said.
 
 Chirag Keshri, a student from Mount Abu Public School, said, “Some questions were a little twisted but could be solved.”
