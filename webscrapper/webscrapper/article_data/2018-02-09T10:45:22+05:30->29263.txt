Director Kamal's much-discussed film ' ,' inspired by the life of writer   aka Madhavikutty, has hit screens today. Here's what the film's like half way through it's length.

  plays the elder Kamala Das and Murali Gopi enacts her husband, Madhava Das, who is 20 years older to her. Tovino appears as her Imaginary lover, muse and Lord Krishna, who is a constant presence and inspiration in her life. Ranji Panikker acts as the magazine ediror who publishes her autobiography.
 
 The first half covers a lot of ground including her growing up years in Punnayurkulam, before the scene shifts to Mumbai and Kolkata as she trails her husband. The film does not have just a simple, linear narrative but one that captures her mental struggles and dilemmas. Songs and background music work well, but the same cant be said about the make up of Manju.
