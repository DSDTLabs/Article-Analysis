Gurgaon: Th Lokayukta has directed the director general of police (DGP) to file a reply in connection with power theft for over two years by the office of DCP (east), Gurgaon. 

 The top cop has been asked why the police department did not take measures to restore the connection, which was disconnected by the power department due to pending payments.
 
 The power connection to the office of the DCP (east), Gurgaon was disconnected by DLF sub-division officials for non-payment of electricity bills, with arrears amounting to Rs 3.93 lakh in April 2012. According to RTI activists Harinder Dhingra, thereafter, DCP office began drawing power illegally, straight from power lines, instead of through meters. 
 
 For 28 months, it continued using power illegally and used four air conditioners, 18 fans, seven coolers and 22 tubelights since January 2014.
 
 As per rough estimate, if such load is used for office/complex then the monthly bill would be no less than Rs 30,000. Therefore, power worth Rs 8 lakh, was withdrawn illegally, withoup paying for it. As per law, if any person of the public draws power illegally, he is booked under various provisions of the IPC & Electricity Act, but in case of DCP (east), Gurgaon, no cognisance of the illegality was taken either by DHBVN or the police department.
 
 Dhingra filed a petition before Lokayukta and sought action in the case on March 10. The DGP has now been asked to file his reply within 30 days, with the next hearing scheduled in July.
 
 Meanwhile, on Monday, a DHBVN vigilance team detected power theft at residences of three police constables posted at the recruitment training centre (RTC) near Bhondsi. The discom imposed fine of Rs 1.22 lakh on them and filed a complaint against the defaulters. The cops had electricity meters installed at their homes, but they were drawing power illegally at night, from a high voltage line passing by the houses, said an official.
