NEW DELHI: Ban production of non-ISI mark helmets, a government appointed panel has recommended. The committee has pushed for changing the design of motorcycle helmets to reduce the weight and make it less bulky without compromising the safety aspects.

 It has also recommended exploring special design of helmets for women riders which don’t spoil their hairstyle. The panel has suggested that each such helmet must bear the mark of “two-wheeler” in addition to the   mark with licence number to distinguish them from other helmets.
 
 At present, India follows the European standards for its motorcycle helmets and there has been little compliance of people wearing such protective headgear. Their bulky look minus any ventilation have been a key reason for motorcyclists to avoid wearing helmets despite the fact that not wearing them is the single major reason of high number of fatalities of motorcycle riders. According to  , motorists without helmet are 40% more likely to die from a head injury.
 
 Considering these factors the road transport ministry had set up an expert group with representatives from helmet manufacturers, automobile industry association (SIAM), doctors from   and the   ( ) with the mandate to suggest changes in the design that will make helmets more comfortable to wear and more affordable for all two-wheeler riders.
 
 The panel has recommended that the new helmet should cover only the forehead in the front and upper portion of the neck. At present, helmets cover the entire head, face, chin and neck, which make them uncomfortable to wear.
 
 Keeping in mind the dusty condition on Indian roads, the committee has recommended that visors should be fitted in every new helmet and government should notify the standards for both helmet and visors.
