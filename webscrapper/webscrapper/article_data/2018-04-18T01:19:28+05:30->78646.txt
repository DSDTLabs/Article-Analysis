NEW DELHI: An   has lost her dream of making a   after being   of   through   from her bank account in south Delhi’s  . The cheque series, through which the bank officials claim they transferred the money, are lying intact with 61-year-old Sukhjit Kaur.

 The victim’s parents passed away a year ago. Being an only child, she sold her parents’ house for Rs 2.5 crore. Since the last wish of her parents was to make an old-age home, Kaur decided to invest the entire amount in it. She kept the money in her bank at Jamia Nagar and took out the cash that she required for the venture a couple of times every month.
 
 Kaur told TOI that she last went to the bank in February and then on April 7. “I keep withdrawing cash to make payments for the old age home to ensure that it has all necessities. When I went to the bank and presented a cheque, I was told that my account didn’t have enough cash. I was shocked because the last time I checked my account, there were over Rs 60 lakh in it,” she said.
 
 “After being doubly sure that I had been cheated, I went to the bank manager and told him what had happened. He arrogantly asked me not to waste his time. When I emphasised that I didn’t withdraw the cash, he said that the amount was transferred to a bank account at Devli Road,” Kaur said.
 
 She claimed that she didn’t even get any notification regarding the deduction on her registered mobile number. The bank manager told her the amount was transferred using a cheque and told her the series. 
 
 Kaur said that she has those cheque series at home and never withdrew money using them.
 
 The elderly victim then approached police and an FIR for cheating was lodged on her complaint. A senior police officer said that a notice has been sent to the bank seeking clarification. “We suspect an insider’s involvement in the fraud,” said an officer.
