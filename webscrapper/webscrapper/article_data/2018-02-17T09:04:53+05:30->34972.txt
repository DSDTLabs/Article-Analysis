HYDERABAD: Threatening to boycott the upcoming board exams — SSC (Board of Secondary  ) and intermediate — private college managements, on Friday, demanded that the state ‘fix’ the fee, especially in intermediate and degree colleges.

 Apart from refusing to provide space in their institutions, to be used as exam centres, managements said they would boycott other exam duties as well, if government failed to honour their demands immediately.
 
 “We are aware that over 9 lakh students are set to write their intermediate examination from February 28. However, it is out of desperation that we have decided to withdraw our support to the government. Just like in engineering, they should fix the fee for intermediate colleges so that we can survive,” said  , chairman,   KG to PG educational institutions committee.
 
 The private institutions said that the government not only released the fee reimbursement amount very erratically, since formation of the state, but also failed to increase intermediate fee over the past four years or so.
 
 “There are hardly 1.8 lakh students in government colleges and the budget provided for them is Rs 450 crore. In comparison, there are nearly 4.5 lakh students in private institutions, for which we hardly get ?85 crore. How does the government expect us to provide quality education, complete with all facilities, for such a meagre fee,” asked  , convenor of the JAC adding that for some unknown reason, even the 10 per cent annual fee hike has not been implemented since the state formation.
 
 Further, with electricity bill and property tax on the rise, colleges claimed that they are unable to pay salaries to about five lakh staffers and urged the authorities to provide subsidy on these bills. They also asked the state to exempt them for procuring fire safety certificate and allow colleges, in operation for over 10 years, to withdraw their fixed deposit receipt amount.
