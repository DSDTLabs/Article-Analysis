MUMBAI:   of   High School in Malad (east) have initiated a signature campaign against the management’s ‘arbitrary’ decision to   fees by nearly 10% every year. 

 For students who are moving from pre-primary to class I, the jump in the fees is much higher, alleged the parents. They also claimed that despite charging high fees, the school has failed to provide them with facilities that were promised in the brochure six years ago.
 
 While the   structure for class I last year was around Rs 1.3 lakh, it has now been increased to Rs 1.49 lakh, said a parent, a 80% hike for moving from pre-primary (where the fee was Rs 83,000) to class I. 
 
 The decision to increase the fees was informed to the parents a few days ago, when they had already completed the re-enrolment process, said a parent of a class VI student. She alleged, “The school lacks a playground, lift and proper classrooms. Facilities such as swimming pool and an amphitheatre were promised when we took admissions six years ago. Raising fees every year by 10%, when the base is high is unfair.” Another parent added that the hike was informed to them at a time when it will be difficult for them to withdraw admission as most schools complete their process by now. 
 
 CEO of the school Ashish Tibdewal said the school had conducted an orientation programme where information about the fee structure was given, but many parents did not attend it. 
 
 “As for class I, the number of hours students put in is double than that in pre-primary. There are more teachers and more study material. Cost is bound to rise,” said Tibdewal. “It is only for the pre-primary classes to class I that the jump is higher. For the remaining classes it is an average of 9%. If our school charges abnormally high fees, parents will not come to us. Our class strength is much smaller than other schools, which have 50-60 students in each class,” he added.
