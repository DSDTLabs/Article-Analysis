LUDHIANA: A city-based RTI activist lodged a complaint with chief vigilance officer of local bodies department   against alleged illegal construction work on a large chunk of agricultural land in Isher Nagar.

 In his complaint, the activist Kuldeep   claimed that a developer has been constructing flats on this land.
 
 Khaira said that   can’t give any permission as this large chunk of land is adjoining a single passage which is an old water channel and is owned by the irrigation department.
 
 He alleged that it is not possible that anybody can carry out unauthorized construction of flats or any unauthorized colony without active connivance of MC officials.
 
 Khaira requested to take action against the MC officials under whose nose the “unauthorized flats” are being constructed and order them to demolish the same.
 
 MC commissioner   said that he has received the complaint and he has also asked the officials concerned to get it checked.
 
 Zonal commissioner of zone C   however said that they had got the construction work stopped earlier too and now they have recommended action against the developers. She said the MC commissioner will take decision over this issue.
