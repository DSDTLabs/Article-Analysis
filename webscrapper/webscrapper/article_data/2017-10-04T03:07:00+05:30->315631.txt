Panaji: The audit of major bridges along the national highways has indicated that the structures are stable and don’t require any major repairs, the   (PWD) has stated in its report to the government.

 Speaking to TOI, PWD principal engineer, Uttam   said that they have completed the stability and safety audit of bridges in the state in a phased manner. He also said that the audit report of major bridges like Mandovi, Zuari, Colvale, Borim, etc, have been completed and a report in this regard has been submitted to PWD minister Ramkrishna ‘Sudin’ Dhavalikar.
 
 “The audit of these bridges has found that there is no danger,” he said.
 
 Parsekar also said that the audit of the remaining bridges would be completed soon, and a report will be submitted to the government.
 
 Chief minister Manohar Parrikar had directed the PWD to conduct the stability and safety audit report of all old bridges, including those that are not in use, and submit its findings by June 30, 2017, along with measures for rehabilitation.
 
 The direction came following the collapse of a footbridge at Sanvordem in May earlier this year, where two persons lost their lives.
 
 PWD expressed confidence regarding the structural stability of bridges in the state, pointing out that the department conducts safety audits of all bridges twice a year. Elaborating on the safety checks, PWD officials said that the inspection is undertaken to check the deck slab levels, corrosion and other changes in the bridge conditions.
