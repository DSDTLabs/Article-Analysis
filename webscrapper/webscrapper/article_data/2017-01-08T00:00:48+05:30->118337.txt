  All disease begins in the gut”... that was wise man Hippocrates foretelling the fate of human existence aeons ago. Maybe not all, but most chronic metabolic diseases do cultivate in the gut. What one mustn’t ignore are telling signs — mental stress and anxiety,  ,   and frequent infections.
  
  
 
  It is not out of the blue that your body throws up odd reactions to food or bloats up every now and then. These are signs of a sluggish digestive system. The gut is like an entire ecosystem of bacteria and yeast — some beneficial to you, others toxic. One needs to make sure to eat and exercise well to entertain the good bacteria swimming in the gut. “What we eat affects our gut. Too much of wrong eating affects the delicate gut lining causing a reduction in the absorption of micronutrients,” says Dhvani Shah, healing diet specialist. So, no amount of nutrition will do good to the body if you let the baddies overpower the digestive system.
  
  
 
  Could your microbes be talking to your brain? Science says yes. There is actually a gut-brain axis that decides your mental makeup and could even result in serious issues like Alzheimer’s. These bacteria cause butterflies in your tummy and give you intestinal cramps in anxious situations. The gut is your second brain and directly affects your mood and mind and vice versa. So treat your gut well to be happy yourself.
  
  
 
  While probiotics introduce good bacteria into the gut, prebiotics act as a fertiliser for the good bacteria that’s already there. Prebiotics naturally exist in many foods you may already consume on a regular basis, basically foods that are high in fibre. Some rich sources are banana, spinach, cucumber and carrots, tomatoes, garlic and onions, lentils and wheat bran. “For probiotics, stick to food like curd, buttermilk and tofu apart from herbs and spices like mint, lemon, cumin, ginger and turmeric that stimulate the production of digestive enzymes,” adds Shah.
  
  
 
  “Water is a powerful detoxifier because it assists the kidneys and colon to eliminate waste. Hydration means drinking water, not coffee, caffeinated teas or energy drinks that can further dehydrate the gut. Drink 8-10 glasses of water per day,” says Manjari Chandra, consultant therapeutic nutritionist.
