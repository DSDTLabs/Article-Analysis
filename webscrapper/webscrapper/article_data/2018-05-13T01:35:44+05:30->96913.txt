NEW DELHI: To encourage the culture of environment-friendly cycling inside the 325-acre IIT-Delhi campus, the institute has upgraded its public bicycle sharing (PBS) scheme. 

 Students can now access and pay for the bicycles parked at 13 docks through a customised mobile app. Users will have to pay Rs 2 for 15 minutes. According to   of  , the number of active users, which is now around 600, is likely to go up with the new app.
 
 Greenolution, the PBS service providers at IIT since 2017, has introduced an operation system that is a combination of both traditional docking station and the dockless sharing system, said  , an executive of the company. The students and the faculty of IIT can use the QR code at the docking stations and pay, following which   locks will open automatically, he added. 
 
 Students are also hopeful that the app, LetUsCycle, will increase the number of users. “We face lots of problems commuting in the campus. Often those who own cycles are fined for not parking at a designated spot. Now they can just take a bicycle on rent from an app-based docking station whenever required,” Aryaman Garg, deputy general secretary of the students’ council. 
 
 Lauding the cheap rent, Garg said this move would further encourage students to avoid buying cycles.
