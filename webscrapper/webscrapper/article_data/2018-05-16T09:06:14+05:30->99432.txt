LUCKNOW: They were born together but look different. For fraternal triplets  ,   and their sister  , their ICSE results were heartening. 

 As with a lot of things in the   household, celebrations on Monday also came in three parts. 
 
 While Kush scored 95.6%, Vaishnavi and Luv secured 85.6% and 85.4% respectively. 
 
 Consistently scoring well since early school years, the triplets, born just minutes apart, are always competing with one another. 
 
 Apart from their birthday though, they have little in common. 
 
 Vaishnavi, the eldest, aspires to be a banker, while Luv wants to be a merchant navy officer. The youngest of three, Kush, dreams of becoming an IAS officer after completing engineering. 
 
 They also have distinct characteristics. While Vaishnavi is short-tempered, Kush is calm and placid. 
 
  "Luv is a naughty boy. He is restless and invents mischief," said father  . During examinations, while Luv and Vaishnavi played badminton to keep stress at bay, Kush remained indoors and utilised time in sleeping. Even in school, the three, though in the same classroom, never sit together. 
 
 One thing unites them though: their love for food. "We have similar tastes and enjoy eating the same food," said Vaishnavi. Luv quipped, "We are also partners in crime and share the same blood group, B+." 
 
  Students of  , all three are NCC cadets. They study in different rooms but were each other's backbone during examinations. "Our mother, a lecturer, is our support system. She helped us with everything we wished for except allowing us to use social media and watch television during examinations," the trio said.
