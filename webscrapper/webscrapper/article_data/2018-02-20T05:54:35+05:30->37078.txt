PANAJI: Goa chief minister   is "giving final touches to his budget", which is scheduled for Thursday, from Lilavati Hospital in Mumbai, assembly speaker   told TOI on Monday.

 
 Parrikar, who is undergoing treatment for pancreatitis at the hospital, has almost finished preparing his budget speech and only the opening remarks are left, sources said. They said he is in constant touch with state government officials for finalising the budget.
 
 The former defence minister has authorised public works department minister Ramkrishna 'Sudin' Dhavalikar, who was appointed leader of the House in Parrikar's absence, to table the budget - a first in Goa's legislative assembly history.
 
 Dhavalikar said he has also been authorised to clear all files pertaining to the business of the House.
 
 But Dhavalikar, who represents the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) in the BJP-led coalition, said Parrikar will present the budget himself if he returns to Goa on Wednesday.
 
 After the budget is tabled, the government is likely to take a vote on account for five months, said Sawant. The discussion on the budget will take place in the next assembly session, likely in June or July.
 
 The business advisory committee of the assembly that met after the governor's address also decided to curtail the monthlong budget session to four days due to Parrikar's illness. Deputy speaker Michael Lobo said that the chief minister's medical reports have been sent to the US for taking a second opinion. He also said that if necessary, Parrikar,would be shifted to the US for medical treatment.
