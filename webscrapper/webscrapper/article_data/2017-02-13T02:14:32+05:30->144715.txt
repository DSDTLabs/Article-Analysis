NEW DELHI: A local   problem at Yamuna Bank station on the   led to delays and long waits for trains on Sunday. Commuters were stranded and had to wait for more than 20 minutes to catch a train, forcing many to abandon the   and opt for an autorickshaw or cab instead. 

 The issue was of interlocking, a signalling-based problem, said Delhi Metro Rail Corporation spokesman Anuj Dayal. “Because of a local interlocking issue at Yamuna Bank station for about seventeen minutes, there was minor delay in services on line 3 in that section.” The problem, which occurred at 4.28pm, was resolved by 4.45pm, added Dayal.
 
 While the issue was resolved within 20 minutes, the problem led to bunching of trains and long waits at platforms. “I missed the train which left at 4.27pm and waited till 4.50pm for the next train. I then left as I was getting late for an appointment,” said Ritu Banerjee, who waited for a train at the Mayur Vihar Phase I station for over 20 minutes.
 
 “To avoid delays, one train each was vacated at Pragati Maidan and Laxmi Nagar stations for short loops from Indraprastha and Yamuna Bank stations,” said Dayal adding it is a normal practice whenever proper headway is required to be maintained on a certain section. “Trains were evacuated at Indraprastha and Laxmi Nagar and reversed to pick up passengers.”
 
 It’s not the first time that the Blue line has encountered signalling issues. The corridor has been witnessing signalling related problems for months now, leading to delays and chaos in stations. A signalling issue — track circuit drop — near the Dwarka metro station last week led to trains running at restricted speed, which threw the schedule out of gear. 
 
 In January too, the same problem had occurred, exacerbated by a problem in the operations control centre (OCC) on the same day, which disrupted services on the line for two days.
