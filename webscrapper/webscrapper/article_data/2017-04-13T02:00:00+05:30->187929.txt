PATNA: Two senior IAS officials — state’s chief electoral officer (CEO)-cum-principal secretary (election) Ajay V Nayak (1984-batch) and Magadh divisional commissioner Lian Kunga (1985 batch) have been denied promotion to the   rank.

 Despite their seniority, the state government has notified the promotion of ELSN Bala Prasad and Sanjiv Kumar Sinha of 1986 batch to the rank of chief secretary in the top payscale of Rs2.25 lakh per month, on the basis of the departmental promotion committee (DPC) recommendations. Bala is principal secretary to the governor while Sinha was recently made Bihar State Staff Selection Commission chairman after the arrest of his predecessor Sudhir Kumar in the question paper leak case.
 
 The IAS Officers’ Association (Bihar chapter), in a memorandum submitted to chief minister and chief secretary following the arrest of 1987 batch officer Sudhir Kumar, had also raised its concern over the denial of promotion to Nayak to the chief secretary rank. Later, the association had withdrawn the memorandum.
 
 Sources in the general administration department (GAD) said the DPC withheld the promotion of Nayak and Kunga mainly because of pending departmental proceedings against them.
 
 Nayak is facing departmental proceedings on the recommendations of the Kosi Bandh Katan Judicial Inquiry Commission. He was the principal secretary in water resources department in 2008 when Kosi river breached an embankment at Kusaha, leading to a devastating flood in several north Bihar districts and causing huge loss of crops, livestock and human lives, a GAD official said.
 
 Kunga, who is to retire on May 31, is facing departmental proceedings in a case when he was posted in one of the districts of Jharkhand, which was part of Bihar before 2000.
