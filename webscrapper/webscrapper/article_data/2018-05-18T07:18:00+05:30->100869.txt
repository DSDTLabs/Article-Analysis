GHAZIABAD: For many years now, the city’s demand for a solid-waste treatment plant ( ) has not met with any success, and it’s proving to be a major impediment in keeping the city clean. 

 
 This is also one of the main reasons why Ghaziabad has ranked poorly in   over the years. But with a much-improved Swachh Survekshan ranking this year, the administration now looks determined to expedite the process of making the STP at  , which has been hanging fire for years, a reality.
 
 “Swachh Survekshan 2018, in which Ghaziabad has fared handsomely, has given us all the more reason to expedite work on the Galand STP,” said district magistrate  . “As of now, its status is that we are already in possession of 18 acres of land, and efforts are being made to acquire the remaining 17 acres. But we can begin operations with even the land available, and it’s for GMC to take a call,” she added. 
 
 The importance of the Galand STP could be understood from the fact that in its absence, the civic waste that the city generates daily, is being dumped at the   landfill site, which is already overflowing. 
 
 “The Pratap Vihar landfill site is located in the heart of the city, and every day, 850 tonnes of civic waste finds its way into it, which is one reason why we fared so badly in earlier Swachh Survekshans,” said Maheshwari. 
 
 “But once the Galand plant becomes operational, which I hope would be in seven months from now, we’ll be in a position to set up a waste-to-energy plant there, which will go a long way in helping us maintain cleanliness standards, and maybe improve our ranking in future Swach Sarvekashans,” she added.
 
 The Galand site will also allow civic agencies to clean up the Pratap Vihar landfill.
