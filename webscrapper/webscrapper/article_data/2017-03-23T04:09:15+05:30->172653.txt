KOLKATA: There was a major   near Dhakuria on the   on Wednesday afternoon when the driver of a Patuli-BBD Bag-route minibus got into a heated argument with a biker and his two pillion riders, both of whom were women. 

 The duo reportedly blocked the path of the bus, climbed on to it and snatched away the keys from the driver. 
 
 Even as the bus passengers protested, the traffic sergeant on duty had a hard time controlling the situation. It took several minutes of persuasion before they returned the keys to the driver. 
 
 The cops said the incident - in an area under the southeast traffic guard - was reported around 12.15pm. 
 
 A challan of rash driving was issued to the bus driver and the biker was warned before being let off. 
 
 The incident comes a couple of days after an auto driver fled with the keys of a government bus close to the Rashbehari crossing. 
 
 According to witnesses, the biker had reportedly tried to overtake the bus after crossing Jodhpur Park on way towards Golpark, when the minibus driver allegedly took a left turn and blocked his path. This angered the biker who then stopped the bike midway near the petrol pump close to Dakshinapan. "We are happy that no one was injured and everyone managed to come to some sort of agreement," said an officer from southeast traffic guard.
