BENGALURU: All Congress, JD(S) and two independent MLAs will stay put in hotels till chief minister-designate H D Kumaraswamy proves his majority in the floor test slated for Thursday, notwithstanding rumblings of discontent among the home-sick lawmakers. Kumaraswamy will take oath as CM on Wednesday. 

 T he two parties had, on Su- nday morning, decided to se- nd their MLAs to their constituencies as they had been away from their families since May 15. Many MLAs were eager to return home. The leaders, however, changed their decision and asked the MLAs to stay put in hotels till Thursday, fearing that BJP might poach them. They turned down the demand of the MLAs to allow them to visit their homes at least for a day. 
 
 While Congress MLAs are staying at Hilton near Kempegowda International Airport, JD(S) legislators were shifted from Le Meridien to a resort near Doddaballapur in the evening. Both Anand Singh and Pratapagouda Patil, who had resurfaced in the assembly in the nick of time on Saturday after going missing for four days, are camping with their Congress colleagues.
 
 " All our MLAs will stay put in hotels till the floor test is over. We are holding another round of meeting with MLAs on Monday," said KPCC president G Parameshwara. 
 
 Kumaraswamy met his party MLAs at Le Meridien and discussed government formation. He reportedly told the MLAs how important it is for the party to be in power for its survival and requested them to accept whatever decision he and his father HD Deve Gowda take with regard to the composition of the Cabinet.
 
 Congress leaders Siddaramaiah, Mallikarjun Khar- ge, DK Shivakumar and KC Venugopal held talks with their MLAs at Hilton and asked them to abide by the party's decision with regard to inclusion of MLAs in the ministry. "All decisions are being taken keeping 2019 Lok Sabha elections in mind and you should cooperate. BJP is still trying to lure our MLAs, so please be careful," Shivakumar told MLAs.
