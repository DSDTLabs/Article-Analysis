Panaji: Power minister Pandurang Madkaikar lent a patient ear to demands, complaints and suggestions from North Goa MLAs and ministers at a special meeting convened on Tuesday. He directed department engineers to be public-friendly and attend to calls regarding interruptions in power supply.  The department was told to expedite underground cabling, giving priority to major cities, followed by coastal and forest areas. Underground cabling is already complete in Benaulim and Quepemâ€™s town and market area are covered. Work is in progress in Canacona, Nuvem, Sanvordem and Calangute. There are proposals for underground cabling in Vasco, Navelim, Porvorim and Fatorda. In Ribandar, tendering is awaited.  Madkaikar requested engineers to check the feasibility of providing transformers and sub-stations as demanded by MLAs and ministers for their constituencies. Sub-stations at Sal, Baddem, Karaswaddo, Patto and Calangute will be tendered shortly.  Madkaikar instructed representatives of Bharat Vikas Group (BVG) India Limited, that is implementing the LED street lighting project in the state, to attend to complaints regarding non-functioning street lights. MLAs and ministers were informed that each constituency would receive 50 poles to facilitate quick replacement during the monsoon and that old conductors and other material would be replaced. Requests were also made for crane trucks at all sub-divisions. The department is also considering having at least one mobile transformer per sub-division as a stop-gap arrangement in case a transformer fails. Complaints of frequent power cuts were received from Bambolim, Chimbel, St Andre and Pilar where additional line staff has been demanded. St Andre MLA Francisco Silveira complained about banks not accepting payments for electricity bills. Madkaikar assured him that the department has already begun accepting payments online and will soon launch apps to facilitate payments.
