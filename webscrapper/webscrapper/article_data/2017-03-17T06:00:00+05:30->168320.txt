KOLKATA: A clash broke out on Thursday afternoon between police and villagers in   over an alleged attempt to fill up a lake called Bhaba Dighi, which is the “only stumbling block” for the 89km  . 

 Villagers attacked the Trinamool office, assaulted local party leaders and set ablaze six motorcycles belonging to cops. A huge enforcement from   headquarters was deployed to bring the situation under control.
 
 The locals alleged the 18-acre waterbody, belonging collectively to the villagers, was being filled up against their wishes. 
 
 A mob led by local community leaders   and Sabitri Malik went to the local Trinammol office and sought an explanation. They went on a rampage after getting no satisfact-ory answer. They also attacked the police when they came to the rescue of the Trinamool leaders.
 
 Roy said that more than 51 families are completely dependent on the waterbody as each family gets fish worth Rs 20,000 annually. 
 
 Hooghly DM Sanjay Bansal said the administration has already spoken with the villagers and the issue will be resolved shortly. 
 
 The railways is supposed to fill up three acres of the lake for laying the tracks. 
 
  Eastern Railway general manager,   said, “This is a special project under the Railways Act. The state has extended all help. The entire stretch from Moinapur to Kamarpukur is available. The only problem is with the lake. The project will considerably reduce the travel time.”
 
 Significantly, the railway line from Tarakeswar to Goghat is ready and the service had started in 2010. Services are on from Bishnupur to Moinapur as well. Only Jairambati and Kamarpukur need to be linked with Goghat. Sandip Chakraborty, the leader of the group of priests at Tarakeswar said, “It is unfair to leave a railway project suspended because of a few families. The railway project will help thousands. If needed, we may stage counter-agitation against the Bhaba Dighi movement.”
