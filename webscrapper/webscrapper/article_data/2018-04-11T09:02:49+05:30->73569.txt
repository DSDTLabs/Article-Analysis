AHMEDABAD: Additional chief metropolitan magistrate in Court No 3 at   has pulled up a Meghaninagar police sub-inspector ( ) for his alleged inaction at the behest of the superior officer and commented that the police official should be shown   movie to make him an upright police officer like the hero of the film.

 This happened during a remand proceeding on Monday evening involving one Chetan Sharma, who was booked under liquor prohibition case. 
 
 During the hearing, Sharma’s advocates told the court that Sharma was implicated in a prohibition case after his family members took out a protest rally against local bootleggers. The complaint against Sharma was lodged in February, and there was no immediate reason to arrest him suddenly and seek his remand.
 
 The judicial officer inquired with the PSI why the accused was not arrested earlier. PSI Desai told the court that the   had asked him not to take action immediately without proper inquiry. This led the judge to comment: “Show him (the PSI) Singham film so that he becomes an officer like him. Have you not seen in the film that the cop defies his superior’s order to release an accused? Be an officer like him.”
 
 The court refused police’s request for Sharma’s remand and said: “Give him a CD of the film and make sure that it is of good quality. I will bear the cost.”
 
 The court on Tuesday released Sharma on bail, said his advocate Jagat Patel.
