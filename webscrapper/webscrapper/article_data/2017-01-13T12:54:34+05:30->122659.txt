NEW DELHI: Indian women boxers were assured of five medals in the season-opening 6th Nation's Cup after four pugilists entered the semi-finals while one made the final of the event being held in Vrbas, Serbia.

 The ones who have made the semi-finals are former World Championships silver-medallist   (48kg),   (60kg),   (69kg), and former Asian Games bronze-medallist   (75kg).
 
 Seema Punia (+81kg) is through the final courtesy a bye as her category has only three boxers in fray.
 
 The tournament is being competed among 18 countries in all and features three rounds of three minutes each as mandated by the new International Boxing Association (AIBA) technical rules.
 
 Of the four semi-finalists, Pooja is through to the medal rounds owing to a bye. Kavita, Sarjubala and Priyanka, however, won a bout each to advance.
 
 While Sarjubala out-classed local favourite Katarina Djurovic in the first three minutes of her opening bout, Priyanka got the better of Lithuania's Vaida Masiokaite 3-0.
 
 Kavita, on the other hand, defeated Russia's Olga Lapekha in her preliminary contest.
 
 Neeraja (51kg) is in the quarter-finals and will face Greece's Aik Koutsogeorgopoulou.
 
 However, there was disappointment for World Championships silver-medallist Saweety Boora (81kg), Shiksha (54kg), Sonia (57kg), Simranjeet Kaur (64kg) and Pooja (69kg).
 
 All of them lost in the preliminary stages. Of these, Shiksha, Sonia and Saweety were quarter-finalists.
 
 The tournament is the first for Indian women boxers under the tutelage of new coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu, who served as the men's coach for more than two decades.
