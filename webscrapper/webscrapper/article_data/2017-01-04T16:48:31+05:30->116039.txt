AHMEDABAD: Known for its prowess in manufacturing, Gujarat also seems to be fast catching up in the information technology (IT) sector if outstanding investments data compiled by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) is anything to go by. 

  The industry body's analysis shows that the state ranks second after Karnataka, the hub of the IT industry, in attracting investments during the period 2005-06 to 2015-16.
 
 Of the total Rs 2.2 lakh crore of outstanding investments attracted in the IT sector across India during the decade, Gujarat comes second with a share of 16.7% or Rs. 35,284 crore. Karnataka tops the list with 23.8% or Rs. 58,679 crore of outstanding investment as on 2015-16.
 
 "Investments attracted by Gujarat in the IT sector increased from a meagre Rs 700 crore in 2005-06 to over Rs 35,200 crore in 2015-16 thereby clocking a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 48%," states the analysis by the ASSOCHAM Economic Research Bureau (AERB).
 
 The other three states in the top five are Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu with shares of 13.3%, 12.2% and 6.6% respectively.
 
 Commenting on the growth of the IT industry in the state, Anupam Bhatnagar, secretary, GESIA, said, "Earlier, Gujarat was a manufacturing hub. 
 
 However, as the IT industry was established and began to flourish with NRI investments, the industry has grown well. Today, there are close to 2,000 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) firms in Ahmedabad of the total 5,000-6,000 IT firms in the state."
 
 About investments, Bhatnagar said, "Sectors such as Internet of Things, data analytics, digital and financial inclusion have not just been on the government's priority list but have been lucrative investment opportunities as well. Going forward, we may expect more investments in this sector."
 
 Experts believe that the state government must create a vibrant IT ecosystem by rolling out more lucrative, investor-friendly policies supported by numerous measures to facilitate licensing, thereby simplifying investment procedures, to help attract more investments.
 
 "Gujarat not only accounted for the second highest share in terms of total outstanding investments attracted by IT sector across India but also clocked second highest decadal CAGR after Andhra Pradesh (51%)," said D S Rawat, secretary general, ASSOCHAM.
