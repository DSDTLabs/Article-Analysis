MUMBAI: A sessions court has upheld the conviction and one year sentence awarded to a 30-year-old Sewri based housewife who bit and assaulted two woman constables at Bhaucha Dhakka who asked her and the crowd who had come to watch the high tide to step back for their safety. 

 The woman  's husband, Ramesh Patharu (35), too was sentenced to one year in jail for the assault. The incident took place on the evening of July 20, 2014. 
 
 Constable Sunanda Shinde and a few other police personnel requested the crowd not to stay at the spot of the high tide viewing for long. It was alleged that at that time, one woman later identified as the accused started abusing her. Shinde requested the woman to stop the abuse. However, Shobha rushed towards another woman constable present there, pulled her hair, caught hold of her and started assaulting her. 
 
 When Shinde requested the woman to stop, the woman allegedly kicked her and bit the other woman constable. A man, later identified as the co-accused was helping her in the assault.
 
 On October 9, 2015, the couple was found guilty by the magistrate's court. Following this, they filed an appeal before the sessions court against the judgement. 
 
 The sessions court however said that based on the evidence, the order of the magistrate court's order finding the duo guilty under section 332 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code was confirmed.
