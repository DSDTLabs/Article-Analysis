DADRI:   Limited installed a Robotic Dry Cleaning System ( ) for the solar panels at its solar PV plant in Dadri on Thursday. This is the first time in India a robotic method is being used for cleaning solar panels, said D K Sood, regional executive director NTPC Dadri, Badarpur and   (DBF).

 The RDCS, which has been built at a cost of Rs 76 lakh, has been designed by an Israel-based company called Ecoppia. Most of the RDCS parts are manufactured in Chennai and some other parts of India.
 
 After inaugurating the RCDS, Sood said that apart from being the first of its kind in India, RDCS is remote-managed and -monitored, self-powered, energy-independent and self-cleaned, making it best suited for remote solar sites.
 
 “No manpower is required to clean the solar panels,” Sood said.
 
 Further, RDCS conserves water and reduces power generation loss because of soiling to the extent of 3-4 %.
 
 The total installed capacity of NTPC across the country has become 48,143MW with the addition of 115MW of Bhadla solar power project commissioned on Wednesday taking NTPC’s solar capacity to 475MW. NTPC contributes nearly 24% of the country’s power generation.
