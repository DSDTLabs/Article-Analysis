Rohan Mehra denies having second thoughts about his decision to quit a big show like   for Bigg Boss. He said, “I do not regret my decision. The reality show gave me an opportunity to interact with Bollywood’s two most important stars —   and  , and that feeling is more important than being in 
any show or a 
 superhit film.”
 Ask Rohan, if his girlfriend and co-actor from his former show  , had any reasons to get insecure about his closeness with other fellow female contestants in the house, and he said, “I shared a very warm equation with one or two lady friends that I made in the house and hope that my friendship will continue with them. But it is only friendship and if Kanchi gets possessive about me, it is healthy. A girlfriend should be possessive about her boyfriend and there is nothing wrong in that. But at the same time, I would like to say that I am very serious about Kanchi. I kept her picture near my bed and spoke to her 1,000 times in the day. She is very dear to me. And I am happy that we are in a very good phase of our relationship right now.”
