NEW DELHI:   has   an   with the Supreme Court-appointed   to discuss the issues involving the ongoing   in the capital. The decision to approach the monitoring committee and seek a solution to the problems posed by the sealing drive was taken at the all-party meeting held on Tuesday at CM Arvind Kejriwal’s residence.

 In a letter to the committee, Kejriwal said that the council of ministers are ready to meet the committee, either at the secretariat or at any designated place of the committee’s convenience. It is likely that the council of ministers will discuss the master plan and its interpretations, among other related issues and try and find a solution.
 
 The sealing drive in the city is being carried out from December on the directions of the monitoring committee for violations in the Master Plan 2021 and the failure to pay land use conversion charges.
 
 There is, however, no clarity whether Delhi government will take an all-party delegation to meet the monitoring committee or only its council of ministers. In a press conference on Tuesday, deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that an all-party delegation would call upon the monitoring committee for discussion on the issue of sealing.
 
 BJP had boycotted the all-party meeting on Tuesday.
