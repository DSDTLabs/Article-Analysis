KOLHAPUR: Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendent of Shivaji Maharaj, condemned the vandalizing of playwright Ram Ganesh Gadkari’s bust at Pune’s Sambhaji Garden on Tuesday.

 “The writings of   on   Maharaj are seriously controversial but the same should be countered by legal means,” he told TOI.
 
 Gadkari’s statue was targeted by alleged members of   for his “derogatory” remarks against Chhatrapati Sambhaji in his play ‘Rajsanyas’, written 90 years ago.
 
 “I condemn the act. No one should take law into their hands,” added Sambhajiraje. 
 
 The city-based historian Indrajit Sawant, who has done extensive research on Shivaji’s life, said Gadkari defamed Sambhaji Maharaj through his writings. “The act of Sambhaji Brigade is a purification of history. The bust of Gadkari was installed in the garden named after Sambhaji Maharaj. This itself is distortion of history and an act to justify his writings,” he said.
