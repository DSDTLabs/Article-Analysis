QUEPEM: Long queues for registering new   cards have caused immense resentment among people in   and Sanguem taluka, as they have to make repeated trips to complete formalities.

 A simple requirement for registering the name for a card means the Aadhaar card seeker has to make numerous and lengthy trips, sources said.
 
 A specified date is fixed once in a month to secure appointments to furnish papers, due to which people from far-off places in Quepem and Sanguem talukas are facing hardships in getting their Aadhaar cards issued. “When people approach the office, they are not given appointments, but are told to come on a particular day for the appointment. After that date, they are called on the next date for registration, thus requiring three trips for a simple task,” stated former chairperson of Quepem municipal council,  .
 
 The Quepem Aadhaar card registration office is located at the primary health centre, while the   office is functioning in a private building. 
 
 Officials from Quepem and Curchorem offices said that they have fixed March 15 and 16 respectively for appointments. Hence, the applicants have been told to appear on that date, an official said.
 
  (GEL) official   said that the Curchorem and Quepem offices have only one operator, and added that people fail to turn up after taking appointments. Hence only one day in a month is fixed for taking appointments, he said. The operator at Quepem office said that only 30 appointments are fixed in a month.
