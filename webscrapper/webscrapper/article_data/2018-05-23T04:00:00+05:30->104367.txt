Surat: Tapi river, the perennial river which passes through the Diamond City, looks almost dead.   is stifling recreation in the river starved of water because of scanty rainfall in its catchment areas in the past few years. Garbage has only made matters worse for the river which is gasping for breath. May be for these reasons, Hindi film actor Salman Khan once mistook the river for a ‘nullah’. 

 The question is thus: How much will the one-month-long cleanliness drive by the state government under Sujalam Suflam Jal Yojana change the river’s fate?
 
 Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology’s Professor Jayanti Patel told TOI, “The removal of water hyacinth does not offer a permanent solution. The wild vegetation would reappear if it is not removed from the roots. We need to remove water vegetation permanently and also desilt the river.” 
 
 Tapi’s flowing capacity through the city has got reduced to three lakh cusecs from six lakh cusecs one-and-half-decade ago. A couple of years ago, Gujarat Government had sanctioned Rs957 crore for ‘Tapi sudhikaran’ project. All the sewer gates in the upstream of the river were to be closed during the phase-1 of the project. The fact is waste still continues to flow into the river from the 14 sewer gates. And if a decision is taken to desilt the river, the process would take two years to complete.
