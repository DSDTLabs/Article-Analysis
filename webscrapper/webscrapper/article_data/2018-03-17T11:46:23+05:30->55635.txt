  : The   government's   to help economically backward families to marry off their daughters by organizing mass weddings has not received the expected response in most of the 75 districts in the state due to poor publicity of the scheme. 

 Under the scheme, mass marriages are conducted by the social welfare department. A sun of Rs 35,000 is spent on each couple, besides bestowing them with household items as gifts. However, the mass weddings have been in the news recently after several cases of already married couple remarrying to avail of benefits came to light.
 
 After encountering such problems in implementing the scheme, the government has decided to spend 2% of total budget of the scheme on publicity. All 75 districts have been allocated Rs 1.66 crore each to organize mass marriages. District social welfare officer here,  , said they were given a target of arranging 476 weddings before March 31. But sources said till now only around 60 couples had tied the knot under the scheme in Bareilly district. "It would definitely be useful if some money is spent on publicity. However, we are continuously spreading awareness about the scheme through officials of civic bodies but the results are not satisfactory. Just 2% of the budget for publicity comes to Rs 3.32 lakh. It will help us reach out to more people living in far flung rural areas," he said.
 
 In Bareilly district, 17 couples were married off in a mass wedding function on February 24 in the presence of state irrigation minister  . But after cross verification, five of the couple were found to be already married. Following that, chief development officer Satendra Singh suspended additional development officer of Aonla tehsil. 
 
 Under the mass wedding scheme, the government deposits Rs 20,000 in the woman's account and spends an additional sum of Rs 10,000 on gifts. If the woman is a widow or a divorcee, Rs 25,000 is deposited in her account, while Rs 5,000 is spent on household items for her.
