Mumbai: Shares of   (SBI) jumped 1.7% to Rs 308 on the stock exchange after the lender reported a   of Rs 2,815 crore for Q4FY17, which is more than double the Rs 1,264-crore figure reported in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The net profit jumped 123% on the back of higher net interest income and a nearly 10% drop in provisions for bad   to Rs 10,993 crore from Rs 12,139 crore in the previous year.

 Addressing reporters through a video conference from Kolkata, where the annual board meeting was held, SBI chairman   said that although loans grew at only 7.9% due to sluggish demand from big businesses, retail loans grew 21% driven by a 17% growth in home loans and 34% growth in other loans in the personal segment.
 
 The net profit for the whole year stood at Rs 10,484 crore — 5.4% higher than Rs 9,951 crore in the previous year. The bank ended the year with total deposits of Rs 20.44 lakh crore and total loans of Rs 13.41 lakh crore — an increase of 18% and 8% respectively.
 
 The bank’s ratio of gross   ( ) improved marginally from 7.23% as of December 2016 to 6.9% as of end March 2017. The ratio was still elevated compared with 6.5% in March 2016. Bhattacharya said that the bank would need to continue making provisions for bad loans in FY18 as   rules required that any sacrifices made during a loan resolution process need to be provided upfront.
 
 “We will have slightly elevated credit cost in FY18 as we go ahead with resolution of NPAs. As of now, RBI requires all provisions to be made up front. It is because of this we have done almost Rs 1,700 crore of provisions over and above regulatory requirement. However, FY19 should be much better,” said Bhattacharya.
 
 She pointed out that the results for FY17 would be the last stand-alone results for the bank as from the current fiscal the bank has consolidated the business of its five associate banks and   with itself. “SBI is now among the top 50 global banks and four times the size of its nearest domestic competitor. If you consider the physical infrastructure of 24,000 branches, we are the second largest bank in the world,” she said.
