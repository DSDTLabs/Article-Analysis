 has a knack for rubbing people the wrong way with his distasteful Twitter posts. One of his frequent targets is  . The filmmaker recently challenged Tiger to have a street fight with action hero, Vidyut Jammwal. The latter went on to record Ramu’s conversation, in which he could be heard calling Tiger “the greatest woman” he had seen. 

 Seems, filmmaker   was quite offended by Ramu’s choice of words. The ‘Happy New Year’ director tweeted, “Sad that some people think calling somebody a "woman" is an insult!! It should be highest compliment actually!” 
 
  
 Tiger, on his part, has been graceful about the entire episode. When asked for his reaction to Ramu’s tweets, the ‘Heropanti’ actor said, “RGV is a senior person, he has been in the industry for years. I've just recently entered the industry. Ab agar mann ki baat bolu toh shayad appropriate nahi hoga (It won't be appropriate if I speak my heart out).”
