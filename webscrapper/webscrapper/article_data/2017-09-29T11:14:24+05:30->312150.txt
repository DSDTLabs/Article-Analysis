CHENNAI: More than 200 daily wage workers at Neelangarai received free spectacles following a screening at an eye camp organised recently (Wednesday).

 In an event organised by city-based   (IVI) and Essilor Vision Foundation, about 400 wage workers participated in the medical camp and got their eyes checked. In that, about 238 workers received free spectacles post the eye tests.
 
 Former mayor of Chennai and   M  , who distributed the spectacles, appreciated the efforts taken to conduct the screening and giving away spectacles for free to a marginalized section of the society.
 
 Vinod Daniel, CEO, IVI, said they would continue to conduct similar camps for other communities including the fisherfolk, school children and the elderly. In August, the NGO distributed free sunglasses to fishermen in   to protect their eyes from harmful ultraviolet rays while fishing at mid-sea. 
 
 “The Neelangarai initiative will reach a marginalized community. We have made a beginning and it is hoped we will be able to cover many more communities in the coming days,” he said.
