ALLAHABAD: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( ) is not happy over anti-government stand taken by its international working president  , who recently alleged that a conspiracy was being hatched to kill him in fake encounter, and seems ready to show him the door.

 On January 16, Togadia caused ripples in political circles after he went missing for hours, only to be found unconscious in a park in Ahmedabad. He was rushed to a hospital and made the allegation after discharge.
 
 "  has lost his position in VHP. Most people in the organization are happy that he has been sidelined. His recent act is a proof of his indiscipline. He won't be tolerated in the organization any more," said Swami Chinmayanand, a senior member of  , the highest decision-making body of VHP.
 
 "Ask anyone in VHP about Togadia's position today and you won't get an answer. Though no one will say so, everyone in the organisation is happy that he has been sidelined," he said while speaking over phone from Haridwar.
 
 However, Tagodia seemed to be still enjoying sympathy in the organization. Several leaders who came to attend VHP Sant Sammelan during Magh Mela voiced support for him. VHP general secretary   said, "Kaun kehta hai VHP ne unse kinara kar liya. Togadia ji hamare priya hain, samaaj ke priya hain (Who says Togadia ji has been sidelined by VHP. He is dear to us and to the society)."
