BHOPAL: Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s eldest   is looking to don a new political avatar in poll-bound Kolaras.

 Over the last two days, since his arrival in Kolaras on Saturday, 23-year-old Kartikeya has not only addressed a convention of the   community there, but also took on   stalwart and   MP Jyotiraditya Scindia for calling his father’s ministerial colleagues as ‘Kaurav Ki Sena’.
 
 “This amounts to debasing of the political discourse,” said Kartikeya who recently had been making news for his entrepreneurial ventures in the fields of floriculture and dairy.
 
 Addressing the Dhakad community, Kartikeya said that they need not look at the BJP candidate in the Kolaras by-election but to his father Shivraj. Referring to Scindia’s remark on Saturday in which he said that Kolaras would be a fight between him and the chief minister, the Chouhan scion said that his father does not have a fight with anybody but poverty.
 
 Meanwhile a buoyant Congress, following results of the Chitrakoot bypoll, is confident of retaining both Kolaras and Mungaoli seats courtesy its traditional vote bank.
