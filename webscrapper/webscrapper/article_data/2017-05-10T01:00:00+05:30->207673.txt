If you’re looking for controversy here, you won’t find any. It just happened that a father went around looking for a great backdrop for a picture, only to find it in the confines of the family’s home. This is perhaps a thought that resonates with   for sure. BT has it the cover of his recent biography was shot inside his son   Kapoor’s walk-in that comprises his bathroom, a make-up table and his wardrobe, in their three-storeyed make-shift home.

 It turns out that   and  , the photographer assigned for the job, for weeks, scouted several locations in and around the city, including  , the photographer’s own studio and Carter Road. A luxury four-wheeler was also arranged for the shot but none seem to have worked as much as the picture taken inside Ranbir’s private space. A source close to the project lets in, “Rishi was even shot in his balcony but it didn’t work although it went well with the theme and title of the book. Eventually, Ranbir’s walk-in worked out beautifully. Ranbir wasn’t home when the picture was shot. The space was almost as big as some of the homes you find in the city.”
 
 Bring up the story behind the picture and Rishi says, “The photographer liked the backdrop a lot. The bulbs on the dressing table added the feel of cinema. The red in the background also added to the charm of the frame. When he shot the picture, we knew this is the one that will make the cut.”
