Elisabeth Moss, who won the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series statuette for her performance in "The Handmaid's Tale", does not remember much of what happened after she took to the stage to accept her trophy.

 The 35-year-old star's speech was bleeped out after she swore while paying tributes to her mother but Moss says it was a surreal moment for her to be on the stage, reported E! News.
 
 
 
 
 
 "I blacked out. I really did. I don't really remember much of it. I've never experienced them actually calling my name, so it was a very strange feeling.
 
 "It's like an out of body experience - and then you immediately try to remember everybody you have to thank!" she said.
 
 Moss said it was the "clean" version of the speech. "There were two, unfortunately. That was the best version you could have possibly gotten of that. That was the clean version. No, I was just trying to remember everybody.
 
 "And you really do have a weird out-of-body experience. It's always a surprise," she said.
