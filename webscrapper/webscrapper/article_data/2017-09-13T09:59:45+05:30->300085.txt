CHENNAI:   has barred authorities from taking any final decision on scores of regularisation applications submitted by owners of unauthorised buildings in the state.

 Making it clear that authorities should not take any final decision without taking prior permission from the court, the first bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar said: "Applications for regularisation may be entertained and proceeded, but no final decision thereon shall be taken without the leave of the court." 
 
 The judges issued the clarification on Monday while hearing a PIL moved by advocate VBR Menon assailing the validity of government orders allowing such regularisations. Claiming that the orders dated June 22 under Section 113-C of the   Town and Country Planning Act, 1971, were just old wine in new bottles, the petitioner wanted the court to quash them.
 
 He pointed out that there were no provisions in the proposed regularisation scheme to deal with illegal constructions that came up after 2007, including additions and modifications made to already existing buildings, with or without sanctioned plans.
 
 The proposed scheme has been announced without conducting necessary comprehensive studies and collection of detailed data and statistics regarding the geographical distribution, age, extents and categories of the illegally constructed buildings across the state, he claimed.
 
 â€œHaving totally failed to perform their duties all along, the authorities do not have any right to seek any further Regularisation scheme until they identify and regularise all illegal constructions prior to 1999 under Section 113-A of the Act of 1971, the petitioner said and added that the only purpose of notifying the orders for regularisation appears to be to somehow fill up the state coffers, which were reported to be almost empty at present.
