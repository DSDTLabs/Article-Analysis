LUDHIANA: A 42-year-old debt-ridden farmer committed suicide at his house in   village, Ludhiana district, on Wednesday night. 

 The police said   was under a debt of about Rs 20 lakh. “He had taken loans from two banks and a money lender. Besides, a financier was pestering him to return the money he lent to his friend,” a cop said. 
 
 After dinner around 9pm on Wednesday, Jaspal went to his room on the first floor of his house. He asked his wife, Rajwans Kaur, to wake him up at 6am as he had to go for some work. Around 6am when Jaspal’s mother Pyar Kaur, 65, went to wake him up, she found him dead. On hearing her cries, other family members rushed to his room and found a poisonous substance near his body. They then called up the police.
 
 The police recovered a suicide note from the spot. In the note, Jaspal wrote that Devinder Singh, a resident of Nizampur who runs a finance company in Malaudh, was harassing him to repay his friend’s loan. 
 
 Jaspal’s friend had taken a bike loan from Devinder. As Jaspal stood as guarantor, Devinder started asking him to pay back the loan after his friend died in an accident, the cop added. 
 
 Jaspal’s nephew,  , said, “My uncle had sold four of the five acres our family owned to repay his loans. He had even sold his buffalo to pay Rs 21,000 to Devinder. But Devinder kept harassing him to pay the shortfall.”
 
 An abetment to suicide case has been registered against Devinder.
 
 Malaudh police took the body to civil hospital for a post-mortem examination.
 
 Jaspal is survived by his mother, wife and two sons, aged 19 and 17.
