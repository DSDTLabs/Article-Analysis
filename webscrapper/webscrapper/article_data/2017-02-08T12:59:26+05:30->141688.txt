PONDA: A  , Ponda, on Tuesday objected to the ongoing work on a stretch of National Highway (NH) 4-A at Curti. Its members stated that they want the space, which has presently been earmarked for service roads, to be utilized as a parking spot for devotees attending namaz at the dargah.

 An elevated stretch of the NH, with service roads to the village on either side, passes by the dargah. The   (NHAI) had acquired the 45-metre-wide stretch for the purpose in 1988. Around 50% of the work on the highway has been completed at an estimated cost of 100 crore.
 
 When officials of the public works department’s (PWD)   division visited the site to quell protests, the agitating group demanded that a flyover be constructed instead of an elevated road, and that the space allotted for service roads be converted into parking slots.
 
 Executive engineer of the national highways division, Vijay Mardolkar, said it would be difficult to change the plan as most of the work was completed. “Nevertheless, I have told them (the   members) to submit a written request which will be sent to the higher-ups. Meanwhile work on the particular part has been stopped,” he added.
