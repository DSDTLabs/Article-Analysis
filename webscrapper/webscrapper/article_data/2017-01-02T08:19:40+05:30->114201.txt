BHOPAL: Personal security officers (PSOs) continue to give a tough time to Vyapam scam   Ashish Chaturvedi. This time it's his new PSO Manoj Gurjar â€” who apparently lost his mobile while taking a nap outside Chaturvedi's house late on Thursday. 

 "If he cannot safeguard his mobile set and sleep on duty, do you think he would be able to ensure safety and security of my family?" asks Chaturvedi.
 
 Gwalior SP Dr Ashish has initiated an inquiry into the matter after PSO alleged that it was Chaturvedi who had snatched his mobile phone. 
 
 "What a joke, an underweight person like me can snatch a mobile phone from a trained policemen," he said. Gwalior police have changed more than 200 PSOs for Chaturvedi in the last three years.
 
 "I have a long list of PSOs. I think posting someone on my security has become a punishment strategy for policemen. In fact my security is considered a punishment posting by these PSOs," he said. 
 
 According to sources many of the PSO have refused to continue with Chaturvedi as he moves around in a bicycle and a few left complaining problems with his attitude. 
 
 Meanwhile, with more and more Vyapam accused getting bail, those who blew the lid off on the country's largest recruitment scam including Chaturvedi now fear for their life. 
 
 Most of the accused, barring Nitin Mohindra and Pankaj Trivedi, have managed to get bail from the court. While Gwalior-based Ashish Chaturvedi had approached the inspector general Gwalior range for additional security cover.
