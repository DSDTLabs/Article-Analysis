HYDERABAD: To make management studies more relevant to Indian business requirements, the   (AICTE) has decided to incorporate the accounting scandal of Satyam, the NSEL crisis and   fiasco into the new curriculum from the ensuing academic year. 

 The revamped curriculum will be used for the master of business administration (MBA) and post graduate diploma in management (PGDM) courses that, up until now, was largely influenced by what's followed by management schools in the US. 
 
 The curriculum will also cover subjects like the increasing trend of wilful loan defaulters to banks and huge deposits made by some business firms/individuals during demonetisation. "The model curriculum is more focused on various key areas such as entrepreneurship and innovation, not for profit sectors. Apart from this, Indian ethos and business ethics will help students develop their foundation in the Indian context by learning about Upanishads, Vedas and Chanakya's work," said  , dean, Institute of Public Enterprise.
 
 The committee proposed that the MBA/PGDM programme must have 54 credits of core courses and 42 credits of electives. "The minimum number of classroom teaching credits for MBA/PGDM programme should be 96 credits (one credit equals 10 hours) and field work/ internship should be at 6 credits, thus the minimum number of credits for award of MBA/ PGDM course should be 102 credits," read the model curriculum put up on the AICTE website.
