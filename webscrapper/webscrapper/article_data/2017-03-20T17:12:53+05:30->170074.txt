 The 'Jolly LLB 2' actor quipped that this movie also sends a message to husbands to "not pick up fights with them as they get to know everything". 
 
 Akshay will reprise his role as   in the Shivam Nair film, which is the spin-off of the 2015 film 'Baby'. The actor said Shabana was picked up for the spin-off because out of all the 'Baby' characters, her background story was the most interesting. 
 
 Akshay also said this is a one-of-a-kind film because for the first time, the audiences will get to know the making of a spy. "Till today, whatever spy films have been made in India, the making of a a spy has not been shown. We always show them as if they were born spies. 'Naam Shabana' is all about that," said Akshay, who is also a co-producer of the movie. 
 
 The film penned by Neeraj Pandey also stars Manoj Bajpayee and Prithiviraj Sukumaran with Anupam Kher and Danny Denzongpa.
