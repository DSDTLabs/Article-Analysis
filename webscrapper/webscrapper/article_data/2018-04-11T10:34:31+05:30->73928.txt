LUCKNOW: It is official now, of the 86 lakh farmers identified by the   government about a year ago for the  , only 36 lakh have so far been benefited. The government is likely to end this scheme after April 15. 

 Agriculture minister   said that the   government had released a little over Rs20,000 crore for nearly 36 lakh farmers to waive their loans, availed from banks before March 16, 2016. When asked why not even half of the farmers identified had benefited, Shahi squarely blamed banks for wrong tabulations in this regard. The CM, in his first  , had announced that the government had identified 86 lakh farmers and would release Rs36,000 crore to banks for writing off their loans.
 
 Shahi though said that the government had initially ended the scheme on March 10 last year, but the scheme was extended up to April 15 in order to net maximum number of farmers. The minister said that the BJP government was committed to the farmers' welfare and to offer the loan waiver scheme to all, but the government was helpless if the farmers don't fulfil certain conditions.
