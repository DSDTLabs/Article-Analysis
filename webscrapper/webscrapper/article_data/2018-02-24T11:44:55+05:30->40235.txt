 star   has opened up about dropping out of middle school to pursue her acting career.

  
  
 In a sneak peek for her chat with  , the 27-year-old admitted she left school at the age of 14.
 
 "I dropped out of middle school. I don't technically have a GED or a diploma. I am self-educated," she told.
 
 Lawrence explained, "I struggled through school. I never felt very smart. And when I'm reading the script and I feel like I know exactly what it would look like if somebody felt that way, that was a whole part of my brain that I didn't even know existed, something I could be confident in, and I didn't want to let it go."
 
 When asked if she regretted the decision, the   star responded, "No. I really don't. I wanted to forge my own path. I found what I wanted to do, and I didn't want anything getting in the way of it. Even friends, for many years, were not as important to me as my career. I mean, from the age of 14."
