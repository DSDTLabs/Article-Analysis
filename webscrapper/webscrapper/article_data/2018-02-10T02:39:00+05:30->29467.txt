Guntur: An eight-year-old boy was tortured at Gopal Pet area in Guntur district. The incident came to light on Friday after neighbours enquired about matter. 

 They were shocked to find severe burn injuries on little Joseph’s face, back and leg.
 
 Nallapadu police reached the spot and sent the boy to Guntur Government General Hospital for treatment. It was revealed that Joseph’s mother, Rizwana, abandoned him a month ago for a lover. In a revenge act, Rizwana’s former paramour Ganji Eashwar Rao (23) who was in an inebriated state thrashed Joseph and inflicted burn injuries using a hot pan. Cops arrested Rao and filed a case against him under Juvenile Justice Act. Women and child welfare department are providing shelter and care for the boy.
