PATNA: Bihar labour resources minister   has said   will be ordered in the state to get rid of criminals, if need be.

 Responding to questions on crime rise, Sinha told TOI on Tuesday, “Criminals should be dealt with strictly. Police should be given full freedom to handle them and, if need be, they can go for encounters.”
 
 The current state government, just like NDA-I, fully supports police and has given them a free hand, the minister said and added the increase in crime was the result of Grand Alliance government of which the RJD was a partner.
 
 “Though CM Nitish Kumar brooked no nonsense, the morale of criminals went up during the previous regime because the RJD was also in the government,” Sinha said and claimed the present government was trying its best to curb crime.
 
 Reacting to the minister’s remark, RJD spokesperson Chitranjan Gagan said crime rate during the previous regime was less than today. 
 
 RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari also said that encounter was a tool to suppress weaker sections of the society. He described the minister’s statement as a ‘crazy’ one.
 
 “Police are busy implementing prohibition and minting money through it. Whose encounter will they do? They reach the place of occurrence after the crime,” Tiwari said and alleged most of the people killed in encounters in UP were SCs, STs, OBCs or minorities.
