New Delhi: The government may prune the goods and services shipments target of $900 billion fixed for 2020 when it unveils a mid-term review of India's foreign trade policy later this year, exporters' body   said on Thursday. 

  Federation   president   also flagged various concerns owing to the implementation of the GST on India's shipments, especially owing to the proposed refund mechanism. The downward revision may be to the tune of around $700 billion as India's exports performance has been dismal in the last couple of years owing to global factors.
 
  "If we are looking at an export of $900 billion which was initially in the foreign trade policy, we record a compounded annual growth rate of around 27% and this is definitely a very challenging," Fieo director general   told reporters here. agencies
