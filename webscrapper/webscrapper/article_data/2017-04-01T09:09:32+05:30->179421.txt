HYDERABAD: A safe haven for wildlife in past, the famed peacock lake at   (UoH) could soon turn into a potential hazard for animals, say wildlife enthusiasts. 

 The peacock lake is situated well within the university premises and is one among the four major lakes.  , founder of  , a wildlife protection group on campus, alleged that huge amount of sewage enters the lake every day and is leading to collection of toxic sediments, which poses as a potential hazard for wildlife. 
 
 "Waste detergent water generated from washing synthetic courts in   stadium is entering the peacock lake. Most of the staff have stopped their morning walks in that helipad route due to foul smell. This is the only live lake in summer and the wildlife is dependent on it (sic)," said Jillapalli on Friday.
 
 According to a survey conducted by the Wild Lens team, there are over 200 species of birds, which includes number of peacocks apart from spotted deer, hare, rabbits, wild boars, monitor lizards and mongoose inside the university habitat. The peacock lake is one of the lakes on campus which are being considered for rejuvenation under a bio-reserve plan outlined by the university.
 
 While the blueprint of rejuvenating the lake was made in 2015, students claim that repeated complaints on polluting lakes has fallen on deaf ears. 
 
  "The students have never approached us. If students approach us with the matter, we will look into the same," said P Thukaram, deputy registrar and sanitation and horticulture head at the UoH.
