NOIDA: A   student has been apprehended for allegedly raping his neighbour’s four-year-old daughter after luring her to his house in Sector 73. The 14-year-old   was produced before the   Justice Board on Tuesday, which sent to a remand home in Phase II.

 Police said the crime took place around 4pm on Monday when both the teenager and the girl were alone at home. Seeing the girl alone, the boy lured her with toffees to his house and then sexually assaulted her.
 
 While the parents of both the boy and the girl were at work at the time, her elder sister had also stepped out of the house for a while. Both the families lived opposite each other in rented accommodation in a village in the sector, cops said.
 
 The girl returned home on her own in the evening, but complained of pain in her private parts when her mother came back from work. She finally narrated her ordeal to her parents after being coaxed by her mother. Cops were soon called.
 
 The girl was taken to district hospital for a medical examination, where it was confirmed that she was sexually assaulted. Subsequently, the boy was picked up. “The parents of both the children are migrant labourers,” Uday Ram, a Sarfabad resident, told TOI.
 
 Sector 49 SHO Pankaj Pant said the boy was at home as he had not gone to his school in Sarfabad on Monday. “After getting information, we sent the girl for medical examination which confirmed carnal intercourse. The child is in pain but out of danger,” he added.
 
 A case has been lodged against the boy under Sections 377 (unnatural offences) of IPC and Section 3/4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). “He has been sent to a remand home,” Pant said.
