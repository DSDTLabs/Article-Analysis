AHMEDNAGAR: The accused in the Kopardi   was being led inside the   premises here for the hearing on Saturday, when four activists of the Shivaba Sangathana appeared and attacked him with knives.

  immediately intervened between the accused and the assailants, before taking the stabbed and bleeding accused into custody to prevent further such attacks.
 
 Three policemen were also wounded in the knife assault.
 
 Advocate Balasaheb Khopade, defence counsel for the accused, demanded more security cover for his client following the incident and has requested the court to transfer the case to another state.
 
 The next hearing in this case is scheduled to take place on April 17, 2017.
 
 Last year in July, a 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped and murdered by three men in   village in  's   district. The teenage victim had reportedly been mutilated, and local accounts suggest she was found with her hair pulled out, and hands and teeth broken. The brutal rape-and-murder case has sparked demonstrations all over the Maharashtra.
