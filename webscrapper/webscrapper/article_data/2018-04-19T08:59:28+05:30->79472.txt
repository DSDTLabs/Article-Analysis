PANAJI: Goan painter   will be awarded in a ceremony to be held on April 20 in New Delhi. This comes following the display of his work at the Print Biennale of India, an international exhibition of graphic prints, held in the national capital, in March.

 “When they invited me, I was surprised. I knew my work was selected for exhibition but I wasn’t expecting my name to be proposed for an award,” he said.
 
 Gurav has been selected in the ‘honorable mention’ category for his etching print. The title of the work is ‘party animal’ and reflects the eating habits of some Goans.
