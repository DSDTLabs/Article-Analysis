BATHINDA: A   and his wife tried to immolate themselves in   of Bathinda on Saturday. Sukhdish Singh doused himself with kerosene but was stopped from setting himself ablaze.

 Sukhdish had an altercation with his neighbour   over discharge of dirty water towards his house. He said discharge of water could damage the foundation of his house. He said, “I frequently asked Jagga to stop discharging water from his house after washing his buffaloes. I also made a police complaint saying Jagga and his sons   beat me and my wife Sunita on May 24, when we objected to them releasing dirty water towards our house. Police registered a case but did not take action. We decided to immolate ourselves but people saved us.”
 
 On the other hand, Jagga said Sukhdish assaulted them in the course of an argument. Talwandi Sabo SHO Jagdish Kumar said cases against both parties were registered on May 24 and no action was taken as the matter was not serious.
