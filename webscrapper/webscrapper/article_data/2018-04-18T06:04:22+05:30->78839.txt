You may no longer have to drive 370 mm to   or 200 km to Ambardi from Ahmedabad to experience a lion’s habitat. Gujarat’s forest department has pulled out a wildlife drawcard by proposing to set up a new ‘lion safari’ 25 km away near   (GIFT) city in Gandhinagar, and a tiger safari near   in   district.

 Environment and forest minister   confirmed that the proposals were made along with a new leopard safari in Mandvi taluka of Surat. “The state forest department has identified 400 hectares of land near GIFT city for a lion safari on the lines of the Devaliya and Ambardi interpretation zone,” he said.
 
 Sources in the forest department claim that the Indroda zoological park never had lions. They added that the new interpretation zone near GIFT city will be an open safari and one will be able to watch the lions from close quarters from a special minibus.
 
 
 
 The plan is to introduce two pairs of lions and their cubs. The forest department plans to ensure healthy population of chital, sambhar and blue bulls near the proposed safari,” says a senior forest official.
 
 The new proposal has been sent across to the   of India for approvals. Once given the go-ahead, the Gandhinagar safari will be the third lion safari in the state. “We already have forest land in these areas. Hence, acquiring land won’t be an issue,” said the senior forest official. The officials also claimed that work for a new tiger safari near Kevadia has already begun and that the land has also been identified.
