DEHRADUN: A student of   climbed on a more than 100-foot tall mobile tower, pressing the college authorities and the state government to provide better infrastructure on the campus else he won’t come down.
 
  The student climbed down the tower only after intervention of state higher education minister  , who assured that students’ demands would be looked into at the earliest.
  
  Speaking about his decision to climb the tower,  , a IIIrd year student, said, “Desperate situation requires desperate measure, and I just wanted to make sure that the authorities take note of our demands seriously.”
  
  Demanding an inquiry into accounts, students’ body alleged that despite the college was receiving sufficient fund, nothing had been done for the development of infrastructure.
  
  “Our college receives a lot of money under two budgets — principal and management —but the money is not being used in the development of the campus. The money is unaccounted for, and we want the government authorities to conduct a proper audit to find where the money is being spent,” said  , former general secretary, DAV College students’ body.
  
  Other demands of the students include verification of stock with all departments at regular intervals. “Stock checking is actually mandatory, despite that there has been no checking in some departments for years. Besides, we want the state government to completely take over the college, since the government as of now is involved partially,” added Thapliyal.
  
  
  DAV principal   told TOI, “The minister has asked us to look into the students’ demands, which we will do at the earliest. As far as the matter funding is concerned, I can only speak about the principal budget, which is being spent adequately on the college. Even I am unaware about the money, which is with the management. An audit can only be done at university or government level. We will look into students’ other demands as well.”
