CHANDIGARH: Former speaker of   assembly and senior   leader Kuldeep Sharma on Wednesday sought a complete ban on the RSS in the state to avoid divisive politics and communal violence.

 Sharma, who hails from Brahmin community, hinted at lodging a formal complaint against the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) chairman, its controller of examinations and chief minister   over an alleged derogatory question about Brahmins in an exam for junior engineers (JE) conducted by the commission on April 10.
 
 “So far as the JE exam question controversy is concerned, it was well planned. Khattar quietly approved the question paper and allowed it to be printed. Hence, we have decided to initially lodge a police complaint. If police fail to act, we will not mind approaching a Panchkula court to start criminal proceedings against the accused,” he said.
 
 Referring to the RSS, Sharma said it was involved in hatred politics in Haryana and its ideology was apparently the reason for the assasination of  , hence it should be banned with immediate effect. The former speaker was referring to the proposal of using vyayamshalas and public parks by the RSS for holding its shakhas. “We are a free country and each and every citizen knows his or her responsibility towards the community, society and country. We don’t need an organisation to teach us that,” Sharma said.
