GUWAHATI: The state government has cracked the whip on   reluctant to evaluate   of the Class XII  . 

 In a directive to college principals, the   has asked them to engage college teachers in   as it would be hard for schoolteachers alone to check the papers of around 2.5 lakh students taking the Class XII state boards.
 
 In the past, some college teachers had expressed reluctance to check the scripts as they said it would add to their teaching load.
 
 "All principals have been asked to engage college teachers in evaluating the answer scripts of the Class XII state boards so that the results can be announced at the earliest. If college teachers don't cooperate, it becomes difficult for schoolteachers to evaluate the papers," a senior official of the state higher education department said.
 
 Unlike other states, Class XI and XII is part of colleges in Assam. College teachers have long campaigned for de-linking of Classes XI and XII from colleges but to no avail. They want teachers from higher secondary schools to be engaged in the evaluation process since college classes have become hectic after introduction of the semester system. 
 
 "Students have to appear for semester exams every six months. So it becomes difficult for us to spend days evaluating board exam answer scripts," a college teacher said.
