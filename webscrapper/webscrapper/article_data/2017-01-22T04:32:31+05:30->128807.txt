MUMBAI: The   received a major jolt on Saturday when city its minority department chairman   resigned from all posts, including party membership. Along with him, several hundred Congress workers have resigned from their posts alleging injustice to Muslims in nomination for the   polls. 

 At a crowded meeting at   office on Saturday afternoon, Rayeen slammed senior state Congress leaders for ignoring Muslims. "For 32 years I served the party and in the past several years tried to bring the community closer to the party. But now I am leaving it because some communal elements with deep-rooted hatred for the Muslims don't want me to remain vocal and assertive," said Rayeen. 
 
 Calling Rayeen's resignation a hasty decision, Congress city unit president   said, "The district committees formed to choose nominations are yet to submit their reports. No final decision on the tickets has been taken. Rayeen should have waited for the final list," said Nirupam, adding that he wanted a ticket for his son, which was perhaps not coming.
