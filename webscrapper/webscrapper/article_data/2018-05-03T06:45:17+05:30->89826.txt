MUMBAI: Former chief minister and state   president Ashok   along with   general secretary Mohan Prakash visited Nanar on Wednesday to extend support to the agitation against the Rs 3-lakh crore refinery project in Ratnagiri district. 

 On April 30, a delegation of anti-Nanar project activists led by Ashok Walam had called on Congress president Rahul Gandhi who then asked Chavan to visit Nanar. 
 
 Chavan told villagers that both CM   and industries minister Subhash Desai have been misleading them. "Ten days ago, Desai had declared in the presence of Uddhav Thackeray that the notification for the land acquisition would be scrapped, but it remains on papers, since so far there are no instructions to the department for scrapping the notification," Chavan said.
 
 On the other hand, Chavan said the CM has declared that Desai has no powers to scrap the notification since all such powers are entrusted to the high power committee headed by the chief secretary. Chavan also drew the attention of villagers to the purchase of large tracts of land by people who are not residents of Konkan.
