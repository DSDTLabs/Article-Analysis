Nrityadhaam, a dance institute, has organised 
 , a performance where classical dance students will perform Kathak Taal-mala, a rhythmic dance performance, based on a concept by the dancer Pt. Mohanrao Kallianpurkar.

 Prerna Deshapnde, the organiser and kathak exponent says, “We organise a series of concerts throughout the year named Sam se sam tak, but this one is very close to my heart. I am excited since I learned it under my guru Rohini ji’s tutelage and now my students are going to perform under my choreography, which is a new form, but at the same time, maintaining the tradition and classism of the art form for the audience. We are also going to felicitate the renowned and senior dancers of Pune at the inauguration.”
 
 
  
  
 
 The performances of Taal-mala are going to be a blend of speed, control, grace, rhythm, technique and classicism. It depicts a unique dance piece with visual and intellectual beauty. The complete choreographed series of performances is a tribute to her gurus on Nrityadham’s 25th year.
 
  
  
 The dance event will also feature   choreographies by renowned artist and choreographer   (son of the late Odissi guru,  ) and his troupe Srjan Ensemble. Srjan will be performing a neo-classical innovated performance choreographed by Ratikant and guru   ji, both of which will be performed for the very first time in Pune. Kathak and dance critic   would also be a part of the show.
