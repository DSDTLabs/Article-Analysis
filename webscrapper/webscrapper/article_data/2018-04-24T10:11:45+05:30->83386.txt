JAIPUR: Academic council of   ( ) on Monday proposed to temporarily stop the admissions in the five year law, three year evening   and M.Ed from this year. 

 There have been controversies around the law courses in the university as the faculty was not permanent as per the   guidelines.
 
 Bhupendra Singh Shekhawat, public relation officer of the university, said that the decision taken was temporary and RU was not discontinuing the above mentioned courses but after the permission for the required teachers will be taken from the state government as per the directions of the Bar Council of India, then these courses will be resumed. But this decision will not affect the students in the current year. The decision will also be presented to the syndicate meeting which is scheduled on April 26. 
 
 However, some people are not very hopeful about the decision. “When the university is not been able to fill the sanctioned post, do you think they will be able to start this course again. We can say that these courses will not be started again. This is a shame for the entire state and RU, when they stopped a course which was started by them,” said a source.
 
 Other decisions in the meeting includes the fee hike of 10% in the university admission and examination from this year which is as per the decision taken in the Syndicate meeting held on June 23, 2015. For post-graduation courses, there have been a suggestion to change the ratio of the marks at the time of admission. At present, for PG courses 70% marks of entrance examination and 30% for academic background is looked into. But in the meeting it was suggested to make it a 50-50 ratio.
