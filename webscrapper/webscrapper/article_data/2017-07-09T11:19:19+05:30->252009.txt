  Giving insight of Shah Rukh's character, director Imtiaz Ali said, "  is a tour guide. He guides about a ton of people every day and takes them where they want, but personally, he is lost."
 
  "He has not found what he is seeking for, but every day in his life there are hundreds of people reaching where they want to reach, which is just a tourist location that he is not even bothered to look at. He doesn't know where he is going and yet, he is a tour guide," he added.
 
  Shah Rukh, who is touted as the king of romance in Bollywood, will be seen romancing Anushka Sharma in the movie. The character of the 'Raees' star is a take on one of Bollywood's veteran Dev Anand's most iconic roles Guide (1965), where the legendary actor had charmed the entire nation with his act.
