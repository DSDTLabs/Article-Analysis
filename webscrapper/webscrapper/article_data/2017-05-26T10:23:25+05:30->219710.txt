KALYAN: A 53-year-old man lost his life in a road rage case here on Wednesday night after two people pushed him off the   bridge. 

 Assad Sayyed, a resident of Nashik district, where he works as a manager at at developer’s firm, suffered serious head injuries and later died. 
 
 Police said Sayyed, along with his friends, Pawan Patil (45) and Jaywant Bhavsar (52), had gone to a Dombivli friend’s house for a birthday celebration. After attending the party, they were returning the same night at 9pm, when their car accidentally dashed an Activa.
 
 Patil, who was driving the car, apologised to the accused, but they abused them and overtook his car. Sayyed, who was seated next to Patil, came out of car, and asked both why they were making it an issue about when he had apologised, but both abused and pushed him. He fell below, from a height of 10 feet, and his head hit a stone.
 
 Sayyed’s friends came out of the car to nab the Activa riders but they fled. Patil and Bhavsar took the victim to a private hospital in Kalyan, where doctors referred him to   but he was declared brought dead. 
 
 Police have registered a case against two persons under sections 304 (2), 342 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and have formed two teams to search for the accused. 
 
 Dilip Surywanshi, senior police inspector of Bazarpeth police station, said, “The accused have not been identified as the victim forgot to note down the two-wheeler’s number, but we are checking nearby CCTV cameras.” Surywanshi added, “We have called for an expert to prepare a sketch of the accused.”
 
 The incident has shocked his relatives and friends. “I am shocked as we did not think that a minor dispute would take the life of our friend,” Bhavsar told TOI. He added, “All happened suddenly, before we could come out of the car, the accused pushed Sayyed and fled.” 
 
 Relatives claimed his body and took it to Nashik for the final rites after a post-mortem on Thursday afternoon.
