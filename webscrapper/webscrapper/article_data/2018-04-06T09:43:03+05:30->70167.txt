BHOPAL: A two-day ‘Nyay Yatra’ of state Congress began from Udaipura town in Raisen district on Thursday. The yatra is being led by state Congress chief Arun Yadav and leader of opposition in the state assembly Ajay Singh.

 Udaipura is the hometown of PWD minister Rampal Singh, whose son Girijesh is being accused of abetment of suicide after a girl Priety Raghuvanshi, who lived in the neighbourhood of minister’s house, committed suicide after Girijesh got engaged to another girl. Girl’s kin alleged Priety and Girijesh had got married and under pressure from his family, he had not been accepting her as wife. Congress has since been demanding FIR against minister and his son for abetment of suicide.
 
 Speaking at a public meeting during launch of the yatra, Yadav said that goons have highjacked power in the state under Shivraj rule. “They have become so fearless that women/girls are being abducted, raped, and molested. MP for quite sometime has been on top in respect of crimes against women and is often dubbed as rape capital of country”, he said. Congress party’s “Nyay Yatra” is aimed at highlighting the  , farmers, youths, labourers and weaker sections of society and fight for justice to them. Referring to Priety Raghuvanshi’s suicide, Yadav said 20 days after her suicide, FIR has not been registered in the case nor the minister and his son have recorded their statement over the issue.
