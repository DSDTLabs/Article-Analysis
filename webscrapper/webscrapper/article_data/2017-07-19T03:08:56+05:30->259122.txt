LUCKNOW: A day after TOI reported that no trace of powerful plastic explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate was found in the white powder recovered from the UP assembly on July 12, the state home department said on Tuesday that the final result about what the substance was would be known on Thursday.

 Four days ago, chief minister   had cited an initial forensic report from a lab in Lucknow to say that the substance was PETN. He had said that some anti-national elements tried to trigger a deadly blast inside the assembly during the session.
 
 In a statement issued on Tuesday, the home department said the onus of examining the suspicious powder lies with Lucknow’s Mahanagar laboratory.
 
 The UP government has asked Mahanagar forensic laboratories director   to get detailed analysis of the powder done at the earliest.
 
 Inspector general of Anti-Terrorist Squad Asim Arun and home secretary (IPS) Bhagwan Swarup Srivastava said the investigators were concerned about the final outcome and not about where the test was being held.
 
 “We asked Upadhyay to use the best resources available with the experts and let us know the final status at the earliest. For us, proper examination of exhibit holds more value than the place where it is conducted,” said Arun.
 
 He added that   (NIA) may take up the matter in the next few days. “The state government had already recommended   probe into the matter. Our priority is to ensure that people responsible for breaching the security are identified,” said Arun.
