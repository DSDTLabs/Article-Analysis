NOIDA:   is all set to meet and apprise UP excise and prohibition minister   on Thursday (Feb 1) on host of pending civic issues in FONRWA office. These include separate maintenance division under Noida authority, treatment of solid waste management, upgrading district Gautam Budh Nagar to a police commissionerate with increased police force to a check on increasing crimes in district, enhancement of fire brigade force, a curb on stray dog menace, rampant encroachment and periodical visits of authority staff to residential sectors to address civic issue.

 “We have sought time with minister Jai Pratap Singh for Thursday (Feb 1) and got it where we will be apprising the minister on all pending civic matters raised by us in previous meetings with authority CEO   as well as chief secretary   recently,” N P Singh president Federation of Noida Residents Welfare Associations (FONRWA) told TOI.
 
 According to Singh the   as mentioned above have been in a state of limbo for quite some time despite fruitful meetings with CEO Tandon as well as chief secretary Kumar earlier this month. “We need to address pending issues such as that of separate maintenance division under Noida authority and the modalities under which it will function. We also need to address the issue of freehold property for all residents of Noida which no one seems to address in a concrete way. We will bring all this up before minister Singh and expect to get a definite action plan on these,” said Singh.
 
 Earlier this month on Jan 15, the RWA federation had held a fruitful meeting with chief secretary Rajive Kumar where the said civic issues including that of stray dog menace were addressed with timelines attached to some of them. “The response from both authority CEO Tandon and chief secretary Kumar had been very positive earlier as they assured resolution of pending matters. We will take forward from those meetings and apprise minister Singh on Thursday for their resolution,” said Singh.
