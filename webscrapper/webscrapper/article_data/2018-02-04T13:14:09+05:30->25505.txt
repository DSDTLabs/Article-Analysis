CHANDIGARH: For coming out of what is said to be its worst   yet, the   of Chandigarh has decided finally to   its big property   for the past many years.

 The civic body has announced to hold auction for 107 built-up booths located at   village on February 15. The municipal corporation has decided to auction this property on leasehold basis for 99 years. The public sale will be held at the conference hall of the corporation’s building in Sector 17.
 
 Sources in the corporation claimed that the civic authorities were in the process of identifying all the property that could be sold immediately, auctioned, or given out on rent, so that the civic body can get a good amount of money to run its affairs.
 
 Significantly, since the municipal corporation doesn’t have much hope from the Chandigarh Administration that it will spare enough money as grant-in-aid, the civic body is searching for all possible means to add to its revenue and become self-sufficient.
