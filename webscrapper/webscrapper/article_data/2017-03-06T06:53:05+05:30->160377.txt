 The original Raj Bhavan quarters constructed in 1956 with load bearing structures and lime concrete had become dilapidated and unusable and required construction of new quarters for officers and staff members working there.
 
 A total 152 flats have been constructed over 2.70 acres with A-Type, B-Type and CType quarters. Apart from residential quarters, a school building, community hall and barracks for security staff are also being constructed on the premises. This will be completed in a couple of months.
 
 The foundation for the construction of the residential quarters was laid on February 17 last year and the construction was completed in record time of 13 months.
 
 The entire project was designed with `green building concept' in mind. Green cover has been planned over an area spread over 20% of the total premises. Parking facility has been provided in stilt floor in all three types of quarters. The same quality has been main tained for flooring, doors, windows, and furnishing in all types of quarters.
 
 A unique feature is that entire power supply will be met through roof-top solar systems erected on each building.While water conservation has been taken care of with rain water harvesting pits and bore recharging pits, sufficient fire safety measures have been incorporated in the building construction. The water board has made provision for supply of treated water for gardening, according to a press note.
