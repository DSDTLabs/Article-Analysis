NOIDA: Police patrolling in the city remained partially affected for the second day on Tuesday as drivers of PCR vans sourced from private agencies continued with their strike against non-payment of salary for the past eight months.

 Some drivers, however, reported for work following requests from SHOs and in-charges of police outposts. The drivers who continued with the strike gathered near the Sector 29 police chowki and then outside the SP (City)’s office, seeking a solution to the dispute over working hours that have stalled their payment for months.
 
 The PCR van drivers have alleged they haven’t got salaries for the past eight months ever since their shift timings were changed from 12 hours a day to eight hours. The private contractor responsible for supplying the drivers for the PCR vans on Tuesday sent a legal notice to Gautam Budh Nagar  , citing terms of an earlier agreement that said delay in payment will attract penalty.
 
 SSP Ajay Pal   said he had sent a proposal to get the salaries of 129 drivers approved by the  .
 
 “A detailed proposal has been sent to the CEO of Noida Authority so that salaries of the PCR van drivers can be cleared and law and order does not suffer. The Authority has been positive so far,” the SSP said.
