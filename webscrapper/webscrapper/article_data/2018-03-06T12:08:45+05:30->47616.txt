The four women at the centre of the novel meet in their childhood during the mid seventies and develop special bonds. Even when they are far away from each other, their souls stay connected. A story of growth and bonding, the novel shows each of the women trying to follow their own destiny, desperately holding on to the past, battling abuse and fiercely determined to rise above the mess. The book stresses the urgency to raise one's voice against the silent abuses that have subjugated women for centuries. 

 Mankotia's book is a beautifully articulated exploration into the world of four friends who find their expression through solidarity. The author, through the novel, seeks to find a common ground for women who have suffered abuse in various guises, and wants them to free themselves from the clutches that have silenced them forever. A simple read, 
  is layered with evocative language and a charming plot.
