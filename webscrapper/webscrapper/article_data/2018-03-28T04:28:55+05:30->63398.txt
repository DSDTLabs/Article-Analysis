MUMBAI: Harbour Line services to Goregaon are likely to take off with an inaugural run on March 29. Regular services are expected to start from next week. "Dates are not finalised yet, but the inaugural run will happen this week," said an official. 

  A senior CR official said, "A total of 42 Harbour Line services will be operated between   and Goregaon. However, seven services will operate between Churchgate and Goregaon on the WR corridor." 
 
  ( ), the implementing agency of the project, had hoped to commission the services up to Goregaon by June 2014. It was later revised to December 2017, but this date too changed as some structures had to be cleared to lay the tracks near Goregaon. Once the line is extended, WR plans to extend some of its Churchgate-Andheri services till Goregaon. A total of 65 services currently operate between Churchgate and Andheri. More Goregaon services mean commuters from Jogeshwari, Ram Mandir and even Malad will benefit. If a significant number of commuters from Malad-Goregaon shift to Goregaon locals, it will spell relief for Borivali and   commuters. The Railways may even extend the Panvel-Andheri service up to Goregaon later, said an official.
