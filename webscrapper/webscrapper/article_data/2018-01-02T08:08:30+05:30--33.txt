 ( ): Hawaldar Jagdish  , a cook in  , showed exemplary courage during the terror attack on   air force base when he killed a terrorist with his bare hands before laying down his life for the country. 

 Like their brave and selfless father, Chand's daughters too are displaying a different sort of courage in his native remote village of Chamba district in  . Never interested in money or job for themselves, they have been demanding basic amenities for their remote village in order to make girls' life easier.
 
 Their native Basa village has no road connectivity, no internet facilities and no health facilities. Chand's elder daughter  , 25, said even though conditions were tough, she completed her BEd this year while her younger sister Tamana, 20, is pursuing graduation.
 
 "Our village has no modern facilities like internet which are required for studies. There are no roads to our village. We have to trek for 2 kms to get a bus on the link road. But we fulfilled the wish of our father, who had asked us to pursue education at any cost," Kiran said that it is not possible for girls to reach school and colleges during rainy seasons. They help their mother  , 47, in running the household.
