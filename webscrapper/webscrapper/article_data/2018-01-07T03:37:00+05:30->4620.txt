Nagpur: ‘Sarasar’, a play staged by Lalit Kala Bhavan in the 65th drama competition at Kamgar Kalyan Bhavan, Raghuji Nagar, on Friday, is a story of the betrayal of a girl who marries a young man in the rush of blood only to end up like a dream gone sour.

 Based on true life story, the play revolves around 18-year-old Sarita who goes steady with Ram. The couple has secret hangouts where they exchange sweet talks and confront each other as most teenagers madly in love do. Then she elopes with Ram in the hope of finding her own heaven. 
 
 As the play unfolds, Sarita gets the shock of her life when she comes to know that Ram is not his real name. He is Rahim who tricks girls with decent background into marriage and forces them to convert to his faith. She also realizes that Rahim is into human trafficking. 
 
 Though Ram aka Rahim truly starts caring for Sarita, he realizes that the love would be against his religion and forcibly converts her to Islam and gives her a new name — Sakina.
 
 One day, the police catch agents of human trafficking and rescue Sarita. But Rahim manages to give cops a slip. Months later, Rahim approaches Sarita again and convinces her to start life afresh. Blinded by love and not learning from the past mistake, Sarita elopes with him again. They reach Nagpur to catch a train, but Rahim leaves her on the platform despite her repeated pleas not to do it.
 
 Shocked by betrayal once again, Sarita becomes a mental patient and is admitted to a hospital for treatment.
 
 The lead roles were played by Ajinkya Aney, Ankita Nimsatkar and Karishma Rarokar. Written by Pravin Khapre, the play was directed by Aney.
