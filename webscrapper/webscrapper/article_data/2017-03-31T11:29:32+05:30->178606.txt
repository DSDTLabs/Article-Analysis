 The album was a lyrical version of the Valmiki Ramayana in Marathi which was presented by Renuka Deshkar along with various singers who performed some of the selected songs from the album. The songs were originally written by Gajanan Digambar Madgulkar and Sudhir Phadke composed the music for it. It consists of 56 songs chronologically describing events from Ramayana.
