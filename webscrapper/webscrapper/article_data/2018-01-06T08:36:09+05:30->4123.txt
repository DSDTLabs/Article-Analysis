CHARMINAR: Commuters are facing a lot of inconvenience due to   at crossings near   and the road that leads to Pathergatti. 

 While traffic jams are a common sight due to these non-functional signals, the problem exacerbates during morning and evening hours, motorists said. Some of the traffic lights don't function at all while others malfunction, commuters said.
 
 "The worst-affected are students and office-goers as the non-functional traffic signals cause huge traffic snarls during peak hours. There is no regulation of traffic in the entire stretch from Purdah Gate to Pathergatti," Prakash Singh, a mechanic-cum-shop owner of the area, said.
 
 "There is total chaos here. The non-functional traffic lights have also led to road accidents several times. At times, cops are seen managing the traffic, but most often, they are not there, "  , another commuter said. Traffic snarls during peak hours leave commuters frustrated but the officials concerned appear to have turned a blind eye. Additional commissioner of police   said that he will verify the matter.
