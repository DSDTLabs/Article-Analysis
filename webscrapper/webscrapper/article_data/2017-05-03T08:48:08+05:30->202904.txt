COIMBATORE: A man from   near Sulur staged a sit-in in his village on Tuesday, seeking to open a Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation (Tasmac) liquor outlet. But, he withdrew the protest as it didn't evoke any response from other residents. 

 M Subramaniam of Karanampettai in   staged the sit-in, urging the government to open the wine shop at Karanampettai to favour the drunkards.
 
 Two tasmac shops (number 1928 and 2263) were shut in the area last month following the Supreme Court order, forcing many drunkards from Karanampettai village to travel more than 3-5km to consume liquor.
 
 So, people addicted to alcohol had been demanding the government to set up a shop in the village. Carrying a placard, Subramaniam sat on protest on Tuesday, expecting others to join him. But, no one turned up. 
 
 He sat for 10 minutes and withdrew the protest.
