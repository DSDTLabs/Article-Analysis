CHANDIGARH: The municipal corporation here was in for embarrassment when it failed to kick off its planned programme for collection of segregated waste at source level in Sector 48.

 Significantly, the civic body had planned the programme with much fanfare, but since the sanitation employees had been on strike, it failed to start this initiative. The event was to be launched by municipal commissioner   in the presence of area’s municipal councillor and former city’s deputy mayor  . Sources in the MC revealed that since Sector 48 had numerous housing societies, the MC thought of starting the said exercise from there by assuming that the area would be manageable.
 
 On the other hand, due to the strike the residents found themselves at the receiving end as it was the second day when   was not picked from their houses.   of Sector 20 said that, “The strike is causing us trouble as garbage is lying outside our houses. On Wednesday, we were unaware that the sanitation staff had given a call for strike, it was only on Thursday that we came to know that they had gone on an indefinite strike.”
 
 Another resident Pradip Chugh of Sector 35 said that, “The situation is grave as most of us do not know where to drop the waste generated from households in case the sanitation staff doesn’t come to collect the garbage. They must sort out their resentment with the MC so that residents don’t have to face the trouble.”
 
 President of door-to-door garbage collection society   said that, “Our demand is that our wages must be increased as these it have not been revised for a long time. If our demand is not taken care of, we will continue our strike.”
 
  of Sector 22 said that, “The strike must end soon as garbage from households has started to rot. People have dumped them in corners, which is not only emanating foul smell but has also become a health hazard.”
