AGRA: Students of nearly 165 primary and upper primary schools in Agra city may soon have to go hungry as   have not been released for the past five months. Teachers say that they have been arranging money for providing midday meals in the past few months but have now expressed their inability to carry on further. They say local shopkeepers are now refusing to provide rations and other items on credit.
 
  When TOI contacted an education official and asked him about the issue, he refused to comment. According to official sources, school heads of primary schools are allotted Rs 4.13 per student and Rs 6.18 for students in upper primary schools. Before July 1 last year, the cost was Rs 3.86 for each primary school student and Rs 5.78 student of upper primary schools.
  
  Head teacher at   at Nala Budaan Sayed Rajeev Verma said, “We have not received the funds from the past six months and we are not sure when we will get the money. In most of the schools, teachers are paying from their pockets so that students get midday meals in schools.”
  
   , another head teacher of a school, informed that local shopkeepers have now refused to give rations on credit. “We have been assuring them that payments would be made next month, but due to the delay in release of funds, we cannot give them the exact date when payments would be made.” Shah added that if there is a delay in fund allotment, officials concerned should arrange grocery and other items so that the scheme is not affected.
  
   , another teacher, said, “I am paying the vegetable vendor from my own pocket.”
  
  BSA   refused to discuss the matter and said teachers may contact him.
