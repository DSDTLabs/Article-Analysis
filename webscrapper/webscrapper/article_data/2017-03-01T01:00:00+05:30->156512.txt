 The actor, who won accolades for his villainous role in  , is not only expanding the boundaries of action in films but also making the most of the roles coming his way. In his upcoming release,  , Vidyut will be back at what he does best — action. “In Commando, we had explored possibly everything that can be done in an action film. So, when this film was announced, people kept asking me what else is left,” says Vidyut. One look at the trailer is enough to tell you that the stunts in the second instalment of this franchise are a notch higher.
 
  
 “Last time people saw me doing a somersault over the car, so this time I squeeze in below the car,” he laughs. Of course, with great action comes a greater chance of injury. Ask him how many broken bones he has and pat comes the reply, “I don’t have   on my body but a dozen of   and stitches. Those are my tattoos.” He also informs that the action that viewers will see in Commando 2 is as real as it gets. “We had signed a contract that we won’t fake the fight scenes. So when you see me hitting people, I am actually 
 hitting them and vice-versa,” Vidyut adds.
 
 
  
 Though the actor does stunts by himself and considers injury and risk a part of his work, he isn’t against the idea of using body doubles. “Why not,” he asks, adding, “If you can’t do it, it’s good to have a double. In my case, I would love to have a body double do my stunts, but the kind of height, body and skill I have, we can’t find one for me. I have been looking desperately for one.”
 
 
  
 Vidyut is confident about his skills and feels that there’s no equal to him in the industry. However, the mention of Tiger Shroff interests him. “I think me and Tiger would be great together. He is a good martial artist and I would love to do a film with him,” he says. Well, wouldn’t that be a treat for the action aficionados?
