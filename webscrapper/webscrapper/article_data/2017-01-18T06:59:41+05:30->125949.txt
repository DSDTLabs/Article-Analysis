HYDERABAD: Five peacocks were found dead at an open plot in   at   on Tuesday afternoon. Following complaints from residents, officials from the Telangana state forest department sent the carrion of the birds for postmortem to a veterinary hospital in Hayathnagar. 

 "Going by the preliminary report of the postmortem, it is suspected that the birds were poisoned. We collected the viscera of the birds and will be conducting an inquiry to identify the culprits," Dr S N Kukrety (IFS), chief conservator of forests,  , told TOI. The department is in possession of the preliminary offence report (POR), he said.
 
 He added that the national bird is protected under schedule one of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Killing a peacock is a serious offence and the offender can be jailed for three to seven years, with a fine up to 25,000 being imposed, or both, Kukrety said. "After we narrow in on the culprits, we will push for the punishment based on the extent of their involvement in the crime," he said. 
 
 Officials from the department suggested the culprits might have killed the peacocks for their feathers. Photos of the carcasses show the birds without their plume. When calls about the birds were received by officials, they initially suspected they were killed for their meat.
