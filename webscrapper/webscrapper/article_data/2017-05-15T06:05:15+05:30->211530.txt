SRINAGAR: Two days after   commander   alias   warned   separatists against calling Kashmir struggle a political issue and threatened to slaughter them, Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq and   on Sunday pleaded with the militants to not get emotional and instead follow “freedom struggle with vision and wisdom”.

 The spat between Hurriyat separatists and Hizb militants has created debate in the Valley. In a joint statement Geelani, Mirwaiz and Yasin asked all political and militant organisations to maintain unity. 
 
 “Our freedom movement is in its crucial stage and we need to be careful as our enemy can derive advantage from prevailing crises,” the joint Hurriyat statement said, adding that in the 1990s, “We paid a lot in terms of lives... Disunity and differences proved disastrous.”
 
 Meanwhile, Zubair Ahmad Turray, a regular stone pelter from   in south Kashmir, who recently escaped jail, announced he was joining Hizbul Mujahideen in a video clip.
