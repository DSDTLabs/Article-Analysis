TRICHY: Founder of Latchiya Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, T   on Tuesday criticised the   rescue padayatra being undertaken by DMK working president M K   as a farcical one. 

 The actor-turned-politician accused the DMK government led by M Karunanidhi of withdrawing the case over Cauvery water. “DMK withdrew the case in the Cauvery issue in 1969, and was hand-in-glove with the   in signing the methane and hydrocarbon projects. They only mortgaged the rights of Tamil Nadu. Now, he (Stalin) is taking out Cauvery rescue padayatra. It is farcical,” Rajendar told reporters at the Trichy International Airport. 
 
 He also accused the Congress for its double standard in constituting the   (CMB). “The Congress government in   is hell bent against the formation of the CMB. The irony is that the Congress party in Tamil Nadu is joining hands with the DMK here. They have dual standards,” alleged Rajendar.
 
 Rajendar also charged the DMK of having a secret pact with the EPS-OPS led AIADMK government. “I will tour the entire Tamil Nadu to expose the DMK,” he said.
 
 He expressed hope that the issue over Cauvery water would reach a solution after the elections are over in Karnataka.
