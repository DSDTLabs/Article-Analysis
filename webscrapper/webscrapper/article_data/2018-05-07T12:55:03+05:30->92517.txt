COIMBATORE: Farmers from across 14 districts in   have requested the Union and state government not to erect high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission towers on agricultural fields. Instead, they want the government to lay underground cables along roads to carry electricity.

 The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and state government’s Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited are planning to erect transmission towers on agriculture lands in 14 districts to carry electricity to Thrissur in Kerala, Thiruvallam in Vellore, Edayarpalayam and Arasur in Coimbatore and many areas from Pugulur HVDC sub-station. The towers will be erected in 14 districts including Karur, Erode, Namakkal, Salem, Coimbatore, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Thiruvannamalai, Dindigul and Tirupur. 
 
 Farmers from 14 districts have formed a federation to stop the installation of towers on agriculture fields. The federation convened a meeting in Erode on Sunday.
 
 The state government is going to acquire farm lands to install the towers and it would affect the livelihoods of the farmers in the 14 districts, RV  , a farmer, told TOI. “The Power Grid Corporation of India Limited is planning to erect towers from   to Coimbatore district. From Coimbatore district border to Thrissur, it plan to use underground cables. We won’t allow the project,” he said.
 
 The federation passed a resolution in the meeting, which it plans to send to the state and Union government.
