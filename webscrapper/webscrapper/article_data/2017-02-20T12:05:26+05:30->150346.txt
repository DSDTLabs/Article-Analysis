BENGALURU: Having splurged Rs 12 crore on   at the IPL player auction in Bengaluru on Monday to bolster their bowling unit after the last-minute pull out  ,   chairman   felt the England pacer will add balance to their squad.

 "We needed a good fast bowler after Mitchell Starc pulled out in the last minute," Thomas said. "Mills was a good buy and we are satisfied with it. Our focus is on the home games and we believe Mills will suit to our home conditions and add balance into the squad," he said adding that they were keen on the player.
 
 Thomas said Australian pacer Starc's last-minute decision to opt out of IPL did not hamper their plans. "When we have international players in the squad we should be ready for such situations. The decision to part ways was mutual given their workload at international cricket. We only followed the IPL regulations that are in place," he added.
 
 On teams not showing interest on India's premier pacer Ishant Sharma, Thomas said: "Sharma is one of the top pacers in the country. He is doing well. All teams will have their strategies and will be focusing on home games. The unsold players will still comeback into the auction pool in the second half of the day, so still there are chances," he said.
 
 On buying Delhi left-arm spinner Pawan Negi for Rs 1 crore, Thomas said: "Our focus was on bowling options. Negi is a good bowling all-rounder and he will fit into our strategies."
