NEW DELHI: The once vaunted opening Indian attack of Gambhir and Sehwag today again launched a blistering attack - off the field - to take on those who abuse India's armed forces.

 Indian opening batsman   said on Twitter that "for every slap an Indian soldier faces...at least a 100 jihadi lives" must be taken. V
 
  
  
 
 irendra Sehwag said "there's a limit to misbehaviour" against the armed forces.
 
 
  
  
 Both were responding to a video - the authenticity of which cannot be verified by TOI - allegedly showing paramilitary jawans being kicked and abused by a section of people, allegedly in Kashmir.
 
 As he batted strongly for Kashmir, Gambhir said "our flag also stands 4: saffron - fire of our anger, white - shroud for jihadis, green - hatred 4 terror."
 
 
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
 Gambhir also railed against those demanding "azadi" saying they should leave India immediately.
 
 The batsman has of late been tweeting about things not cricket.
 
 Last month too, he spoke in favour of the  , but at the same time defended Delhi University student  , who had posted a pro-peace message and was not just mocked for it but hounded. There were also rape threats against her.
 
 Gambhir strongly supported Gurmehar.
 
 "I have the utmost respect for the Indian Army. Their service to the nation and all of us is unmatched. However the recent events have left me with a sense of disappointment. We live in a free country where everyone is entitled to their opinion. If a daughter who lost her father puts up posts about the horrors of war with the intention of achieving peace, she has all the right to. It is not an opportunity for everyone to show how patriotic they are and gang up on her to mock her. She is entitled to her opinion just as every other citizen is. Everyone may or may not agree with it but mocking her for it is despicable," he said.
