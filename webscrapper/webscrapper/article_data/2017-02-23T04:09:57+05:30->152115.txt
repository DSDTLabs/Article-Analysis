AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court on Wednesday remanded J P Singh, the then joint-director of Enforcement Directorate (ED) and three others to five-day custodial interrogation on charges of bribery in multi-crore IPL cricket-betting scam.

 The CBI has arrested 2000-batch Indian Revenue Service officer Singh, the investigator of the betting scam  , Delhi’s resident   and a local person Chandresh Patel. While producing the accused before the court, CBI sought 10-day remand on the ground that they were not co-operating with investigation.
 
 The defence lawyers   and   objected the remand application and maintained that their clients remained present before the investigators for more than a week, whenever they were summoned. Advocate Barot claimed that the arrests were made in order to suppress two cases – IPL cricket betting racket and the hawala scam involving Surat-based businessman Afroz Hasanfatta, which were initiated by Singh when he was head of ED in Ahmedabad.
