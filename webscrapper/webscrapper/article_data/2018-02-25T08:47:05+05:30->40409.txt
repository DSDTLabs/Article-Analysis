BENGALURU: The attempt-to-murder case against   and his associates till now rests only on the complaint lodged by the friend of the victim,   L, as police are yet to record the latter’s statement. Legal experts say Vidvat’s statement will be crucial to the probe.

 Praveen Venkatachalaiah had on February 17 night lodged a complaint that his friend, Vidvat, was assaulted by   and his aides at a restaurant in UB City. Though police first registered an FIR for criminal intimidation and other charges, IPC’s Section 307 (attempt to murder) was added later.
 
 Under Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC ), Vidvat’s statement can be recorded under sections 161 and 164. Under Section 161, a police officer records the statement, while under Section 164, a magistrate does it.
 
 “Vidvat’s statement will be pivotal to the case. If it implicates the accused persons or if his his health condition deteriorates, it would only make the case stronger against the accused,” said Ashok Haranahalli, a former   advocate-general who was also a CBI counsel in the Karnataka high court.
 
 Senior advocate Ravi B Naik feels that considering Vidvat’s medical statement, recording his statement is not possible as of now. He seconded Haranahalli by saying that Vidvat’s statement is vital.
 
 P Prasanna Kumar, special public prosecutor for CBI, said it is surprising that police have not taken Vidvat’s statement yet. “Any statement by Vidvat will have a definite bearing on the case. Either, under section 161 or section 164, statement of the victim/injured would be crucial for the prosecution along with the statement of eyewitnesses and medical evidence. This would also help the court in ascertaining the role of each accused,” he told TOI.
