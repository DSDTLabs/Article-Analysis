PATNA: Bihar   ( ) vice-president   on Tuesday resigned from the party post after his name surfaced in a   lodged by the daughter of a former minister of the same party.

 “Pandey sent a letter to BPCC president Ashok Choudhary on Tuesday, expressing his intention to resign from the party post on ‘moral ground’. The BPCC chief has accepted his resignation,” state   spokesperson Harkhu Jha told TOI.
 
 Police said Pandey has been booked under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) after his name surfaced in the case.
 
 “My name did not figure either in the FIR lodged by the girl or in her statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC. Had I been involved in the matter, the girl should have mentioned my name in the FIR or during her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC. My name was deliberately cropped at later stage as part of a well-knit conspiracy,” Pandey said in his letter. 
 
 Police said Pandey’s name has been included in the case along with main accused Nikhil Priyadarshi, a car dealer, who is currently absconding. Praiyadarshi is son of a retired IAS officer   Sinha. The girl has alleged Priyadarshi, his father Sinha and a few of his friends, sexually exploited her.
