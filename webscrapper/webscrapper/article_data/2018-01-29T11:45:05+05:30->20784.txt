All that glittered at the 60th annual   was  ' '24K Magic'. The R&B singer took home a total of six awards including Album Of The Year, Record Of The Year and Song Of The Year. Following close behind on the list was Rapper  , who walked away with five wins of his own including Best Rap Album, Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. British singer and songwriter  , who was snubbed out of major categories, won the Grammy for Best Pop Vocal Album for 'Divide' and Best Pop Solo Performance for the album's single 'Shape of You'. Sheeran however, was not present to receive the awards.

 Apart from some big wins, the show boasted to stellar performances through the night beginning with Kendrick Lamar's performance of 'XXX' from his album 'DAMN'. The show saw Brothers Osborne, Maren Morris and Eric Church perform 'Tears in Heaven' to pay tribute to victims of a mass shooting at a music fest in Las Vegas last year, and Elton John team up with Miley Cyrus for a 'Tiny Dancer' duet. The highlight of the night had to be Kesha's powerful performance of her hit single 'Praying' along with Cyndi Lauper, Camila Cabello, Julia Michaels, Day and a choir, all dressed in white.
 
 The hit track 'Despacito' by Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee and Justin Bieber didn't pick any of the three Grammys it was nominated for. Another big shocker was JAY-Z losing out on all the eight categories he was nominated for last night.
