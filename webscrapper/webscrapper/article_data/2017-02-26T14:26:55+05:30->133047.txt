Her family has been in the film business for almost a century (her great grandfather was the owner of Sri Murugan Talkies in Mint), but when it came to making her entry in films,   says that she had a tough time convincing her family members.   is making her debut, as Shakti  's pair in P Vasu's upcoming Sivalinga, which has Raghava Lawrence and Ritika Singh in the lead roles. 'Since childhood, I've wanted to be a heroine, having seen the films of actresses like Jayalalithaa, Meena and Jyotika. I had been telling the same to everyone, but when it was time to act in films, my family did not accept. They had thought that I wasn't seriously meaning to get into cinema. I cried and fought with them for a few days, and they finally relented,' recalls Saara.

 She plays a Brahmin girl, the daughter of a caterer (played by  ) in Sivalinga. Interestingly, she almost missed her chance to act in the film. 'By the time I approached the producer of the film, the team had selected another actress for this role. Luckily, a few days later, I got a call from them telling me that P Vasu sir wanted to see me. He has known me for a while because I had approached him a couple of years earlier. At that time, he had told me that I looked like a child. They were shooting near Bangalore then, and I went there. Vasu sir asked me to wait for a day, and then, told me that I will be part of the film,' she says.
 How comfortable was it acting alongside Shakthi, who is the director's son? 'On the set, Vasu sir never treated Shakthi like a son. They both behaved like an actor and a director. Even though we didn't talk much, I found Shakthi to be very dedicated,' says the girl, who is playing the female lead in the horror thriller Meendum Vaa Arugil Vaa.
