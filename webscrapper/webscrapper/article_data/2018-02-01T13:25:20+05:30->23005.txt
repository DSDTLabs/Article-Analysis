VADODARA: She was pushed by her husband – famous artist   – to pursue pottery when they moved to the city in 1951. But 92-year-old Ira Chaudhuri’s passion to create the art has anything but diminished. 

 Chaudhuri, an inspiration to young artists, is in city to exhibit her works at   from February 3.
 
 “These days I get lot of help and it bothers me if I do not make pottery. In fact, pottery work keeps me alive and it also keeps me going,” said Chaudhuri, who visits city every year during winters. 
 
 However, her current visit is a special one as she is keeping a promise she had made to late sculptor  . “Nagji Patel was very keen to have my exhibition here and I am only keeping a promise to him,” said Chaudhuri, who studied art at   of   in Santiniketan.
 
 Reminiscing her days of fine arts faculty of   before moving to Delhi in 1970, she said, “There is no department of pottery in the faculty but only an elective subject. In those days, we had got one potter in the faculty. I learnt pottery there as a non-collegiate student.” She then taught and held charge of pottery section at the faculty making earthenware glazed functional pots.
 
 “Earlier the upper-middle class was active in pottery and they too used to indulge in it as a hobby. However, now more artists have now taken it up despite the rise of ceramics art,” she added.
 
 After being active in pottery for more than six decades,   says, “After all these years I think I can now do what I want to.”
