KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan’s revival and new head coach Shankarlal Chakraborty’s ‘honeymoon’ lasted just one match. If the win over   had breathed some life into Mohun Bagan’s stuttering   campaign, a 1-2 defeat at the hands of   Punjab FC at the Salt Lake Stadium on Wednesday pushed them back to depths of despair.

 Chencho Gyeltshen, dubbed the Bhutanese Ronaldo, troubled the Bagan backline with his pace and guile, scoring a first-half brace to help his team notch up a big win. It helped Minerva go top of the table with 19 points from 8 matches, pushing East Bengal (18 from 9) to second place.
 
 
 Down 0-2 at half time, Bagan upped the ante in the second half and Eze Kingsley pulled a goal back in added-on time. Had Ansumana Kromah not missed a penalty in the 34th minute, the hosts could have salvaged at least a point. The truth, however, is that Bagan were woeful, especially in the first half.
 
 Wednesday’s loss — their second in three matches — kept Bagan on 13 points after 9 games and dealt a huge blow not only ahead of the Kolkata Derby against East Bengal on January 21, but also to their title hopes.
 
 If Bagan’s midfield in the second half of the Aizawl game had showed some improvement, it was back to square one on Wednesday. There was no organization, direction or planning in their play as the midfielders kept running about like headless chickens in the first half. Even Cameron Watson was off colour.
