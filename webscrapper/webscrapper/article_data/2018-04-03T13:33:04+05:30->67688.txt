VIJAYAWADA: Increasing petrol and diesel prices have become a major cause of concern for denizens. Diesel price touched the Rs 71.72-mark in Vijayawada on Monday which is an all-time high.

 Petrol, which cost Rs 78.29 on April 01, 2014, will now cost Rs 79.90. Fuel prices which fell in 2014 after general elections with the fall in crude oil prices in the global markets has gradually increased. “The Union government revised the excise duty on petrol and diesel almost six times till the end of 2016. Though crude oil prices fell, the benefit was passed onto the government from the customer and government revenue increased massively,” said   president R  .
 
 The Centre which reduced Rs 2 on excise duty last year requested the state government to reduce value added taxes and extra charges but no governments considered this so as to make money, he added.
 
 The government is collecting 22.25 per cent and an additional Rs 4 charges per litre as VAT on diesel. Similarly in petrol, the government is charging 30.25% plus Rs 4 on each litre of petrol which almost increased the price by 50 per cent, said Gopala Krishna.
 
 Filing stations in the city are recording poor sales in recent time with increase in prices. “Fuel stations usually notice poor sale in summer and this year and we are almost ending with loses as the petrol price has increased appreciably. Citizens are reducing their journey distances and consumption of fuel due to exorbitant prices,” said M  , manager at a fuel station in Ajith Singh Nagar.
 
 Denizens are expressing anguish over both state and union governments raising fuel charges. “The Modi government which introduced daily   revision system is successful in looting the common man. The government which increased the taxes when fuel prices were down in the market in the name of stabilisation, should now support the common man by reducing taxes,” demands K Bharat Kumar, a techie from city.
