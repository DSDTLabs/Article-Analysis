CHENNAI: The Madras   has directed the   municipal authorities to lock and seal an illegally constructed   and disconnect power and water connections to the premises.

 A division bench of Justices M Venugopal and S Vaidyanathan gave the direction on a plea moved by S Kamaladevi who lives in a property adjacent to the prayer hall.
