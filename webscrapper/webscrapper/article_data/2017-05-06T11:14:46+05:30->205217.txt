HYDERABAD: The Telangana government’s   to provide   to   has hit a hurdle, with many residents of the earmarked areas unwilling to move out. Most of them fear they may not get the pucca house after they give up their current homes.

 The Hyderabad district administration has identified 28 slums for the  . But so far only three slums — Jangampet (1.24 acres), Ghousenagar (one acre), Rasoolpura-Kattamaisamma (2.06 acres) — have been vacated to pave way for the new constructions.
 
 “Shifting of slum dwellers has become a tough task. Most of them are unwilling to move out as they have been staying there for almost five decades. They fear they will need to change their documents, including Aadhaar cards, once they shift and then change it again after the new houses are allocated. Also, these slums are within the city and some residents fear they will lose their homes entirely,” a senior official in the Hyderabad collectorate said.
 
 “We have no option other than bringing the issue to the notice of the MLAs concerned. We will begin the construction once the slum dwellers vacate the area. The tender process is also held up,” the official said.
 
 At a few places, slum dwellers vacated their houses following intervention of local legislators. Officials issued possession certificates to the slum dwellers soon after they shifted. New houses will be allotted only to those with such possession certificates. There will be a draw of lots on allotment. 
 
 Though the Hyderabad district administration is aiming to hand over the slums to GHMC by May, the delay in shifting of slum dwellers has affected the project.
