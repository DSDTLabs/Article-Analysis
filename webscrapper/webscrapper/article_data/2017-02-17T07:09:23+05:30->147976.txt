ETAWAH: CM Akhilesh   addressed a rally here on Thursday and tore into his estranged uncle   without once naming him. 

 “A person,”   said, tried to drive a wedge between father Mulayam Singh Yadav and him. This person did his best to snatch the party’s cycle symbol. He got left far behind. This first-of-its-kind attack was loaded with significance. 
 
 It was delivered in the heart of the Yadav stronghold, the family turf of Etawah, in an election where Shivpal loyalists are seen as sabotaging SP. This, after his nominees, incumbent MLAs in Etawah and Bharthana, were dropped. Shivpal is contesting the third Jaswantnagar seat. With the sabotage spectre looming, Akhilesh reminded voters that it was not “Kamlesh Katheria’s election (at Bharthana) but also “my election”.
 
  He asked: “Are there people hiding who also want to defeat me.” This direct assault appeared to deliver a blunt message to dissenting partymen: that his inheritance of the party mantle was irreversible. “The cycle was being snatched from us. But it’s with me…I pedalled faster and left those people behind,” he said. “Is there anyone who wants to stop the cycle? Maybe we don’t realise it, but he’s hiding amidst us,” Akhilesh said to wild guffaws from the crowd. Realising his father’s appeal in the home constituency and the view that they don’t share the best of ties, Akhilesh said, “There are people who stoke enmity just for vested interest… If SP wins, the person to gain the maximum respect will be Netaji.”
