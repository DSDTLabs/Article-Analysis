 — Bharatiya Janata Party’s ( ) ally at the state — has criticised the   presented by finance minister   on Wednesday and termed it as  .

 Sena’s Nashik unit president Ajay Boraste said after the harsh step of demonetisation, the people expected some relief for their businesses. “We do not think this Budget will give any boost to business activities. They shall continue to languish. The Budget is a total disappointment and has nothing in it for the common man,” he said.
 
 About the cap on political funding, Boraste said, “The cash limit of Rs 2,000 can be given in parts. If someone wants to give Rs 5 lakh they could give cash in installments of Rs 2,000 each. If they wanted transparency why didn’t they make the donations cashless? It’s nothing but a gimmick,” he stated.
 
 He added that in three years the Modi government failed to bring about economic growth and failed to keep its promises of unveiling Swiss Bank account holders, black money etc. “We are fed up of hearing announcements. People want change,” Boraste said.
 
 The Congress and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena refused to comment on the budget. However, BJP city president Laxman Savji said the budget was a new approach.
 
 “All future elements were considered in the Budget. This is not a temporary arrangement. The Budget was prepared with foresightedness and it was made considering every aspect of the society. The government took the working class, businesses, agriculture and women into consideration while preparing the Budget,” Savji said.
