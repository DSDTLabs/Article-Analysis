NEW DELHI:   Delhi Municipal   has issued a circular saying that anyone found   will be fined. 

 Congress leader and local councillor Abhishek Dutt slammed the move claiming that there is no basic infrastructure available and the corporation should first focus on giving services to the people.
 
 He said there are many areas like Ayanagar, Sangam Vihar, Ghitorni, etc, that have no public toilets and people are forced to urinate in public.
 
 “There are no public toilets in the rural belt and unauthorised colonies, slum clusters and JJ clusters. How will people use toilets when there is none?” he said.
 
 The civic body has decided to impose a   of Rs 50 on anyone who is seen   in public. “Each ward should have more than 10 toilets. But that is not the case,” he said. However, officials said there are about 1,100 toilet blocks and 300 more will come up.
