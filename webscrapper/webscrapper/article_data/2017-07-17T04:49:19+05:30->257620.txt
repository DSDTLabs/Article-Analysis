NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   said on Sunday that the central government has sent a strong advisory to all states to ensure strict action against   in the name of cow protection and sought the support of all political parties on this issue.

 In an unusually lengthy intervention at a meeting of all political parties ahead of the monsoon session of Parliament, the PM also sought their support for measures to combat corruption and said the issue must not be viewed in political terms. Opposition leaders were struck by Modiâ€™s outreach as he spoke for close to 25 minutes, a departure from his usual practice of making a few brief comments.
 
 Even after the meeting concluded, the PM went around the back benches and greeted party leaders.
