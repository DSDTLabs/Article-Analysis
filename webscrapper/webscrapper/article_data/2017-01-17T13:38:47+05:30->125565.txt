CHENNAI: Late   chief minister J  's niece   on Tuesday said she has decided to enter politics to fulfill her aunt's dreams. 

 "I can't see anyone in the place of Jayalalithaa. It was after talking to   cadre that I decided to enter politics," Deepa said at a press conference at her home in T Nagar here. 
 
 "There are two options -- one to join the AIADMK and the other, to launch a new party. I will take a call on it after talking to my supporters,” she said.
 
 Deepa said she would announce her decision on her aunt’s birth anniversary, on February 24.
 
 Asked whether she was scared of AIADMK general secretary V K sasikala, Deepa said, "I’m not scared of anybody, it is not my nature." 
 
 She avoided questions in connection with Sasikala. "I don't want to make any personal comment now. Cadre’s and people's decision is final," she said.
 
 Asked about her lack of experience in politics, Deepa said taking care of the welfare of the people is important, and not experience. "I will follow the footsteps of MGR and Jayalalithaa and I will work for the welfare of people. A number of schemes that Amma implemented should be reached to the right people. I will work for it," she said.
 
 Deepa's house in T Nagar witnessed huge crowd of supporters who were shouting slogans supporting the young leader.
