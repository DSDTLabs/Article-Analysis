RUDRAPUR: An indefinite hunger strike by a 30-year-old woman, who was allegedly molested by a government doctor at   district hospital recently, entered the third day on Friday with several women’s rights groups and political leaders offering support to her.
 
  On May 18, police registered a case against  , an orthopaedic surgeon at Rudrapur district hospital, for allegedly molesting a 30-year-old woman during medical examination. The husband of the woman allegedly thrashed the doctor after she narrated the incident to him. However, the doctor had refuted all the charges claiming that the allegations were baseless. Police also filed a counter case against the victim’s husband for assaulting Chauhan.
  
  Talking to TOI, the woman said, “The government talks about ‘beti bachao, beti padhao’. However, when it comes to crimes against women, they turn a blind eye. Instead of taking action against the accused, police have arrested my husband. I will fast to death if the police do not arrest the doctor and release my husband.”
  
  Rudrapur BJP MLA Rajkumar Thukral met senior police officials on Thursday demanding the arrest of the doctor.
  
  Devendra Peencha, additional superintendent of police of US Nagar, said, “We are investigating the allegations against the doctor. The statement of the victim has been recorded already.”
  
  Meanwhile, doctors at the district hospital have threatened to go on strike if Chauhan is arrested. Dr RK Singh of district hospital said, “The allegations against the orthopaedic surgeon are baseless. He was just performing his duty. We stand with our colleague and will ensure that he gets justice.”
