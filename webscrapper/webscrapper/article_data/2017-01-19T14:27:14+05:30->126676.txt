VISAKHAPATNAM: The Rs 3,000-crore proposal to expand   from four to six lanes gained momentum with the completion of the survey. 

 NHAI project director Srinivasa Rao told TOI that the survey has been submitted to the concerned authorities for administrative sanction. 
 
 The 100-km road was expanded into a four-lane highway 16 years ago. The proposal to expand it to six lanes was raised five years ago, when necessary land for the expansion was reportedly acquired in Srikakulam district. 
 
 According to sources in the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), a private organisation from Bangalore had conducted the survey on parameters such as number of vehicles plying on the route daily and peak timings of traffic rush. More than 10,000 major vehicles ply along the 100-km stretch everyday.
 
 Of the 100 km stretch, around 64 km stretch would come under Srikakulam district and the remaining under Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram districts. Around Rs 1,200 crore would be needed for the expansion in Srikakulam, while the remaining money would be spent on expansion from Anandapuram to Srikakulam district border, sources said. 
 
 Srikakulam district collector P Lakshmi Narsimham had announced the expansion of NH-16 at the Janmabhoomi meeting recently. As part of the expansion works, flyovers would also be constructed at busy junctions, a district higher official said. 
 
 “Traffic on the highway has increased due to development of businesses and educational institutions in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam,” an NHAI official said on condition of anonymity.
