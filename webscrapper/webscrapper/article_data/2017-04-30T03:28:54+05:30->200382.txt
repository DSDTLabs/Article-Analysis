NOIDA:   will now get their registration certificate (RC) by post from May 1 and not in hand, as the transport department has decided to stop the arrangement from next month.

 According to instructions issued by transport commissioner K Ravindra Naik to RTOs and assistant regional transport officers (ARTOs) of all districts last week, applicants who want to get an RC made will have to submit a stamped envelope to the department along with other documents required.
 
 While an applicant usually gets an RC within three-four days of applying, it might now take almost a week to get it by post.
 
 “The department has already issued notices to car/bike agencies in the district, instructing them to submit a stamped envelope for the applicant concerned. Most applicants seeking an RC come through an agency,” ARTO   told TOI.
