MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Wednesday ordered status quo on its single judge order quashing the appointment of   Joe as director of medical education (DME) of   and also directing the government to appoint dean of Karur Government Medical College,   as new DME. 

 The division bench of justices K Kalyanasundaram and S S Sundar passed this interim order on appeals filed by the government and the present director of medical education, Edwin Joe. The bench also directed Revwathy to file a counter to the case and adjourned the hearing to October 6. 
 
 Revwathy had filed a case claiming the post of DME. After hearing concerned sides, single judge R Mahadevan passed an order on September 20. Against it, the government and the present dean preferred appeals. 
 
 During arguments, the appellants told the court that civil medical seniority would be taken into consideration to give promotion up to the level of senior civil surgeon. Panel seniority and the date of appointment will be taken into consideration for the above senior civil surgeon level post. 
 
 Edwin Joe was the first to complete more than 10 years of teaching experience. Revwathy’s statement that she is senior-most to Edwin is not acceptable in the eye of law. Accordingly, the government took a decision to promote and appoint him as DME. Besides, the government has powers to appoint medical officer based on merits and ability to a certain post. But, the singe judge did not consider those submissions, the appellants said. 
 
 Hence, the appellants prayed to set aside the single judge order. The government also said that the post of DME is an important post, which could not be allowed to remain vacant. Following it, the bench ordered status quo on the single judge’s order.
