NEW DELHI. After being slammed on social media for installing iron spikes on the pavement outside their Fort branch in Mumbai – apparently to drive away beggars and the homeless -   today apologized and ordered their removal.

 "We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused to the public by the installation of the spikes at our Fort Branch, as part of the recent renovation. We're having the spikes removed on priority," the bank tweeted.
 
 
  
 ANI today shared visuals of bank workers removing the 4-inch long nails that were installed on the pavement.
 
 
  
 Photos of the deadly metal spikes were shared on social media yesterday, with people expressing concerns that these could be dangerous to pedestrians who suddenly lose their balance while walking and even to children and old people.
 
 
  
 Some Twitter users also pointed that these spikes are the infamous anti-homeless spikes that are put up to discourage homeless people from sleeping on the pavement.
 
 
  
 The private bank was condemned for its “lack of empathy”.
 
 
  
 The bank was labelled “cruel”.
 
 
  
 People began seeking punishment for those behind the installation.
 
 
  
 Many threatened to boycott the bank if it did not act immediately to remove the spikes.
 
 
  
 
  
 JNU veteran student   too joined the clamour in lambasting the bank.
 
 
  
 The outrage led to an apology from HDFC's corporate communications head, Neeraj Jha, who regretted the inconvenience and said that the spikes will be removed.
