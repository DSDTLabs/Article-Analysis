Ludhiana: On one hand the government is running several ‘go green’ initiatives to make the city people aware about the importance of greenery, on the other hand the government officials are turning a blind eye to the National Green Tribunal’s (NGT) ban on axing of trees. On Monday, officials of the circuit house were seen cutting down the trees without taking any authorised permission from the forest department.

 Within a few minutes, the officials had cut off the branches of over 100 trees, which were planted on the circuit house premises. Sushil Kumar, supervisor of the circuit house, said, “We have raised the issue before the Municipal Corporation to chop off some of unwanted branches of the trees planted on the premises of the circuit house but they did not give us any response, following which we decided to chop off branches of some of the tress. These trees were creating problem in maintaining cleanliness of the premises.”
 
 Charanjit Singh, divisional forest officer, said, “National Green Tribunal has completely banned tree felling. If something has happened against the orders then it is an issue of concern and forest department will raise the issue with the higher authorities.”
 
 Singh added that if anyone wants to cut off branches of trees, one has to first seek permission from the administration and forest department. “If the work has been done without taking permission, it is against the norms.”
 
 Amandeep Singh, a member of an NGO, said, “Ludhiana is one of the most polluted cities. Even after this, the government officials are doing this kind of work. This is shocking. Government should ensure protection of trees particularly in the city area where high level of pollution has been reported.”
