GHAZIABAD: A day after a spurned lover allegedly slashed the throat of her newly married neighbour in  's   on Saturday morning, the accused is still at large, said police. 

 “We have kept the accused’s phone on surveillance since the incident yesterday and we are trying to trace his location but his phone is apparently on the switch-off mode since 8:30pm on Saturday. We have also tried to speak to his friends but no significant progress has been made so far,” Kavish Malik, the investigation officer, told TOI.
 
 The accused, Kashyap, allegedly attacked 26-year-old woman, Ritu Chauhan, with a shaving blade when she was alone at her home. 
 
 Police said Kashyap wanted to marry Ritu but she got married to one Pradeep Chauhan from Sonepat on March 4. She had come to celebrate Holi with her widowed mother and brother. An FIR has been filed under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC at the Sahibabad police station. 
 
 Ritu underwent tracheostomy, an operative procedure, and is now out of danger. She is still in the ICU. “Her entire wind pipe (Larynx) and voice box were damaged. It was a complicated surgery. Her vitals are stable but she is still on oxygen support,” said Dr Jaiprakash Kumar, surgeon, Narender Mohan hospital in Mohan Nagar. 
 
 The family members are hoping Ritu would be able to speak again. “There is a 50% chance. In many cases, the victim is able to talk after such surgeries,” Dr Kumar said.
