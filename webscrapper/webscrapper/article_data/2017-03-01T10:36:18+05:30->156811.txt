HYDERABAD: Worried over   for construction of two-bedroom houses, the state government is now eyeing vacant and unused land that belongs to various   and institutions.

 The   (GHMC) requires about 400 acres for construction of one lakh two-bedroom houses (2BHKs) in Greater Hyderabad limits. As of now, GHMC took up work on about 10,000 houses, mainly due to non-availability of land. The tendering process for another 10,000 houses is expected to be completed soon.
 
 Official sources said that for instance, the government wants the 800 acres of vacant that belongs to   (IDPL) at Balangar. The Centre had proposed to sell part of IDPL land and use the funds for the units revival. Similarly, some institutions such as Survey of India and HCL have vast tracts of land which the government wants to use for the 2 BHK project. The government already informed the railways that it wants to take over railway quarters' land near Secunderabad railway station for the housing scheme in return for alternate land elsewhere. Minister T Padma Rao even visited the railway quarters at Chilkalguda a few months ago.
 
 “Municipal administration minister K T Rama Rao has directed the Hyderabad and Ranga Reddy district collectors to identify land and submit a report,“ GHMC chief engineer   told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, Rama Rao reviewed the housing programme on Tuesday with chief secretary SP Singh and decided that a land bank was required for the government's flagship programme . He directed the GHMC officials to begin construction of 2 BHK houses before March this year.
 
 Rama Rao also said once land is identified, he will meet Union ministers of concerned departments and request them to hand over the land for the housing scheme.
