JAIPUR: Despite Supreme Court’s order, people still hesitant to take accident victims to hospital due to fear of police.

 Dr DS  , medical superintendent,  , was on his way to a temple on Saturday morning. While passing through elevated road near  , he noticed crowd surrounding a person lying on the road with severe injuries. But, no one was helping the victim in rushing him to the hospital.
 
 Dr Meena checked the pulse of the victim and he asked two persons to help the victim to get into his car. He rushed the patient to SMS Hospital and directed the doctors to provide him treatment. 
 
 “I noticed that people were not helping the victim but they were looking at him. The victim was riding a bike when he met with an accident. There is a golden hour in which a patient gets medical treatment. The chances of saving his life is always higher. There is Supreme Court’s guideline which ensures that those who bring road accident victims to hospitals for treatment will not face any legal formality. Also, police will not question him. People should always help road accident victims,” Dr Meena said.
