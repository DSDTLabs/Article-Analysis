RANCHI: The state government's efforts to   from one lakh farmers this year has received   till now. Data collected by the  ,   state that although text messages and phone calls were made to roughly 10,000 farmers, only 1,000 have visited the collection centres to sell their harvest. 

 In an effort to reach out to farmers, the department recently called and sent text messages to the those registered in its database. The intention of the service is to remind them of the date for visiting the paddy procurement centres and sell their harvest. 
 
 However, though 9,300 farmers were expected to visit the procurement centres, only 1,000 have turned out so far.
 
 "The response rate is low and it is a matter of concern," state food, civil supplies and public distribution secretary   said on Tuesday. "We have asked the agencies concerned to speed up the communication process and get in touch with 10,000 more farmers in the next four days," Choubey added.
 
 Notably, the department has decided to procure paddy from one lakh farmers, nearly 2.5 times the number in 2016. The department on Tuesday claimed that it has completed the verification of 30,000 new farmers till the first week of January and an equivalent number will be registered in a week. 
 
 Notably, the state cabinet in December had agreed to purchase paddy at higher prices (Rs 1,600 per quintal) than that sanctioned by the Centre (Rs 1,470). 
 
 Speaking to TOI, Choubey claimed that the low response was due to fact that the harvest was not yet complete. "Unlike other states, paddy is harvested in   up to the end of December. We are getting in touch with the farmers but they are not being able to come because the harvest is still not complete," Choubey said.
