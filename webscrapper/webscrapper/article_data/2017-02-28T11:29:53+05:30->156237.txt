MAPUSA:   wore a deserted look during the first half of Monday as traders, shopkeepers and most vendors observed a bandh protesting various  .

 While the   had previously announced a half-day strike, many shoppers were taken unawares when they found shops shut as well as the fish and vegetable markets closed for business.
 
 A large number of shopkeepers and vendors, led by association president   took out a morcha to the municipality after winding its way through the market area. Holding placards, they shouted slogans against the municipality’s functioning which they alleged was not protecting local interests.
 
 They alleged a scam in the sopo tender and also highlighted inaction by the MMC against encroachments in the market and that there is no space for shoppers. They also charged authorities for ignoring traffic congestion.
 
 After the morcha was stopped by the police, a delegation led by Shirodkar called on Mapusa Municipal Council chairperson Sandeep Falari and submitted a memorandum highlighting their grievances.
 
 Falari rejected the charge of irregularity in the sopo tender. He promised to look into the other concerns within a week.
 
 Shirodkar said that shopkeepers are agitated as this is not the first time they are raising the same issues with the MMC. “There has been no proactive response from the MMC, so merchants decided to hold a half-day bandh. In the future, if the MMC doesn’t take action, merchants will be forced to be more aggressive and authorities will be accountable,” he said.
