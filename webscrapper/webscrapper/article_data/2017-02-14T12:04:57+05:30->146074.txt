INDORE: Examinations time is around the corner and the CBSE   in the city are gearing up for the free and fair conduction of the exams. The   exams are scheduled to start on March 9. 

 This year with the increase in the number of students appearing for the board exams, the officials have requested to add more exam centres. Therefore, over four or five new examination centres may be set up in the city.
 
 "We have requested for more number of exam centres this year, the board will soon give its confirmation with regard to this. It will also check the location of the new proposed exam centres with the help of their GPS system and on the basis of it they will proceed further," said DC Sharma, city coordinator for CBSE board examination here. 
 
 The officials will look for storage facility focusing on the safety of the board question papers. The schools that have banks nearby will be preferred by the board so that the question papers can be stored at the banks. Transportation facility for students is another aspect that the board will consider before adding the new centres, he added. 
 
 Over 10,000 students from around 110 CBSE schools of the district will appear for class 10 and 12 board exams this year. The CBSE has already released the admit cards for the students appearing in the board exams this year and the examination centres have been allotted on the admit cards to the students. "If the board reshuffles the exam centres and adds any new ones then the board officials will have to inform respective schools about the change," said Sharma.
