KOLKATA: Every student in   schools will have to study   as a compulsory subject from Class I to Class X.

 State education minister   announced the plan to make Bengali compulsory, including in ICSE and CBSE-affiliated schools, at a press conference on Monday.
 
 The move by the Mamata Banerjee-led government follows the Centre's move to make Hindi compulsory for all   and ICSE students from Class I to X. "India is a large nation and our strength is unity in diversity," Partha said. "We have received complaints that Bengali is not provided as an option in several schools," he added.
 
 Schools affiliated to the Bengal board give students the option of picking two languages out of seven. "We will consult our legal team on whether we need a separate law, or just a special approval from the state cabinet will suffice in effecting this change," Partha said.
