Despite the reckless and rash driving by the private buses, most of the passengers prefer using it for the daily commuting. It is evident from the fact that most of the private route buses are packed, while the government buses in the same routes carry less number of passengers. School and college goers, who form the major chunk of the travellers during morning and evening hours, too prefer to travel in private buses.

 Passengers say that private buses are faster thus enabling them to reach the destination on time. Many say that the private buses are better maintained and clean, where the government buses fail on both fronts.
 
 L Muthupandi a passenger from Natham said that private buses reach the destination faster even though it starts a bit late than the government buses. The quality of service in the private buses cannot be compared to the government buses, which are not cleaned regularly. "Moreover, after the recent bus fare hike, the cost of ticket is less in private buses. Why should I shell out more in government buses," he asked.
 
 J Sivakumar from T Kallupatti says that it feels good to travel in private buses as it overtakes government buses along the way. Moreover, the sound system in the buses is quite good. "They have a very good collection of songs and we enjoy the ride along with friends," he said.
 
 Vanaja Rajendran, a city resident, said she used to prefer government buses for long travel during day time, but ever since the recent bus fare hike, she shifted using private buses. "There is not much difference in fare, but there is big difference in the service between the two," she said.
