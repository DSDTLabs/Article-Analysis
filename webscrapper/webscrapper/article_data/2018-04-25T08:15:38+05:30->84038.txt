CHANDIGARH: A   court on Tuesday directed the   jail authorities to get an undertrial in the cash-for-jobs scam of the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) diagnosed and treated for   from the Post Graduate Institute for Medical Education and Research ( ), Chandigarh.

 Additional sessions judge (ADJ) Narender Sura issued the order while acting on the plea of Surender Singh, a resident of Sector 15, Panchkula, and prime accused in the cash-for-jobs scam. In his petition, Surender had said he was suffering from cancer and had informed the Ambala jail authorities requesting them for diagnosis and treatment. According to information, Surender is at the third stage of cancer.
 
 He alleged the Ambala jail authorities had denied his request saying that there was no such treatment or diagnostic centre for performing the PET test. The test was either available at PGIMER Chandigarh or the tertiary care hospitals of the private sector.
 
 “Treatment is absolute and paramount obligation and the jail authorities cannot deviate from their duties only on the ground that requisite facility is not available in the jail or in the civil hospital, Ambala City, or on the ground of non-availability of the police escort guard. While in judicial custody, it is the duty and obligation of the state government to take care of undertrial prisoners and this duty includes giving proper medical treatment if a prisoner is suffering from any ailment,” the judge said in his order.
 
 The judge also directed the Panchkula deputy commissioner of police (DCP) to ensure travel arrangements of the accused.
