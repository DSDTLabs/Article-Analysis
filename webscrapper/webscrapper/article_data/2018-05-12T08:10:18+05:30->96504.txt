CHANDIGARH: Two youths have been booked for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl of their village in   district.

 Though the alleged incident happened in February, the girl and her family approached the police on Friday.
 
 Uklana SHO Sandeep Kumar said the girl was legally counselled after which a case under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC and Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered against the accused based on her statement before the child welfare council.
 
 “Since the accused are on the run, we are not sure whether they are adults or minors,” said SHO Kumar. He said the girl had been sent for the medical examination.
 
 Sources said the survivor is a student of Class X and hails from a Dalit family. Her parents are daily wagers.
 
 The girl told the police that the accused kidnapped her when she was alone in her house in the last week of February, took her to a secluded place and raped her. Threatened of dire consequences, the girl did not inform anyone about the incident out of fear, said sources.
 
 SHO Kumar said the case was registered after verification of facts. “Police parties are conducting raids to arrest the accused. Since the accused too hail from Dalit families, we have not added the SC/ST Act in the case,” he said.
