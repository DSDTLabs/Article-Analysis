GURGAON: DHBVN had to eat a humble pie on Tuesday after it failed to produce evidence against a resident of Civil Lines who dragged the   to the Permanent   in Gurgaon in March 2015 after it imposed a bill of nearly Rs 2.5 lakh on him.

 The discom, in its defence, had maintained 63-year-old Jagdish was the guarantor of another consumer who had defaulted in the wake of which his penalty amount was added to Jagdish’s bill. But the discom had not produced any evidence to corroborate its claim. Jagdish, on his part, had furnished all the relevant documents that strengthened the case in his favour.
 
 Sources said the court of Justice Gagandeep Mittal had last month ruled in favour of Jagdish, while pulling up the discom for arbitrariness. It also barred the discom from recovering the amount (Rs 2,44,437) from Jagdish or withdrawing his power connection, and asked it to compensate the consumer the litigation cost of Rs 10,000.
 
 On Tuesday though, DHBVN’s superintending engineer (Gurgaon circle) shot a letter to officials concerned, asking them to comply with the court’s directions, while recovering the litigation cost of Rs 10,000 from the erring official.
 
 “As the nigam has failed to prove its position to prove the imposition of Rs 2,44,437 on the consumer, it is therefore desired that bill of the consumer may be corrected and penalty may be recovered from the erring official for fixing the (wrong) liability,” the letter read.
