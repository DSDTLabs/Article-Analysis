DEHRADUN: The scare of the deadly Nipah virus that has claimed 10 lives in Kerala was felt in   as well on Wednesday when 18 dead bats were discovered in the premises of the Government Senior Secondary School at Barma Papdi in Nahan sub-division of Sirmaur district in  , less than 100 km from state capital Dehradun. The natural host of the virus — which was first identified during an outbreak that place in Kampung Sungai Nipah in Malaysia in 1998 — are fruit bats which is why the discovery assumed significance.
 
  Following the discovery, Uttarakhand health officials issued an alert asking personnel in medical centres in the area to be on the lookout for suspicious cases of fever. Dr Archana Shrivastava, the state director general of health, told TOI, “As a precautionary move, all our medical officers have been asked to be on alert to check if there is a possible threat from the dead bats found in Himachal Pradesh. Each case of fever will be looked at promptly and anyone having Nipah-like symptoms will have their blood samples taken on priority.”
  
  The chief medical officer of Dehradun, Dr SK Gupta, added that “personnel manning medical facilities near the Uttarakhand-Himachal border have been adequately briefed about symptoms and other details regarding the virus.” Sources in the health department said that a move to screen visitors especially those coming from Kerala was being mulled over although no decision has been taken on it yet.
  
  Meanwhile, Shrivastava said that there was no need for people in the state to panic. “The blood samples of the dead bats have been sent to the National Institute of Virology, Pune. There is no need for people to worry. The alert issued by us is just a precautionary move to ensure everyone in our state is safe.”
