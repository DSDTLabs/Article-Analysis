KOCHI: A team of doctors at   successfully removed the brain tumour of a patient who remained awake and communicated with doctors while the surgery was being performed. 

 
 The team led by Dr Dalwin  , consultant, department of neurosurgery, performed the three-hour-long awake   surgery on a 45-year-old man named Jamher A in the hospital.
 
 At present, the   native is receiving post - operative care and being monitored in the hospital.
 
 "The patient is awake but is given controlled sedation. In this surgical procedure, the patient's scalp was numbed. He was administered a nerve or scalp block - an injection of medication to block pain (controlled sedation) and local anaesthesia to numb the scalp. The anaesthesia is administered to prevent pain and not to remove consciousness," said Dr Thomas.
 
 "Awake brain surgeries are used by neurosurgeons to remove tumours that are located close to areas that control vision, language and body movements. In Jamher's case, the tumour was in the motor area of the brain, which controls the movement of hands and legs. While these surgeries are being performed, there is a risk of patient losing their significant functions or movements. We ask the patient to talk as well as to move hands and legs during the surgery," said Dr Thomas.
 
 As awake brain surgeries are expensive, the amount required to perform Jamher's surgery was met through the   scheme of state government.
