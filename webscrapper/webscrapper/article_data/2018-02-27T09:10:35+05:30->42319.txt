GUWAHATI: A day before Nagaland goes to the polls, ruling   ( ) lodged a complaint with the   about an advertisement by the rival   which promises financial grants and infrastructure expansion if it comes to power in the state. 

 "The NDPP-BJP alliance has, through a full front-page advertisement in local daily newspapers today (February 26, 2018), blatantly violated the model code of conduct by making a slew of promises," NPF associate press secretary   stated in the letter to the EC, a copy of which is with TOI.
 
 According to NPF, the advertisement promises "100% funding of centrally-sponsored schemes for the northeast and Rs 5,300 crore for infrastructure development in the next three years." The Centre-to-state share of funding for centrally-sponsored schemes is 90:10 at present. In addition, the advertisement promises Rs 10,000 crore for roads, Rs 3,000 crore for the   railway line, Rs 1,800 crore for Kohima Smart City project and Rs 800 crore for power connectivity, NPF added.
 
 EC guidelines clearly state that after elections are announced, "ministers and other authorities shall not ... announce any financial grants is any form or promises thereof; or ... make any promise of construction of roads."
