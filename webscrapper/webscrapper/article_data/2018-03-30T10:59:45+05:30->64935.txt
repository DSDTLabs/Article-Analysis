CHANDIGARH: UT home department has rejected   department’s   of promoting constables, head constables, assistant sub-inspectors (ASI) and sub-inspectors (SI) on the pattern of   police service rules. Home department has cited the proposal as contrary to Punjab service pattern. 

 UT police department had sent two letters in this regard to home department in September 2017 and in January this year. Home department has also demanded clarification from the police department on the number of vacant posts, eligible candidates who have passed B1 test and why relaxation is required to fill vacant posts of head constables in department. In one letter, department had requested administration to allow one time relaxation in the criteria required to fill up vacant posts of head constables on seniority-cum-merit basis. Home department said that the condition and scales of pay of UT police are on Punjab pattern. The department has already re-designated the constables as senior constables on Punjab pattern during the years 2015 and 2016. Therefore, there was a need to follow the Punjab police order for re-designation of constables as head constables on completion of 16 years of their service.
 
 In the other letter, police department asked for adoption of Haryana’s policy regarding grant of personal rank of ASI on completion of 22 years of regular service as constable/head constables and personnel rank of SI on completion of 30 years of service to the police personnel. Rejecting the proposal, administration said the Assured Career   (ACP) Scheme is already granted to the employees including police personnel keeping in view the lack of promotional avenues.
