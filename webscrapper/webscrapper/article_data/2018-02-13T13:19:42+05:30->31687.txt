Madurai: A Swachh Survekshan team arrived here on Monday to take stock of the city’s cleanliness, whose outcome would reflect in the Swachh Bharat rankings to be release later this year. As part of the exercise, the team would inspect various places and interact with the residents on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 On the first day, the team restricted itself to the civic   office, functioning in   in  , and met with various officials and interacted with them. A range of documentation done in the last few months were submitted for the team’s perusal. 
 
 The all-India exercise is being carried out to rank the cities based on the cleanliness standards for 2018. Madurai city, which was ranked 26 in 2016, slipped to 57 in 2017 among the total number of 434 towns and cities assessed last year. This year, as many as 4,041 towns and cities will be assessed for the sanitation conditions. 
 
 The civic body has been taking various steps towards the cleanliness drive and aim to secure one of the top rankings. While the solid waste management rules are strictly enforced, it is also encouraging residents to effectively segregate the waste at the source level and convert them into compost. 
 
 At present, 600 tonnes of solid waste is generated in a day of which around 500 tonnes are processed by the civic body. It encourages the commercial establishments to process the remaining waste. 
 
 Corporation commissioner   said the team will be interacting directly with the public and they have a role to play. 
 
 Meanwhile, a video released by the corporation recently to create sensitisation on the solid waste management has started going viral on social media, reaching the masses.
