HYDERABAD: The Miyapur depot of Hyderabad Metro Rail is standing on shaky ground, just two months after it was inaugurated with fanfare. Now, it turns out that the depot has come up on Enemy Property â€” land left behind by people who migrated to Pakistan during Partition and was taken over by the Centre.

 What added to the confusion is involvement of multiple agencies in the handling of this land. While the Union home ministry is custodian of Enemy Properties, the state governments are its managers. According to sources in revenue department, there are about 3,000 acres of   in Ranga Reddy, Mahbubnagar and   districts, but authorities are unsure about the exact extent of land in each district. Earlier, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had directed the revenue department to survey Enemy Property under the ongoing   (LRUP).
 
 In Miyapur, Enemy Properties are spread over 251 acre. And even as this land is under litigation after individuals claimed ownership, the Centre allotted all 251acres to Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) even as the state government allocated 104 acres from it for Miyapur Metro depot. The Hyderabad Metro Rail Limited (HMRL) took possession of 104 acres from the government after depositing Rs 100 crore with Ranga Reddy court as it was under litigation.
 
 
  
  
 
 Now, matters have come to a head with Union home minister   stating a couple of days ago that Union government wants to raise nearly Rs 1lakh crore by auctioning Enemy Properties across the country. Apparently, the Centre has identified 9,400 properties for conducting auction and already initiated a physical survey of land. Last year, the NDA government amended the Enemy Property Act which empowers the custodian (the Centre) to sell land and deny private ownership.
