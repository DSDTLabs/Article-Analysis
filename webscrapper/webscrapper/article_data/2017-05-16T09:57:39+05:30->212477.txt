 On whether there was increasing sexism in American politics, the two senators said, "Even now, the percentage of women in politics is low in America. That a woman candidate has to struggle is a reality across the world.'' 
 
 A question on whether media was responsible for the increasing loss of civility in politics, Deb said, "Media should report and not give opinions. Social media, like Twitter, by people who don't know how to use it or understand its impact and hide behind it to spew abuses and hate does reduce the possibility of a civil discourse between two people with opposing ideologies.''
