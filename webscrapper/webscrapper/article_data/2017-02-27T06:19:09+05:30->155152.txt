 As per the MCI guidelines for recognition of 150 MBBS seats and 111 PG seats, this institution requires additional posts of 18 associate professors, 11 assistant professors and two senior residents.
 
 Already one post of professor three posts of associate professor and 75 posts of assistant professor are lying vacant.
 
 This entire faculty is from clinical specialties.The faculty who have been now transferred has been included in the faculty table submitted during MCI inspection or in the compliance report submitted to MCI for Thrissur MCH.They have also appeared for the last MCI inspection at Thrissur, said Dr  , state president of   (KGMCTA).
