LUDHIANA: Amid noises of discontent in other parties over allocation of tickets to women candidates, several of whom were related to local political leaders for various wards, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders claimed the party had chosen candidates strictly on the basis of merit, and most of them had no relations with local politicians. The party — which is in alliance with the   (LIP) — released the first list of its candidates for MC elections on Wednesday.

 A member of the candidates’ selection committee,   ( ) said except for his wife,  , who is contesting as AAP candidate from Ward No.11, no other candidate had any affiliantion with politics in the past. He added that a majority of tickets were given to social workers, party leaders, and volunteers. “Since our party is just four years old, most of the candidates are newcomers in politics, and don’t have political connections,” said the AAP leader.
 
 The state spokesperson for AAP,   — who is a member of the committee — said that as the ruling   had reserved many seats for women where they had strong male candidates, the choice of their family members was but obvious. He added that they also gave tickets to AAP office-bearers, including Navneet from Ward No.91, Neeru Chandilya from Ward No.68, and   from Ward No.21.
