CHENNAI: There were a few raised eyebrows when the national selection committee included veteran   for the ongoing ODI series against England. Chairman of selectors   is a relieved man now that the southpaw responded with a match-winning 150 in the second ODI and helped the team bag the series 2-0 in Cuttack on Thursday.

 “Yuvraj's inclusion was a collective decision by the selection committee and he had no backing from a particular person of the team management. Yuvraj had a good run in the Ranji Trophy and cracked hundreds and double hundreds. He looked hungrier for runs and we wanted to give him a chance against England so that he can continue his good form with the bat on the international stage too. We all are happy that he came up with such a brilliant knock yesterday and helped the team win the match. We hope he will maintain his form in the last ODI as well as in the T20s,” Prasad told TOI on Friday.
 
 Skipper   had earlier said Yuvraj was picked to strengthen an inexperienced middle-order and ease the burden on MS Dhoni. Prasad, too, echoed similar sentiment. “Yes, that's a huge plus to have a batsman like Yuvraj in the middle-order. The way he batted it proved once again that experience matters at this level. Yuvraj's inclusion in the side has strengthened our belief and confidence,” Prasad explained.
 
 He, however, chose to be non-committal when asked whether Yuvraj has already sealed a spot for the Champions Trophy in June. “It's too early to talk about that as there are still five months left for it. Moreover, fitness plays a big role when it comes to selection. We want to be fair to every single player and performance will be counted. Our decision may backfire sometimes but our intention will never go wrong.”
