For the first time ever, South Indian film star   gave a clear indication on the 
  saying on Thursday that if elections are held in the next 100 days, “I will be there“.

 Speaking to Times Now editor-in-chief Rahul Shivshankar, Kamal also indicated that he is unlikely to have “any business with any of the existing political parties“.
 
 Kamal said while he will cooperate with all parties, he won't align with any of them. “I am not going to do business with any of them. I will go alone,“ he announced. Replying to a question on the internal squabbles within   and the possibility of assembly polls in three months (or 100 days), Kamal said, “This is a forced marriage... The bride, that's the people of  , wants to be out of the marriage. If there is election in 100 days, I will be there.“
  
 In another big revelation, 
  to enter the political arena. “I had met   4-5 weeks back... Both of us were working... [I] had a conversation... Both of us have a common target, first fight corruption... But I will take a different route, he takes another. We didn't discuss the details, so there was no disagreement there. I hugged him and told him that I am going in.“
 
 When Rajini too enters the ring, it would be interesting to see how the battle of the two Tamil superstars shapes up. Kamal, however, says they have agreed to “set an example“ as political rivals. “We have been in the cinema field as competitors, but in politics we want to set an example. I will not take pot shots at him, he will also do the same,“ Kamal said.
 
 Showing no intention of holding back his punches, Kamal delivered a direct snub to Congress vice-president   on his allegation of the government muzzling people's freedom of expression. When asked of his point of view on Rahul's statement that the   government is the most oppressive government, Kamal said, “I don't know when he was born, but I was born much earlier. I have seen emergency. There was no greater oppression than emergency.“
