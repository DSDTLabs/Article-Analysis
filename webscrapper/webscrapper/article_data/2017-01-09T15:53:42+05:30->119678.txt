No pomp, no frills, no bling. This is the only way one can describe   medal winning wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt’s wedding card. The athlete, who is getting married to   girl  , explains why he has opted for this particular invite. In a telechat, the wrestler shares: “The card made of handmade paper is simple and earthy just like me. I don’t like ostentatious things or behaviour. Also, my family hasn’t changed over the years, so we decided to keep things simple.”
The wedding will be celebrated in traditional Haryanavi manner; main ceremonies will begin with manda pujan on January 14. “The formal engagement will be organised the same evening at a wedding venue at Murthal Road in Sonepat. This function organised by our family will be attended by almost 5000 guests. The wedding function will be organised by Sheetal’s family on January 16 at a resort on Karnal- Delhi Road. There will be around 4000 guests at the wedding. I have invited my friends from wrestling fraternity for the wedding functions,” says Yogeshwar. 
 Ask the groom about his wedding attire and Yogeshwar says: “For the wedding, I will wear tan coloured blazer and trousers, teamed with a modi (turban) which is mandatory for a groom to wear in our family. I will not wear a sehra.”
