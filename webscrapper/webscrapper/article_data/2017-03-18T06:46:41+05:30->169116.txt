BENGALURU: The state cabinet on Friday cleared   projects, including an elevated corridor to connect Koramangala with  . 

 The proposal to charge toll at 19 state highways which were widened and built under the Karnataka State Highways Improvement Project (KSHIP), also got approval from the cabinet. 
 
 The 2.4km elevated corridor was initially proposed under the now-defunct   (JnNURM). However, with the NDA government scrapping the scheme, the corridor was to be constructed under the Nagarothana scheme of the state government. But due to alleged red-tape, the Rs 204-crore project was awaiting clearance. 
 
  Promotion quota to be challenged 
 
  The cabinet decided to challenge the   ruling on scrapping reservation in promotions. 
 
 On February 9, the Supreme Court had struck down consequential seniority in promotions awarded by the Karnataka government for SC/ST employees since 1978. 
 
 The apex court fixed a three-month period for demoting those promoted under the reserved category. 
 
 With the fate of nearly 10,000 dalit government employees hanging in balance after the SC ruling, the government decided to file a review petition. 
 
 The proposal to increase the number of seats in six government medical colleges - Mandya, Hassan, Shivamogga, Raichur, Bidar and Belagavi - was also cleared.
