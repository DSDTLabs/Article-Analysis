Marking the 127th birth anniversary of the ‘Architect of Modern India’, Babasaheb  , the seventh edition of ‘Run for Caste Free India’ was organised on Saturday morning at Necklace Road. Hundreds of men, women and children wearing green T-shirts took part in the run to build a caste-free India. Jointly organised by   (PBI) and   (DICCI), the run which began at People’s Plaza concluded at Ambedkar Statue on the Tank Bund.
Dr Om Prakash Sama, one of the founder members of   that was launched on this day, said that inter-caste marriages are not only good for the society, but also for the diversity. Sharing details of the survey of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, he said that the research shows that people marrying with the same ethnicity, community and caste are prone to genetic diseases.
 “The study analysed samples from more than 2800 individuals from 275 distinct South Asian groups. It states that the population of 1.5 billion in South Asia were more vulnerable to rare genetic population-specific diseases than elsewhere in the world because of the endogamous marriages or marrying with the same ethnicity, community, and caste, etc,” he said.
