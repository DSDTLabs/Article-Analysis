PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation’s plan — to connect the Pashan-Panchavati area with Kothrud with a tunnel through a hill — is likely to move forward with the civic body’s standing committee receiving a proposal from the administration. The proposal seeks to appoint a consultant for the project and conduct a geological survey at the site.

 The proposal is expected to come up for discussion in the meeting scheduled next week. However local residents and environmentalist have opposed the plan.
 
 In recent times, this is the second road project the civic administration has pushed that is aligned along the hills in the city. Earlier in the month, the administration had initiated steps to appoint consultants for the   road link, which is proposed along the   road hills. There is also a third plan — to connect Sinhagad road to Pune Satara road — by blasting a tunnel through the   hill complex. Sahakarnagar residents have opposed the plan.
 
 The Pashan-Panchvati tunnel project was proposed in the civic budget (2017-18) by the then standing committee chairman Muralidhar Mohol with an initial allotment of Rs 1 crore. The proposed tunnel is expected to provide an additional road connection between Kothrud and Pashan and provide relief to those having to take a detour via Chandni chowk etc.
 
 The administration started the preliminary work on the project a few months ago. Initially, it invited proposals from empanelled consultants. Only one consultant approached PMC.
 
 The Pashan-Panchvati and Paud road-Balbharati tunnel projects have been opposed by the local residents and activists claiming an adverse impact on the environment. Residents want PMC to reroute the tunnel.
 
 J D Patil, a resident of Pashan-Panchavati, said, “The road will lead to more pollution. This area is a protected region. It will be good if the biodiversity is maintained. PMC can reroute the tunnel.”
