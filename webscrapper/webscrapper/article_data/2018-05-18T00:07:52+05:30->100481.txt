New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday issued non-bailable warrants (NBWs) against two DU students who were candidates in the last DUSU   and whose posters defaced public properties.

 A bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar noted that despite repeated orders, the candidates have failed to appear before it and issued NBWs against them.
 
  was hearing a PIL against   during   elections filed by advocate Prashant Manchanda.
 
 On its part, the Delhi Metro told the high court that the student leaders who defaced its properties during the varsity polls have identified sites for beautification as a pilot project and it will start from June 9-10 after the examinations. HC then sought a report on action taken in this regard before the next date of hearing on July 16.
 
 In his plea, Manchanda has sought a complete ban on defacement of public properties by DUSU poll candidates. During the hearing, the bench was also informed by authorities that the guidelines against defacement were yet to be finalised.
 
 It then asked Manchanda, DMRC, DU and the varsityâ€™s students union to coordinate with the joint registrar of the high court, Reetesh Singh, to finalise the guidelines. It indicated that the issue of guidelines would be taken up on May 29. The bench also directed the Centre, Delhi government and DU to take steps to publicise the penal consequences of defacement of public property, including in the campus area.
 
 Earlier the court had issued bailable warrants against several students, who had contested the 2017 DUSU polls, for failing to appear before it. HC has repeatedly warned DU student leaders that they might have to go to jail if found defacing public property ahead of the next DUSU elections .
