Keri: Almost 11 years after the sacred water tank of Kankumbi was damaged during excavation work on the Kalasa canal by the Karnataka Neeravari Nigam Limited (KNNL), repair works on it commenced in April. The village of Kankumbi in Karnataka is situated close to the Goa-Karnataka border and is famous for its Mauli temple, which is held in reverence by villagers on either sides of the border.  The sacred water tank lies in the vicinity of the temple at a spot called tirtha. A stream from the Malaprabha river, it is said, pours milky waters into the tank, bathing in which is considered most auspicious. A dip in its waters is believed to be all the more propitious once in 12 years, when Jupiter enters Capricorn. On the day, a zatra is held and devotees throng to the tank.  Since 2006, the tank has been lying in a dilapidated condition, despite the villagers’ repeated requests to KNNL to repair it. Nagesh Dalvi, who is part of the Mauli Temple Committee, told TOI, “Devotees come to this sacred tank in large numbers during the fair. After it was damaged, we were worried and wanted it repaired before the next zatra.” The last zatra was held in 2008. The next will be in 2019.
