PANAJI: Health minister Vishwajit Rane in a tweet on Tuesday said that he is working hard to meet the timeline to commission the   district hospital. 

 Rane who is currently in UK, tweeted saying, “working hard to turn the dream of the people of South Goa into reality. Had review meetings and will ensure that this project is commissioned as soon as possible. The new hospital will be a state-of-the-art hospital for the people of South Goa. It will have a cath lab, intensive care unit (ICU) and specialized facilities.”
 
 An official from the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) told TOI that they have written to the directorate of health services (DHS) stating they will complete the project by September. The project was slated to be completed in May.
 
 “New staff has to be recruited, equipment has to be brought and more importantly, the shift has to be undertaken smoothly,” said the officer.
 
 The completion of the South Goa district hospital has been extraordinarily delayed even as Margao MLA   as well as other South Goa elected representatives repeatedly bringing to the notice of the government the inconveniences caused to people of Goa South Goa.
 
 Hospicio hospital, which caters to South Goa, is in a dilapidated state. It also lacks many facilities as a result of which, often patients from South Goa who are in need of critical care are referred to   (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim.
