CHENNAI: Mylapore   and former director general of police R   has decided to vote against the Edappdi K Palaniswami government in   and to support the former chief minister O   group.

 Nataraj, who had been remaining neutral without joining the   and   general secretary V K   camps, said on Friday that he would vote against the government when the assembly takes up the trust vote on Saturday. 
 
 With this, the total number of AIADMK legislators who have decided to vote against the government has risen to 11.
 
 “I had to act according to the voices of my voters in the constituency. I have been receiving calls from every nook and corner of Tamil Nadu asking me to take a wise decision and this made me decide to vote against the government,” Natraj told TOI.
 
 Asked whether he was not afraid of the anti-defection law, Nataraj said for him respecting people’s sentiments was more important than the law. “I have always upheld ethics and have been honest. I need to answer my constituency people and therefore respect their sentiments. If I don’t, I will be failing in my duty,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, AIADMK whip S Rajendran has issued a whip asking all party MLAs to be present in the assembly on Saturday and participate in the assembly proceedings.
 
 The rebel camp, led by Panneerselvam, on Friday met assembly speaker P Dhanapal and presented a list of 10 MLAs (Nataraj’s name was not included) to him and said they would vote against the government.
 
 The Congress, which has eight MLAs, has also issued a whip asking all its MLAs to be present in the assembly on Saturday.
