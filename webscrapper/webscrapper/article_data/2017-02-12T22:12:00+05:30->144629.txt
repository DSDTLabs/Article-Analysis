GUNDLUET: A day after he accused   of paying Rs 1,000 crore to the  , former CM and state BJP chief   indicated that he could release some documents in support of his statement.

 He said he will make some disclosures which will rattle the ruling dispensation.
 
 Addressing party workers at Gundlupet, which is heading for a bypoll following the death of former minister  , the former CM said Siddaramaiah is talking lightly against him instead of explaining his position. “I’ll expose the deal on Sunday,” he said.
 
 According to him, a senior leader of the party, who is an elected representative, made the entries in his diary about payments to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore. This will also implicate the CM, he argued. Yeddyurappa said he will continue to target the CM ahead of the bypoll to Gundlupet and Nanjangud assembly segments. “I’ll expose the corruption prevalent in the state so that people can decide,” he stated. He attacked the Congress for luring JD(S) leader Kalale Keshavmurthy into the party fold to contest the bypoll to Nanjangud. “It’s a matter of shame that the national party, which is ruling the state for four years, doesn’t have a candidate to take on the BJP,” he stated.
 
 Meanwhile, Congress MP R Dhruvanarayana said in Mysuru that Keshavmurthy’s entry into the party will strengthen its base in the constituency. “We stand to benefit with the inclusion of Keshavmurthy into the party,” he told reporters. But he said the CM and KPCC will decide on the party’s candidate. He said the party is important and not the candidate.
