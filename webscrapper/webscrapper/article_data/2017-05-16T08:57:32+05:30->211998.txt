 recently visited YRF studio where she spotted Shah Rukh Khan’s vanity van. The actress took to Instagram to share a picture of SRK’s vanity mentioning a special message with the post. Anushka wrote:

 
 Soon after Anushka Sharma’s Instagram post,   reposted the actress’ post with a fair warning which sounds a bit hilarious! Shah Rukh said that he will report about Anushka as she is stalking him. Well, yeah! SRK addressed Anushka as a ‘stalker’ and we are sure, it was all said in a funny way. Take a look at Shah Rukh’s Instagram post with a warning message for Anushka.
 
 
 While both the actors are working together in Imtiaz Ali’s upcoming film, to see this conversation between the on-screen jodi was funny. We wonder how will Shah Rukh Khan stop Anushka Sharma stalking him since she will be following him religiously at promotional events of their film.
