THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Pointing at the repeated failure of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in handling the  , KPCC president M M Hassan, on Thursday, demanded handing over the home portfolio to someone else and called for the immediate suspension of a couple of police officers for the "cruelty" meted out to Mahija, the mother of Jishnu Pranoy. 

 "The chief minister has lost control over the police force and a strong dissent is brewing within the CPM. Party general secretary   should say whether he justifies Vijayan's actions or not," he told reporters. By reproaching the DGP for the police excess against Mahija, CPM leader   has given an indirect warning to Vijayan, he added.
 
 "Within no time of a police probe being ordered into the attack on Mahija, the chief minister justified the police action. This was, in a way, giving an indication to the investigating officer. This is most condemnable," Hassan said.
