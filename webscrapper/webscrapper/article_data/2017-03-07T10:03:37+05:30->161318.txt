VISAKHAPATNAM: The state government claims to have taken serious measures to   but a huge number of them still continue to flourish in the district and are offering liquor for just a little over the market price. 

 Sources in the excise department disclosed that there are over 1,200 belt shops in the district as against the licenced outlets which number 486. Of the 486, 123 are licensed bars while the rest are  
 
 The sources said one of the major reasons for the rise in belt shops was the demand created by NREGS workers in rural areas and rise in the customer base in the urban belt, especially youngsters. 
 
 The recent tragic incident, in which two youngsters died and two were seriously injured, after drinking liquor bought from the belt shops, also shows the   to stop outlets from   throughout the night.
 
 Sources said most of the belt shops enjoy protection from the political community as they contribute to the income of the panchayats by paying an annual revenue in the form of an indirect and undisclosed tax. A senior panchayat leader from Anakapalli said, “We tried culling the belt shops, but realised that it was not possible as their services extend to clients from within the vote bank. As a result, we decided to force them to pay a kind of penalty tax . However, this means that we have actually validated their existence.” 
 
 Apparently, these outlets cater to a large number of techies who work on late night shifts as well. 
 
 “These outlets get a lot of high-end as well as transit customers despite the presence of police. Booze is available even at 4 amin the morning,” said a regular customer of an outlet P Sri Ram.
 
 The recent tragic incident, in which two youngsters died and two were seriously injured, after drinking liquor bought from the belt shops, also shows the incapacity of the authorities to stop outlets from selling the intoxicant throughout the night
