PUDUCHERRY: Fares of buses operating in the interstate (Puducherry-Tamil Nadu) routes have been revised with effect from January 22 following hike of bus tickets by the Tamil Nadu government. Transport minister M O H F  , however, maintained that the Puducherry government did not hike the fare but indicated that revisions were inevitable when neighbouring states alter the prices. The Union territory and TN had earlier signed an agreement in this regard.

 Though the government persisted with the claim that no revisions were implemented, sources told TOI about the changes, which included the fare of Puducherry-Chennai (bypass)   (from Rs 200 to Rs 305) and the Puducherry-Tirupati Express (from Rs 170 to Rs 230). The Puducherry government had hiked the bus fare in October last year but was forced to roll back following widespread protests. 
 
 Puducherry Road Transport Corporation plies 84 buses including 54 buses operating in the   while private transport operators operate 220 buses including 100 buses in the interstate routes.
