MUMBAI: The   on Friday slammed the Pune police for failing to trace a minor who the parents allege has been kidnapped by Shwetang Nikalje, a history sheeter. “You have completely failed in your duty to protect members of the public,” said a vacation bench of Justice Shahrukh   and Ajay  .

 
 The HC heard a petition by the father of the girl who is 17 year and-10-months old.
 
 She had given her class XII exams recently. His petition alleged inaction by the   station to trace the girl on the mother’s April 6 complaint against Nikalje, who has serious offences registered against him in various police stations.
 
 On May 23, the court had summoned police commissioner Rashmi Shukla. However, deputy commissioner of police Pravin Munde, who filled in for her, assured that efforts will be made to find the girl. “Possible leads have been tried out. He is a hardened criminal,” added Munde. But Justice Kathawalla said, “It appears that nothing is being done by the police. That is why we called the police commissioner.” Munde also informed that IO is in hospital with a back ailment. The judges questioned why they were not told about it. “Why was investigation not transferred immediately?”, asked Justice Gadkari.
 
 The father’s advocate Ramakant Patil said police told the father that in a couple of months, the girl will turn a major, get married and return. “No wonder he is in hospital! He does not want to face us,” said Justice Kathawalla. Patil also said Nikalje’s relative are asking the girl’s parents to say she has eloped with him.
 
 When Munde informed that joint CP Ravindra Kadam is personally looking into the matter, the judges summoned him to the court on Saturday.
 
 “This is a very serious matter. Produce the girl tomorrow,” said Justice Kathawalla. The judges also want to know what action is taken against the IO.” The judges also indicated that they may direct a government hospital to examine the IO.
