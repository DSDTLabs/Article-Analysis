 shot for a scene in Zoya Akhtar’s ' ' at a near-empty Churchgate railway station recently.

 An old 12-coach railway rake was parked on platform No. 4 without an indicator. While the coaches closer to the engine driver’s cabin were relatively empty, the others were occupied. The train was heavily guarded by uniformed men from a private security agency. When BT inquired with the security staff, it was revealed that Ranveer was shooting a crucial scene for Gully Boy, where his character is seen boarding a Mumbai local. 
 
 The actor was in a coach towards the end of the train, which also had 50-60 junior artistes posing as his co-commuters. The shooting was planned for a Sunday so that it wouldn’t disturb regular commuters. The shoot went on for a couple of hours in the afternoon and wrapped up around 5.45 pm when the train, along with the technicians and the actors, left Churchgate station. The movie will feature   opposite Ranveer. Gully Boy is reportedly based on the life of rapper Naezy, who became popular after his collaboration with co-artiste Divine on the hit number Mere Gully Mein from 2015.
