 The road, once complete, will help streamline the cityâ€™s traffic as heavy vehicles will pass through Lucknow via ring road without entering the main city.
 
 The 105km road will pass through five national highways around Lucknow and will be constructed by   (NHAI).
 
 The eight-lane road will be a complete greenfield project, with no construction within existing infrastructure. The road will have a service lane on each side.
 
 The project will be built in five packages. Of these, four stretches will be funded by the Centre and the fifth by the state government.
 
 In the first phase, NHAI has chosen to construct the 15km patch from Kursi to Sitapur Road as acquisition of land has been finalised.
 
 NHAI expects to complete two stretches by December 2018.
 
 Meanwhile, NHAI is also expecting to get around Rs 2,000 crore for the long pending project of four-laning of   highway (NH-56).
 
 The project is expected to reduce travel time from Lucknow to Varanasi and promote tourism in both heritage cities.
