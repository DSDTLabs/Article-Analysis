The search for   Dutt’s reel daughter has ended, with   being signed on to play the titular role in 'Bhoomi'. Director   has chosen the actress as the leading lady for Dutt’s comeback vehicle that goes on floors in three weeks. 

 There were reports of several names doing the rounds, including Alia Bhatt, Shraddha Kapoor, Kriti Sanon and Sayyeshaa Sehgal, but Aditi has bagged the role. Omung, who is back from the second round of recce in Agra, says, “We shortlisted Aditi because she’s in a good space right now. I love the way she emotes. This, unlike her other projects, will be her film. She’s a relatively untapped actress. The father-daughter relationship is an important aspect of the narrative in this revenge drama. Aditi’s face perfectly blends softness with a lot of strength. Besides, I like to team up people, who seem unlikely to be cast together, in my movies.” 
 
 Aditi has already met her reel daddy Sanjay a few times, and has bonded well with him. According to a source close to the actor, the baap-beti jodi are comfortable with each other, almost as if they’ve known each other for a long time. 
 
 Bring this up, and Omung, who decided to direct the film on Sanjay’s demand, says, “Aditi’s role goes hand-in-hand with Dutt’s track in the film. His journey is physically demanding, while her role will display an array of emotions. So, it’s important that they get along well. They are in fact being trained by a diction expert for the dialect common in Agra.” If all goes as planned, Sanjay’s first shot will be canned in Agra in the second week of February.
