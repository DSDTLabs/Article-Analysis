He was part of the team that gathered from different parts of the world to campaign for AAP during the Delhi assembly elections.
 
 “A political party can never fight corruption if it can't keep its own money clean,“ said Raizada, while advising the group of NRIs, who have arrived to support AAP in  , to rethink over their decision.
 
 He and other NRIs staged a silent protest holding up banners with slogans like: “We are ashamed that AAP has fielded maximum (16) tainted candidates“, and “No list, no donation“. The group is calling their protest, “Chanda Band Satyagrah(No Donation Campaign)“.Raizada, who has been suspended from AAP, regretted that those who had come to change politics had become “a part of the same dirty game“.
 
 The NRIs intend to continue their `No Donation Campaign' in Punjab right up till the assembly elections.
