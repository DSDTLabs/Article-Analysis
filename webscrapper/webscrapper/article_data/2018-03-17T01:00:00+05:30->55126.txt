However, instead of confronting her, he maintains a stoic calm and starts blackmailing her lover. The song has quirky lyrics by  , with the rap portions penned by Divine and Dhaval Purab. 
 
 The film’s director,  , said, “Songs can add tremendous value to storytelling, if done in the right manner. I am very particular about my songs. Kudos to the music team for getting the brief of 'Badla' spot on.” Producer   adds, “We’re excited to present this revenge rap. At T-Series, we are constantly trying to buck the trend and 'Badla' is an example of this. Cheers to the team and I hope that the audience loves the song.”
