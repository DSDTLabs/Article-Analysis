TRICHY: A 38-year-old driver died while the cleaner sustained grievous injuries as a container carrying metal components slid from the trailer and fell over the truck’s cabin near the Ariyamangalam flyover in   on Wednesday evening. The incident caused a bottleneck in vehicular movement along the Thanjavur-Trichy stretch of National Highway 67 for at least a couple of hours.

 Police sources said that the truck started from the BHEL premises near   on Wednesday evening with finished metal components and was heading to Chennai reportedly for the setting up of a power plant in  . They said that a two-member crew of the truck, identified as Bharathiraja, 28, and Manikandan, 38, hailing from Trichy were in the cabin. The truck was on course to reach the Trichy-Chennai NH via Palpannai. While approaching the Ariyamangalam flyover, the truck driver, Manikandan, applied sudden brakes which apparently caused the metal container in trailer to slid and plunge on the truck’s cabin.
 
 Subsequently, Manikandan died on the spot while the cleaner, Bharathiraja, sustained severe injuries. “With such heavy vehicles plying on the stretch on a daily basis, there is no assurance for our lives. What if the container fell on commuters plying close to the truck instead of plunging on the cabin?” S  , a commuter heading to the TVS tollgate said.
 
 As the accident caused traffic congestion between Palpannai and Thiruverumbur, the Ariyamangalam police with the help of fire service personnel cleared the traffic congestion. The city police said that further investigation is under way. The injured cleaner was being treated at a private hospital in the city.
