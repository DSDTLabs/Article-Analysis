MUMBAI: In an obvious reference to the  , CM   on Saturday said that he doesn’t fear the tiger and with the power given to him by the people, he will move forward with the strength of 100 lions and rip apart the corrupt system in the BMC.

 “I am a devotee of  , so I don’t fear the tiger. I have the guts to walk into the den of a tiger and count his teeth. The one who roars inside this den is not a tiger, they need to get out and face the public,” said Fadnavis at a not-so-crowded rally at Somaiya grounds in Chunabhatti.
 
 Fadnavis also made a slew of announcements at the final election rally. He said that slum-dwellers will be rehabilitated in 305sqft homes instead of the current 269sqft. “Until now, Marathi manoos was being evicted under the name of SRA projects but from now on, the government will undertake these projects so that the original owners do not face any inconvenience,” he said. 
 
 He said the state will prepare a plan for redevelopment of koliwadas and also slums on forest and airport lands will. “We have got permissions to construct 50,000 homes on the airport land.” 
 
 Officials said that it is unlikely that these sops may be considered as violation of the code of conduct as the policies were declared earlier and only the finer details were announced at the rally.
 
 Targetting the Shiv Sena, Fadnavis said Uddhav Thackeray’s speeches are like covering fire, they are meant to confuse than convince the voters.
 
 “All through the poll campaigns, I have been waiting for Uddhav to talk about development and projects but he has only spoken on emotional issues to divert attention from his incompetency,” said Fadnavis.
