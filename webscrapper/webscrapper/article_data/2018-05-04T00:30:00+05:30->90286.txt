Tuticorin: Minister for information and publicity Kadambur C Raju said that the AIADMK government would impose total prohibition before the end of their five-year tenure. He was responding to the suicide note left behind by 17-year-old Dinesh Nallasivan, asking the chief minister to close all liquor outlets in the state. Dinesh hung himself from the railway over bridge on the South Bypass Road in Tirunelveli city as he was upset over his father’s addiction to liquor.

 Expressing grief over his suicide, the minister said this incident will definitely create awareness among parents who are alcoholics and urge them to give up their addiction. “The government will do some pariharam (penance) to compensate the loss of the boy’s life for prohibition. The government has earmarked Rs28 crore for creating awareness among the public on the ill effects of consuming alcohol. We have also identified various de-addiction centres across the state to help alcoholics come out of the addiction,” he said and added that liquor shops will be closed in a phased manner.
 
 On the controversial video advertisement that referred the chief minister as God, the publicity minister said that the words came from the heart of a disabled woman, who featured in the advertisement, as she was overwhelmed by the schemes implemented by the government. He added that the advertisement was removed as it attracted strong criticism.
 
 Raju refused to comment on the Cauvery Management Board issue, stating that it is sub-judice. He was interacting with reporters at Kovilpatti after taking part in the pillar laying ceremony for an event in which chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami will participate in the town on May 11. Adi dravida and tribal welfare minister V M Rajalakshmi and district collector N Venkatesh also participated in the event.
