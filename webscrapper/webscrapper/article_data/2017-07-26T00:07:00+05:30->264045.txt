Indore: The visitors at Indore   will soon get to see two new enclosures –   and monkey island. As part of the zoo’s master plan, authorities with Indore municipal corporation (IMC) will get the two enclosures constructed by the end of this year. 

 “The snake house will be meant for all the reptiles,” said the zoo education officer and curator Nihar Parulekar. He said that the zoo has more than 25 reptiles and officials have planned to keep all of them in separate enclosures in the snake house. 
 
 “The idea behind shifting of all the reptiles is to provide visitors an opportunity to seen and differentiate among several species under one roof,” said Parulekar.
 
  He said that at present, the enclosures for snakes, gharial, common iguana, crocodile, tortoise and lizards are not close to each other. And visitors need to go to different enclosures to see them. 
 
 Similarly, zoo authorities also plan to develop a monkey island, where all the monkeys will be kept at an open space. “We really want to bring special elements to the zoo to reward visitors, besides, keeping the animals happy,” said zoo in-charge Uttam Yadav.
 
  “We are going with tendering process to finalise an agency for construction of the enclosures as per our requirements. The estimated cost of the two projects is Rs 2 crore,” said officials.
