GORAKHPUR: Congress vice president   attacked   for waiving off loans of   and few industrialists but not doing the same for farmers.

 He was addressing an election rally at Padrouna in Kushinagar on Wednesday. “Modi ji promised youths to provide employment but he didn't. I approached him as leader of opposition with the appeal of two crore farmers and asked him to waive off their loans and he responded with silence. He can waive off Rs 1,200 crore of Vijay Mallya and of other industrialists but can't waive off loans of dying farmers?“ “I want to ask him why he needs to form BJP government in UP to waive off loans. As a PM he could do it as when   ji was PM he waived off farmers' loan. Farmers in Kushinagar asked him to open another sugar mill but he didn't. He could waive off loan to Mallya who sold liquor,“ Rahul added.
 
 On Cong-SP alliance, Rahul said, “Modi ji has become frustrated over my friendship with Akhilesh and has started spreading hatred. I appeal to my party workers who are the backbone of the party to help SP candidate win and also appeal to SP people to help Congress candidates win from their seats.“
