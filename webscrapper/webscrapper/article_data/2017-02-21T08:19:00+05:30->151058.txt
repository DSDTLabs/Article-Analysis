GURUGRAM: A forest officer and a forest guard have been suspended, after more than 1,000 trees were cut in   near  .

 As per forest department sources, nearly 600 grown trees and 400 bushes were felled by a real estate company to carry out a project in the area. However, the forest department’s figure is a mere 469 trees.
 
 “We’ve suspended a forest guard and an officer. The company applied for transplantation of 20 trees, which didn’t take place. The two employees were to supervise the transplantation. We carried out the inquiry after receiving a complaint from a resident,” M D  , conservator of forest (Gurgaon circle) told TOI.
 
 According to complainant  , the trees were cut after a recent takeover of the land by a real estate company. “The company recently purchased around seven acres in Chauma village from another company. Since October 2016, it has been indiscriminately felling trees and mesquite bushes from the parcels of land located on the revenue road that runs from the railway crossing connecting Palam Vihar to Chauma, and goes to  ,” said Talwar in his complaint (a copy is with TOI).
 
 Talwar added attempts were made to burn the felled trees to bury evidence. “The tree debris is being burnt in the open. Therefore, I requested the department to take action against the offenders,” he said.
 
 Located just 8km from the city, the area in question is spread across 12 acres. As the land falls under general Section 4 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) 1990, any kind of tree felling, without approval from concerned authorities, is illegal.
 
 With Google Earth images making it evident that over 1,000 trees and bushes have been felled, the forest department is promising strict action. It plans to send notices to all parties, and move   if required. 
 
 Three months ago, the DTCP enforcement wing demolished an illegal colony over the same piece of land in Chauma, where an abandoned factory stands.
