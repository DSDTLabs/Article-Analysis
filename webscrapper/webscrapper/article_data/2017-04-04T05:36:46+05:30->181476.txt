JODHPUR: Instances of child marriages continue despite plenty of   and  , both by administration and the judiciary. Recent intervention by the judiciary to stop four such marriages in   shows that though every action is being taken to curb them but the   is hard to be abolished.

 The timely information and prompt action by the legal service authority, however, helped in stopping marriages of three minor girls and one minor boy in Osian. According to social workers, there will be many more such marriages that will take place by misleading the system.
 
 With less than a month to go for ‘Akshaya Tritiya’ (an otherwise auspicious day for weddings but notorious for child marriages), cases of child marriages will also increase.
 
 Meanwhile, the judiciary has, like always, initiated awareness campaigns in the rural areas to help people understand the ill-effects. Administration has also stepped up efforts to ensure that not a single   takes place around this time.
 
 District administration has constituted village and tehsil-level committees to keep an eye on child marriages in their respective areas.
 
 “While the village-level committee would comprise gram sevak, area patwari and beat constable of the region’s police station, the tehsil-level committee would comprise tehsildar, block development officer and the SHO,” said district magistrate B C Mallik.
 
 Similarly, a vigilance group has also been constituted to coordinate with these committees. This group will comprise sub-divisional officer, circle officer and programme officer of women and child development.
