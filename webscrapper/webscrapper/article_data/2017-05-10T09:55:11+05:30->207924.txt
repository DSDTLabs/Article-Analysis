 Mahesh first complained of breathlessness and uneasiness four years back. Tests showed that he had a 14cm tumour inside his heart. Majority of tumours in the heart are benign but doctors at a multispecialty government hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, who operated on him from the side of the heart, found that his tumour was cancerous.
 
 However, the tumour couldn't be completely removed due to which he was advised radiation and chemotherapy. Though initially he was fine, later he again developed uneasiness and breathlessness. This time the tests showed that the tumour had grown again and increased in size.
 
 The patient then consulted a well-known oncologist in the city and he advised him to consult a cardiac surgeon to explore the possibility of removing the tumour completely by operation. Mahesh then approached Renai MediCity, Kochi.
 
 "After going through his reports we were worried if we would be able to remove the tumour completely and even informed the family of the same. But the family was supportive as they realised that he may not have any relief if the tumour is not removed," added
