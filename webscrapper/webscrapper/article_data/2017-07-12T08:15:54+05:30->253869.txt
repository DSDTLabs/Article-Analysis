The long pending decision to set up   for industries is the first step towards implementing ‘UP Industrial Policy-2017’ launched a week ago. In the   announced on Tuesday, the government allocated Rs 10 crore to set up initial structure and technological equipment required for commencing an integrated online single-window clearance for investment in UP.

  UP State Council chairman Jay Agarwal said, “The new system will help many who wanted to set up industry in UP but were discouraged to make rounds of various government departments for approval and if the government implements it strictly, entrepreneurs could get approval from various departments like Pollution Control Board, labour office, GST and weights & measurements departments at one place.”
 
 Association for MSME (Ministry of Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises) of IIA (Indian Industries Association), however, is disappointed with no   for their sector. Its national president said, “There is no allocation for MSMEs despite it being one of the largest employment generating sectors in UP. We appreciate government allocating Rs 20 crore for its Industrial Investment & Employment Generation policy but that would benefit only industries with turnover above Rs 50-100 and employing up to 50-100 persons. Our sector doesn’t provide such an opportunity.”
 
 A Special Investment Board is also proposed with initial funds of Rs 5 crore to help bring investments in state. IIA former president Manish Goel said, “This will help companies solve problems of land availability, taxes, subsidies and providing more SEZs but initial allocations under various heads is too less.”
