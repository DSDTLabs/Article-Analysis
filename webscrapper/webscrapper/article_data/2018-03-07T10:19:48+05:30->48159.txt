LUDHIANA: A man had a narrow escape when a train ran into his car near   railway station, 20 kilometres from here, early on Tuesday. 

 The driver, who was reportedly drunk, was trying to cross the railway track when his car (PB10 AL 8870) got stuck. 
 
 City station traffic inspector   said, “The car driver, who is yet to be identified, was inebriated and did not realise when his vehicle veered towards the railway track. He ran out when his car got stuck and he saw an approaching train. The train dragged the car for about 800 metres.” 
 
 The collision, which took place around 4.45am, left the car entangled with the   engine. “The railway officials took more than an hour to disengage the two,” Sharma added. 
 
 The accident halted rail traffic on the busy   route for over an hour. 
 
 Division operating manager   said, “The   have registered a case against the car driver. More than a thousand passengers were aboard the Jammu-bound train. It’s difficult to stop the train with emergency brakes which can lead to collision among its different coaches.”
