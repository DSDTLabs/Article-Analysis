PANAJI: The Goa Investment Promotion Board (IPB) has been reconstituted, with five new industry members being inducted into the 12-member body. An announcement through a gazette notification is expected shortly, sources said.

  According to officials, although the term of the IPB’s six industry representatives had expired in October 2016, they were given temporary extensions. President of the Manufacturers’ Association for Information Technology (MAIT) Nitin Kunkolienkar, Pai Kane Group chairman and promoter Atul Pai Kane, and Goa Chamber of Commerce & Industry president Narayan Bandekar, are among those who made way for Atrey Sawant, Ernest Dias, Yatin Kakodkar, Girish Bharne and Rajkumar Kamat. 
 
 MD and chairman of KINECO, Kaman Shekhar Sardessai, however, has retained his position on the IPB. 
 
 The board, which will be chaired by chief minister  , will also include tourism minister and MGP MLA  , and information and technology minister  . Secretaries for tourism and industry, and CEO Ashton Godinho, are its other members. 
 
 “We will try and hold a meeting after the board is formally notified. It will probably meet for the first time to set the agenda for the next few years. A review of the approvals given might also be taken. 
 
 “As a new board is taking over, projects may not be taken up for approval. It all depends on the chief minister’s availability,” a source said.
