PATNA:   is keen to ensure a larger stature for its leader and former deputy CM   following JDU’s exit from the grand alliance. Tejashwi, who has been praised for his speech in the state assembly, will soon hit the roads to undertake his padyatra from  , a place associated with Mahatma Gandhi’s Satyagraha movement.
 
  While RJD chief   is preparing for the August 27 rally in which many Opposition leaders are likely to participate, Tejashwi’s main task is to target the state government. RJD chief has also invited senior   leaders to join his party to strengthen Opposition against BJP in the state. RJD is also believed to be keeping a close eye on Union minister Upendra Kushwaha’s RLSP and ex-CM Jitan Ram Manjhi’s HAM. Both the parties, which are NDA allies in Bihar, have not got any representation in the new ministry.
