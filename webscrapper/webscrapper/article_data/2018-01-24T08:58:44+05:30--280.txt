MADIKERI: In a big setback for the   (Secular) which is trying to make inroads into Kodagu district, former minister and senior party leader  , who enjoys significant clout among district voters, is likely to quit the party and join the   before the assembly elections.

  (DCC) president Shivu Madappa confirmed that the party invited the veteran leader to join. Nanaiah i s likely to join the Congress in the presence of senior party leaders in Bengaluru soon.
 
 Fuelling speculation, Nanaiah declined to either confirm or deny the rumours. “I want a secular government even after the 2018 assembly election. I got an invitation from the Congress and BJP in 2014, following the JD(S)’s decision not to re-select me to the state legislative council,” Nanaiah told TOI.
 
 Sources in the JD(S) said Nanaiah is upset with the party’s state leadership on probable candidates for both constituencies of the district. The Congress, which has failed to open its account in the past 15 years in Kodagu, wants to use Nanaiah's influence to win at least one constituency in this election.
 
 Speculation began on January 9 when chief minister Siddaramaiah visited Nanaiah’s residence with a few local Congress leaders. Sources said the CM spent around 45 minutes with Nanaiah. Though the CM and Nanaiah said it was a courtesy call, it is now confirmed that Nanaiah may switch to the Congress with his supporters.
