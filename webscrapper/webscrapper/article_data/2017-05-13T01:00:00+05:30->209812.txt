"I do not think young people are reading mythology any less these days. In fact, if I consider the last 20 years, ever since I have started writing, the sale of these books have only steadily gone up," said mythologist and author Devdutt Pattanaik, while attending a literary festival recently in Dehradun. From intolerance in society, his personal journey as an author to how readers are still interested in mythology,   spoke to us on a wide range of topics.

  
 While intolerance is a burning issue in the country right now, the author said that he does not feel that people have grown more intolerant in today’s world. He explained, "Human beings have always fought with each other, be it in the name of religion or something else. Intolerance has always been there. When you start talking about your rights, tab ladai hamesha hoti hai. Ek haq dene wala hai jo dena nahi chahta aur ek haq lene wala hai jo kaise bhi lena chahta hai and this results in conflict. This has always been the case, there’s nothing new about intolerance."
 
  
 Talking about his journey as a writer over the past 20 years, he shared, "My books have been selling more now than it did 20 years back. So when somebody says that the number of people reading mythology has gone down, I disagree. For me, personally, with every new book I write, the language becomes simpler and the message becomes deeper. While some of my books are works of fiction, most of them are analysis."
 
  
  
 
  
 Pattanaik shared, "For me, the state of Uttarakhand is special because it has a lot of temples and tales associated with them. In a way, in one of my books, when I wrote about the hill which the Pandavas crossed during their last journey to heaven, I drew inspiration from the hills of Dehradun and its surroundings. I have not named it in my book as I feel Dehradun is too modern a name. But that's the source of my inspiration."
