 Mehgraj Sarkar aka Megh — a second-generation magician, married to the titular character,  , who is also a magician

 Studied in Barasat Mahatma Gandhi Memorial High School, Rubel 
 graduated from Acharya Prafulla Chandra College, Madhyamgram
 
 I was a professional dancer and have been learning dance from the age of six. In 2008, I won the reality show, 
 , and then took part in 
 . I landed a job as a dance instructor at Shiamak Davar’s Institute of Performing Arts. But as luck would have it, I lost my father in 2011 and had to return to Kolkata. It was a big struggle after that. I did a film, 
 , with Pijush Saha, but it didn’t do much good to my career. Around that time, I got a call from the channel for this serial. And after the audition and look test, I was on board. What I am today is because of my dance teacher, Debasish Ghosh, who has helped me immensely, both in my personal and professional lives.
 
 This serial has made me a known face. People recognise me as Megh, be it in theatres or shopping malls, and that gives me immense satisfaction. What more can an actor ask for? While I click selfies with my fans, I tell myself that it is a huge responsibility and I have to make them proud.
