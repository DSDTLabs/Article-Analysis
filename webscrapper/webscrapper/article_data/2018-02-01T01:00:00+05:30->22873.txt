 Dosanjh, who is part of the second season of 'The Rising Star', doesn’t believe that reality shows rob child participants off their childhood. The singer-actor says, “If children are not on   shows, they are happily showcasing their talent on various online platforms. So, why blame TV alone? I started my career as a singer at the age of 18 and 
social media has played a huge part in it. For small actors who do not have a PR agency, social media is a great platform to connect directly with the audience.”
 Diljit further stresses that today a child is not a celeb only because he is singing or acting on TV. He elaborates, “Television is not the only medium, which is exploring the talent of children. Nor do they become celebs by making appearances or participating only on music reality shows. They are aware of various platforms online, where they can participate and showcase their talent. Today, children are becoming stars thanks to their talent being showcased on social media platforms. Nobody can escape this kind of attention as they are exposed to it at a young age. TV is not damaging or exploiting anything here... it is this current trend that is capturing children’s talent and putting them in the spotlight.”
