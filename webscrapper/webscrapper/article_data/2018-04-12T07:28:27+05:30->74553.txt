CHANDIGARH: Shiromani Akali Dal leader   on Wednesday alleged that the   government in Punjab had deliberately fielded a junior advocate in the   to contest the state’s case against local bodies minister   to help him walk free in the culpable homicide case.

 Majithia said it was incumbent on the Congress government to explain why it had left the family of  , who had died after Sidhu and his friend beat him up, in the lurch. “Sidhu has himself confessed to killing an innocent, unarmed old man who was not even allowed to escape because his car keys were wrenched away from him,” he alleged.
 
 The SAD leader said the victim’s family had already been saddled with the cost of litigation for decades. He alleged that now when it had come up with a compelling proof in the form of a televised self-confession by Sidhu that he was present at the scene of crime, that he had entered into an altercation with Gurnam and even landed fist blows on him leading to the latter’s death, the Punjab government has started working overtime to get Sidhu off the hook.
 
 Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda couldn’t be contacted over Majithia’s allegations as his mobile phone was switched off.
