PUNE: Sugar price may go up soon as its production in the state has nearly halved this year.

 Former union agricultural minister  , while speaking at the annual general meeting of  , said “Sugar production in Maharashtra has dipped by around 50% this year, compared to the average of the last couple of years. Lack of water, drought and other climatic issues have reduced the overall yield of sugarcane, which led to the drop in sugar production.”
 
 He said efforts are needed to increase yield per acre. New varieties of sugarcanes that consume less water and produce more sugar should be developed, he suggested.
 
 Pawar said, the state had produced around 100 lakh tonne sugar on an average in the last couple of years. This has gone down to nearly 45 lakh tonne this year. “The state currently has 70 big loss-making mills, which incurred a total loss of nearly Rs 2,400 crore this year. Last year there were 40 loss-making units, accounting for Rs 1,200 crore loss,” he said. He pointed out that poor demand for by-products has added to the worries.
 
 Chief minister   said, the state government will sign contracts with sugar mills in the state to purchase power generated by them and offer them higher rates. The sugar mills should come out with innovative technologies to generate more electricity with less financial burden, he said.
 
 Fadnavis said sugar mills need to be better managed and more transparent in management. A meeting will be held to finalise rates for the power generated in around a week’s time.
 
 “Factors like capital investment, returns and use of new technology will be considered while deciding the rates. Since the electricity generated is green it will be purchased by paying more,” he said.
