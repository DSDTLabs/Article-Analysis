Indore: Fire department officials on Saturday claimed that after the recent fire at  ,   has attached more than six tankers of 25,000 litres at the spot, which could have easily doused the flames in   in less time.

 The fire tankers which have been attached to Devguradia were provided by the IMC to the fire department.
 
 The tankers were, however, sent to Devguradia to tackle emergency situations.
 
 “The fire at Devguradia will only be doused after heavy rains. We could have used the tankers in Ranipura on Saturday as they could have helped us speed up putting out the fire,” said a fire official present at the spot.
 
 Chief superintendent   also claimed that the tankers could have helped them.
 
 “After we received information that there was a fire at a decorations shop, we sent four fire tenders from three major stations and one sub-station to the spot and the IMC was also informed about the same,” Tiwari told TOI.
 
 She added that since the tankers were small, the water finished fast and to maintain continuity, there was a need for tankers of large capacity.
 
 “Though it is difficult for big tankers to maneuver in the city, fire fighters felt the need for the tanker to keep up with dousing the flames,” said Tiwari.
 
 The fire department, however, managed to douse the flames with whatever options were available.
