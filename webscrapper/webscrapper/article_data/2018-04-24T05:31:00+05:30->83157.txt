Nagpur: BJP MLA from Katol Ashish Deshmukh has said since ruling ally Shiv Sena was opposing the proposed crude oil refinery at Nanar in Konka region, it could be shifted to Vidarbha, a centrally located place in the country. 

 The proposed plant which could be the biggest refinery of the country at a proposed investment of over Rs1 lakh crore is a joint venture of Indian public sector oil companies and some Gulf-based giants.
 
 An MoU has been signed for it. Nanar was chosen as site looking to its coastal advantage. “But the people of the area are against the unit and for political reasons Shiv Sena is supporting people there,” Deshmukh said. 
 
 On Monday, Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray held a public rally at Nanar to join the anti-refinery chorus. Thackeray mentioned Ashish Deshmukh’s name and said that chief minister Devendra Fadnavis should heed his party MLA’s plea that the refinery be shifted to Katol in Vidarbha, otherwise the big ticket investment could go to Gujarat.
 
 “Last month, I handed over a memorandum to Fadnavis for setting up the   either in Katol where 15,000 acres of land can be easily made available or anywhere else in Vidarbha,” Deshmukh said.
 
 :The plant has potential to bring about an industrial revolution as besides creating around 50,000 direct and indirect employment, it can provide raw material to synthetic yarn and cement industries. Besides, petrol and diesel will be available at least Rs 3 a litre cheaper from current prices in Vidarbha which probably pays the highest price in the country for them,” he said.
 
 “I appeal to the chief minister and our senior leader Nitin Gadkari to show the political will to bring the large refinery project to Vidarbha . A pipeline can be simultaneously laid while building the new Samruddhi Mahamarg connecting Nagpur to Mumbai to transport the crude. Vidarbha badly needs such employment avenues to stop migration of its youth,’’ Deshmukh told reporters.
