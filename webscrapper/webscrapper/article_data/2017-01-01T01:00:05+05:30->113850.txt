 actress   and her fiancé, actor  , were in town to ring in the New Year.
 
  The couple, who got engaged in August last year, consider Pune to be a pleasant getaway. “There’s nothing like welcoming the New Year with friends. We came to Pune two days ago to attend a music festival.
  
  However, as it was too crowded, we could attend only for a day,” she said. The rest of their holiday in the city has been about long walks on MG Road and catching up with old friends. “This is my second visit to the city and I am in love with its vibes. As I am from Chandigarh, I can easily relate to Pune. Both the cities are very well planned,” she shared. On one of her walks on MG Road, Mansi was mobbed by a “few aunties who wanted to click pictures” with her.
  
  
 
  
  “Pune has a large TV audience. Though Mohit and I disguised ourselves wearing glasses and caps, a few aunties recognised us and made sure we clicked pictures with them,” she laughed.
  
  The couple is also preparing for their marriage that is slated to take place in the first half of this year.
