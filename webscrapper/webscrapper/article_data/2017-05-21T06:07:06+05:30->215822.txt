NAGPUR: Four days after a   Khadan near Hansapuri, around 2000 kgs of suspected beef and 44 bovines were seized in the same area on Saturday. In the previous raid, which was hardly 100 metres away, cops had seized 200 kilograms of meat and two calves.

 A team from   reached the spot around 4.30pm after receiving a tip-off. On raiding few houses and hutment, they found meat and 44 cows, oxen and calves. “The houses were quite old and had open spaces where animals were slaughtered,” said a senior police official.
 
 The police has arrested two accused. Cops suspect that after frequent raids in areas like Kamptee and Pachpaoli, the underground business of illegal slaughtering has shifted to new places. “Earlier, we didn’t come across illegal slaughtering on such a large scale. Fearing raids, butchers have started doing it inside their houses,” police said.
 
 Members of   (VHP) claimed that the slaughtered meat is transported from Nagpur to cities like Hyderabad and Mumbai. “Nagpur has become the hot spot for illegal slaughtering as large quantity of cattle is easily available from nearby markets like   and Bhandara,” they said. 
 
 This is the third such raid in a month. On May 15, cops had arrested three accused from Khadan but they got released on bail. Samples of the seized meat were sent for laboratory testing but the results are yet to come.
