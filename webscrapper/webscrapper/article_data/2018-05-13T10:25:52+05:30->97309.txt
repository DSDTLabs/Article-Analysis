BENGALURU:   (name changed) in   earns Rs 2,000/month from every household she works as a help. However, during elections, her earnings have shot up, with workers from two major parties landing up at her doorstep, thrusting money into her hands and asking her to vote for their candidates.

 “While in previous elections we got Rs 500 per vote. This year, both   and   have each paid us Rs 1,000 per vote,” said Nagavalli.
 
 According to sources in political parties, the rates are fixed on the basis of the candidature and the “requirement” of the votes from a particular community or locality. A domestic help in BTM Layout where home minister Ramalinga Reddy is fighting   from the BJP, nephew of mining baron G Janardhana Reddy, has been given Rs 2,000 for her vote by each party.
 
 In rural areas, the money was equitably distributed across the communities and people. Primarily targeted at youngsters, parties in   reportedly sent out liquor bottles and Rs 15,000 cash to a hamlet of 300 houses.
 
 In Badami, a local taxi driver said in the past 15 days, “parties” were arranged and cash flowed freely. “Towards the end, we had been told Rs 700 per vote will be paid. In some cases, where the villages bargained hard, close to Rs 2,000 was given per vote,” he added.
 
 A new phenomenon this year was that cash was distributed on the day of polling instead of the day before as used to be the case earlier. A prime reason for this was the incessant rains which lashed Bengaluru on Friday evening.
