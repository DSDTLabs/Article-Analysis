PANAJI: Urban development minister Francis D’Souza on Thursday said the government will amend the Goa Municipalities Act to enable action against those councillors who are not filing their assets and liabilities before the Goa Lokayukta. The amendment   is likely to be introduced in the forthcoming assembly session that will commence on February 19.

 “This will ensure transparency and councillors, like MLAs, will have to declare their assets every year,” he said, adding that the amendment will make provisions to disqualify councillors who have failed to file their statements. At present, no action can be initiated against erring councillors as there is no such provision in the Act, D’Souza said. 
 
 Talking about village panchayats that have a large population, the urban development minister say it was up to the panchayat to decide whether it wants to be a municipality, as this would provide for better functioning. “It is up to a panchayat to decide. If it does not want to become a municipality, it is fine,” he added.
 
 On the topic of Goods and   (GST), D’Souza said there is no clarity, which is delaying development work in the state. Recently, chief minister   had assured both ruling and opposition MLAs Rs 25 crore in funds for carrying out development work in their respective constituencies.
