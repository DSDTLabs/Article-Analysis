JAIPUR: The state has always been known for its gold, gem and  . It’s now all set to add an unlikely element to make them more attractive and lucrative while enhancing the income of the farming sector—pearls.

 The agriculture department has decided to send a team of officials to Odisha for a week-long training programme on   for the purpose.
 
 The government has made all preparations for the pilot project which will be launched in Jaipur.
 
 “We will start   farming in Rajasthan. It has potential to give good returns to our farmers,” said agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini.
 
 A pond with brackish water has already been readied for the purpose while the construction of a state-of-the-art lab for grafting tissues from oyster shells is underway.
 
 “To start with, officials will receive training from a pearl culture institute in Bhubaneswar. From Odisha, we will also be bringing oysters and mussels to facilitate pearl cultivation,” added the minister.
 
 Senior officials of the agriculture department claimed that farmers can earn between Rs 8 lakh to Rs 10 lakh annually. “For the final result, one has to wait as a cultured pearl takes around 12-18 months to form. But it can be a major source of income if it’s done well,” the official said.
 
 To keep the pond clean, fish will be bred in the pond, which will provide food for oysters that eat leftovers. “Later these fish will provide additional income to farmers,” the official said.
 
 The government is also in process of identifying a fresh water source near Kota region to launch similar project.
 
 As per the plan, farmers from various parts of the state, who want to diversify into other areas of production, will be identified and exposed to this farming option and required technologies. Along with this, the government will also take up the task of marketing pearls.
