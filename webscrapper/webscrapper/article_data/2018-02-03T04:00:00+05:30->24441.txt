Surat: Textile traders in the country’s largest man-made fabric (MMF) wholesale market in the city received a temporary relief after the central government deferred the implementation of the requirement to carry e-permits for inter-state transportation of goods owing to technical glitches.  The traders want the government to postpone the implementation of e-way bill for six months in order to allow them to get accustomed to the new rule and also because they were still facing problems filing returns on Goods and Service Tax portal. Meanwhile, Federation Of Indian Art Silk Weaving Industry (FIASWI) has decided to convene a meeting of industry stakeholders to decide future course of action regarding the pending issues related to GST on Monday.  FIASWI chairman Bharat Gandhi told TOI, “It is a temporary relief for the textile industry as government has deferred the e-way bill’s implementation due to technical glitches. However, we are demanding that the e-way bill be postponed for six months. The textile industry stakeholders are meeting on February 5 to discuss the future course of action. The government is yet to accept our demands.”  Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (FOSTTA) president Manoj Agarwal said, “We expected the Union Budget to bring relief to the textile sector, but it has failed our expectations. It’s good that the e-way bill has been deferred, but the government will launch once the technical glitches are removed. We want the e-way bill to be extended for another six months.” Pandesara Weavers Association president Ashish Gujarati said, “The key demands of power loom weaving sector, including refund on input tax credit and credit on opening stock, are not addressed by this government. The power loom weaving sector is operating on losses.”
