THANE: Jonathan D’souza (11) did not eat for almost three days and kept crying after his five-month-old pet dog went missing for three days had tears of joy when he saw Furry roaming in the living room of his   home as soon as he got home on Thursday night.

 The pup was found in Yeoor on Thursday by an alert tribal who found her crouching beneath a small cave. Furry had gone for a late-night walk with her owners near Upvan Lake on Tuesday when she went missing. 
 
 “Furry and I were running together when the slamming of a car door scared her,” said Jonathan. “She stopped suddenly, due to which I tripped and fell. The leash slipped out of my hand and she started running. A few strays started barking at her and she ran towards Yeoor,” said Jonathan.
 
 The worried family contacted a local NGO, Pet Owners and Animal Lovers (PAL), for help as they had adopted the dog from them.
 
 “We put up posters in English and Marathi,” said Aditi Nair, founder of PAL. “We searched early mornings and late evenings as it is at these times that dogs come out of their hiding places.”
 
 Jonathan’s maternal grandfather, Sydney Putman, too scouted for Furry. “My dad asked a few tribals about Furry and requested them to contact us,” said Jonathan’s mother, Sandra.
 
 After almost two days, Jonathan was told that Furry might not be alive as leopards could have eaten her. “We didn’t want to build up his hopes,” said Sandra. “On Thursday evening, we got a call from a tribal, Lata Lokhande, who said she had spotted Furry and asked us to come over,”
 
 “When Lokhande, a maid, spotted Furry who had a leash on her, she quickly put it on a branch so that Furry couldn’t run away. Lokhande who does not have a cellphone borrowed one from a local and called our number which was put up on a poster,” said Nair. “Furry was sitting under a cave there and came running on seeing us.”
