PANAJI: The   ( ) has approved   department’s petition to continue with the existing   for all consumers. The department didn’t propose any hike in the existing tariff structure for 2017-18.

 The department had tried to apply a lower tariff for educational institutions, but the commission stated that these consumers already fall under the (high tension) HT industrial category whose tariff is considerably lower than the tariff of HT commercial category.
 
 “There is no further requirement of reduction in tariff for these consumers,” the commission stated.
 
 The commission has also decided to bill small hotels and restaurants with lodging and boarding facilities under the Low Tension (LT) — Mixed/LTP (hotel industries) category only after they produce a certificate from the tourism department stating that they are registered under the Goa Registration of Tourist Trade Act, 1982 and are in the hotel business on a regular basis.
 
 “On receipt of the certificate such tariff shall be made effective from the date of original validity of the certificate. In case of failure to produce the certificate the same shall be considered under commercial category,” the commission has stated in its order.
 
 During the recent JERC public hearing, stakeholders stated that they couldn’t avail of this concessional tariff because of the delay in receiving the certificate from the tourism department resulting in confusion on the applicability of the tariff.
 
 The commission also observed that the government has approved the entire revenue gap of Rs 281.65 crore to be met by budgetary support and approved this.
 
 Consumers at the recent JERC hearing pointed out that the department although it didn’t overburden consumers by increasing tariffs was indirectly taking money from the consumers by depending on budgetary support to meet its revenue gap.
 
 The department in the state that has a large tourism industry should in fact be making a profit, stakeholders had pointed out.
