Gambling or betting of any kind is illegal in India. However, there are still a number of online and offline gambling agents running this multi-crore business in the country. 

 The government has so far remained unsuccessful in curbing the   in the country, but the demonetization of November 2014 surely dealt a severe blow to the local form of gambling. 
 
 Gujarat, which is believed to be the hub of 'Matka' business, used to generate approximately Rs 700 crore on a daily basis through  . After PM Modi's surprise announcement of the ban on Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, many of these 'Matka' shops found their business had been hit by 25 per cent within 24 hours. 
 
 Not only this, many of the hawala channels through which these illegal gambling take place, had also shut operations. As per Ahmedabad Mirror report, many of the websites and about 700-800 'Matka' shops were closed in Ahmedabad alone due to the cash shortage. 
 
 There are 12 different bazaars or operators of matka gambling - Time Bazaar, Diamond, Milan Day, Rajdhani Day, Kalyan, Milan Night, Rajdhani Night, Main Mumbai, 'Main Mumbai Day, New Milan Day, News Express and Malamal.
 
 In Goa, 'Kalyan' and 'Main Mumbai', which are believed to be the most popular bazaars generating crores of rupees in turnovers per day, shut down their operations post demonetization. As per sources, both the bazaars in Goa were shut down due to difficulties in obtaining currency of lower denominations. 
 
 Most of the online matka operators with monthly turnover running into hundreds of crores across the country have also shut down their business in just one week of demonetization. The last time the pots were smashed was during Emergency in 1977. 
 
 However, with the cash liquidity back in the market, the multi-crore matka gambling business is once again on the rise. The government has formed an Special Investigation Team (SIT) to check and curb the Matka gambling business in the country.
