LUCKNOW: The special investigation team constituted to probe   officer Anurag Tewari’s death interacted with his family members on Wednesday night for two hours. 

 However, the men in uniform failed to quell the family’s doubts. They said Tewari never went for morning walks. He also would not have stepped out to buy cigarettes as new packets were found in his bag, said Tewari’s brother. 
 
 Circle   of Hazratganj DySP Avanish Mishra, who is heading the SIT, reached Tewari’s house in   late on Wednesday night along with SHO of Hazratganj police station Anand Kumar Shahi.
 
 They met his eldest brother  , mother Sushila and sister-in-law Sunita and family friend PN Shukla.
 
 The family asked the police to visit Bengaluru to find out why Tewari was “avoiding” work since December 2016, soon after he was posted as commissioner food and civil supplies.
 
 Having completed 10 years of service, the 2007 batch officer from Karnataka had never gone on unwarranted leaves, they said. According to the family, Tewari had been extending his leaves and would stay away from Bengaluru often.
 
 The family also asked the team to show them photographs of the crime scene.
 
 The 36-year-old officer was found dead outside the VIP guest house on   on May 17. An FIR under murder charges has been registered against unknown persons thereafter.
