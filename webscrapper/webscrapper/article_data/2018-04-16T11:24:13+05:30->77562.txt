 has been busy shooting back to back films this year. She is currently shooting for Anubhav Sinha’s Abhi Toh Party Shuru Hui Hai in Lucknow, and is also promoting her upcoming release,  . 

 'Daasdev' is the modern interpretation of Devdaas, directed by Sudhir Mishra with a stellar cast starring Richa Chadha, Rahul Bhatt, Aditi Rao Hydari, Saurabh Shukla and Vinit Kumar Singh to name a few.
 
  Chadha who plays Paro in the film is not only Devdaas’ lover but also his competition. During the prep for this film, apart from understanding the landscape of UP politics, learning the body language of politicians and the dialect from the region, Richa also researched on many women MPs and MLA’s for her role in the film.
 
 Her look is inspired by various powerhouse women in politics like Sonia Gandhi, Poonam Mahajan and Dimple Yadav. We cannot wait to see her avatar in the film and hope her role is as strong as the women who have inspired it. Sources say, “The film is set against a strong set up of politics in hinterland India. In this take of Devdas with a twist, the women specially the role of Paro is shown to be a strong woman who takes on Dev in the game of politics. Richa’s character was etched taking references of appearances of several established woman political leaders to show authenticity to the character”.
