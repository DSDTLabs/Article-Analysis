PANAJI: Drishti Lifesaving Services (DLS) Private Limited, which took up the responsibility of cleaning beaches at the behest of the tourism department about a fortnight ago, said it has cleared most of the garbage that was left behind by revellers during the last 15 days across the 38 beach stretches and has started regular beach-cleaning work.

 As many as 222 labourers —110 in North Goa and 112 in South Goa — are employed on a daily basis to clean the beaches. Collection is done between 9am to 6pm and workers are given gloves, masks and safety jackets, explained DLS managing director Ankit Somani.
 
 The government has requested Drishti to temporarily clean the beaches of the state after the tourism department failed to come up with an alternative arrangement as its agreements with beach contractors stood terminated earlier last month. The department was flooded with complaints about beaches being dirty and tourists turning away due to the litter.
 
 Somani said the government had asked them to clean the beaches on a temporary basis. “We have an existing framework to effectively carry out the exercise,” said Somani, adding that beach shack operators have been extremely helpful. They segregate their waste.
 
 Drishti has hired eight trucks for transporting waste, besides using some of their own vehicles. The waste collected is transported to the Saligao waste treatment plant. Since December 17, last year, the agency has transported 94,080 kg waste to the Saligao plant. Between January 1 to 3, Drishti has collected 8,860 kg waste due to the heavy rush of tourists.
 
 Somani said that at present, garbage is collected once a day, but if required, it can be done twice. “Our men constantly monitor the beaches. Besides, if our lifeguards spot anyone throwing waste on the beach, they ask them not to do so and show them the dustbin,” he added.
