Nagpur: Central reserve police force (CRPF) has initiated a unique means of paying tribute to their martyrs and also connecting with the masses in the process to spread awareness revolving around the nationalism underlined by service to the nation. The paramilitary force top brass has decided to install statue of their martyrs from the various units at their school. On Friday, bust of a martyr from city would be installed at Adarsh Saraswati Sadan high school. 

 Devi Das Masram, a CRPF constable, had laid down his life fighting against terrorists in Kashmir in a bid to free hostages from a hotel. The martyr, a resident of Seminary hill, was a student of Adarsh Saraswati Sadan high school where his half bust statue would be installed by Deputy inspector general of police AP Singh. 
 
 Masram’s bust would be among the 10 such statues of the martyrs which would be installed at the different schools in Vidarbha. On December 22 last year, two more busts of martyrs Vijay Titare and Ishwar Nagpure were installed in city. Apart from city, busts of different martyrs are slated to be installed at Gondia, Chandrapur and Wardha too. The families of the martyrs, who performed the supreme sacrifice for the nation, are also invited to be present on the occasion. 
 
 Apart from terrorist attacks, several martyrs are also the ones who had laid down their lives while fighting against rebel forces like Naxals and also insurgency in the disturbed north eastern region.
 
 According to CRPF personnel, the main objective of the initiative is to ensure that the students are motivated to join the services to sacrifice for the nation. The CRPF senior officials would also address the students to highlight the tenets of nationalism and efforts of the CRPF’s various units and the personnel deployed.
