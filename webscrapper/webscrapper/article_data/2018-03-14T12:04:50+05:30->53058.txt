PANAJI: The two boys who received kidney transplants on Saturday and Sunday, after   and Hospital (GMC) resumed its kidney transplant programme, are recuperating at GMC. 

 The boys, both in their early twenties and hailing from   and  , have been kept in isolation in a sterile environment. They are under vigorous, around-the-clock surveillance by a team of doctors, nurses and attendants. The family members, including their mothers, who are the donors, are not yet permitted to visit the boys.
 
 “There is minute-by-minute monitoring,” head of nephrology department Dr   said, adding that kidney transplants are not ordinary surgeries. “We usually keep a gap of at least one week between two kidney transplant operations, but this time we conducted two transplants on consecutive days,” he said.
 
 The live donor kidney transplant programme at GMC was restarted on March 10 after a hiatus of around one and a half years. The two live donor kidney transplants were conducted jointly by the departments of nephrology, urology and anesthesiology. These are the fifteenth and sixteenth live donor kidney transplants conducted at the hospital since the programme commenced in October 2011.
 
 There are four kidney recipient and donor pairs on whom medical investigations are being conducted. No sooner the team devoting their attention to the two patients is relieved, they will be able to take on the next few transplant cases lined up.
 
 To ensure that their bodies do not reject the transplanted organ, the boys will be on immunosuppressant drugs for life. The dosage of these will be tapered over time. 
 
 The department will also ensure that the boys come in for regular checkups after the transplant.
