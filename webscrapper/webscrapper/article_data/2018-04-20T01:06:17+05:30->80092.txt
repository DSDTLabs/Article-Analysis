Tirupur: The postal department has suspended a temporary postman in connection with the dumping of letters and as many 138 Aadhaar cards along the Parambikulam Aliyar Project (PAP) canal near Alagumalai. Gopalakrishnan, employed as a part-time postman with Gandhinagar sub-post office, was suspended after his substitute didn’t deliver the postal articles and dumped them along the PAP canal. A bunch of Aadhaar cards and postal letters from government offices were found in a sack along the PAP canal near Alagumalai recently. Tirupur south tahsildar Gopalakrishnan seized the bundle and found that they were supposed to be delivered through the Gandhinagar sub-post office. On Wednesday, a two-member team from the Unique Identification Authority of India, regional office, Bengaluru, conducted an inquiry. Another inquiry by the revenue department found that the dumped Aadhaar cards were allocated to mail deliverer Gopalakrishnan. But as Gopalakrishnan was on leave, he had deputed his friend Rahul to perform his duties. “But Rahul did not deliver the articles and dumped them near the canal. The rule is that the postman should take moral responsibility for the mistake of his substitute. So, Gopalakrishnan was placed under suspension,” said S Gopinathan, superintendent of post offices, Tirupur division. “We have delivered most of the Aadhaar cards and other articles on Thursday. Those could not be delivered will be returned to respective authorities,” he added.
