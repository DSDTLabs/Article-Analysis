Nagpur: It seems MSEDCL officials are not only callous towards solving the problems of common citizens but also of its own employees. Arun Vyawhare, a retired discom employee, who is suffering from Parkinson’s disease is yet to get pension after two years.

 Vyawhare had taken voluntary retirement in December 2015 as he had contracted the disease. He was promised all possible help by the senior officials. However, as soon as he retired his woes started.
 
 MSEDCL head office did not clear his file for providing gratuity, superannuation and provident fund for 10 months. It was only after TOI highlighted Vyawhare’s plight that he got his dues. However, his pension is yet to start.
 
 Arun’s son Amit said that after 9 months, the MSEDCL head office told his father that the spelling of his name in the PAN card and pension form was different and hence pension file was stuck up. “This is inhuman. This should have been conveyed to us within 15 days. How can this take 9 months. We nevertheless sent a corrected form immediately,” Amit told TOI.
 
 Now Vyawhare’s pension is stuck up because MSEDCL failed to pay the premium of Employees Provident Fund Organization (EPFO). Whenever, Vyawhare contacts the concerned officials they say that they would pay the amount soon but it has not been done since months.
