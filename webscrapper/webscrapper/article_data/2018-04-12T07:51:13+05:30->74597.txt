LUCKNOW: Saying that   has no moral right to celebrate the birth anniversary of Dalit icon BR  , BSP chief   said on Wednesday that under the ruling party in the Centre and in various states, Dalits have been living under a cloud of fear.

 Ambedkar’s birth anniversary is celebrated on April 14. With the Lok Sabha elections less than a year away, all parties, including the BJP, have planned grand celebrations this year.
 
 
 “Ambedkar is the messiah of the same people who were first forced to protest due to an environment of terror created by the government, and who were then arrested for the same protest and forced to bear more harassment by the same BJP government. Ambedkar’s real identity is connected with the crores of his followers and their trials and tribulations, their freedom from casteism and their upliftment. A government which ignores these issues cannot promise a welfare state,” she said, referring to the arrests of several Dalits in the aftermath of the April 2 protests against revision of the SC/ ST Act. Such was the fear of the government and of harassment, especially in UP and  , that people are scared of even celebrating Baba Saheb’s birth anniversary on April 14, the BSP chief alleged.
 
 “BJP’s specialty has been communalism, votebank politics and to use religion for politics. It is ironical that the same government which is forced to chant Ambedkar’s name has left no stone unturned in harassing the thousands of his followers and depriving them of their constitutional and legal rights. Will you call his love towards Ambedkar and Dalits? Instead of talking about Dalits or going to villages to spend a night in their homes, BJP should give proof of its good intentions towards Dalits,” she said.
