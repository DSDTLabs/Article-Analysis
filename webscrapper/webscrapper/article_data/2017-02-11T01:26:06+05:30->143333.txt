MUMBAI: Motorists, using the   creek   that was partly shut in September to fix a crack, will have to face traffic jams for another four to five months as   work began on Friday. Long traffic snarls were witnessed on Friday as the bridge, also known as   bridge, was shut for an hour for inspection.

 Currently, north-bound light vehicles run on the bridge under speed restrictions (20 kmph) and heavy vehicles are diverted on south bridge after every 15 minutes. “We are trying to finish the work in three months,” said an official.
