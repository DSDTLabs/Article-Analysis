VIJAYAWADA: Telugu Desam Party (TDP) supremo and   chief minister N   on Monday lashed out at   and said the latter was merely an MP and president of a political party and has no right to meddle in the affairs of any state including AP. 

 
 Naidu was referring to the charge levelled by Amit Shah in Delhi on Sunday that the TDP government did not submit utilisation certificates to the Centre for the amount that was granted to it for various projects. Addressing the second day of the TDP Mahanadu here on Monday, Naidu said, "I had already told Prime Minister   that all central funds will be accounted for. If the PM or any official in his office talk about this, I can understand. But Amit Shah has no locus standi on the affairs of administration involving the Centre and states."
 
 In any case, the AP CM said at the Mahanadu that the utilisation certficates were certified by Niti Aayog and fumed at Amit Shah's charge that they were self-certified. "This is objectionable. When the Niti Aayog clearly endorsed all our certificates, Amit Shah has no business to question their authenticity. How can Shah interfere in an administrative matter," he questioned.
 
 Naidu also rubbished the allegations of Amit Shah that the state government had not called for tenders for the construction of Amaravati. He said tenders for various works worth more than 24,000 crore, including roads and construction of various buildings to the extent of 45 lakh square feet had already been finalised. "The master plan for the capital was finalised long ago and there is no truth in saying that the master plans are lying with Singapore," he said.
