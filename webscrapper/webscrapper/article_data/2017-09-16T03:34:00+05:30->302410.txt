480 words Panaji: In a significant development, the government has finally cracked down on illegal structures in low-lying agricultural land in Merces-Chimbel, filing several first information reports (FIRs) in the matter, and issuing an order for their demolition. After years of dithering on complaints even as the reclaimed area in the eco-fragile flood plains of Mandovi and Chimbel rivers and illegal structures kept on increasing, the town and country planning (TCP) department has filed a batch of FIRs against various parties at Old Goa police station. The patches of land, reclaimed from tenanted agricultural land, illegally housed shanties in which scores of men, women and children lived under sub-human conditions with no facilities and other basic amenities. In the joint operation, while TCP has taken up the matter for action with the police, the revenue department has ordered clearing of the illegal structures with a directive to block development office (BDO) and member secretary, Goa coastal zone management authority (GCZMA) to initiate immediate action to remove all illegal structures built without permission, as required under the Goa Panchayat Raj Act. This order, which was recently issued by additional collector-I, Vikas S N Gaunekar under revenue department, also directed both authorities to send an action taken report to his office before the tenth of every month to apprise the government in the matter. A TCP official said that the operation to remove the illegal structures has received a green signal from TCP minister Vijai Sardesai after deliberations on the matter with officials. “All the illegal structures built on the said land prima facie do not have permission to build from TCP and the local body,” Gaunekar stated in his order. The area while being tenanted and agricultural also consisted of fringing mangroves, and thousands of truckloads of mud were being dumped in the marshy land in gross violation of the coastal regulations zone (CRZ) notification 2011. The deputy collector has also initiated proceedings under the land revenue code (LRC) for illegal conversion of the land. “Scrapyards had come up in the reclaimed patches over the years, huts for accommodation and other illegal activities had been erected and more than 100 persons were living in an unhygienic manner,” an official said.  The Times of India had highlighted the illegalities in a series of reports over the years, reflecting concern raised by local citizens and activists about the ramifications to the environment of ecological damage and possible flooding of low-lying areas in the surrounding areas. Social activist, Aires Rodrigues had also filed a complaint nearly a month ago regarding the rampant and unchecked reclamation and illegal activities. The flying squad had carried out inspections in 2014, 2015, 2016 and this year, too. The stop work orders were issued routinely to the property owners to halt land-filling with instructions to police to keep watch over illegal activities, but it continued sporadically. x-x-x-x-x-x-x Gfx LANDING A HEAVY BLOW * Reclaimed areas in properties bearing survey numbers – 86/l, 92/13, 32/11, 38/3, 39/l, 101/1, 89/0, 81/3, 39/3, 33/2, 38/1, 38/2, 36/5, 37/2, 6/2, 38/l, 37/4, 92/3, 8/1, 32/10, 37/5, 92/4, 92/12, 811.7/1 & 2, 37/3, 8/3, 32/2, 99/4, 101/2, 274/1, 2, 275/1-B, 275/1-C at Morombi-O-Grande, Merces * Mud-filling first started years ago on the stretch between Ribandar causeway-Merces road * Area opposite eastern side of road was also reclaimed * Tenants did it to earn income for fallow fields, although comunidade owned the land originally
