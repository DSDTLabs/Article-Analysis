NEW DELHI: With the   awarding the ‘cycle’ symbol to UP chief minister  , Samajwadi Party’s disenfranchised boss   has virtually no card left to play.

 Mulayam is out of time to float a new regional party on his own as the process takes a month at the minimum and there is no time for such a course of action. He can “acquire” an existing party and set up candidates but he will be handicapped by the lack of time in publicising such an outfit and its symbol.
 
 The other, perhaps not very palatable option given the bitterness that has marked the family feud, is to accept the Akhilesh camp’s terms that include removing brother Shivpal and close aide Amar Singh from all prominence. It would also mean reconciling to the return of cousin Ram Gopal whom Mulayam blames for “instigating” Akhilesh.
 
 If these possibilities do not work out, Mulayam may find himself severely disadvantaged in the elections as his nominees will then be forced to contest on different symbols allotted to independent candidates in various constituencies.
