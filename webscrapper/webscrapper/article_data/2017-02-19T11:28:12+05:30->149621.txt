CHANDIGARH: For the first time in the history of   ( ),   may not feature in the knockouts. The defending champions suffered a fourth straight defeat at home as   handed them a 7-0 thrashing. Saturday's result has all but ended Warriors' hopes as Lancers have sealed a semi-final berth in the process.

 The hosts couldn't make anything out of the eight penalty corners (PC) they earned. Custodian Tristan Clemons had an off day, letting in three field goals and a penalty corner, and was eventually replaced by   in the final quarter. In contrast, the Lancers' goalkeeper Andrew Charter blocked everything fired at him.
 
 Punjab got into damage-control mode as early as the 9th minute when Adam Dixon found the gap between Clemons' pad and the near post from a zero angle. With that field goal, the first quarter ended at 2-0 in favour of the visitors.
 
 Lancers' captain Moritz Fuerste stepped up to the plate in the second quarter with his 24th-minute drag-flick sounding the board to make it 3-0. The death knell for Punjab was sounded in the third quarter when two field goals took the sting out of the defending champions.
 
 First it was the unmarked Lalit Upadhyay in the 34th minute as he was allowed ample time from a sea of Punjab defenders to beat Clemens. Gurjinder Singh's overlapping run five minutes later put the final nail in the coffin. At the end of his solo run into the circle from the left, Gurjinder passed the ball onto Malak Singh. The ball lifted off Malak's stick but found Dharamvir in perfect position to just tap in.
