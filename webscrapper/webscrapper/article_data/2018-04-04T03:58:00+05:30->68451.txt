Nagpur: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s social welfare department is all set to carry out a survey to identify persons with disabilities, informed women and child welfare consultative committee chairperson Pragati Patil here on Tuesday. 

 Patil, who on Tuesday convened a first meeting of the committee, said in 2014-15, the NMC had conducted a survey and found around 7,957 persons with disabilities in the city. “But the survey was not completed and even the NMC had failed to provide disability certificates to most of them,” she said. Now, a fresh survey will be carried out to identify such people on a priority basis, she said. 
 
 In the last financial year, a budgetary provision of Rs11.65 crore (including Rs6 crore for physically challenged people) was meant for women and social welfare department. “But of the amount only Rs4.31 crore was spent,” committee’s vice-chairperson Divya Dhurde said. 
 
 Patil claimed that the NMC will also construct a state-of-the-art rehabilitation centre for physically challenged persons. Along with this, the NMC’s social welfare department will also undertake survey of homeless children in the city.
 
 Besides these projects, the committee also aims to take up special training programmes for self-help group members. 
 
 “This year the NMC will try to introduce new products in its women expo for SHGs and only SHGs registered with the civic body will be allowed to participate,” she said. For the purpose, the social welfare department will conduct zone-wise meetings with SHGs members between April 15 and April 30, she said.
 
 To a query, she said the NMC’s social welfare department will also help the SHG members to take loans from nationalized banks. The department will provide a food stall and a Xerox centre for SHGs on NMC’s premises in Civil Lines.
 
 During this fiscal, NMC is planning to construct homes for senior citizens and also 24x7 night shelter for women, she added.
