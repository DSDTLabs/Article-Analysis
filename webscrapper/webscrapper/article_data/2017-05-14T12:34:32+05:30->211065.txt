AURANGABAD: The parents of a 14-year-old girl who had been abducted by a married man on May 8 and rescued after three days are now facing the problem of getting her medically examined. 

 They are apprehensive that their daughter might have been raped by her 24-year-old abductor in Mumbai before she was rescued rescued on May 11.
 
 Fed up by the alleged dilly-dallying tactics of the MIDC Cidco police on conducting a medical test, the parents on Saturday met deputy commissioner of police (headquarters)  , who immediately issued directives for registration of offence under the the stringent sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
 
 The father of the girl told TOI that the suspect was following and harassing her whenever she stepped out of home to go to school. 
 
 “Hence, we stopped sending her to school six months ago. On May 8, my daughter was threatened with dire consequences and kidnapped by the man,” he said.
 
 The primary investigation in the case has found that the suspect made the girl steal gold and cash worth over Rs 2 lakh from her house and allegedly sold some gold to a jeweller in the   area before fleeing with the child to Mumbai.
 
 The girl was confined to a room in Mumbai, before the MIDC Cidco police detained a friend of the suspect who disclosed to them about their whereabouts.
 
 The girl’s mother said that the alleged kidnapper was brought to the police station but let off. “The police informed us on May 11 that our daughter had been rescued from a city-based mall,” she alleged.
 
 PSI  , the investigation officer, refuted the allegations, saying that the girl’s parents were not ready to give their consent for medical test of the girl, who is currently in a remand home.
 
 The parents, however, said they are at the police station and want a medical test done on their daughter.
