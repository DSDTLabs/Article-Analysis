KOLKATA:   chief minister   on Friday gave a jolt to   by deciding to back   candidate   in the   polls. While TMC can win four RS seats from the state comfortably, it is the fifth seat that is up for grabs. TMC can ensure Congress victory using its spare votes totalling 15.

 Mamata’s decision comes at a time when CPM’s legislative wing was discussing with the Congress legislature party the possibility of selecting a common candidate for this seat. TMC circles here indicated that the request to help out with one RS seat came directly from the Congress leadership. “The CM had more or less made up her mind to field five Trinamool candidates. This sudden change — to field four party candidates and leave one berth for Congress — has to do with the Congress request,” a senior Trinamool leader told TOI. Incidentally, Singhvi is representing the Bengal government in a case against the expelled Gorkha Janmukti Morcha chief Bimal Gurung.
 
 Mamata’s decision may not only help her tackle some of her niggling problems but it will also keep the secular opposition in Bengal divided. For one, it left the Bengal unit of CPM in total disarray vis-a-vis its off-and-on relationship with Congress. 
 
 CPM, which risks becoming a largely one-state party following the recent Tripura defeat, has been having a vexed internal dialogue on issue, with divisions even within state and district committees over whether to accept Congress’s hand.
 
 The move has also taken care of the strident anti-Trinamool elements within the Bengal PCC for the time being. She has shown the likes of Bengal PCC president Adhir Chowdhury that she has a direct line with the Congress high command and can strike a deal with the Gandhis as and when she chooses.
