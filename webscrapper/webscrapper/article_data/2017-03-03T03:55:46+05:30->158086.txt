AHMEDABAD: While around 26% posts are vacant in BJ Medical, Ahmedabad, the MP   in Jamnagar is battling with over 37% of its sanctioned posts remaining vacant. In the six government medical colleges in the state, of the 4,314 sanctioned posts, 28.44% posts have no appointed employees. 

 Responding to a question raised over the issue by Santrampur MLA Gendalbhai Damor, the minister of state for health and family welfare, Shankar Chaudhary, stated in a written reply that the government is making all efforts to fill the vacancies.
 
 Class I, which is for senior doctors, has 43% vacancies in the government colleges - the highest among employee categories. With 238 posts vacant in class II, the higher categories form 63% of the total 1,227 posts vacant in the six government colleges.
