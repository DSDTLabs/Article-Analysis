Shares of India’s largest stock broking firm, ICICI Securities are set to be listed on Bombay   and National Stock Exchange today, on April 4. As the shares of the company make their debut on the bourses, it will be the first time in nearly three years that an organization whose public issue remained largely undersubscribed is going to be listed on the stock exchanges.

 Before this, an undersubscribed offering made it to the bourses was in September 2015 when Prabhat Dairy listed after its   was subscribed only 0.76 times.
 The initial public offering for ICICI Securities was opened for subscription between March 22 and March 26. The price band per share was fixed to be Rs 519-520 by the company.
 
 The company had decreased the size of its IPO to little over Rs 3,500 crore after the share sale received a flat response, especially from high networth individuals. 
 The share sale of the leading brokerage firm, which was expected to raise nearly Rs 4,016 crore, received around 88 per cent subscription, including the anchor portion. 
 
 According to a statement given to the Economic Times, ICICI Securities said it has “successfully closed its proposed Offer for Sale (OFS) and raised around Rs 3,500 crore”. 
 
 This shows that the size of the initial public offer, the fourth time from the ICICI Group, has been reduced because of the initial sluggish response.
