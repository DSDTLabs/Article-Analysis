 “Forty years back, the scenario was pathetic both in terms of costumes and performance but the constant efforts of people like us changed the scenario,“ he said on the sidelines of the   for   here on Tuesday.
 
 There is a dearth of   and people are yet to realize the qualitative changes; hence they turn away from such art forms and run after popular events, he said.
 
 “When I visited Paris in 1992 for an Ottamthullal performance, they said it is a magical art form, because, unlike Kathakali, a single artist performs multiple roles with ease, but unfortunately not even a single Malayali has made such a comment so far,“ he said. Though there is a qualitative change thanks to what he calls the `Kalamandalam style' in the thullal performance, many people follow their own style thus failing to bring about uniformity, he opined.
 
 When asked why there are no experiments using new works instead of classical texts by Kunjan Nambiar, he said the writings of Nambiar are relevant even today and hence there is no need to experiment with other works.
