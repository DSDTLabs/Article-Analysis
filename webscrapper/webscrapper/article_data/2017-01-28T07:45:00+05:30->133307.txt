GURUGRAM: Twelve days ago, the main waste water drain in   of   started leaking profusely after getting ruptured. With no   taken to repair the leak, sewage water has overflown into the internal roads. Not only do residents have to bear the stench encompassing the entire area, they also face the imminent danger of an epidemic outbreak. 

 Residents have complained they find it impossible to walk without treading stinking pools of sewage that have stagnated on the streets. Those living on the ground floor have it even worse — they have to take measures to avoid the muck seeping in. “The entire area is smelling of sewage. Not just that, the dirty water has entered our homes too. It won’t be long when the entire population will be down with water-borne diseases like diarrhoea or typhoid,” said Manish Singhal, a resident of the area. Civic commissioner V Umashankar said, “We’ll take immediate action.”
 
  Given past record, only time can tell if the stinking issue will be resolved soon.
