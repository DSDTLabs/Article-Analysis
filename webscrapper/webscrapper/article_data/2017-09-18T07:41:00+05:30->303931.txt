Chandigarh: A newly-hired servant drugged four members of a family in Sector 44, stole Rs 40,000, clothes and a car, ran into the cops during his escape but managed to give them the slip too in a series of events occurring within 12 hours.

 Somnath Sharma, 89, a former Citco general manager, had recruited Vinay as a servant on September 10. On the night of September 12, Vinay, who hails from Kullu in Himachal Pradesh, served Sharma, his wife, son and sister-in-law food laced with sedatives around 10pm. All of them fell unconscious. When Sharma’s driver came around 5am to pick him up for his Yoga classes, Vinay told him that he would not be going today. He then stole the goods and drove away in Sharma’s car. A few hours later around 10am, police officials landed up at Sharma’s door with Vinay by their side. Cops told Sharma that they had caught Vinay after he had hit his car into another vehicle. But as the effects of the intoxicant were yet to wear out, Sharma failed to make sense of the situation. Police took Vinay with them, asking Sharma to come to the Sector 34 police station later.
 
 When Sharma reached the police station with his son and demanded to meet Vinay, it emerged that he had fled. Sources said he had fooled the cops by making them believe that as the car was in their custody, he would return in the evening.
 
 However, police claimed Vinay was released as there was no complaint in the accident case. Deepak Yadav, DSP (south) said the accused did not flee from police custody. Police released him because there was no complaint in the accident case, he said. It was only later that the police came to know that Vinay had carried out the theft.
 
 After searching for him for four days, the Sector 34 police registered a FIR against Vinay.
