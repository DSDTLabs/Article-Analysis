PANAJI: The state government told the high court of Bombay at Goa that it has floated tenders for digital taxi meters. Additional government advocate Purna Bhandari told the court the last date for opening expression of interest was February 6, and “thereafter, necessary steps will be taken and compliance/progress with regard to the earlier order will be placed on record”. 

 The matter came up before the division bench of justices   and   Sardessai. After directing the transport department to implement   for taxis, the court has been monitoring the progress made by the government.
 
  The matter will be next heard four weeks later. The state was compelled to act on implementing taxi meters after the   (TTAG) and others dragged it to court for dilly-dallying in making them compulsory. tnn
