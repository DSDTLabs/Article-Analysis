Nagpur: BJP stalwart Lal Krishna   on Saturday called on RSS top leaders and had a brief interaction with them during his special visit to the city to attend the Vijayadashami rally. Advani’s visit to the Sangh headquarters after a gap of four years had triggered speculation that he was on some sort of political mission.

 Advani is believed to have reached the Smriti Mandir minutes before the rally started at 7.40am. Sarsanghachalak Mohan Bhagwat, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyyaji Joshi were present at the meeting. Soon after the meeting, they left separately for the rally venue in separate vehicles.
 
 Advani who landed here Friday night was putting up at Wardhaman Nagar residence of VHP patron Chandrakant Thakkar. Prominent RSS functionaries were among those who received him at the airport but as it was around 10pm already, the meeting was rescheduled and happened on Saturday around 7am, reliable sources said.
 
 The meeting assumes importance amid voices of dissent against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government, particularly the column written by party leader and former finance minister Yeshwant Sinha who targeted the failures on economic front and rapidly sinking country’s growth. 
 
 Minutes later, significantly, the RSS chief did voice his concern over high public expectations and Modi’s failure to deliver likely because of poor implementation of policies.
 
 As is now the norm, the RSS spokesman Manmohan Vaidya flatly denied that any separate meeting took place between Advani and RSS top leaders.
