MUMBAI: Directorate of Revenue Intelligence   12.5 kg   worth Rs 3.6 crore from a   resident, Muzaffar Pawaskar, on Monday night. 

 The gold, declared as machine parts, was being couriered from London through a private   company, officials said. Pawaskar, who allowed his Import Export Code (IEC) to be used for the imports, has been picked up by DRI. IEC is mandatory for carrying out imports and exports. 
 
 Officials said that they had specific information about the gold being smuggled through courier. They suspect that the gold was procured from Dubai. “If its shipped from London, it is unlikely to create any suspicion. The customs courier cell does random checking,’’ an official said. Officials are investigating the brain behind the operation.
