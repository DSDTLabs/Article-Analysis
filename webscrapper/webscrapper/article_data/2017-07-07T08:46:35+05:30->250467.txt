VARANASI: The   working on   has threatened to go on   from Saturday. 

 As many as 431   working since 2001, are given a   of Rs 4,200. The new 698 employees, who joined in 2006, are paid Rs 15,600 per month. "It is a gross injustice. Our only demand is to end this discrepancy by enhancing the salary of the old 431 employees," an employee said.
 
 General secretary of Uttar Pradesh Safai Karmachari Sangh Sonchandra Valmiki has been on hunger strike from June 26 over the issue. He was admitted to the hospital after his health condition deteriorated on Wednesday. He was discharged from hospital on Thursday after improvement in his health.
 
 "We have been agitating for last three months to get justice. But despite assurance given by urban development minister Suresh Khanna, nothing has been done so far," an employee Dilip Kumar Bharati, who also joined the hunger strike along with Sunita Devi, said. 
 
 Another office-bearer of the organisation Karan Das said that a delegation of sanitary staff had met the urban development minister on June 11. The minister had assured that the issue would be resolved within a week. But no government order has been issued so far. 
 
 The agitating employees have decided to stop the cleaning work from July 8. "We will meet the minister, who is expected to visit the city on July 8, to remind him of his promise," Bharti said.
