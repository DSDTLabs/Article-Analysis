 being located at the centre of the state serves as an ideal spot to host conventions to attract investments. But, the infrastructure available to host major conferences at present are limited as the city has got only facilities for indoor conventions. Besides inviting investments, the trade centre planned in   would in a way decongest the city that is starved of minimal space to host major events and road shows.

 "The city has got very limited space for conducting investor meets to highlight the potential and opportunities available in the region. The supposed SIDCO trade centre to be established at Panchapur can be utilised to promote events for boosting investments from South Asia," said M  , member,  . As of now, the organisers of any national or international conferences have to rent halls available in three star hotels in the city. Even then, the existing halls in the hotels struggle to accomodate the kind of crowd such events attract and limited parking space cause chaos on VOC Road, Royals Road, and Collector Office Road.
 
 Though the Trichy Corporation has got its own facility,   in WB Road, the congestion on the stretch is a big let-down for organisers to prefer the air-conditioned facility. Though the organisers prefer Trichy to host conferences and conventions because of the road and rail connectivity, the limited infrastructure puts Trichy below the other tier-II cities in the state where facilities were much better to conduct major conferences. As the hotels in the city limits are mostly in congested stretches, if the trade centre comes, a certain number of conferences would move to Panchapur, thus easing the traffic in Trichy.
