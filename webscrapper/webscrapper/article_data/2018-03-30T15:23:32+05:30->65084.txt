PUNE: Thirty-six black spots identified by the Pune police in a survey six months ago and sent to the Pune and   municipal corporations and the   continue to court danger. 

 An black spot is a place where traffic accidents have historically been concentrated. 
  
 
 Each of the 36 black spots was identified on the basis of the occurrence of three or more fatal and two serious   accidents in the last five years. The survey found several flaws in the road design and other factors. There has been no corrective action from the   to reduce accidents at any of these spots
 
 Police officers had suggested rectification measures to the Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad municipal corporations and the National Highways Authority of India. These included improving road infrastructure and installing road accessories to avert accidents.
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (traffic)   told TOI that of the 36 black spots, 16 are on the Katraj–Dehu road bypass. “In last six months, the traffic branch has written regularly to the different authorities to rectify these spots which will avert accidents and prevent road fatalities. However, nothing has been done so far,” he said.
 
 The problems highlighted were road banks, steep gradients, sharp turns, blind spots, and illegal speed breakers that have led to accidents. “At such spots, drivers tend to lose control over the vehicles easily causing the accidents,” he said.
 
 Similarly, the absence of road accessories such as signages, road markings, rumbling strips, and blinker signals also contribute to the accidents.
 
 “We studied the roads, especially the highways passing thorough the city and other arterial roads in the last six months and pointed out the regular accidents to the engineers from the civic bodies, state PWD and NHAI. Few suggestions have been considered and rectified but a majority of them still remain on paper,” he said.
