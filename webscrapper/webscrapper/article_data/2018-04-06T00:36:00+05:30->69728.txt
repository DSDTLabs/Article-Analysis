Trichy: The state-wide bandh called by DMK and other opposition parties on Thursday affected public life across the central districts as more than 90 per cent of shops downed their shutters in support of the dawn-to-dusk shutdown called by opposition parties to condemn the Union government for failing to constitute the Cauvery Management Board (CMB). 

 Around 500 TNSTC employees affiliated to DMK backed Labour Progressive Front (LPF) skipped duty. However, TNSTC sources claimed that government buses from Trichy to adjacent districts and Chennai were plying in full strength with the help of employees who accepted to perform additional duties. Despite this, the protesting transport corporation employees claimed that 10 per cent of government buses were grounded. Meanwhile, the operation of private fleets dropped by 30-40 per cent owing to minimal public movement in and out of the city citing the bandh. 
 
 “There are around 147 city buses and 153 mofussil private buses plying out of Trichy every day. Even though we were not participating in the protest, fearing backlash close to 30 per cent of private bus services to rural parts did not ply,” said D R Dharmarajan, secretary, Federation of Bus Operators Association of Tamil Nadu.
 
 Similarly, share auto rickshaws that usually ply from the central bus stand to Karumandapam and KK Nagar did not operate. As traders affiliated to various associations participated in the state-wide bandh, around 90 per cent of the shops in Trichy remained shut till Thursday evening. 
 
 To avoid any untoward incidents, police personnel were deployed across the six TNSTC and SETC depots in the city to ensure smooth movement of fleets.Similar protection was provided at Central government institutes. The ever busy Gandhi Market and NSB road had a deserted look owing to the protest.
