MUMBAI: The Bombay   has declined   at   in   relief from   of illegal structures there.

 A vacation bench of Justice Anil Menon and Justice Bharati Dangre on Monday heard a petition by 17 washermen seeking to restrain   from taking action on show-cause notices served to them between April 20 and May 2 for violating licences. 
 
 Their advocate argued that as part of their work of washing and drying clothes they had strung several drying lines, which the BMC wanted to pull down.
 
 The judges took note of a photograph which showed a washing stone at ground level with certain structures walled up around three sides. “In the background, there are at least three steel staircases supported by steel columns which can be easily noticed. These are pucca structures,” the bench said in its order. 
 
 The washermen’s advocate said the staircases were installed to access drying lines fixed at a higher level.
 
 The BMC advocate said the staircases accessed the ground-plus-one-level structures, atop which drying lines were fixed. She said the petitioners’ reside and also illegally cook there. She said the washermen had taken advantage of the washing stone licences to put up the illegal structures. 
 
 “In one of the photographs, we noticed the drying lines go across several AC sheets which appear to be the roof of some structure. It appears that there are structures which are covered that are put up and on top drying lines are installed,” the bench said.
 
 The BMC advocate said the petitioners would not be prohibited from carrying on their routine work. The bench said if the structures were built contrary to the licence conditions, “it is not possible for this court to grant any protection”. 
 
 Adjourning the case before the regular court in June, the judges said the BMC will be entitled to take steps in accordance with the law.
