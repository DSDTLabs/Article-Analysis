NEW DELHI:   on Tuesday vowed to intensify their protests after attempts to gherao the office of chief minister   were foiled by police. The workers, demanding immediate release of salary arrears, marched towards Kejriwal’s office from Rajghat but were stopped by police. 

 There were heated exchanges following which a woman, Shashi Bala, tried to immolate herself. However, police intervened in time. The protesters expressed disappointment over their failure to meet deputy CM   on the issue. “He did not meet us by design. The government is not serious about our issues,” said one protester. 
 
 “On February 10, we will organise a mega protest outside the deputy CM’s office at Mandawali,” said Sanjay Gehlot, president of MCD  , which is spearheading the protests. “We will not withdraw the agitation unless a permanent solution is found,” he added. The workers are demanding Rs 200 crore from Delhi government to clear their pending salaries.
