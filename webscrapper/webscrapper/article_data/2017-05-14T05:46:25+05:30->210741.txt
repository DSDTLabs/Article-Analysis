MUMBAI: In a relief for Apna Ghar Cooperative Housing Society at Versova, Andheri West, the   recently upheld its 2012 registration. The society , which has been allotted 23 acres of prime land in Versova, was mired in litigation for decades.

 The SC dismissed a special leave plea filed by the society's former chief promoter Ashok Kulkarni who had challenged its registration. Kulkarni and 11 others filed for its registration in May 2012. The registrar informed him the society was already registered in February 2012, on a plea made by its chief promoter. The registrar also rejected his plea to de-register Apna Ghar Society.
 
 The Bombay High Court too in 2013 refused Kulkarni's plea to de-register the society after holding there was “no misrepresentation" by the society, as he alleged. The HC observed Kulkarni was replaced by the society in 2011 as chief promoter. He then moved the SC that year. But last month after hearing a phalanx of senior counsel including Kapil Sibal, Sajan Poovaya, P P Rao, and P Chidambaram, the SC held, “We find no error in the view taken by the HC. The SLP is dismissed." The proposed Apna Ghar CHS formed in 1980, said a court document, at the behest of Kamlakar Walawalkar, then managing partner of Samartha Development Corporation, with Kulkarni as its chief promoter, had initially bought an around 86-acre plot in Oshiwara. The land was purchased in 1981from Oshiwara Land Development Company Private Limited. Of this the society eventually got 23 acres.
 
 However, in July, the SC will hear Kulkarni's other plea against grant of possession of the land to the society.
