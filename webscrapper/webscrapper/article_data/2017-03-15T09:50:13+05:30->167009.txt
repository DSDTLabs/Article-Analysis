VARANASI: The electors of eastern UP in 10 districts, who voted in the 6th and 7th phases of Assembly election, contributed significantly to the huge loss of   (SP), which had snatched power from BSP supremo Mayawati in 2012 with 224 seats. 

 After winning a substantial 40 seats out of a total of 61 in these districts in 2012, SP has been confined to 12 seats this time with a loss of 28 seats, while the BJP and its allies bagged 41 seats. Congress lost all the three seats won in 2012 while BSP managed to retain seven out of eight seats. 
 
 Adding insult to injury, this time SP even failed to open account in many districts, including Mau, Varanasi, Bhadohi, Mirzapur and Sonbhadra.
 
 At its worst, the Congress could not win even a single seat in 10 districts of Varanasi, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Azamgarh, Mau, Ballia, Ghazipur, Chandauli, Bhadohi and Sonbhadra. Even the road shows and public meetings of AICC vice-president Rahul Gandhi could not help the three Congress MLAs retain their seats, where they were uprooted by BJP candidates. 
 
 While Nadeem Javed from Jaunpur and Laliteshpati Tripathi from Marihan (Mirzapur) were runners up, Ajay Rai from Pindra (Varanasi), who had fought against Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha electionin 2014 but lost, finished third.
