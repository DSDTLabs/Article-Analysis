TV actor   is a huge fan of Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the Joker in the ' ' franchise. On the eve of the late   actor’s birthday recently, Karan paid a fitting tribute to his screen idol. 
He did a photoshoot dressed as the Joker and the look, attire and expressions were spot on. The actor, who is extremely happy with the outcome, says, “Heath’s twisted, manic take on the quintessential 'Batman' villain has resonated with me to such an extent that it made me root for the Joker instead of Batman in the film. This shoot was very impromptu. It was shot at the Versova creek, as I wanted the environment to help me build an eerie vibe. This is a small tribute from me to Heath on his birthday.”
