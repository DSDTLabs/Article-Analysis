Meanwhile,   Dr T G   has warned the villagers against conducting jallikattu in any place without proper permission from the district administration, failing which they would have to face criminal charges.

 A review meeting on the conduct of jallikattu was held in   on Friday. Vinay said that as per government orders, committees comprising the revenue, police and health departments had been constituted for the purpose of conducting jallikattu. They would monitor the entire process of the games and ensure that the animals do not experience any harm during the games.
 
 In addition, an audit committee comprising an agriculturist who is not a government employee, retired revenue staff, animal welfare board members and members of non-governmental organisations will visit the venues prior to the games and ensure that all arrangements are in place. If they notice any drawback, the organisers will have to rectify it.
 
  officials have to ensure the safety and stability of the galleries being established to enable spectators to view the games. Only the prescribed number of people should be allowed to occupy the galleries.   will be allowed into the arena only after veterinary doctors check them and the animals should be maintained in proper places before and after the games. Fire service and the ambulances should be kept ready in the venue.
