NEW DELHI: A 16-year-old girl in Shakarpur was allegedly abducted and gang-raped by two youths who claimed to be policemen. The girl said that after raping her on Saturday, the youths again tried to drag her into a car while she was returning from tuitions on Monday. But she raised an alarm and her neighbours caught them.

 In her complaint, the girl said the youths, who were later found to be residents of the same colony, told her on Saturday that the police had found her “objectionable” photographs and wanted to question her. After forcing her to board their vehicle, they took her to a nearby house and locked her up. Later, they raped the girl on the pretext of frisking her. She was let off but was threatened that they would publish her photographs on a social networking site if she confided in anybody.
 
 On Monday afternoon, the youths again started harassing her. The girl managed to alert a few neighbours who caught hold of one of the youths and thrashed him. The police reached the spot and arrested the youth. He has been hospitalised. The other youth was arrested later. They are 22 and 25 years old. An FIR under sections of gang rape has been registered and the police are looking for a third suspect. 
 
 The girl claimed that she didn’t know any of the youths. 
 
 The police said they had found a vehicle allegedly used in the crime. They are also trying to find out if these youths had assaulted any other girl in the area as well.
