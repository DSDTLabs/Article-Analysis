AHMEDABAD: A traffic police constable was allegedly thrashed in public by a   and his friend near Diamond police chowky in Bapunagar on Saturday. Both the accused are absconding. 

 According to the complaint lodged by  , 54, while he was maintaining traffic with head constable  , he stopped   who was driving on a wrong side from Diamond police chowky. 
 
 “Parmar, while verifying his driving license, read his name and address and asked him to pay the fine of Rs 100. To this Makwana reacted violently and pushed him on the ground,” said a Bapunagar police official.
 
 It was then that Makwana’s friend   rushed in. “Makwana and Rathod thrashed Parmar. They snatched Makwana’s driving license from Parmar and sped away on the scooter,” said the official.
 
 However, as there was no mention of what was head constable Phoolsinh doing at the time when Parmar was being beaten up in the FIR, cops are verifying his presence at the spot and whether he intervened or not to save his colleague from being publicly thrashed.
