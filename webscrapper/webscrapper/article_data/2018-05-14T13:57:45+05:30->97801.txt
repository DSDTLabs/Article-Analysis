VADODARA: M S University is likely to increase the fees of students living in the   from this academic year by around 10%.

 The proposal to increase fees at the Halls of Residence which covers 12 boys hostels and four girls hostel was mooted at the recently held meeting of hostel advisory committee. According to officials, students presently pay an annual fees of Rs 6,000 which is likely to increase to Rs 7,000. Also, the one-time deposit which is currently Rs 3,000 is expected to be raised to Rs 5,000. 
 
 The proposal has been passed by the advisory committee and will be now placed before the syndicate meeting next month for approval. 
 
 “The rationale for increasing hostel fees is to improve infrastructure at the Halls of Residence. There is a need to install CCTV cameras, tighten security and increase amenities for students on the hostel campus for which we require funds,” said a member of the hostel advisory committee. 
 
 The authorities have also proposed that instead of current system whereby a student is first granted provisional admission and later his or her admission is hostels is confirmed, there should be a system where students are directly granted permanent admission in the halls. 
 
 The committee has recommended that the university should urge the social welfare department of   government to provide priority to girl students of MSU in admissions at ‘samras’ hostel campus. 
 
 The samras hostel campus which has been constructed by the state government on MSU’s land at Tarabaug campus inside   premises can admit nearly 1,000 girl students. 
 
 But even as the university h ad donated its precious land for the project MSU students are not given priority when it comes to providing accommodation at this hostels. 
 
 Even last year, university’s syndicate members had asked registrar Neerja Jaiswal to write a request letter to the social welfare department of Gujarat government to give priority to MSU students and accommodate them at the hostels.
