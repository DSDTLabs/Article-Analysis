PANAJI: The ministry of youth affairs, government of India, has recognised Ramavtar Singh as the secretary general of the Volleyball Federation of India (VFI), providing a huge boost to vice-president Irvin Soares in Goa.
 
 Irvin is heading the   (GVA) for a long time but recent claims from former secretary Santosh Bandodkar suggested he was expelled by VFI president Avadesh Kumar. While Kumar’s stint as president has been challenged in the Delhi High Court, Irvin continues to enjoy support in Goa, most notably from the   and Sports Authority of Goa.
  
 At the annual general body meeting of the GOA, Irvin represented the GVA, while former secretary Bandodkar, although present, was not allowed to participate in any of the discussions.
  
 “Irvin was the GVA representative and since there was confusion over the secretary (new and old), we didn’t allow any of them to participate. Bandodkar was there but was not allowed to sign the register,” said GOA general secretary  .
  
 Bhakta also said it was sad to see infighting within the associations which hampered progress of the sport in Goa.
  
 “Even in basketball where there are two factions in the  , we want both of them to come together. Our president ( ) is taking the initiative,” said Bhakta.
