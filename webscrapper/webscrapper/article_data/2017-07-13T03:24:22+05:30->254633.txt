Mumbai: Action against the 281   under scanner for their alleged involvement in the   would be decided on a   and vary —from holding back promotion and increment to departmental inquiry—depending on their role, said senior civic officials. 

 On Wednesday, TOI had reported that an internal committee probing the scam had nailed 281 civic engineers from the roads department for failing to supervise road repair works. Of these, 90 were held responsible for the 34 shoddily repaired roads inspected in the first phase in Janaury 2016 and 191 have been accused of dereliction of duty for shoddy work on the 200-plus roads inspected in the second phase in May 2016. 
 
 A senior civic official said the BMC had decided to issue the showcause notices to all 281 civic engineers after monsoon sets in as they were required to complete the road works undertaken since October last year. 
 
 “The engineers who have been held responsible range from junior engineer level to deputy chief engineer who is expected to be on site and check that the contractor is undertaking the work as per the specifications. But the inquiry comittee found that these engineers have defaulted on their duty,” said a civic official. “Action would be decided on case-by-case basis. Depending upon their involvement, the action could either be holding back promotion or increment or a  .”
 
 The engineers’ union said it would await the showcause notices to see on what basis the engineers have been held responsible. Sainath Rajdhyaksha of the Brihan Mumbai Municipal Engineering Union said if “such a large number of engineers have been held responsible, it means there is some fault in the system itself”.
