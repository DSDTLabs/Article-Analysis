LUCKNOW: The   government will not bring an ordinance on triple talaq, said Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Thursday. 

 The government is in favour of discussion on the bill banning instant triple talaq in the coming Budget Session, added Naqvi while replying to a question on the sidelines of development coordination meeting in Lucknow on Thursday. 
 
 The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill seeks to outlaw talaq-e-biddat or instant triple talaq and punish offenders with a jail term.
 
 The triple talaq bill was passed by the   through voice vote in the Winter Session of Parliament but it could not scrape through the   with the opposition demanding that it be sent to a select committee for scrutiny.
 
 Replying to opposition's criticism on scrapping of Haj subsidy, Naqvi said that instead of doing any good the subsidy was actually bringing bad name to the Muslim community and moreover, the subsidy amount was very less now.
 
 The subsidy amount would be utilised for the uplift of Muslim community, especially girls, he added. 
 
 To a question on Shia Waqf Board chairman  's statement on madrassas being breeding grounds of terrorists, Naqvi said that the remark has not been made by Prime Minister   or chief minister   and what anyone else is saying has no significance.
