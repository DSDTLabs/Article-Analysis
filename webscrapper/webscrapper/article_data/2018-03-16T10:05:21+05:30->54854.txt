CHENNAI: Refuting charges the Tamil Film   Council has levelled against digital service providers (DSPs), city-based   Cinema Technologies co-founder Senthil Kumar has extended an olive branch, offering new discount rates under the VPF structure. “In the interest of cinema lovers and the film industry, the   has to be called off. We want to solve the issue at the earliest,” he said.

 Bringing in e-cinema providers to theatres when the need is to move to DCI standard will lead to losses as alternative platforms don’t offer sufficient security nor the quality as DCI, said Kumar. “They are free to opt for e-cinema from other providers to showcase content but it comes with a risk. There is a possibility of increased show losses if the service provider is not able to fix any technical failures within a 20 minute period. We are not saying that we can guarantee 100% uptime, but our ability to fix any issues is 99.97%.”
 
 Opposing the discounts offered, producer G Dhananjayan wants charges to be uniform for e-cinema and DCI. “In Hollywood, they levy one charge per screen. Why can’t they follow the similar pattern here? As it is, the Tamil industry is going downhill. Our fight is not just with DSPs, we have issues with distributors. This is a correction period for cinema,” he said.
 
 Kumar said their 350 support staff across the southern states, were positioned minutes from theatres to fix any issues quickly, day or night. Pointing out that the council seemed unwilling to discuss anything despite multiple solutions offered, Kumar said they had run out of ideas. He also wondered how producers were willing to pay VPFs to major multiplex chains when they released   in other states.
