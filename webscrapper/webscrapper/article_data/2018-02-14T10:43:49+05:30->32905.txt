PANAJI: Following assurance by   that it would not resume work on the Kalasa canal at  , Goa withdrew its interlocutory application before the   water disputes tribunal.

 Following WRD minister Vinod Palyekar’s visit to the   site, Goa government had filed an application before the tribunal seeking directions against Karnataka for resuming work on the Kalsa nulla diversion project.
 
 Taking cognisance of TOI’s January 12, front page report highlighting work carried out by Karnataka at Kankumbi, the WRD minister had rushed to the site that very day along with a team of department officials to verify the resumption of work.
 
 Karnataka secretary of water resource department, in replies filed, refuted objections raised by Goa and maintained that Karnataka has not violated undertaking given to the apex court as no construction work had been undertaken on the Kalasa project.
 
 During Tuesday’s hearing, counsel for Karnataka gave assurance that work on the Kalasa project would not be resumed till the tribunal finalised the matter. Karnataka also stated that it has not transferred any water from the Mhadei basin to the Malaprabha basin and has no intention to doing so until the matter is decided by the tribunal. The hearing on the main petition will be continue.
