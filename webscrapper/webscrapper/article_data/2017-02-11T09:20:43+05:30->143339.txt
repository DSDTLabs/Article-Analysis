MUMBAI: A passenger on an   flight to Chandigarh opened the aircraft’s overwing emergency exit before take-off at Mumbai on Friday. The action led to the rapid inflation and deployment of an evacuation slide and left a co-passenger injured, reports V Narayan.

 After IndiGo filed an FIR against Juhu resident   (31), a film editor, he was arrested for endangering the lives of passengers. “Mohan has worked on promotional videos of films. He seemed to be mentally disturbed when he committed the offence. It’s likely his brother was taking him to their hometown for treatment,” said a police officer.
 
 Mohan has been booked under the relevant law (IPC Section 336; the maximum punishment is imprisonment for a term of up to three months or fine of up to Rs 250) and under section 23(1)(b) (assault and other acts endangering safety or jeopardizing good order and discipline) of the Aircraft Rules, 1937, which calls for prosecution. Mohan will be produced before the Andheri Metropolitan Magistrate’s Court on Saturday.
 
 The incident occurred after the passengers had boarded IndiGo flight 6E 4134, which was scheduled for departure at 11.40am. “The A320 aircraft was being pushed back from parking bay 88 when the passenger, for reasons unknown, opened the emergency exit,” said an airport source.
 
 IndiGo, in a statement, said, “A co-passenger seated on 12A received bruises. The Indigo staff on board alerted the commander. Taking a precautionary measure, the captain immediately informed the ground staff of the situation on board and instructed the team to arrange for medical assistance and other necessary action. The captain also informed all 176 passengers on board via inflight announcement and switched off the aircraft engine.”
 
 Senior inspector   of the Airport police confirmed the incident.
