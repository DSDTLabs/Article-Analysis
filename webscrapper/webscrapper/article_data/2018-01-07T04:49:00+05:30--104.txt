Ahmedabad: A controversial notice that caught eye of various readers visiting MJ Library, was finally withdrawn on Saturday, after civic authorities intervened in the matter. TOI reported on Thursday that a notice stating – ‘All the readers entering MJ Library may please take note that readers wearing short clothes will not be allowed to enter the premises’ – had been put up outside MJ Library. Later, Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials intervened and ordered removal of the notice with immediate effect.

 Pankaj Chauhan, chairman – school board, AMC, said, “AMC does not intend to carry out any moral policing on people’s right to dress. There was no such intention even when the notice had been put up. As soon as it was brought to our notice, we have immediately taken corrective measures and withdrawn the notice.” When asked for reasons behind putting up the notice, librarian Bipin Modi said, “The notice had been there for a while now and it had been put up because readers – particularly students – visited in shorts and it was indecent. However, it has been withdrawn now.” tnn
