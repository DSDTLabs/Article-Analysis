After defeating   gold medalist   (Spain) before a cheering home crowd,   lifted her maiden   title on Sunday evening. Though it’s a sweet revenge for the Hyderabad girl, who had lost the Olympic gold to Carolina, she’s not one to rest on her laurels. Her mind is already on her next move; her next kill — Malaysia Superseries. On her way to Malaysia, shortly after her win, the badminton ace opened up to us about victory, defeat, ‘rival’   and more...

 
 
 Not at all. I have already defeated her at the recent Dubai World Superseries. Honestly, I don’t allow a victory or loss to burden me. Once a game is over, my mind automatically shifts to the next one. But of course, avenging the Olympic loss feels great. And I am very, very happy about my performance. It’s extra special because, this is my first Super Series title in 2017. Now, I want to continue this winning streak. 
 
 
 
 Yes, I’m definitely confident, but my focus will be on one match at a time. I’m off to Malaysia for the next superseries. Then there’s Singapore Open. right now my goal is to just keep up the momentum. Hopefully, I will continue to do well.
 
 
 
 Saina is a great player and an amazing fighter. There is no awkwardness at all with her. But yes, I’m glad that I won the tournament.
 
 
 
 My good luck charm is always proper planning with my coach. That works best for me, as far as charms go. 
 
 
 I am happy and thankful for what I have achieved. It does feel nice to know that youngsters look up to me as a role model. People often come up to me and say, ‘My child wants to pursue badminton. How should we go about it?’ I always tell them that the only thing that matters is hard work. Also, parental support is of utmost importance. My parents have played a huge role in motivating me. 
 
 
 (Laughs) Honestly, I want to see myself playing the role of PV Sindhu.
