They were promised permanent employment but taken on contract and later replaced by outsiders by many of these companies.” 
 
 It was decided at a meeting held at Hazira Kantha Mandli headquarters which was attended by 12 sarpanches and taluka and district panchayat members on Sunday that a rally will be taken out and a memorandum submitted to the district collector. 
 
 “We will be going to the district collectorate from Mora in more than 500 vehicles and press for acceptance of our demands. Over 10,000 people are expected to take part in the rally. We will give a call for bandh, rasta roko and observe hunger strike if our demands are not met,” Patel said. 
 
 Thakore Patel, member of district panchayat, said, “Black dust from industries has become a health hazard for locals. Our land has become barren and many people could be suffering from cancer. There are at least 1,500 youths in our area who are qualified but unemployed. Why can’t these companies give them employment?”
