KOLKATA: A 200-strong mob vandalised  , one of the city's leading  , on Wednesday morning after the death of a 16-year-old girl, a resident of the neighbouring Ekbalpore locality. 

 Doctors, patients and hospital staff fled in terror as the mayhem continued for over an hour before police arrived to take control of the situation. Some hospital staffers and security guards were injured and are undergoing treatment at the hospital.
 
 The hospital, however, did not file a police complaint, wary of stoking further trouble. Local leaders stepped in later to mediate an uneasy truce but doctors and paramedics say it will only last till another patient from the neighbourhood expires in the hospital. 
 
 While the patient's relatives claimed negligence by doctors, hospital officials denied the charge. What TOI gathered after visiting the spot and speaking to both parties was a communication gap. 
 
 The violence began around 9.30 am, nearly seven hours after class XI student   died in the ICU after doctors were unable to carry out an emergency operation as her condition deteriorated.
 
 Over the next hour, the ground floor was vandalised by the mob comprising local youths. The reception and billing sections were completely ransacked. Glass panels, telephones, computers and furniture were smashed to bits. It was only an hour later that a large police contingent arrived from Alipore, Ekbalpore and   and attempted to control the situation.
