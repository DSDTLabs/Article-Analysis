What was supposed to be the final project for his course at New York Film Academy has now become a much-talked-about short that is creating buzz online. Young filmmaker  , who happens to be Sandalwood superstar Sudeep’s nephew, has released his short film,  , online. The film stars   and   in lead roles. 
“This was supposed to be my final project. I never intended to release it online. All I wanted to do was to come back and make my film in India because I wanted to give them a glimpse of a different side by making a film in   — the language that I know — with subtitles. I worked on this film last June-July,” says Sanchith. The film deals with an encounter between a mother and her daughter, who she had given up for adoption years ago. “This is an awkward topic that not many have touched upon. The fact that these women are related so closely, have so much to talk about and catch up on, but find that hard, was what intrigued me,” says Sanchith, who adds that he has already received a lot of feedback from the industry, with many lauding his aesthetic sense.
 “I’ve also realized the potential and power of the internet and plan on releasing at least one piece of work every month online. My next project is a music video, which deals with the different kinds of losses one goes through,” reveals Sanchith.
