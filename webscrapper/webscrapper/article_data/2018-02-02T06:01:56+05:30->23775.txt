KOLKATA: The Calcutta high court on Thursday directed the police not to arrest the 29 senior executives who were with Floatel’s executive director   when he reportedly fell off a launchon January 20.

 The breather, however, is only till the next hearing — scheduled after two months. The HC, till then, asked the employees to cooperate with the investigators.
 
 The 29   officials had moved HC seeking anticipatory bail, claiming they were being harassed by the police. State consulSaswatagopal   opposed the plea and said: “The victim hasn’t been traced. The probe is still on and any anticipatory bail order now can influence probe.” The division bench of justices   and Rajarshi Bharadwaj turned down the anticipatory bail plea, but insulated the petitioners from arrest for the next two months.
 
 Bose, 42, who went missing on January 20 is yet to be found. His wife Aditi had, in a complaint to police, pleaded it should be probed if any foul play led to the incident. The cops had lodged a murder case. The employees and the launch’s pilot were questioned.
 
 Appearing for the employees, lawyers Sourav Chatterjee and   told the HC that their clients told the police they were playing antakshariwhen “Sir” (Bose) stepped out with his cellphone in his hand. That was the last anyone saw him.
