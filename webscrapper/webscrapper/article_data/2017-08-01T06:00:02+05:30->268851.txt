LUCKNOW/NEW DELHI:   president   made it clear that becoming a   MP did not mean giving up his organisational responsibilities as he was working wholeheartedly to strengthen the party at all levels.

 “There is no question of doing so. I have the responsibility of being the party president. I am happy, and I am working wholeheartedly,” Shah told the media in Lucknow where he is taking stock of the new BJP government and organisation.
 
 The comments seem intended to make it clear that he will continue to pay attention to the organisation and speculation of his joining the government are off the mark. 
 
 His three-year term as party chief ends on August 9 and he is expected to be elected to another three-year term. The BJP constitution bars any individual from serving more than two consecutive terms.
 
 Shah has been engaged in a country-wide tour to review the BJP organisation in what is seen to be part of an exercise to prepare well in advance of the 2019 polls. 
 
 A ministerial assignment would also be a violation of BJP’s one man-one post rule.
 
 Shah said BJP will return to office with enhanced numbers in 2019 polls. “BJP will emerge victorious with bigger strength than 2014 on the basis of development and good governance of the   government, as well as the 13 state governments of BJP in the country,” he said.
