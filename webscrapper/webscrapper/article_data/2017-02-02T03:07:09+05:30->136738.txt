 (FPIs) are exempt from tax on indirect transfers with retrospective effect from financial year 2011-12. This proposal will be a huge relief to FPIs who were taken aback with a circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) last December, which had included FPIs within the ambit of such tax. 

 Subsequently, on January 17, CBDT had held this circular in abeyance.
 
 "The CBDT circular had given jitters to foreign portfolio investors investing in offshore funds. The clarification that the investors in offshore funds registered as FPI - Category I (sovereign wealth funds) and Category II (broad based and regulated funds) will not be subject to indirect transfer provisions will allay their concerns. However, not extending this benefit to Category III (which includes foreign endowment funds and pension funds) is unfortunate," says Shefali Goradia, partner, BMR Advisors. 
 
 "The   has also promised that he will issue a clarification that tax on indirect transfers will not be payable if units of a fund are redeemed pursuant to sale of its Indian investments. To illustrate, global shareholders hold units in an offshore fund, which has invested in Indian shares. If such shares are sold by the fund and the units of the fund are then redeemed, there will be no indirect transfer tax implications for global shareholders." This should offer additional respite and make Indian stocks more buoyant.
 
 I n 2012, the I-T Act was amended retrospectively from April 1, 1962, to provide for taxation in India of transactions of transfer of shares or interest in a foreign entity which, in turn, derived its value substantially from Ind- ian assets. It is in this context that tax demands (now running above Rs 14,000 crore) were raised on Vodafone over indirect acquisition of assets in Indian market .
