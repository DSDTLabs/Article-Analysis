Ludhiana: The 108 employees employed through outsourcing in the Suvidha Centres of four zones with the MC in Ludhiana are working without salary for the past 4 months. Though the MC has finalised the contractor who will provide manpower to MC, the salary is pending due to some technical reasons which will be sorted out in a day or so. 

 The   employees met the MC Commissioner on Wednesday for a solution. However the civic officials have raised the concerns if MC did not solve this issue the staff can either go on strike and all services being provided to public might get affected. 
 
 The Suvidha centre employees have been hired through a private contractor and every three years MC had floated the tenders to hire a new contractor. However the tender has been allotted to the previous contractor but it has created gap of almost three months to the ending of contract and new allotment. The employees however are demanding their pending salary from the department. 
 
 MC commissioner Jaskiran Singh however assured them of a solution to the issue as soon as possible. Singh said that around three months back the contract had got expired and they had extended the time limit for hiring a new contractor. He said the previous contractor got the project and they would issue him the work orders. He said that as far as the salary is concerned there was some technical issue which will be sorted out soon.
