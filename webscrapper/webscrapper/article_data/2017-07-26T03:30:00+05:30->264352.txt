Mapusa: Mapusa taxi operators association have demanded exemption from the installation of speed governors. The association has also resolved to agitate if their demand is not considered by the transport department. The association of yellow-and-black taxi operators said that, in the past, none of their taxis was involved in accidents. The 53-member Mapusa taxi operators association have submitted a memorandum to the transport department requesting them to exempt Mapusa taxi operators from fitting of speed-limiting devices on their vehicles. Association president Vithal Mandrekar addressed the gathering and appealed to all taxi owners to stand united on the issue because fitting of the speed-limiting device will be an additional burden on them with installation costs. Mandrekar said that the association had already brought to the notice of the government that since 2015- 2017, around 587 people have died in accidents and around 925 people were injured. But, none of the yellow-and-black taxis were involved in any accident in the last two-and-half years. “This clearly shows that yellow-and-black taxi operators are driving their taxis with utmost care and abide by traffic rules and norms,” Mandrekar said. Legal advisor of the association, Mahesh Rane, said that the government needs to study the actual cause behind the accidents and by just having speed limits, it will not solve the problem. Secretary of the association, Suresh Amenkar, said that in Goa most of the roads are single lane and driving at the speed limit of 40 kmph will not ensure that customers will reach on time to their destinations.
