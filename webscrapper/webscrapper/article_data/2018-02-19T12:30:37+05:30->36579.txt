 Marilyn Manson, who was marking his return to the stage after four months due to an onstage injury, had to end his show due to meltdown.

 Reportedly, Manson resumed his   tour on Thursday, performing  ,   and 'This is the new s**t" before things began to go south. He started telling the crowd to show him more love if they wanted to hear more songs.
 
  
  
 He then threw his microphone, performed with his back to the crowd and pushed over an amplifier. He eventually walked offstage after claiming the fans didn't love him.
 
 Things got even more chaotic afterward, with the audience members tossing plastic cups and yelling out angry phrases. Manson came back and started mindlessly jamming before leaving the stage. It caused the crowd to chant, 'Refund'.
 
 Manson kicked off the 'Heaven Upside Down' tour in October last year, but was forced to cancel dates after a gun-shaped prop fell on him.
