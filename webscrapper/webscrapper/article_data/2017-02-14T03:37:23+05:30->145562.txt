NEW DELHI: The   on Monday stayed proceedings before the Madurai bench of Madras high court, which had issued notice to ex-SC judge   on a   asking him to return an award given to him by   ( ) in 2015. 

 After brief arguments from senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, a bench of Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justice N V Ramana issued notice to the PIL petitioner before the HC, 62-year-old agriculturist  , and stayed the proceedings before the HC.
 
 At the height of the projallikattu agitation in Tamil Nadu, Chakrapani had petitioned the HC alleging that since Justice Radhakrishnan had authored the ban on use of bulls in jallikattu in May 2014 on petitions by the Animal Welfare Board of India, PETA and others, the ex-SC judge had committed constitutional impropriety by receiving PETA’s ‘Man of the Year’ award in 2015. The HC had issued notice to the exjudge on January 31.
 
 Chakrapani had alleged that by receiving the award for a judgment, the ex-judge had violated the constitutional provision which bars judges from receiving any favour from anyone for any judgement and had requested the HC to direct Justice Radhakrishnan to return the award.
 
 Justice Radhakrishnan has rushed to the SC citing Section 3 of Judges Protection Act, 1985, which says, “No court shall entertain or continue any civil or criminal proceeding against any person who is or was a judge for any act, thing or word committed, done or spoken by him when, or in the course of, acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official or judicial duty or function.”
 
 Referring to the additional constitutional protection given to judges, Justice Radhakrishnan said the HC had irrationally drawn the proceedings without proper application of mind to provisions of the Constitution and Judges Protection Act.
