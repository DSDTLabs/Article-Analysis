NEW DELHI:  's   has become the first cricketer to be penalised for not obeying one of the many recent changes implemented by the ICC, the one that no longer allows ' ' antics on the field. During a the   â€“ a domestic limited-overs tournament in Australia, Labuschagne, in order to stop a single, put in a dive and attempted to throw the ball back while even though he did not have possession of it.

 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 The MCC's new Law 41.5 states that "It is unfair for any fielder willfully to attempt, by word or action, to distract, deceive or obstruct either batsman after the striker has received the ball."
 
 Once Labuschagne tried to trick the batsman with his fake throw, he immediately apologised to the umpire. But it was too late as his shenanigans were quickly identified and as a result, the opposition was awarded five penalty runs by one of the on-field umpires.
 
 The penalty runs allowed   to put up 279/7, which was successfully chases down by Queensland, with Labuschagne leading from the front and top-scoring with a 62-ball 61. He was also named Player of the Tournament.
