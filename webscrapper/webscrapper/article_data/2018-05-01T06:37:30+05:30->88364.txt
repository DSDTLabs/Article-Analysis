HYDERABAD: Over three lakh state government employees belonging to various employees' unions are gearing up to go on a strike from May 10 in pursuance of their demands. A   (JAC) consisting of 142 unions of gazetted, non-gazetted, teachers and workers unions gave a representation last month to the state government on 18 major demands and gave it time till April 30 to comply with them. Since the state did not respond to the demands till Monday, they have threatened to go on a strike from May 10. 

 If the strike happens, it will adversely impact distribution of passbooks and cheque books to farmers under   scheme in state which is slated to begin on May 10.
 
 "Our JAC Maha Sabha, comprising 204 departments from 31 districts, had unanimously passed resolutions on March 28 on various demands including abolition of the Central Pension Scheme and restoration of old pensions schemes after September 2004; bringing back of all   employees from AP, cancellation of order to serve and request for permanent allocation; lifting the ban on transfer and starting general transfers for employees; and implementation of the new Pay Revision Commission with effect from July this year," TNGO's president and chairman of JAC K Ravinder   told TOI. 
 
 "Our JAC will meet in the first week of May and decide the future course of action to take forward our demands including a strike. The agitations will be taken up in a phased manner," Reddy said.
 
 The JAC is also demanding that retirement age be increased from existing 58 to 60. "Many issues pertaining to employees remain unresolved for years. These include implementation of health scheme, unified service rules, reducing the three-year minimum service to two years for promotions and sanction of DA dues," another JAC leader said.
