NAGPUR: Making most of his advantage with the white pieces   posted a facile victory in the sixth round of the XIX Sant Marti International Open chess tournament at Badalona,  , on Wednesday.

 City's lone International Master (IM) continued his positional play to get the better of the lower-ranked Dougas Chavarria   of Spain and garnered full point in his third tournament of the  . With three rounds remaining, the 50-year-old has kept the city flag flying high collecting four points. 
 
 In his 32nd board battle the 55th seed Deshmukh started with his favourite English opening move while the 19-year-old Nestor opted for the Kings Indian defence. Till the 14th move the position remained at par for both the players. After exchanging couple of pieces Deshmukh became a pawn up and stretched his advantage to finish of the game in the 47th move.
 
 Deshmukh was expecting an easy finish against a lower ranked opponent but was surprised by the initial resistance of the young Spaniard. "I thought things will be easy against a lower rated player but he played very good and at some point had a better position too," Deshmukh told TOI from Spain. 
 
 "I played my normal English opening and after 10 moves we reached symmetrical position. In the 14th move he made a mistake by moving his b6 to a wrong position. This gave me control of the B file and I went on to dominate the play till the 33rd move," Deshmukh added.
 
 "His 27th move of Ne7 was punished by a punch from my h4 which helped me gain an extra pawn on the King side. Later, I finish the game by minor tactics of converting one advantage into another and exchanging my pieces at every juncture. Slowly my pawn became unstoppable from becoming a queen and young Nestor resigned in the 47th move," Deshmukh said while explaining the game. 
 
 In the 7th round Deshmukh will face a tricky opponent on the 13th board. With the black pieces he will square up against 15-year-old and higher seeded Indian IM Iniyan P.
