INDORE: Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has decided to reduce the proposed width of the road between Musakhedi to Ring Road,   for its road widening project. 

 The civic body had proposed to widen this 1 km road up to 50ft. Now, they decided to widen it up to 40ft only. 
 
 The decision was apparently taken after MLA Mahendra Hardia intervened in the matter as this road widening project was affecting structures of BJP workers. 
 
 The issue had also irked locals who were protesting against civic body when they came to know about Hardia’s intervention in this matter. They even raised objection against IMC demanding relaxation for them as well. 
 
 Around 15 commercial structures and 20 residential structures were there between Musakhedi Square and road leading towards Ring Road via Khati Mohalla. 
 
 This is for the first time, when the civic body has announced to compromise with the width of the road. 
 
 Civic body officials however said that a decision has been taken up in public interest. 
 
 “The new width of this road will be 40ft as it will save construction of most of the residents of the area,” said Shantilal Yadav, a zonal officer with IMC. 
 
 He added that also there is no other plans of civic body at this particular stretch so there will not be any issue if the width is reduced by 10 ft.
