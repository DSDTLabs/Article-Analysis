Nagpur: The Central Institute for Mining and Fuel Research (CIMFR) has discovered   in two areas in the Gondwana basin in Central India and Godavari basin.

 The total shale gas discovered so far in the country in these two basins is estimated to be about 63 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF). It is considered as one of the best sources of non-conventional natural gas.
 
 Vinod Mendhe, scientist from CIMFR in Dhanbad, told TOI that shale gas is methane gas or natural gas that is trapped within shale formations. Shales are fine-grained sedimentary rocks that can be rich sources of petroleum and natural gas. The shale gas beds occur 400-3,000 meters below the earth surface in a stretch of about 200-600m thick beds in coal belts.
 
 In 2006, CIMFR and ONGC had first carried out a project of shale gas exploration using a borehole reservoir technique. But in 2013, the coal ministry funded the project costing Rs22 crore. The new discovered reservoirs are now being explored using a consortium approach in which institutions like National Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad, and Coal India Limited will carry out characterization and potential studies of the Gondwana and Damodar basins.
 
 “The project report for launch of commercial exploration is expected to be submitted by May this year,” said Mendhe.
 
 The project will cover Raniganj basin in West Bengal, the easternmost depository of Damodar valley and the Barmer basin in Rajasthan as well as Wardha valley, Godavari valley, Mahanadi and IB valley in Odisha.
 
 Shale gas, which has about 95% of methane and 2% ethane gases, can be used practically everywhere where natural gas is used. It occurs in the fractured areas of sedimentary rocks speared from east to west and in central Indian regions.
 
 Mendhe said developed countries, especially the US, have started mining shale gas in large scale. In fact, shale gas is rewriting the story of natural energy resources all over the world.
