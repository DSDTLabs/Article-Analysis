BHUBANESWAR: Teachers' associations in the state opposed engagement of around 40,000 contractual teachers in   duty in the ensuing panchayat polls. They said engaging teachers without conditions of service is illegal and violation of human rights and demanded regularisation of their  . They also alleged that administrative officers are threatening the teachers of arresting them if they don't cooperate in the elections. 

 Those in election duty are vulnerable to crime and accidents during elections. "Those teachers without conditions of service will not get any ex gratia or compensation in case of accidents. If the government is not regularising their jobs then it has no rights to play with the lives of these teachers," said convener of State Teachers' Federation of Odisha Prakash Chandra Mohanty.
 
 Teachers have staged protests against their engagement in election duty at several places in the state like Bargarh, Sambalpur, Baripada, Jajpur and Puri.
 
 Despite repeated demands and agitations, the state government is not regularising the jobs of 40,000 block grant teachers nor do they get any facilities like dearness allowance, death or accidental benefits. "We had earlier announced that if the government will not fulfil our longstanding demands we will boycott the elections. Now they are giving threats of arresting the teachers if they don't do the election duty," said  , another teacher.
