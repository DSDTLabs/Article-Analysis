Singer-actress   says her boyfriend   is shocked by how fast she can run.

  
 "The other day,   was across the lawn, and I brought him something, and then I ran away... And he said, 'You run like you're 25 years old.' I haven't stopped that pace, so I'm still at that pace, I guess. When things start aching more, it'll be different," she told a magazine.
 
 According to reports, Lopez, who has 10-year-old twins Max and Emme with her ex-husband  , understands that eventually time will catch up with her.
 
 "Listen, at some point, I'm going to age. They'll say, 'She looks old!' But, right now, I'm holding it together. I just take it day by day, because it's so much stuff, and I try not to worry about too much," she said.
