Last seen as the level-headed Maha in  ,   says she has a much stronger character in director Merlapaka Gandhi’s  . “My character Subbalakshmi, or Subbu, as she’s called in the film, is a bold girl who has a mind of her own and is very strong. She is definitely crucial to the story and I loved playing the role,” says the actress with a smile. 
Touted to be a mixed-genre film that “starts out as a rom-com and morphs into a thriller”, Krishnarjuna Yuddham features   in a dual role. “The chemistry between my character and Nani’s is 
 really cute, I don’t know how else to explain it,” says Anupama, before adding that it’s different from the run-of-the-mill love tracks in romantic films.
 “It’s definitely unlike other love tracks. When you enjoy working with someone as much as I enjoyed working with an actor as fantastic as Nani, the chemistry on-screen works out beautifully too,” she says.
 Nani, who was listening in, chips in light-heartedly, “More than the chemistry between our characters,   has more of it with the camera.”
 “It was so much fun watching her work as she looks so simple off-screen while giving a shot, but when you watch her scene on the monitor, it somehow looks better. There’s just something about the camera and her, she really plays it to the tee,” the actor explains.
 Apart from Anupama, Nani will also be seen romancing Rukshar Mir in the film. “Rukshar was really good and she made a conscious effort to get her Telugu diction right. It made our jobs easier and helped us emote better. I think that kind of dedication for a first-timer is awesome,” he says. 
 But what about the chemistry between Subbu and Arjun, we prod, and Nani reveals, “While it worked out well to be honest, for most of our scenes, Subbu is so busy hating Arjun that I really don’t know how much of chemistry we really must have had. Of course, by the end of it all, they sorted it out. But initially, she didn’t like him at all,” he signs off.
