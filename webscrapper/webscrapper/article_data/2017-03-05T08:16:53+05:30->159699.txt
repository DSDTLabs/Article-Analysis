RANCHI: At a time when ‘Zootopia’ bagged the   for animated feature film in Los Angeles in the US last Sunday, students and faculty at BIT Mesra back home in Ranchi rejoiced too. For the first time, an alumnus from the prestigious engineering school was holding the award of merit. 

 Rajesh Sharma, who has been associated with Walt Disney Animation studios since 1998, earned his degree in computer science from BIT Mesra in 1989. Presently technology manager of Looks, Dynamics, Effects and Interaction Design at the Studio, Sharma played a key role in developing tools for giving effects to the film.
 
 Though he went on to collect a master’s degree in computer science from   and an MBA degree from UCLA’s   of business, BITians take extra pride in sharing the rare achievement of their senior, saying it was BIT which shaped his career. “We are proud of his achievement because he earned his initial knowledge in computer engineering here,” Aditya, an incumbent student of computer science in the institute, said.
