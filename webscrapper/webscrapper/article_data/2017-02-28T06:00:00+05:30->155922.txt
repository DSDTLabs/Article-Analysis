KOLKATA: A   broke out on the second floor of a   in a   lane late on Monday night. Twenty-five   were rushed to the spot and they were trying to bring the blaze under control till midnight when reports last came in but fire brigade and police officers said no one was trapped inside.

 The building on Amartala Lane, just behind Burrabazar police station, housed several godowns and one residential unit, officials said. All the occupants either came running out of the building or were evacuated by neighbours within a few minutes of the fire breaking out around 10pm. 
 
 Preliminary reports indicated the fire was caused by a short circuit.
 
 The major worry for fire brigade personnel and cops was the congested nature of the locality. “Even though no one is trapped inside, we have our hands full just trying to ensure the fire does not spread to other buildings in the neighbourhood,” a fire brigade official said.
 
  “The locality is absolutely congested and we had a lot of trouble just getting to the building as the approaches were very narrow and chock-a-block with people, shops and parked carts and cars,” he added.
 
 A portion of   and Rabindra Sarani were closed to traffic to give fire tenders an easier route to the spot.
 
 People from neighbouring buildings came out on the street as fire fighters struggled to control the flames. Cops from several divisions were rushed to the site as fire brigade officials apprehended a stampede.
