BHOPAL: BJP MLA from Mahidpur, Bahadur Singh Chauhan, has alleged that farmers are being cheated by traders and paid less for their produce in mandis. He demanded in the   to initiate procurement of   from March 10 instead of March 28, as announced earlier.

 Raising the problems of farmers who had sown Rabi crop early, Chauhan said the fresh harvest has arrived in several mandis of Malwa region, but farmers are forced to sell their produce to traders and middlemen at a throwaway price, as the state is yet to initiate procurement of wheat. “The government has announced to start wheat procurement from March 28, but the produce has already reached mandis, as sowing was done a month earlier this Rabi season.
 
 As government procurement is yet to begin, the farmers are constrained to sell their produce at Rs 1,200 to 1,300 per quintal to the traders while the minimum procurement price set by the government is Rs 1,650 per quintal.”
 
 Chauhan demanded that the government should ensure timely procurement of wheat. Replying to the query, state food and civil supplies minister Omprakash Dhurve denied that the farmers are being paid less for their produce. He claimed that farmers are being paid Rs 1300 to Rs 1700 for a quintal, depending upon the quality of their produce. “Farmers are not being duped in the mandis. They are paid adequate price of their wheat in mandis, ranging from Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,700 per quintal. The date of procurement was fixed as March 28 so that wheat gets dried up before being taken to the mandis,” said Dhurve.
 
 He said for 2017-18, 10.67 lakh farmers have registered through e-procurement of wheat, which also included 1.53 lakh farmers from Ujjain. The government is gearing up for buying 100 lakh metric tonnes of wheat, he added.
