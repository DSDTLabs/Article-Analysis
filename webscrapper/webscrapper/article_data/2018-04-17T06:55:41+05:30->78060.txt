 It was the last week of December and 10-year-old Jaymini, my daughter, was all excited as she was on her way to   from Andul in Howrah in our new car. She had just popped her head out of the sunroof when an alloy-coated kite string cut through her throat. She had to be admitted to the ICU of a hospital off EM Bypass.
 
 My daughter had to spend five days in hospital. She was put on ventilation for four days. She has recovered now and is doing fine but justice has so far been denied to us. The Karaya police station had registered a case on January 8 (case number 15) under several IPC provisions, like 283 (danger or obstruction in public way or line of navigation), 287 (negligent conduct with respect to machinery), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant). But they have told us that the investigation is over and that they have not found anyone flying kites in the area on that day.
 
 Doctors told me that she had suffered a six-inch cut on her throat. Was it then due to some other reason? As a parent, I do not definitely think so. I am now mulling going to court challenging the findings of Karaya police. If there was no kite-flying, why and how did this biker get hurt? I had lodged a complaint against unknown boys who were flying kites from building terraces adjacent to Maa flyover because I was convinced that this had led to the accident when my family was on its way to Eco Park.
