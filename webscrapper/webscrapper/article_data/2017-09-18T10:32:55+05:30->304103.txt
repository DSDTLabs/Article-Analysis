CHENNAI: Cricket fans in Chennai were a touch disappointed not to see their local hero   celebrate his 31st birthday at his home as he isn’t part of the India-Australia first ODI at   on Sunday.

 However, the ace spinner, who is in UK featuring in county cricket, didn’t disappoint one of his biggest fans in the city - P Venkatesan, who is battling for his life with a kidney-related ailment. In a heart-warming gesture, Ashwin ensured Venkatesan watched the India-Australia ODI at the venue by providing him a hospitality box ticket.
 
 Venkatesan, who will be undergoing a transplant surgery during November with his sister coming forward to donate a kidney, was a thrilled man. “I have only viewed from the galleries. Thanks to the efforts taken by Ashwin’s management team, I am watching the game from the hospitality box. For someone like me it’s a once-in-a-lifetime event. I will never ever forget the courtesy extended by Ashwin,” said 43-year-old Venkatesan.
 
 Ashwin, in a statement, said that it was part of their endeavor at The Ashwin Foundation to “put a smile” on faces. “We are definitely not doing this for publicity. It is the part of our endeavor at The Ashwin Foundation to put a smile on faces. Every request or friendly demand cannot be met with a positive response but we do the best we can. Venkat is a genuine cricket lover and this is the least we could do for him,” he said.
 
 Venkatesan, a regular at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, wanted to see Ashwin in action against Australia at Chepauk. But it didn’t happen. “I saw the Test match where he bowled beautifully. I wanted to see him in action on his birthday. A bit disappointed but no doubt but if India wins I will be fine,” said Venkat. 
 
 Far from the MAC, Ashwin still has made a mark at his home ground with this gesture.
