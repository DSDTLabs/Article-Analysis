BENGALURU: The energy department is considering reducing incentives to industries, that is if they are found consuming excess power or wasting it. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, energy minister   said in the backdrop of prolonged drought and excess power consumption, measures are being taken to increase energy efficiency and reduce burden on power generators. “One such measure we are considering is reducing incentives to industries, in case they are found drawing excess power,” he said.

 The government is also making it mandatory for farmers to use energy-efficient irrigation pump (IP) sets. “The IP sets need to be converted into energy-efficient models. We instructed all Escoms to make it mandatory for farmers to start using only those IP sets which draw less power,” the minister said.
