PANAJI: A Delhi-bound   plane, with 168 passengers on board, was forced to make an emergency landing at the   on Monday after the pilots detected a technical fault in the aircraft soon after take-off. The pilots immediately radioed the air traffic control (ATC) at the naval base at Dabolim, seeking priority landing due to the emergency.

 “After take-off, the pilots found a technical malfunction on board the aircraft and returned to the airport,” airport director Bhupesh Negi said.
 
 Airport sources said flight AI 155, was scheduled to take off at 2.10pm from Goa airport for Delhi, but due to air traffic congestion, it was delayed for nearly two hours and was finally cleared for take-off at around 4pm. 
 
 Around 10 minutes into take-off, during which the flight was gaining altitude and charting a course to Delhi, an alarm went off in the cockpit alerting the pilots to the malfunction, prompting the pilots to immediately alert the Navy at  . 
 
 Goa International Airport is a civilian enclave at INS Hansa, a naval base, and thus, ATC duties are handled by the Navy.
 
 The Airbus 320 was grounded once it returned to the airport. Air India has sent a team of engineers investigate the reason behind the fault, an official from the airline said. 
 
 Passengers, who requested to be accommodated on other airlines in order to meet prior commitments, were put on other flights by Air India. The other passengers, who opted to stay back, finally left for Delhi at 9pm after Air India pressed an additional aircraft from Mumbai into service.
 
 “It is normal to send out an immediate alert to all the regulatory authorities, including the director general of civil aviation (DGCA),” an   (AAI) official said.
 
 “We arranged for connecting flights for passengers who missed their earlier flights,” an Air India official said.
