MUMBAI: Low-cost carriers IndiGo and GoAir have eight and three Airbus 320neos respectively with one engine of the type that is highly susceptible to engine failure as deemed by the European aviation regulator, said the   on Tuesday. Airbus 320neo aircraft have two engines. 

 Last week, following an emergency directive by the European regulator about these   and Whitney (PW) engines that belong to a certain sub-category, Indigo grounded three A320neos. On these three aircraft, both the engines were of the said category red-flagged by the   (EASA). But   has allowed A320neos on which only one of the two engines belong to this faulty category to continue flight operations. 
 
  TOI had carried a report on Monday quoting Airbus that Indian carriers had 14 A320neos with either one or both the engines belonging to the said category. The report said it was not known how many of these belonged to Indigo and to GoAir till Tuesday when   provided the information. 
 
 Since these A320neos are now not allowed to fly on routes where the closest runway is more than 60 minutes away, the DGCA said no other additional operational restriction has been imposed on these aircraft. "DGCA continues to monitor operations of these aircraft," a DGCA official said.
