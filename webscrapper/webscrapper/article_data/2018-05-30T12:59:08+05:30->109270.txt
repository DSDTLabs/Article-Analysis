PUNE: With monsoon round the corner, the   has started the process of getting it buses repaired to ensure a hassle-free commute for its passengers. 

 The sudden realisation by the transport body, though, has not amused commuters and activists alike who claim that the repair works highlighted by the transport body are nothing but regular maintenance issues which should have been taken care of all round the year.
 
 “There are quite a few buses which don’t have proper window panes, several buses don’t have windscreen wipers, while some buses need roof repairs. We hope that the passengers will have no problems while travelling in the buses during the rainy season,” said   public relations officer  .
 
 “All aspects are being taken care of by depot managers. Before the monsoon sets in, all the buses will be repaired. The drivers are being told to be extra cautious while driving during the rains,” he said.
 
 “The repairs are a part of all-round general maintenance. How can buses have no window panes or have leaking roofs? What has stopped the PMPML from carrying out these works earlier? I am sure that commuters will have to face a lot of problems during the rainy season due to the ill maintained buses,”  , secretary of the  , said.
 
 “Almost all the buses have some or the other issue. The seats are not proper, the windows don’t have panes and there are holes in different parts of the buses. It is really amusing that the PMPML wants to make all its buses perfect with only days remaining for the monsoon to set in. And it is a pity that they didn’t think about it earlier and did not maintain their buses on a regular basis,” said Rashid Sheikh, a daily commuter.
