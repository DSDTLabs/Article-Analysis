MARGAO: The   villagers social and welfare forum (CVSWF) has expressed its opposition to the amendments carried out by the erstwhile   government in 2011 to the Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, 2010. 

 Addressing the media on Saturday, members of the forum said a PIL has been moved in the high court of Bombay at Goa to quash the “arbitrary” amendments made to the Act.
 
 The forum has also sought “for an appropriate writ or order striking down the illegal amendment carried out to the Goa Land Development and Building Construction Regulations, 2010, vide Notification No. 21/ 1/ TCP/ 2011/ Part File/3252 dated August 4, 2011.”
 
 The PIL also seeks a stay against the housing project of the Rahejas Universals Ltd, which has managed to “unjustly get technical clearance from the town and country planning department,  , and construction licence from the Carmona village panchayat”.
 
 “In 2008, the technical clearance given to the Rahejas was revoked as it contravened established legal provisions. And the village panchayat of Carmona has also unjustly granted NOC to the fresh technical clearance given to the Rahejas. It is now to be seen whether the present BJP government in Goa will conduct a   inquiry to book the fraudsters (in the then Congress government) for publishing the said fraudulent amendments that replaced the earlier group housing regulations which came in the way of granting technical clearances easily. Undoubtedly, these unreasonable amendments will only aim to destroy Goa contrary to its government-planned constructive all-round development,” said Wauswell Miranda, president of the forum.
