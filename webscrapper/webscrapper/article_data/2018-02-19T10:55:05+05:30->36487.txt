Five months after wetland rules were notified by the Centre, the state government has constituted a 21-member Maharashtra   Authority (MSWA) under the environment minister. The move comes after the Union ministry of environment, forest,   (MoEFCC) notified the Wetland (Conservation & Management) Rules, 2017, in September. The new rules have replaced rules formulated in 2010.

 Under the new rules, powers have been granted to the state government to protect and conserve wetlands. These rules call for setting up of a state wetland authority in every state and Union Territory to be headed by environment minister.
 
 
 Now, activities like conversion of wetland for non-wetland purposes, including encroachments, disposal of waste, construction activities and discharge of effluents from units will be prohibited.
 
 The experts include government officials, including Dr  , head of department (environment), YASHADA, Pune.
