MUMBAI:   has remained non-committal on honouring obligations against guarantees issued by its employees without authorisation in the   case. The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) has decided to take up the matter with the   (RBI), warning of a crisis if the issue was not resolved in a few days.

 
 On Saturday, top officials of lending institutions met to hammer out a solution to the impasse. Several banks were stuck with unpaid loans by Nirav Modi and   group companies after extending them buyer's credit based on PNB guarantees.
 
 At the meeting lenders tried to impress upon PNB that any transaction through the SWIFT messaging system had to be treated as bona fide. They tried to convince the PNB chief, who participated through video conferencing, that even instruments issued through connivance have to be honoured. However, there was no commitment from PNB to pay. In the absence of a breakthrough, the lenders, under the aegis of the IBA, decided to approach the RBI to intervene. The lending banks have refuted PNB's move to blame their overseas branches for not following norms while releasing funds. "The bar on providing 360-day credit applies to diamonds and precious stones. Here the imports were of cultured pearls so the bar on funding for 360 days does not apply," said a lender.
 
 According to lenders, there is no liquidity problem in the banking system. "Once they take a decision to pay, an arrangement can always be made as there is liquidity in the system and payment can be prioritised," said a lender. Although the letters of credit can be recalled, lenders are willing to wait until the date of maturity to get their money.
