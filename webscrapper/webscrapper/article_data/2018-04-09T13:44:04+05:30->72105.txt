PANAJI: Over 850 records in the   script have been transliterated at the state archives  . These comprise over 700 pages of correspondence between Goa and its neighbouring kingdoms. 

 Department sources said that some of these letters between Maratha rulers and the Portuguese governor general have revealed details about negotiations for peace. 
 
 The Modi script was commonly used in official Marathi documents by the   administration. Then, in the beginning of the 20th century, the British government of the Bombay presidency decided that the Devanagri script should be used as the primary writing system in administration. The decison was taken for the sake of convenience and uniformity with other areas of the presidency. 
 
 In April 2017, the state government had created a budgetary provision to transliterate the Modi script, following which six experts from the Pune-based   have been visiting the department premises in Mala, Panaji, over the past few months to decode the documents. The experts dedicate a week every month to carrying out this task. This activity paused due to the end of the financial year and will resume shortly. The department houses over 5,000 documents in the Modi script.
 
 “Summaries of the documents have been prepared in English to give a gist of the letters,” said archivist Balaji Shenoy. “Once all the documents are transliterated, people from all over the world will be able to refer to these records. We have to publish them so that people can use them for research and help scholars from the sociological point of view.”
