AGARTALA: Floods have rendered more than 23,000 people homeless across  , state disaster management officials said.  , Gomati and Khowai are the worst affected districts, and relief camps have been set up to shelter the displaced.

 
 Though the situation has slightly improved now with the water level of Howrah receding below the danger mark, water from the hills is still flowing downstream and inundating the plains on both sides of the river, officials said.
  
  
 
 
 
 West Tripura district magistrate Sandeep K Mahatma said the administration is monitoring the flood situation and providing relief materials to those affected. Food, drinking water and milk for children is being distributed in the camps while doctors have been stationed there to cater to any medical emergency.
  
  
 
 
 
 Many have been shifted to camps in Udaipur and Sonamura due to a sudden rise in Gomatiâ€™s water level on Sunday night. The water levels of Khowai, Dhalai, Manu and Deo are reportedly on the rise.
 
  
  
 
 
 Tripura government has issued a flood alert across the state and advised people to exercise caution after two people were killed in landslides triggered by floods on Sunday. This came after four people were similarly killed on Friday. At least 14 people have been killed in pre-monsoon showers and thunderstorms in the state this year, while at least 24 have been injured and more than 10,000 huts affected.
  
  
 
 
 
 With the national highway being inundated in several parts of Jirania division, the eastern entry to Agartala has been blocked. Railway services in the north have also been disrupted due to waterlogging in the tracks.
