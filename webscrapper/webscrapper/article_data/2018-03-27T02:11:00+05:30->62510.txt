Chennai: Annoyed with the continuing menace of unauthorised digital banners, even after numerous directions issued by the court, the Madras high court has ordered show cause notices to the chief secretary, the municipal secretary and the DGP as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them.

 A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice Hemalatha passed the order on the plea moved by R Fathima seeking action against officials for allowing illegal banners in Kumbakonam, Swamimalai, Papanasam, Kabisthalam, Thiruvaiyaaru, Nachiyaarkoil, Manapparai, Viralimalai and Othakadai.
 
 When the plea came up for hearing before the Madurai bench, the court drew the attention of the additional advocate-general to several orders passed by the court in connection with such illegal banners, and said, “Time and again, repeated PILs have been filed bringing to the knowledge of this court erection of illegal digital banners and the inaction on the part of district collectors concerned, the commissioners of corporations, the superintendents of police and station house officers, and for taking effective measures to prevent such illegal acts and to remove the illegally erected banners. And, as usual, some status reports used to be filed as to the action taken; but, in effect, no effective steps have been taken.” 
 
 Noting that the court had been left with no other option, the judges said they were inclined to issue notices to the secretaries and the DGP at the first instance to show-cause as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for having violated its orders.
