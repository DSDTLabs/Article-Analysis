MALAPPURAM: The   for   M B Faisal filed the nomination papers on Tuesday. Faisal, accompanied by minister   and CPM leaders   and P P  , filed the nomination papers before the district collector Amit Meena, who is the district election officer. 

 Earlier, Faisal visited the Elamkulam Mana, the ancestral home of the late EMS Namboothirppadu, and sought blessings from his family members. 
 
  CPM state secretary   dubbed the move of the UDF leaders to bring back   (M) led by K M Mani to the front as a move prompted by the fear of defeat in the byelection. He was speaking after inaugurating the election convention of the LDF at the town hall here on Tuesday.
 
 "If the Muslim League is confident about the victory in the byelection, their candidate Kunhalikutty should have resigned the MLA post before contesting in the byelection. The decision to contest the election without resigning MLA post is clear evidence of lack of confidence of the party," he said adding that the Muslim League and the BJP were the two sides of the same coin.
 
 Ruling out the allegations that the LDF had fielded a weak candidate in Malappuram, Kodiyeri reminded that a young leader K T Jaleel managed to trounce Kunhalikutty in   in 2006 and C P Muhammed was defeated by the young leader of CPI, Muhammed Muhsin in Pattambi in the last assembly elections. "We cannot rule out the possibility of a victory similar to that of Kuttippuram in Malappuram byelection this time," he said.
