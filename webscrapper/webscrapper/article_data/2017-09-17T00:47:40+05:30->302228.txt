Trichy: The percentage of high order birth category (HOB) couples in Trichy saw a mild decline in the district last year thanks to the coverage of eligible couples under contraceptive schemes. According to the health and family welfare department, the percentage of HOB in the district was 7.8 % in 2016, down from 8.2% in 2015. 

 In August, six of the 14 blocks in Trichy had 937 couples listed as HOB. Thuraiyur block topped the district with 362 couples while Marungapuri with 78 couples stood at the bottom of the list, according to the department. The number of HOB in Thathaingarpettai, Manapparai, Vaiyampatti and Thottiyam were 87, 86, 157 and 167 respectively. 
 
 Trichy recorded an approximate number of 3,200 live births a month. A total of 3,588 couples have two children each and the department had made efforts to sensitise them about contraceptive measures. Besides Thuraiyur, the number remained high in Manapparai and Vaiyampatti blocks. Deputy director of family welfare, Trichy, Dr Elizabeth Rani, said that lack of education and irregular employment were found to be the reasons for people not showing interest in birth control measures. “They depend on odd jobs and don’t want to lose their income by visiting the hospital for family planning surgeries. But we are educating them about the importance of birth control,” Dr Elizabeth said.
 
 Navalpattu block in Trichy had figured in the list of very high order of birth (HOB) women in Trichy. Department of public health and family welfare claimed that the continuous efforts of village health nurses (VHN) helped them bring down the rate thus pushing Navalpattu down in the list. For family planning surgeries, women between the age group of 18 and 45 years are targeted because of their reproductive prospects. Women above 35 years are advised contraceptive measures, either permanent or temporary, depending on the number of children they had.
