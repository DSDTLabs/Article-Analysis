Ghaziabad: In a departure from the traditional way of staging   in the city, this year it is loaded with high-end technology, including special effects, laser beams, hydraulic platforms and a massive LED screen that makes Ramlila a treat to watch. People in large numbers are getting attracted to watch the advanced tech set-up in the Ramlila ground in Kavi Nagar.

 Professionals from different fields have been rehearsing for months to present a unique take on Ramlila in front of the audience.
 
 Priya Gupta, who works in   is playing the role of Sita for the first time. “Ramlila has been told, re-told and enacted millions of times in the past so there is no novelty factor in the plot. We’re solely dependent on sheer performance of the actors. Though many believe that it is easy to enact but the fact is that it requires months of practice to get the mannerism and histrionics right,” said Priya.
 
 Yogesh Gupta, a 40-year-old lawyer, is doing the role of King Janak this year. “It is tough balancing professional life with rehearsals but my passion for acting keeps me going. The ultimate reward is when you are recognised for your role but that seldom happens,” said Yogesh.
 
 There are about fifty odd artists, all of whom are working professionals from different fields, but they have been bitten by acting bug and are reliving their passion by playing roles of different characters. Same number of technicians and back stage staffers have been working round the clock to present a different technology-laden Ramlila in front of the audience.
