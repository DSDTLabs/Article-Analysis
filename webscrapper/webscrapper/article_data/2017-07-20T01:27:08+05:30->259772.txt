NEW DELHI: While dismissing a man’s plea, a   has said that the   in favour of his wife — Rs 4,833 per month —was not on the higher side at all when considering the standard of living and consumer price index of a metropolitan city like Delhi. 

 “An amount of Rs 4,833 per month is essentially required for bare sustenance of the person residing in such a big city,” observed additional sessions judge ( )  .
 
 The man had challenged the maintenance order on the ground that he was earning a meagre amount while his wife was earning and was more educated than him. 
 
 The man claimed that his wife received lots of love and affection from him and his family members, but they only faced ridicule from the other end. He alleged that the woman wanted to live independently and not in a joint family. 
 
 The man was also allegedly abused by her family members when he tried to reconcile with her.
 
 The woman, on the other hand, had filed a domestic violence case against her husband. The man’s lawyer, however, said that the order — passed by a magistrate court — was not sustainable as the court had failed to note that his client was only a labourer making Rs 6,000 every month. 
 
 It was also argued that while he had studied only up to class 8 his wife had studied till class 10 and was earning through her embroidery work. 
 
 Though the woman’s lawyer contested the man’s claims saying the man was earning around Rs 45,000 a month, the magistrate court calculated the amount of maintenance on the basis of wages of unskilled workers in Delhi. 
 
 “Keeping in view aforesaid facts and circumstances, I do not find any illegality and infirmity in the order of the magistrate court. Therefore, the present appeal is dismissed,” the ASJ held.
