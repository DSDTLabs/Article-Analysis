LUCKNOW: Two days after UP government notified adding of 'Ramji' in  's name, his grandson,   on Friday said that he would move the court against the decision. 

 "We are taking a legal opinion and examining if a writ petition can be filed against the UP government's decision," Ambedkar told TOI. Himself a leader of Maharashtra-based Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh, Ambedkar said that the move was nothing less than 'Hinduising' of Babasaheb legacy. 
 
 He said that it was not a coincidence that the UP government came up with the idea at a time when the issue of Ram Mandir was picking up pace. "Babasaheb and his family were Kabir Panthis (followers of Kabir)," he said.
