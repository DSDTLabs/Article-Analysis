CHANDIGARH: The monthly house meeting of the municipal corporation became tense when former mayor   of the   ( ) questioned the motive of the tax branch behind sending the house-tax default notices to residents.

 The comment annoyed additional municipal commissioner  , who heads the tax branch. He stood up and said his team had collected more than double the usual property tax from the residential areas and still its intentions were being suspected. Later, the municipal commissioner and some councillors pacified the Garg and praised him for “a remarkable job by the tax branch in recovering the taxes that had stopped coming”. 
 
 The argument started when some of the councillors said the tax branch had sent out default notices to those who didn’t fall in the tax ambit—such as people from the EWS (economically weaker section) houses. Congress councilors   said EWS families even in his ward had received notices.
 
  MC commissioner Jitender Yadav said: “We admit that some of the notices have been sent wrongly and we will withdraw those, but since this entire exercise has been computerised for the first time, some mistakes are bound to happen.”
