After earning his acting stripes with films like 'Gangs of Wasseypur', 'Badlapur' and 'Manjhi -The Mountain Man',  , someone who proclaims to have two left feet, is venturing into freakishly unfamiliar territory with Sabbir Khan's Tiger Shroff-starrer ' '. The 42-year-old actor plays a wannabe dancer in the film. Now, Mirror has learnt that he is testing his vocal skills as he gears up to rap in Hindi for another upcoming film.

 Titled 'Humre Baap Ka Bitwa Bandookbaaz', the number, for the film 'Babumoshai Bandookbaaz', is written by   (also the editor and producer) and composed by music director Gaurav Dagaonkar. Expected to be a fun, peppy number, the song will also get a promotional video.
 
  
  
 Nawaz, who has wrapped up his portions in 'Munna Michael' and has begun shooting for  's 'Manto', will be filming the special video and recording the rap song for the upcoming film, an action-thriller directed by Kushan Nandy. The film follows small-time contract killer Babu, played by Nawaz, his friends and rivals, and what happens when he falls in love and takes up a tricky assignment.
 
 "I love trying new things!" Nawaz exclaims while speaking to Mirror. "I have never danced in my life, and now not only am I dancing but also rapping. When you get down to actually doing it, you realise it's not that difficult," he says, adding that he has no problems in remembering long dialogues, so is not worried about remembering the rhyming lyrics of the rap.
 
 "Once I remember a long part, especially if it is in continuation, it's easy to keep repeating it as it gets stuck in my head. That's why I don't forget my lines and also why I am not worried about rapping," Nawaz shares, adding, "The song is as quirky and funny as my character in the film, so it will be catchy. I think people will enjoy it."
