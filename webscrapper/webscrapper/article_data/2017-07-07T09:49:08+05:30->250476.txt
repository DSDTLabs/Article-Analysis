AMRITSAR: While the authorities in India are still struggling with the vexed problem of frequent damage to the country's tallest flag, installed at a height of 350 feet, at   due to strong winds, Pakistan has announced to hoist its national flag atop 400-foot flagpole at  . 

 According to media reports in Pakistan, the government has begun preparations for the project and started clearing the space by cutting down trees. If hoisted successfully, the flag would be the eighth tallest flag in the world.
 
 On March 5 this year, India had hoisted the national flag at Attari but it was torn by strong winds within a couple of days and had to be replaced. 
 
 The flag has been replaced five times ever since. In fact, the flagpole has been without the tricolour for the last three months. The Indian authorities had to face much embarrassment when the flag fell to the ground during daily beating the retreat ceremony on the India-Pakistan border.
 
 The country's tallest national flag, which was said to be seen from Lahore, had dampened the feelings of Pakistani audience at their viewers' gallery during the flag lowering ceremony.
 
 "There can be no other but psychological reason behind installing the tallest flag at Wagah. Pakistani authorities must have felt that with India installing the tallest flag, which was seen from Lahore, had lowered their prestige so they have taken such decision," said former deputy inspector general of Border Security Force D S Saran, while ruling out any possibility of a technical reason behind the decision of installing tallest Pakistani flag on the border with India.
