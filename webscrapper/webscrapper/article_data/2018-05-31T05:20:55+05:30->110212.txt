NAVI MUMBAI: Two weeks after a 70-year-old woman,  , was killed at her Navi Mumbai home, the police said that it was a "silly misunderstanding" that spurred her alleged killer to commit the crime. The police said that the key accused,   (27), had taken a peek of the woman's passbook which showed her account balance with 'cr' as the suffix. While Bansode mistook the balance to be in 'crore', the 'cr' was actually an abbreviation for credit. The woman's balance was mentioned in credit, meaning a positive balance. 

 Two of Bansode's accomplices-Atul Kamble (21) and   (33)-have also been arrested. Senior inspector Rajendra Galande said Bansode worked for an agency making Aadhar cards and PAN cards at an E-Seva Kendra in Turbhe. He met Hande when she visited for Aadhar card work. When she gave him her passbook as address proof, he saw 'cr' written near balance. "He thought the 'cr' stood for 'crore' and assumed woman has savings and plotted to kill her," said Galande. 
 
 Another officer said that on May 17, he and his aides went to her house. They smothered her and took 15 tolas of gold worth Rs 4.5 lakh and Rs 15,000.
