After breathing life into some of the strongest female characters in Indian cinema,   is excited about returning to comedy with Rohit Shetty’s out-and-out commercial film ' '. 

 Is she keen to break the perception that she only takes up intense roles? “I am glad there is a certain space people identify me with, but I don’t have any preferences, bias or prejudices against any kind of cinema. I take up whatever piques my interest. Besides, people offer me what they think I will be good at and what works for them,” she replies.
 
 Though her career boasts of an array of films in which the heroine takes centre stage, Tabu says that a film being female-centric shouldn’t be the only reason to take it up. The actress elaborates, “I have never categorised my films as female-centric. In fact, it never occurred to me that I should take up a project just because it centred around the heroine. It doesn’t make sense to be part of a female-centric film, if the character isn’t interesting.” 
 
 A lot of new-age actresses are balancing their careers by juggling both unconventional and big-ticket projects. Asserting that several factors govern her choice, Tabu says, “I am no one to comment on others as I wouldn’t know what governs their choice. My choice, my graph and my path in life, including my career, have always been driven by my personality and journey — internal and external.”
