PATNA: The question paper of   (SSC) examination on May 14 for appointment of multi-tasking staff, which went viral on the social media an hour before the examination, was procured from Haryana. 

 This was revealed by Manish Kumar, the alleged kingpin of the   gang who was arrested by the Patna police on Wednesday. “We cannot reveal the names of Manish’s accomplices in Haryana as of now, but we will soon get in touch with our Haryana counterparts and break the nexus,” Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj told TOI.
 
 Altogether eight men, including Manish, were arrested from Lohia Park area under the Patrakar Nagar police station area here on Wednesday in connection with the SSC question leak. Manish’s arrested gang members include Shambhu Prasad,  , Dilip Kumar, Manish Kumar (II),   Ranjan alias Pintu Singh, Sintu Kumar alias Ajay Kumar and Rakesh Ranjan. “The gang was involved in leakage of papers of different exams for the last two years,” said the SSP.
 
 According to the SSP, Manish told interrogators he made the SSC question paper available to around 100 candidates an hour before the examination on payment of Rs 4 lakh each. A postgrad in science, Manish and his accomplices were nabbed by a special team headed by ASP (operations)  . Several devices used for cheating were recovered from them. Maharaaj said they all belonged to lower middle-class families, but now owned luxury cars and flats here. “They also confessed to being part of a plot to leak  , which they had promised to certain aspirants to sell for Rs 12 lakh each,” he said.
