A surge in blood pressure (Hypertension) can may not produce any noticable symptoms in many. However, headaches, visual disturbances, dizziness, nasal bleeds, stroke or a heart attack may be a presenting symptom in a few.

  Single BP reading is more like a snapshot which gives you only a momentary value and is a poor guide for the response to therapy and its 24 hours control. Also, single high BP reading in an out-patient clinic cannot be an indication to start anti-hypertensive therapy. Though the reliability of medical personnel measuring BP using a manual device is high, it has its own practical limitation as far as long term and frequent BP monitoring is concerned. Hence, International guidelines recommend frequent home based Blood Pressure monitoring to ascertain BP control, to identify "white coat hypertension (nervous surge in blood pressure some people experience during a doctor's visit)". Tracking your blood pressure readings over time will help your doctor to take appropriate treatment decisions and will also reduce your risk of heart related event. 
 
 For home based monitoring of BP, an automatic, cuff-style, bicep (upper-arm) monitor is advisable. Wrist and finger monitors are not recommended for they harbor poorly reliable readings. Automatic monitors are easy to use and may even have the feature of sending the readings to your doctor via your smart phone.
 
  To make the home based readings more reliable and reproducible, follow the following steps:
 - Avoid smoking or drinking caffeinated beverages or exercise within 30 minutes of measuring your blood pressure.
 - Sit correctly with your arm supported on hand rest. 
 - Take multiple readings (preferably 1 minute apart) and record the results
 - When you make an appointment with your doctor, do take your BP monitor with you. The doctor will make sure it is properly calibrated and will teach you how to use it correctly. 
 
 If your BP readings are consistently high, do consult your healthcare professional to verify if there is a health concern or whether there may be any issues with your monitor.
