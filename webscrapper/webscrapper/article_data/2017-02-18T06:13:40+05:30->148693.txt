NEW DELHI: The   took strong exception on Friday to the Centre's alleged inaction in removing hazardous waste dumps created in many municipal areas across the country posing serious danger to citizens' health.

 “You are taking hazardous waste from other countries for monetary considerations and allowing it to be dumped in India. It is our own country and if citizens suffer consequences of such dumping, we will not keep quiet,“ said a bench of Chief Justice   and Justices N V Ramana, D Y Chandrachud and  .
 
 The court's concern coincided with the fire in Bengaluru's Bellandur lake, which was caused due to dumping of toxic waste.Though Bengaluru lake fire did not find any mention during the hearing, an NGO's counsel,  , told the four-judge bench that a high-powered committee had given a report three year ago suggesting removal of hazardous waste dumps that have mushroomed in many parts of the country . Chromium and arsenic waste dumps are posing serious health hazards to the citizens as it had the potential to contaminate groundwater, he said.
 
 Appearing for the Centre, senior advocate   said the government would file a comprehensive affidavit taking note of the concerns expressed by the petitioner. The bench said: “Affidavits will not do the job. Do not try to scuttle the issue by filing affidavits.What we need now is concrete steps on ground.“
 
 The SC asked the Centre to file the action taken report within four weeks.
 
 But the Centre's counsel sought more time saying it required collating data from across the country . The bench declined and said: “You (the Centre) will be in trouble if you do not file the affidavit in four weeks.“
