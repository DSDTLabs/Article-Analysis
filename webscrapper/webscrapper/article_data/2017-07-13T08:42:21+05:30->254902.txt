KOCHI: The   probing the possible conspiracy behind the actor rape and abduction is also looking into the financial and land dealings of  . Investigators suspect that personal grudge would not be the sole motive.

 SIT sources said that they are collecting the details of land dealings of the actor. “Dileep is financially sound and we don't expect this to be the cause behind the grudge which lasted for years. Vengeance on account of allegedly meddling in his personal life is considered as the primary motive. However, we will investigate the possibility of financial dealings leading to the crime,“ said a SIT member. The team is investigating whether there are dealings involving the actor, the survivor and another prominent actress.
 
 Financial dealings of the actor have come under the enforcement directorate lens. “We will look into the case as their investigation becomes productive.

The SIT in the remand report presented in court on Tuesday had said that the accused's personal grudge against the actress led to the crime.
