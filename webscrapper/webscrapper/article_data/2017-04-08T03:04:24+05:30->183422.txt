MUMBAI: Clarifying that his government has not ruled out loan waiver for farmers, chief minister   said every state takes a decision dependi-ng on the situation there. “Congress is demanding a loan waiver here, but in Karnataka, its gover-nment has refused it. In Punjab, Congress said it will approach the Centre on the issue,” he said. 

 Addressing a press conference at Vidhan Bhavan at the end of the budget session on Friday, Fadnavis said while the Congress-NCP government had given a loan waiver of Rs 60,000 crore, his government has given them a direct benefit of Rs 8,000 crore. The government’s efforts were focused on bringing 31 lakh farmers into the institutional credit system, he added but did not disclose how this would be done. 
 
  leader in the assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil alleged, “The condition of farmers in Maharashtra is worse than in  . Instead of emulating the UP government, we can suggest how to raise funds for loan waiver.” Dhananjay Munde, Opposition leader in the council, suggested, “The state could borrow money from BMC on interest to waive loans.”
 
 Accusing the Opposition of politicising the   issue, Fadnavis pointed out that 53,000 farmers had ended their lives during the 15-year regime of the erstwhile Congress-NCP government. “They started pursuing the loan waiver demand after their debacle in the recent local body elections,” he said in the council. The CM was replying to the issues of farmer suicide and low crop prices raised by Munde on Thursday.
