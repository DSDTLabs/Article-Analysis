KOLKATA: Rain seems to be following the Indian and Australian teams. Hours after the two teams were involved in a rain-truncated series-opening ODI match in Chennai on Sunday, heavy rains lashed Kolkata in the wee hours on Monday. The sun continued to play hide and seek with clouds throughout the day as the players of the two teams landed in a chartered flight to play the second ODI here on Thursday. The groundstaff at the Eden Gar dens had one eye on the sky and kept fingers crossed as clouds hovered above. With the entire outfield kept under cover, the pitch-preparation process was badly hampered.

 With the monsoon lingering longer than expected in this part of the country, the curators and groundstaff face a race against time to get the pitch and outfield ready before Thursday's game. The CAB needed special permission from the BCCI to test the pitch ahead of the match, following which the senior Bengal team had a practice session on strip No. 5 which has been earmarked for the ODI. The test result was encouraging, much to the relief of CAB officials.
 
 Intermittent showers also seem to have adversely affected ticket sales. The common man's preoccupation with the upcoming Durga Puja festivities - slated later this month - too has contributed to the poor response for tickets. But the good news is that the Regional Meteorological Centre has ruled out chances of rain on match day.
 
 The Eden track changed its character after the CAB altered the sand and clay ratio in the outfield before the World T20.
 
 But the good bounce and carry that now characterises Eden pitches is likely to be missing on Thursday.
