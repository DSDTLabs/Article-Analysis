NEW DELHI: A major fire broke out in three factories in outer   on Thursday less than a week after a fire in a Bawana   took the lives of 17 people. Though there were no casualties in this incident, items worth several lakhs were destroyed in the flames. 

 The fire broke out due to a short circuit. Police said that the owner, Jai Bhagwan Agarwal, was away from his factory, which manufactured foam, when the incident took place.
 
 Fire officials said that they received a call from the area about the fire around 9.30am, and 15 fire tenders were sent to the spot. When the fire could not be controlled in the next hour, 20 more fire tenders were sent. Police said two  , Manish and Ranbir, were   while putting out the blaze.
 
 Officials from the fire department said that the godown attached to the factory was stuffed with cotton and other inflammable materials, due to which the fire spread rapidly. The fire engulfed a scrap dealerâ€™s shop, a shoe godown and a foam manufacturing unit.
 
 People present in the factory during the incident were evacuated in time.
