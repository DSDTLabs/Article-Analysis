DHARAMSHALA: With no government assistance, a primary school in remote village of   district in Shahpur area has got helping hands from abroad. The primary school was opened at Niharki, about 60 km from here, in April 2014. However, nothing was done ever since — there is no building or other facilities for students in the school. 

 After social activists shared posts of students toiling hard to study, some residents of Texas in USA responded by sending stationery material for the children here, Niharki villager Karnik Padha told TOI. The school does not have a building of its own. Sources said some disputes have led to delay in construction of the building. 
 
 The villager, who had been demanding a primary school since 2007, donated land for the school in 2010. However, the notification was issued only in April 2014. As of now, the school is being run from a rented room and most students are forced to study in the open. 
 
 “It cost almost Rs 10,000 to bring the material (donated) to the village. We have other donors from Mumbai too. They have sent schoolbags, water bottles and other stationary material for the kids,” Pradha added.
 
 Meanwhile NGO ‘Prayas se Parivartan Tak’ has been actively involved in helping the students for close to two years. “We are encouraging them to study as it is not possible for the people of this village to send their kids to distant places for primary classes,” said Rahul Kumar, a local member of the NGO.
 
 The school has 29 students with 14 girls and 15 boys. Students from nearby villages of Basot, Gajhrala and   also attend this school. “Kids from the age of 5 to 10 years can’t be sent to far-off places. There are other government schools here but that are about four to five KMs and transportation facilities are not up to the mark to help them reach school safely. Keeping these factors in mind, the land was allotted to build a school,” said  , one of the senior members of the school management committee.
