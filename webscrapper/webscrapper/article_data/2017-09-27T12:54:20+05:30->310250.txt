COIMBATORE: All  ,524 village panchayats in   will get high-speed broadband internet connectivity under the   project phase 2 within a year, said the secretary of department of telecom, Government of India, Aruna  , here on Monday.

 She was reviewing the BharatNet implementation in Tamil Nadu under Digital India scheme. Apart from high-speed internet, the state is also planning to provide cable TV services to all village panchayats. 
 
 “With internet penetration in rural and remote areas, it is expected to boost the economic growth of these villages — in terms of employment opportunities and other economic activities,” Sundararajan said. 
 
 She said, “There are 26,700 local cable operators (LCOs) who are interested in providing internet access to rural areas. They can build and maintain optical fibre network. The project envisages 100Mbps (megabytes per second) to 1Gbps (gigabytes per second) broadband internet to all village panchayats and each household will be benefited by high-speed broadband internet.” 
 
 Tamil Nadu Arasu Cable TV Corporation (TACTV) will act as the nodal agency for the implementation of the project, Aruna Sundararajan said.
 
 Currently all district headquarters are provided with 1Gbps internet connectivity and it will be enhanced to 2Gbps very soon, she said. There is huge scope for internet of things (IOT), innovative technology, and M2M (machine to machine), and Tamil Nadu has immense potential in rolling out new projects which will also generate new jobs for the rural youth, she added. The review meeting was held at BSNL Bhawan, Coimbatore. Officials from TN government, BSNL, TACTV and various stakeholders attended the meeting.
