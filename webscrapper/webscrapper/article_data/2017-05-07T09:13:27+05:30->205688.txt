 “Heat tolerance is affected by body size. Children being smaller and weighing less, but compared to  , their ability to tolerate stress of   or cold is affected an also, they build up more heat than adults,” explained Dr Sunil Verma, a city based physician.
 
 Pediatricians said children take longer to acclimatise to change in hot and cold weather. “An adult will get accustomed to heat wave in about a week to 10 days but a child’s body will take 10 to 14 days. Adults may cope well with heat or cold, children may not have the same tolerance,” reads an article on International Journal of Sports Medicine.
 
 Physician Dr D P Mishra said children and adults should both safeguard against sudden change of temperature which happens when a person comes out an air-conditioned atmosphere into normal weather and vice-versa. “Maintaining body’s fluid balance is an essential defence. Taking precautions like wearing caps and glasses when returning from school are useful,” he stated.
