PUNE: A 45-year-old woman lost over Rs 29,000 to   cloning even though she never used the card after it was issued to her this March. 

 The police suspect that the   may be linked with the alleged theft of data of 32 lakh credit/debit cards hacked by cyber fraudsters from various banks.
 
 Housewife Vijaya Ghone from Bibvewadi received a new credit card from the bank on March 29 but she never used the card for shopping and nor did she share any of the card’s details with any other person or tele-callers. On April 4, Vijaya received text alerts relating to six online transactions done using her card. She promptly blocked the card and approached the   cell to file a complaint after she refused to pay the card bill to the bank. 
 
 Bibvewadi police inspector Santosh Barge on Wednesday said, “This is a case of card cloning as the complainant has claimed that she never used the card, but fraudsters may have used the card details for making online purchases.” 
 
 “The cell authorities after conducting preliminary inquiry referred the case to the Bibvewadi police station. We have registered an FIR under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act,” Barge added. 
 
 Vijaya’s husband Dnyaneshwar Ghone told TOI, “My wife received the delivery of the credit card, but the bank has not given her the PIN number till date. We don’t know how the transactions were done using her card. We have filed a complaint with the bank and the police and they should carry out investigations to ascertain how the fraud took place.”
 
 The cyber crime cell had recently arrested three Nigerian nationals for using cloned credit and debit cards at isolated ATMs in the city. The suspects’ have been remanded in custody till July 20.
