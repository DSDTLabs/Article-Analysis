Patiala: PSEB Engineers’ Association has opposed the proposal of Punjab State Power Corporation limited (PSPCL) to retire state-owned   at Bathinda and Ropar.

 President of the association Sanjeev Sood said that the association has written a letter to the cabinet sub-committee to examine the PSPCL’s proposal. It has further demanded a white paper from the government explaining the basis for closing the units and financial benefits thereafter.
 
 General secretary Ajaypal Singh Atwal said that the association in the past has warned of the consequences of lopsided generation policies and total reliance on private sector but unfortunately policymakers did not pay any heed, and as a result the consumers today are paying more for power.
 
 The present installed capacity of Punjab is about 14,000 MW. Out of this, state sector thermal generation is 2,640 MW.
