BENGALURU: It is almost official now. The proposed   will be yellow, white and red, with the state’s   — Gandaberunda — at its centre.

 After TOI first reported about the nine-member committee having submitted a favourable report recommending a   for the state’s official symbol (Feb 6), senior officials privy to the developments said the flag will have the Gandaberunda (a two-headed mythological bird) in the centre. 
 
 “The colours yellow and red would have been ideal, but since   raised objections, that could not be considered. The committee has recommended three colours, with white in the middle along with yellow and red,” a senior official said. The panel felt white, symbolizing peace, captures Karnataka’s image the best, along with the other two colours that have become synonymous with   identity.
 
 Chief minister Siddaramaiah told reporters on Tuesday that he has received the report and it would be placed before the cabinet in the next meeting. “The report has been sent to the Kannada and culture department, which has been tasked with preparing a cabinet note. The CM has asked the department to place it in the next meeting, which is likely to be held on February 14 or 15,” the official added.
 
 Another official said the government — after cabinet approval — will write to the ministry of home affairs ( ) seeking an amendment to the Flag Code 2002. “The government will seek an amendment to enable provisions of including the   flag as one of the symbols in the Flag Code,” the official said.
 
 If the Centre gives its nod to the said amendment, Karnataka will be the second state in the country to have its own flag after Jammu and Kashmir, which is allowed the same under Article 370 of the Constitution.
 
 An MHA official from Delhi said while there is no provision allowing or disallowing such a flag, there has been no precedent. “The issue will be seriously examined by the (Union) government.”
