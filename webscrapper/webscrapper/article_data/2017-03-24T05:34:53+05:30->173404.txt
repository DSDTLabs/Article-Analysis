PATNA: Over 200 architecture students of Birla Institute of Technology-Patna staged a   on Thursday, alleging that the degree offered by the institute is not accepted by other universities as their course is not approved with the   (CoA).

 The protestors claimed that students face an uncertain future as they wait to get registered with the CoA, a statutory body of government of India, under the Architect Act 1974, after completing a five-year bachelor of architecture course (a mandatory requirement for those who want to practice as architect).
 
 The students shouted slogans against the college administration and alleged that they have been cheated because they are not able to get a job as the degree is not recognized. 
 
 A final year architectural student said he cannot apply for further education anywhere as he is not eligible to practice as architect. “We had no clue that this course is not approved. On its official website, the institute clearly mentions that their degree is recognised by CoA,” said the student.
 
 Another student who was protesting at the campus said he got to know about non-recognition of the course from   officials. “When we got admission here, we were told we would get a UGC approved valid degree. However, we got to know a month back that the institute is not recognised by UGC,” he added.
 
 Because of the unrest, which continued for around two hours, the institute authorities suspended all the classes for the day to avoid any untoward incident.
 
 Later in the evening, the students had a meeting with the institute director S P Lal. During the meeting, Lal assured the students that the administration is trying its best to get the course recognised by CoA. Clearing the air on uncertainties, Lal said, “We have applied and the council has not denied to give the affiliation. We are sure that we will get the affiliation.”
