GHAZIABAD:   worth nearly Rs 50 lakh was seized in Indirapuram on Tuesday while the consignment was being transported from Delhi to UP, billed as soybean.

 The consignment, being transported in a truck, contained 842 cartons of liquor bottles bearing brand names such as Signature, Royal Challenge and McDowell’s. Police said samples of the seized alcohol would be sent to a forensic science laboratory to check if it is spurious. The truck, bearing a Rajasthan registration number, has also been seized while its driver   (50) and his assistant   (42) have been arrested.
 
 Vikramjeet and Jagraj are believed to have told police during questioning that they had picked up the sample from a carrier in Ambala in Punjab. They told a news conference on Tuesday that at least on two occasions earlier, they had transported such consignments from   to Kanpur, where consumption of spurious liquor had resulted in at least 12 deaths between May 19 and 21.
 
 “We had picked up the consignment from Ambala. The person who had handed it over to us had given us a mobile phone too. We were being constantly guided over the phone on the route to take,” said Vikramjeet Singh.
 
 “Most of the bottles had labels of ‘meant for sale in Haryana only’ but did not carry price tags on them. We are sending the samples for analysis to check if the bottles contained spurious liquor,” said Indirapuram circle officer Ravi Kumar.
