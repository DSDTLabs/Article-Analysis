The government has been wooing   to set up a factory on its soil, but billionaire   isn’t falling for it. At least not yet.

 
 In a tweet, the CEO of the electric-vehicle maker said a restrictive policy environment in the South Asian country is proving to be a hurdle for local production. Earlier this month, the Palo Alto, California-based company moved a step closer to establishing a factory in China, which would be its first production facility outside US shores, as the Asian giant eases rules for carmakers such as Tesla. “Would love to be in India,” Musk said in the Twitter posting. “Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately,” he wrote, adding Tesla will enter the country as soon as CFO  , who is from India, believes it’s time.
 
 Despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s assertions that “more than 1,400 archaic laws that were an obstacle to doing business have been abolished”, Asia’s third-largest economy isn’t the top pick for many foreign investors. Musk said last year that Tesla was in discussions with the government, requesting temporary waiver of import penalties and other restrictions until a local facility is built.
 
 India’s tax structure, which has kept Tesla away, is changing rapidly to facilitate shift to environmentfriendly cars, transport minister   said in January. Modi had set a goal for all newly sold cars to be electric models by 2030, a target seen as too ambitious by carmakers because of poor infrastructure and limited manufacturing capabilities.
