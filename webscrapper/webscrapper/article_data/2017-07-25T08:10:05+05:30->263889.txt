HYDERABAD: A   restriction on over-the-counter sale of acid notwithstanding, almost every second kirana shop and supermarkets in the city has been selling acid in plastic and glass bottles as toilet cleaner. Police says such acids have been used to attack women often by jilted lovers. 

 In 2013, the apex court had instructed governments to issue acid-sale licences to select retailers. The outlet which are authorised to sell acid, it was mandatory for them to keep a record of the buyers. Only after the buyer provided address proof and a photo identity card, they will be handed over the acid, so they can be traced in case of any incident. 
 
 "The shopkeepers do not ask for any such details. They don't even note down address or any details. Acid is easily available in any other shops in the city," said M Ramanna, a customer who was buying a bottle of acid. Few days back, a 22-year-old woman factory worker was attacked with acid by a colleague in Pet Basheerabad, said to have used a usual acid, which is easily available in any shop. 
 
 "We suspect that the acid was not a high quality one, it was the usual acid which is used as toilet cleaner and available easily in the market," said DCP crime Janaki Sharmila. 
 
 Drug Control Administration (DCA) officials say even the usual acid available in market can be hazardous. "The yellowish acid available in the super markets and kirana shops can be very harmful. It is usually used after diluting with water while cleaning toilets. However, the raw product can be very dangerous and can be easily misused," said  , joint director of DCA. The state government had put out a draft law, soon after the judgement, to regulate sale of acids in the state under Poisons Possession and Sale Rules 2014. 
 
 However, for past four years, there is no implementation of the   order.
