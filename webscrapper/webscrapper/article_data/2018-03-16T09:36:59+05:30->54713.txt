MUMBAI: The BCCI’s decision to withhold Mohammed Shami’s central contract until all accusations levied by the India bowler’s wife   are thoroughly investigated wasn’t a unanimous one. The final decision was taken only once the   ( ) heard the audio tape in which Hasin is heard accusing Shami of meeting a woman named Alishba in Dubai and taking money from her.

 
 
 
 
 Until a couple of days ago, the CoA and certain state association members were not in favour of withholding Shami’s central contract. TOI has learned that a cricketer-turned-administrator vehemently argued against the withholding of Shami’s contract at the captains and coaches conclave held two days ago. A senior BCCI employee supported this decision.
 
 
 
 “Less than 30 cricketers from a pool of hundreds are privileged to earn an India contract. In such a small group, if there’s a cricketer who is being accused by his wife of adultery and there are other serious allegations, what message is the BCCI sending to society in general,” sources in the know of developments said. “If not for the fixing allegations made by his wife, the opposition would’ve continued. The board was almost on the verge of a huge blunder.”
 
 Now, with the cricketer out of contract, there are more questions surrounding his future. As one of India’s frontline pacers, will Shami be allowed to use the facilities at the National Cricket Academy or his state association in order to work on his fitness, knowing that India will be travelling to England immediately after the IPL? Will he be allowed to participate in the IPL or even in domestic tournaments pending investigations?
 
 “We’re taking about a very important India cricketer, so whatever is done in this regard, BCCI needs to ensure that he’s not lost to mere allegations or biases of investigations reveal he was set up,” said sources.
