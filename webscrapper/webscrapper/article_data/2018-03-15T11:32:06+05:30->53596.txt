BHOPAL: This is one for ‘believe it or not’. Madhya Pradesh has a whopping 2,000 people over 100 years old and 20,000 in their nineties. At least that’s what the state pension data says.

 The government itself doesn’t know whether to believe the numbers and has ordered a doorstep check of all these beneficiaries. The startling figures tumbled out when the government set about to scrutinize the social security pension scheme in which senior citizens up to 79 years are given Rs 300 a month, and those elder to them get Rs 500.
 
  
  
 Officials were shocked by the figures for super-elderly and decided to do a reality check. Principal secretary  , who issued the order, said   officers will carry out the survey from March 14-16. A team of 235 officials will go to the addresses of these beneficiaries to see if all of them are genuine. If anyone is found to have died, their name will excluded from the list of beneficiaries. 
 
 The order has been marked to all department heads, divisional commissioners, municipal commissioners and chief executive officers of Janpad Panchayats.
 
 Officials said they have district-wise number and age of beneficiaries, which shows there are more senior citizens above 90 years in small towns than in cities of MP. With 103 centurions,   district has the maximum number of people above 100 years of age, followed by Sehore (99) and Ujjain (88). Sheopur has the lowest — three persons above 100 years of age. 
 
 Of the four main cities, Bhopal has 48 centurions on the pension list, Jabalpur 63, Indore 28 and Gwalior 26. Rajgarh also tops in the number of people above 90 years — a whopping 1,152. Rewa comes next with 1,042 and Sehore third with 938. This is surprising considering that Rajgarh is one of the most backward districts of the country and fares poorly on social development parameters like literacy (61%) and sex ratio (956).
 
 Bhopal has 466 beneficiaries above 90 years of age, Jabalpur 451, Indore 309 and Gwalior 251. Sheopur has lowest number of such beneficiaries — 38.
