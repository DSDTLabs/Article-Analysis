PANAJI: Stating that stakeholders of the liquor industry have been suffering a loss of around Rs 2 lakh on a daily basis following the Supreme Court’s verdict to ban the sale of alcohol within a 500m radius of highways across the country, the   has said that it, along with the retail traders association, will jointly lead the fight against the ban.

 The association said members from both the bodies will meet chief minister   to discuss the future course of action. A joint meeting will take place the next day.
 
 “We are trying to persuade the state government and the chief minister to file a curative petition, or an application within the same petition, seeking exemption for Goa as this is the only solution,” spokesperson of the All Goa Liquor Traders, Bar and Restaurant Owners Association, advocate  , said, adding that a majority of bars and retailers are along the highway. The association is seeking an exemption on grounds that a majority of the state’s population resides close to highways.
 
 “Exemption from the judgement, similarly taken by Sikkim and Meghalaya, is the only solution. Bars and restaurants will not be able to find a place or sustain their business at new locations. Loss of livelihood will affect a quarter of the total population as a big network of people are associated with the industry,” Palekar said. 
 
 He also clarified that the discontent among members due to the supposed lack of action by the association is only a communication gap.
