FAIZABAD: Uttar Pradesh   minister   once again praised   on Monday and compared him with Mahatma Gandhi,   and Sardar Patel.

 
 Like Gandhi, Nehru and Patel, Jinnah had fought for freedom of India, Maurya said, adding the demand to remove Jinnah's portrait from  's student union hall was unjust.
 
 "It is not just to remove Jinnah's photo that was installed before Independence. There is also Jinnah's signature on the draft of Partition of the country along with those of Gandhi, Nehru and Patel," Maurya had told reporters in Ambedkarnagar district on Sunday night.
 
 "If people raise fingers at 'mahapurush' (great personalities), who contributed to nation-building, then it's a matter of shame. Even Jinnah contributed towards nation-building before Partition," he had said.
