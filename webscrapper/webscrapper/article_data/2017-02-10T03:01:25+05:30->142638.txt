NEW DELHI: The   has filed a chargesheet against Arshi Qureshi, an employee of controversial Islamic preacher  's NGO IRF, for allegedly spreading hatred against India, radicalising youngsters and providing support to IS. 

  Along with Qureshi, NIA has named in its chargesheet one Abdul   alias Rashi, who is absconding. 
 
  A Kasargod-based person had alleged that his son   and his associates were indoctrinated into extreme jihadi ideology by members of Islamic Research Foundation. Arshi Qureshi, a guest relations manager with IRF, was arrested in July last year for radicalising Majeed and others from the Kerala IS module. 
 
 Around 22 men and women from these two districts in Kerala went to IS-held territory last year after they were radicalised. "Abdulla showed them videos of IS and also gave them lectures on violent jihad. He also financed the travel and stay of some of the missing youths," said NIA.
 
  As first reported by TOI , NIA is also looking into suspicious payments of Rs 42 lakh to Arshi Qureshi by IRF. It is suspected that this amount could have been used to fund travel of IS suspects from Kerala. IRF is already under scanner for paying Rs 1.5 lakh to Rajasthan-based IS operative Abu Anas in the form of scholarship payments. 
 
  IRF had come out in support of Arshi saying, "He has never forced a single person into conversion against his or her free will, as it is against Islam. We deny all allegations".
