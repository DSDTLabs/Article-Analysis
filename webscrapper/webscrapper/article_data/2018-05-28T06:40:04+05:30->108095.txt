LUCKNOW: Candidates who have applied for postgraduation in business economics or Sanskrit at Lucknow   will not be required to appear in entrance tests. Reason: These courses have more seats than the total applications received.

 
  has 10 postgraduation courses where applications received are lesser than the number of seats. Therefore, the university has decided not to conduct entrance tests for these courses. Instead, it will admit candidates on the basis of their marks in graduation. In all, the university runs 62 PG courses.
 
 Last year, no entrance test was held in 26 PG courses.Besides, LU is unlikely to run MA French   this year because it has received only seven applications for 40 seats. This is below the mandatory criterion to run a course. As per LU rules, the number applications should be 40% of the total seats for running a course.
 
 LU admission coordinator, PG admissions,   said, “The admission committee will take a final decision on whether MA French would be run this year.”
