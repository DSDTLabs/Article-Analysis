  “Terrace gardening is the latest trend in the city. Having a terrace garden is now a status symbol as one has to spend no less than Rs 25,000 on it. The expense goes up if one uses picnic chairs or decorative tables,” said Amit Kumar, head consultant at an architectural firm,
  
  According to Peeush Tripathi, owner of a landscaping consultant firm in Kankarbagh, terrace gardens are in vogue among Patnaites. “People are so busy that they do not have time to take a walk or go to a park for recreational activities. Terrace gardens help people stay away from the commotion of every day city life,” he said.
  
  Tripathi, who recently created terrace gardens in two houses on Boring Road and Nala Road, further said, “You can also have potted plants in a balcony where leafy vegetables and herbs can be grown. If there is lack of space, you can grow plants and vegetables in baskets and hang them.”
  
  Gardening enthusiast Satish Charanpahari, who has a roof top garden in his Boring Road apartment since 2004, told TOI, “Since the trend of building terrace gardens was not popular in   almost 13 years ago, a team of experts from Kolkata built my garden. The two most important things to remember before building a roof top garden is to have proper provision for water drainage and keep in mind the amount of load that your terrace can bear. I have big trees like mango, guava and lychee planted in my terrace garden. Along with them, I also produce ladies' fingers, chillies, bitter gourd, bottle gourd, sponge gourd and beans.”
