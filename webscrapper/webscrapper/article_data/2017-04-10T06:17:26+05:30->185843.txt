To address such issues, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel will hold an adalat of all stakeholders," said minister for statistics and programme implementation D V Sadananda Gowda. 
 
  "We want the IT/BT crowd in Bengaluru, their relatives here to patronize the train. This will happen when the timings are adjusted in a manner that people not only get the chance to savour the beauty of Western Ghats, but also reach home quicker," he said.
