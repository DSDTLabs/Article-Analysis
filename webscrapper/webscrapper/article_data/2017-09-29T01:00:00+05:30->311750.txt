BEGUSARAI: Begusarai sadar hospital on Thursday organized a seminar on ‘Epidemiology and prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD)’ with an aim to update local doctors and paramedical staff of the hospital with the growing health threat. The event was organized to mark World Heart Day which will be observed on September 29. 

 Dr Pramod Kumar Singh, a senior physician of the hospital, said India accounted for around 1.8 million CAD deaths in 2015, a significant jump from one million deaths in 2010. “The total number of deaths worldwide due to various heart   stood at 8.8 million, thus making it the most potent causes of deaths,” he said. 
 
 There has been a steady rise in the incidence of cardio vascular diseases among the lower socio-economic groups which defies the popular notion that only people from high socio-economic bands are vulnerable to the disease. “Recent studies reveal that with growing income, unhealthy lifestyle and unawareness, people from lower socio-economic groups have become more prone to heart diseases,” he said.
 
 The doctors participating in the programme identified nine modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, abdominal obesity and lack of fruits and vegetables in daily diet. Besides, poor cardiovascular rehabilitative measures result in high cardio vascular disease mortality in South Asian countries, they said. 
 
 The event was presided by Begusarai civil surgeon Hari Narayan Singh. Dr Anand Kumar Sharma and Dr Ajit Kumar Sinha also spoke on the occasion.
