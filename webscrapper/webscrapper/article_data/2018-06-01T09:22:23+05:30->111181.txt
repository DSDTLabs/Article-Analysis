CHANDIGARH: After a   was detected in the audit of 1,535 private educational institutions in disbursing post matric   for scheduled caste students, the   cabinet has decided not to release the said amount and to slap 9% penal interest on the institutes.

 
  
 
 The cabinet also gave a nod on Thursday to the welfare department to initiate immediate legal, criminal and administrative action against the defaulting education institutes where objectionable amount is more than Rs 50 lakhs. The action against all defaulting institutes would be taken through the concerned line departments after issuing a show cause notice in each case.
 
 The council of minister, however, decided to release the pending valid funds to private educational institutions so that scheduled caste students do not face hardship on the account of the ongoing financial scrutiny.
 
 The 9% penal interest will be calculated as on date of release of the valid amount mentioned in the audit report. At the same time, the cabinet said the release of valid scholarship amount would not absolve the educational institutions of any criminal liability for any irregularity found in the audit reports.
 
 Till April 27, the government has received audit reports of 1,535 education institutions out of a total of 3,606. The audit process for the rest is still in progress.
