When celebs embark upon promotional journeys for their films, they unleash several stunning style statements and that’s exactly what 
  is doing. The actress seems to be bringing along a goofy vibe for the promotions of her upcoming film, ‘Noor’ where she plays a tad clumsy journalist. Must say, she aced each and every look effortlessly.

 At a recent event, the ‘Dabangg’ actress was spotted donning a collared cold shoulder bell sleeved dress with a front tie detail and asymmetrical hem. The highlight of her dress was obviously the quirky patchwork of a lady with specs, in sync with her character in the film.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 It may be recollected that a few weeks back, ‘Phillauri’ star 
  too was spotted in a similar outfit. The actress wore an off-white Kokoon dress with a crisp collar and bell sleeves.
