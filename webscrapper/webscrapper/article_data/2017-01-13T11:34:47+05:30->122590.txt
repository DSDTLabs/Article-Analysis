 Prime Minister   awarded DC Rai Mahimapat Ray for the effort he and his team put in for making the two panchayats cashless in 16 days. However, the administrative officials are thankful that the Centre appreciated their efforts by giving them the opportunity to organize Digi Dhan Mela 
 
 Ray said that the fair will host a cluster of entertaining events. "There will be a kite competition, lucky draw and other games. As the fair is being organized on Makar Sankranti, there will be counters serving tilkut, khichdi, dahi-chuda and others. Entire area will have free Wi-Fi. Besides, there will be counters of banks, different departments of administration and 150 stalls of garments, food, decoration and others," said the DC.
