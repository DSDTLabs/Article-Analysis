New Delhi: RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), the largest trade union in the country, has demanded that the government immediately roll back the decision of   to hike fares in Delhi metro services, set to be effective from October 1.   has threatened to start an agitation if the demand for rollback of fares is not heeded to.

 With both the Centre and the Delhi government being partners on the DMRC board, the demand of BMS is technically addressed to both governments. But since Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is also against the fare hike and has written to the DMRC chairman to roll back the decision, the BMS’s decision is seen as clearly building pressure on the Centre. 
 
 Saying that the hike would add to the woes of the already burdened common man in the national capital region, BMS has argued that the public transport system in Delhi has always been and continues to be very poor and the metro has been a saviour for people who have no access to private vehicles and have to travel from far-flung areas in the  . “A hike in prices now would make it difficult for the common man to afford it and would also put pressure on Delhi’s roads that are already congested by private vehicles,” BMS general secretary   said in a statement on Thursday.
 
 The statement also mentions how “Delhi’s pollution levels are fearfully high and more vehicles on the road would only worsen the environmental situation of the city,” as it demanded that metro fares should be kept at affordable levels.
 
 Speaking of the workers, the BMS general secretary said, “Industrialists and employers in Delhi are not ready to pay approved minimum wages to their workers and in such a situation the hike would ensure that the only means of travel, the metro, available for workers would become unaffordable for them.”
 
 Citing the fare hikes of metro tickets in Delhi over the years since 2002, BMS has said that “in 15 years the minimum fare has gone up by 2.5% and maximum fare by 7.5 %, which is against the basic principle of running a public transport system”.
