Over the last two days, news has been rife that   and Manoj Bajpayee’s ' ' might not release on 
 

 'Aiyaary' is a thriller that revolves around a senior Army officer played by Manoj and his protégé portrayed by Sidharth, who develop ideological differences. Sources close to the film revealed that since it has Army as the backdrop, officials from the Ministry of Defence wanted to watch the film before its certification. The movie was screened for the defence personnel and the Revising Committee in Delhi 
 
 
 According to another source, the cuts are yet to be officially communicated to the film’s makers although they have been intimated about it, and the makers are not too pleased with the amendments suggested. “There’s not much time left for the film’s release. It will take a day for the makers to make the changes that have been asked for. Only if everything goes smoothly and on time, can they expect the certificate to reach them by late 
  morning. This can have an impact on the film’s international release because prints have to be dispatched and that can’t be done without attaching the final certificate,” says the source. 
 
 When we reached out to Jayantilal Gada, one of the producers of the film, he confirmed the developments and said, “We are yet to get a written communication about the changes that we are expected to incorporate in the film. So, we don’t yet have clarity on whether the film can release on the scheduled date or not.”
