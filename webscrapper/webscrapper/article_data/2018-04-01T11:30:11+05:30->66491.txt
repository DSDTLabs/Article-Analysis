CHANDIGARH: Members of   (CHB) Residents' Welfare Federation held a day-long hunger protest in Sector 41 on Saturday against the penal cost imposed by CHB for illegal constructions. While 21 protesters, have observed a fast that will end at 10.30am on Sunday, 51 ended their fast in the evening. 

 CHB has imposed penalty of Rs 100 per square feet for the modifications done by the dwelling unit owners. The penal costs have to be paid by March 31, 2018.
 
 "These houses were built 30 years ago. With the passage of time, the space became inadequate for the demands of the residents. Penal cost on those constructions amounts to lakhs of rupees. Moreover, it is to be paid annually lest you face cancellation. That means we have become a tenant in our own houses. These penal charges are not even mentioned in the policy applicable to us," said core committee member of the federation Rajat Malhotra. 
 
 "We have been used by every political party. We were promised a solution within three months of coming to power. Instead, we have been served with notices after four years. Annual payment of the penal cost is not justified whatsoever. We can afford to pay it as a one-time cost, but paying it every year is not feasible. The penal cost amounts to more than the original cost of the dwelling unit," said Vijay Kumar, member of Duplex Welfare Association, Sector 41.
 
 As per the federation's official statement, penal charges have also been raised for the constructions that had been given relaxation by CHB earlier.
 
 The protest was marked by the presence of leaders from all political parties including BJP, Congress, AAP, BSP, Akali Dal, CPI(M), CPI(ML), who pledging their support to the grieving residents against the penalties imposed by CHB.
