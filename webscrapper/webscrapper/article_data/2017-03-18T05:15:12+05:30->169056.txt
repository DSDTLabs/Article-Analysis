MUMBAI: There was a showdown at the   inauguration on Friday evening at Veermata Jijabai Bhosale Udyan and zoo in Byculla.   chief   and his son Aaditya inaugurated the enclosure at the zoo. But the penguin viewing area was shut immediately after they finished the ribbon-cutting ceremony and proceeded to the function area. 

 Press photographers and visitors who had rushed to catch a glimpse of the birds were shocked on seeing the curtains pulled down. Doctors at the enclosure said the flash of cameras being used by photographers was disturbing the birds and they were forced to shut it. After the inauguration, when the Thackerays arrived at the enclosure to view the birds, the curtains were raised again. When photographers inquired about it, they were told that it was time for the birds to sleep. 
 
 Uddhav took a dig at BJP, when he said that a “transparent” glass was put for people to view the birds. 
 
 Despite a high court ruling, posters and flags were put up all around zoo to welcome the Thackerays.
 
 Meanwhile, former Opposition leader in  , Pravin Chedda, insisted that the penguins’ western names (Donald, Daisy, Olive, Popeye, Mr Molt, Bubble and Flipper) should be Indian.
