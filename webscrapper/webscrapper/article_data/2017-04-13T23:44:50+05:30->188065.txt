Ahmedabad: Parents of students of city-based Asia School and also DPS Gandhinagar staged protests outside respective school premises on Thursday over fee-related issues. Parents have sought that school authorities levy fees in accordance with the annual cap of Rs15,000 imposed by the government. “Currently, the school levies Rs 60,000 per annum as fees which is way above the cap set by the state government through the recent fee regulation bill. Therefore, school authorities should only levy Rs 15,000 as fees at present,” said a parent protesting outside DPS Gandhinagar. tnn
