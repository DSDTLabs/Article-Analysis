KOLKATA:   has been repaired two days ahead of deadline, and traffic is plying normally on it.

 On Monday, cars and buses were taking the bridge, and banners that had been put up in   and Dhakuria to make people aware of the repair were removed. Commuters were relieved as buses were no longer being detoured to facilitate the repair that started on the night of December 1.
 
 A 40-day deadline had been fixed by KMDA, the bridge’s custodians. Repair of the bridge couldn’t be planned all these years because of the challenges involved in regulating traffic. “The erstwhile government was not ready to do the repair like it was done now, leaving portions of the bridge open to traffic,” said urban development minister and KMDA chairman Firhad Hakim.
 
 In fact, KMDA had fixed a 40-day repair period because the police had preconditioned traffic access. Rising to the challenge, the agency has finished the job ahead of its Wednesday deadline. “We have completed repairs of Dhakuria bridge in advance. The structure is now more secure and better prepared for taking the regular traffic load,” said Soumitra Mohan, KMDA’s chief executive officer.
 
 The repair included replacement of two expansion joints that connect the span over the rail tracks. “All this time, south-bound buses had to detour from Golpark via Southern Avenue-Boroj Road-Lake Gardens flyover and Prince Anwar Shah Road to reach Jadavpur PS. Thank God the repair is over and restrictions have been lifted,” said   resident Sushmita Haldar, who had a trying time dropping her kids at her parents’ at Jadavpur every morning.
