NEW DELHI: An FIR has been registered against 24   for misbehaving and illegally confining the varsity vice-chancellor   to the administrative block. The police had received a complaint from the registrar of the university on March 4.

 On February 9, several students sat inside the administrative block near the proctor’s office demanding a meeting with the VC. When Kumar finally arrived, the students allegedly misbehaved with him.
 
 The students have been booked under the IPC section of wrongful restraint. Police said that the charge of common intention was added to the FIR after a former student council member threatened to commit suicide on February 28 if the VC did not meet them.
 
 The complaint says that the blockade had prevented Kumar from entering his office. The blockade was called to oppose the implementation of the May 5, 2016 UGC notification, which many students claim would “affect the admissions of MPhil and PhD students and disrupt the unique admission policy of the university.” The students had demanded a rollback of the UGC notification.
 
 The accused named in the FIR includes those students who were suspended by the VC after they had allegedly disrupted the academic council (AC) meeting on December 26 last year. The suspended students had continued the struggle against the UGC notification with hunger strike and sit-ins.
 
 Police said that the accused students would be called in for questioning. Sources said that five of them are students’ union leaders.
