LUCKNOW: On a day when his party bagged success with twin victories in   byelections, former chief minister and   chief   wrote to UP government requesting for a room in the state guest house. 

 
 Akhilesh has asked for four suites to be reserved for his temporary stay in a state guest house in Lucknow.
 
 The move comes days after the Supreme Court asked former Uttar Pradesh chief ministers to vacate their official residences. 
 
  Akhilesh had been staying out of his 4, Vikramaditya Marg bungalow in Lucknow. 
 
 In the letter addressed to the state estate department officer, Akhilesh has written, "I request that four rooms-one for myself and others in the name of Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav and   MPs Sanjay Seth and Sunder Nagar-be reserved from May 31 evening for party work."
 
 While   ( ) chief and former chief minister Mayawati had recently converted her 4, Mall Avenue bungalow into a memorial named after party founder Kanshi Ram, her request is still pending with the UP government.
 
 Having Z-plus security cover with ample space required for security officers, Akhilesh too had earlier sought a two-year period to extend his stay in his present residence and subsequently approached the Supreme Court.
 
 However, that appeal is still pending before the apex court. After that, Akhilesh had said he was looking for a rented house.
 
 Both Akhilesh and his father SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav have confirmed they will eventually stay in rented accommodations in Lucknow.
 
 Earlier, Union home minister Rajnath Singh had vacated his official residence and taken up a private residence in Gomtinagar.
