THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Giving a clean chit to Idukki MP Joyce George against whom cases have been pending over land encroachment, chief minister   told the assembly on Thursday that the MP had inherited the property mentioned by the opposition members.

 “The UDF had launched an attack on George after he contested as a CPM (independent) candidate to win the Lok Sabha election in 2014. He was portrayed as a land-grabber and the UDF government slapped false cases against him. The fact is that he had inherited his family property in Idukki,“ he said. The chief minister's clarification came after Congress MLA Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan challenged revenue minister   to take action against George.
 
 Pointing out that the Congress leader's remark was in correct, Vijayan demanded its removal from the assembly records. However, disputing the CM's statement and alleging that he was misleading the house, another senior Congress leader   said there were two pending cases in Devikulam magistrate court against George for encroaching 32 acres in   ary in the district. “George and his family were involved in the 32-acre land-grab in Kurinji Sanctuary , which, in no way can be an inherited property. The chief minister has been misleading the assembly,“ he said waving certain documents related to the case, which he said could be tabled if required.
 
 Though Thomas' argument after gaining permission under rule 286 (where a member can pose questions through the Speaker) triggered a commotion in the house, speaker   intervened to end it citing inappropriate use of the rules of procedure.
