AHMEDABAD:   ( ) has introduced a separate facility for surface movement control for aircraft and vehicles moving on the ground at   (SVPI) Airport on Wednesday. 

 With this facility, the work done by sa ingle ATC officer in the control tower will now be shared by two ATC officers. One will provide services on the runway and in the air in the vicinity of aerodrome, and the other ATC officer will provide services on the ground which includes the push-back, start-up and taxi clearances for aircraft.
 
 Apart from this separate facility, the AAI will start ground control radar at the city airport to enhance the ATC surveillance during low visibility, rains and at night.
 
 Manoj Gangal, director of SVPI airport, said in an official release, “As a first step, this new facility is started during the lean period of daily traffic so that the ATCOs and pilots can familiarize themselves with the new system and its associated standard operating procedures.”
 
 The statement adds, “After this familiarization, with effect from August 1, timings of this facility will be from 7am to 10am daily when normally the traffic density at Ahmedabad airport is high.”
 
 “Pilots will be the chief beneficiary of the new facility as there will be less congestion on the voice communication channel of the control tower,” reads the statement, adding, “This will translate into reducing delay in the air-to-ground and ground-to-ground communication between pilots and ATCOs.”
 
 Gangal said that with a separate ATCO to handle traffic on ground, the ATCOs in control tower will be able to pay undivided attention to aircraft landing and take-offs from the runway.
