BHUBANESWAR:   were thought to be among the reasons that forced  's hands while dropping some of the known faces from his ministry. But what came as a surprise to many was the inclusion of the likes of  , Prafulla Samal, Surjya Narayan Patro, Niranjan Pujari and Pratap Jena, men who were embroiled in controversies and had been ignored when Naveen formed his government - for the fourth successive term - in 2014. 

 "The CM boasts of clean image and probity in public life. But look at his decision of recalling tainted ministers like Maheswar Mohanty and Prafulla Samal, who were in the news for the wrong reasons. Could Naveen not find anyone else or new MLAs for his ministry? It seems he has lost the authority. His public image has eroded," BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said.
 
 Five-time MLA Mohanty, who was a minister holding different portfolios between 2011 and 2014, was in the eye of the storm for his alleged involvements in land scam and the Swargadwar land grab in Puri. Being chairman of Nabakalebara infrastructure development committee, Mohanty had miserably failed to boost the infrastructure of Puri during the 2015 festival. 
 
 Samal, a five-time MLA, was in-charge of different ministries from 1990 till 2012. Samal landed in trouble in the past after he and his son Prayaskanti allegedly sold a piece of land which was meant for a private college in Bhadrak.
 
 Six-time MLA Patro, who was a minister from 1990 till 2012, had his brush with controversy after the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (CAG) in 2012-13 pointed out anomaly in land lease to a city-based hotel promoted by his son. 
 
 Congress secretary   said those leaders, who staged a comeback to the ministry, had utterly failed to perform their duties in their previous terms.
