There couldn’t have been a better way to welcome Valentine’s Day for  . The actor, who was earlier in a relationship with controversy’s favourite child  , got engaged to  , his girlfriend of two years, on Sunday in a hush-hush ceremony. 
Abhishek says, “I wanted it to be a low-key affair keeping in mind the fact that Ankita and her family don’t belong to the industry. The ceremony took place in Mumbai at my house. We had a blast with my close friends at the after-party, celebrating the new beginning of my life.”
 The couple is now in the process of finalising the wedding date. “I want it to be a winter wedding, which will happen this year itself,” he states.
 On the work front, he will be seen as Kroor Singh’s aide Ahmed in the fantasy show 'Prem Ya Paheli... Chandrakanta'.
