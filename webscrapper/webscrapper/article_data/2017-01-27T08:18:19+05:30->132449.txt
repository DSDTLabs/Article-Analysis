BENGALURU: Marching down Rajpath in New Delhi as part of the   parade had been a longstanding dream for 19-year-old

 Aishwarya AG of Kodagu. On Thursday, as part of the  , the NCC senior under officer from the Karnataka-Goa Directorate was seen at the head of the all-girl contingent. This was the first time after 18 years that a girl from the directorate had been given the honour.
 
 Although Aishwarya attended the R-Day camp in Delhi last year, she couldn’t participate in the march past, owing to her junior rank (she was a junior wing officer in 2016). 
 
 "Looking at all the senior officers march down Rajpath last year, I imagined what it would be like to lead the contingent," Aishwarya said.
 
 A year later, that is exactly where she found herself. A student of St Joseph’s Girls’ Composite Pre University College, Aishwarya spoke to TOI hours after she led the contingent at the Republic Day parade. 
 
 Aishwarya said that it had not been easy for her to
 
 bag the honour. 
 
 "The competition was fierce, and to be chosen from more than a hundred cadets is an honour," she said.
 
 Her parents, relatives and friends back in Kodagu were overjoyed to see her lead a contingent at the parade. 
 
 "A lot of people back home know that this is my passion, and they supported me throughout. Also, there are many Army officers in Kodagu, who were very encouraging," she added.
