NOIDA: A 28-year-old   has alleged that two men who offered her a   on a bike raped her near the   bypass on Thursday night. The woman, a resident of Bulandshahr, said she had come to   for some personal work and was on her way back home in the evening when the two men known to her — she identified them as Praveen and Arun — offered her the lift. The woman is a mother of four and her husband expired a few years ago.

 “I was standing near a bus stop when the two men reached there on a bike and offered me a lift. They took me to a deserted location near the Dadri   where two more persons joined them. They kept beating me as Pravin and Arun took turns to rape me,” the woman said. Pravin and Arun are residents of Kalaunda village in Greater Noida, she said.
 
 The woman claimed she had visited the Dadri police station on Thursday night but the cops apparently refused to take any action. On Friday morning, she secured a directive from Surajpur court to police to lodge an FIR.  , who heads the legal aid clinic of the district legal services authority, said he had accompanied the woman to the police station following the court order. “Police are not registering any FIR into the matter. We have been waiting here for the past two hours,” he said on Friday afternoon.
 
 Dadri circle officer Nishank Sharma, however, said police had registered a case and were investigating the matter. “The woman has been sent for medical examination and reports are awaited. We will take action based on investigation and evidence,” he said. The woman said Pravin was known to her. “After my husband’s death in 2009, Pravin started making advances towards me. In 2015, he took me to a local temple and performed ‘marriage’ to acquire my property. He lived with me for some time and married another woman in 2017,” she alleged.
