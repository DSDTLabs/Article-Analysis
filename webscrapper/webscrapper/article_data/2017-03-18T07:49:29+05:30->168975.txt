AHMEDABAD:   at Nalsarovar caught six persons with six flamingos including two dead birds for poaching the birds at  , the only Ramsar wetland site in the state.

 Range forest officer S M Patel said: “During a routine patrol, we noticed a kite flying near Panwad Bet. The official immediately rushed to the spot and detained six people. On checking, we found 15 kites, nylon thread and four spools of thread used for flying kites.”
 
  “We also recovered six flamingos including a dead one. Two birds were released as they were found to be fit, one was shifted to a Limbdi   and another died on the way Limbdi.”
 
 Officials said the six people arrested included Mahesh Gebab, Chanda Dhahiwala, Bhagubhaui Ramanbhai, Bharat Godabhai, Vinubahi Masali and Isanbhai Chetabhai. All six were resident of Dharji village near the lake. The forest department also seized fibre boats.
 
 Poaching in Nalsarovar is usually done with nets tied to killing trapped birds. Patel said, the modus operandi of the six was simple. Three or four of them would fly kites in an areas with birds. One person would disturb the bird by pelting stones. As the birds fly in a flock, a couple of them get trapped in the nylon thread and fall.
 
 The six suspects told forest officials that that they killed the birds to eat and did not sell them. Large scale poaching had been discovered in the past and the birds were sold at local street-side eateries. However, the forest department could not nail the eateries in earlier incidents. These six accused will be produced in court on Saturday.
