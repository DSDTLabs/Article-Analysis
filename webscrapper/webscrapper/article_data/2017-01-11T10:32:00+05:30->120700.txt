LUCKNOW: The Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance may not have been formally announced yet, but the two parties appeared on Tuesday to be racing ahead with their plans to kickstart a joint election campaign led by Gandhi siblings Rahul and Priyanka, along with Akhilesh and Dimple Yadav, later this week.

 Confirming the development, sources here told TOI that the ongoing

The  , in front of which a petition submitted by both sides is pending, is expected to hear them out on January 13. A ruling favourable to Akhilesh could lead to the launch of the alliance the same day, the sources said.   general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad urged “secular forces” to close ranks on Tuesday, a remark seen as ending the ambiguity around the Congress-SP alliance.
 
 Congress’s chief ministerial face in UP, Sheila Dikshit, even suggested that

 The Congress is known to have pushed for a 105-seat partnership with the SP for the 403-member House. Incidentally, Akhilesh and Mulayam have struck contrarian positions on a pre-poll alliance. While UP chief minister Akhilesh believes an alliance with the Congress will help SP, Mulayam, it appears, thinks otherwise.
