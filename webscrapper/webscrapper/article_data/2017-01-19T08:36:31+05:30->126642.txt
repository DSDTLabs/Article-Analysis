NEW DELHI: Concerned over the shortage of   judges despite repeated directions of the   for speedy recruitment, Chief Justice JS Khehar announced on Wednesday that he had set up a judges' committee to suggest ways and means for expeditious filling up of vacancies.

 Senior advocate Vijay Hansaria sought an urgent hearing of the case titled 'Malik Mazhar Sultan', in which the apex court had, in January 2007, laid down a schedule for high courts and public service commissions in states to fill up vacancies in the subordinate judiciary at all levels. The SC had requested the chief justices of high courts to set up committees of judges to monitor and oversee the timely selection and appointment of judicial officers as per the schedule.
 
 Hansaria, the amicus curiae in the case who has been assisting the court for more than a decade, told a bench headed by the CJI that despite the apex court's efforts, no real progress was achieved on the ground. He said that of the 21,017 sanctioned posts of judicial officers, 4,882 were vacant. What made the situation worse was the pendency of over 2.76 crore cases, he added. The CJI said he had constituted a committee to look into this issue and was expecting a report within a fortnight. Justice Khehar said it would be better to post the case for hearing along with the report of the judges' committee.
 
 In a judgment in the Imtiaz Ahmed case on January 2, the SC had laid down guidelines for formulating a scientific method to determine the number of trial judges required to erase the monstrous pendency and also deal with the gradual increase in the number of cases filed given the spread of literacy and accessibility of courts.
