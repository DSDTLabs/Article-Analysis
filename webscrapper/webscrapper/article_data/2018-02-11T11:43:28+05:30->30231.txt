MADURAI: Madurai Corporation’s move to construct an air-conditioned bus shelter near the bus bay at the Tallakulam main road has irked pedestrians and morning walkers as it hinders their walks and is putting their lives at risk. Corporation sources said that this bus shelter is being constructed at a cost of Rs 10 lakh from the Madurai North MLA’s fund.

 S Kavitha, a resident, said that this structure would be used only by alms-seekers to sleep, as nobody waits in this spot for long. “But, it could definitely lead to many accidents, when people walk on the road,” she said.
 
 Gopalsamy, a resident of  , said that he had been disturbed when the corporation started constructing this structure a few months ago. “It has encroached on the path. Now, many walkers are forced to walk the few hundred meters stretch on the road, and it proves to be risky as buses coming from behind tend to stop close by,” he said.
 
 A Asokan, another resident said, “I take my bike and come from Bibikulam to walk on the pavement here as there are temples along this path and it gives a good feel, but now this structure has forced us to either break our walk or take a detour by walking on the road,” he said.
 
 From the outpost junction to Tamukkam, Gandhi museum,   and outpost again is a good five kilometers walk. People said that encroached pavements are a common problem in all the cities, but when the civic body which is responsible for removing encroachments, uses its position as the owner of the pavement and constructs a structure there, it is not acceptable.
 
 Jayaseelan of  , a retired bus conductor said, “This is one bus stop where passengers do not have to wait for more than five minutes due to the frequency of buses, who is going to have the time to sit at the air-conditioned bus stop?” he said.
