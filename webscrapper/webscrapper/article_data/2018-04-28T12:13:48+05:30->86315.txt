KOLKATA: A 16-year-old’s dream of being a successful model — and earn fame through dancing — turned into a nightmare when three persons, including a woman, trapped her and made her pose for nude photos for her portfolio.

 The incident was reported from the the   area. Two persons have been arrested and were produced at   court on Friday. The duo have been sent to two weeks of judicial custody.
 
 When the girl — who had appeared for her Madhyamik exams this year — pleaded to cancel the shoot, her obscene photos were forwarded to her uncle.
 
 The three also threatened her saying the pictures will be circulated.
 
 The photo shoot was done on April 17. The victim’s family had lodged a complaint against three persons on April 21. On Friday, the cops managed to nab two of the accused. The  , which had lodged the FIR, said the hunt for the third accused is on.
 
 According to sources, the victim was a frequent visitor to a dancing school where she became friends with the three accused — Arunangshu   (24), Rituparna   (20) and   (22).
 
 The trio then asked her to visit an address for a photoshoot. “On April 17, the girl went as directed. Later, she was told that she needed to click obscene photos to “attract” attention. The two men forced her to open the clothes and molested her,” said police source.
 
 Cops said the accused used two mobile phones to click nine pictures. When the girl returned home, she was again asked to return for the shoot. When the girl refused, she was threatened and blackmailed. On August 21, the family lodged a complaint after her uncle was forwarded two of these photos.
 
 “We have arrested the two accused Ghosh and Saha and are looking for Roy. We have registered a case under IPC sections 120B pertaining to criminal conspiracy along with section 7, 11, 13 and 14 of Pocso Act. Section 67 of the Information Technology Act has also been added,” said a senior officer.
