CHANDIGARH: A   court declared Dera Sacha Sauda spokesperson Dr Aditya   as a proclaimed offender on Monday, nine months after he was booked for sedition over the August 25 violence in Panchkula after the Sirsa-based sect’s head, Gurmeet  , was convicted of rape.

 Dr Insan was booked two days after the violence. He has been on the run ever since. Panchkula chief judicial magistrate (CJM) Rohit Vats passed the order after a special investigation team (SIT), formed to probe the violence, submitted its report on why it could not arrest him. The SIT has already announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh on any information on him.
 
 The SIT informed the court that it pasted 10,000 posters of   across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. The posters have been pasted outside centres of the dera and busy public areas in cities.
 
 Dr   is accused being a key conspiractor of the August 25 violence last year. He managed to flee on the day violence broke out in Panchkula, minutes after Ram Rahim’s conviction in the case. He was among the group of key dera functionaries who allegedly provoked thousands of followers of Ram Rahim to take to violence.
 
 In all, 38 dera followers died in the police action for quelling the violence. Several were injured and around 1,900 followers were arrested.
 
 Meanwhile, Haryana Police on Monday also released a video highlighting names and photos of the absconding accused of the violence.
