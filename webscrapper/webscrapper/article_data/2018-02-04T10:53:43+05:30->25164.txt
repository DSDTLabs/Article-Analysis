AHMEDABAD: Personnel of the cyber cell of city crime branch raided a   at Cama Commercial Centre, just opposite the Mirzapur Court, late on Friday. Crime branch sources said they arrested four persons — Abdul Latif Shaikh, Danny Balotia, Sunil Kumavat and Aakash Kanojiya — while a key accused, Jaki alias Raju Shaikh, is on the run.

 Additional deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Rajdeepsinh Zala, said they have seized CPUs, a magicjack device, contact data of   and other devices from the office.
 
 Cyber cell inspector Jobdas Gaddam said the accused would cheat American citizens by calling them via the internet through a magicjack device or by email, offering them payday loans.
 
 “Once the American citizen being targeted was in their net, they used to extract $100 or $200 from them, on the pretext of a ‘processing fee’ and $150 as ‘insurance premium’. Once the money was transferred — through I- Tunes cards or MoneyGram — the accused would withdraw the money” added Gaddam.
 
 Cyber cell officials said the accused went to great lengths to dupe American citizens. “To net reluctant victims, they would ask for their bank account details and deposit a fake cheque in their account. The target would get a message on their cell phones about the cheque and would fall into the accused’s trap. They would then pay the ‘processing fee’ and ‘insurance premium’,” added a cyber cell official.
 
 Cyber cell officials said the targets would find out they were cheated when the cheque deposited was found to be fake. “The accused would get these fake cheques printed by a man name Habib. We are looking for Habib,” added a cyber cell official.
