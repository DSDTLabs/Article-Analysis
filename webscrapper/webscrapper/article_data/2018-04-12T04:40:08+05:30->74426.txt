KOLKATA:   services were disrupted for around 30 minutes on Wednesday after an 80-year-old man tried to commit suicide by jumping in front of a train at   station around 8.30am.

 Police and Metro officials were, however, able to rescue the man as they brought him out from underneath the train. He fell in a gap between the tracks and suffered severe head injuries.
 
 He is now undergoing treatment at MR Bangur Hospital. Cops initially had difficulty identifying the person. But as they began a probe, they identified a tailor’s name from his shirt’s collar. Soon, they were able to locate the person’s house and inform his relatives.
 
 Because of the incident, trains could not run between   and Tollygunge stations from 8.30am to 9am. Normal services could be restored only after 9am.
