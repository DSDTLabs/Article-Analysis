It was a happening Saturday at Tantra @ The Park when DJ  , the king of Bollywood music, amped up the party with some pulsating music. The creator of iconic dance hits and the remix of Flute fantasy created this signature magic on the console, making the party peeps go wild.

  
 DJ Nasha is an icon of experimental Indian electronic music and won the World DMC Championships for India in 1999 and 2000 in New York and London. This sent his career soaring, with the young DJ going on to produce the Flute fantasy remix. 
 
  
 The DJ, who had also played to an audience of more than 30,000 spectators at the 2010 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in New Delhi, told us that he loved playing to the Kolkata crowd. “It’s always great to be back in Kolkata and what’s even better is that I’m playing at Tantra tonight after a long time. 
 
  
 The vibe and energy of the nightclub is in a different league and I really love the electrifying atmosphere here,’’ he said.
