 Ssharad was previously in a relationship with Ye Hai Mohabbatein's  , but the two split after a seven-year courtship. Ssharad met and fell in love with Pooja earlier last year. The couple met through common friends.
  
 Sharad is one of the most sought after actors in the television industry. Apart from appearing in the fiction show that he is currently a part of, Sharad had also tried his hands at comedy by appearing on Comedy Nights Bachao Taaza. When the actor found it difficult to juggle between Comedy Nights Bachao and Kasam, he quit the former.
