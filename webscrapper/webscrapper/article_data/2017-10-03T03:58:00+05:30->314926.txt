KTCL authorities had recently asked shopkeepers for their electricity bills in order conduct an assessment of the power load at the Panaji KTC bus complex. The corporation was in the process of changing the entire electric wiring at the premises, which had not been done since 1982. There are a total of 176 shops at the complex. “Since 1982, nothing was done to rewire the area. Only additional wiring was done,” said managing director, KTCL, Derek Pereira Neto. “Our building’s structure has to be totally repaired, the cost of which will be over Rs 1 crore. We don’t have insurance, since it is a government building. The shop keepers, however, are insured,” he said. tnn
