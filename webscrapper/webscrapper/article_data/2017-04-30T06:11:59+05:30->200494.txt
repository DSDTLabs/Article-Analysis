SURAT: A 45-year-old-man, who is a native of Nepal, was convicted of raping a   and sentenced to   till his last breath by a special court set up to hear   (POCSO) Act cases in Valsad on Saturday. 

 Special judge M M Mansuri in his judgment described the act as monstrous and refused to give any relief to the convict. 
 
 Narbahadur Sarpbahadur Bhandari, a resident of Nagarpalika Quarters in Vapi, was convicted under Indian Penal Code section 376 (rape) and POCSO Act of raping the minor, who happened to be his friend’s daughter, in her house. 
 
 The rape survivor’s father and the convict are from the same village in Nepal. The father of the girl is a watchman of an apartment in Valsad and the convict had come to meet him on August 26, 2016. The convict was sleeping outside in the open that afternoon when the girl’s father asked him to sleep inside in his room. At that time the girl and her mother were not present in the house. They returned in the evening and her mother left her at home and went out for some work. 
 
 Meanwhile, the father was called by some residents of the apartment at around 7.30pm and he returned within 10 minutes. He noticed Bhandari leaving the apartment and his daughter bleeding from her private parts. He shouted for help and took the girl to a hospital for check-up. Medical examination confirmed that the child had been raped and suffered from severe injuries.
 
 “The court considered medical reports while announcing the punishment. It is a landmark judgment because a person has been given life imprisonment till his last breath for raping a minor,” public prosecutor A R Tripathi said.
