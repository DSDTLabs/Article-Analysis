LUCKNOW: Plan your financial   in advance as the banks will remain closed for four consecutive days next week, that is, from March 29 to April 1.

 
 The long closure would impact clearance of cheques worth Rs 6,000 crore in the city and transactions worth more than Rs eight lakh crore in the state.
 
 
 
 
 The salaried class in Lucknow, too, would get hit as the   transfer, which is generally done towards month-end, may get delayed owing to the long break.
 
 
 An official of a government   said, “Since banks remain close for public dealing in the last week of March we see huge rush in banks and ATMs for cash withdrawal during this time of the year. We would advice people to plan their transactions for next week before the banks close.”
 
 
 Bank officials said that as per the   rules some primary and government banking branches will remain open on March 31 for financial year closing but will not conduct public dealings.
