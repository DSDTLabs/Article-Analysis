AHMEDABAD: A   from across the state on Sunday held a ‘pakora protest’ at   near Subhash Bridge in the city, against the provision in the draft   (NMC) Bill for a   (Ayurveda, Yoga, Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) doctors to enable them practice  .

 The group of around 250 doctors and medical students from allopathy branch fried pakoras symbolically and displayed placards displaying a message, “Pakore ki kamayi aap lo, hame 2 crore rozgaar do” (you keep earnings from pakora selling, give us 2 crore employment). Another message reads, ask an autorickshaw driver to appear in bridge course so that he can fly an aircraft.
 
 Dr Sunil Shah, convener of the protest, said that NMC had introduced the provision in the bill of allowing the homoeopathy and Ayurvedic doctors to practice allopathy at a time when MBBS doctors are compelled to give the exit test after five years of the course to start their practice.
 
 “If they can come up with a magical machine called bridge course then they should give that machine to us, we will manufacture crores of the doctors from the crores of unemployed youths along with the BHMS and BAMS doctors of the country,” said Shah.
 
 Shah stressed that doctors of other branches like Ayurveda and homeopathy giving allopathic medicines to the patients can only lead to a state where in the patients’ body will develop resistance and that particular medicine will not be helpful.
 
 When asked about why they chose a ‘pakora protest’, Shah said, “It was a unique way to get our protest registered when the controversy over pakora selling as employment is being raked up.”
 
 Dr Raj Joshi from Rajkot said, “The doctors will be reduced to pakora sellers if such provisions of NMC bill including the 9-month bridge course and exit test for MBBS course are brought in.”
 
 Shah added, ‘The manner of protest reduced participation as earlier around 1,000 doctors assured their presence for the protest but it has reduced to 250 after the announcement of   because they want to avoid any adverse action from the state.”
