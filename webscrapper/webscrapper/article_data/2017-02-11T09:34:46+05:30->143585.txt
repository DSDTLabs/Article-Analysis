JAIPUR: The state   commission took   of the proposal by the   (JMC) to snap the drainage connection of the houses which have not paid the  , house tax or lease amount to the corporation and asked the principal secretary of local bodies and JMC CEO to submit a factual report by February 28.

 According to the proposal, the JMC would give seven days’ notice to the defaulters and if it is not complied with, then the civic body would block the drainage of the house till the payment is made.
 
 The commission chairman Justice   said the decision in itself is a violation of human rights and smacks of insensitivity. 
 
 When the nation has been witnessing a cleanliness drive, a local body’s threat to block the drainage is neither in tune with the time nor practical, it said. It asked had the JMC thought over the consequences of such abrasive decisions?
 
 The commission asked just because the JMC has a duty to provide an essential service, for the sake of money could it deprive the citizens of an essential service?
 
 The commission wondered if the JMC has assessed the adverse consequence of such a decision on the neighbours of a defaulter at congested residential locality and those living in multi-storeyed buildings. 
 
 The commission said it was unfair to take such decisions for whatever be the reasons. It said according to a report, the JMC has an accumulated unpaid house tax of Rs 682 crore. JMC has failed to collect the tax over the years resulting in its financial position going from bad to worse. It said the JMC and its officials who have failed to discharge their duty of collecting taxes on time could not now impose such draconian measures on the people.
