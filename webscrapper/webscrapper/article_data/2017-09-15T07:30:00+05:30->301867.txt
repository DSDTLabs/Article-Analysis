Chandigarh: Even as the list containing the names of the institutions whose Foreign Contribution Regulation Act ( ) licence has been cancelled features Panjab University, university officials state that it has been exempted since it is a government institution and can still receive the foreign donations and funds.

 “Since we are a government institution, we have been exempted from getting this FCRA licence for foreign donations and grants. This notification will have no impact on us since we have been exempted since 2011,” said   finance development officer (FDO) Vikram Nayyar. 
 
 Sources said that the university, however, does not get many foreign donations. According to the university records, it was in 2015 when the Getty Foundation, USA, awarded a grant of US $1,30,000 to conduct a study to preserve Gandhi Bhawan under the conservation of Heritage buildings project. 
 
 Moreover, it was in October 2016 that wife of eminent economist and former Chair professor at Panjab University (PU) professor Ajit Singh, Ann Zammit had donated 5,000 UK Pound to the PU Department of Economics as an endowment. The endowment would finance an annual Professor Ajit Singh Memorial Lecture at PU.
 
 Another PU alumnus and founder CEO of Sun Deep Cosmetics Inc, California, USA, Jaswant Singh Gill, donated an endowment amount of Rs 1.30 crore (over 2 Lac USD) for providing scholarships to the students and research scholars of University Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS) on "Need-cum-Merit-basis" in 2015. 
 
 Among the institutions whose FCRA licence has been cancelled includes Jawaharlal Nehru University, University Of Delhi, Indian Institute Of Technology in Delhi, Panjab University and others. 
 
 Their registration was cancelled since these institutions failed to file their annual returns for five consecutive years. Cancellation of FCRA licence implies that these institutions cannot receive funds from abroad unless it is registered under the FCRA.
