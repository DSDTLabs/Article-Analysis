DEHRADUN: The Congress and the BJP seem to be evenly poised in the race to win the March 9 election for Karnprayag constituency, whose Gairsain city was catapulted to prominence after both the national parties promised to make it  's new capital years ago. 

 However, the Congress has a lot at stake not only because it launched a string of development projects in its attempt to develop Gairsain as the hill state's capital, but also because its senior leader and assembly deputy speaker Ansuya Prasad   is in the fray from the seat.
 
 Both the parties have been trying to highlight their initiatives to develop Gairsan as an alternative to Dehradun. In the last five years, the Congress government has initiated a string of measures at Gairsan such as construction of a new assembly building, MLA hostel and roads in the area. In the 2012 elections, Maikhuri had defeated independent candidate   by a slender margin of 227 votes. While Maikhuri got 11,147 votes, Negi was a close second with 10,920 votes. 
 
 This time Negi has been fielded by the BJP as party candidate. Sensing the importance of the seat, chief minister   has shifted his entire focus to Karnprayag. On Tuesday too, Rawat held a series of meetings and undertook a padyatra in the constituency.
