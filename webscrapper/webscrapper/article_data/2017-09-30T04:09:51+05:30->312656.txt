Mumbai: The   department on Friday seized 2kg of gold believed to be part of the 38kg gold smuggled in from Thailand, and arrested two  , Raju Pradhan and Manoj Desai. 

 On Wednesday, the special intelligence and investigation branch had arrested two men for smuggling in 38kg gold, worth Rs 11 crore, concealed in a container declared as women’s slippers. One of the arrested accused, the   Mushtaq Abubacker, reportedly told the officials that he had smuggled in 40kg of gold, but the officials only found 38kg gold. 
 
 The 2kg seizure was made by another unit of the Customs department. A senior official from the marine and preventive wing of the customs told TOI that they acted on specific intelligence and seized the gold from the loaders’ residences. “We are not saying this is part of the the same consignment. Moreover, we do not know if they stole from the   or someone handed it over to them. We are treating this as an independent case,” the official said. 
 
 Sources said it is likely that the loaders could have slipped out the gold while unloading the consignment. “It is strange that the loaders managed to remove when Customs officials were present,” the source said.
 
 In a related development, Abubacker and Ravindra Haldankar of Sharda Clearing were produced in court on Friday and remanded in police   for 14 days. Haldankar said he had imported the consignment on behalf of siblings Zuber and Iliyas Peerzade. Abubakcer’s lawyer Ravi Hirani said his client had no knowledge that the consignment contained gold. “He has been falsely implicated in the case,” Hirani claimed.
