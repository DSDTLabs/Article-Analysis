KOLKATA: Looking for a weekend getaway? There are 44 destinations to choose from and counting. 

 Acting on chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s suggestion to help promote   in the state, Bengal Chamber of Commerce & Industry (BCCI) has prepared a website that offers a range of weekend spots. The destinations range from Telkupi in Purulia and Santalbari in Alipurduar to Malancha Rasulpur in Burdwan, Ichhe Gaon in Darjeeling, Gopegarh in West Midnapore and Monchasha in East Midnapore. While seleting the locations, uniqueness and ecological diversity have been the driving factor.
 
 The locales span all 20 districts, including   in Kolkata. Popular holiday locations like Darjeeling and Digha have not been included. Tariffs range from Rs 1,000 a day for a couple in spartan cottages to Rs 18,000 in palatial rajbaris.
 
 The website is distinctive as it brings a large number of lesser known places of the state to promote them as weekend destinations. The website not only fetches the places for the travellers but also gives detailed descriptions of the places and how to reach them with directions and Google Maps, as well as places to stay with contacts.
 
 Tourism minister Gautam Deb, who inaugurated the website www.bengalweekend.com, said it would come in handy for tourists, both from within the state and outside. “We are thankful to BCCI for the initiative,” he said.
 
 A BCCI official termed the website a labour of love that would never be complete since there were too many places to visit in the state. “We will continue to add new destinations and upgrade the site so that it remains relevant and useful to tourists,” the official added.
