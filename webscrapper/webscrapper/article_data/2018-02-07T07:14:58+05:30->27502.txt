MUMBAI: The railway ministry has sanctioned over Rs 779 crore for capacity augmentation projects under various   (MUTP) projects, besides giving approval for a long-distance train terminus at Parel as well as making generous allocation for foot overbridges and escalators.

 Though the budget was presented on February 1, details of the funds sanctioned for various works were made public on Tuesday.
 
 
  
 
 MUTP II and III has got an allocation of Rs 170 crore and Rs 519 crore. MUTP IIIA that had projects worth Rs 54,777 crore has also received a token allocation of Rs 1 crore.
 
 Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation’s (MRVC) acting chairman and managing director   said, “A matching amount will be released by the state government too for all the MUTP projects. A token allocation for MUTP IIIA has been made because the projects are yet to be approved by  , the state government and the union cabinet.”
 
 He said, “Execution of the project will depend on how soon the right of way for land is made available to us after clearing encroachments or utilities.”
 
 Following the   tragedy, railways has sanctioned a record number of foot overbridges. WR general manager AK Gupta said, “We will execute around 43 FOBs (excluding those constructed by MRVC). Also, of the 372 escalators sanctioned for Mumbai, WR will get around 100.”
 
 CR divisional railway manager SK Jain said, “We are going to install around 214 escalators in Mumbai, besides constructing 21 FOBs (excluding those constructed by MRVC).”
 
 Jain said, “There has always been talk of works not getting executed in time. However, this time around we have decided to float 17 tenders worth Rs 419 crore for various works in Mumbai division. We have also identified works worth Rs 500 crore for 17 more works.”
 
 The 138-year-old Parel  , one of the largest in the country with 7,000 employees, is likely to make way for a terminus for outstation trains.
