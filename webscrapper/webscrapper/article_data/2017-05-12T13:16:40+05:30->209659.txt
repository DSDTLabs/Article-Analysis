CHENNAI: As the   started trickling out today across  , mark details through   brought cheers among parents and students.

 Gone are the days when evening newspapers ran special editions and published the results at noon. Though results were published at the   at 10am, one had to wait for the special editions to merely give the registration number of candidates. Those who didn't find their numbers were left crestfallen, as it meant failure in the examination. There were also instances of newspapers missing out numbers by mistake or oversight, leading to suicide by the students concerned. That a direction would be carried the next day hardly mattered in such cases.
 
 It would be about a week's wait for marksheet to be distributed at the respective schools. Then, the directorate had its own portal and it also released a list of portals where parents and students could check their marks the same day. 
 
  
  This graduation to online mode too came with its own set of troubles, as it all depended on the bandwidth, data speed and connectivity issues. There were complaints of anxious students spending endless minute for the system to show mark details. It was so till last year. 
 
 This year, things are very different. Less than 10 minutes after the officials unveiled the results in Chennai, most of the parents received the marks details over their registered mobile numbers. 
 
 Besides being the most authentic alert, the SMS had a neat break up of marks in theory and practical, total score, name and other relevant details. 
 Getting to see all these details without any fuss was a pleasant experience for students and parents of Tamil Nadu.
