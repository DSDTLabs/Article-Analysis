BHUBANESWAR: The state commerce and transport department has asked the director general of police (DGP) and transport commissioner to ensure the removal of multi-tone horns from vehicles. 

 The department issued the directive on Friday and asked the authorities to refer to the   ruling banning the use of   and multi-tone horns within a 100m radius of schools, hospitals and residential and commercial areas. Using pressure horns is also an offence under section 190 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988.
 
 G Srinivas, commerce and transport secretary, said: "The department has also urged the DGP and transport commissioner to send an action taken report regarding this issue. It will be sent to the Union ministry of road transport and highways." 
 
 Even the Orissa Urban Police Act of 2003 does not allow owners or drivers of vehicles to install power or musical horns in their vehicles. "Those violating the rule will have to pay a fine of Rs 500. Inspectors and officials above their rank can impose the fine on violators," said a senior police officer. 
 
 Despite all these rules and regulations, many trucks, buses and other vehicles continue to use these horns. 
 
 "Some drivers are not ever aware of the law and have these horns fixed in their vehicles," said a transport officer. 
 
 C Pritam, an associate professor of the ENT department of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, said: "Exposure to excessive honking and sudden loud noise may lead to loss of hearing and psychological changes. 
 
 Constant exposure to noise affects the power to concentrate. If a person is exposed to loud noise over the years, s/he may face hearing loss slowly but surely."
