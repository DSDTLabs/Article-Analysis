Panaji: With the deficit rising to 11% from 7% due to the weakening of monsoon activity and no system to sustain the rainfall activity, the season’s peak month is likely to see more sunny days during most part of the last week. The seasonal total has touched 1,563.5mm on Monday, as against the normal of 1,765.8mm. “The rainfall will reduce and only light to moderate rainfall is likely during the next three days,” M L Sahu, director, meteorological centre, Altinho said. The offshore trough at mean sea level from south Gujarat coast to north Kerala coast has weakened by Sunday. But, when it persisted for quite some time and combined with another phenomenon of a depression over coastal Odisha, it yielded heavy to very heavy rainfall for a couple of days. The meteorological centre recorded a state average of 94.8mm till 8.30am on July 19 and 72mm on July 20. On July 14, a combined effect of a well-marked low pressure area over Madhya Pradesh and an offshore trough from Maharashtra to Kerala coast had yielded 102.3mm - the heaviest rainfall of the season. These were the two heaviest spells of the season while the deficit has persisted for most part of June and July, though it has been in a normal range within 19%.  During the last 24 hours, most places received moderate to light rainfall. Ponda recorded 30.0mm, Valpoi 29.4, Sanguem 29.0mm, Quepem 25.0mm, Mormugao 18.8mm, Panaji 14.1mm and others on a lesser scale.
