MUMBAI: State labour minister  's statement in Nanded during the campaign for the ensuing civic elections has caused a flutter in political circles.

 Nilangekar told an election rally in Nanded city that he is chief minister Devendra Fadnavis's most favourite minister. “He has entrusted me with the responsibility of the Nanded-Waghala civic polls,“ Nilangekar said.
 
 Nilangekar, the grandson of former chief minister Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar, successfully took on the   family in Latur district.
 
 In Latur, both zilla parishad and Latur Municipal Corporation were controlled by the Congress then led by Vilasrao Deshmukh. Ho wever after Deshmukh's demise, Nilangekar stepped in dislodged the Congress completely. In the recently held elections to the Latur zilla parishad and Latur Municipal Corporation, the BJP wrested the two institutions from the Congress.
 
 It remains to be seen if Nilangekar will be able to exert his influence in the Nanded-Waghala civic polls too. “Given the presen ce of state Congress chief Ashok Chavan, it will be difficult for the BJP, particularly Nilangekar, to win the corporation,“ said a senior Congress leader.
 
 Chavan survived the   wave and won the 2014 general election with a huge margin. He also managed to win subsequent polls and under such circumstances, it will not be a cakewalk for the BJP. “Modi had addressed two rallies in Nanded. Despite it, Chavan won,'' he said.
