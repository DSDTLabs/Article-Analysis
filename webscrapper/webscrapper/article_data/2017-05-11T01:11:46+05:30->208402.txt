  Ivana, who won her first gold at the Asian event in 2013, finished with seven points – five wins and four draws – to finish half a point ahead of Meghna (6.5 points), while Bidhar Rutumbara’s six points meant all three podium finishes were gobbled by India.
  
  She defeated the likes of Hotami (Tajikistan), Mandar (Syria), Fatemeh, Anousha and Mobina (all Iran) and drew four games against Alijanzabeh (Iran), Meghna, Rupimbera and Harshita (all India).
  
  Seeded second behind Woman Fide Master Alinasab Mobina of Iran, Ivana proved a cut above the rest for participants from five countries, all jostling for the under-20 title.

However, the second norm is yet to be confirmed and verified by Fide.
  
  Ivana (2132 ELO points) will need to reach 2400 points to become the second Goan Women's Grand Master after  .
