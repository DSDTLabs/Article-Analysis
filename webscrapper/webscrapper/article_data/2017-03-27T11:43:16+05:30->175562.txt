AHMEDABAD: The old generation of theatre-goers can still hum to ‘Hriday na Shuddh Premi ne..’ from the 1924 play  , based on Kanaiyalal Munshi’s Prithvivallabh and immortalized by Ashraf Khan’s acting. The same can be said about innumerable songs that were integral part of the narratives in old Gujarati theatre. The tradition, that almost vanished, is slowly making a comeback in a new form thanks to new experiments in Gujarati theatre.

 Theatre actor/director Raju Barot has been running ‘Tarz-e-Theatre’ since 1998 where participants play and sing theatre songs both from old and new eras to keep alive the rich cultural heritage. So far, there have been over 60 events under the banner at different places including colleges. 
 
 “Roots of old theatre in Gujarat can be found in performance forms such as Bhavai where songs were an integral part,” says Barot. “The old plays continued the tradition and at one point of time there used to be as many as 25 songs in some of the productions.”
 
 “But later, the form underwent much change and there were no actors who could sing as well,” says Barot.
 
 Nisarg Trivedi, theatre actor/director, points at directors such as Bharat Dave, Nimesh Desai, Mayank Oza and Madhu Patel for whom songs were inseparable from storytelling. “The late Chinu Modi was also a well-known exponent of the form and had a number of memorable plays with songs,” he says.
 
 Aditi Desai, director of recent musical,  , said that it was a conscious decision to add songs to the narrative as it were essential to show the life at sea. 
 
 “I and Devki (writer/actor of the play) were in the US when we visited the Broadway productions and were inspired to recreate the experience for Gujarati audience. We are happy about the response the play is getting,” she said.
