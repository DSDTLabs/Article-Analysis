GUWAHATI:   have cautioned   in the national capital against   

 This comes after recent complaints from several youths who went to join Delhi Police, as well as others from the region, who were hoodwinked into shelling out money for plots of land in Noida, Gurgaon, Solan, among other areas, at throwaway prices.
 
 Delhi Police have even prepared a 'wanted' list of such racketeers who have been involved in cheating. Sources said the racketeers were mostly locals married to northeastern women. Many foreigners, well-informed about the region, with bank accounts in Dimapur,  , Guwahati, Shilling and Itanagar, are also reportedly involved in the racket.
 
 A senior police official in Delhi, explaining the racketeers' modus operandi, said, "They scout for youths from the northeast who have newly joined in some jobs in Delhi through church services, community meetings, collect their mobile numbers and then approach them with promises for investment."
 
 The police official said the racketeers have even taken several people from the region living in the state on board, luring them of hefty payments. "After collecting the phone numbers, these groups sent bulk SMSs, proposing attractive deals for real estate properties in Delhi and NCR," he said.
 
 Delhi Police's special wing for NE people have recently issued an alert in connection with the racket. Already victims who were cheated have even formed association as victims of land fraud cases at Rajasthan and Noida. However, they have been reportedly running pillar-to-post to get back their hard-earned money.
 
 "In a recent case, a youth from Sikkim came to Delhi to work as cabin crew and another from Itanagar who joined police force lost huge sums of money when they were trying to buy land plots in Delhi. We are alerting everyone to verify all papers, plan, clearance, registration, land records before making any such deal or to alert police before such dealings," the official added.
