Author  , who was in the city last week for the Power Talk series at  , addressed students on how to be successful in life. However, what impressed students was the ease with which he conducted his session and answered all the questions that students put forth. Laced with pun and humour,   even answered a student, who asked the author whether he had got his Aadhar card linked yet? “Yes. I finally did it. It was a nightmare to do it, but I have done so,” said Chetan.

 But the tricky questions didn’t stop there. Another student asked, “What would you choose — love, fame or money?” To which Chetan answered, “It’s a trick question. It’s different for individuals. I would place fame at the third place. Now, if you don’t have money, you won’t have love. So, a little money then love and then I would choose fame.”
 The author also cleared the air about his acting aspirations and said, “I cannot act. What would I act as? I cannot be anybody else. I would love to be on TV as myself, but that’s it.” As a parting note, Chetan announced that his next book would be out in October this year, giving his fans reason to cheer.
