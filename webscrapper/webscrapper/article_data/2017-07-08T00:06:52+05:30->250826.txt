MUMBAI: Seven months after the state government lifted its stay on the BMC’s pay and park  , the civic body has begun the process of floating tenders for the 91 on-street pay and park lots which are to be operated across the city.

 At the 91 spots, citizens would be expected to pay revised parking rates from, say, Rs 20 an hour in Ghatkopar to Rs 60 in Colaba. Civic officials said 45 of the total 91 spots would be given to Mahila Bachat Gad to operate. Some of the 45 spots include parking islands opposite Eros Cinema, Horniman Circle, Veer Nariman Road in Fort and Maharshi Karve Marg from Eros Cinema Junction to Madam Cama Road in Fort again. Meanwhile, the   will float tenders for 23 other   in New Prabhadevi Road and N S Road that are to be given to educated unemployed persons,” said a senior official.
 
 Over a dozen lots in Fort, part of the 91 spots, have already begun to collect the revised rates. “However, once the tendering process is complete, new contractors would be brought in,” said an official.
 
 On February 10, TOI was the first to report that the state had lifted its stay on the controversial pay and park policy. The move came just a week before the civic election code of conduct kicked in on January 11, 2017. It The policy was announced on January 2, 2015, after it was passed by Shiv Sena-BJP-dominated BMC general body. A few days later, it was put on hold by the chief minister after south Mumbai residents, who were to be affected the most by the differential rates —around Rs 2,000 a month for night parking in A ward (Colaba-Churchgate)—raised a stink. On the delay in floating tenders, officials said after the stay was lifted, the civic election code of conduct kicked in. “In two months, the lots can be operated as per revised rates, provided we get adequate response to tenders floated.”
