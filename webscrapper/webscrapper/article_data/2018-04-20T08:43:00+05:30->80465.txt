NEW DELHI: Selectors should not be held accountable to the public for the decisions they make in selection committee meetings if and when the   ( ) comes under the ambit of the RTI Act, feels the Committee of Administrator ( ) running cricketing affairs. There are fears within the board that coming under the RTI Act may interfere with the independent judgement and discretion of selectors who pick the respective teams.

 
 The CoA isn’t averse to the idea of the BCCI coming under the RTI ambit but feels there should be some control over what information is made available to the public. “Selection meetings are not minuted and there are no records of who said what in the meetings,” a source close to CoA said.
 
 The example of former foreign secretary   is being discussed in BCCI boardrooms. When Menon was promoted to foreign secretary after superseding 16 IFS officers, it triggered a revolt and the matter was taken up by the Supreme Court, which ruled that it was the government’s discretion to pick its secretary.
 
 When CoA chief   was the chairman of the Banks Boards Bureau, he was responsible for selecting CEOs and recommending the selections of chiefs of government-owned banks and financial institutions. “During his tenure, no RTI was filed and the public knew the process that helped to build trust,” he said.
 
 Although some of the board members have expressed reservations over public money in BCCI being cited as a reason for bringing it under the RTI ambit, sources close to the CoA said, “The corporates can’t be under RTI because it’s private money. When BCCI has been given tax benefits, lands at cheaper rates and other benefits from the government, why can’t it be answerable to the public?”
