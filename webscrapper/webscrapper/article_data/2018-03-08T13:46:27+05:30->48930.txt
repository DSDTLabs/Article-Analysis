DHARAMSHALA: A ‘Thank You, India’ event will mark 60 years of Tibetans in exile in India, but government functionaries and politicial leaders are expected to stay away from celebrations due to the crucial juncture at which ties between India and China are at present.

 Leaders and government dignitaries are treading cautiously when it has come to the event. The Tibetan government in exile’s administration had approached BJP MP Anurag Thakur, who heads Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association, for giving the international cricket stadium in   as a venue for the event, but even has been tight-lipped.
 
 Thakur confirmed that Tibetans had approached him, but said there was no decision yet. “It is up to the board of directors to give an approval for the venue. Such decisions are not taken by me,” he said.
 
 Except for the cricket stadium and police grounds, there is no large venue in Dharamshala. 
 
 The event is scheduled for March 31, and a similar function will be held in Delhi. The main event was shifted to Dharamshala after the Centre’s “distant attitude”.  , the spokesperson of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), said India-China relations wqere good for resolving the Tibetan issue and this development would not have any negative impact.
 
 Tibetan activists are all set to hold demonstrations in Delhi ahead of the 59th anniversary of Tibetan Uprising Day and 10th anniversary of 2008 mass protests. Events planned include a peace march from   to Dharamshala police ground on March 10, then screening of documentary films on the 2008 Uprising on March 11, a public talk on March 13, and a mass peace march from   to Jantar Mantar in Delhi on March 14.
 
 Tenzin Jigme, president of Tibetan Youth Congress, said he was in Varanasi for a conference and the scheduled was fixed for Uprising Day. “It has not been changed. The events will be held as per plan” he said.
