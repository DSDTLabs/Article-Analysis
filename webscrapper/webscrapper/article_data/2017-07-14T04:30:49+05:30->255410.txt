NEW DELHI: BJP president   will be in Delhi for the next two days as part of his 110-day-long nation-wide tour under the party's "expansion campaign" and consultations in the party could finalise the name of its vice-presidential candidate. 

 As part of his engagements, Shah will have a series of meetings with the Delhi unit's core group and office-bearers at the NDMC Convention Centre on Friday and will visit the state office the next day.
 
 However, his stay in the Capital coincides with the party's discussions to zero in on the NDA's vice-presidential candidate with the opposition having nominated former West Bengal governor  . 
 
 The BJP president is understood to have held deliberations with RSS functionaries Bhaiyyaji Joshi and Krishna Gopal on a range of issues, which could have included possible NDA nominees for the vice-presidential poll slated for August 5. 
 
 Party sources claimed a BJP person with legislative experience was likely to be the NDA candidate as it is felt the incumbent will need to manage Rajya Sabha where the opposition will retain healthy numbers almost till the next Lok Sabha elections in 2019. So far, it seems no member of the cabinet is going to be considered and with presidential nominee   hailing from UP, the choice for vice-president could be from a different region. 
 
 The party is confident about a victory given its combined numbers in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha that constitute the electoral college. Kovind, as per party estimates, is heading for a big win. He has received support of non-NDA regional parties including BJD, JD(U), TRS, YSR Congress, INLD and the two factions of AIADMK. Although, state legislators are not part of the electoral college for the vice-presidential poll, most regional parties supporting Kovind have MPs and their support for the NDAâ€™s vice-presidential candidate will add to the numbers.
