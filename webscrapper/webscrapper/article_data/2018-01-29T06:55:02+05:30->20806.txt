 According to Dr  , chief health officer (clinical), BBMP, it was a normal delivery. "There is no medical negligence. On the third day, the baby developed jaundice and was referred to another hospital. From there, she was referred to another hospital as her condition was aggravating fast. After getting treated there for 24 hours, the child succumbed. It was a case of congenital haemolytic anaemia. Normally, cases of jaundice don't aggravate so fast," she said.
 
  police said  , mother of baby, and her relatives alleged that the child died due to negligence in treatment at the BBMP hospital. Later, the officials concerned convinced them that there was no negligence. "We have not registered any negligence case against the BBMP hospital or its doctor," police said.
