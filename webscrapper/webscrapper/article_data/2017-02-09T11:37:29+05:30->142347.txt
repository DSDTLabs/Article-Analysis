INDORE: Staging protest against   allotted by   Board of Secondary Education (MPBSE), members of the   handed over a memorandum to the district   on Wednesday. 

 The party members claimed that many students got the exam centres as far as 20-25 km which would be inconvenient for them and it will also support impersonators to give examination on behalf of the students. 
 
 They also said that this is the first phase of their protest and they will be taking this campaign forward in four phases. “After submitting the memorandum to DEO we will be going to CEO Zila Panchayat, MPBSE city office and collector office to stage protest against the education mafia running in the city and all across MP,” said Congress party member Rohit Dhanote.
 
  “Students from Indore city have been allotted exam centres 20-25 km away from the city while students of nearby villages have been allotted exam centres in the city which is unfair. This will increase the chances of cheating amongst the students. At least all the centres should have CCTVs so that such things do not happen this is our main demand,” added Dhanote. 
 
 The memorandum stated that education mafia helps students to cheat during the examination easily and charge money from them accordingly. They claimed that students who do not attend school regularly have also been allowed to give the exams while the rule says that 75% attendance is compulsory for regular candidates. 
 
 The district education officer has assured the party workers that no such discrepancies would occur during exam.
