AHMEDABAD: Naeem Ramodia, accused of planning an ISIS-inspired lone wolf attack in Gujarat, withdrew his bail application from Gujarat high court on Monday after the judges seemed disinclined to release him on bail.

 Naeem and his elder brother Wasim were arrested by Gujarat ATS in February last year on charges of planning attacks on Chotila temple, Ahmedabad’s synagogue and at other places in the state against ‘kafirs’. The probe was handed over to the   (NIA), which filed a chargesheet stating that their handler in   was one Mufti Abdus Sami Qasmi alias Samiullah.
 
 Ramodia’s advocates submitted that according to facts mentioned in the NIA chargesheet, Ramodia brothers were misguided youths, and for communication on internet, people could not have been charged for terrorism. The accused should have been sent for reform instead, because it was beyond their capacity to execute the plans.
 
 The Centre’s counsel submitted before the court that the offence alleged in this case is grave in nature and punishable with five years to life imprisonment. Most nations have acknowledged ISIS as a terror outfit. The accused person is educated and the story that he was misguided cannot be believed at this stage.
