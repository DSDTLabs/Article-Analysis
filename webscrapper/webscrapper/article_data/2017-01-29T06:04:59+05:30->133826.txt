LUCKNOW: Stung by criticism over visitors having to take off   before entering her house, BSP chief   said on Saturday that this rule was in place since her house was a temple. “Yeh jo mera ghar hai wo ek   ki tarah hai...,” said Mayawati, adding that though she wore a sandal inside the house, it was different from the one she used outside. “Mere paas andar aur bahar ke liye alag alag sandals hain....,” she said.

 “It is like taking off footwear before entering a place of worship,” said Mayawati, two days after photographs of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s family standing barefoot with her at the time of joining the BSP went viral. “My house has murals of Dalit icons who are worshipped...it also has a memorial of Manyawar Kanshiram,” said Mayawati, even as she ordered a door to be opened. “Can you see murals of Dalit icons inside,” she asked to a group of media persons at her house. 
 
 In all her previous press conferences convened at her house, the door to a hallowed hall is closed once Mayawati comes out and speaks to the media. Nobody other than Maywati uses that hall. But on Januray 26, Mayawati allowed not only her deputies S C Mishra and Naseemuddin Siddiqui but also the Ansari brothers to walk through the hall, though barefoot.
 
 The BSP chief said all such issues were blown up to malign her image. “I urge the media not to do so...,” said Mayawati, adding, “Kuch channels aur akhbaar waalon ne apne number badhwa liye...par wo meri nazar mein gir gaye (some TV channels and newspapers achieved higher numbers with this news but they fell in my eyes),” she said.
 
 Even during her previous stint as UP chief minister, Mayawati, had faced allegations of asking state administration officials to take off their   before entering her office. Recently, chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, while taking a jibe at Mayawati had asked some of the officials to recall the time they were asked to take off their shoes before entering CM’s office.
