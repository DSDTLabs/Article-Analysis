VISAKHAPATNAM: Despite being one of the major drinking water sources of the   (GVMC),   is far from being clean. The   too needs a facelift.

 TOI visited the reservoir to check the present condition on Tuesday and found cattle swimming in the reservoir while four security men tried their level best to chase them away. There were also plastic bottles, liquor bottles and other waste floating in the water and polluting it.
 
 Some of the residents who visit the Mudasarlova Park for morning walks and recreation said the concerned authorities must clean the reservoir as the waste helps disease-causing organisms to grow in the water and cause health problems for aquatic animals and humans who drink that water.
 
 Dr K Ram Kumar, managing director of   in Akkayyapalem, said “The park and the reservoir is poorly maintained. Cattle swim in the reservoir and some people drink alcohol in the vicinity. All these create an unhealthy environment and contaminate the water which we drink in the city.”
 
 “Some people take advantage of the reservoir not having a compound wall on the one side and sneak in to give a bath to the cattle. The owners should be warned by the concerned officials to stop this practice,” a security man at the reservoir said.
 
 TOI also found a group of college students having a liquor party along the reservoir. A student from Kottavalasa said, “We come to the park frequently and go back after having lunch here with friends.”
 
 A security man said, “We try to stop the unfair activities in the area, but these youngsters refuse to listen to us. The practice continues as the park is in an isolated place far away from the city and the entry fee is just Rs 3 per adult.”
