Last year, cases of a Bengaluru woman killing eight 15-day-old puppies, police horse Shaktiman being mercilessly hit by an MLA in Dehradun and a medical student throwing a dog off a terrace in Chennai all made news. That brought to light the meagre Rs50 fine for animal cruelty, after which the hashtag #NoMore50 started doing the rounds. A year on, there is a video being circulated of a middle-aged man in Tamil Nadu beating a dog on a leash to death with a wooden stick, ignoring the cries of the distressed animal. What is more horrifying is that two children egg him on to do so in the video. This brings the role of the law back into focus — why is it that an animal’s life is only worth Rs50? And why haven’t our MPs ensured that the Animal Welfare Bill 2014 has been passed in Parliament?
“The bill was tabled in parliament in 2011, amended in 2014 and awaits passing. It’s just a matter of having the will to pass it. How long does that take? No one can be against the increasing of fine from `50, so there is no question of any opposition to getting a bill that will save thousands of animals being abused passed. I am not saying that cases of cruelty will immediately drop — it will take perhaps five years before any effect of the law can be seen, but it’s about time we did something. What is frightening about the latest case is that children were egging the man on. What have we bred? It chills me to the marrow,” says animal activist  .
 The Indian constitution mandates kindness and compassion for animals, but, unfortunately, the judiciary is out of sync with the constitution since it is not enforced by law. While increasing the penalty is the most obvious need,   of the   (AWBI) says that in the meantime, there needs to be other measures to deter cruelty.
 “Our laws are not strict and the fines are horrible. An FIR was lodged against the lady who killed the eight puppies, but she paid `50 and got out. Just imagine that. The law can’t change overnight, but other steps can be taken. For example, the medical student who threw a dog off the terrace was suspended for some time. Similarly, if a person has shown cruelty towards an animal, he/she should be fired from their jobs. This way people will know that there are consequences to their actions. Of course for this, we require additional involvement of people,” he says, adding that animal lovers also need to do more than just throwing biscuits at stray dogs on the roads. “Get involved when there is an issue. Start posting about animal laws and create awareness, because there are many people who don’t even know that there are animal laws. Dogs are being thrown from the 4th floor, they are being burnt and beaten to death. What more is required to shake people up? Thanks to the law, everyone takes these things lightly and nobody is afraid,” says Anurag. 
 
 The Animal Welfare Bill, 2014
 Under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, an offender is fined Rs50 for the first offence and Rs100 for subsequent ones. To address the lacunae in the Indian laws, the AWBI drew a fresh draft — the Animal Welfare Bill, 2014, which is yet to be passed in Parliament. These are some of the reforms in the bill:
 - The draft bill seeks a ban on all entertainment sports and events that psychologically and physically harm animals
 - The bill also has detailed rules and regulations for the breeding and sale of animals, experimentations on animals and the rights of performing animals
 - According to the bill, anyone seen beating, inflicting pain, mutilating, torturing, abandoning, neglecting or even confining any animal, in the first such offence, may be imprisoned for up to two years, and/or fined an amount not less than Rs10,000 and up to Rs 5 lakh. In the case of a second or subsequent offence, the fine may vary from Rs 75,000 to Rs 10 lakh, and prison terms from one year to three years
