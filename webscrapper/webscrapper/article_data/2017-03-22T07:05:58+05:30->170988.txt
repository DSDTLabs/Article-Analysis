PUNE: Social organisations have called a bandh in Mahabaleshwar on Wednesday in protest against ‘renaming’ of a civic parking lot 

 The Mahabaleshwar municipal council on Tuesday decided to name the parking lot after  , which is being opposed by some organizations claiming that it has already been named after  .
 
 The parking lot was named after Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj by Satara MP   before the recent council elections. The move was supported by social organisations and admirers of Sambhaji Maharaj. However, the municipal council’s general body on Tuesday passed a resolution to name it after Babasaheb Ambedkar, claiming that the civic body had not officially named the parking lot. The general body held a vote on the issue in which members voted in its favour.
 
 Soon after the members of social organizations came to know about the proposed change in the name, they approached the civic body with an appeal to avoid any such move as the issue was sentimental. They also warned that they would resort to an agitation if the civic body goes ahead with its plan.
 
 In the meantime, the police department has beefed up security across the hill station in view of the bandh call.
