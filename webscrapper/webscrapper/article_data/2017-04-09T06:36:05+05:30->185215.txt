HYDERABAD: The state government's ' ' and ' ' schemes are a boon to the poor, but netas are extracting political mileage through mass distribution of cheques. Under the scheme, a cheque of Rs 51,000 is handed over to a bride from economically backward Hindu or Muslim family. 

 Earlier, officials would give away cheques, but this is now being done by MLAs. What happened at   in neighbouring   district on Saturday is an example of how not only beneficiaries are cheering, but also politicians are turning it into a fertile turf for electoral politics.
 
 At a programme organized at a palace at Chinthal, public representatives of TRS went the extra mile to please beneficiaries. Over 236 beneficiaries were given away cheques and even lunch was arranged for families - for a total of 1,500 people. Also, there was an assortment of cuisine, including chicken curry and vegetarian dishes.
 
 "We gave away cheques of Rs 2.47 crore. For an electoral connect with beneficiaries, public representatives had lunch with them," said Qutbullapur MLA K P Vivekanand. Deputy CM Mahmood Ali, Malkajgiri MP Malla Reddy, mayor Bonthu Rammohan, MLC Shambhipur Raju were among the public representatives present. 
 
 With more changes suggested by chief minister   in distribution of cheques to beneficiaries, public representatives would also soon be required to attend weddings and hand over cheques at the time of the wedding.
