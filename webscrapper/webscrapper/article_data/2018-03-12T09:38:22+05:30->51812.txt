ERODE: Makkal Needhi Maiam founder   on Sunday urged the youths to take up agriculture. “Fertile lands are now looking for youth power. Instead of concentrating only on engineering and medicine, they should also learn about the latest technologies in agriculture,” he said.
 
 Before wrapping up his two-day visit to Erode, Kamal attended meetings in Modakkuruchi, Veerappanchatram, Chithode and   areas in the district on Sunday. He also addressed a massive gathering at Gobichettipalayam.
 
 Pointing out that Gobichettipalayam was known for its weaving industry, the actor-turned-politician lamented that the show was mostly run by the elderly people. “After their period, how would the weaving industry at Gobichettipalayam survive,” he asked.
 
 Referring to total prohibition in the state, he said it couldn’t be done in a single day. “People should be ready to give it up. Only then total prohibition is possible. Forced prohibition, by and large, only see people get addicted to some other bad habits,” Kamal said.
 
 From Gobichettipalayam, he left for Sathyamangalam where thousands of people gave him a rousing welcome. Addressing the gathering, Kamal said it was the government’s duty to keep   clean and protect it from being polluted by effluents discharged by dyeing units. “If the government fails in this front, we will see what we can do about it,” he said.
 
 Kamal also visited Andhiyur, where he hoisted the party flags. Hearing about the bad state of Bhavani River, he wanted to see it in person. After visiting the river, he left for Erode to attend a private function.
