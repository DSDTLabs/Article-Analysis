CALANGUTE: Rental   that have been abandoned by their owners in   will soon be impounded by the village panchayat.

  The authorities found that when the vehicles are no longer road-worthy, they are abandoned in public places, creating problems for parking and pedestrian movement. In March, the panchayat had published a public notice urging the owners concerned to remove their vehicles within 15 days. 
 
 
 Although many vehicles were removed, a recent survey found that 80 still lay abandoned at some spots.
