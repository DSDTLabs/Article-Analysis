NEW DELHI: Getting licences for musical programmes at public places, serving   temporarily, holding events at guesthouses etc is easier now. Delhi   has launched an   registration system on its website where applicants can fill verification forms and get the permission within 20 hours. Till now, an applicant had to spend the whole day at the   office for it.

 The system, launched by police commissioner   on Friday, has been designed, developed and implemented internally by   after consultations with all stakeholders and IT professionals. “Earlier, a person seeking a casual performance licence had to download a form and approach the office of the additional CP (licensing), who scrutinised the application, waited for the police to conduct a manual verification and granted the licence after 2-3 days. The idea is to make the process easier and accessible to applicants at home. The status can also be checked online,” said Delhi Police chief spokesperson Dependra Pathak. Senior officers said that there plans are to make online other licensing processes as well.
 
 The police receive more than 5,000 requests for licences during winter when more of such programmes are held in the city. Once a person applies for a licence, the licensing department forwards the application to the district concerned and to the area police station. The beat officer then visits the place for verification. The information from the beat officer is processed by the department, following which the permission is given.
 
 The system links all the 13 districts and six traffic ranges of Delhi Police with the licensing unit. It will do away with any physical interface between the applicant and the police, reducing corruption.
