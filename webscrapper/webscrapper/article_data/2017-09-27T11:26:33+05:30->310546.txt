PATIALA: Upping up their ante against the   government on the last day of their five-day protest, farmers on Tuesday demanded a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal of paddy. The protesters said in case the state failed to address their concerns, they would be forced to burn paddy stubble post harvesting season. 

 Following paddy harvesting, the arrival of its produce has already begun in the grain markets while the official procurement of the produce will begin from October 1.
 
 The farmers on Tuesday challenged the state government’s ban on stubble burning and also set ablaze a heap of stubble at the protest site in Mehamudpur village on   road, about 15 km from here. During their five-day protest, the farmers have been demanding a complete loan waiver, increase in   of crops and ban on kurki besides raising the demand of a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal on paddy stubble. 
 
 “We want a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal of paddy stubble as we don’t want to pollute the environment but since the government is not listening to us, we have no other option but to burn the straw. We are ready to counter any official. We know we will be booked and arrested by the police. We are ready to fill jails. The government had failed to fulfil its poll promises made in the manifesto. It’s now farmers’ battle against the government over rights. On an acre, around 30 quintals of paddy stubble is left and farmers have to incur their own expenditure to remove it without government’s help.” 
 
 As the farmer organisations were restricted from entering Patiala, a 20-km protest march was held by the farmers from Mehamudpur to Bhiwanigarh villages on tractor trolleys and other vehicles.
 
 Meanwhile, seven farmer unions, including BKU (Ekta Ugarahan), BKU (Dakaunda), Kirti Kisan Union, Krantikari Kisan Union, BKU (Krantikari),   (Azad), and Kisan Sangharsh Committee (Pannu), have decided to announce the next course of action on October 27, following the end of harvest season.
