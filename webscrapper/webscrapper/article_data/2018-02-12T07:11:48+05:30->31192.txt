KOCHI: The   in which a   and stuffed into a   seems to have hit a roadblock. The police team that went to Mumbai to gather information about a woman, who they suspected to be the victim, returned to Kochi on Friday without any major clues.

 The team went to Mumbai after information that an Udayamperoor native is the only missing woman who had a malleolar screw just like the one found from the unidentified body. The woman is believed to have gone to Mumbai over a year ago. She had met with a twowheeler accident just a few months ago before she went incommunicado.
 
 “A team lead by assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Rajan Pillai of Panangad police station tried to locate the woman in Mumbai, but failed. The efforts to identify the deceased woman is progressing,” said Siby Tom, south circle inspector.
 
 The police said the team camped in Mumbai for a couple of weeks but the investigation based on an address where the woman was likely to be located received no useful leads.
 
 “We were there to look into a couple of cases. Another absconding accused was nabbed during our tour,” said Pillai.
 
 The skeleton, believed to be more than a year old, was found after the police smashed open the barrel following complaints from the public of stench emanating from it on January 8.
