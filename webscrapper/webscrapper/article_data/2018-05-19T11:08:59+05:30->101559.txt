CHANDIGARH: As suspended police inspector   continued to elude Haryana vigilance bureau, a Hisar court on Thursday dismissed an anticipatory bail plea moved by her counsel. The court refused to grant Bala relief as the vigilance bureau said she was the brains behind the alleged honey-trap racket it busted in April.

 The court dismiss her bail a day after a team of the bureau, headed by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Shareef Singh, arrested Vinita, a resident of Hisar who had allegedly moved a complaint against Rajesh Kumar, a victim of the honey-trap gang. 
 
 Vinita was remanded to judicial custody on Thursday. Two other members of the gang, Anita of Housing Board Colony in Hisar and Mahinder Singh of Uklana, are also on the run. Vigilance teams are conducting raids to arrest them. “In the bail plea, Bala’s defence counsel said his client has been wrongly indicted in the case and she has no role to play in it. We informed the court about the evidence we have against her and why she’s the main accused,” said DSP Shareef, who is heading the investigating team.
 
 He said Anita was the brain behind the honey-trap racket. “She would send women to vulnerable men and then blackmail them. Vinita had lodged a lot of complaints against men under different identities. She would first lodge a complaint and then her gang would reach a compromise in lieu of money,” said the DSP.
 
 Referring to Bala, Shareef said after taking the complaint from Vinita, the woman inspector did not make an entry in any register of the police station, which showed her involvement in the racket.
 
 Last month, vigilance bureau had arrested Surender Singh, driver of Bala, and Yogesh Kumar, manager of a hotel, while accepting an amount of Rs 70,000 from one Rajesh Kumar for settling a complaint allegedly moved by Vinita. Bala has gone into hiding since then. On Wednesday, Hisar superintendent of police (SP) had placed her under suspension.
