HYDERABAD: Days after five pregnant women died at   and   rocked the hospital, the   finally woke up and began a  .

 Hyderabad collector Rahul Bojja, who was appointed as inquiry officer, rushed to the hospital on Wednesday amid tight security.
 
 Bojja interacted with hospital superintendent Dr C Suresh Kumar and other doctors. “The doctors revealed that all the five cases landed at Niloufer for delivery at the last stage. The five pregnant women were referred to Niloufer Hospital,” hospital sources told TOI. As the condition of the patients deteriorated due to excessive bleeding, they were admitted in the last minute, doctors told the collector. On day one of the probe, the collector asked hospital authorities to submit details of each case history and doctors who were on duty. Speaking to the media, Bojja said a three-member committee had been constituted to assist him. Following the high-level probe, its operation theatres (OTs) will continue to remain closed for C-section deliveries. 
 
 “It may take 3-4 days for the OTs to open and till then, C-section cases will be referred to GMH, Petlaburj,” said Dr C Suresh. Meanwhile, it is being suspected that the deaths could have been caused by contaminated blood.
 
 “Transfusion with contaminated blood can result in lung injuries (TRALI), anaphylaxis (a serious allergic reaction) and acute kidney failure,” said a retired doctor.
 
 Also, Anusha and Nusrath Begum had been administered 30 and 15 units of blood respectively after they were procured from private blood banks. “Administering 30 units of blood to one patient in a small window of 12 to 24 hours raises deep concerns over the quality of blood that was supplied to the patient and this needs to be probed thoroughly,” said Mujtaba Hasan Askari, founder of Helping Hand Foundation.
