NASHIK: Closure of   shops, permit rooms and other licenced shops within 500 metres of   in the district has severely hit the industry and close to 15,000 people are likely to lose their  . 

 After the   judgment, the excise department directed the liquor shops, bars and permit rooms within 500 metre from the highways to close down operations with effect from April 1. According to sources, 791 of total 1,111 liquor shops have stopped their operations in the district. 
 
 Sanjay Patil, president of Nashik Liquor Merchants Association, said, “As many as 791 liquor shops, permit rooms and bars have become non-operational from April 1 after the Supreme Court judgement and state government’s directives. The industry’s survival is at stake as 80% of the shops and permit rooms have been badly affected.” 
 
 He added, “Of 791, around 550 are permit rooms and bars have on an average 20-22 people working in two shifts. Moreover, there are also many people working in liquor shops, country liquor shops and beer shops. Close to 15,000 people from these 791 licenced shops will now lose their jobs. The government needs to find a solution.”
 
 An owner of liquor shop along the highway in the city said there are eight persons working with him and their salaries are in the range from Rs 9,000 to Rs 20,000. “I have still not removed them and will give them salaries for this month. But I will not be in any position to help them from next month. We are still positive that the government will take a decision to denotify the highways in the limit of municipal corporations in the state,” he said. 
 
 Excise minister Chandrashekhar Bawankule told the Assembly on Saturday that according to a June 9, 2001 notification, the state had decided that local bodies which had a bypass for diversion of heavy traffic could seek denotification of highways. These roads would then have to be maintained by these bodies. 
 
 “Using this notification, if many local bodies and municipal corporations want to denotify some stretches, this rule (of not having liquor vends within 500m) will not be applicable on those stretches,” the minister said on a day most hotels and restaurants along state and national highways in Pune, including the   highway (a major hub of permit rooms, lounges and bars), had stopped serving liquor.
 
 Bawankule said, “If licence holders find an alternative spot beyond the 500m limit, they will be allowed to shift their licences without any fresh charges.”
 
 An excise department official also said establishments that wish to shift their premises outside the radius mandated by SC can do so free of cost upon applying to the excise department.
 
 The state government earns a large chunk of its revenue through the renewal of licences. Non-renewal of licenses of liquor shops, permit rooms, bars and others have caused a loss of Rs 60 crore in the district by March 31. Annual fees for renewal of licences for wine shops is Rs 9.5 lakh per year, Rs 2.5 lakh for beer shop, Rs 3 lakh for country liquor shop and Rs 3.40 lakh for permit rooms. 
 
 The district had recorded sale of 84.89 lakh litres of the Indian-made foreign liquor with 11% rise during the financial year 2015-16, against 76.03 lakh litres in 2014-15. The sale of country liquor was recorded at 1.84 crore litres in 2015-16, against 1.86 crore litres in 2014-15. The district had recorded sale of 1.24 crore litres of beer during the financial year 2015-16, against sale of 1.19 crore litres during previous financial year 2014-15.
