 says he is influenced by American filmmakers, and staying true to this, his debut film, Shuddhi, is trying something different. Taking a leaf out of the 2000   film Traffic,   has 7-8 colour tones throughout the film, each depicting a different story. 

 Telling us about this, Adarsh says, “When you watch the movie, you will see the obvious differences in the colour tones.   and Sidhartha Maadhyamika’s portions have blue tones; Lauren Spartano’s bits are de-saturated, while Niveditha and Amrutha Karagada’s parts are in warm tones. Each depict different moods of the story.”
 
 
  
 The film promises to give new experiences to   audiences, and another way it is doing this is through certain technical aspects. Adarsh explains, “There is a 4.16 minute-long scene in the film which has been shot without any cuts. We covered an area of about 300 meters for this shot, which has people running in it. It was one, clean, non-stop shot, which has been retained as is in the film. Apart from this, 70% of the film has been shot with a handheld camera, which is a rarity in Indian films. Only Shashank’s and Sidhartha’s portions were shot with tripods; (DOP)   has shot the rest of the film with a camera placed on his shoulder.”
