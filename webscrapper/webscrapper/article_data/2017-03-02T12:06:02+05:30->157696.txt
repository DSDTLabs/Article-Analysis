KEONJHAR: Following an uproar at the assembly on the distress sale of tomatoes by farmers in the   district on Tuesday, the district collector on Wednesday visited the Mahadeijoda area in the Sadar block and held a discussion with farmers about their problems. 

 Keonjhar collector Dr N Thirumala Nayak said he will take the necessary steps that would ensure the sale of tomatoes at higher prices. "Steps are being taken to sell the tomatoes at the state capital, as some traders have agreed to procure tomatoes from here. We are also taking steps to supply tomatoes to about 40 schools run by ST/SC department," said Nayak.
 
 "We are also going to provide training on how to prepare sauce from tomatoes through the horticulture department, so that they can be preserved," the collector added. More than 100 trays of tomatoes, weighing about 25 to 30 kilograms per tray, are produced in the area daily. Farmers have not been able to sell tomatoes due to lack of market, nor have they been able to store them due to lack of cold storage facilities. Under constant stress to repay the loans that they had taken from different banks and SHG groups, on Sunday they staged a protest at Keonjhar.
