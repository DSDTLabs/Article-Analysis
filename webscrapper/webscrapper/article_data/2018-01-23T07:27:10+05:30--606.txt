CHANDIGARH: Of the 100 students of GMCH-32 who appeared in the final-year MBBS (professional)   this year, 19 failed in medicine and 14 in surgery.

  declared results of the class, the first 100-student batch at GMCH-32, on Monday. “I will have to look at the results and understand what all is lacking. It can be related to infrastructure or teaching,” said Dr BS  , director principal of   and Hospital, Sector 32 (GMCH-32).
 
 
 Sources said more 22 students had failed in the two subjects, but some of them were given 8 to 10 grace marks. “The university is authorized to give five grace marks and not more than that. We have heard four students whose parents are well connected have been granted marks and have passed,” claimed an MBBS student of the college.
 
 The final-year is the first batch at GMCH-32 to have 100 students. Earlier, the MBBS intake at the college was 50. Last year, the highest number of students who had failed in a subject was seven. “What kind of doctors should we expect them to become if they have flunked in the final year?” said a teacher at GMCH-32. “The college increased its intake and compromised on merit. We expected the results to be poor,” said the teacher.
