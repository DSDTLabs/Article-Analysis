GURUGRAM: For quite some time now,   on a key stretch in   — from   to Delhi border — have not been working. Residents of around half-a-dozen townships in New Palam Vihar say the absence of lights have led to increased incidents of thefts in the area.

 Being one of the prominent roads in New Palam Vihar that links Gurgaon to Delhi, the 8km stretch is used by local residents every day. But despite repeated complaints, residents allege, neither the power discom nor the MCG has fixed the dysfunctional streetslights in the area.
 
 “This is the main road. If we are going to Delhi or Gurgaon, we are supposed to take this very route,” said Yashish Yadav, a resident of Mahindra Aura housing society in New Palam Vihar. “Entire traffic heading towards   uses this route as well. And upon returning by the night time, the road wears a deserted look,” he added.
 
 Residents said they had led a delegation to the power discom’s sub-divisional office of New Palam Vihar to get the lights installed. 
 
 “Initially officials told us that the streetlights were not under their jurisdiction,” said Neha Dixit, another resident from   housing society. “But later they agreed to fix the lights, but we are still waiting because nothing has been done so far,” she added.
 
 Some residents said they will submit a joint protest letter to MCG office for its alleged apathetic attitude. 
 
 “We are writing a letter to MCG and will also visit their office. We have been visiting one office after another and everyone is telling us that it’s not under their jurisdiction. So who is going to fix the streetlights for us?” said another resident.
 
 Despite repeated attempts, neither discom officials nor the MCG executive engineer could be contacted.
