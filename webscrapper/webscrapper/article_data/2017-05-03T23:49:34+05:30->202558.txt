Hyderabad: US-based product design and engineering services provider GlobalLogic, that has offices in India including three in Hyderabad, is looking at snapping up companies in the area of cloud and artificial intelligence,   India managing director Sumit Sood said. GlobalLogic has acquired seven companies since its inception.

 “We have not made a single acquisition for revenues. It has been to acquire skills or expand/enter markets. Cloud is a big area as we have a lot of work with clients, right from helping them build cloud platforms to helping a lot of products become cloud compliant … we are very aggressively looking at that space. Artificial intelligence and machine learning too are a big part..,” Sood said. 
 
 In the area of cloud, he said the amount of work that needs to be done globally is massive as there is demand for solutions around data privacy, security and risks, among others.
 
 Speaking about the new sectors, where the company is seeing a lot of traction, Sood pointed to retail, CPG (consumer packaged goods) and F&B (food and beverages) that are increasingly trying to leverage technology to engage with millennials to offer personalised services. “In the marketplace of billions, address the market of one -- this is the problem statement that a lot of the clients are coming to us with,” he said.
 
 While retail, CPG and F&B segments are growing for the company, GlobalLogic has been mainly focussed on three areas -- communication & automotive, medical equipment & healthcare and media.
 
 The company has a global headcount of 11,000, of which over 6,000 are in India. Hyderabad accounts for over 2,800 employees. The company has around 200 clients.
