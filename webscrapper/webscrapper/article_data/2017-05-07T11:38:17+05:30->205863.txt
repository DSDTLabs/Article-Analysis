HARIDWAR: A two-day meet of the RSS-affiliate body Muslim Rashtriya Manch ( ) concluded at Piran Kaliyar near Roorkee on Saturday. Addressing the inaugural session of the meet, Indresh Kumar, the organisation’s margadarshak (founding president) appealed to both Hindus and Muslims to “come forward together to protect the cow.” 

 He also spoke extensively about the practice of triple talaq and said that “over a crore Muslim women are immensely suffering as a result of it.” He added that over 3,000 meetings would be soon held across the country to sensitise Muslims on triple talaq. 
 
 “We will provide cows to poor Muslim families. Muslims will be encouraged to organise cow milk parties during   instead of eating cow meat.” He added that Mohammed Faiz Khan, MRM’s national convener (cow cell), will embark on a padayatra from Leh to Kanyakumari in June to spread the message of cow protection. On the Ram temple issue, Kumar said, “The dispute should be resolved amicably through dialogue and a grand temple at   should be built. When the temple's history is written, the co-operation of Muslims should be specially recorded.”
  
  Five resolutions were adopted at the meeting. These included increasing the focus on education of Muslim children, a stringent law banning cow slaughter, formulating a law to eradicate the practice of triple talaq, finding a solution to the Ram temple dispute through dialogue, and taking back Pak occupied Kashmir from Pakistan.
  
  Girish Juyal, organisational convener (sangathan sanyojak), MRM, told TOI that the organisation had also decided to observe the 160th anniversary of the first independence struggle of 1857 as 'Salaam 1857' on May 10. He added that a total of 649 delegates (including 470 district conveners from all over the country) participated in the national executive committee session during which the resolutions were passed after discussion. “Almost 95% of the attendees were Muslims,”   claimed.
