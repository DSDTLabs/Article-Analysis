PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) court on Thursday   demanding the stoppage of civic budget’s utilisation.

 The decision is a major relief to the civic administration. 
 
 The implementation of the   and allocation of funds for projects would have been halted if the demand of agitating Nationalist   (NCP) corporators was met. The corporators had appealed the court to stop allocation of funds, blaming the BJP of discrimination.
 
 “The plea to stop the funds has been rejected. A status quo was demanded on the budget utilisation, so even that was rejected. There is no restriction on utilisation of civic funds,” head of PMC’s law department   said.
 
 For the first time in the history of PMC, the municipal budget was challenged in court by the elected members. The final hearing on the petition was completed on Wednesday.
 
 “The demand has been rejected but the case will continue in the days to come. The main argument is to define if the discrimination has taken place,”  , one of the petitioners, said. 
 
 The corporators opposing the budget claim that the elected members said the members of ruling parties are getting an average of Rs 5 crore to Rs 6 crore per head, while those in the opposition are getting only Rs 2 crore to Rs 3 crore.
 
 The general body approved nearly Rs 6,000 crore budget for the financial year 2017-18. It proposed many schemes, including bringing the water of Kundlika river to the city and constructing a tunnel between Kothrud and Pashan.
