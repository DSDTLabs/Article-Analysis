KOLKATA: Three cops on a bike, none of them reportedly wearing a helmet, met with an   on   near the airport on Tuesday around 11.45pm. Two of them died at the spot and the third is battling for life in a Salt Lake hospital. The bike that was almost smashed in the impact of the accident, was seized by Dum Dum police.

 According to police sources, the airport-bound bike was going at nearly 70kmph when it struck the open door of a Matador at Dum Dum’s Kholishakota. The pillion riders — Subrata Mondal (28) and Nayeem Ali (25) — were flung off and landed on the other flank. An oncoming trailer couldn’t stop in time and ran over the duo, killing them. The rider, Gagan Dey (23), was thrown onto the airport-bound flank and is now admitted in a hospital. While Mondal was a constable, the others were civic volunteers. All three were on patrolling duty.
 
 “They were going along Airport bound flank at a high speed. When the bike tried to take a turn to enter Chandanpur colony, a helper in a Matador stationed on that flank abruptly opened its door and the bike rammed into it,” said an official from Dum Dum police station. 
 
 The driver and the helper of the Matador are absconding and the trailer that ran over the duo fled the spot. Cops took the trio to Dum Dum municipal hospital where Mondal and Ali were declared brought dead. Dey was later shifted to a private hospital in Salt Lake after his condition deteriorated.
 
 Police are also investigating why the three cops from Bidhannagar Comm-ssionerate had come to Dum Dum, which falls under Barrackpore Commissionerate, during their scheduled night patrolling. “The matter is being investigated and we are looking for the killer truck and it’s driver,” said Dhrubajyoti Dey, DCP, zone II, Barrackpore Commissionerate.
