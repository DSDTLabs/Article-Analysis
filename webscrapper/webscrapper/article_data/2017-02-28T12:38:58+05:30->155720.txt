BHOPAL: A day after   whistle-blower   was assaulted,   general secretary   has tweeted and vowed to security for him.

 In a tweet he said “Sharam Karo shangion Ashish apka hi karyakarta hain. Iska kasoor kewal ye hain ki wo brasthariyion k khilaf awaj uthata hain/Mohan Bhagwat ji kripiya dekhen,” (Shame on you RSS, Ashish has been your worker. His only fault is that he raised his voice against the corrupt. Mohan Bhagwat please take note). 
 
  Gwalior police have arrested one more accused in involved in the assault on Ashish. Gwalior SP Dr Ashish said that the accused is being interrogated for more details. 
 
 Chaturvedi however says that, the issue has created a panic among his relatives who were visiting his house for his sister’s wedding scheduled for Monday. “Many of my relatives have gone back. What do I do? Commit suicide?” Chaturvedi said adding he was being troubled by his security guards over and again. “Police is following me everywhere. People have already stopped talking to me. My relatives have gone back because of this. It’s torturous. In any case I won’t give up till I am alive,” he added.
 
 With more and more Vyapam accused getting bail, others who blew whistle on the scam also fear for their life. Indore’s Dr Anand Rai had also decided asked to upgrade his security and challenge bails given by the High Court in Supreme Court.
