NEW DELHI: The government has not floated tenders inviting   to send their proposals for midday meals in the past two and a half years, officials said. No vendor has also been deleted from the list though there have been several instances of children falling sick due to contamination of food served by them. Directorate of Education (DoE) officials said only vendor who lost his contract in 2013 has managed to return into the list of 33 after the arbitrator revoked the order.

 Government officials said a contractor couldn’t be removed suddenly as he served meals in several zones. “After the   was found in the meal, we initiated procedures to invite more NGOs working in the area. Jan Chetna Foundation, the NGO under scanner, serves close to 25,000 students,” said an official. 
 
 The AAP-led Delhi government, in 2015, floated a proposal to get   to run a singular kitchen in the city to serve all  . However, the proposal was shot down by the then lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung over land lease issues. 
 
 “The foundation, which has been working in the sector for 16 years, would want to a certain kind of space and security to run. It wanted a lease of 20 years but the lieutenant governor was ready to approve a lease of five years,” said the official.
