Rajkot:  ,   

 According to police, accused Savashi Sarla, along with his associates, thrashed tracker Anwar Katiar who is also the caretaker of Jafrabad Babarkot Nursery Rescue Centre. Sarla serves as the forester of Nageshri round.
 
 So badly was Katiar beaten that he had to be rushed to Rajula hospital in 108 EMRI ambulance from where he lodged a police complaint against Sarla. 
 
 “In his complaint, Katiar alleged that Sarla had a habit of bringing his guests at the rescue centre to show them lions, leopards and other animals. The guests would click pictures and take videos. Katiar would protest this, saying it was illegal to bring outsiders at the centre to which Sarla would pay no heed. On Sunday too, Sarla brought his guests but Katiar denied them entry to the centre. Incensed at Katiar’s denial, Sarla went to his home at 1.30pm and asked him to accompany him, saying that their senior officer had called them. He took Katiar in his jeep to a secluded place where he and his associates started thrashing him,” said an official from Rajula police station where the case has been registered. 
 
 The official added that police have booked Sarla for the crime and started investigation.
