NEW DELHI: Billionaire entrepreneur   on Thursday announced his plan to create a site where journalists, editors and publications will be rated by the public.

 
 The SpaceX founder said that he plans to call the website 'Pravda'. For the unversed, Pravda was formerly the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and it means "truth" in Russian.
 
 "Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article and track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor and publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda â€¦" he tweeted.
 
  
  
 In the same tweet, Musk also posted an online poll seeking opinion on his idea. At the time of writing this report, 353,671 people had participated in the poll with 87% of the people in favour of the website.
 
 However, there were others who were apprehensive that the idea of an online poll is an open invitation to trolls who, they feared, will "hijack" the website.
 
 "OMG no. On Facebook people routinely use the "this is spam" flag for articles they simply disagree with! We need better fact-checking practices in online media, not some sort of 'vote if you reckon this story got it right'," wrote a Twitter user.
