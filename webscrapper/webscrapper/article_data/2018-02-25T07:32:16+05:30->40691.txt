ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad  , while directing the IIT-Kanpur authorities to complete the probe into the ragging complaint and then initiate action, revoked the suspension of all the students who have been held prima facie guilty of ragging junior students on the night of August 19, 2017. 

 IIT-Kanpur  , through orders dated October 9, 2017 and December 8, 2017, had suspended these students from their academic programmes and also asked them to leave the campus with immediate effect. 
 
 Subsequently, the orders were approved by the Senate chairman on December 17, 2017. The high court has set aside all the orders. The court observed, "Keeping in mind that the recommendation of punishment was not supported by finding of guilt after analyzing the accusation made, the material in support thereof and the explanation offered by the incumbents, this court is of the view that the decision taken pursuant to such recommendation cannot be sustained and is therefore liable to be set aside."
 
 Allowing writ petitions filed by   and eight other suspended students, Justice   further directed that the committee appointed in this regard shall submit a fresh recommendation or report in the light of the observations made by the court. After that, it shall be open to the Senate to take a fresh decision in accordance with law.
 
 The court further said that in the meantime the petitioners shall not meet or interact with fresher students during their stay.
