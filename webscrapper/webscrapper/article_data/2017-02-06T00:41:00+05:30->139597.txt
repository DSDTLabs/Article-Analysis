Mumbai: A month after   chief Asaduddin Owaisi triggered a controversy by demanding Rs 7,000 crore for Muslims in the civic body’s budget, party leaders on Saturday clarified the statement.

 “We stand by what our party leader said but if money comes to Muslim-dominated areas, it will be spent on every citizen living there,” said MIM city president Shakir Patni, addressing a press conference.
 
 “There is nothing wrong in demanding budgetary allocations for marginalized areas. If Muslims are in majority in these marginalized localities, naturally the maximum beneficiaries will be the community members,” explained MIM legislator Waris Pathan.
 
 Contesting the BMC elections for the first time, MIM has announced 61 candidates. Some leaders of the party have been accused of “selling” tickets. 
 
 Meanwhile, MIM workers “gheraoed” MLA Waris Pathan’s car on Friday night at Nagpada for nominating Noaman, son of former Congress minority cell chief Nizamuddin Rayeen, from ward 213 (Nagpada-Kamathipura). Rayeen quit Congress and joined MIM last week.
