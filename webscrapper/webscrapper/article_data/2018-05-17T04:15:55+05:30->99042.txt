NEW DELHI: East Delhi Municipal Corporation has decided to provide a relief to the people using stilt parking floors for security guards rooms, which is currently in violation of the master plan. 

 
 “The proposal has been passed by the house of the corporation and will now be sent to   and ministry of urban development for approvals,” corporation’s spokesperson said. The other two civic bodies are also mulling to provide a similar relief. 
 
 With focus shifting to encroachment removal, sealing drive has slowed down in the past two weeks and even among the units being sealed, a majority of them are stilt parking.
 
 Councillors Snatosh Pal and Gunjan Gupta, who made the proposal in the house, said the urban needs have changed and now every floor of such multi-storey houses is occupied by different families. 
 
 “An assistant and a guard have become a need of the hour, pushing people to build such guard rooms. Such rooms should be incorporated in the building plans and the existing rooms should also be considered approved,” the proposal said.
 
 Stilt parking floors have been at the center of sealing drive lately for various violations including, guard rooms, showrooms, shops and other uses. 
 
 In February 2007, the provisions of the   2021 were introduced to encourage the policy by giving additional floor area ratio and increased overall height to residents so that all new buildings develop stilt floors. The aim was to increase the available parking space in the otherwise congested city.
