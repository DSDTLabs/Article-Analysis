GUWAHATI: Manipuri folk musician Mangka has come out with her latest single, ' ', in collaboration with Portugal's iconic pop band Cla. The track is part of an album called 'T(H)REE-A Musical Journey From   To Asia'. T(H)REE is a project that has been collaborating with Portuguese and Asian musicians over the last decade, with the aim of creating new soundscapes and exploring the local cultures. 

 "As I am rooted to traditional music and most of my work has been with folk musicians from different countries, when we first started collaborating with the pop and rock band Cla, we were aware of the problem of blending the two sounds together. But it was really a good experience working with them," said Mangka.
 
 The style in the album goes from folk to rock, pop to electronica and spoken word to experimental. Among the Portuguese participants are iconic names such as Cla, Peixe, Amelia Muge and Old Jerusalem, and from Asia there are Mangka (India), Indus Creed (India), Dinesh Subasinghe ( ), Mohichehra (Uzbekistan), Magic of Nomads ( ), Mohammed Haddad (Bahrain) and   (UAE).
