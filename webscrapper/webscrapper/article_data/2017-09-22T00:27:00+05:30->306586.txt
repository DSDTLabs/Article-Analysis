Intense cleaning operations being carried out in the city under the programme from September 15 will go on till Gandhi Jayanthi.
 
 On Thursday, various places in the Madurai Corporation’s main building including the pillar hall and two-wheeler parking lot were cleaned. In fact, many agreed that some of the places were looking good after the work. A cultural programme on the importance of maintaining the environment clean was held at the Periyar bus stand as part of the programme. District collector K Veera Raghava Rao and corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar attended the programme at which a pledge for cleanliness was also taken. 
 
 The corporation is also conducting a series of competitions for individuals and groups. In the selfie contest which is on till September 28, a selfie has to be clicked from a spot before and after it is taken up for cleaning. The picture has to be sent to chomducorp@gmail.com with all details including address for posting on the Madurai corporation’s facebook page. In the wall painting competition to be held on September 23, the participant will have to paint the compound wall of the railway junction. Artists under 18 and above will compete in these age categories.
 
 Residents welfare associations will also be awarded for the best maintained area for which they have been asked to register. Another award up for grabs is the ‘Placemaking’ contest, in which any entity including schools, colleges, NGOs and private organisations can participate. They will be given an unmaintained place which has to be spruced up and made attractive using innovative methods.
