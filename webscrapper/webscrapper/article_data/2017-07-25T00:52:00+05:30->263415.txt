Coimbatore: Thanks to the arrival of the southwest monsoon, the district is receiving sporadic rainfall. However, the situation has not improved in suburbs, says residents of  , who turned up at the district collectorate on Monday demanding regular supply of drinking water and water for irrigation.

 As many as 70 residents of 14 villages in Kaniyur panchayat in the Sulur panchayat union told authorities that they have not received water for the last 25 days. “We are supplied drinking water from the Avinashi-Athikadavu scheme, which is supposed to give Kaniyur 4.5 lakh litres of water whenever water is released,” said C Veluchamy, a resident of Oonjalpalayam. “However, with Kaniyur being the last panchayat to receive water after places like Neelambur, Arasur and Muthukoundanpudur, we get only 1.5 lakh litres of water once in 25 days for a population of over 25,000 people,” he said. “As a result, we run out of drinking water within three to four days. We can’t afford to buy water for 21 days a month,” Veluchamy said.
 
 Despite many complaints to the Sulur panchayat union, the water crisis has not been solved, the residents said. “We believe that either private people or panchayat officers in Neelambur and Arasur are drawing more water than what is due to them,” said Veluchamy. “Moreover, pipelines to the area have developed leak. They take three days to repair a leak, and we do not get water till the leak is closed and for two days after that,” he added. 
 
 It is their second visit to the collectorate demanding water, Veluchamy said. “Officials concerned have not taken any measures to solve the problem permanently,” he added.
 
 Residents say borewells in villages have dried up, leaving them no choice but to use hard water. “The four villages have around 100 acres of cultivable land, where locals used to grow vegetables and pulses. Most of them have now left the land barren due to water shortage,” another villager said.
