NAGPUR: State BJP president   on Thursday ruled out any threat to the   government and said it would complete its 5-year term. He downplayed the   attacks on the Fadnavis and Modi governments dismissing them as election rhetoric since the BJP and the Sena are contesting separately in ensuing elections for 25 Zilla Parishads and 10 municipal corporations in state.

 Asked about the reportedly readiness of the Sena ministers to tender their resignations and the   led party withdrawing support to the Fadnavis government, he said “right now it is most unlikely.” The Fadnavis regime is stable and I am sure there will not be any need to seek support from any other quarters,” he stressed.
 
 Danve launched the BJP’s civic campaign inaugurating the party poll offices in Reshimbagh area near RSS headquarters and also at Pardi and prabhag 21 in East Nagpur. “You are lucky to have provided top leaders   and Devendra Fadnavis who are doing great work in the country and the state. Now it is responsibility of Nagpurians to strengthen the two leaders by ensuring that the BJP wins at least 100 of the 151 seats in the February 21 NMC elections,” said Danve.
 
 He said the NMC ruled by the BJP for last 15 years was doing better work even compared to the BMC (where Sena is in power). “The state has enough water but its management is important. This is what BJP has shown in NMC by providing 24X7 water supply adding that cities like Pune and Latur got tap water once in few days. He sought votes for BJP panel of four from prabhag 31 — ex-deputy mayors Dr Ravindra Bhoyar, Satish Holay, Usha Pilot and Sheetal Kamble. City BJP president Sudhakar Kohle, civic campaign chief Anil Sole, party general secretary Ravindra Bhusari were present.
 
 Earlier in the day he campaigned for ZP candidates in Gadchiroli, Chandrapur and Wardha districts before reaching here in the evening. Later he left for Aurangabad.
