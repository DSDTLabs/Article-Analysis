CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Friday said it has decided to form an   to study the  , proposed to come up in   in Theni district anew. The committee will comprise experts in the field of nuclear physics, chemistry, environement, health and safty and geology. The committee is expected to submit its report in three months. 

 However, a section of activists feel that the government has failed to include independent experts in the panel. Poovulagin Nanbargal member G Sundarrajan, who challenged the environment clearance given to the project said no environment impact assessment (EIA) was done for this facility. 
 
 An ecological assessment was done by experts from the Salim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History. But, the organisation is not accredited to execute such tasks. So the EIA said to have been done for the project becomes invalid, he said.
 
 Environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman, "It is not normal for the state government to do due diligence post facto. I am generally skeptical of government committees, especially the experts committee, going by the Koodankulam experience."
 
 A senior official from the   said the state government only made the proposal to form a panel of experts to look into the neutrino laboratory issue. This panel has to be approved by the   (NGT). 
 
 "They (NGT) may approve this committee. Or they may even suggest a couple of other experts in to the committee," he said. The case is coming up for hearing next Friday.
 
 The India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project is a multi-institutional effort aimed at building a world-class underground laboratory with a rock cover of approximately 1200m for non-accelerator based high energy and nuclear physics research in India.
