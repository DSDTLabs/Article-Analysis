PANAJI: The   will be closed on February 4 from 6am to 9am for all vehicular traffic. “This is to enable us to record deck levels of the bridge,” said principal chief engineer of PWD Uttam Parsekar. 

 Ferry boats will be pressed into service between Cortalim and Agasaim to faciliate movement of vehicular traffic. Besides, traffic will be diverted via Borim bridge on NH 17-B, a public works department (PWD) official said.
 
 Recording deck level is part of PWD’s practice of checking bridges for safety checks. “As a routine, it is done twice a year,” the official said. 
 
 In just 30 years, the pre-stressed cantilever bridge showed signs of distress due to corrosion and accordingly the PWD conducts regular inspection.
