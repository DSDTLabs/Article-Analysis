BENGALURU: While   continues to smoulder, residents are a worried lot. They rue that no concrete action has been taken to address the core issue of pollution after the February 16 blaze that left may in the neighbourhood ill.

 Pramodini K, a resident of Bellandur, said even on Thursday there was a fire behind Sobha Carnation apartment in the lake’s vicinity. “This one may not have been big, but that’s exactly the point. Every day, there are a few fires on the lake’s boundary, but we never know which one could turn big,” she said.
 
 Residents say Thursday’s fire too could have become wild had the wind been strong and blowing from the opposite direction. “The only good news after the last big fire was that firetenders and cops came immediately. What we’d like to know is what action are the authorities taking to stop illegal dumping and burning of garbage. Our two immediate suggestions would be notifying plot owners that it’d be their responsibility to keep the area fenced and ensure no   is burnt there, and fixing stiff penalties for non-compliance,” said Odette Katrak, a citizen volunteer and Bellandur resident.
 
 Residents also alleged that most of these fire occur on the lake’s boundary and on empty private plots which are never maintained. “Miscreants find these spots perfect for dumping garbage, debris and coconut husks, among other things. And when the heap gets too huge, then someone comes and lights a fire, leaving the entire area smoky for hours,” said Dinakar NM, a software professional from the area.
