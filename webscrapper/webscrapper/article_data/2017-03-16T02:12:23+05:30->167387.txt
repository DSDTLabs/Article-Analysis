Mumbai: A sessions court on Friday sentenced a 22-year-old man to seven years’ imprisonment for stabbing a 14-year-old   in a robbery bid at Shivaji Nagar in 2013. Aatish Shaikh had accosted the boy from his neighbourhood for money for dinner, and attacked him when he refused. The court said, “Only truth discovered in this trial is that Aatish robbed an innocent child and also caused him grievous hurt by deadly weapon, a knife. Had he not been treated immediately, possibility of his death was there in the natural course.”

  deposed before court that the accused was a “goonda” who uses to get drunk and abuse residents. He stated that at 11pm on August 23, 2013, he dropped his mother to a relative’s house. Sajid said that when he was walking back home, Aatish, who was drunk, stopped him and demanded money. The teenager said that when he refused, the accused abused and threatened him. The accused then pressed his neck and attempted to steal his phone. When he resisted, the accused attacked him with the knife, leaving injuries on the neck and stab wounds on the chest and back. The accused then took the phone and fled. The victim reached his mother, after which cops were informed, and he was taken to hospital.
 
 The court held that the victim’s statement was trustworthy, natural and inspired confidence. It held that his evidence was corroborated by medical evidence and the injuries he sustained. The court said neither the victim nor the doctor had enmity with the accused or adverse interest in helping the investigating agency implicate him. The court said evidence of Sajid alone was sufficient to bring home the guilt of the accused and prove the prosecution case beyond reasonable doubt.
