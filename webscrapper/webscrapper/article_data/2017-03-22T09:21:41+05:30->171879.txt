VADODARA: Each and every corner of the city will soon be under watch of the police department. A major plan to cover the entire city under   has been drawn by the police and a proposal has also been sent to the  . The police said that with growing traffic and expanding city limits, a vast network of CCTVs is the need of the hour. 

 “The state government has floated a project Security and   (SASGUJ) to install CCTVs in major cities. We have also approached the government and put forward our proposal. 
 
 The city will get over 2,000 new CCTVs under the project apart from the existing ones,” said city police commissioner, Manoj Sashidhar.
 
 “A meeting was recently held in Gandhinagar to discuss the project and Gujarat chief minister is himself supervising it. We hope to get all the CCTVs soon,” Sashidhar told TOI. He added that though there are over 100 CCTVs in the city, it is still under-surveilled compared to Ahmedabad and Surat. 
 
 At present, the city has 124   cameras that comes to and average of 19 CCTVs per police station. The high resolution CCTVs have been installed at nine busy junctions and they are mostly used to penalize traffic rule offenders. “But there are still many junctions that don’t have any CCTV surveillance. Once all the 2,000 CCTVs are installed, we will cover over 100 locations in the city,” Sashidhar said.
 
 While the civic body is busy removing encroachments and widening city roads, the police department is focusing on improving traffic management and reducing accidents. Also, the new CCTVs would help in detecting crimes and reduce illegal activities. The police said that installing CCTVs in communally sensitive areas has helped them in tackling the unrest during festivities and also nab the trouble mongers.
