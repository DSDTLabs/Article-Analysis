Noida based   winner   has walked off with the prize money and the   10 trophy, but controversies seem to have surrounded him from all sides.
 
  Manveer is surrounded with speculations about his marriage these days. Ever since he left for home from the Bigg Boss 10 house, fans have been talking about his wedding.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  But recently Manveer spoke about it and he accepted that he is actually married. Along with this information, Manveer also said that he got separated from his wife within six months of their marriage and also has a daughter.
  
  We came across a video from the Bigg Boss 10 house where Manveer is talking to   about his marriage and daughter as well. He told her in the kitchen area, that he got married at the age of 22 and has a 3-year old daughter named 'Bidisha'.
  
  
  
  
  In another video posted by him on Instagram, he said: "People have been questioning a lot, so let me make it clear that my wedding had nothing to do with the show. People who thought that I hid my marriage because of the show, then it is not true. My terms have not been good, as you can call it emotional blackmail or say that I was under a lot of pressure."
  
  
 
  
  "I got married in 2014 and stayed together for 5-6 months. Then things started getting bad from their side and she had left me. When I prepared myself for Bigg Boss, that time I did not think that it would be my strategy or I would make a relation with someone and help the show generate TRP's," he added.
