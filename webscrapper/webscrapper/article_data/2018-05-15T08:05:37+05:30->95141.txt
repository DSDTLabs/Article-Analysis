 Flipkart was quite liberal in granting stock options to employees. But it would still not be able to rival Infosys, which is said to have created 20,000 rupee-millionaires and 500 dollar-millionaires in the 1990s and 2000s.
 
  
  
 
 “Infosys grew organically, taking in less capital and creating sustainable cash flows. Flipkart has consumed huge amount of capital, which has gone into building the business and funding losses. But they need to be congratulated for creating value,” T V Mohandas Pai, former board member at Infosys, said.
