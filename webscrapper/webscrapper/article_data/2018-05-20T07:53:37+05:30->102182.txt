NEW DELHI: Congress president Rahul Gandhi said Prime Minister Narendra Modi symbolises corruption, accusing him of encouraging “horse-trading” to help chief minister B S Yeddyurappa win the trust vote in Karnataka. He likened Modi’s style to a “dictator”.

 Importantly, Rahul Gandhi said opposition would follow the Karnataka example to defeat BJP nationally, indicating that the new alliance with JD(S) would be used to galvanise a wider anti-saffron unity.
 
 Addressing a press conference after the resignation of Yeddyurappa, Rahul said, “You have seen how the PM has directly authorised the purchasing of MLAs in Karnataka from our party and the JD(S). The idea that PM spreads around the country that he is fighting corruption is a great lie. He is corruption.”
 
 Congress released multiple phone conversations reportedly showing BJP leaders trying to lure rival MLAs with the promise of money and ministerial berths.
 
 Keeping the focus of his attack on Modi, Rahul seized the win to claim, “We have explained to BJP and RSS that there are limits to your arrogance…. The PM has to stop thinking that he is bigger than every institution of the country. But I am doubtful that PM will understand it because he is trained by the RSS to think like he does.”
 
 The Gandhi scion alleged the governor’s invite to BJP to form the government without majority support and the saffron party’s ensuing attempts to lure MLAs showed that “no institution in the country is worthy of respect of the PM, Amit Shah and the RSS. They believe that every single institution can be destroyed and stepped upon by them.”
 
 Rahul pointed out that BJP MLAs and the Speaker walked out of the assembly after Yeddyurappa announced his resignation, without waiting for the national anthem.
 
 “This is what we are fighting, the idea that you can rubbish every single institution, disrespect anybody in the country, simply because you happen to be in power,” he said.
