"What is it about remakes that need reams of newspaper to be dedicated to them?" filmmaker   asked us recently when we got in touch with him. The subject in question was how larger than life south remakes are hampering Tollywood. Looks like we have the answer now and that has come from the director masterstroke at the box office â€” Bishorjon. Ganguly's critically acclaimed cross-border love story that recently won the Best Bengali Film award at the National Film Awards, is running successfully at multiplexes and single screen theatres despite stiff competition from   2, that's threatening to sweep off most of the shows. The film that entered it's 5th week on Friday has made over 2 crore at the BO already. Speaking of the film's success,   said, "It's heartening to see that audiences in   are warming up to simple yet lyrical stories. The love it's receiving is overwhelming. More so because there were big-ticket releases at the same time. But audiences who love good cinema have it multiple times over. The bigger issue here is to make sure there are enough shows to bring Bengali cinema to the fore. It's a myth that films that win big at festivals do not see commercial success. But   did. Not only did it secure the National Award and swept at festivals, it has been running full house since 5 weeks. I have seen movie buffs travelling from Nandan to Priya the same day to catch a show. Bishorjon was made on a shoe-string budget but the fact remains that if you make a good enough film (irrespective of budget) that tugs at the heartstrings of the audiences, it will find takers."
