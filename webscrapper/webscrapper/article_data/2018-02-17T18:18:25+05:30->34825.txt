MUMBAI: Silence and inaction-alien to the man and the his diamantine brand   -pervaded the house his family owns at the Grosvenor House on Mumbai's   when TOI visited on Friday afternoon.

 While the watchman and neighbours were trying to fend off curious onlookers all day, ringing the bell to his second floor apartment with two nameplates - ' ' (his father) and ' ' (his youngest brother) opened no doors.
 
 
 
 
 The absence of Nirav Modi and his kin at this apartment in the affluent Cumballa Hill neighbourhood is not unusual. Those living in the five-storied building say they had spotted Modi not more than three or four times in the last few years. The strongest recall was of 2016 December, when he spent a few days in Grosvenor House for Neeshal's wedding, and later for a few hours in 2017 when he was supposedly accompanied by income tax officers. Modi's immediate neighbour happens to be film personality and former sheriff of Mumbai Kiran Shantaram. "We know he lived here but we were never friendly," was all Shantaram's wife Jyoti said.
 
 However, the abandoned apartment is not vacant at present. Three domestic help continue to live there acting as caretakers. "They hardly step out. The only visitors they get sometimes are courier delivery men who aren't allowed beyond the lobby or Nirav's office staffers who have been carrying two meals for them," said a security guard.
 
 A few miles away is Gokul Apartment where Modi's uncle   owns a penthouse, and which has been lying uninhabited for years. 
 
 Samudra Mahal in Worli, where Modi owns a penthouse apartment, was off bounds for media on Friday. CBI had sealed the flat, but committee members chose to reserve comment.
