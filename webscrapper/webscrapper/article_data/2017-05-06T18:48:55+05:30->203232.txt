Pune: City-based Bank of Maharashtra on Thursday reported a record net loss of Rs 455 crore for the three-month period ended March 2017 due to a steep rise in  . The bank had registered a net loss of Rs 120 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 “This has been the biggest all-time loss for us,” said  , managing director and CEO of the bank, while attributing it to the rapid increase in non-performing assets (NPAs) during the financial year. In FY17, the bank’s gross NPAs rose to 16.93% (Rs 17,189 crore) of total loans against 9.34% (Rs 10,386 crore) in FY16. As of March 2017, the bank had set aside Rs 3,800 crore as cover against bad loans. This provision is 80% more than the one made in the period during the previous year.
 
 Marathe said the bank will focus on growing its retail credit and bad loan recoveries to turn the situation around. The bank recovered Rs 1,291 crore in FY17 against Rs 1,010 crore in the previous fiscal. This and other efforts like upgradation and write-offs helped the bank reduce Rs 3,763 crore bad loans in FY17 as against Rs 3,126 crore in FY16.
 
 Marathe said the bank has formed asset recovery cells at zonal offices. “We will will be more aggressive and tough on wilful defaulters,” he said.
 The bank said that it has shared a list of about 100 borrowers identified as wilful defaulters with the RBI with loans amounting to about Rs 800 crore. “We are in process of examining the incidence of wilful default in respect of another 50 accounts and on evaluation of the facts, the needful will be done,” the bank said in a note shared with ToI. The bank will also focus on reducing expenses in the current fiscal. It will look to rationalise its 32 zonal offices and add no new branches in the current fiscal.
 
 The bank has also taken a “conscious decision to avoid exposure in corporate advances” and will limit the flow of credit to big corporates till they are ‘AAA’ rated. In FY17, the bank’s overall credit fell by 8.72% while its large and medium corporate credit growth fell by 23% and 26%, respectively.
