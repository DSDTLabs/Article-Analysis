MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Wednesday sought response from the education department on a plea accusing it of not opening the government higher secondary school building besides denying facilities to a panchayat union school at   in Madurai. 

 Petitioner M Muthuselvam from Arapalayam in Maduria said through his counsel   that the government had constructed the building for the government higher secondary school in   in Thiruparankundram at a cost of Rs 1.5 crore. However it was yet to open though around 200 students were studying in the school. 
 
 The panchayat union middle school functioning on the same premises also lacked facilities despite around 400 students of socially and economically backward sections studying there. The school was started as a primary school in 1952 and upgraded as middle school in 1964. Though only 200 students could be accommodated in the school, 400 were studying now and both the students and teachers had to make do with one toilet. The condition of the toilet was also not good. Besides, adequate drinking water was not available on the campus, the counsel said.
