 “The political party has been formed to ensure development and uplift of most backward communities and Shias in particular. Shias are an extremely backward Muslim minority which has been deprived of rights assured under various government schemes, as part of a larger conspiracy. This alienated us from social and political empowerment of successive governments," he said.
