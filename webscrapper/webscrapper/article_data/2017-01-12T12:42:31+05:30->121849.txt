PATNA: RJD president   is set to get Rs 10,000 per month as pension from the Bihar government under the JP Senani Samman Yojana.

 “Lalu’s application has been found valid. The state home department will soon send an advice to the treasury and bank concerned for payment of pension to him,” a home department official told TOI on Wednesday, preferring anonymity.
 
 Lalu was jailed under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA) at Bankipore (Patna) jail during the 1974 Chhatra movement for opposing the Emergency imposed by then PM  . It was on this basis that he recently applied for pension.
 
 As per rules, those jailed for more than six months under the MISA and Defence of India Rules (DIR) from March 18, 1974 to March 21, 1977, are entitled for a monthly pension of Rs 10,000. Those who were in the prison for less than six months are entitled for Rs 5,000 as monthly pension. 
 
 Lalu was the Patna University Students' Union (PUSU) president in 1974 when Sarvodayee leader Jayaprakash Narayan, popularly known as JP, launched the   (total revolution) movement and gave a call to students to join the movement. Lalu joined the agitation and was jailed.
 
 Lalu also named his first daughter Misa Bharti after the draconian ‘MISA’. An MBBS, she is now a Rajya Sabha member of RJD. 
 
 Application of around 3,100 people have so far been approved for the pension while around 2,500 people are already getting it. The scheme was rolled out in 2009 during Nitish Kumar’s first tenure (2005-10) as chief minister.
 
 As per the rules, Lalu will be entitled for the pension with retrospective effect since 2009 and, as such, will get arrears.
