 aka Rudra Singh Oberoi of  , has reportedly quit the show to pursue his silver screen dreams. The show revolves around three brothers Shivaay ( ), Omkara (Kunal Jaisingh) and Rudra (Leenesh Mattoo).
 
  The makers of the show have recently launched a spin-off, Dil Boley Oberoi, to focus on Omkara and Rudra's love stories. However, things seem to have gone a little awry , as Rudra's character was not getting enough screen space in either of the shows. Earlier Leenesh had quit Suhani Si Ek Ladki, to do Ishqbaaz.
  
  
 
  
 
  
  His screen chemistry with Nakuul Mehta and Kunal Jaisingh who played his brothers was much applauded. Even his brief romantic sequences with Saumya ( ) got him a huge fan base.
  
  There are reports suggesting that Leenesh who's always wanted to do Bollywood films has got a meaty role in a film, and is currently serving his notice period on the show till April end. Speculations were strengthened when one of his latest Instagram post read, “If things go wrong, don't go with them!“ and created a buzz on social media amongst his fans. His fans soon started pleading to him not to quit on his social media accounts.
  
  
  
  
  According to a source in the channel, on which the show is airing, Leenesh is on a temporary break to “spend some quality time with his family“.
  
  We tried contacting Leenesh, but he did not revert at the time of going to press. Well, we hope that Leenesh has a change of heart and all this turns out to be mere rumors.Incidentally , Barun Sobti who'd played the lead in Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon? made by the Ishqbaaz makers, had quit IPKKND, at the peak of his popularity to pursue his Bollywood dreams, in 2012.
