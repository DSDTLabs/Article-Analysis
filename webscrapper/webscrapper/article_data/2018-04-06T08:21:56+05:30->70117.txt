LUDHIANA: Cops at Marado police post in the city have been accused of ‘inaction’ over the death of  , a 50-year-old autorickshaw driver from SBS Nagar. Charanjeet’s sister and relatives protested at the police post on Thursday afternoon, alleging that he was thrashed to death by his family members — including his wife and two sons — on Wednesday night, who later hanged his body from the ceiling fan.

 On Thursday, when Charanjeet’s sister and other relatives reached his house, they noticed bruises and injury marks on his body. In her complaint to the police, Charanjeet’s sister Rajni from Dugri said her brother used to drive a rented autorickshaw, while his sons — Sukhdev and   — owned two autorickshaws.
 
 She further alleged that after consistent requests, Sukhdev allowed Charanjeet to drive his auto. On Tuesday, the police issued Charanjeet a challan. When Sukhdev come to know about it, he started fighting with his father and thrashed him to death, alleged Rajni, who said his wife and sons would often beat him up over his drinking habit.
 
 She added: “On Tuesday, when Sukhdev thrashed Charanjeet, I asked my nephew to take him to hospital for treatment. By late night, I received a call that Charanjeet had hanged himself. However, I am sure his sons and wife have killed him.”
 
 With a demand for registering an FIR against the family, Charanjeet’s kin reached Marado police post. In-charge of the police post, ASI  , said police would wait for Charanjeet’s post-mortem report before proceeding further.
