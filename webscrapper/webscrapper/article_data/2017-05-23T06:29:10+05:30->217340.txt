KOLKATA: The   ceased to exist in 1900 and it took another 117 years to repeal the Stage-Carriages Act 1861, which enabled magistrates or commissioners to give licence to carriages drawn by horses. On Monday, state transport minister   tabled the bill repealing this 156-year-old act.

 The decision to repeal the bill comes after the law commission of India in the second interim report of their study “Legal Enactments: Simplifications and Streamlining” (LESS) identified 113 laws as “Obsolete Laws: Warranting Immediate Repeal” and made recommendations to the respective governments for repealing. The Modi government repealed 1,159 obsolete acts in the last two years. The Stage-Carriages Act fell in this category.
 
 Adhikari said, “The law was made for the horse-drawn carriages which have made their way out long ago. At present, there is no need for this act and following the law commission’s recommendation, we have decided to repeal it. However, this will not affect the horse-drawn carriages of the city or the carriages hired for weddings. They will function as they were doing before.”
 
 Horse-drawn trams were introduced in the city in 1873 and were withdrawn in phases in 1900 after the introduction of electric trams. Not only the Stage-Carriages Act, but the law commission has also made recommendations for repealing Bengal Indigo Contracts Act of 1836, Sati Regulation Bengal of 1829, Bengal Ghatwali Lands Act, Act 5 of 1859, Bengal Rent Act, Act 10 of 1859, Bengal Land Revenue Sales Act, Act 11 of 1859, Murshidabad Act, Act 15 of 1891,  , Act 5 of 1892 and The Bihar and West Bengal (Transfer of Territories) Act, Act 40 of 1956. “These acts have no implications now and so should be removed,” a state official said.
 
 According to senior officials of the transport department, the Stage-Carriages Act became obsolete in 1919 when the British government introduced the Calcutta Hackney-Carriage Act in 1919. The act defined a hackney-carriage as “any wheeled vehicle, drawn by horses and used for the conveyance of passengers, which is kept, offered or plies for hire by the hour or day or according to distance”. “This act came into being after the introduction of electric trams in 1900. This is more or less a replica of the Stage-Carriages Act,” the official added.
