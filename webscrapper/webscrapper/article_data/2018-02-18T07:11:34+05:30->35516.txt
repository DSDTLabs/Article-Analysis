HYDERABAD: Thirst in   will be a thing of the past for wildlife in   The forest department has taken an initiative to create water bodies in forests. During summers, animals venture out of the forest searching for water and fall prey to hunters. When animals are not forced to leave the forest, not only will they be safe, but also those living close to their habitat. With this in mind, forest department officials will undertake another forest survey on February 24-25 to identity natural water bodies.

 After the survey, officials would decide where to create a water body, if there is none, so that animals do not leave the forest. Volunteers and forest officials had recently undertaken a survey on wildlife in Telangana forests as part of an all-India exercise.
 
 
 Forest minister Jogu Ramanna, who held a meeting with forest officials on the forthcoming survey, asked the officials to take as many measures as possible to prevent human-animal conflict. Forest officials would also specifically identify hamlets within the forest range so that the people there could take precautions and also see that they also do not harm animals. The people of these villages would also be asked not to use plastic or leave it in the forest areas as it would harm animals.
 
 The survey would be taken up in Amrabad, Kawal tiger reserve, Eturnagaram, Kinnerasani and   if there were any natural water bodies there. It would also ascertain if the water bodies got polluted.
