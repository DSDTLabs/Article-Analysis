Jaipur: While hearing a petition challenging the appointment of parliamentary secretaries, the Rajasthan High Court has asked the advocate general why should the parliamentary secretaries be made party to the petition.

 The division bench of Justice G K Vyas and G R Moolchandani was hearing a petition by Deepesh Oswal challenging the post of parliamentary secretaries.
 
 The advocate general Narpat Mal Lodha argued that the petitioner had not made them personally parties to the petition, so the petition is not sustainable.
 
 The petitioner, on the other hand, said, he had challenged the government authority to create such unconstitutional posts.
 
 He said, the Supreme Court order quashing the post of parliamentary secretaries in Assam had made it amply clear that the state had no jurisdiction to legislate on this matter.
 
 The court then directed the advocate general to put forward his views by May 9.
 
 The petition said the state government had appointed 10 parliamentary secretaries with the status of ministers of state and by a bill Assembly Members (prevention of disqualification) Bill 2017 passed in the assembly had tried to legitimize the posts which are illegal.
 
 The petitioner said the apex court while striking down the Assam Parliamentary Secretaries (Appointment, Salaries, Allowances and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2004, said, “Article 194 does not expressly authorize the state legislature to create such offices.”
 
 He pointed out that the post puts an additional burden on the state exchequer and a means to circumvent the constitution 91st amendment which restricts the size of the council of ministers to 15% of the strength of the assembly.
