‘Baahubali 2: The Conclusion’ star   Daggubati has stunned all by revealing that he can see only with one eye. The star told participants who attended his TV show recently in a Telugu channel, “I see only from my left eye. The one you see is someone else’s eye which was donated to me after his death. If I close my left eye, I can see no one.”

 Rana consoled a visually challenged participant saying that it will never be a barrier for her to become successful in life. He added he lost his vision, when he was just 7 years old in an accident.
 
 “Study well, we will support. Sorrows will go away one day but you have to gear up and keep your parents happy always”. The popular show features movie stars who come forward to help people.
 
 Rana had spent five years on the film’s set and sports a menacing look to play the evil king  . The magnum opus from SS Rajamouli has opened to a rousing reception from fans since its release on April 28.
