MUMBAI: Local train services on the  's   line between   and Panvel were affected on the first day of New Year due to a technical problem in the overhead wire equipment of a suburban local. 

 The problem occurred around 7.40am as the train was pulling onto platform number 4 at Vashi station, said railway officials. "One of the overhead wires developed a snag. The entry of trains to two platforms at Vashi was blocked," said an official, adding that it took nearly 90 minutes to rectify the problem.
 
 The official said that services on the Harbour route were gradually restored. "As it was a Sunday, there was no office-hour rush," said the official.
 
 What added to commuters' woes were megablocks on the Central Railway and   lines. Commuters said that they had to wait for a long time to get a train. Many said they opted for road transport like buses and cabs.
