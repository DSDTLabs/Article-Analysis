Panaji: While giving Goa Police a clean chit, Goa Forward Party Party president and town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai said on Thursday, “It is not a police failure. Police has its own difficulties. If you want to go and desecrate one cross in the whole of Goa, the police can’t stop you. Everything is not under surveillance.”

 The minister said it was not physically possible to protect each and every cross in the state. 
 
 “This is a type of terrorism, fundamentalists are doing this and the government should invoke the national security. It should use all laws to crack down on the cases,” Sardesai said. He was speaking after welcoming former Congressman Trajano D’Mello into the party.
 
 Known for taking on the government, especially chief minister Manohar Parrikar, D’Mello struck a different note when he said that the Parrikar-led government was “respectful of secularism and communal harmony”. 
 
 GFP has decided to help rebuild crosses and ghumtis that have been vandalized. “If you say that not a single cross will be damaged, then they (culprits) will go and do it to try and prove a point. So I am going to change what I speak. All the crosses that have been desecrated will be rebuilt by the party after taking appropriate permissions of course,” Sardesai said.
 
 The party has said it would lend its support all peaceful protests and initiatives that are in favour of communal harmony.
