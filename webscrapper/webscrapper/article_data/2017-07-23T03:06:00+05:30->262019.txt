Panaji: Konkani writer N Shivdas has translated a collection of poems composed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi titled Bhavyatra. The anthology contains 67 poems on nature, Hinduism and patriotism. “When I read the translations of some of the poems, I felt that the content was worth translating to Konkani,” said Shivdas, who read the Marathi translation by Vilas Kulkarni. The poems reflect the PM’s love and ardent admiration for the motherland, Shivdas said, adding, “Patriotism is a strong thread through most of his poems, and I have tried to capture them accurately. He has also described nature with vivid imagery and addressed many social issues in his poems.”  Shivdas is a member of the Konkani Lekhak Sangh, a body of Konkani literature writers in Goa, that will be celebrating its 30th anniversary on July 23. The book is slated for release on July 23.
