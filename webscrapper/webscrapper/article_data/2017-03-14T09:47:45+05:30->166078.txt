A   from   of   was on Sunday ostracised from the   that commands business rules for the community.

 The victim has been identified as N Govindappa (in pic). About four months ago, taking into consideration the financial difficulties of the barbers, Savita Samaja of Kampli decided to keep salons closed only on the first Tuesday of every month instead of every week. Govindappa claimed that since he was facing financial problems, he decided to keep his salon open on March 7, the first Tuesday of the month of March that coincided with the shandy.
 
 Office bearers of the Samaj who got to know about this got upset that he had broken their rules and convened an emergency meeting where they decided to ostracise Govindappa and his family. A notice in this regard was issued to him on March 7. The Samaj also restricted its community members from participating in any programme to be held in Govindappa’s house. This was informed to Govindappa through a letter. A copy of the letter was also circulated on various social media including WhatsApp.
 
 According to A Hanuman-thappa, president of Savitha Samaj, Kampli, this is not the first time Govindappa had violated rules. “He does not attend meetings regularly and the decision to observe the first Tuesday of every month as a holiday was taken after consulting all members. He observed the same for a month, but said that he had a problem in the following month. His brothers and other relatives hold important positions in the Samaj and they were asked to mediate and see that he follows the rules. That too did not work, so we had to take this action,” he said.
 
 Govindappa wants the issue to be settled amicably.
