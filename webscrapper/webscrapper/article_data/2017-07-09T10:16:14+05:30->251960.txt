KOLHAPUR: The five-day strike called by cloth merchants from the   of Ichalkaranji received positive response from mill owners and other enterprises associated with the industry on Saturday.

 The cloth merchants have called for shutting of businesses for five days. On Saturday morning various people related to the textile industry carried out a bike rally and appealed to observe a bandh.
 
 The merchants are against Goods and Services tax (GST) imposed on various stages of cloth-making process and at procurement of buying raw material and selling of finished product. They have also demanded that tax returns should be allowed to be filed once in three months and not thrice in a month.
 
 Ugamchand Gandhi, president of  , said, “Since the bandh has been called no tax authority has approached us to resolve the issue. We are going to organise a rally to the block level office to register our protest against the GST. After our appeal, various associations related to textile business participated in the bandh by shutting their businesses.”
 
 One of the reasons for cloth merchants to vent their anger against the government is the difference in the GST levied on the synthetic fibre and cotton. The GST for synthetic fibre is 18% and for cotton is 5%.
 
 The merchants demand that both should be in the tax bracket of 5% and claimed that since the turnover of garment produced from synthetic fibre is high, the GST of 18% will affect the business adversely. “Due to this, merchants and mill operators will have to resort to layoffs,” a merchant said.
 
 “Prices of finished product are going to get costlier due to the GST. The   is complex and will increase the headache of all stakeholders involved in the business. Also, the government has   and punishment to those failing to adhere to the guidelines that are stringent and against the interest of any business,” said Gandhi.
