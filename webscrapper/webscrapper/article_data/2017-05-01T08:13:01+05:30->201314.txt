MUMBAI: A trial court that acquitted   Ankit Tiwari in a   on Thursday has said that with the victim and other witnesses disowning their statements and in absence of other evidence, the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt. 

 The court had acquitted Tiwari and his brother booked in a rape case by a 28-year-old woman in 2014. Earlier this month, the victim denied most of the allegations made against the accused. A single mother had accused him of having physical relations with her after making false promises of marriage. Tiwari's brother, Ankur, was accused of threatening the woman.
 
 The court also pointed out to the delay in filing the FIR, six months after the first incident of rape. The court said that delay in rape cases is not usually of significance and victims are afforded such allowances due to a number of factors such as stigma associated. The court however questioned a "married woman applying these allowances." "The delay in FIR, non-examination of witnesses, testimony of the prosecutrix, the associated circumstances and the medical evidence, leave a mark of doubt to treat the testimony of the prosecutrix as so natural and truthful to inspire confidence," the court said.
