LUDHIANA: Six long route trains were cancelled by the Northern Railways authorities in the wake of dense fog enveloping the route on Thursday, and 17 trains to and from New Delhi arrived late by more than three to four hours, which angered passengers waiting for them on various platforms of the city railway station.
