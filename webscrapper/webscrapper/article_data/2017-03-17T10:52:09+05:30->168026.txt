CHENNAI: The maiden budget of the   on Thursday saw heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition benches over finance minister D Jayakumar paying tribute to AIADMK general secretary V K Sasikala and T T V Dinakaran during his budget presentation.

 When Jayakumar began his budget speech by referring to the leader as “honourable Chinnamma”, DMK members rose to their feet and demanded that the chair expunge his remarks. DMK working president   objected to the minister uttering the name of a convicted person, saying it was not in line with assembly traditions. 
 
 “How can the minister be allowed to name an individual who has been convicted and sentenced to jail for four years ?” Stalin said, triggering a heated debate. Leader of the House and school education minister K A Sengottaiyan sought to justify Jayakumar’s remarks, saying it was the practice of members to hail their leaders in the House. However, DMK members continued to protest, stalling the proceedings.
 
 Later, Jayakumar resumed his speech after the speaker intervened to say that he had already given a ruling during the previous session that members can pay tribute to their leaders.
