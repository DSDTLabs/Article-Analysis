PATNA: Over 200 people visited   on the second day of the fair, which is being held on the premises of planetarium here. The 14-day silk exhibition-cum-sale, organized by the National Handloom Development Corporation Limited ( ), will conclude on February 21.

 Organisers claimed that silk dress materials worth over Rs 4 crore would be sold in two weeks at the fair. “There is great demand for silk dress materials in the state capital,” said H M Sharma, event consultant of the exhibition. “The maximum footfall of customers will be recorded recorded on the weekend .On the opening day, dress materials worth around Rs 8 lakh were sold,” Sharma added.
 
 This time, 80 stalls have been put up in the exhibition. Traders from 14 states – Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka,  , Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and   – are participating in the exhibition.
 
 Sharma said Muga silk, Tussar silk, Baluchari, Tanchoi, Bomkai, Sambalpuri and Dharmavaram silk saris are finding many takers. 
 
 “I visit the exhibition every year. Unlike local shops, the exhibition organized by NHDCL has good collection silk saris and other dress materials. However, I would suggest the organizers to ask the stall owners to sell their products at fixed prices,” said Jaya Prakash, a government employee, who purchased a sari on Thursday.
 
 Vinita Kumari, another visitor, said dress materials from across the country are available in the exhibition. “Online shopping is not popular among women as they prefer to see and feel the dress materials before making the purchases. Hence, this exhibition is an opportunity for us to buy dress materials of our choice,” she added.
