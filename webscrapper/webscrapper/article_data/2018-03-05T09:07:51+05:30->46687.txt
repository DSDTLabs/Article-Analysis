GUWAHATI: The only laboratory-on-wheels in the state, which was launched for primary school students by the state   department in 2012, has been lying in a dysfunctional state since 2015, with the directorate of elementary education, responsible for looking after after the project, citing dearth of funds for repairs as the reason. "

 Talks were held at higher levels of the government on several occasions, but we haven't got the requisite funds to repair the vehicle which keeps the lab moving," said  , assistant director of planning at the state directorate of elementary education. 
 
 Since the project wanted to help government-run school students in rural areas that lack proper laboratory facilities, they have been the worst sufferers now since the moving laboratory stopped functioning. Even though Rs 25 lakh was reportedly spent on the state-of-the-art project, lack of funds for repair has proved to be the major hurdle to get the moving laboratory back on track.
