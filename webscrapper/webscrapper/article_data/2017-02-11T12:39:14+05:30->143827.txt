PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The   on Friday released its   for Pimpri Chinchwad, and residents of the city may have felt a sense of déjà vu.

 For the manifsto has striking similarities to the one released for the   (BMC) elections.
 
 From its promises to waive off property tax for flats with an area of up to 500 sq ft, and concessions to houses having an area of up to 700 sq ft, to a promise to implement the ‘Balasaheb Thackeray Arogya Kavach’ scheme and construct open gymnasiums in the city, Sena seems have walked down a road once travelled.
 
 The party has also promised a medical college for the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) hospital, on the lines of the King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospital in Mumbai.
 
 Observer Amol Kolhe, Maval MP Shrirang Barne, Pimpri MLA Gautam Chabukswar, and city unit chief Rahul Kalate were present during the release of the manifesto. 
 
 “We have concentrated on providing basic amenities to citizens, instead of promising to implement big projects,” Barne said.
 
 Kolhe, meanwhile, claimed that the manifesto will stop Pimpri Chinchwad residents from calling themselves Puneites.
 
 Kohe then criticized chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, saying he must stop dangling carrots in front of people. He also took a dig at guardian minister   who, at an oathtaking ceremony in Nigdi earlier this week, made a erroneous comment about the number of farmer suicides in the state during the BJP’s two-year rule. 
 
 “We have fielded original Sainiks as candidates in the 120 seats out of 128 seats,” Kolhe said. “We have not picked turncoats,” he added.
 
 Referring to the government resolution (GR) on penalty on unauthorized constructions, Barne said, “Till date, the GR cannot be seen on state government or municipal corporation websites. The civic body has also not received a copy of it.”
