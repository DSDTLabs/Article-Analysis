WASHINGTON: It may be fun to converse with artificial intelligence assistants like   and Alexa, but an increased interaction with such humanlike devices may indicate loneliness, a new study said.

 It appears these humanlike products keep people from seeking out normal human interaction, which is typically how people try to recover from loneliness, researchers said. However, there are limits to this phenomenon, and the long-term consequences are unclear, they said.
 
 “Generally , when people feel socially excluded, they seek out other ways of compensating, like exaggerating their number of Facebook friends or engaging in prosocial behaviours to seek out interaction with other people,“ said Jenny Olson, assistant professor at University of Kansas in the US. “When you introduce a human-like product, those compensatory behaviours stop,“ said Olson.
 
 In four experiments, the researchers found evidence that people who felt socially excluded would exhibit those compensating behaviours unless they were given the opportunity to interact with an anthropomorphic product.
 
 However, they said the ability for these products to replace human contact has its limits. The research could be important for consumers to realise how these types of products could thwart their motivation to interact with real people, said Olson. “If someone notices they are talking more to Siri lately , maybe that has something to do with feeling lonely ,“ she said.
