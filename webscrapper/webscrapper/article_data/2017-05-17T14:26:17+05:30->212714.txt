INDORE: Extensive data mining, bank details and self-assessments helped the Income Tax   to add 50,000 new tax payers in the current financial year. Targeting small centres of the circle, the department widened the tax bracket to 2.50 lakh payers. 

 Ujjain   circle includes Neemuch, Jhabua, Alirajpur, Mandsaur, Ratlam, Dewas, Shajapur, Rajgarh and Agar.
 
 I-T Ujjain circle principal commissioner   said, “We have caught a lot many tax defaulters through data mining and other sources. We targeted on each and every centre and explored all possible ways to get hold of non-tax payers.” 
 
 “Owing to this tax payers in our circle increased to 2.50 lakh this year from earlier 2 lakh,” he said.
 
 The department targeted defaulters in tier three cities of the circle hiding behind unorganised work and agriculture. 
 
 With the launch of the income declaration scheme (IDS) in June 2016, the department prepared an extensive data bank of potential defaulters of the state on the basis of high-end transactions, bank accounts and details from various sources. 
 
 Regular notices were sent to defaulters from time to time besides the department also made personal visits to convince people to come in the tax net. Banks were instructed to fill the form 61 A, to help the department to avail every bit of information about high value transactions undertaken by an individual or company. 
 
 Gahlot said that demonetisation also helped in grabbing a lot of defaulters. 
 
 “After demonetisation, we started keeping track of all large scale transactions and this helped us a lot in pointing out people, who were evading taxes from a long time,” he said.
