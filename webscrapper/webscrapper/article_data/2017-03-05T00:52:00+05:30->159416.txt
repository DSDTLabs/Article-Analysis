Navi Mumbai: Civic chief   suspended Madan Waghchoude, executive   (zone 1), on Saturday after he received complaints about the engineering department during Walk with Commissioner event in Nerul.

 Residents complained about inferior construction of the recently-repaired storm water drainage channel and hardships faced due to 11 speed breakers on a 1-km stretch of road in sector 16. 
 
 The final straw for Waghchoudeâ€™s suspension was complaint by a Nerul resident about dirty water flowing into her chawl due to construction of multi-storey buildings.
 
 Residents alleged that repeated complaints to ward office were also not attended. City engineer Mohan Dagaonkar stated overall poor performance was the reason for his suspension. Waghchoude refrained from commenting.
