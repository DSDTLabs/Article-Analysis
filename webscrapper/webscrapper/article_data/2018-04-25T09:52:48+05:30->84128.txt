CHANDIGARH: With mixed feelings, the students of Class XII under the   ( ) will appear for a retest of economics paper on Wednesday. While some students fear the paper will be difficult, others feel it would be easy as the board is at fault for not keeping the papers safely. 

 Now, there are some students who fear they will not be able to score well as they have failed to prepare well. Some also feel betrayed and question why retest of only one paper is being held when other papers were leaked too. 
 
 "Last time, I was sure I could score more than 70 out of 80. However, this time I could not work so hard because I was not prepared for a retest. I feel really bad about this entire situation I am in and that too because of someone else's mistake," said Rahul Dahiya, a student of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 22. For many, getting back into the exam mode was a challenge. "Last time, I really worked hard. This time, I could not do so as I was tensed. I have been giving exams for the last 50 days. This is strenuous. I am totally exhausted," said Jatin Dua, a student of Government Model Senior Secondary School, Sector 46.
 
 Pankhuri Garg, a student of Bhavan Vidyalaya School, Sector 15,  , said, "It is not my fault that the paper got leaked. It is nothing but a punishment to appear for the same paper again. Other papers, too, were leaked but that has been conveniently ignored. The students did not leak the paper but it's us who are paying the price. At a time when we should be preparing for competitive exams, we are still sitting for board examination," she said. Ask what kind of paper does she expect today and she has a ready response. "It will be an easy paper as CBSE has to save itself from the embarrassment. It is their fault," she said.
 
 Meanwhile, a student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sector 47, on condition of anonymity, said, "I am nervous. I am expecting a difficult paper this time."
