MUMBAI: Days after Chief Justice of India J S Khehar suggested to solve the the Ayodhya dispute through dialogue, a section of Muslims have welcomed the idea, but with a condition.

 They have said that Muslims should forgo the claim on the disputed land in Ayodhya provided the   organizations give an undertaking in the Supreme Court that the status quo of all the religious sites across the country be maintained as on August 15, 1947.
 
 The new thinking in the community is driven by a desire to settle the dispute once and for all and enter a new era of Hindu-Muslim unity. “Muslims should put forward a proposal through, which they renounce their claim on the site. Muslims should also ask the government to give them a separate piece of land in Ayodhya where a new university campus can be built. The same campus can also have a massive  ,” said M A Khalid, general secretary of All India Milli Council (Maharashtra).
 
 The community favours negotiations under the supervision of the Supreme Court. “To promote peace, we need to move on. This gesture by Muslims will win the hearts of moderate Hindus,” said Zafar Sareshwala, vice-chancellor of Maulana Azad National Urdu University.
 
 Islamic scholar Zeenat Shaukat Ali said that Muslims would only follow a famous tradition of the Prophet if they climb down from their demand. Urdu commentator Hasan Kamaal too endorsed the idea of a dialogue. “After solving this dispute, no organization should raise the issue of taking back any other mosque,” he said.
