MUMBAI: A baby   spotted in a drain in   has caused a flutter among locals over the last five days. Since Monday, work on pumping out the water has been on as part of the rescue operation.

 A few children from the locality first spotted it with the snout jutting out of the water. “We alerted a rescue group and our corporator,” said  , a resident of   located on Guru Govind Singh Road.
 
 While pumps are being used to drain out the water, muck and garbage are posing a hindrance.
 
 “There is a lot of plastic, thermocol and foam,” said Pawan Sharma of  . “Even after the water is drained out, there’s a lot of muck inside, at least five feet deep. This gives the crocodile a comfortable hiding place.”
 
 Sharma said that local residents claim to have seen three or four crocodiles in the drain. “But that seems unlikely,” he said. “It’s possibly the same crocodile sighted at different spots at different points of time.”
 
  
 
 Range forest officer Santosh Kank said efforts are on to rescue the crocodile. “We want to avoid any kind of accident, but the crocodile has not been spotted since the rescue operation started earlier this week,” said Kank, adding that once it is rescued, it will be released into a creek or lake.
 
 Area corporator   of the BJP said the reptile appears to be a baby marsh crocodile, a scavenger species.
 
 “My civic ward abuts the national park and Tulsi and Vihar lakes. Water overflowing from here has, in the past, brought in all sort of aquatic creatures,” said Somaiya. “Right now, we’re trying to pump out the water. But by the time it’s done, evening sets in, making it difficult to spot the crocodile.”
 
 Zoologist Chinmay Joshi said the marsh crocodile could have drifted into the drain during last year’s rains. “It seems to be trapped in the blocked gutter and has no way out. This is not its natural habitat,” said Joshi, who has photographed the crocodile. “The humidity of the marshy gutter must have kept it alive,” he added.
