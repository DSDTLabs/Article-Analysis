NEW DELHI: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will now make periodic review of textbooks of private publishers prescribed by its affiliated schools.

 The decision was taken after a series of meetings with the human resource development ministry, CBSE and the National Council of Educational Research and Training to ensure that the books are in accordance with the National Curriculum Framework.
 
 Meanwhile, over 1,400 CBSE schools have raised indent for NCERT textbooks for the 2017-18 the academic session for classes I to XII.
 
 An indent for nearly 32 lakh NCERT books has been raised so far, which the council is supposed to make available before the start of the academic session.
 
 The board has also extended the deadline for raising the indent from February 22 to February 28 after schools requested for more time. According to senior officials at the MHRD, the ministry is holding regular meetings with CBSE and NCERT.
 
 “The government is trying to ensure that there is adequate number of NCERT books so that students and parents are not forced to go for expensive private textbooks due to artificial scarcity. This is to check on the nexus of private publishers and schools,“ said the official.
 
 “There used to be a lot of complaints earlier as there was scarcity of these books,“ the official added.
 
 The CBSE chairman has ordered that a committee periodically reviews various textbooks.
 
 According to a senior board official, CBSE will continue with the recommended list of books by private publishers for courses that are not published by NCERT, such as computer science.
