CHANDIGARH: District   Disputes Redressal   directed   Corporation of India to refund around Rs 82,500 along with 9% interest per annum and pay Rs 35,000 as compensation for changing the annual premium amount of the   midway, despite assurance that it will remain the same till the end of the policy term.

 The complainant  , stated that he had taken Amulya Jeevan-I policy with an annual premium of Rs 16,050 for a term of 25 years. At the time of taking the policy, the complainant was specifically told by the agent that the premium would not be changed till the date of last premium that was November 28, 2035. Thereafter, the complainant paid premium for five years.
 
 It was alleged that   through its letter dated July 21, 2016 unilaterally raised the premium from Rs 16,050 to Rs 25,350 per annum and desired the complainant to pay arrears of Rs 46,500 towards difference of premium. He submitted a complaint to LIC against the said enhancement, but to no avail.
 
 LIC in its reply said, “the insurance policy was underwritten by the zonal office and as per the underwriting decision the actual premium came out to be Rs 25,350 instead of Rs 16,050. However, inadvertently at the time of accepting the proposal, the revised premium of Rs.25,350 was not corrected in the computer system, so the premium of Rs 16,050 was continued to be paid by the complainant until pointed out by the audit team in the year 2016-17.
 
 Accordingly, the letters dated July 21, 2016 and October 3, 2016 were written to Goyal requesting him to pay Rs.46,500 being the difference of premium for the preceding five years and he was duly informed about the correct premium only after the audit. Pleading that there is no deficiency in service or unfair trade practice on its part, LIC prayed for dismissal of the complaint.
 
 Forum after hearing both sides stated “that the key controversy swirls around the short question whether LIC is justified in unilaterally increasing the premium of the complainant after a gap of more than five years? Having bestowed our anxious consideration to the matter, we are of the opinion that in the light of the material on record, answer to the question posed has to be in the negative.”
 
 LIC was then directed to refund the entire amount of premiums paid by Goyal along with interest at the rate 9% per annum. They were also asked to pay Rs 25,000 as relief and Rs 10,000 as litigation cost.
