GURUGRAM: The   have sought clarification on the Lokayukta seeking a report in the wake of allegations of providing an arms licence to Bollywood actor   when she was a minor. 

 Lokayukta Justice Nawal Kishore Agarwal (retd) had on Saturday directed the Gurgaon Police commissioner and the arms licensing authority to submit their reports in this regard by July 24. Police commissioner Sandeep Khirwar said they had received the directive, but would respond only after getting some clarity on the same. “We are reviewing the matter legally. It is only after we get a review, that we shall decide on further action.” Khirwar told TOI.
 
 The directive comes after a report by Lokayukta registrar Manjit Singh Sullar on a complaint by Haryana People for Animals chairman Naresh Kadyan, who alleged Soha got the licence when she was under 18 years.
 
 The complainant alleged Soha used the licensed gun in hunting a female black buck and an FIR was registered on June 5, 2005, under sections 51, 39, 9 of Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, at Jhajjar police station.
