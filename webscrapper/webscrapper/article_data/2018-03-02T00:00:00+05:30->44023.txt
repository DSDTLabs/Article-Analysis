Director   kick started the shooting of the sequel to his film  , which released in 2016. The project was launched in Hyderabad on Thursday, with its lead pairs,   and Deepti Sati. The director says that the film will have a fresh cast, except for ‘Naan Kadavul’   and TM  , who acted in the first part. Singapore-based musician Shabeer has been roped in as the music composer for the project.

 “This film, too, is a horror-comedy, but comedy sequences will dominate the horror portions. Like the first part, this one will also have scenes mocking ghosts in a more intense manner. The reception for Dhilluku Dhuddu was the reason why we are coming up with a sequel,” says Rambala.
