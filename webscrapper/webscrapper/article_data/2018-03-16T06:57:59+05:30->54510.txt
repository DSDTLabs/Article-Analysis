AHMEDABAD :   on Thursday disposed of a   objecting to a programme to be addressed by   and   at   on Friday afternoon.

 The programme is being organized by the Dalit-Muslim Ekta Manch. The petitioner Hitesh Zapadiya sought the court’s directions to the authorities to not allow the meeting, expressing apprehensions that it may lead to violence and disrupt the peace and tranquillity of society.
 
 The petitioner cited instances of two movements, involving the Patidar and Rajput communities, which had resulted in widespread violence. His advocate, Anvesh Vyas, submitted that untoward incidents had taken place because of inflammatory speeches by leaders of these movements. 
 
 Citing reasonable restrictions provided by law, the petitioner demanded restrictions on any such gathering, including that of Mevani’s on Friday. The HC asked the authorities whether permission for the gathering had been granted. The police commissioner conveyed that the organizers have sought permission, but police was yet to take a decision. However, even if permission were granted, police would ensure adequate deployment of forces so that the law and order situation is not disturbed. The HC put an end to the litigation by directing police to take steps to see that public order is not disturbed by the programme.
