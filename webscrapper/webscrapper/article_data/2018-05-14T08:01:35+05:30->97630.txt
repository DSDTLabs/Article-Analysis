CHENNAI: A group of around 100 producers including Bharathiraaja and Radha Ravi, held a consultative meeting to demand the   of Tamil   Producers Council (TFPC) president Vishal. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, actor   claimed that   has failed to deliver on his election promises.

 Radha Ravi, who served as an office-bearer of South Indian Artistes’ Association (Nadigar Sangam) for nearly three decades, lost his secretary post to Vishal in the poll held in 2015. Vishal holds office in both TFPC and Nadigar Sangam. With   elections are due this October, Radha Ravi has begun his attacks on Vishal.
 
 Radha Ravi said, “Vishal promised to curb video piracy and claims to have nabbed the pirates. But he is hesitant to expose them.” 
 
 Saying that   must take charge of TFPC, Bharathiraaja said, “The names of South Indian Film Chamber of Commerce and South Indian Artistes’ Association must be changed to include ‘Tamil’ in them.”
