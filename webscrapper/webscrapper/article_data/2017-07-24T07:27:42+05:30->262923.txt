BENGALURU: Mangaluru is set to become the new hub of animation, visual effects, gaming and comics ( ). The government has envisaged huge potential for the coastal city to become the next hub after Bengaluru and drafted a policy for it. 

  "While Bengaluru is still in the scheme of things as the super hub of animation, considering its strong IT background, Mangaluru holds greater promise with animation companies there showing great potential," said IT-BT minister Priyank Kharge. Under the AVGC policy 2017-22, Kharge said it's looking at strengthening Tier II cities to reduce the strain on Bengaluru's infrastructure. He said 120 training centres in Tier II cities will be opened in collaboration with private players and the government has earmarked a venture fund of Rs 20 crore for AVGC startups. 
 
 "We have decided to allocate funds to only those companies registered in   and those having original content with national or global reach,'' he added. As part of this funding, Rs 50 lakh has been set aside as production grants. Soon, other possible incentives will be announced.
 
 The government is also mulling over setting up a centre for excellence on the outskirts of Bengaluru to impart state-of-the-art education on animation and gaming. It has initiated talks with the School of Images  , Paris for an academic partnership. Gobelins, which is ranked No. 1 worldwide, is being roped in by Karnataka for planning the curriculum and creating a programme for AVGC.
 
 "We have already had a few rounds of talks and Gobelins has expressed interest in setting up the centre of excellence," said the minister. The department is scouting for 15-20 acres to set up the centre. The AVGC sector employs around 20,000 people in the state, and the number is expected to grow over the next few years.
