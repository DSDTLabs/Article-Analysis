BENGALURU: JD(S) supremo   on Wednesday said the   in   will have a cascading effect on politics in south India.

 “ If the BJP manages to win Uttar Pradesh elections on its own, the party's focus will be on the southern states, starting from Karnataka.The regional parties here do not have the strength to stop BJP's political growth as they lack unity ,'' Gowda told reporters after receiving the Press Club of Bangalore's `Man of the Year' award on Wednesday .
 
 He said the BJP has already made some headway in Kerala and also increased their vote share in Tamil Nadu. “In Karnataka, which they say, is their gateway for the south, the gate is slightly shut right now since the Congress is in power. If the Uttar Pradesh results on March 11 go in their favour, the BJP will shift its entire focus and use full force to gatecrash here again,“ Gowda said. As of now, the BJP stands tall with 282 seats in the Lok Sabha and there's hardly any opposition to stop its surge.“Technically , there's no opposition in Parliament as the Congress is not a recognized opposition party . The regional parties as of today don't have the strength to stop the BJP. I don't know what the future holds for us but the truth is there's no unity among regional parties,'' he said.
 
 `BJP run by twins Modi and Shah'
 
 Gowda said Narendra Modi was first projected for the Prime Minister's post by five corporate houses from Gujarat though the RSS and BJP were reluctant to accept him as a leader.“The RSS and BJP had no choice but to accept him,'' he claimed.
 
 “Today, the BJP is run by twin brothers-Narendra Modi and Amit Shah (party president) and others do not have any role there,“ he added.
