PATNA: The opposition   and   on Tuesday demanded action against urban development and housing department minister Suresh Sharma for maligning the image of   following a clash of his staff and security personnel with the employees of a hotel they stayed in during their visit to Tarapith in West Bengal on Monday.

 However, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi denied any action against Sharma, a BJP MLA from Muzaffarpur, before his return to Patna and alleged that the West Bengal government failed to provide proper security to a minister.
 
 On the demand of RJD and Congress, SuMo said Sharma was not infamous like   and  . “He is an educated person and has a clean image. He was on a pilgrimage. Instead, the West Bengal government failed to provide him proper security,” SuMo told TOI. 
 
 Leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav raised questions on Sharma’s allegations that they were denied accommodation in the circuit house by the West Bengal government. “Did they ever ask for the circuit house? Was any protocol officer not informed about Sharma’s visit? Had the minister taken permission from the government to take his armed guards with him? On which issue the clash broke out and why the minister denied his medical check-up. If the booking of hotel was done online, why was he asking for cash refund despite the BJP claim of promoting cashless transactions?”
 
  acting president Kaukab Quadri asked chief minister Nitish Kumar to take action against such ministers and demanded apology from Sharma. Quadri said such behaviour was common in BJP.
