SURAT: Many spend years to clear the   but this 19-year-old girl did it in one go and became the youngest woman to become a CA in country. She is entering a field that is largely dominated by men at a tender age, but doesn’t find it challenging at all.

 “I don’t think men have dominance in accountancy or business. It is because women don’t try hard. I did not find it that difficult to clear the exam as I was determined and prepared well,” said Ritu Nolakh, the daughter of a retail auto parts trader. She is a native of Lunkaransar town near Bikaner in Rajasthan and came to diamond city in 2012 after school to prepare for the  .
 
 Ritu cleared the CA exam in both groups with 418 marks out of 800 in the results announced in February 2017. She also cleared two groups of Company Secretary (CS) of a total of six subject along side her CA and is now preparing to clear the third group, with three subjects, to finish her CS qualification.
 
 “I would have cleared CS too but I did not try. Complete focus, the support of parents and teachers are the factors that helped me. I stayed at a PG accommodation and not with relatives, to focus on my studies,” said Ritu. Of the four Nolakh sisters, the eldest Manisha, 26, is also a CA and works in Kolkata while second oldest sister Rushika, 23, is also studying for her CA exams.
 
 “Ritu is an inspiration for women and their families. Despite resistance from relatives, her father had the courage to send her to Surat to study CA. Ritu’s genial and humble nature helped her to take up the CA education and exam without fear,” said Ravi Chhawchharia, Ritu’s trainer.
