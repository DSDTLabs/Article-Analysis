HYDERABAD: The assistant chit registrar of   has issued notices to 90 chit fund companies and their branches asking them to replace mortgaged properties with fixed deposit receipts as collateral security, after investigations revealed that chit fund companies resorted to irregularities in mortgaging of properties, including mortgaging non-existing property, writing temporary partition deeds, and accepting immovable property mortgaged as collateral. 

 Warangal assistant chit registrar   told TOI," According to the rules no chit fund company shall submit mortgage properties as collateral security for chit amounts from July 26, 2016. We have served notices to the companies asking them to replace all the given fixed deposit receipts within 30 days," 
 
  Joint   and Registration department   told TOI,"Prima facie it appears not only a violation but also fraudulent. District registrars are already asked to probe into it," 
 
  TOI had published a report titled 'Cheat funds thrive by inflating land value' on December 21. Reacting to this, state stamps and registration department ordered assistant chit registrars (ACRs) in the state to not accept mortgage of immovable property as security for chits. District registrars have also been asked to verify every case of mortgage of immovable property to ascertain the violations and submit a report in the next 15 days.
