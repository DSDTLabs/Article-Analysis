BENGALURU:   as Baishakhi or  , but their rituals reflect respect and love towards young girls.

 Rita Maini, owner of a boutique in Indiranagar, said: “We usually fast for the first   on falahaar or a vegetarian menu of rice, roti made of dried chestnut, dishes made of potato, pumpkin, yam and sabudana.“ The eighth day is celebrat ed by conducting kanya puja, known as kanjak puja in the community, which is worshipping womanhood. “Male members of the family worship prepubescent girls; they wash their feet and the women put kumkum on their foreheads,“ said Rita.
 
 Kanya puja is followed by a grand lunch for the young girls. “We serve them puri, chana and halwa, which are considered a must for Navratri celebrations and kanjak puja. We also distribute gifts as a token of love,“ added Rita.
 
 Some Punjabi families perform a ritual called khetri on the first day of Navratri where they harvest jowar in a pot and immerse it in water after the eighth day. No garlic and onion are cooked on the day of harvesting jowar. Kirtana and Durga puja at home are an integral part of the festival.“In addition to daily pujas and fasting, grand garba and dandiya nights are major eye-catchers where youngsters dressed in ethnic clothes take part in the traditional dance, followed by dinner,“ said Pallavi Ahuja, a techie from Koramangala.
