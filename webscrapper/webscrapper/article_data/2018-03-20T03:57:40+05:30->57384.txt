 According to a report, the 25-year-old singer was spotted arriving at Sydney Airport on Monday. Even after her long flight, Gomez looked chic. She wore white sweatpants, a white shirt and a jean jacket.
 
 She also accessorised her look with a cap and sunglasses, as well as a pair silver hoop earrings and white sneakers. 
 
 The singer also brought a black ukulele. 
 
 The   hitmaker was also spotted hanging out on a yacht with a few friends. She looked relaxed lounging in the sun with her book. She also cooled off with a quick dip in the Sydney Harbour.
 
 Gomez wore a bright orange bikini top and black bikini bottoms.
 
 It's possible that Gomez flew to Sydney for the Hillsong Colour Conference. Gomez attended the Hillsong Conference 2017 in Los Angeles with singer   in November.

 The two rekindled their romance in November and spent a lot of quality time together.
