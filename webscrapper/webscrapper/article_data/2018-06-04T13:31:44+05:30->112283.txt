CHHAPRA: Keeping the ordeals of the local residents in view due to frequent   from the Bhikhari Thakur roundabout in   to Doriganj on NH-19 which connects the town with the state capital,   on Saturday directed the officials to patrol twice during the day hours to help the vehicle owners and other commuters.

 
 Presiding over the meeting of the district mining task force on Saturday, the DM expressed concern over the performance of the department and directed the officials to work with transparency.
 
 Chhapra residents were stuck in a massive jam on Friday due to haphazard parking of trucks on both flanks of NH -19 from Bhikhari Thakur roundabout to   bridge connecting Chhapra with Ara. The weekly cattle fair at   also aggravated the situation.
 
 The DM also directed the officials to get the bullock carts properly parked which comes to the cattle fair at Gheghta every Friday. “There should not be traffic disruption on the NH under any circumstances,” adding that even if some vehicles are found breaking the rules, they must be taken to task for which the Task Force has been provided with sufficient force.
 
 According to local residents, trucks parked on the road come from neighbouring UP and other districts of   for collecting red sand from Koilwar. Saran SP Har Kishore Rai said, “The delay in providing chalan to truck owners on Bhojpur side causes long queue of trucks. Cops do make an effort to break the queue by stopping the vehicles at different places like Maker, Sahajitpur, Mashrakh, Rasulpur etc to avoid traffic snarls.”
