BENGALURU: The French unanimously electing   as their President is being seen as a victory over ultra-nationalism, and the unanimity in the voting was evident even in Bengaluru - French nationals living across Karnataka,   and   came here to cast their votes. 

 Ninety per cent of these voters favoured Macron, a former investment banker, over staunch nationalist Marine Le Pen. In Bengaluru, there are approximately 1,000 French nationals, of which 30% are minors accompanying their expatriate parents. The number increases when Hyderabad and other cities are accounted for.
 
  The French consular general's o ffice in Bengaluru - one of the polling booths outside France - told TOI that 338 voters from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana cast their votes on Sunday, the second phase of voting for the presidential elections. 
 
  "French nationals living abroad got a chance to take part in the national elections as much as the French living in their own country. The second round of polling took place across France and also in the county's diplomatic missions around the world on Sunday," the email read. 
 
  Of the 338 voters, the email read: "(Mr) Emmanuel Macron got 306 votes and (Mrs) Marine Le Pen 19." While the consular's office said it could not share contact details of French nationals here, the voting pattern indicates the choice for Macron, which has been hailed by liberals. They were apprehensive about Pen, who had threatened to take France out of the  .
