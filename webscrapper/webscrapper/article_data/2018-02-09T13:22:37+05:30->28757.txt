MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Thursday suggested that artefacts, excavated from   in   district, be sent to Florida in the US for carbon dating test. 

 On Thursday, when a batch of cases including one filed by writer   from Tuticorin in that regard came up for further hearing, the division bench asked for the developments in the case. It said both the central and state governments are not interested in further excavation at Aadhichanallur. 
 
 “If you are unable to do it, tell it before the court. The court will ask the private people to do excavation. Already there is an allegation that samples took from   excavation site were not properly sent for carbon dating. Why don’t you send the samples taken from the Aadhichanallur, to Florida in US?,” the bench said and adjourned the case to February 20. tnn
