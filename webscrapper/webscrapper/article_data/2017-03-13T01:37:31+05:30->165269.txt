GURUGRAM: Over 100-150 angry protesters, mostly from  , gathered outside   on Sunday to demand justice for the “murder” of the 18-year-old   working in Carlton Estate, a condominium in DLF Phase 5 on Friday night.

 The woman, Ranjeeta Brahma, was a day into work as a maid in the house of Rohit and Sonal Mehta, who live on the 11th floor of the tower. Brahma allegedly fell from the flat’s balcony.
 
 According to the Sushant Lok SHO, cops were informed about the woman’s death by DLF security, but the dead body was only sent for post-mortem on Sunday, after Brahma’s brother arrived from their home in Assam’s Kokhrajhar.
 
 Sunday’s protesters alleged Brahma was murdered, as her employers would not allow her to step outside and also snatched her bag. They claimed earlier in the day on Friday, Brahma had called her friend, who had found her this job, and cried to her that she wanted to leave, but ended the call abruptly. 
 
 Maids from Assam, who had gathered at the police station along with several NGOs, representatives of the Bodo Students Union and North East Forum for International Solidarity, alleged police did not inform Brahma’s family immediately after her death, waiting till the next morning. 
 
 Tara, a protesting maid, said they want a CBI   into the incident. “Police is trying to hush up as the employers are rich. We’re sure there was foul play, and a proper probe is necessary,” she said.
 
 Police confirmed that a two-minute call was made from Brahma’s phone on Friday afternoon, when she had allegedly told the recipient she had been locked up in the servant’s quarters.
 
 The employer, Rohit Mehta, who has been named in the FIR along with his wife, under Section 306 (abetment of suicide), is a senior executive at a multinational bank.
 
 Deepak Saharn, DCP (East) and nodal officer for North East in  , said the case is being probed as per statement of the victim’s relatives. “We’ll arrest the guilty soon,” he said.
