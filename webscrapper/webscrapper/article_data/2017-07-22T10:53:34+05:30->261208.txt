The INA and Bose have been lost in time; there's more romance and wonder than a factual understanding, rues  . Ahead of his film ' ', which is on the Red Fort Trials of INA soldiers, he talks to DT on why so little is known about that era, why so few films are made on it, and why even fewer ever work at the Box Office.

 
  
  
 That's interesting. Bahut hi interesting sawaal hai. INA martyrs who fought for the country and the Indians who were in the British Indian Army fighting for the crown - toh kisko shaheed bola jaye yeh toh ek behas ka mudda hai. Lekin reality wohi hai ki actually shaheed toh INA walon ko manna chahiye jinko hum mante nahin, jinke baare mein zyada logon ko pata bhi nahin hai. Pachhees hazaar log marey thay, chaalis hazar logon ne INA form ki thi - buri haalat thi unki. Toh unke baare mein toh na hi school ki books mein padhaya jata aur na hi humne film banayi hai. Iske jab trailer aate hain toh achhe padhe-likhe log kehte hain, 'Yaar yeh kya tha?' Iske baare mein humein toh pata nahin tha, kya koi fauj bhi thi kya?' 
 
  There is so much random talk about Bose, romantic tales, Gumnami Baba and all that, but very few know the facts. I tell them yaar aap logon ne Shubhas Chandra Bose ko Manohar kahaniyan bana diya hai! Kiya kya tha unhone yeh toh kisi ko pata hi nahin. Aur aaj saari parties unki legacy ko claim karna chahti hain.Ye ek kism ka...
 
 
 Ji bilkul.
 
 
  
  
  
 See, when WW II started, the Indian Army had about 2.5 lakh Indians. By 1945, there were about 25 lakh. Itne zyada log aa gaye 4-5 saal mein - naukri ke liye. Salary aur naukri ke liye un logon ne join kiya, ghar chalana hai kya karein? When my movie starts, my voiceover is on this itself - ki us waqt jo Hindustani sainik ke ghar ki hadein uske gaon tak aa kar simat jati hain, baaki gaon ke bahar ki ladai woh Baadshah ki hukoomat ke liye karta tha, uski apni ladai nahin thi woh. WW II - Indians ne woh aisi ladai ladi hai, jis ladai ka unse koi lena dena nahin tha bhai!
 
  
 Theek hai. People can say what they feel. History should always be looked at from the time when it really happened, not from today’s perspective. Aap ko 1945 ki baaton ko hi samajh kar karna parega. Dushman ka dushman mera dost hua na! As simple as that. 
 
  
  
 
  
 Rangoon toh was a different subject, it was a personal film and the backdrop was INA. Benegal saheb ki jo thi was more about the INA itself. Bilkul pehle bhi ek-do filmein bani thi, Samadhi aur yeh sab. Manoj Kumar ki ek film thi - bahut hi funny scene tha ek. Ashok Kumar old INA veteran hain, bed-ridden, utha nahin ja raha, toh Manoj Kumar transistor pe ‘Kadam Kadam Badhaye Ja’ gaana chala dete hain aur Ashok Kumar uth jate hain, march past karne lagte hain.
 
  
 Haan toh wohi hai ki jaise Shyam Benegal ne historical banayi, itna zyada reverence mein bana dete hain na hum history ko ki phir jhumar, kapde aur joote pe hi zyada nazar rehti hai, drama bhool jate hain hum. Wherever we are attempting a period film, these need to be balanced. A film has to be engaging, hum sirf documentation nahin kar rahe hain.
 
 
 It was a big mistake. Because Netaji ka naara tha 'Dilli Chalo'... Are you aware that Netaji had gone with his officers to Bahadur Shah Zafar's grave and kasam khayi thi 'main desh ko azad karaunga aur apki joh proper status hai woh dilaunga'?
 
  So with all the Dilli Chalo, Lal Qila, Zafar sentiment that the INA had, angrezon ne kaha Red Fort bol rahe thay na, aane ka bhaut mann tha, Red Fort pe hi trials karo. While INA prisoners were kept across the country- Banaras, Bengal, Jhikargachha (which is now in Bangladesh) - some were also kept in the Red Fort. Unhone yahin pe bahut badi galti kar di. Aur aise teen logon pe pehle trial kiya - ek Musalman, ek Hindu aur ek Sikh.
 
  
 Galtiyan har insaan se hoti hai... World War mein jeete hue thay na woh log, toh overconfidence apne upar tha ki hum 'worldvijeta' hain. Ahankar mein ho gayi galti.
 
  
  
 
  
 It was never in my agenda, like every director has an agenda that now I will make this. It was Gurdeep Sappal saheb, he is the CEO of Rajya Sabha TV – inke Rajya Sabha ke calendar mein hoga ki humein filmein banani hain. So he met me in Delhi and he offered me two films. One was on Sardar Patel and another was on Bose. Maine bola Patel par toh ek film pehle hi ban chuki hai. Meri life ki woh pehli film thi as an assistant, the Ketan Mehta film. I was just an NSD graduate then. I therefore chose this one. History ka main student raha hoon, Allahabad University se. Maine socha yaar main Bombay mein kisi producer ke paas jaunga ki mujhe Bose pe film banani hai toh koi toh banayega nahin. Yeh opportunity toh mujhe kahin milne nahin wali zindagi mein, toh maine kaha bilkul karte hain.

 Because entertaining nahin banate hain log.
 
  
 Gyaan dete hain, aur jitni picture aap dekh rahe hain koi bhi watchable films nahin thi, boring thi sab ki sab. Apka sawal ye sahi hai. Main toh bachpan mein Commando comics padhta tha. World War mein bahut maza aata tha, toh wohi lagta hai ki woh log apni history ko itna entertaining, interesting mazedaar banate thay.
 
  
 Hum log bahut zyada aise kar ke dekhte hain itihaas ko, ki arey conflict nahin dikhao. Itihaas ki picture darr ke nahin banayi ja sakti, kyunki conflicts honge aur apko unn conflicts ko address karna parega, usi se hi drama nikalega.
 
 
  
  
 
  
 Humare yahan filmon ka ek bada problem hai - jaise 1942 A Love Story ya Mission Kashmir hai, hum history ko ek backdrop mein rakhte hain, foreground mein humari love story ya revenge story chal rahi hoti hai. Aisi picturein kabhi nahin chalti - 1942 nahin chali, Mission Kashmir nahin chali, and other movies on Kashmir… 
 
  
 Yes. Matlab yaar humko news mein dikh rahi hai hai what is really happening. Revenge ya love story mat batao.
 
 
  
  
 
 Ab tak Bombay mein wohi chal rahi thi na virasat - hum dono same college mein padhte hain, mera dost X star hai, main picture banaunga, tu meri picture mein acting kariyo. Toh mere joh contemporary hain, joh bahar se aaye hue directors hain - Anurag Basu, Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar, Shoojit Sircar – koi UP se, koi  , Jabalpur se aaya hai, hum logon ke paas apni-apni kahaniyaan hai. Kahani kehne ka apna-apna andaaz hai. Yeh log trained hain – koi FTII se hai, koi drama school se. Toh kahani kehne ka naya andaaz aaya hai ab. Joh Bombay wale thay - they were bad students also, society ka kya reflection point hoga! Filmon ki hi filmein banti hain in that universe. Hero ki entry waise hi hogi. Maa waise hi royegi, drama waise hi shuru hoga. Heroine ka kaam hai kandhe pe royegi aur gaana chalu hoga.Yeh ab tak chal raha hai.
 
  There are two type of filmmakers, one is a product of cinema and one is a product of life. And I don't mind it. Tarantino is a product of cinema - uski har picture mein ek cinema ka reference hota hai- chahe woh Inglourious Basterds ho ya Kill Bill ho. Woh har genre ko ek tribute deta hai. But Martin Scorsese is a product of life. Uski zindagi se nikli hui cheezein hain, uska experience hai life ka, gangsters ka, woh dikhta hai. Nuanced picture hoti hai, layered hoti hai. 
 
 
  
  
  
  
 It has always been there, aisa nahin hai ki pehle aisi filmein banti nahin thi. Bimal Roy ki filmein dekh lijey. Sabse zyada Filmfare Awards Bimal Roy ke paas hai. Unki har film utha kar ke dekh lijey, it has a very strong social message. Entertaining, great songs.
 
  
 Meri toh unki sabhi films favourite hain. Mujhe Bandini bahut pasand hai.
 
  
 Dekhiye audience ka star (level) bhi toh badal gaya hai. Bombay mein ek time pe ek director hote thay Dada Kondke, Guinness Book mein bhi unka naam hai.
 
  
 Ji. Unhone successful consecutive hits di - Hindi filmein bhi banayi - 'Andheri Raat Mein, Diya Tere Haath Mein', chali bhi hain unki filmein. Lekin middle class sabhya log nahin jate thay. Abhi usi league mein ek film aayi recently - film ne business kiya Rs150 crore. Aaj log uss cheez ko maan rahe hain, chalo dekh ke aate hain family ke saath.
 
 
  
  
  
 Filmmaking ek shauk hai, usko dhanda nahin bana sakte hum. Aur dhanda dekhiye toh bahut bekaar dhanda hai. Dhai sau picturein banti hain aur 10 picturein chalti hai saali, yeh bhi koi average hai? Poori film industry ke, South ka mila ke Rs5,000 crore se bhi kam ka turnover hoga saal bhar ka! Isse zyada business toh underwear baniyan ka hoga. Toh as a business bhi bekar hai. Phir achha kaam bhi nahin kar rahe. Ya toh achha kaam karo, shaheed ho jao, woh bhi nahin ho raha. Paisa bhi toh nahin kama pa rahe yaar. Baahubali har saal thode hi aati hai. Toh hum na idhar hain na udhar hain.
