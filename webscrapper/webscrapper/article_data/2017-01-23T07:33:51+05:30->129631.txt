  In Belagavi, there are approximately 106 examination centres, with 45,000 II PU students likely to appear in the exams this year. DPUE officials here have started installing CCTV cameras at examination centres. 
 
  DPUE deputy director   said half the work pertaining to installation of CCTV cameras had been completed in the district. " , and arts and commerce lecturers will be assigned invigilation duties for science examinations," he added.
