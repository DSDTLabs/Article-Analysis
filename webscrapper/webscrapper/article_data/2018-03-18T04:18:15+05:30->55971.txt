NAVI MUMBAI: In two separate incidents, miscreants damaged the glass casing of two 'grottos', one inside a church in   and another at an AIDS hospice in the area. 

 Around 8 pm on Friday, unidentified miscreants flung a stone inside   in Sector 8. The stone shattered the glass case of a grotto of Mother Mary on the church premises. 
 
 A repeat of the incident took place on Saturday afternoon at Jyothi's Terminal Care Centre, which is run by a charitable trust associated with the church.
 
 The police registered a non-cognizable offence against unidentified persons and claimed the incident was not a deliberate act to hurt religious sentiments. 
 
 The police believe a drunkard might have inadvertently flung stones at the grottos.
