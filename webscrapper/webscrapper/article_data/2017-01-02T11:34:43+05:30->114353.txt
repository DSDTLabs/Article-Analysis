HYDERABAD: On a day conjoint twins   were hurriedly shifted to a state-run  , petitioner and NGO   president   expressed shock at the sudden move.

 "While we welcome the move to shift the conjoint twins after 11 years of 'captivity', we expected state authorities to inform the parents and the court at least, so that all concerned parties were aware of this plan and the parents were around when this transition happens," he said.
 
 In the Veena-Vani PIL, the NGO made a plea that the twins be removed out of the confined space at   and relocated to 'a more open, ventilated and safe place'. The plea sought an environment which felt like more like home for the psychological growth of the twins.
 
 Even Niloufer Hospital superintendent   agreed with the argument and told TOI on 15 October 2016 that "the hospital environment is not good for the children as they are susceptible to contracting diseases. They must live in a natural environment."
 
 KRS Laxmi Devi, joint director, Women & child welfare department, Telangana, defended moving the twins on the grounds that officials acted as per government decision. She added that it was the responsibility of hospital authorities, not the department, to inform parents of the twins as they had been in the former's care. She further said the parents had no right to be upset as they had earlier abandoned the twins to their fate at Niloufer Hospital.
 
 Speaking about what measures they would be taking to help them adjust, she said, "They are now under our care and we have made all necessary arrangements including appointing an old ayah and tutor." Devi said that they had also provided a counsellor for the twins to help them cope with 'homesickness'.
 
 The children's home, where the twins have been shifted, houses 120 orphan and destitute children. Efforts to contact Niloufer Hospital superintendent Dr C Suresh for his comment on the Veena-Vani shifting went in vain.
