UDHAGAMANDALAM: An audio-visual speech on 'Ootacamund, the   and its people caught in the lens of   (1849-1924)' by Christopher Penn, great grandson of A T W Penn, a British author and historian, took the audience at the Nilgiris library in Ooty down the memory lane. It was organised by INTACH ­ the Nilgiris chapter.

 The photographs taken during the period of 1864 to 1915 by A T W Penn were showcased and explained by Christopher.
 
 “It is fascinating to know about the places and the people in the Nilgiris,“ Christopher said while displaying the photos.
 
 The audience was awestruck by the first panoramic view of Ooty taken in four sections in the year 1875 by Penn.
 
 The photographs included Toda munds, Toda men and Ooty botanical garden.There were a few photos on old Madras too.
 
 The audio-visual was a compilation of history , revealing the style of life in the Nilgiris. The first book on Nilgiris by Fredrick Price carried pictures taken by the senior Penn. Christopher, 80, a businessman based in London, was curious to find out about his family roots when he came across a bundle of photographs kept in his father's cupboard.
 
 He recorded the photographs by his great grandfather and his life in the Nilgiris in the 19th centuary in three different books.
 
 Geetha Srinivasan, convener, INTACH ­ The Nilgiris chapter, said, “As far as the Nilgiris is concerned, many things have not been recorded properly. When we came to know that Christopher Penn is visiting Ooty, we utilized the opportunity to know the past of the Nilgiris through an audio-visual. It was a fantastic programme to learn about the history of Nilgiris.“
