NASHIK: Police commissioner   on Friday directed the officials of the local crime branch of Nashik ranges's rural police to inform the police patils in villages to alert them if they spot someone riding bikes different bikes without documents, so that the police can investigate if the person involved is in any way associated with vehicle thefts. 

 Singal on Friday conducted a meeting with officials who fall under the jurisdiction of inspector general of police (Special), Nashik range, ie., Nashik rural police, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Dhule and   police departments. 
 
 V K Choubey, IG (Special), Nashik range is on leave and the charge has been handed over to police commissoner Ravinder Kumar Singal.
 
 Since a large number of vehicles got stolen from the city limits as well as from other parts of the range, it has become a tough challenge for the police to detect such crimes. From past investigations, it has been observed that vehicle thieves generally dispose the stolen bikes in villages of some other district. The buyer purchases the bike without the necessary documents as it is available at a throw-away price. 
 
 Singal said that if the police patils can catch hold of villagers driving bikes without documents and inform the officials, the police can manage to trace the seller.
