KOZHIKODE: Senior Congress leader   has flayed the triple talaq bill saying that it would lead to disintegration of marital relationships in many Muslim families. 

 Speaking at a press conference here on Sunday, Azad said while the   order making triple talaq unconstitutional was welcome, many of the provisions of the bill presented by the government in the Parliament were stupid.
 
 "While all matters concerning marriage came under the purview of civil laws, the bill proposes to criminalize triple talaq. Under the bill, the husband faces non- bailable case with a punishment which could extent up to three years in jail. The bill also has no answer as to who would pay the subsistence allowance mentioned in the bill to the wife if the husband is sent to jail," Azad said.
 
 He said the Narendra Modi-led government, which came to power promising to create 10 crore jobs, has destroyed even the existing employment avenues through reckless reforms like flawed implementation of GST and demonetisation of high value currency.
 
 He said the unrest in Kashmir has aggravated after the   came to power. Responding to a question about allies deserting the  , he said it won't affect the front's prospects in the state.
 
 Azad said both the   and the BJP had equal responsibility for the political murders taking place in the state.
