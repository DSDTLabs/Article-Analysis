Indore: In a complex surgery, a team of MY Hospital managed to reconstruct left forearm of a man.

 “The accident reported around 3pm on September 11. Ashok Rokade, 23, a resident of Himmat Nagar, was working on a snacks making factory when he accidently put his hand in the machine and the blades cut his forearm” Dr Sanjay Mahajan said.
 
 He added that the patient was first taken to a private hospital, where he was told that the surgery would cost around Rs 1.5 lakh. Unable to bear the expenses, the patient was brought to MYH around 8pm.
 
 “A team guided by HOD Dr RK Mathur, doctors immediately planned a plastic and reconstructive surgery to save the hand and life of the patient as there were chances of septicemia (infection of the blood). It was a 6-hour long surgery,” Dr Mahajan said.
 
 He added that the team fixed together the cut bones radius and ulna. Radial artery was reconstructed using a graft taken from saphenous vein from the patient’s right leg. Similarly, cephalic vein was reconstructed using saphenous vein graft, muscle and soft tissue were repaired and skin of cut ends was restored.
 
 After surgery, the patient was kept in Trauma ICU for three days and was given anticoagulants (blood thinning agents) to prevent blocking of the reconstructed vessels.
 
 “Total recovery is not possible but by following the prescribed exercise and physiotherapy, the patient’s forearm will be able to function with 50-60 competency” Dr Mahajan said.
