Chandigarh: A day after TOI highlighted that a   victim was receiving threats to withdraw a case, police on Sunday registered a case against the accused

 Sector 34 police station house officer Ajay Kumar said the accused, Vishavjeet Kapoor, was booked under sections 354 A (punishment for sexual harassment), 354 B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Cops said they would arrest him after investigation and assured the girl of her safety.
 
 However, Manish Dewan, lawyer of Kapoor, said the complainant had misused the law and falsely implicated his client. “Kapoor and the woman were in a relationship. She wanted to marry him, but he refused,” Dewan claimed.
 
 The woman, in her complaint, had accused the police of not taking action against Kapoor out on bail for allegedly threatening her to withdraw the case against him. She had event went on to ask if the cops were waiting for her to get murdered.
 
 In her complaint, she said she used to know the accused but started maintaining a distance from him after finding out that he was keeping bad company last year. Irked, the accused had fractured her hand by twisting it hard, she alleged. He had barged into her house and assaulted her and her family members on November 13, 2016. Kapoor was then booked under relevant sections of the IPC.
 
 Now, on September 18, the accused again allegedly stalked and threatened the woman. “He tried to stop my car. When I alighted, he tried to run his car over me,” the woman alleged. She pleaded in her complaint to the SSP to save her life as the accused “could do anything to her and she is living in a state of fear”. “Kapoor has threatened to kill me a number of times. Earlier as well, he barged into my house and tried to kill me and my parents,” she alleged.
