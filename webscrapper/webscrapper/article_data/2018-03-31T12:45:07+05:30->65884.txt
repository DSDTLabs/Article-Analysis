MUMBAI: The carcass of a whale, about 8-metre-long, has been spotted off the coastal Tondivali village of Malvan in   district. 

 Assistant conservator of forests (Sawantwadi range) Vijayraj Surve confirmed to TOI that the dead whale has been spotted floating in the sea. 
 
 "Currently, it's high tide and out team is unable to yank the carcass to the shore. We'll have to wait till the waters recede a little," Surve told TOI.
 
 The decomposed carcass of the Brydeâ€™s whale was too bloated, said Ketki Jog, an ecologist who visited the site. The sex of the whale could not be determined, said Jog who studies marine mammals. 
 
 "The carcass was highly bloated. It's difficult to say what caused its death," said Jog who is associated with   team. "Some part of the skin on the ventral side had opened up to expose bloated tissue from the inside. The whale was initially spotted floating near Achara coast, on Friday."
 
 A marine researcher said it appears the cause of death was natural. "Since the carcass was still floating in the water, it was difficult to observe, but no injuries were visible on the carcass," the other researcher said on the condition of anonymity.
