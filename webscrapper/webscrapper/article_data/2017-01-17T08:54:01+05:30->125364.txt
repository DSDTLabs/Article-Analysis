DALTONGANJ:   and   will begin at  , commonly known as  ,   DK Pandey said on Monday. 

 Addressing a press meet at Koyal Bhavan in Palamu, the DGP said, "I have requested DC Palamu Ameet Kumar to allow night landing and take-offs from Chiyanki airstrip."
 
 Pandey said the area, at one point, had a huge Maoist presence but things have now improved.
 
 The DGP said, "I wanted a CRPF base camp to be set up near this airstrip when I was the IG operations here. But local residents protested and the proposal got shelved."
 
 He added, "I am told that many families have encroached upon the land of this Chiyanki airstrip and before the chunk of land vanishes, the Palamu administration must do something to develop this airstrip faster."
 
 Pandey also said night landing and take-off requires adequate lighting and a dozen ultra violet lamps are required. These lamps will not cost more than Rs 12 lakhs, he added.
 
 DC Ameet Kumar, who met the DGP in the Koyal Bhavan, said the civil aviation department is set to increase the length of the airstrip with concrete boundary wall to avoid further encroachment of the land.
