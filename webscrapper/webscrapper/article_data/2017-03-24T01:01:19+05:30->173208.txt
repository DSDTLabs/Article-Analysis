BIHARSHARIF: Nalanda superintendent of police (SP) Kumar Ashish on Wednesday suspended SHO of Manpur police station Anup Kumar after he was found guilty of illegally confining a man in police lock up and illegally detaining vehicles at the police station. The SP said the SHO was suspended after he failed to explain the reason behind keeping a man in the police lock up and six tractors on police station campus without registering any case and without their entries in the daily work register of the police station.   Biharsharif SDPO Nishit Priya had found one Khedu Yadav, a resident of Naubatpur village under Manpur police station area, in the police lockup without any entry of his detention in the daily work register of the police station during her inspection on March 20. The SDPO had also found six tractors parked on police station campus without any case and entries.    The SP said the suspended SHO was also found guilty of neither registering a case nor taking any action against those involved in an exchange of fire at Chotki Dhanki village on February 13. “The SHO had not even informed his senior officers about the incident. Later a man from the village was killed by a rival group,” said a police officer.
