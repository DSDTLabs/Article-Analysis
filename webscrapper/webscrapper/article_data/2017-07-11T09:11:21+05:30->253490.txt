KOCHI: The probe into conspiracy in the actor rape case became alive after the statement of Jinson, a fellow prisoner of  . Sources close to the   said that a decoy of the investigation team was planted inside the jail to get Suni talking, a claim which the jail sources refuse to confirm. Nevertheless, what Suni told Jinson in the prison, gave momentum to the investigation into the alleged conspiracy.

 The SIT wasted no time to seek the permission of a magistrate court to get Jinson's statement officially recorded. It was Jinson's statement that led to the marathon questioning of Dileep.
 
 The investigation witnessed several `surprises' in all stages, the latest being the high profile arrest on Monday. The special investigation team has maintained diligence throughout the probe and the arrest comes more than 10 days after a marathon interrogation on June 28.
 
 The time taken by the SIT to arrest the actor even after 13-hour grilling means that the probe team was collecting proper evidence to prove the actor's role in the conspiracy. “The contradictions in the statements of the actor and the evidence collected against him so far are enough to suspect his involvement. The arrest and subsequent investigation with him in custody would reveal more truth,” said a source close to the investigation team.
 
 Amid rumours that the actor plotted against his colleague following business dealings with her, the investigation is now focused on personal grudges that the actor had against the woman for a few years. Police have taken statements from several people as part of the questioning and collected phone recordings of persons related to Dileep.
