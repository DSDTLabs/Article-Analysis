 * Go to a safe shelter immediately if you can
 * Ideally find shelter in a low-lying area and make sure the spot chosen is not likely to flood. Crouch down with feet together and head down to make yourself a smaller target
 * Do not lie flat on the ground, this will make a bigger target. 
 * Do not take shelter under trees as these conduct electricity
 * Rubber-soled shoes and car tyres do not offer protection from lightning
