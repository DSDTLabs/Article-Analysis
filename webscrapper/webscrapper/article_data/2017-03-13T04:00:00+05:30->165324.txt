Vadodara: An oral cancer screening drive conducted for the cops of Chhota Udepur district has revealed that eight policemen have signs of oral submucous fibrosis and while three policemen are at pre-cancer stage. The screening was done as an extension program of World Cancer Day of Waghodia-based Muni Seva Ashram’s Kailash Cancer Hospital.

 The hospital had examined around 1,475 cops at the camp out of which 700 cops had filled questionnaire about their addiction habits. Head and neck onco surgeon at the hospital Dr Rajesh Kantharia said that the 11 cases of pre-cancer and oral sub-mucous fibrosis that have come forward are not very critical. 
 
 “We have counselled the policemen in who have been detected at this early stage. It is possible to prevent the worsening of the stage if precautions are taken even at this stage,” said Kantharia.
 
 Conditions of oral submucous fibrosis are found in India and mainly in Gujarat, Kantharia added. He said that this condition does not prevail because of chewing of tobacco or beetle nut but, because of chewing of supari mixed with lime. “Supari with lime leads to chemical reaction due to which mucous turns white and fibrosis is seen which makes the jaw stiff,” Kantharia said.
 
 After the drive, the policemen were asked to quit their addiction since the condition is not severe and it is reversible. Chhota Udepur police had encouraged home guards, civil defence and traffic brigade personnel to participate in the camp.
 
 The hospital is now planning to conduct camps for screening of breast and cervical cancer for the wives of policemen. “Cervical and breast cancer cases are prominent among women therefore our next focus is on prevention among women,” said Kantharia.
