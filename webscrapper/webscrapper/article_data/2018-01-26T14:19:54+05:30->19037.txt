COIMBATORE:   president   on Friday said ‘Padmaavat’ is a “wonderful movie,” and he appealed to   in the country to stop protesting against it.

 Sampath and other members of the outfit watched the movie on Thursday. On Friday, he told reporters that he changed his view on the movie after watching it. “It is a wonderful movie. I appreciate the makers of the movie. I am sure all the protesters will change their view after watching it,” he said. 
 
 "We suspect there is ‘politics’ behind the protests against the movie. The protesters should watch the movie at least once. They will change their view," he reiterated.
 
 "The film has been receiving opposition from Hindu outfits. A message is being spread among members of the Hindu outfits that Queen Padmavati is insulted in the film. I saw the film on Thursday and changed my view. In fact, the film has honoured Queen Padmavati ," said Sampath.
 
 He said Hindu outfits in north India should withdraw their protests against the movie immediately. All Indians should watch the movie to know the truth in history, he added.
