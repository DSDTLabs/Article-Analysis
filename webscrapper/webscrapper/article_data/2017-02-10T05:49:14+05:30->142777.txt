KOCHI: As   splits Tamil Nadu into   and Panneerselvam camps, Tamil workers at Vathuruthy, Kochi's biggest Tamil settlement, are watching every unfolding moment eagerly as they believe the future of their children are at stake.

 “No one will ever be as good as Amma,“ said P Murugan referring to the former chief minister  .
 
 Murugan who moved to Kochi from Dindigul two months ago strongly believes that   will deliver the promises that Jayalalithaa had assured the people of Tamil Nadu in 2016.
 
 The support of most daily wage earners at Vathuruthy appears to be inclined towards O Pannerselvam when compared to Sasikala.“Amma had promised us so many things, such as laptops and cycles, and Panneerselvam will keep these promises. He has proved his qualiti es as an interim CM during Amma's absence,“ said Murugan.
 
 Others like K Muthu, expressed their concerns regarding 'Chinnamma' aka Sasikala's abilities as a political administrator. “Everybody knows about Sasikala's connection with Mannargudi mafia and their black money dealings, she is too corrupt and will not be able to follow Amma's legacy,“ he said. Both Murugan and Muthu are supporters of AIADMK. Being in Kochi has not dampened Muthu's ea gerness in the affairs of his home state. He said that once he gets back from work around 7 pm, his friends gather in front of television sets.
 
 A few maintained a level of indifference with the happenings. “Whoever comes to power, it makes no difference to me and my family, I have come here to work so that my family can have regular meals. Whether it is Sasikala or O Panneerselvam it will make no difference,“ said M Sami who had voted for   in 2016 state elections.
