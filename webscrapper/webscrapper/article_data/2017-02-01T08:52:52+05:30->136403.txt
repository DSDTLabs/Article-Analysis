JAIPUR: Donald Trump’s announcement on   on campus placements comes as a blow to students of premier engineering colleges and Indian technocrats in the US. Given that the annual income criterion is increased from $60,000 to $130,000, many Indian techies in the US will have to return while students dreaming to work abroad will suffer. Legislation introduced in the US House of Representatives in Indian terms means that techies whose annual package is around Rs 90 lakh will get the H-1B visa.

 TOI contacted two Non-Resident Indians from   who stated that this change of rules would affect every second technocrat from India. “I have just heard that Bill was introduced with some radical change of income criteria. If I don’t fit under the new rules as my pay package is far below from what is being splashed on the news web portals, I will return and work on my dream startup,” said an IT professional from Jaipur working in web security company based in New York. 
 
 Another techie is confident that no-Indian will have to leave the US due to their high productivity. “The game is not all about pay package. It is an established fact that Indian techies are most productive and take least wages than any national in the US. Any such move will cost these companies dearly more than than the Indian technocrats,” said a technocrat. Both requested anonymity.
 
 The premier institutes in Rajasthan that have started getting placement offers from IT giants from abroad are the next to face the heat.   (MNIT) and   in Pilani along with some noted private engineering colleges have been offered placements by US IT giants for positions abroad.
