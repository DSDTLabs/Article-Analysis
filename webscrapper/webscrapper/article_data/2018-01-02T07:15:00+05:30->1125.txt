Ludhiana: The year 2017 ended on a bad note vis-a-vis women’s security in the city, as the number of cases of   registered by the police increased substantially. According to police department data, 101 cases of rape were registered in the commissionerate area of Ludhiana in 2017, as compared to 88 cases in 2016. As per the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data for the past few years, the number of rape cases registered in Ludhiana in 2015 was 101, the same as 2017. However, it was less than that in 2014, when 111 cases were reported in Ludhiana.

 The data of rape cases sounded an alert for cops, as after witnessing a fall in 2016, the number in 2017 witnessed an increase of around 14.7%. Also, of the 88 cases of rape in 2016, 87 were solved by cops, and of the 101 cases in 2017, 98 were cracked by cops. Social activists say the higher number of rape cases registered by police in the city in 2017 presented a bad picture of security in the city.
 
 “Political interference in police functioning badly reflects on the society especially on the security for women. Criminals are getting emboldened as many of them enjoy political patronage. Apart from giving a free hand to act against criminals, police should also be made people-friendly which will help decrease the overall crime rate including crime against women,” said social activist Keemti Rawal. He added that police and social groups, including NGOs, should create an awareness against such crime on a large scale.
 
 Police authorities said efforts were on to check the menace. “It’s a fact that the number of cases registered is more, as we have to register all complaints,” said Ludhiana police commissioner R N Dhoke. Police officials said they were working on creating awareness among residents about crimes against women and also about improving security for them.
