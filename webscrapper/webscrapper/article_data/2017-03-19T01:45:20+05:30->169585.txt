GURUGRAM: Residents of a   neighbourhood woke up to thick smoke billowing right into their homes after one of their neighbours decided to burn trash that was lying in an adjacent vacant plot. This, despite a strict   by the   and orders of the  .

 A resident, who did not wish to be named, said, “The smoke was very thick and it was getting difficult to breathe. I called the MCG authorities, who tried to douse the fire with water instead of fire extinguishers. The team was clearly ill prepared to deal with the situation at hand. The authorities should ensure that their employees are well equipped to deal with such situations.” 
 
 According to MCG officials, a resident had asked the security guard to burn the garbage that had accumulated for a long time.
 
 “We spoke to the resident who was responsible for burning the garbage, which is strictly against the law. She said that due to the wild growth in the plot adjacent to hers, her boundary wall was getting damaged and therefore she had asked the guard to burn the marshy area. She apologised for her mistake and has given a written statement promising not to do it again and therefore we let her off with a stern warning without penalising her,” said a MCG official.
 
 “We will also ask the Huda authorities to take action against those owners who leave their vacant plots unattended due to which such situations arise. The owners are supposed to keep their plots clean and ensure garbage is not dumped there,” he said.
