KOLKATA: A 16-year-old girl, who allegedly ran away from her   residence on Friday night, was   the police on Saturday, almost after 16 hours. The girl will be produced in court, said police.

 The girl travelled more than 95km and stopped at several locations before she was finally traced near City Center-II on Saturday afternoon. She claimed it was fear of poor grades that prompted her to leave home. She even called up her family members from her cellphone and claimed she had been abducted.
 
 The girl’s uncle said she went out to buy some household goods on Friday around 8pm. “We noticed she was taking longer than usual. When we went to the shop, we were told she had left the place,” the uncle said. 
 
 It was around 10pm the girl called them up, saying she was picked up by four youths who dragged her into a car and went off.
 
 As the girl’s family members lodged a complaint of abduction, the   police station and detective department jumped into action. All of her friends were interrogated. Later, the girl told the cops she took a cab to go to Dakshineswar. From there, she went to Konnagar and then back to Girish Park. After a halt at  , she went to Park Street where she left the cab. While she wanted to check in a hotel, she was not allowed in absence of identity cards. She hopped pubs and stayed awake till morning. While her phone was switched off at night near Dakshineswar, it was switched on again in the morning. Her location was traced.
