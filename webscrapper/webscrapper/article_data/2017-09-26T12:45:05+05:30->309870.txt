CHENNAI:   general secretary,   on Monday said he was accosted by a group of Sinhalese inside the   hall in Geneva for raising the issue of human rights violations suffered by Sri Lankan Tamils in the island nation as also the alleged war crimes indulged in by the Sri Lankan army.

  A video clip showed Vaiko accusing a group of Sinhalese of accosting him for speaking in defence of Lankan Tamils.
 
 The MDMK leader who addressed the human rights council twice, had voiced his concern over the atrocities committed by the army and the government machinery against the Tamil civilians in the island nation.
 
  Even though the council had recommended several measures since 2012 to mitigate the sufferings of the Tamils, the Sri Lankan government neither accepted nor implemented the same, Vaiko told the council.
 
 As a Tamilian, he had every right to raise the issue, Vaiko told them, the MDMK said in a statement. DMK working president,   condemned the actions of the Sinhalese group.
