MUMBAI: With the television ratings out for the inaugural week of the   (IPL), the industry has yet again begun asking questions of   Pvt Ltd. Ever since the giant broadcaster committed itself to a US$3b-plus investment in Indian cricket, the industry has been busy wondering how will Star retrieve the same from a very competitive market. In a conversation with TOI, Star India chairman and CEO   explains why he’s shelled out the kind of money he did on   and what exactly he’s looking forward to...

 
 
 
 
 
 Well, as I said, I’m overwhelmed at the genuine interest that people have been showing in Star’s investment. I really want to thank them for it. A billion dollars on all cricket in India. Obviously there'll be questions over how you make up for it... We do believe in this Indian team and that is the primary reason why we’ve gone ahead with this kind of an investment. In fact, the day India won the Under-19 World Cup, my belief strengthened all the more that investing well in Indian cricket will augur well on the long run for us. But you're still talking about a market where red-tapism thrives and industry standards are still lagging.
 
 I do agree that it's not perfect at all times to do business in India but hope persists. It always has.
 
 
 
 To relate to the India story. And you can't expect to relate to that big picture by not including cricket in your plans. In India, cricket is and will always remain the key element, especially if you're looking at connecting with the audience on a long term on a multidimensional platform.
 
 
 
 Of course. The tournament has gone through many ups and downs and kept taking a toll on multiple fronts. Yet, the one thing that has never wavered is the mass following that IPL enjoys across gender, genres and age groups.
 
 
 
 Yes. It's a market that wasn't being served to the potential. We invested in four languages knowing there was a largely untapped market and it's showing.
