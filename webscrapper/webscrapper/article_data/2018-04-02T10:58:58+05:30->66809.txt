 At least 9% of the total property tax earned was collected during the long holiday weekend in March. “We set up special camps to make best use of the holiday break between March 29 and 31. We were able to collect around Rs 62 crore of property tax during this window,” said   and   D  .
 
 The corporation expects to significantly improve its tax earnings in the upcoming fiscal.
 
 In the budget documents for 2018-19 which were made public earlier this month, the corporation revised and increased its property tax collection target by 60% to Rs 1,200 crore. To achieve this, the civic body has started property mapping using drones, which is expected to be completed soon. The local body also revoked exemption granted to private schools and colleges from paying property taxes under orders of the government.
 
 Recovering unpaid dues, however, remains an issue. Corporation sources said that it is owed Rs 200 crore in property tax by defaulters, with some dues pending for as long as a decade or more.
