Model-turned-actor Tony Luke’s strong portrayal of the villainous estate manager in the Nivin Pauly film Sakhavu has been winning him plenty of praise. The handsome hunk, who has played only baddie roles so far in his career, is all set to go for a change of track. In the upcoming movie   directed by newbie  , Tony will play a positive role, that of a student named Aju.

 Tony says, “The film is a sweet coming-of-age story of a bunch of students in a college. Everybody has a distinctive story in it. It would be my first positive character, and I am happy to say that he smiles a lot!” 
 
 Aju, his character, is someone who did his schooling in Dubai and comes to join a college in Kerala. “He is a loner who lost his mom at a young age. He loves travelling and keeps moving from one place to another,” he says, adding that the story would go on to show how Aju tries to fit in and gradually gets along with the students. “The college opens to him certain kinds of friendships he never thought he would have,” he says.
 
 Meanwhile, Tony lost around 8 kg to play the character. “I had to do that to look the part. While working in Sakhavu, I was around 82 kg and for this film, I went down to 74 kg,” says Tony. He says that he has also tried a hand at action in the film. “I have been part of boxing championships for Maharashtra, so I was thrilled. I believe I have given it my best. However, it’s a bit tough to do action sequences for movies. People can get hurt and if the timing isn’t right, it can be a bit dangerous too. It took some time for everything to fall into place,” says the actor.
