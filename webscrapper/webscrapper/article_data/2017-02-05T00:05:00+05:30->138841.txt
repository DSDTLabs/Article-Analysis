Mumbai: Students who have already appeared for the AIPMT or   three times in the past can appear this year too. In fact, the student’s attempt this year will be considered the first one. 

 The Medical Council of India (MCI) has clarified that the cap on the number of NEET attempts will be applicable prospectively. While it has been decided to allow students only three attempts at NEET, the first one will be counted from this academic year (2017-18), irrespective of the past attempts. 
 
 The CBSE, on Friday, issued a notification to this effect. All candidates who could not fill up the application form earlier due to the three-attempt condition for NEET and AIPMT will now be able to do so, said the notification. The Department of Health and Family Welfare, in a letter on Friday, mentioned that the MCI sought a clarification on the announcement made by the board early this week. 
 
 The order has come as a relief to students who have already taken the test twice or thrice. 
 
 Pravin Shingare, director, Maharashtra’s Directorate of Medical Education and Research, said over 75,000 candidates of the 4 lakh who appear for the state’s CET, usually attempt for the second time and over 25,000 attempt for the third time.
 
 “Many students continue appearing for the test to fare better after taking a drop for a year or more to get a seat in government colleges,” said a parent.
 
 An aspiring candidate, P Patel, said, “It is my second attempt this year, but there are students who are taking NEET for the third time. This will definitely help such students.”
