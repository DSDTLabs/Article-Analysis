Navi Mumbai:The civic solid   department has issued an ultimatum to Cidco-built buildings, slums areas and low income societies to   their waste. Notices are being issued to all these areas, asking them to segregate the garbage, failing which, administration will stop collection of waste.

 “It's going to be year since administration made   segregation at source compulsory. Over past few months, the system has been rolled in phases, starting with residential societies. Now the same system has been implemented in slums, Cidco-built societies and LIG buildings. But response has not been up to the mark,” said an official from solid waste department.
 
 Contractors have also been instructed to not collect waste which has not been segregated. 
 
 “Notices to this regard have been issued, so that the concerned societies take the system seriously,” said the official.
