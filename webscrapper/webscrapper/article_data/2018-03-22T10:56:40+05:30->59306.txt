 has blasted   on social media for the inappropriate remarks made by the star regarding South film industry during her interview.

 Bhavna Balakrishnan is a professional anchor, performer, TV host, radio jockey, voice artist, dancer, and a columnist. She became tense over the remarks made by actress Radhika Apte recently.
 
 Radhika Apte is fondly referred to as controversy's favourite child. She often lands in trouble for one reason or another.
 
 Radhika Apte and Rajkummar Rao were interviewed together recently. In that, they were asked a few tricky questions like, what were the silly things that had to do during their initial days in the film industry?
 
 Radhika Apte just replied, "I worked in South Indian films! They pay you really well and you bloody deserve it. It was very hard. (sic)". This was not well received by south Indian TV artists, film fraternity and by the public too.
 
 Bhavna Balakrishnan took to Twitter to reply to Radhika Apte;
 
  
 
 Bhavna admits that Radhika Apte might have had some trouble in her career in the   industry initially but, the way she bluntly generalized her issues in her Interview was irksome.
 
 Apart from this, the female star was asked about her opinion on the lack of gender equality in South films. In this regard, she said, "I wouldn't generalize it. But, the projects that I had worked on, it was evident enough to sense it. The south heroes are extremely powerful and we are called two hours before the shoot and are made to wait. We can feel that we are just treated differently."
 
 Moreover, there was another interesting thing, which Radhika conveyed in her interview. She explained as to why she slapped a South Indian actor who misbehaved with her.
 
 Radhika Apte has done quite a number of films in the south. She gained fame after she starred with Superstar   in a blockbuster film.
