INDORE: The political climate in Madhya Pradesh could heat up during the ongoing 10-day Gram Bandhi, with   leader   adding his weight to the farmers' agitation and announcing that he will back   in the assembly elections. 

  Patel, who will be touring Jabalpur, Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Ratlam and Mandsaur from June 6, wants to act as a 'kingmaker'. "I like the fact that Congress has projected   and Jyotiraditya   - both are from good financial backgrounds and will not indulge in corruption. Kamal Nath has ushered development in Chhindwara and Scindia is from a royal family and knows how to rule. They are here to give something to people," Patel told TOI.
