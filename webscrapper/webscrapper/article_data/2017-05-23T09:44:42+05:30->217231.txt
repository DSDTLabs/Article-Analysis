PANAJI: Minister for tribal affairs   has insisted that his department will resolve all cases of people who want cultivation rights in the forest areas by the end of the year.

 Speaking to reporters,   said that the applications received under the Tribal Forest Act have been received at the   collectorate. “Two important issues in our hands are that of the political reservations and the applications received under the Tribal Forest Act. Today, we had a meeting at   where we set the deadline for resolving applications received from people who want to continue their cultivation rights in forest areas. We plan to resolve these cases by December 17, 2017. There might be some problems during the monsoon period, but we will get all applications resolved by December,” Gawde said, adding that even cultivators who are not from the tribal community will benefit too.
