MUMBAI: Two days after thousands of women protested the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage)   or   Bill at Azad Maidan, some Muslim women have welcomed the Bill, but also suggested amendments. They demand the Bill should only recognize Talaq-e-Ahsan, which requires mandatory arbitration over a 90-day period, as the only valid form of divorce. 

 "Talaq-e-Ahsan is the Quranic method of divorce and Triple Talaq should be made cognizable and bailable with imprisonment up to one year (the Bill makes it cognizable, non-bailable with punishment for three years)," said Noorjahan Safia Niaz, co-founder, Bhartiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, one of the petitioners against the Triple Talaq in the  .
 
 The progressive Muslim women want the abettors of Triple Talaq, nikah halala (where a divorced woman has to marry another man and consummate the marriage if she wants to remarry her first husband) and mutah (temporary marriage) punished with three years' imprisonment. They also want a ban on polygamy.
 
 Some community leaders disapprove the mobilization of women against the Bill. "Instead of taking out huge   and  , Muslims should popularize the Quranic method of divorce. Instant triple talaq is sinful and must end," said community leader Ghulam Peshimam.
 
 Meanwhile, Javed Anand of Indian Muslims for Secular Democracy (IMSD) said his organization would intervene in the SC in the case seeking a ban on polygamy, halala nikah and mutah and misyar (temporary marriage).
