When Bengaluru Development Minister   inaugurated a   near Sir M   recently, he announced that the state government will build 100 more such pedestrian walkways across the city. While the city requires this, considering the burgeoning traffic and the lack of civic sense (how many people actually stop their vehicles at a zebra crossing?), the ground reality is that despite there already being several skywalks in the city, most of them are left unused.

 Bangalore Times did rounds of the city to see how utilized (or under-utilized) these pedestrian pathways are. While the skywalks are placed at junctions that witness heavy traffic, surprisingly, pedestrians would rather risk their lives and cross right under the skywalks than climb a few steps and make their way safely across the road from above. And this was not restricted to the elderly, who could have trouble climbing steps.
 
 
  
 The skywalk at   sees a strange mix. Since the dividers on   are quite high, it is not viable for people to cross the road, and, hence, many use the skywalk to cross the busy road. There is, however, a small opening in the road close to the skywalk, which is enough for people to take a gamble and cross the road, bringing traffic to a screeching halt ever so often.
 
 Perhaps, while building the new skywalks, the government should also look at raising the height of the road dividers to coerce people to use the pedestrian-friendly walkways.
