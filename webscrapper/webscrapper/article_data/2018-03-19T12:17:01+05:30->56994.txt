JAISALMER: The magnificent  , due to fight between two departments, has been covered in darkness and tourists are unable to see its beauty at night. For not paying the electricity bill of Rs 26 lakh to the discom, the department has cut the   of the   the fort.

 Earlier too, the discom had cut the power connection, but the district collector had put pressure after which connection was restored. Now, again connection has been cut for not paying the dues. This is because of the ongoing tussle between the tourism department and the municipal council over who will pay the electricity bill of the fort. Both have been asking each other to pay the bill.
 
 For a long time the departments have not paid the bill due to which the power supply of floodlights has been disconnected. Later on New Year and during Desert Festival, both the departments agreed to   (50-50) and connection was restored, but later both departments did not pay the bill and power supply was disconnected on Sunday.
 
 Discom SE CS Meena said both departments during the New Year and Desert Festival gave in writing to pay the bill, but both did not pay. The departments were served notice to pay the bill 15 days ago, but they did pay any heed. After power supply being disconnected the tourists are disappointed as they are not able to see the beauty of the fort at night.
 
    Kolisteni said that she had heard the fort looks beautiful at night, but as there were no lights on Sunday, she was disappointed and the fort looked gloomy in dark.
 
 To showcase the beauty of the fort at night, the state government in 1996-97 installed 540 floodlights around the fort. At that time Rs 36 lakh were spent to install the lights. Since then the beauty of the fort was witnessed every night by the tourists and locals.
 
 The fort, drenched in light, looked beautiful even from a distance. But now things have changed and in the tussle between two departments it is the tourists who are a disappointed lot.
