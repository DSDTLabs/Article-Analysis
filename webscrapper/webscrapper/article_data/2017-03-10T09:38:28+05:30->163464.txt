VADODARA: The sessions court here rejected application of Sumandeep Vidyapeeth’s founder,  , to have home-cooked food and boiled water in the jail.

 Shah had told the court that he practices Jainism and consumes food before 6 pm according to the rituals of the religion. On Thursday, public prosecutor   argued that Shah has been kept in the high-security zone of the jail premises. According to the notification of the prisons department of the state government, the inmates kept in the high-security zone are not allowed to have home-cooked food, the public prosecutor argued opposing Shah’s application.
 
 Shah’s lawyer Nehal Dave questioned the decision of keeping him in the high-security zone, since those involved in terror activities and other big crimes are kept in high-security zone. The jail authorities also told the court that there are facilities for providing Jain food and boiled water in the jail and they are ready to provide that to Shah.
 
 The principal district and sessions judge J C Doshi rejected the application after hearing the arguments since the jail has provision for Jain food and boiled water.
 
 In his application, Shah had told the court that he has not consumed food since March 6 and expressed fears that his health could deteriorate if the situation persisted.
