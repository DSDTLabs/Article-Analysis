LUCKNOW: Though he figured prominently on the cover of party manifesto,   chose to skip the event when his son  , in his first public appearance after becoming SP chief, released the manifesto on Sunday. Uncle Shivpal, who stood by Mulayam in the family feud, was also absent. 

 Mulayam's absence led to speculation that the rift between father and son had revived, but he made a last-minute appearance along with senior minister   when the function was about to conclude.
 
 Earlier, as party leaders rose to address the gathering, an empty chair next to Akhilesh added to speculation that Mulayam may join the event later. 
 
 But as time passed it became clear that Netaji (Mulayam), who was present at his Vikramaditya Marg residence, won't attend the function.
 
 What left the audience and the media guessing about Mulayam's presence at the event was a phone call that Akhikesh received minutes after he came on the dais flanked by senior ministers Azam Khan, Ahmed Hasan, Balwant Singh Ramoowalia and others. Soon, Azam left for Mulayam's residence apparently to convince SP patriarch to attend the function.
 
  However, once it was clear that Mulayam will not come, Akhilesh began his address. He mentioned Mulayam when he spoke about his government's laptops scheme and how it has benefited students. "The highlight of the laptops is that as it is switched on a photograph of Netaji (Mulayam) and myself comes on the screen ... something which no one can erase," he said. 
 
 However, just after conclusion of the event, Mulayam's motorcade entered the SP headquarters. Akhilesh, who had just left the party office, came back along with Dimple to join Mulayam and Azam. The four remained closeted for an hour.
