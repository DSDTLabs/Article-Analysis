Tirupur: The city police on Wednesday registered a case against an unidentified Facebook user for allegedly posting a morphed and abusive image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 

 “The image targets Modi on the Cauvery issue,” police said. The case was registered based on a complaint from Tirupur north district BJP president R Chinnasamy. 
 
 Chinnasamy said, “We noticed a morphed image of the PM on Facebook. It was abusive in nature and totally disgraceful to the PM. When we checked the details of the user, we found that he was a mechanic working in Tirupur. But it was a fake ID. As it has affected our sentiments, I lodged a complaint with the Tirupur north police.”
 
 Police registered a case under Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. “The FB ID was fake and we were not able to trace it,” a police officer said.
 
 Police have made a request to the FB to help them trace the suspect. It could take a few more days to get reply from the FB. The reply from FB headquarters in California was expected soon, said the sources.
 
 Chinnasamy also lodged another complaint against a man who called him and abused Modi and his wife. The caller also used abusive language against few Union ministers.
