MANALI: Eight houses, a cowshed and a car were destroyed after a   in   panchayat of Nither sub-tehsil in   district spread to   village on Friday . 

 According to villagers, all the houses destroyed in fire were two-storeyed and made of wood. “We tried to douse the flames by throwing mud on them, but it was an useless effort. Everything was destroyed by the time a team of firemen reached here,” said Virender Kumar, whose house was gutted. 
 
 Villagers alleged that the fire tenders came from   Bushahr, which is too far away from the village. The village has a small road built by the panchayat itself. 
 
 Anni sub-divisional magistrate   said eight houses were gutted in fire. “A cowshed, one cow and a calf were also burnt alive. The houses belong to 17 families but nobody has become homeless as all of them have houses at other places. An immediate relief of Rs 1.20 lakh has been given to the families. Fire tenders from Rampur are still working to douse the fire. Fire is now under control,” she said.
 
 Forest fires are being reported from many places in Kullu. While fire and forest departments are not equipped properly to control the forest fires, villagers risk their lives to douse them. There are many incidents when fire reaches close to human settlements. Last year, the villagers had threatened to boycott assembly elections unless their demand for basic amenities and proper road connectivity was not accepted. However, netas convinced them to use their franchise and promised to provide them better road connectivity. Nothing has happened on that front so far.
