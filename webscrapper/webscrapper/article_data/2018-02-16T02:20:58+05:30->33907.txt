NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday refuted the opposition’s charge that diamantaire   Modi, who is wanted for the country’s biggest-ever bank fraud, was part of the official Indian delegation during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s trip last month to   for the World Economic   meeting. 

 With the opposition pointing to the disgraced diamantaire’s photograph with the PM during in Davos, sources in the foreign ministry said a “10-second photo-op as part of a group of Indian businessmen did not amount to Nirav being part of any official delegation”, especially considering that the prime minister did not take businessmen along in official delegations abroad. 
 
 “There was another evening reception of Indian businessmen, where the PM was present to show support to Indian business,” an MEA source said. Sources in the Confederation of Indian Industry also said Nirav had been attending the annual retreat of the global elite in the Swiss ski resort on the invitation of   which hosts the event. 
 
 They also said the billionaire jeweller was not a member of the   but was accommodated in the group photo since he was “hanging around there”.
