CHENNAI: Commuters on Anna Salai were struck with panic on Friday afternoon after news spread about a road cave-in of around 10 feet long near the   hotel. However, a spokesperman of Chennai   Rail Ltd ( ) debunked the initial reports, stating that it was not a cave-in but only a portion of the road where metro work was underway.

 “It is not a cave-in. We were broadening the road after removing the barricade. This is being done till Thousand Lights junction. Seeing that portion of the broken road caused some panic,” the CMRL spokesperson said.
 
 The CMRL managing director visited the spot after TV channels beamed the images. He was quoted by a news agency that the reasons behind the incident could only be determined after examination.
 
 In the melee, traffic police diverted vehicles for a while to avoid congestion. On November 19 last year, there was a cave-in near the DMS subway and the crater’s size was increasing on the road.
 
 The incident had happened close to the location under which the Teynampet metro station is being built. An autorickshaw’s wheel was stuck in the crater at that time. Metro rail officials rushed to the spot and had rectified the crater.
 
 On April 9, there was a major cave-in on Anna Salai near the   in which an MTC bus and a car were trapped. At least 35 passengers were on the bus. They were safely evacuated.
