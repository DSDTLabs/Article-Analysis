PATNA: A large number of Muslims from Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha and West Bengal are likely to attend the ‘Deen Bachao, Desh Bachao’ meet at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on April 15. 

 The conference is being organized by   under the banner of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB). “Nearly five lakh people are expected to turn up from the four states. Both Muslim as well as non-Muslim speakers have been invited for the event. The main purpose of the conference is to discuss the deteriorating social situation in the country. Representatives of various non-government organizations and religious leaders have been invited to the conference,” said Maulana Anisur Rahman  , general secretary of Imarat Shariah.
 
 Speaking at Imarat Shariah in Phulwarisharif area on Wednesday about the upcoming meet, Quasmi said it would be open for all as the problems relate not only to Muslims but the entire citizenry.
 
 “Cases of corruption and crime against women are on the rise. The country is being divided in the name of religion. The government is also creating laws that are not allowing people to follow their religion properly,” Quasmi said.
 
 More than 1,000 representatives from various religious and social organizations, including AIMPLB general secretary Maulana Wali Rahmani, were present on Wednesday.
