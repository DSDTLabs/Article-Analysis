CHANDIGARH: It was tough for 34-year-old Harjeet Kaur to even sit without feeling breathless. Oxygen cylinder was her only hope to battle interstitial lung disease — an end-stage problem –– for the past five years. But after her   at PGIMER on Tuesday, Harjeet Kaur, a resident of Sangrur in Punjab, is without any breathing support for the first since she was diagnosed with the disease.

 According to her family, the donor –– a 22-year-old youth of Moga who died in an accident –– gave her a new lease of life.
 
 “My wife spoke to me and was feeling better after the transplant. It is due to the donor’s family that she can live a quality life,” said Prithpal Singh, husband of the lung recipient.
 
 Except the heart, all organs of the deceased were retrieved on Tuesday. “His eyes, lungs, two kidneys and liver have been transplanted. The heart was not found suitable for the transplant,” said Dr  , nodal officer, Regional Organ and  , PGIMER.
 
 Harjeet’s condition had deteriorated in the past two months. “She has been coming to PGI for her treatment. The doctors explained her about the complications. Due to her health problem, she cannot do any routine work at home. We had been waiting for the transplant, hoping to see her fit and fine one day,” said Prithpal.
 
 The recipient is admitted to the ICU of the advanced cardiac centre and will stay there for a week. “We will monitor the patient for a month or so. Put on immunosuppressors drugs, these patients are at risk of catching the slightest of infection. There is a possibility of organ rejection too. So, these patients need to be monitored all the time,” said Dr  , department of pulmonary medicine, PGIMER.
