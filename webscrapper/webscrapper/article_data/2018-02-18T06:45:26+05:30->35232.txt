CHENNAI:  's green lungs are being turned into concrete in the name of development.

 On Saturday, it was the turn of a huge banyan tree, believed to be more than 100 years old, to be cut. An electric saw was used to chop off its branches, with the trunk to be felled soon.
 
  “There are at least 20 trees of the same age and we fear that many of them will also be chopped,” said a student. 
 
 Nearly 10 trees on the campus have been brought down since Friday, say students. The trees are being cut to enable the construction of a new three-storeyed building to house the geology, medical physics and English departments.
 
 There were four strees standing behind the Knowledge Park building about a week ago but they have all been axed, say students. “Earlier, the building was not visible to visitors as it was shielded by the trees. Now, the building is claerly visible,” said the student.
 
 The university has identified at least half a dozen places from where trees will be knocked down to take up the construction of new buildings. Last year too, several trees were cleared for the construction of the office of the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management. 
 
 Anna University is home to more than 20 species of trees including some rare and exotic species, say researchers. “The campus already lost a sizable number of trees during cyclone Vardah. Now, the management is on a tree-cutting spree,” lamented another student.
 
 Civil engineering department professor and estate officer V K Stalin said a couple of trees in the building plan area were being cut but new saplings would be planted in another area to compensate for the loss. Some other trees would be transplanted elsewhere, he added. 
 
 When contacted by TOI, higher education secretary   said he was not aware of the cutting of trees on the Anna University campus.
