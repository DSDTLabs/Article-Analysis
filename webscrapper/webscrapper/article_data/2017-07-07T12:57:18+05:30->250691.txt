STRâ€™s recent release   received a lot of flak from the critics and public. Now we hear that   and his father   are keen to revive his project,  .

 Kettavan is a dream project of STR, which was launched in 2007. At least 40 per cent of the film is completed and the footage is with the family. Reports are that TR is likely to use the salvageable footage and re-shoot the rest of the film. The movie will be directed by STR himself and has Namitha,   and Santhanam. STR plays a baddie in the film. It has been ten years since the project started.
