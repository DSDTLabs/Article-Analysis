Actress   and her fiancé   are all set to dance to match steps on celeb dance reality show '  Baliye'. Brent, who was in the US sorting out his Indian visa, received a grand welcome by   and her close friends a couple of days ago when he landed in India. He permanently moved to India six months ago for his lady love. From being a weapons instructor, business man and a yogi, Brent, who’s only seen a handful of Hindi films, will be taking a plunge into Bollywood dancing with the reality show.

 Says Aashka, “Ever since I met Brent, life has been a constant discovery of various things. From the time Brent courageously moved to India by wrapping up his entire life, friends and work just to be with me, this has been one big beautiful love story. When 'Nach' happened, it was another pretty feather to our story — to put our love story out on a stage meant for lovers. We realised we have a chance to make so many people believe that love exists in all beautiful ways, if you give it a chance.”
 
 The couple plan to tie the knot by the end of this year.
