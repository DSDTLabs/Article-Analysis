GURUGRAM: A woman sub-inspector ( ) of Sohna City police station was booked and subsequently   on Friday for allegedly detaining a   boy and then demanding Rs 30,000 for his release.

 Gurugarm commissioner of police Sandeep Khirwar ordered an FIR under sections 7 and 13(1)A of the Prevention of Corruption Act against SI Sunita after the boy’s father lodged a complaint with the city’s top cop.
 
 SHO inspector Ram Kumar was also shifted in the day with inspector Mukesh Kumar taking charge of Sohna City police station with immediate effect. Though sources said Ram’s transfer was the fallout of the corruption case, DCP (south) Ashok Bakshi claimed it was routine.
 
 In his complaint, the boy’s father Rajender Singh, a resident of Dhunela village, claimed his 16-year-old son had gone to drop his daughter to school on a bike on Wednesday. In front of the school, his bike had collided with another motorcycle. After the accident, the two bikers — both apparently minors — got engaged in a bitter argument, which prompted one of the teachers at the school to call police. 
 
 Eventually, a police team from Sohna City police station came and took both the bikers to the police station.
 
 According to Singh, the two sides settled the matter amicably in the presence of the cops. “However, woman SI Sunita made my son to sit in the police station till 8pm. Later, she demanded Rs 30,000 for his release. I said I did not have so much money and gave her Rs 7,000. She let my son go but threatened to implicate him in a false case if I did not pay the remaining amount,” Singh alleged.
 
 “We have registered an FIR against the sub-inspector following the complaint. But it is a matter of investigation and we are verifying the facts. Action will be taken as per the law,” DCP (south) Bakshi said.
 
 Asked about the SHO’s shifting, Bakshi said Ram’s transfer was due and he was only relived (from the charge of the police station) on Friday.
