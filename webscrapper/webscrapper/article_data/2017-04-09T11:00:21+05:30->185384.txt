PATNA: Former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi on Saturday said he would approach central agencies, including the Indian Railways, seeking a probe into the transfer of two hotels of the railways to a private hospitality group 12 years ago when RJD chief Lalu Prasad was the railway minister.

 Alleging that the hospitality group in lieu of the hotels gave two acres of land at Saguna Mor in Patna to a firm patronised by Lalu, Modi said it was this land on which a Rs 500-crore mall was coming up. 
 
 “I will petition the Railways, the CBI, income tax department and the enforcement directorate and urge them to probe the land deal that benefited Lalu, his wife   and their sons Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and   who are ministers in the   government,” Modi said.
