Bengaluru: The tourism department is all set to revive the   luxury train by making it affordable for the middle class.

 Replying to a question by   (JDS), in the legislative council on Monday on the tourism department’s initiatives for increasing tourism in the state, minister   said the department is making the Golden   affordable. “The department wants to introduce weekend packages at an affordable rate,” he added.
 
 Expanding on the proposal outside the House,   said the department was looking at rates between Rs 30,000 and Rs 35,000 per person. The department was looking at two routes for the weekend hauls, including one to Hampi. The trains will leave Bengaluru on Friday night and come back on Sunday late night or Monday morning.
 
 “If you consider the rates at any three- or four-star hotel, a person will pay between Rs 8,000 and Rs 9,000 just for the stay. We’re offering two days and three nights, inclusive of accommodation and three meals a day,” he said.
 
 Kharge said more than the pricing, the department will sell the experience. The other options being explored are opening the Golden Chariot for corporate retreats and weddings. “We’re also exploring the possibilities of corporates and company offsites,” he minister added.
 
 The department is trying to tie up with wedding planners. “The large-scale advertising and use of travel bloggers have greatly assisted in selling the Chariot outside the country. We now plan to concentrate within the nation as well,” he added.
 
 At present, the Chariot rates are Rs 1.82 lakh per person for seven nights. Kharge said the Chariot has been doing well on occupancy though it’s incurring losses. It sold 53 of the 74 seats available on its last run.
