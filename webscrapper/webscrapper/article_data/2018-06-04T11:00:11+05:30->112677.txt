KOCHI: Women coming to the city have been often forced to hold urine for hours due to lack of public toilets in Kochi. 

 
 But the problem faced by women are likely to be resolved with the   ( ) planning to launch 'She Toilets' with the support of shops and establishments in Ernakulam.
 
 As per the project, women will be allowed to use toilets in shops.
 
 "Already 200 merchants have expressed their willingness to provide toilet facility in their shops to all women coming to the city. There are public toilets like bio-toilets in some parts of the city. But they are not functional. We are launching the project only in shops where at least four women are working and toilets are clean," said   A M, DLSA secretary.
 
 The authority will display a sign in front of shops informing of the toilet facility. Some shops will also provide feeding facility by allotting a special room to mothers.
 
 "Though local bodies and other agencies had installed toilets in different parts of the city, many are dysfunctional. To ensure that the DLSA project continues without any hurdle, we will follow it up regularly," said Basheer.
 
 Meanwhile, DLSA will hold an adalat for transgenders in the district at ADR centre in Kaloor on Monday. An awareness class on the project of literacy mission for transgenders will also be held at the venue.
