 In an interview, the 72-year-old   legend however, said that it is getting more challenging for him to keep playing. 
 
 "I am still going to work. I am going to do a show at   (British Summer Time Festival) in July. 
 
 "The only thing I am concerned with now is I am going deaf, I've got tinnitus, my hands just about work. I mean, I am hoping people will come along and see me, me more than I am a curiosity. I know that is part of it, because it's amazing to myself that I am still here," Clapton said. 
 
 The   hitmaker, who was speaking at the promotion of his documentary,  , said watching the film is a tough experience for him. 
 
 "It's difficult to sit through because it goes on so long about the difficult part of my life. 
 
 "I think it's important for people to see that there is a happy ending, it's like a redemption concept. If you are going to go and see it, be prepared for a heavy ride," he said.
