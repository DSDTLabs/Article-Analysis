 is the latest singer to transition into acting. The popular Delhi-based   recently made his acting debut with the film Shaadi Teri Bajayenge Hum Band. The movie was shot completely in Delhi and had Dilbagh play a Delhi boy. The singer says, "It was easy for me to shoot as I play a Delhi boy, just the way I am. I was born and brought up in Delhi. Meri padhai yahin hui, sab music yahin seekha hai. So, it came naturally to me."

 The film was shot across in Delhi in locations like Rajouri Garden, Dwarka, Connaught Place, and on NH48 close to Gurgaon. Talking about his experience of shooting in Delhi, Dilbagh shares, "There was never any problem with the crowd, which the crew was fearing. If you meet fans with love, they will respect you and give you your space too. Main sabse pyaar se mila toh unn sabne bhi enjoy kiya shoot par. Koi problem nahi hui kabhi."
 
 Having shot in Delhi now, Dilbagh rubbishes the claims that the city is not good for shooting. He tells us, "I don’t agree with the statement that Delhi is not good for shooting. I feel that Delhi is very good for shooting. If you go to Mumbai or any such place, everything there seems artificial. They create   and places for you. Here, you don’t have to create anything. Delhi already has a lot of places where you can shoot, be it the Hanuman statue (at  ), the Metro or CP’s Inner Circle. You get ready-made locations here. We shot the title track of our movie at a wedding venue near Raja Garden. The editors of the movie asked if this was a set, as it looked like something from a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film. We told them it is a real location from Delhi and they were surprised."
