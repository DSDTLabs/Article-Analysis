Vanita Chandra is a professor of English at  . She was one of the organisers of the Cultures of Protest event, for which JNU student leaders Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid Shora had been invited. After it was cancelled and protests broke out,   named Chandra and another professor, Mukul Manglik, in a police complaint filed on Wednesday, allegedly as they could be heard raising controversial slogans in a video clip. However, no FIR has been lodged, and Chandra denies shouting any slogans, as claimed.

 Claiming that the assaults did not cow down the supporters of the Ramjas College event, Chandra emphasised, “Yes, the ABVP goons attacked us, and yes, they threw stones through the windows of the conference hall, and yes, they got the police and the administration to cancel the talks of Umar and Shehla.”
 
 She said the students were not going to capitulate so easily, so soon. Saying that the small group of 40 students were later joined by an increasing number through the day, she pointed out, “When the ABVP goons became insanely violent, the girls came to the front line. When bricks came flying through the windows, they shouted out to us to duck and move away from windows.”
