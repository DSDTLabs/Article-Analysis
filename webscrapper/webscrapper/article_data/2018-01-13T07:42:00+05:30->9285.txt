CHANDIGARH: A joint SAD-BJP delegation, on Thursday, met   governor V P Singh Badnore, urging him to direct the state   government to implement a complete Rs 90,000 crore farm   for all farmers, including farm labourers and dalits.

 The delegation headed by SAD president   and   president   also urged the governor to get a sitting SC judge to inquire into cases of sacrilege reported during the regime of both the SAD and Congress. The delegation also asked the governor to direct the state government to register a criminal case against   leader Harinderpal Singh Mann for instigating Congress workers to murder their Akali counterparts. They went on to urge the governor to withdraw assent to Mannâ€™s appointment as member of the syndicate of Punjabi University, Patiala. 
 
 The joint delegation brought to the notice of the governor the promise made by chief minister Captain   that all loans taken from banks and private money lenders would be waived off. Badal said small farmers who incurred a loan of more than Rs 2 lakh and marginal farmers with 2.5 acres of land were kept out of the scheme.
 
 They told the governor that farmers were increasingly committing suicide due to the flawed nature of the farm loan waiver scheme and the number of such cases has reached 350. According to the memorandum, the inquiry into sacrilege cases was being conducted by Justice Ranjit Singh (retired) who, they alleged, had always worked to further the interests of the Congress party and discriminated against the SAD. It said the level of collusion between the commission and the government was such that even before it submitted its report, its contents had been prejudged by both the chief minister and state Congress president Sunil Jakhar.
