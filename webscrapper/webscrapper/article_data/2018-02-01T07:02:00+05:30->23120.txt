GURUGRAM: The first GMDA   held on Wednesday came under criticism over the way it was organised. Even   expressed his displeasure and pulled up officials, asking them to put up a better show next time. To begin with, the media was barred from covering the meeting and journalists were kept waiting for almost three hours outside the venue. Besides, some district   too were not allowed to enter the meeting room due to “lack of space’. The meeting was held in conference hall of newly constructed PWD rest house near Rajiv Chowk, which could accommodate around 50 people.
