Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) opposition leader has demanded better safety measures at ponds in the city. The demand was made in wake of the death of a 12-year-old boy in the Kotar Talavdi pond in the Manjalpur area of the city on Tuesday.

 The civic body is conducting beautification of the pond where the incident took place. Congress councillor and former VMC opposition leader Chirag Zaveri said that there were dwellings around several ponds and their safety should be ensured. TNN
