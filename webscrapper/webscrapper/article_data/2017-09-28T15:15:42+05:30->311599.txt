Last week, it was announced that  , the leading lady of the first two 'Terminator' movies, will be returning to the franchise for the 2019 reboot.

  
  
 But, how did Cameron convinced his ex-wife Hamilton to join the movie? And the answer is apparently 'very sensitively'. The veteran director admitted he was nervous about asking the actress to return to the franchise. "I was terrified. It took me a week just to get up the nerve. No, that's not true. Linda and I have a great relationship," said Cameron.
 
 The 'Avatar' helmer revealed that he presented an idea to Hamilton as an opportunity to remind audiences what they were missing. He noted, "I called her up, and I said: 'Look, we could rest on our laurels. It's ours to lose, in a sense. We created this thing several decades ago. But, here's what can be really cool. You can come back and show everybody how it's done. Because in my mind, it hasn't been done a whole lot since the way she did it back in '91."
 
 The 'Dante's Peak' star played Connor in 1984's The 'Terminator' and 1991's 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'.  , who is going to helm the reboot, also shared that it would make a great statement to show Hamilton as a seasoned warrior.
 
 "There are certainly plenty of 50-, 60-, 70-something guys out there that just keep cranking along doing action movies and killing bad guys left and right. But there isn't an example of that for women, and I think there should be," explained Miller.
 
 Cameron, who is producing the film with Skydance, are treating the new movie as a direct sequel to 'Judgment Day'.
