AHMEDABAD: According to rough estimates by   (AFES) officials, there are 7,000   which are used as residences, especially in the walled city areas and a number of  , which pose a serious threat.

 “The incident should serve as a reminder to start a drive to identify establishments using LPG cylinders and inflammable goods. The biggest issue is the lack of ventilation. As observed on Tuesday, such places don’t have vents for smoke to escape. Most deaths in fires don’t occur due to burns but due to asphyxiation,” said an AFES official.
 
 Officials also added that there is a need to look at buildings with no fire safety measures in place. Like Vardaan Tower, where the fire hydrant was encroached on by illegal construction and had to be broken by AMC authorities, a number of buildings have no contingency provisions despite a rise in fires in high-rises in recent times.
 
 AFES officials said that an electric mains line for Tower A of   passed just behind the shop. If the fire spread to the back of the shop, it could have resulted in a bigger fire with flames spreading to the residential block above the shop. 
 
 One of the residences in the tower reported a minor fire on Tuesday evening. Officials however said it was not connected to the Tuesday morning’s incident.
