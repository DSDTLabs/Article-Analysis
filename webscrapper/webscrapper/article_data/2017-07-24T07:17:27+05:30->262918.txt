BENGALURU: Almost a decade after it was first proposed, the steel flyover along   took another step towards becoming a reality with the BBMP calling for fresh tenders last week.

 The fresh tender was necessitated as the previous contractor's estimate surpassed the budgeted estimate.The detailed project report for the 2.2-km steel bridge between   and Minerva Circle was prepared in 2009 itself.
 
 Mayor   said the last tender taken in 2015-16 proved unfeasible due to rising costs. “ A company called Simplex had been awarded the tender. However, their estimated expenditure was 48% more than the estimated Rs 135 crore set aside for the project. The cabinet only gives permission for going 20% above the budget.That is why we have called for tenders again a week ago and the process will end in 21 days,“ she said.
 
 Padmavathi said work will commence once the process of receiving applications, evaluation and approval is complete. “It could take three to four months for it to get off the ground,“ she added.
 
 “This is a major public work which is being funded by the state government's Nagarothana Scheme.It is an ambitious signal-free corridor which will cover six to seven junctions and enable two-way movement of traffic,“ she added.
 
 According to her, heritage buildings along JC Road like the BBMP head office,   and Ravindra Kalaskshetra won't be affected by the construction of the structure. The bridge is expected to ease congestion on KR Market, RV Road and JC Road and at Hudson Circle. It is expected to cut travel time by approximately 25 minutes.
 
 Adding that congestion in the morning and evening hours were causing problems for commuters along the stretch, the mayor claimed the flyover will be beneficial to all stakeholders.
