GANDHINAGAR:   has retained the same number of seats - 47 out of 75 - in   municipal polls as it had won five years back in 2013, with the party winning 27 of the 28 seats in Prime Minister  's home town Vadnagar in Mehsana district. Congress has improved its tally from eight municipalities to 16. Voting for the 75 municipalities was held last Saturday and the results were declared on Monday.

 
 State election commissioner Varesh Sinha said, "Out of 75 municipalities, BJP has won 47, Congress 16, NCP one and BSP one. There is no clear mandate in six municipalities, while independents have the edge in four. Of total 2,060 municipal councillor seats, BJP won 1,167, Congress 630, BSP 15, NCP 28, and other parties won 18. Independents won 202 seats."
 
 Both parties have reasons to rejoice and both claim that they will form the bodies in 10 municipalities where there is no clear mandate as there are many Independent winners.
 
 Gujarat BJP was elated with the party's performance in Vadnagar. "We have won 47 of 75 municipalities, which is almost the same performance as of 2013. But we have won municipalities in 41 assembly constituencies where Congress won in the December 2017 assembly elections. This shows that people have lost confidence in Congress within just two months," Gujarat BJP chief Jitu Vaghani said.
