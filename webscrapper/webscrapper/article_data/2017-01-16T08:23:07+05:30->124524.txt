NEW DELHI: A deep-rooted inferiority complex followed by a troubled past is a common cause behind paedophilia, which can be treated through counselling. However, mental health experts said that in the case of  , the paedophile nabbed by  , a psychological analysis is essential as his behaviour did not seem abnormal.

 Doctors said that paedophiles can come from all walks of life and target helpless and vulnerable people, mostly children under the age of 12. Most of them have a history of being sexually abused because of which they lose control of differentiating between right and wrong. They feel it is okay to do it just because it has happened to them. “There is a higher chance of paedophiles targeting a child known to them, mostly relatives or neighbours,” said mental health expert Avdesh Sharma.
 
 Recalling the Nirbhaya case, criminal psychologist Jayanti Dutta said that one of the accused had been sexually abused thrice when he was a child.
 
 In Rastogi’s case, doctors said that sexually abusing minor girls helped him vent out his desires, which may have remained unfulfilled. “All paedophiles have a deep-rooted inferiority complex. Their energies are not channelised properly, so they manifest violence against children. Nowadays, this is happening everywhere,” Dutta said.
 
 Sharma said anyone, sometimes the least expected person, from any class or socio-economic status and educational background can turn out to being a paedophile. “Children have little knowledge about sexual abuse, so they end up falling prey to such men and women,” he said.
 
 Such people have a history of watching pornographic websites and putting in hours of planning behind attacking a child. “Sometimes, the person might target the same child repeatedly if they feel that he or she is okay with what they are doing,” Sharma said.
