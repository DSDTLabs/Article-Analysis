CHANDIGARH: Punjab rural development and panchayat minister   on Friday ordered transfer of the deputy director posted in Mohali to Nabha after receiving an   complaint against him from women employees. 

 TOI had on Thursday reported at least five women employees had complained to the minister alleging sexual harassment by the deputy director posted in the Vikas Bhawan at Mohali. The accused officer was transferred to Mohali in July last year.
 
 Panchayat department principal secretary   confirmed, “The minister has ordered transfer of the deputy director to Nabha. The decision was taken after the minister himself heard the complainants today.” 
 
 Asked whether any departmental inquiry has been ordered against the officer, Verma said joint development commissioner Tanu Kashyap had also given personal hearing to the aggrieved complainants on Friday. “Complainants have again been called on Monday to submit their grievances in writing. If someone brings some concrete material, we can then take effective action after examining it,” said Verma. He added that the department had transferred the deputy director pending hearing against him so as to avoid any interference in the process.
 
 The complainants have alleged that the deputy director was in the habit of “such verbal and physical conduct with them which is of sexual nature”. Allegations have also been made that the officer also passes unwarranted comments of ‘double meaning’ to them and harasses them.
