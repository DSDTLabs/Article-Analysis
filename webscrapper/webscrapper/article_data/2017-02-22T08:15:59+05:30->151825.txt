NEW DELHI: A day after two   were sexually assaulted by two juveniles in  , locals there staged a protest, demanding better sanitation. 

 For a locality of over 500 houses, there are only three toilets. People are charged Rs 2 for every visit to the loo. As a result, many people go for open defecation. The two girls were assaulted when they had gone out to answer nature’s call. 
 
 But minutes before this attack, the alleged main culprit had attacked a woman. “I was alone at home when the man just walked into my house, hurling abuses at me. I shouted at him and told him to leave, but he slapped me and smashed the left side of my face against the floor. Then he dragged me towards a sofa. All this while, he kept telling me that he had seen me   in the open and wanted to marry me. I could no longer respond as he had gagged me by then,” the woman said. 
 
 After 10 minutes of horror, the woman said, she managed to escape from the assailant’s clutches and run outside, calling out for help. The youth had scampered away by then. 
 
 He went straight to the area where women and children go to answer nature’s call. There, he spotted the two children aged five and nine and lured them to his house with the promise of giving them chocolates. At his house, he and his friend sexually abused the children. 
 
 “This is the first time that something so heinous has happened here. All of us here are poor, and either work as household helps or labourers. The three toilets are not free for use. How do we spend money on that every day?” said a woman resident of the area who works as a maid. 
 
 Another woman said it was humiliating to defecate in the open, especially in that area as there’s ongoing construction nearby and workers there stare at them. “We women either go there before sunrise or after sunset. But after this incident, we are too scared to do even that,” she added.
