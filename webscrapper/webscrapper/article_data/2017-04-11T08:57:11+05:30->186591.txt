AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday decided to quash FIRs registered by   police against some restaurant owners who had dared to resist police orders for free food. To shame them, Palitana police had handcuffed and paraded them in town.

 After the eateries refused to give food free to police, 10 persons, including women, of an extended family, which runs restaurants and a cloth shop in Palitana town of   district were booked by Palitana police.
 
 Cops first slapped charges of dacoity on them and registered an FIR accusing them of having robbed cash from a nearby shop. Some male members of the family were later booked for assault on their police escort on their way to court.
 
 They were handcuffed and paraded through town.
 
 All accused persons approached the HC and submitted that their restaurants are close to the police station. Cops used to order food regularly for accused persons kept in lock-up. They were also supposed to supply free food for police parties. Even if the police paid something on rare occasions, the sums were paltry. Unable to bear losses, they stopped giving food and asked for payments. Immediately, the police framed them in false cases, submitted the petitioners.
 
 During hearing,   observed that the accusations did not spell out charges of dacoity at all. The judge, however, is yet to pass a detailed order in both the matters.
