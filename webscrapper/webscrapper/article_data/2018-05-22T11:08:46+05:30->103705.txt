GREATER NOIDA: A day after an alleged shooter associated with the dreaded   gang was nabbed in a shootout, the police have confirmed that he and three other youths were involved in planning the murder of Swami Chakrapani, national president of All India Hindu Mahasabha. Chakrapani had bought underworld don Dawood Ibrahim’s car for Rs 32,000 at an auction in Mumbai in 2015 and burnt it in  . 

 
 The police also released the criminal history of the accused, Manish, who has at least 25 cases of loot registered against him in Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad.
 
 Earlier, the Greater Noida police had sent a letter to the special cell of Delhi Police to share details of the cases lodged against him in Delhi so that his activities can be checked and his involvement with the gang be established.
 
 Pramod Kushwaha, DCP, Special Cell, Delhi Police told TOI that Manish was indeed the one arrested by the cell in June 2016 along with the three other youths - Junaid Chaudhary, Roger Robinson and Yunus. However, out of four, it was Junaid who was in touch with Chhota Shakeel’s gang.
 
 “The other three associated knew about this connection. They are on bail. Our case is under trial in court,” he said. While the four youths were arrested for planning the murder of Chakrapani, reports emerging from the Special Cell had also pointed out that the youths also had don Chhota Rajan—lodged in Tihar Jail—as their target.
 
 SSP   told TOI that Manish had threatened one Brij Pal Rathi, a contractor who owns an office in Amrapali Leisure Valley in Greater Noida West.
 
 Manish, who was shot at his leg by police on Sunday, was discharged from the hospital and produced before a district court on Monday.
