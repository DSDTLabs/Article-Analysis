NEW DELHI: On Tuesday, equity markets got off to a volatile spell of trading in the morning as   swung 150 points within the initial fifteen minutes after the market opened, even as the BSE index hit another fresh high of 34,487.52.

 Sensex opened with a jump of 78.82 points on 34,431.61 while the broader 50-share NSE   went up by 21.50 points to start trading on 10,645.10.
 
 Even as the markets pared after the initial surge and the gains flattened out, benchmark indices managed to stay above the key psychological marks and thus Nifty is comfortably placed above the resistance at 10,600-mark.
 
  Auto, metal and PSU bank stocks were gaining in early trade while   took a beating.
