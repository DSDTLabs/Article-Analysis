PATNA: Altogether 1,854 sportspersons belonging to 34 teams from across the country are participating in the 65th All India Police Championship, which was inaugurated by CM Nitish Kumar at the Mithilesh Stadium here on Friday. 

 Apart from police teams of several states, sportsmen of Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Railway Protection Force and Sashastra Seema Bal are participating in the five-day event. At least 317 medals are up for grabs by the winners of wrestling, weightlifting, boxing and kabaddi contests.
 
 The CM on the occasion also felicitated probationer IPS officer Manjeet Shivram and   Military Police (BMP)’s SI Gul Hasan for winning gold and bronze medals respectively at the All India Police Equestrian Championship held in Hyderabad recently.
 
 Addressing the function, the CM underlined the importance of sports among police personnel and also referred to the government’s efforts to develop infrastructure for sports in the state.
 
 “The state DGP should try to organise at least one national-level police championship in Bihar every year. The state government will readily provide necessary help for it,” the CM said.
 
 In his address, DGP P K Thakur said Bihar successfully organised several national-level police championships earlier too. He recalled the names of Bihar Police’s SI Uma Singh, havildar Anil Singh and constable Mukesh Kumar who have won medals at international level.
 
 “Such events play a significant role in increasing coordination among forces of different states, which helps handle organised crime as its network is spread beyond state boundaries,” Thakur said, adding the state government has approved Rs 22 crore for an indoor stadium inside the Mithilesh Stadium, which is located on the BMP-5 premises.
 
 Bihar Police Gurkha Vahini’s trained commandos presented ‘Khukhri Drill’ and also displayed their martial arts with ‘khukhri’ at the inaugurale ceremony.
