PANAJI: Goa's beaches, which attract a million tourists every year, are gradually reducing with erosion gnawing away nearly one-fourth of the state's coastline. Around 25km of the 105km of the coastline has been severely damaged by erosion due to natural as well as human factors, water resources department has said in its latest report. 

  The department's report paints a very bleak picture of the state's coastline with 24% being severely damaged and around 30% suffering moderate damages in small patches. 
 
 The coastal belt in Bardez taluka has suffered the maximum damage with more than 7km of the coast witnessing erosion. It was followed by Salcete with over 5km of the coastline vanishing, while Canacona and Pernem lost 4km and 3km of the beach stretch, respectively, the report said.
 
  Authorities have also said that although plans are ready on paper, little is allowed to be executed due to obstruction from locals and other bodies.
