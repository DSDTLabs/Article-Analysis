MUMBAI: The  , a Mumbai-based NGO working in the fields of disability and education, will organise a four pit-stop bike rally at 7.00am on Republic Day. The participants are members of a group of   bikers named HOGS (Harley Davidson Owners' Group). They will ride from Bandra to Mahalaxmi.

 Most of them are senior businessmen, professionals including doctors and corporate executives who love their bikes. Around 50 members of HOG will join the rally, most of them aged between 35-50. ``After all it is only when you are a little older and have saved some money that you can afford a Harley, isn't it?'' laughed   trustee Rajiv Mehta. ``And when you zip across the streets, all heads turn and wonder what that phenomenon was that just went by.''
 
 The bikers will head from Bandra at 7.00am for their first pit-stop which is NCPA. The next station for the rally is   followed by   and then Mahalaxmi along Worli Seaface. They will wear Ratna Nidhi T-Shirts and carry flags about its Jaipur Foot initiative. They will visit the NGO's Mahalaxmi centre for a flag hoisting ceremony and also distribute mobility equipment and aids to 20-odd recipients. ``They have already bonded with the cause. That is the larger aim after all. Imagine the satisfaction of watching a handicapped person come crawling because he cannot walk, and return standing tall on his artificial legs within the span of one hour. The bikers will see for themselves tomorrow but they are already impressed.''
 
 Ratna Nidhi was established in 1990 by Mahendra Mehta. From a small family institution it has grown rapidly. Its projects cover a wide range of activities across India, Afghanistan, Sudan, Kenya and Burundi.
