 The Haryana-Delhi border had heavy deployment of police and paramillitary forces to ensure the smooth flow of traffic. Each vehicle entering Delhi was carefully scanned.
 
 Most of the farmers were not allowed to come out on roads and contained within the towns and cities of Haryana. In Radaur, the farmers laid siege to the road after police stopped them from moving further. Police resorted to use of force to disperse them.
 
 In Hisar, farmers and anganwadi workers blocked the entry and exit gates of the Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University (CCSHAU) where Dhankar had gone to chair an event. Police had a tough time in dispersing the agitators who had reached the venue with black flags.
 
 Meanwhile,   leaders ex-CM Bhupinder Hooda and party spokesperson   condemned the lathicharge on farmers.
 
 “This is really shocking that the government, which came to power by promising moon to the farmers, has now gifted them with lathis and jail bars. BJP’s time of befooling the farmers and the poor is over. Such kind of incidents are always condemned. The government should dissolve the assembly on moral grounds now,” said Hooda.
 
 Surjewala termed the incident as unfortunate. “What too talk of providing the input cost, this government has just betrayed the farmers. Except for lathis and false cases, what else this government has to show as contribution towards farmers’ cause,” he said.
