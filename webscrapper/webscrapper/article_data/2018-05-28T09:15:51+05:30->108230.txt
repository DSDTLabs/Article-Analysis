For many years, there have been whispers about   and  's son Abishek entering films. We were the first to report that Abishek has decided to follow on his legendary parents footsteps and is also becoming an actor.

 The muhurat of Abishek's debut film,  , was held this morning at a temple in Bengaluru's JP Nagar. And before the event, proud mother Sumalatha put up a sweet message for Abishek on social media, in which she sought blessings for him and hoped that we all shower the same love on him that we have on her and Ambareesh.
