District magistrate (DM) Rajiv Raushan was immediately informed. “The DM and other officers immediately rushed to the bank branch and the account had to be freezed for further transaction,” said a source adding, “It was during the course of investigation we came to know that altogether, Rs 24.15 lakh was withdrawn from the account on different dates. Three withdrawals were done on January 17 and one each on January 20 and January 22. But the sms landed only for the last withdrawal of around Rs 14 lakh. All amounts were withdrawn in Chennai,” said DPRO Deepak Chandra Deo.
