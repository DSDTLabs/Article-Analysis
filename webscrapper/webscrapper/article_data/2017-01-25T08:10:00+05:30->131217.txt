GURUGRAM: A two-day-long hearing on violence at the   plant in 2012, in progress at the   since Monday, saw a fresh twist. 

 Some witnesses failed to identify the accused while others who identified them failed to point out their role in the July 18, 2012 incident in which  , general manager (human resources) of the automotive major, was burnt to death after violence engulfed the car plant.
 
 Office facilities, security office and fire safety sections of the plant were gutted and over 100 injured in the violence. Soon after, Gurgaon police made 148 workers accused in the case, of whom, 138 are out on bail while the remainder are still in jail under trail. Besides, 546 employees were sacked by the company.
 
 Noted lawyers Rebecca John and   appeared on behalf of the accused workers during the two-day-long hearing, which continued from morning to evening on Monday and Tuesday in the court of district and sessions judge R P Goyal. The next hearing is scheduled for January 27. 
 
 Advocates Grover and John highlighted several loopholes in the police investigation. They pointed out before court that the statements of the accused were recorded seven days after the incident, while seizures of material from the site were recorded six days after the incident. They went on to argue that the victim had died from suffocation. 
 
 “There is no clear evidence to point to the cause of the fire [that killed Dev],” said Grover before court.
 
 “There is no proper evidence to support the case. The workers were framed. We hope all the accused workers will come out clean in the case,” said a member of the Maruti Suzuki Employee’s Union, adding that there are variations in the recorded statements of the witnesses.
