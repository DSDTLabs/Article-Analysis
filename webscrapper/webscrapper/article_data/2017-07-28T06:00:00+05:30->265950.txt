Darjeeling: Both GJM and GNLF made use of Sahid Divas on Thursday to restore morale that has started to wane even as the indefinite strike in the Hills entered its 44th day. While GNLF issued a veiled threat to the Centre, GJM announced a Gandhigiri programme. GJM, however, made it clear that the strike will continue at least till August 1 when the Gorkhaland Movement Coordination Committee meets in New Delhi.

 GNLF spokesperson Niraj Zimba said his party may agree to talk with the government provided the sole agenda of discussion is Gorkhaland. The GJM leadership refuted claim that party president Bimal Gurung is planning to travel to New Delhi, responding to feelers from the Centre. “Party general secretary Roshan Giri is in New Delhi and the news about our party president going there is baseless,” GJM CC member and legal adviser Tilak Chand Roka said.
 
 “The Centre’s apathy is only aggravating the situation in the Hills,” Zimba told a large gathering of GNLF workers.
