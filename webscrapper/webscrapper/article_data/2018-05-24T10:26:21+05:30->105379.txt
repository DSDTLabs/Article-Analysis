BENGALURU: For the second time in three days, parents of children who study in the three   institutions - Baldwin Boys' school, Baldwin Girls' school and   - in RR Nagar, gathered to protest against the management for forcing them to buy books at high rates from specific vendors and indulging in other 'malpractices' on Wednesday. 

 A group of about 100 parents met K Dayananda, Bengaluru Urban DC, who is also the chairperson of the   ( ) committee, and presented their complaints. The meeting was attended by VH Ashwath Narayan Gowda, DDPI, Bengaluru South, and lawyers who represented the school management. NL Karkare, archbishop and chairperson of Baldwin Institutions, defended the decision of the schools and alleged "old book vendors have instigated" the protests.
 
 "I have heard the woes of the parents and also the evidence to substantiate their allegations," said Dayananda. "But the school is yet to submit its version to DERA committee which they should have done prior to this meeting. I have given the management time till Saturday 11am and scheduled another meeting on that day to hear both parties." Dayananda will then submit his report to the department of public instruction and education department based on the hearing.
 
 A parent accused the school management of forcing parents to buy textbooks from specific vendors at a cost much higher than market prices. "Many books are from X-SEED publishers which does not follow ICSE/CBSE curricula. Why should we buy those books?" the parent asked. 
 
 All three institutions are scheduled to reopen for the new academic year on June 4 and over 40% parents are yet to buy the text books. Parents also reveal that when some of them asked for the TC (transfer certificate) of their children from the schools, they were asked to pay the fees of the first quarter for the TC to be issued.
