NEW DELHI:   have requested   Anil Baijal to make provisions in the   to provide relief to lakhs of city traders. A delegation of BJP MLAs led by Vijender Gupta, leader of opposition in Delhi assembly, met the LG on Wednesday. 

  "There is a lot of confusion with regard to payment of annual conversion charges. It must be clarified, as it is being misunderstood. We have requested the LG that the conversion charges should be collected only for a period of 10 years," said Gupta. 
 
  BJP reiterated its request for notification of 351 roads as commercial streets. "The corporations have sent the revised list of 351 roads to the Delhi government for notification," said Gupta. 
 
 BJP MLAs sought relaxation in penalty clause for non-payment of conversion and parking charges. "The payment for parking and conversion charges along with interest and penalty is so huge that shopkeepers can't pay. We have requested that the penalty on non-payment of conversion and parking charges for commercial units should be waived off," said Gupta.
