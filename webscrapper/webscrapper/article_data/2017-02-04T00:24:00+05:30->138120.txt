Navi Mumbai: The   of the   has entered the take-off stage with groundwork such as soil testing, demarcation, measurement and plotting set to be completed in around 10 days. This is in sync with the final deadline for financial bids to select a strategic partner ending February 13. 

 “There’s no delay, the survey work will get completed in eight to 10 days,” said  , MD of  , the nodal authority for the project. “We can wait for a month to reach the actual hill cutting,” he added.
 
 The pre-development work comprises around 50% of the total investment in phase I of the Rs 16,000-crore project. The pre-development work has three parcels. The first two parcels of the tender were finalised last year and works awarded, but the third parcel hit a hurdle. 
 
 After one extension because of less bidders and then cancellation of the bid last year due to demonetisation, this time there are six bidders. 
 
 Next week, Cidco will open the bids for finalising the party to grant the Rs 550 crore-work —the third parcel of the Rs 2,000-crore tender —for Ulwe hill cutting and river diversion work. 
 
 Cidco said 200 hectares of forest land requires the stage II forest clearance and the documentation process work was being done by Raigad collector. Although the forest land is in the core aeronautical area and clearance is required for both the hill cutting and river diversion, it could wait for some more time as the actual work in the forest land would take place in some time.
