THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state cabinet will provide a compensation of   and a government job for the wife of Sreejith who allegedly died due to custodial torture at Varappuzha. 

 Though the compensation has been sanctioned from the chief minister's relief fund, the cabinet decided to levy this amount from the accused police officers. The cabinet decided to provide a government job in the class-III category depending on the educational qualification of Sreejith's wife.
 
 Sreejith's death had put the government in a spot and the chief minister had to face a severe criticism as no minister or government official had visited Sreejith's family after the incident.
 
 The chief minister was not ready to issue a statement though his party's state secretary visited Sreejith's family. The state human rights commission too criticised the government over the incident.
