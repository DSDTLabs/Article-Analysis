Hyderabad: The school education department will conduct a meeting on Tuesday to finalise the report on   in the state. Members of the committee constituted by the government will consult all stakeholders for the last time and finalise the report before submitting it to the authorities. 

 The Independent Schools Managements Association expressed its apprehension over the meeting and sought one more week from the department. “We need to prepare for the meeting and need to have a discussion with all our association members. We feel this is very short notice for the meeting,” a letter submitted by the association on Monday. 
 
 But the Hyderabad School Parents Association urged for the meeting on Tuesday itself. “Each member and association has been given more than enough time,” their letter read.
