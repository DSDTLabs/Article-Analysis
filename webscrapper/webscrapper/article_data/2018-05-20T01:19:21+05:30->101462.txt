NOIDA: Buyers of   group’s various apartments, represented by the   (Nefowa), said on Friday that they are still waiting for clarity on payments related to flats where construction is 30 to 70% complete.

 
 While the   has, on May 17, indicated that buyers would now pay only when the entire project is 100% complete, the homebuyers demanded that the same should be notified on ground to all agencies for implementation.
 
 “For some apartments, 90% payments are given, for others 30% to 70% payments are done. Should buyers now stop all payments and hold back cheques? What if the builder later makes us defaulters? A proper clarity needs to be brought in this matter, possibly in the form of a public notice,” Shweta Bharti, general secretary, Nefowa said.
 
 Nefowa represents 2,200 buyers of various apartments of Amrapali. The group has sold 40,000 flats of which it presently claims to have only 25,000 left to handover. Almost all buyers had individually or in small collectives, approached the apex court against the builder with charges of delay and non-delivery of apartments.
 
 “It is a victory for the buyers that a resolution has finally been made by the courts after an eight month-long struggle. However, the actual resolution would be when the buyers finally get their apartments,”  , a buyer from Amrapali Centurion, who was present at the Supreme Court hearing, said.
 
 “We are at present working on exact data on the incomplete flats which was collected from the ground via videography. Once the completion work starts, we will be monitoring the activity closely to see that the quality of construction is not compromised for the sake of deadline pressures,” Abhishek Kumar, president, Nefowa, said.
 
 The Supreme Court has allowed Amrapali to get a co-developer on board for completion of the projects. It has also asked the builder to submit Rs 250 crore by June 15 as a security deposit with the court’s treasury.
