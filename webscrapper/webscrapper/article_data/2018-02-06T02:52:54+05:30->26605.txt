NEW DELHI: After two years delay,   and   metro stations will finally get   this month.

  Rail Corporation (DMRC) had planned to install PSGs — a barrier between the platforms and tracks with synchronised gates that open and close with the train doors — at six stations on the Yellow Line (Samaypur Badli-HUDA City Centre). Though the gates were expected to become operational by 2016 at Kashmere Gate, Chandni Chowk, Chawri Bazar, New Delhi, Rajiv Chowk and Central Secretariat, the inability to synchronise them with that of trains resulted in the delay.
 
 PSGs would help in better crowd management and also prevent suicides as the doors would be in synced with that of the trains and open simultaneously after the train stops. It would prevent anyone from jumping or falling on the tracks.
 
 Till recently, PSGs were only operational on the Airport Express Line, but the first section of the Magenta Line (between Botanical Garden and Kalkaji) also opened with these gates on December 25, 2017. Making these work at the already operational stations of Yellow Line proved to be a big challenge for DMRC, official said.
 
 “The PSGs could be installed only during non-revenue hours depending on the availability of blocks,” said Anuj Dayal, DMRC spokesperson.
 
 “A lot of integration was required with various components of metro operations for smooth installation of PSGs. The software was required to be upgraded for coordinated movement of the gates. The movement of commuters was also regularised during the day where PSG installation was in progress,” he said.
 
 Dayal added that the operation and installation of PSGs at New Delhi, Central Secretariat, Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate Metro stations would be done after examining the performance at Chandni Chowk and Chawri Bazar stations.
