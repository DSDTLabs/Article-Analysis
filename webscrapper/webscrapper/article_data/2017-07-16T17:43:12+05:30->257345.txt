INDORE: Union minister   on Saturday said that the BJP still supported senior state minister   after the election commission disqualified him for three years over charges of paid news.

 “The party was and will continue to support Mishra” Gehlot said.
 
 He however refused to comment further on questions of the election commission disqualifying Mishra, saying that the matter was still in court.
 
 “The law is doing its work. The matter is in court and any comment in this regard is not appropriate,” he said.
 
 Speaking about the explosives found in the Uttar Pradesh assembly and the Amarnath Yatra tragedy, Gehlot said the Centre and respective state governments have taken both issues seriously.
 
 “Soon after explosives were found in the state assembly, Uttar Pradesh chief minister   has reiterated his resolution that he will not tolerate people involved in such activities and will ensure the perpetrators receive strict punishment,” Gehlot said.
 
 The Union minister added that the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir has also taken the   very seriously.
 
 Gehlot praised initiatives taken by chief minister   to benefit farmers.
 
 “Chouhan is the only chief minister in the country who has implemented maximum schemes meant to benefit farmers, including distributing agriculture loans at zero percent interest and that to with a 10 per cent subsidy,” the minister said.
 
 During an event organised by IMC, Gehlot distributed prizes to persons of a lucky draw for paying water and property taxes in advance. “The locals too adopted sanitation and hygiene practices which helped Indore clinch the cleanest city award. By paying water and property tax in advance, they too have supported it,” Gehlot said.
