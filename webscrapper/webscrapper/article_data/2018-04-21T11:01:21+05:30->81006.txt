CHANDIGARH: The upper age limit for the post of GMCH director principal will be 58 years instead of 59 years from now. In a letter issued by the department of personnel and training (DoPT), upper age limit for the post of principal has been approved at 58 years. Also, the term of the director principal shall be five years. This new upper age limit qualifies Dr B S Chavan, officiating director principal, Dr  , head of the orthopaedic department and Dr Sukanya Mitra, head of the department of an aesthesia.

 The move comes almost a month after UPSC notified the upper age limit at 56 years. “We got the letter from the DoPT which has approved 58 years as the upper age limit,” said  , additional secretary health, UT. 
 
 With this, the process of selection of the new director principal at GMCH 32 will be initiated. “The post will be advertised by next week as the age limit has been made clear,” said a faculty member. 
 
 Recruitment rules of the medical college give preference to deputation. “In actual terms, deputation is for those who come from outside the institute. But after a department-wise seniority list was made, the seniormost faculty members from that department were called on deputation. This inbreeding cannot allow growth of the institute and does not follow recruitment rules,” said a senior administrative officer in the UT health department. 
 
  It might be recalled that almost a year ago, the UPSC conveyed to the UT health department to either reduce the tenure of the post of the director principal to three years if maximum age for eligibility is 59 years or make it five years if maximum age for eligibility is 57 years.
 
 Dr   completed his tenure as the director principal on April 23, 2017. Dr A K Janmeja was given additional charge as director principal. He retired on December end. Presently, Dr Chavan, being the senior most faculty member, has been holding the post of director-principal.
