CHENNAI: Citing the notification of a new set of rules to regularise   and layouts in Tamil Nadu, the   on Friday permitted the sale and resale of such sites on the condition that they are strictly in accordance with rules in a May 4 notification.

 A bench of Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar further clarified that registration of a plot in an unapproved area between the court’s blanket ban order of September 9, 2016 and another order of March 28, 2017, relaxing the ban, would be a nullity.
 
 The owners of 9,760 such properties registered them during the period. Similarly, all registrations between April 21, 2017, when the present first bench restored the ban order, and May 12, 2017, when the bench permitted their sale/resale, would also be nullities.
 
 Such registrations would violate court orders, and prima facie be a nullity in the eye of law, the bench said. Such properties should not be registered until further orders.
 
 The case started with a PIL by activist Elephant  , who sought to curb indiscriminate conversion of agricultural land into residential plots and the registration of such unapproved plots.
 
 On September 9, a ban by a bench headed by Chief Justice   restrained registration of   and buildings constructed on them. It was in force till March 28, when another bench relaxed the rules.
 
 The present bench on April 21 brought back the ban but revoked it on Friday in view of the government’s recent notification of rules pertaining to regularisation of unapproved layouts and plots and change of land use.
