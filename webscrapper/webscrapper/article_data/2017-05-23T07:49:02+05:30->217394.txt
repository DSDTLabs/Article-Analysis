HYDERABAD: The response from the people to the Single   pension scheme has shocked the  . At a time when it anticipated more than four lakh applications and arranged funds of over 4,000 crore to disburse a   of 1000 per woman, the response has puzzled officials. The last date to submit applications ended on May 21 and the   ministry decided not to give any more extension. To overcome the indifferent response, the department had given extension thrice, first on May 8, then May 13 and then finally till May 21. 

 On the whole, the government has received only 1,42, 219 applications of which 1,10,847 are from rural areas and 31,372 from urban areas including Hyderabad city. In Hyderabad city, 21,640 people submitted their applications online. "Even after giving three extensions, the total number of applications did not reach the half way mark. We have anticipated over 4 lakh applications going by 2011 census. We have actually prepared to spend over 4,000 crore on this scheme, but now the total expenditure would be less than 1,500 crore per annum," said a senior government official.
