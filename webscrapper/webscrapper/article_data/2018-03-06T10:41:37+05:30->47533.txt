After two weeks of build-up, WWE’s latest high-profile signing,   has a match at   at New Orleans and the UFC star will be teaming up with RAW General Manager,   at the Grandest Show of ‘em all to take on the WWE’s power couple - Stephanie McMahon and Triple H.

 Angle, who was sucker punched by Triple H the previous week, called out Triple H, only to be greeted by Stephanie. She in turn was interrupted by Rousey, who challenged Stephanie for a match at Wrestlemania 34. Angle pointed out that Stephanie was still under contract as a superstar in addition to her Commissioner status and granted the match. 
 
 Triple H intervened trying to get Angle backtrack his decision, but in turn he was inserted in to the Wrestlemania card with Angle announcing a Mixed Tag Team match between Rousey, Stephanie, Triple H and himself. 
 
 A furious Stephanie tried to slap Angle, only to be stopped by Rousey before Triple H tried to sneak attack Angle. Angle was prepared this time around and put Triple H in the Ankle Lock, but Triple H broke free shoving Angle to the ring corner. Stephanie attacked Rousey from behind and ran away. Triple H setup Angle for a pedigree, but Angle countered and locked the Ankle Lock. Stephanie came to the ring apron to rescue her husband, but was caught by Rousey who made a statement by hitting a Samoan Drop on Stephanie.
