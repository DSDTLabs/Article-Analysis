Kolkata: With Samajwadi Party sending feelers that it is considering   Bachchan as its Rajya Sabha nominee, Trinamool Congress indicated on Monday that it would take some time to firm up its nominations.

 Trinamool has the numbers in Bengal assembly to elect four RS members on its own, and has indicated that Jaya — a three-time Rajya Sabha MP — may be one among them. SP, however, isn’t keen on Jaya severing her decade-and-a-half long association with the party, sources indicated.
 
 According to Trinamool leaders privy to the development, the numbers are not stacking up for SP in Uttar Pradesh. Given BJP’s massive mandate (325 MLAs), it is sure of winning eight of the 10 seats up for election. Sources said that in the UP assembly, roughly 38 first preference votes are required to seal a candidate’s win. SP on its own can elect only one. The final candidate requires the opposition parties to coalesce together to elect a non-BJP candidate. 
 
 According to sources, the SP leadership has conveyed to Trinamool that it is trying to accommodate Jaya in the poll arithmetic. In this backdrop, it has urged Trinamool leadership not to hasten candidate declaration. 
 
 The Trinamool camp has indicated that chief minister Mamata Banerjee is likely to declare her candidates after the Holi weekend. According to the EC notification, the last day to file nominations for the March 23 polls is March 12. Trinamool Congress leaders indicated that this gave them enough time to declare candidates.
