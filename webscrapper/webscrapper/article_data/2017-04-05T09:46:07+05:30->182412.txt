HYDERABAD: The   verdict allowing students above 25 years to take   (NEET) 2017 has brought cheer to scores of students who had opposed the CBSE/ MCI move on age cap. 

 "I really wanted to make a final attempt to clear MBBS this year but the CBSE/MCI regulation on age cap had dashed my hopes. The SC judgment has now come as a big relief," said S Vasisth. 
 
 The sentiments were echoed by others too. "After finishing my  , circumstances forced me to study BSc. Today I have a decent job, but my dream is to pursue MBBS. I am very happy with the SC decision," K Yoshitha said, adding that lakhs of medical aspirants would be benefitted. 
 
 Professors, however, were of the view that this would not make much of a difference. "In  , the number of people taking MBBS entrance after 25 are very few," said Dr B Karunakar Reddy, vice-chancellor of   (KNRUHS). 
 
 "If anyone begins MBBS at the age of 25, by the time they finish their PG they will be around 35. So, I feel there will be very few who will opt for it," he added. NEET, which is a single test for admission to MBBS/BDS, will be conducted on May 7. Apart from extending age limit, the court also extended the last date to submit applications to April 5.
