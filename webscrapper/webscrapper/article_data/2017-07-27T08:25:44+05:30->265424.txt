LUCKNOW: From seven days, the 150-year-old ‘Gudiya mela’ celebration in Husainganj this year will be confined to just one day because of Metro construction in the area. The traditional fair used to be a grand event till last year, spanning from   to station road, but because of the barricading by Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation, it will remain confined to the crossroads at Husainganj. 

 Organised on the day of Nag Panchami, it is the only fair in the city for celebration of ‘Gudiya’ festival and people from across the city participate in the customary one-hour-session of beating the handmade dolls in afternoon on the festival day. 
 
 A resident of the area Aditya Srivastava, recalled, “When we were kids, my great grandfather used to take us all to this fair. I must have been around 3-year-old. He used to tell us tales about how a nawab of Awadh introduced the mela when he was a kid. I remember, at that time we used to pay 2 paisa for one round of the swing.”
 
 Along with offering an elaborate range of items on sale, the major attraction of the fair used to be various kinds of swings.
 
 “It is probably the only fair in the city to have so many swings, including giant wheel and Columbus but this year, I think we are not going to have any due to scarcity of space,” lamented Suresh Asthana, a shopkeeper and resident of the area.
 
 Former corporator of the area   said, “This year, it’s going to be only around the   and we have approval to allow only a few small swings for children below 10 years and even the number of vendors putting up stalls has fallen substantially.”
