KOLKATA: Union minister of state for civil aviation minister   has asked Kolkata airport authorities to furnish a detailed report on the alleged police presence in the air traffic control (ATC) tower on Friday when CM Mamata Banerjee’s flight was due from Bagdogra. This is the second instance of policemen entering the ATC to monitor its activity during the CM’s flight.

 
  
 
 On February 23, too, policemen were present in the ATC to oversee operations and “ensure that the flight carrying the VIP was not delayed”. Following this, AAI had asked   (CISF) to check ‘unnecessary’ entry of policemen into the ATC.
 
 “I will get a detailed report from the airport director. It will be sent to AAI chairman. We will assess it and, if required, take appropriate action,” Sinha said.
 
 ATC Guild, the umbrella organisation representing controllers, is peeved with the incursion of police into area control and tower, places that are zealously guarded to ensure that controllers can perform their duty without any disturbance or pressure. “External pressure can trigger a mistake with catastrophic consequence,” a senior controller said.
 
 Both the airport director and regional executive director (east) refused to speak given the sensitivity of the issue. AAI chairman  , however, acknowledged presence of outsiders in the ATC and said he had spoken to authorities in Kolkata on the matter.
