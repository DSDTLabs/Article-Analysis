LUCKNOW: If you are an   but unable to pay   because records still have the previous owner’s name, there is a way out.

 With a one-time charge of Rs 5,000,   has decided to allow   to update their names in municipal records. The proposal will be placed in the budget meeting of LMC’s executive committee on Monday.
 
 The move comes after LMC found that several flats, despite registration by the current owner, were still in the name of the previous owner or builder in its records.
 
 In such cases, during tax assessment, LMC officials ask for 1% of the property’s value or total DM circle rate to process mutation (change of ownership), so that after name change, the flat owner can pay tax conveniently.
 
 However, mutation cost is a huge financial burden on the flat owner. The situation would hit a road block as the resident would face a fine due to non-payment of tax but no actual payment would be made. With the new rule, flat owners can get their name updated in records and start paying taxes.
 
 Additional municipal commissioner PK Srivastava said, “This is not mutation, but just a formality to change the name in records to begin payment of taxes. This will prevent compound interest and fine on such people every year.” A decision on arrears in such cases will be taken later.
 
 
 
 For the first time, LMC will float municipal bonds to attract public investment to build an ambitious housing project near SGPGI.
 
 The cost of the apartments will range from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 70 lakh. The proposal will be placed in LMC’s budget meeting.
 
 Sprawling across 57,000 square feet, the project will provide self-financed flats to high, middle and lower income groups. It needs around Rs 100 crore for construction. LMC will also attract institutional investors to the bond.
