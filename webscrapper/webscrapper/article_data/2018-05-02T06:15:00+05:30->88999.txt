GHAZIABAD: A UP roadways bus allegedly knocked down a portion of a   on Tuesday that had been installed by the   barely 24 hours earlier to prevent heavy vehicles from taking a wrong U-turn.

 The 2.5-metre-high barrier had been installed on Monday at the U-turn in front of the UP Roadways bus depot in Kaushambi, following complaints by the   Apartments RWAs (KARWA) that heavy vehicles often entered the wrong side of the Link Road near the Delhi-UP border and caused jams .
 
  
 “On Tuesday morning, a bus entered the wrong side from Anand Vihar. It sped right up to the barrier and deliberately crashed against it. The bus belonged to UP roadways,” KARWA president Vinay Mittal said.
 
 The GDA was yet to lodge any police complaint when this report was being filed. “We have not filed a police complaint yet, but have spoken to the state road transport department. This is the second instance of a height barrier being dismantled deliberately. The buses also get damaged in the process, but the drivers have nothing to lose because the repair costs are met by the state government,” said Hira Lal Singh, a GDA executive engineer. “We have asked our engineering department to put up a sturdy barrier and construct a speed breaker.”
 
 Officials in the   said they had not received any complaint. “Private buses also use the U-turn to cross over to the wrong side. It was our department that had mooted the suggestion to install the height barrier. We will take action if we receive a complaint against any of our buses,” roadways regional manager PK Bose said.
