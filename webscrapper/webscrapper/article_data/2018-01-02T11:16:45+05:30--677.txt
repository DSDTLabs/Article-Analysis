INDORE: Amid celebrations of New Year across the city, as many as 250 residents of Machhi Bazaar-Kadavghat area on Monday woke with a fear of losing roof over their head since their homes are posing hurdles in construction of an 80-feet wide road under   project.

 Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) has marked 123 structures including some commercial establishments in one side, while 86 structures in other side of 600-metre stretch for complete or partial  . Besides, it has also marked 65 structures erected illegally upon   river catchment area. They will also be removed.
 
 Demolition-affected families on Monday were seen vacating and breaking their homes since they were expecting that the removal drive will begin from Tuesday. 
 
  “IMC commissioner Manish Singh had said that people living near to Kanh river will not be affected but they are now removing us,” said a group of residents told to IMC officials during the camp.
 
 Refuting the allegations, IMC deputy commissioner   said, “No such commitment or assurance was ever made by any of IMC officials. Apart from the encroachments posing hurdle in road widening work, we are also removing structures erected illegally in Kanh river catchment area.
 
 “We have marked 151 structures, which will reduce to less than 10 to 15 square feet area after the demolition. The occupants will be provided flats in different schemes of IMC,” IMC building officer   told TOI.
 
 He said that during two-day camp to address claims and objections, around 30 affected families have thus far approached them with their consent to shift. Following a good response of the resident at the camp, the civic body is likely to extend it for next few days.
 
 According to the official sources, the civic body will launch the demolition drive after chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s two-day visit to Indore on January 3 and 4.
