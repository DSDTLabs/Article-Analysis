HYDERABAD: Rise in instances of stalking in and around the city is becoming a matter of growing concern. “Stalking is being viewed seriously and several people have been sent to jail,” ACP (Crimes), Hyderabad, Swati Lakra told TOI.

 In a new method adopted by She Teams, it is not necessary for the victim to provide evidence. She Team members keep a watch in vulnerable areas and when a suspect is identified, a video recording is done. Actions including audio of the accused or indulging in eve-teasing are recorded and submitted to the court. “So far, accused have been convicted in 100% cases based on the evidence provided by the police,” Lakra said. The punishment is two to four days jail/fine or both.
 
 Stalkers are booked under Section 70(C) of Hyderabad Police Act, pertaining to nuisance. More serious cases are booked under Nirbhaya Act or IT Act, if it is cyber stalking. Instances of minors being stalked have also been booked under relevant sections. After cases are booked, She Teams hand over cases to respective area police stations for investigation. “Cases are also booked under Nirbhaya Act as noncognisable crimes,” she said.
 
 
  
 
 IPS officer Rema Rajeshwari said that all stalking cases should be made non-cognisable under Nirbhaya Act as it may act as a deterrence.
 
 Lakra said stern measures are being taken against those indulging in stalking. Repeat offenders in two cases were booked under Preventive Detention Act. The families of accused are also informed about the crime and the accused have to give regular attendance at the police station. “We plan to send an SMS to those who have been previously caught in the act as a reminder that they are under police radar,” Lakra said.
