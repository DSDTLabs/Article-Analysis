I reached the hospital at around 7 am on April 29. The police told me that they couldn’t let Sonika’s family members know about the mishap and asked me if I could help. Perhaps, they didn’t want to open the bag because it was a woman’s. When I got hold of one of her phones, it was drenched in blood. Both her phones were password protected so I couldn’t open any and, hence, gave them back to the police. Her family members were later informed by 
the police themselves.
 
 I knew   was in a relationship with Sonika. She would often come to meet him at our shoot location. They’d go to a nearby cafe and spend time with each other. There wasn’t a hint of doubt that they were dating. I did, however, once ask Vikram if he was indeed dating her and if so, what happened to her long-term relationship with Shaheb (Bhattacherjee). Vikram told me, Shaheb and   had broken up long back but the tension between them was still palpable. Shaheb wanted Sonika back in his life but Sonika had perhaps fallen out of love with him.
 
 Honestly, I have never seen Vikram driving rash. He always insists that his co-passenger wears the seatbelt. I am sure the law will take its own course but till then, can we stop the social media trial? If Vikram was at fault that night, he will be punished. Why pass judgement and punish him before he’s even convicted in the court of law? Give a person who has lost a great deal in a fatal accident physically, mentally and emotionally, the time to come out of the trauma. Yes, Vikram resumed shoot of his megaserial; he’s in a legal contract with the channel. One of the co-actors broke into tears while hugging him. And to those who are saying he’s perfectly all right to be shooting, I just have one thing to say — he is a zombie now. He doesn’t speak a word despite our best efforts. He is devastated, and so are we, at Sonika’s untimely demise.
