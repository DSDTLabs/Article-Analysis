Bani puts a skateboard on the Prince's way and he falls. Thapki takes Bani away and scolds her for doing it. Bani tells Thapki that she is thirsty and hungry and the prince was eating infront of her and teasing.
 
  Thapki feels bad for Bani and gives her an idea. Bani then pretends to faint and everyone comes running towards her. Thapki then asks the prince to get water for her. As soon as he does, Amma maayi stops him. Bihaan gets furious and brings water.
  
  They are about to make Bani drink when Amma maayi snatches away the glass. In a while the prince faints. Amma maayi rushes to him and makes him drink water.
  
  Bihaan's mother insults her and tells how she has been differentiating between boys and girls.
  
  Bihaan and Thapki manage to rescue Tina. Thapki sees Monty and tries to convince him to make sense and make Amma maayi understand that child marriage is a crime.
  
  He doesn't listen. Bihaan then threatens Amma maayi that they are not scared anymore and won't let their daughters be there. Amma maayi then makes them listen to a recording by Thapki giving consent to her to get Bani married. It is actually Shraddha's voice.
