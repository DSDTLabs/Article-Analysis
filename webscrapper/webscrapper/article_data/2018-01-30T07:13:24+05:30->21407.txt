PALAMPUR: Infighting in   BJP, which had kicked off over the candidature of party’s state mahila morcha chief Indu   from the hometown of senior party leader and MP   during 2017 assembly elections, took an interesting turn on Sunday when two factions allegedly tried to host dinner for the CM. 

 On the first day of winter sojourn of chief minister   on Sunday, two factions –– one led by district party president   (a supporter of Shanta Kumar) and other led by Indu Goswami –– organized different dinner parties.
 
 While Goswami with other party supporters had planned a dinner at Rajput Bhawan Palampur, Vinay Sharma-led faction had made arrangements for the dinner at his hotel.
 
 Though Goswami with her supporters welcomed the CM near the old bus stand, other faction managed to take the CM to the hotel, sources said.
 
 “Goswami had made arrangements with hundreds of party workers. But some party leaders took the CM to the hotel,” sources added.
 
 Goswami didn't attend the dinner at the hotel. When contacted, she said, “My daughter was not keeping well, so I couldn’t attend the event.”
 
 Well-placed sources in BJP said Goswami lodged a protest with CM Jai Ram Thakur in the morning hours following which the CM addressed a press conference making Goswami to sit along with him.
 
 Vinay Sharma refused to comment on this issue.
