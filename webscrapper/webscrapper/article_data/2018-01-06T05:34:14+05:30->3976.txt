KOLKATA: The coaches for the East-West Metro corridor in Kolkata may not be ready for some time yet but a mock-up of one has arrived in the city from BEML Ltd in Bengaluru.   Rail Corporation Ltd (KMRCL) and Metro Railway officials will inspect the mock-up and send back recommendations or suggestions, if any, to BEML and necessary alterations in the design will be incorporated. KMRCL will be unveiling the mock-up coach soon.

  “The rakes will run on 750V DC and collect current from the third rail. The six-coach rakes will comprise two driving motor cars (DMCs) at either end, two motor cars (MCs) and two trailing cars (TCs). The carrying capacity of every rake will be 2,068 passengers. The DMCs will be 21,050mm long while the length of the other coaches will be 20,800 mm each. The maximum width and height of the coaches will be 2,880mm and 3,848mm. The coaches have stainless steel shells with dull finish exteriors. The mock-up is an exact replica of a coach, save for the fact that it can’t move,” a senior KMRCL official said.
 
 The coaches will have aesthetically appealing glass-fibre reinforced plastic panels, longitudinal stainless steel seats, state-of-the-art LED lights and wide vestibules for easier movement of passengers. 
 
 “The maximum design speed of the rakes will be 90 km/hr with a maximum operational speed of 80km/hr. The coaches will have primary rubber springs and secondary air suspensions with wheel-mounted disk brakes. There will be roof-mounted saloon air conditioners and cab air conditioners. The coaches will also have passenger announcement (PA), passenger information system (PIS) and CCTV cameras for surveillance. We plan to unveil the mock-up coach soon,” a KMRCL official said.
