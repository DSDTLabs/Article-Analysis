BENGALURU: A presidential intervention kept CBSE and ICSE schools out of the state government’s ambit when the Karnataka Education Act was enacted in 1983. However, over three decades later, the state cabinet decided to bring private schools under its control over fee fixation and safety regulations.

 A day after the cabinet decision, schools said control should be over those institutions which hike their fees by 25% every year. The schools also said the annual 8%-10% hike in fees must be allowed. 
 
 Noting that fee fixation is a much larger issue that needs better understanding,  , member, board of management of CBSE schools association in the state, said, “All schools cannot be treated under the same formula. CBSE schools have requirements that are way different from the state board schools or ICSE schools.”
 
 He added, “As an association, we’re trying our best to create a self-monitoring arm to be conscious about fee hikes. But an 8%-10% hike annually is normal when teachers’ salaries, upgradation of infrastructure and inflation are taken into consideration.”
 
 The government had tried to take control of CBSE and ICSE schools. After a presidential exemption was given in 1983, a major amendment was proposed in 2014 which would take away their autonomy. The amendment proposed to look into the overall functioning of these schools with autonomy of boards restricted only to admission, syllabus and examinations. While the amendment was never made official, the controversial subject has been taken up again by the Siddaramaiah government.
 
 However, the ambiguity of the amendment this time has led experts to keep calm until anything is official. Khan said, “If the government wants to monitor fees, we’re fine with it. But if it’s going to implement a regulatory body, we expect no harassment and the implementation must be realistic. We need clarity on whether the government will only monitor or regulate the fee hike.”
 
 Fee regulation in other states
 
 * In Maharashtra, the   in December 2015 contended that the state was yet to set up various committees look into the proposals of schools regarding fees charged. An amendment to the   (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2011 was made to enforce that if schools wanted to hike their fees over 15%, they would have to take the consent of an executive committee consisting of the parent-teacher association. While the fee regulation act is applicable to all schools, the fees can be raised only once in two years.
 
 * The Delhi government has a say in safety and fees fixed in CBSE and ICSE schools. However, the directorate of education does not get to intervene in the overall operation. Schools are expected to follow guidelines regarding fees and safety issued by the directorate.
 
 * Tamil Nadu had set up a committee headed by a retired high court judge who would fix and regulate fee hikes after listening to the schools’ justification for it. In January this year, the Supreme Court curtailed the powers of the committee in determining and regulating fee structures in CBSE and ICSE schools. The committee can only verify fees collected by schools and if its facilities are upgraded enough, hearing complaints with regard to excess fee collection and recommending of disaffiliation of the school to the CBSE board in case it charges extra fees.
 
 * Telangana is yet to have a system in place to monitor and regulate fees charged by private schools. In September last year, the Supreme Court directed that the state can and should constitute a district fee regulatory committee to regulate fees in private schools. On Friday, the director of school education department in Telangana submitted proposals for fee regulation in private and unaided schools and had proposed to constitute DFRCs to recommend fee structure for each school.
