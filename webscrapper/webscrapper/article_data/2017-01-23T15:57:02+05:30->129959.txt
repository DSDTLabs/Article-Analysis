WASHINGTON: Gaffe-prone   has misspelled the word 'honour' in one of his first tweets as US President, evoking both amused and critical responses from netizens.

 "I am 
  to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the  !", Trump, an avid Twitter user, tweeted shortly after assuming office.
 
 Instead of using the US spelling of 'honored' or even the British spelling 'honoured', Trump decided to spell it in a completely different (and incorrect) way.
 The tweet was quickly deleted and re-posted with the correct spelling, but not before several people had replied querying the President's spelling.
 "Good grief. Four more years of this," wrote one on Twitter.
 
 Another accused the 70-year-old Republican of being "the most illiterate president ever".
 
 "It's kind of fitting that he doesn't know how to spell "honour" lol." (SIC)
 
 In December, Trump had tweeted that China had ripped a US Navy research drone out of international waters in an 'unpresidented' act. It was soon corrected to 'unprecedented.'
 
 In February, he also boasted about his performance at  's Republican debate in Houston, tweeting, "Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great 
 !"
