Nagpur: The fate of jogging and cycling tracks of Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) on land belonging to Dr Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV) is in limbo as the university authorities are reluctant to part with their land. NMC wants the land near VIP Road in Dharampeth. It is a grade I heritage precinct and PKV itself had landed in trouble when NMC issued a show cause notice to it for constructing a building on the land. PKV registrar Prakash Kadu told TOI that the university did not want to reduce the land available to its students for research. “The issue of providing land to NMC for the tracks has been coming up before our executive council since last one year but no decision has been taken so far. Finally even though we are using the land it belongs to the state government,” he said.  Kadu clarified that the university had not shot down NMC’s proposal and it was still under consideration. Earlier, Dr ND Parlawar, associate dean (Nagpur), had said that it would not be easy for NMC to get the land. PKV had provided land opposite Institute of Engineers to MahaMetro for developing a parking lot. Commenting on this, Kadu said, “The area of the land required by Metro was very less - 80 square metre. So we decided to hand it over.” Even though PKV is yet to give its no objection certificate (NOC) for allowing NMC to use the land, state urban development ministry has sanctioned Rs5.47 crore for constructing the tracks. The total cost of the project is Rs9.47 crore. State government is likely to put pressure on PKV authorities to part with the land. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis had saved the university’s Shetkari Bhavan when NMC wanted to raze it. Fadnavis had changed the reservation of the land on which the building was constructed.
