 The Goa Medical College (GMC) and hospital, Bambolim, will shortly float a tender to operate hospital canteens to provide quality and nutritious food. The tender conditions have been finalized, and it’s likely to be out shortly. For the first time, the government-run hospital will have dietician attached to the canteen so that of patients – diabetes, heart patients and others - are given food as per their requirement.
 
 One of the canteens will offer Goan food – fish, curry, rice – for visitors and staff, said a senior GMC official. “There will be special diet meals for patients,” said the officer.
 
 The responsibility of upgrading the hospitals will be upon the contractor. The GMC canteens are not in good shape, as also the meals are nothing great.
 
 A few months ago, Foods and Drugs Administration (FDA) had sealed all three canteens at premier hospital due to poor hygiene. The canteens were unsealed only there was a compliance of defects pointed out by FDA.
 
 A GMC staffer said even though canteens have been mended and things improved a little in terms of hygiene, they haven’t seen any change in the menu.
 
 “It is only when we run of time that we eat hospital canteen. We carry food from home most of the time,” said a group of GMC students.
 
 Another GMC staffer said he is not very happy with the meals and snacks served at any of the GMC’s canteens. “I prefer to go outside GMC campus to eat fish, curry and rice, rather than eat drab meal at hospital canteen,” he said.
 
 Most staff, he said take their meals from small stall outside GMC. But it is not always possible to make time to go out, and hence many are compelled to eat whatever available within GMC premises during hunger.
 
 “It is a high time, that government have contractors changed in the GMC, so that staff, patients and visitors have access to quality food,” he adds .
