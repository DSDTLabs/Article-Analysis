HOWRAH: A case of causing grievous hurt, threatening and cruelty has been lodged against a   for allegedly striking a Class-VI student with a hot cooking ladle at her house in Howrah’s Tinkori Bose Lane. The accused, Pinky Mondal, “punished” the 12-year-old girl on Monday for allegedly making mistakes in her assignment. The girl sustained severe burns on both hands. 

 The victim, who lives a few houses away from Mondal’s, refused to accompany her mother and grandmother to their relative’s house for lunch as she was eager to attend her English tuitions.
 
 The girl’s mother alleged the tutor had heated up the ladle before striking her daughter. “My daughter was told that a mere beating was not enough for the errors she had made in her homework. After striking her right hand, Mondal went back to the kitchen to heat up the ladle again and struck her on left hand. She then made my daughter stand barefoot on the concrete outside her house. It was around 11am and the floor was heated, so my daughter collapsed,” the mother said.
 
 Locals later took her to a hospital. ACP (north) of Howrah City Police, Vabna Gupta, said, “The tutor inflicted tremendous cruelty on the girl. We are looking for Mondal who fled after locking her house.”
