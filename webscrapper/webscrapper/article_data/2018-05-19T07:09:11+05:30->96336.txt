AHMEDABAD: A bank   informed city police control room after a suspect in an ATM   case visited the same bank branch once again. He was identified on the basis of a baseball   with army   prints, which he had worn on a few earlier incidents of fraud as well. Ranip police said that they suspect the accused to be involved in multiple cases of fraud with similar modus operandi.

 According to Ranip police, Ila Parmar, a resident of Akshay Jyot Apartment, Ranip, had been to SBI Bank branch near Subhash Bridge on August 3. When she visited the   kiosk at 5.35pm, a man wearing a baseball cap had told her that she should check another ATM as the one she was using was not functional. In the process, the man allegedly swapped her debit card. As he had seen Parmar using the card, he had memorized the PIN. Using the details, the man had withdrawn Rs 40,000.
 
 “When Parmar approached the bank manager, he checked the   footage and assured her that if the man visits the bank again, he would inform her. On Thursday, she got a call from the manager to visit the bank and identify the person. The person - identified as Nagji Rabari, 46, along with his accomplice Pravin Salat, 19, both residents of Kalpataru Society, Adalaj, were identified by her after which city police control room was informed,” said an investigator.
 
 J G Patel, inspector of Ranip police station, said that both have been found to be involved in multiple incidents of fraud with similar modus operandi. “Search at their residences will be carried out to get documentary evidences in the case. We appeal to citizens to not use the ATM kiosk when someone is inside and never allow any person to handle their debit card to prevent such frauds,” he said.
