NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has asked for the implementation of the counter-terrorism contingency plan (CTCP) at the earliest at sensitive airports across the country in view of intelligence agencies warning of possible attempts to carry out terror strikes or hijackings by the   jihadi group, al-Qaida or Pakistan-based militant outfits like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad. 

 Under the CTCP, CISF personnel guard the approach roads of airports to screen visitors before they arrive at the departure or arrival terminals. As of now, CTCP is in place only at Delhi and Mumbai airports. 
 
 Sources said the CISF has prepared a CTCP for each hyper-sensitive airport and is awaiting the government’s nod. According to the latest intelligence inputs, international terrorist groups and even Khalistani terrorists are making plans to target Indian airports. 
 
 While asking for strengthening of security at airports, the agencies have cited the attacks at airports in Europe in the recent past. 
 
 A parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture had pointed out last year after the attack on   airbase that 20 hyper-sensitive and international airports lacked contingency plans and called the situation “quite scary”. 
 
 There are 98 operational airports in India, out of which 26 are categorised ‘hyper-sensitive’. Only 18 of these hypersensitive airports are covered by CISF while others are managed by police forces. Of the 56 airports categorised as ‘sensitive’, CISF manages only 37. Officials added that CISF’s proposal is being seriously considered by the ministries of home and civil aviation. 
 
 The government has approved handing over the security of Jabalpur and Jamnagar airports to CISF.
