CHHAPRA: With the state government recently converting   into a corporation, the process of delimitation of wards has begun. However, many people are disappointed as several important localities have been left out of the town  .

 The State Election Commission has asked the officials concerned to reconstitute the existing wards as per the norms of the urban development department by February 25. Objections, if any, would be rectified by March 10 and after the approval of the commissioner, the final list would be displayed on March 23. The wards are to be reconstituted on population, varying from 3,497 to 4,497. Panchayati raj department officer Santosh Kumar said the existing 44 wards would be reconstituted in 45.
 
 Although, Chhapra has more than 2 lakh population as per 2011 census, the town was deprived of a corporation status. The local administration had tried to include some of the surrounding localities, such as   and Sarha, in the town. However, these localities have been left out of the town due to technical difficulties.
 
 Residents of the town are hopeful of improvement in civic amenities. Dr Rajib Kumar Singh, a medical practitioner, said, “Tap water and drainage facilities should be introduced in all the wards and garbage lifted by the corporation.”
