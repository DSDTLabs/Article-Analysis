Mumbai: The civic-run Babasaheb Ambedkar Municipal General   in  , which had grabbed headlines after two female patients were attacked by rats in the ward merely three months ago, has beaten some of the leading five-star hospitals to become the “second cleanest” hospital in an internal competition. 

 It scored better than Bandra’s Asian Heart Institute, which had to settle for third position in the Swachha hospitals category.
 
 The Tata Memorial Hospital, Parel, won the top prize for cleanliness in the competition that was held by the BMC’s Solid Waste Management department. Fifty-eight hospitals were assessed in the category. 
 
 The non-profit United Way Mumbai was appointed the third-party agency to carry out the evaluation based on parameters that included overall cleanliness, waste disposal management and feedback from patient and relatives about the neatness in and around the hospital premises. 
 
 “It was a sort of internal evaluation for the hospitals. The nominations included a minimum of three hospitals from each of the 24 wards,” said Ajay Govale from United Way, who coordinated the project. He said that feedback from patients and their relatives was also collected. 
 
 “We looked at waste segregation, disposal of biomedical waste, mechanism of waste disposal, the number of times premises are cleaned, et cetera,” he said. Besides hospitals, markets, housing societies and schools were also judged. 
 
 Ambedkar Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr Pradip Angre said that it was a proud moment for the centre that was marred in controversy over issues of hygiene. “We have an influx of nearly 15000 patients daily, which makes cleanliness a unique challenge for us,” he said.
