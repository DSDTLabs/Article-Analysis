Panchkula: A shopkeeper was injured when his neighbour, along with three others, thrashed him following an argument over unloading of goods in Raipur Rani on Tuesday.

 Rohit Kumar, a resident of Raipur Rani, in his complaint said he runs a confectionery store in the village. “On Tuesday morning, I had a war of words with my neighbour Balwinder alias Vicky when I was unloading goods from a mini pick-up van in front of my shop. Vicky told not to unload goods parking the vehicle on the road in front of the shop. We indulged into a quarrel after which Vicky left,” he said.
 
 “However, he returned at 9.30 pm the same day with three others whose faces were covered. At the time of closing down, they entered my shop and started beating me up with blunt weapons.”
 
 Local people interfered and helped Kumar out of the situation. However, by then Kumar had lost his consciousness when one out of four accused hit his head with an iron rod.
 
 He was rushed to a hospital nearby and was discharged after treatment. Kumar filed a complaint with the cops.
 
 On the basis of his complaint, cops registered a case under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 34 (act done by several person with same intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in Raipur Rani police station. Investigating officer Rajbir said, “The investigation in the case is under progress.”
