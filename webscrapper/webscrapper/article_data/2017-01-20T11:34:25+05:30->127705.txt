KOLHAPUR: The   (KMC) has decided to   imposed on  .

 The waiver scheme will be applicable for two months — from February 1 up to March 31, 2017 — for all types of properties. As per an estimate, about 40,000 property owners can avail benefit of the scheme to settle their pending tax dues.
 
 “The city has over 1.40 lakh registered property owners. However, not everyone is paying taxes on time. Habitual defaulters have ignored payment of taxes despite repeated reminders. Now, they have a chance to settle the dues,” said a KMC official.
 
 The property tax arrears are around Rs 80 crore and the civic body expects good recovery during the two-month long scheme. The authorities clarified that this would be the last chance for defaulters as similar scheme would not come at least for the next five years. The waiver will be applicable for pending dues and not for the current dues.
 
 The KMC has set a target of Rs 55 crore from property tax collection in 2016-17. The tax collection was up in  . The civic body had collected Rs 38 crore as property tax till mid-November.
 
 The proposal to announce a waiver on penalty was passed by civic body’s general body last year which was then sent to the state government for further approval. The government’s urban development department clarified the civic body that it can go ahead with a waiver decision at the local level.
 
 Mayor   has appealed to the defaulters to settle their dues and avail discount on penalty. “The step will help civic body’s revenue collection,” she said.
 
 Meanwhile, the civic body has said that as of now waiver will be applicable only for property tax penalty dues. The standing committee and general body had demanded a similar waiver for water tax. However, sources said the civic body will have to refer the proposal to the state government for approval. The decision cannot be taken on local level, sources said.
