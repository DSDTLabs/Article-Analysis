RANCHI: Chief minister   on Thursday criticised public sector and and private banks for being "reluctant to release" funds meant for social development schemes in the state. In a meeting with state-level chiefs of banks at his office in   on Thursday evening, Das expressed his displeasure at the delay in release of funds to beneficiaries under schemes like   (PMAY). 

 A statement issued by the   quoted Das saying that most complaints are being received in disbursement of funds under the PMAY. "Several cases are being reported where beneficiaries are not getting any money after the first installment. This is slowing down PMAY works and the government will not tolerate such laxity. No one should have to run around for getting their dues," Das was quoted as saying. 
 
 Das told the bank officials that dedicated officers must be deputed for seeding bank accounts with Aadhaar cards. He also directed them to open ATM machines at block and panchayat offices so that account holders in rural areas do not have to queue outside bank branches to withdraw money. 
 
 The CM also suggested that the banks be lenient towards Sakhi Mandals. "They usually have small loans, which are repaid on time. They can become self sufficient only with the help of banks," Das was quoted as saying. "Provide the list of willful defaulters to the district administration so that they can help in the recovery of funds," he added.
