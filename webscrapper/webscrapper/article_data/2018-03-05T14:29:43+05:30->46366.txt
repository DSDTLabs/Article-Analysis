NEW DELHI: Two days after being robbed by a man who offered her biscuits laced with sedatives, a 60-year-old woman went back to the same spot where she met him and got him arrested. 

 The accused, Philip alias Vicky (24), was offering biscuits to another woman at the   bus stand in   on Saturday evening when he was caught. 
 
 The woman, Vijay Sahdev, was robbed by Vicky on February 28 when she was going to Hari Nagar. Around 11.30am, Vicky had approached her at the Uttam Nagar bus stand. He told her that he too was going to Hari Nagar and that it was his birthday. He also said that he had lost both his parents recently and she reminded him of his mother, adding that he will feel better if she had a biscuit. 
 
  Sahdev reluctantly took one biscuit as they both got into a bus. She later felt unconscious in the bus, only to get up an hour later. Sahdev found that her earrings and wallet were missing and she was only left with her phone. 
 
 On Saturday evening, Sahdev was going to   with her son in his car when she asked him to stop at the bus stop where she had met Vicky, hoping she will find him. To her luck, as she stepped out of the car, she spotted Vicky holding a packet of biscuit in his hand and talking to another woman.
 
 Sahdev immediately raised an alarm, after which her son and passersby caught hold of Vicky. He was later handed over to the police. Senior police officers said that Sahdev will be rewarded for her brave act.
