Gandhinagar: The Gujarat government has classified several Indian Administrative Service (IAS) posts as non-IAS posts because of the non-availability of IAS officers for the posts. Currently, there are 297 sanctioned posts for the IAS for which around 200 officers are available and 65 posts are vacant. Some officers are on central deputation and study leave.

 Chief secretary J N Singh said that non-availability of IAS officers as well as non-requirement of IAS officers on many posts led to the move.
 
 According to a statement issued by the general administrative department, the state government has made posts equivalent to additional secretaries for managing director of Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Ltd, Mehsana; municipal commissioners of Gandhinagar and Bhavnagar; commissioner of municipalities, state project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan; director of primary education; and relief commissioner. 
 
 For posts equivalent to joint secretary level, CEO of D-Sag (Development Support Agency of Gujarat); municipal commissioner of Junagadh; deputy commissioner of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation; managing director of Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd etc., have been notified.
