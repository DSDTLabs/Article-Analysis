PUNE: Despite the year-end uptick in sales of two-wheelers over the last four days, the overall offtake of two wheelers in the 2016-17 fiscal year wasn't a huge improvement from the previous year's figures. 

 In the two-wheeler category, the number of registrations was up by a mere 312 units. Overall, 1,78,469 two-wheelers were registered in FY 2017. 
 
 Based on the number of registrations for the year, an average of 489 two-wheelers were sold daily in the area under the jurisdiction of the Pune   (RTO). On March 31 alone, 3,871 two-wheelers were sold - about 8 times the daily average.
 
 Dealerships had resorted to deep discounting to clear the Bharat Stage-III (BS-III) stock after the   ruled against sale and registration of such vehicles from April 1, 2017.
 
 But for this discount, two-wheeler sales would been short of last year's figures, by over 2%. This was reflective of trends from auto   since November 2016, which showed that sales were hammered by demonetisation. 
 
 Overall, in the Pune RTO region, 2,68,775 vehicles of all categories were registered in the April 2016 to March 2017 period, up by 7.73% over the same period the previous year. This growth was led by taxi cabs, trucks and lorries, and to an extent, passenger cars. 
 
 The figure does not include the registrations at the   as the body has yet to collate its yearly figures.
