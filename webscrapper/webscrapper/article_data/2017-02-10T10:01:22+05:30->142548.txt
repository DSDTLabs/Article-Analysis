ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad   on Thursday ruled that it is the   of every child of six to 14 years of age to get  , and it is the duty of the government and local bodies to provide schools to them in close vicinity.

 The court also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the petitioner, Abu Bakar, of Harha in  , who had moved a PIL seeking stay on the construction of a school on public utility land in his village.
 
 While dismissing the PIL, Justice S P Kesarwani expressed the view that it is the fundamental right of every child of 6 to 14 years of age to receive education and filing of a PIL asking court to restrain construction of a school does not benefit public at large. 
 
 Justice Kesarwani further observed that the petitioner had filed a PIL asking it to interfere in construction of a school for children, who are entitled to free and compulsory education as provided under Article 21A of the Constitution.
 
 The petitioner had contended that as there was a school in an adjacent village, there was no need to construct another school in the same village as children who are interested in studying can take admission in the school already running in the adjacent village.
