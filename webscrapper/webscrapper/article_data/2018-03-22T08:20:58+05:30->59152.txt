PUNE: Customs authorities on Wednesday morning nabbed a Mumbai-based man, who was returning from Dubai, for trying to smuggle gold worth Rs 17.57 lakh. The precious metal was coated with rhodium, a chemical element, and was neatly concealed in fancy hair bands, hair clips and  .

 Bharat Nawale, deputy commissioner (Pune airport), said the man,  , hails from Trombay and had gone to Dubai from Mumbai on March 17. On his return journey, Sheikh took a SpiceJet flight and had landed at the Pune airport around 4:25am.
 
 “It was a clever way of smuggling as the things were neatly packed in separate plastic pouches so that they appeared to be brand new. All the items were kept in a box in checked-in luggage,” a senior official said. “Sheikh tried to pass through the green channel. However, he was stopped at the arrival hall for suspicious movements, following which his entire luggage was checked. When the corrugated box he was carrying was opened, some metallic pieces were found concealed in hair clips, hair bands, key chains and other items. The metallic pieces were, then, checked carefully by a government valuer who found rhodium plated 24 karat gold weighing 566.78 gram,” the official said.
 
 “The entire modus operandi is unique considering the fact that Sheikh is a fresh recruit. He wanted to go to Dubai to meet one of his relatives but didn’t have a passport or money. The kingpin, who is yet to be identified, behind the racket got Sheikh’s passport done. The passport was issued on March 1. His visa was also managed by him,” Nawale said.
