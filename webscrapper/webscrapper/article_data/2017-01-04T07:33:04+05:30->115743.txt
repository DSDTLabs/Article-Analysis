BENGALURU: The city's notoriously fickle weather conditions are leaving many residents feverish and breathless.
According to doctors, they see an increasing number of patients with fever and respiratory ailments. Sunny days and nippy nights are to blame.
 
 Dr  , senior consultant, internal medicine,  , who sees 2030 patients with viral and bacterial infections daily, said an increasing number of citizens are suffering from fever and wheez ing because of weather fluctuations. “We are also witnessing a spike in the number of virus related muscle problems. Since viruses get activated in this kind of weather, one hypothesis is that they are partially responsible for the spike. Even the number of upper respiratory tract infection cases has increased,“ he explained.
 
 Dr  , senior consultant, internal medicine,  , agreed. “If I see 20 patients in a day, eight of them have upper respiratory tract problems.“
 
 Pneumonia and asthma are some other ailments patients are complaining of. Dr Ashok SN, consultant at St Martha's Hospital, gets 10-12 patients every day who suffer from fever, throat pain and cold.
 
 Asthma, pulmonary disease symptoms worsen
 
 Doctors say symptoms of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worsen in varying climatic conditions.“A study conducted in Bengaluru a few years ago concluded that asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing and breathlessness increased following a 14 degree celsius or higher fluctuation in temperature during the day. This is exactly what we are experiencing now, where the afternoon temperature is 20-30 degrees Celsius and the night temperature is 14-15 degrees Celsius,“ said Dr Murali Mohan, senior consultant pulmonologist, Narayana Health City.
