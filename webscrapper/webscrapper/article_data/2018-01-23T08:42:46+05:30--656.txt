MELBOURNE:   had little to offer in her maiden Grand Slam final at the US Open last year against compatriot and friend Sloane Stephens. The 22-year-old started well, but came apart spectacularly, nerves derailing her challenge. She even got bagelled in the second set.

 
 Keys, seeded 17 at the  , took a while to get over New York, the final for which she didn’t quite show up. “A week to 10 days after was really tough, my sleep schedule was totally messed up. I was tired from all the late, emotional matches. And then to have such a great two weeks and have it end the way it did was devastating,” Keys said.
 
 The American, amiable and articulate in her shotmaking, underwent wrist surgery last year, missing the Melbourne Park fortnight, where she made the semifinals in 2015, falling to  . Keys’ coaches, former No.1   and Dieter Kindlmann, Maria Sharapova’s ex-hitting partner, helped her through the rough phase.
 
 On Monday, striking the ball fiercely, she shocked the eighth-seeded Caroline Garcia to make the last eight. “I have finally moved on and wanted to put myself in the same position again, so that maybe I could have a different outcome,” she said.
 
 “They left me alone at first,” she said of her coaches after the US Open loss, “Then they were really vocal, saying they want me to talk to them if I’m having certain emotions or however I’m feeling. Even after the final, Kim (Clijsters) came up to me and said, ‘I have been in the exact same position. It sucks. I know.’ Lindsay said the exact same thing.”
 
 Keys plays former No.1 Angelique Kerber next.
