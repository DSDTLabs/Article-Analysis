NEW DELHI: After Pakistan PM   was forced to resign after the   Papers verdict,   questioned the lack of investigations against those Indians whose names had figured in leaked papers.

 Senior party member Ashutosh said it was ironical that India’s democracy was considered much more robust than Pakistan’s but despite that, the neighbouring country had forced its PM to resign.
 
 “Taking cognisance of the names mentioned in the papers, Pakistan’s   has disqualified its own PM.. However, it is highly surprising that Indian PM  , who has been talking about wiping out corruption from the country, has not even initiated an investigation against those named from India,” he said.
 
 The party said that 474 people from India had been named in the Panama Papers, which included high profile people like politicians, film starts, builders and industrialists but, the government had not even started an investigation.
 
 “It is beyond our understanding that why, despite allegations of a severe nature, no action has been taken against those named in the papers. Let alone action, the government has not even started an investigation against these people, many of whom are known to be extremely close to the PM and the ruling BJP. India’s judiciary is hailed as one of the best in the world but it has done nothing in this case,” Ashutosh added.
 
 He alleges that agencies like CBI, ED and IT department go only after opposition leaders.
