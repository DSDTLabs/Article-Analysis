ATTAPADI: She doesn't eat egg or sugar, but that didn't stop   from cutting a cake for the first time to celebrate her birthday. It was her 45th birthday and this was the first time the activist-turned-politician took a vacation. In search of peace and tranquillity, she chose a remote ashram `Santhi Gramam' in Attapadi.

 She felt that the   had used money and muscle power to gain power in Manipur. Admitting that in   there are several unresolved issues she said: “Due to poverty and insecurity, people are influenced by muscle and money power.“ Despite setbacks, she warned that she would always continue her fight against injustice.
 
 “I came here to see the people, know Kerala,“ she said, dressed in traditional Manipuri attire with a white top and yellow skirt. Though a bit bitter after her humiliating poll defeat, her childlike smile and liveliness was on display when she saw the birthday cake.
 
 “I have never celebrated my birthday. My birthday has always been just like another day in my life. It is such a symbolic day in my life today, coinciding with my first day in Kerala,“ she said.
 
 The activist, who entered politics after her 16-year-long hunger strike against the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in August 2016, contested assembly elections against   leader   in Thoubal constituency, where he had won the past three elections. Singh defeated her by a margin of 15,000 votes.
 
 “I won't say that all politicians are the same. Politics is dirty by nature and the system conditions them. My entry into politics has been cut off at the beginning by society. If I was in politics, then amid this current group, I would be different,“ she said.
