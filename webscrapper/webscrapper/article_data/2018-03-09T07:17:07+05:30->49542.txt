RANCHI: A day-long stakeholders'   organised jointly by the   (CEED),   (JREDA) and   on Thursday sought inputs on strengthening the draft   for Jharkhand. The draft policy, prepared by the CEED, would help in providing   to 55% of households in the state, which are yet to receive access to power supply, and achieve the government's dream of 'energy access to all'. 

 CEED programme officer Pooja Kumari said, "While electrification of villages in Jharkhand has been completely achieved, the figures of the Centre shows that till January 2018, 55% of households in the state were not electrified. The Mini Grid Policy will help in electrification of these households and will be a complimentary policy for the government's Saubhagya scheme which calls for 24x7 power supply to every household."
 
 Installation of power grids is not possible at many places in the state due to geographical barriers. Mini grids with 50kW to 100kW capacity would help these areas get access to electricity which will be generated using renewable energy sources like solar energy or biogas. 
 
 JREDA director Niranjan Kumar said, "With this policy we wish to address the issue of rural electrification through a decentralised approach and to help remove all barriers to investment with better regulation of the mini-grid sector, which, in turn, will benefit the people of the state."
 
 JSERC chairman Arvind Prasad said, "The policy is a positive step in the direction of regulating the mini grid sector and offering excellent opportunities for private investment in the realm of rural electrification through renewable energy."
