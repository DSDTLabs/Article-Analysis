VADODARA: Vadodara Municipal Corporation ( ) will be constructing six new urban health centres (UHC) in the city. The UHCs will come up as a part of the drive to modernize such health facilities for which the state government is also giving grants.

 According to VMC officials, the work on new building for 18 of the 34 existing UHCs has been completed last year. This year, the VMC will take up work on the remaining 15 UHCs in the second phase of the project.
 
 A proposal to construct new buildings for six of the 15 remaining UHCs in the city has been placed before the standing committee of the civic body. These have to be made as per the two designs provided by the civic body.
 
 The VMC could not identify an agency to take up the work initially and could do so only after the tender conditions were modified. The civic body has identified an agency that will construct the new buildings at a cost of Rs7.84crore.
 
 The bid was cleared by the tender scrutiny committee of the civic body. Based on its recommendations, the VMC administration had put up a proposal to construct the six new buildings before the standing committee. The committee gave a nod for the project on Thursday. Work orders will now be issued for the new buildings.
