Be it the dim-witted Putturumees in Soorya Maanasam or the docile eponymous hero in Ponthan Mada,   has truly brought alive the unconventional characters in his films which had the audience rooting for the underdog. 

 For  's upcoming movie, the megastar will be seen, for the first time in his career, playing a 'pint-sized' character.
 The movie's scriptwriter   tells us, 'Mammukka plays a man who is only four feet tall in the movie. He's a special character and we will be using a lot of CGI to show Mammukka as the diminutive person.'
 Benny is no stranger to creating unconventional protagonists; his previous films Kunjikoonan and Chanthupottu had Dileep essaying a hunchback and an effeminate male, respectively. 'This film too is somewhat similar in this regard but it will have a lot of comic elements that one tends to expect from a film directed by Nadirshah,' he says.
 
 The movie will be set against a rural backdrop. 'We will start shooting this year. Currently, we are working on the script and once that's done, the movie will go on floors,' says the scriptwriter.
