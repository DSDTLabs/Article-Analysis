After being stuck in traffic for more than two hours on Day One of the conference, singer   asked the organizing committee to reschedule his session to September 23. On the second day of the YC, the singer kept his promise and reached the college on time for his session. "I have heard so many good things about this college and I was telling my wife the other day that I wanted to study here. But I came to Delhi later in life so I couldn’t study here. But I am happy that I studied in a village where I was surrounded by nature’s beauty. For an artist and his musical pursuits, I think living in such a place really helps," he told the students.

 He then began telling his story and how he formed the music band, Silk Route. "That was a decision that was purely on instinct. One day I took a bus from Himachal Pradesh and left everything to make this band because I wanted to create music. The purpose of the band was not to get famous but to have the creative satisfaction. That was the time when I met music maestro   sir for the first time at an award show (in 1998.) We got the award for the best band and when I saw him, I said, namaskar to him, he asked me if I have done any films yet, I said no. But nothing happened after that, but then one day I got a call from   who asked me to fly to Chennai the next day for a song that he had written for the movie ' '. When I reached Rahman sir’s studio, I was nervous and thought there will be a lot of people around. But I was surprised to see that there was nobody in the studio except me, Rahman sir, Prasoon Joshi and  . That was the time I sang Khoon Chala. I am telling you this so you know that patience is very important in life and when we work hard, we forget the time and energy that we are giving to something and that is really important for your passion," he told everyone.
