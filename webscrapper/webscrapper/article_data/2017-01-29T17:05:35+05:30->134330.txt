VADODARA: City-based   (YFS) which was founded in April 2007 as a nation-wide volunteering movement that inspires youth to volunteer and provides them with meaningful opportunities to serve the community has announced  .

 YFS makes volunteering easy and customized to the individual’s interests, time availability and skill sets.
 
 "There is an undercurrent among the college students in the country to volunteer their time and take up social initiatives. While there is good intent, most of them do not have a support system to make the best use of their time. YFS provides such a platform and has engaged hundreds of college students through ‘Seva vacation’ and other ongoing programs,” said a YFS office-bearer.
 
 "YFS’ vision is a   where there is harmony. And the developmental needs are addressed locally through individuals who act without vested interests. YFS aims to create positive change agents in the society, through the culture of volunteering,” he said.
 
 The organisation has invited nominations for the awards for which the last date is February 10. The   Award ceremony will be held in March.
 
 Youth between the age of 16 to 25 years who have volunteered for at least one year and are active in the last six months are eligible to apply for the awards.
