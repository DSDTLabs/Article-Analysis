AHMEDABAD: Janak Joshi, 52, who lives a lavish life with a bungalow in   in Bopal and five luxury cars, was apprehended at the city airport by crime branch officials for cheating. By boasting about his political contacts and using a spoofing app to mask his cell number and display numbers of high government offices including the MEA, Joshi allegedly cheated several people, including high-ranking government officials, using the lure of promotions, admission to medical colleges, cushy government jobs, government tenders and large loans from banks.

 Crime branch officials said that though only two complainants, for a total of Rs 57 lakh, have come forward against Joshi, the amount swindled could run into crores as he wove his web across UP, Maharashtra, Delhi, Rajasthan, Bihar, Haryana, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu.
 
 
  
 
 The son of a professor, the late Raman Joshi, Janak would threaten victims who demanded their money back by saying that his father was a renowned scholar who had taught many “prominent” political leaders and he would get them fixed in false cases. Joshi’s three brothers are well settled. One of them even owned a grant-in-aid college which he recently leased to someone else. 
 
 According to deputy commissioner of police, crime branch, Deepan Bhadran, Joshi promised Surjeetsingh Bhalla, now an Australian resident, that he would get his son   admitted to DY Patil Medical College in Pune in the MD Radiology course and had already taken Rs 19 lakh of the Rs 80 lakh he had demanded for the job.
 
 “When the admission never came through, Joshi was exposed, ” added DCP Bhadran.
