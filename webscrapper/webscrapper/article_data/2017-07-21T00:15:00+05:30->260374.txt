Panaji: Sunita Verlekar, who was rescued from a confined space in Candolim where she was forced to live in inhumane conditions, is recuperating well at Recolhimento de Serra in Altinho, Panaji.  Recolhimento de Serra is one of the homes of the Institute of Public Assistance (Provedoria) that caters to the welfare of the underprivileged and downtrodden.  No sooner was she brought into the home last week, than caretakers provided her with a fresh set of clothes and trimmed her unkempt hair. Sunita is getting accustomed to sleeping on a bed, but continues to curl up in a foetal position. She also has to be coaxed to drink water.  Caretakers took her to the Goa Medical College and Hospital, Bambolim, on Wednesday for a blood test to establish her overall health. She is being allowed to adjust to her new environment and will soon be taken for an eye exam. “It will take time for her to adjust. She eats by herself and is very cooperative. Her memory is sound and she recalls incidents in her village and school from when she was younger. In no way can she be looked upon as a psychiatric patient. Doctors at the Institute of Psychiatry and Human Behaviour have certified this,” Provedoria director Vinayak Volvoikar, said. Considering Sunita’s traumatic experience, the institute has restricted visitors. “We don’t allow people to ask her questions that will make her relive her ordeal,” he added. Two inmates have also been asked to watch over her and help make the latest entrant to the home fit right in.  Last Wednesday the women’s police station arrested four family members Sunita’s brothers and their wives after rescuing her. Police found her in a locked room outside the house, where she is believed to have been confined for several years. Sources said there was not a piece of cloth found in the room when she was rescued.  NGO Bailancho Saad alerted the police about her condition following a tip-off.
