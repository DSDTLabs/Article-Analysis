LUCKNOW: Three   of   were permitted to appear in the examination on Monday, but only after after created a ruckus. 

 Students reached the examination hall and when they were not allowed to sit in the examination, they started shouting and protesting outside the examination hall. When the students continued their protest, the university allowed them to appear after taking an undertaking from them.
 
 LU's proctorial board has restrained seven students from appearing in their examination on March 9 because of their indiscipline and involvement in activities that disrupted law and order on the campus.
 
 While four students missed their BA travel and tourism and Hindi examination since they had been barred by the board. All seven students were involved in various incidents of indiscipline in the central mess and holding LU vice-chancellor   hostage in August last year.
 
 "Students who did not reply to our notice were stopped from giving examination. They had given reply to the show-cause notice. All three are final year students hence we have also taken an undertaking from them before allowing to appear," said chief proctor Vinod Singh.
