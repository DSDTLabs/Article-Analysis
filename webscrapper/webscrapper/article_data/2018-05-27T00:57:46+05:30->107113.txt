GURUGRAM: A pregnant woman (21) was allegedly drugged and gang-raped by an   driver and his two aides in Manesar earlier this week,   said on Saturday.

 The woman, who was two-and-a-half months into her  , was returning home in a shared autorickshaw from   in   around 2.30pm on May 21 when the incident happened.
 
 According to the woman, when she boarded the autorickshaw, five people were already sitting inside. Three of them got off at the next stop. After covering a distance, the driver pulled down the curtains while one of the two persons sitting on the back seat forced feed her  . And when she fell unconscious, they took her to an isolated place, where the driver and the two passengers raped her, she alleged. She said when she gained her senses after several hours, she found herself alone in a deserted place. Her clothes were not in order and she was feeling severe pain.
 
 The woman, originally from Farrukhabad ( ), worked as a casual worker at a factory in IMT-Manesar. She lives in a village nearby with her husband, who works in another factory as a causal worker.
 
 She said she somehow came to the main road and contacted her husband, who took her home but did not report the matter to the police.
 
 But, her conditions deteriorated as the pain and the bleeding continued over the next two days. Finally, her husband took her to ESIC hospital, where she was admitted on May 23 night. When doctors enquired about her problems, she told them about the gang rape.
 
 The hospital staff then informed police and later referred her to another hospital, where she is still under treatment. 
 
 An FIR was filed under sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 376 (gang rape) and 376D (where a woman is raped by one or more persons constituting a group) of the IPC on Friday. “We are scanning   footage of the area to identify the accused,” said a police officer at the Women’s police station, Manesar.
