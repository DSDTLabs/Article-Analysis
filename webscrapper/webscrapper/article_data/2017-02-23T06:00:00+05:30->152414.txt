The   was the rarest of the 93 species of birds spotted during the   held in   recently. Held jointly by international bird watchers   and  , the survey was conducted between February 18-20. 
 “Being winter time, we recorded lot of migratory birds like pied cuckoo, rosy starling, Blyths reed warbler, barn swallow were also spotted near the water bodies in campus like Peacock Lake and Buffalo Lake. We also spotted a rare bird unique to Indian sub-continent spangled drongo for the first time in campus. Also elusive birds like short-toed snake eagle were also spotted by the members,” said C Siva Raju, a Neuroscience student and member of Rohith Vemula Science Club.
  More than 25 student volunteers from   participated in the survey which was split into morning and evening sessions. The team covered over three fourth of the 1700-plus acre campus. 
 Previously 109 bird species were spotted in the survery conducted in the campus. The decline in the number of bird species is a result of loss of habitat caused by rampant construction undertaken on campus say students. “It’s high time we put an end to the devastation on UoH to save the flora and fauna of the campus,” said Sandeep, PhD Regional Studies. 
 The participants rued the decline in numbers of birds like Siberian rubythroat and paddy field wabbler. “The campus harbours several endangered species and also helps to recharge the water levels of nearby residential areas. We need to end the menace of unplanned construction which is fast turning our beautiful campus into a concrete jungle,” said a member of the faculty who didn’t want to be named.
