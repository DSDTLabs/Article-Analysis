Panaji: Poor demand for low-grade iron ore and the February 7 Supreme Court order directing the closure of mining operations led to a 58% drop in iron ore production in Goa in the quarter ending March 31, mining giant Vedanta said on Wednesday. In Goa, production and sales of iron ore during the quarter stood at 1.5 MT (million tonne) and 2.4 MT, respectively, the company said in its filing to stock exchanges. Vedanta’s iron ore production in Goa for the period January-March 2017 stood at 3.7 MT, while sales of iron ore were 2.3 MT in the same period. On an annual basis, production of iron ore from the conglomerate’s mines in Goa fell by 44% in FY2018 to 4.9 MT, while sales also dropped from 7.4MT in FY2017 to 5.4MT in FY2018. “The production volumes were lower year-on-year primarily due to lower demand for low grade ore and mine closure pursuant to a Supreme Court judgement,” the company said. The apex court, in an order dated February 7, 2018, cancelled the renewal of 88 mining leases and directed the state government to stop mining operations with effect from March 16. Vedanta said that the Supreme Court’s judgement would require a review of the value of the company’s assets which would reflect in the FY2018 financial results. “In light of the Supreme Court judgement wherein the court has directed that mining operations in Goa are to be stopped, there could be a likely impairment of Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 1,800 crore net of taxes (Rs 2,100 crore to Rs 2,400 crore gross of taxes) on this account. This is mainly related to mining reserve and would be reflected in the results for FY 2017-18,” the company statement said. Vedanta assured its investors that the closure of the group’ s iron ore business in Goa will not have any material impact on the group's profitability. “At Karnataka, our annual mining allocation is likely to increase by early first quarter of FY2019 on account of the Supreme Court cap increase for the state from 30 to 35 million tonnes,” Vedanta said.
