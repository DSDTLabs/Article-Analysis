VADODARA: A committee constituted by M   to probe the alleged misbehaviour of a group of student leaders who had last week thrown trimmed grass and vegetation outside the chamber of university registrar at head office, condemned the behaviour of student leaders.

 The committee on Wednesday registered statements of all the five student leaders who are accused of misbehaviour at the university head office. The university officials have already suspended two student leaders and also registered a FIR against the five. 
 
 “Based on the committee’s report which is expected on Thursday further action will be taken,” said   registrar  . 
 
 The university’s decision has however resulted in major protests by all student outfits who have demanded that the university should revoke the suspension of two student leaders. The student leaders had threw the trimmed grass and vegetation to register their protest against the inaction of university officials who despite several representations had not bothered to clean up the vegetation in girls hostel premises. Student outfits on Wednesday too staged protest against the university’s decision. 
 
 An   leader  , who had reached the head office to support the protest, had come face to face with the university’s vigilance staff.
