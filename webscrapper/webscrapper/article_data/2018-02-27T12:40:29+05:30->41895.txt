Trichy: As a part of the ongoing nationwide campaign ‘IMA Bharat Yatra’ organised by   (IMA) to shed a light on the alleged shortcomings of the drafted   ( ) Bill 2017, members of   Trichy branch conducted a meeting and took part in the yatra.

 NMC Bill seeks to replace the existing   (MCI) and reform the medical education sector and end corruption in the medical sector.
 
 Former president of IMA, Dr  , who was present in the city for the yatra, spoke about how NMC Bill can lead to adverse effects. During the meet at IMA campus in the city, Aggarwal stated that the basic purpose of the yatra was to create momentum against NMC Bill, which he claimed to be ‘anti-poor’ and ‘anti-federal.’ He went on to add that a state like   would face negative effects due to it. 
 
 “According to the bill, NMC would consist of only 25 members- out of which, the majority would be nominated from the government and only the remaining would be elected. This means there is a possibility that TN might not have even one representative for medical education even for 10 years,” he told TOI.
 
  Aggarwal also claimed that if the Bill is passed, it would mean that one doesn't need to get permission to start a new medical college. “By doing this, how can they say they would curb corruption? This means, for five years, a newly-opened college can decide the number of medical seats as per their own protocol,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, Dr M S Ashraf, former national vice president of IMA said, “According to the proposed bill, traditional medicine practitioners can become like any other MBBS doctor just by undergoing a six-month bridge course,” he said.
