SECUNDERABAD: Over 200 walkers held a protest on Friday morning against the state government's proposal to construct a new   on Parade Ground land in Secunderabad. Walkers expressed concern that they will lose a lung space if the state government goes ahead with its plan. Thousands use Parade Ground every day for morning walk and other physical exercises. 

 The Parade Ground is also used for celebrating state and national events like Independence Day, Republic Day, Telangana State Formation Day. 
 
 "State government's request to the Centre to allot Parade Ground for a new Secretariat complex is meaningless. The present Secretariat is big enough and its location is convenient for people to visit it for their official work. If government wants bigger one, it can dismantle the   and construct new buildings," Krishank, official spokesperson of the   who led the protest told TOI. The   (MoD) has to rethink the Telangana government's proposal.
