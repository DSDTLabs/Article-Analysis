KOLKATA: Environment-friendly electric vehicles seem to be the way forward in  , especially in areas where public vehicles do not ply currently. While   is set to introduce three 32-seater electric buses in a few weeks, an app-based car rental company is considering to launch self-driven electric vehicles on a public hiring scheme. 

 Officials said trial run of the three air-conditioned electric buses, procured by Hidco and Coal India, had started. A panel, comprising Hidco and NKDA officials and a public vehicles representative, has been set up to draft the routes, schedule, travel distance and permissible speed. 
 
  An app-based car rental company also had a discussion with NKDA on the possibility of introducing self-driven electric vehicles on a public hiring scheme. Another company also had a meeting about the launch of electric three-wheelers, to be hired on apps.
