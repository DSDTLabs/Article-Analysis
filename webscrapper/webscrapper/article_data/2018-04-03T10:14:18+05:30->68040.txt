KOCHI: India football legend   is certainly not happy with the step-motherly treatment shown by   ( ) to country’s national football championship.

 
 When Kerala won their sixth   title defeating West Bengal in tie-breaker in the final in Kolkata on Sunday, majority of football fans in Kerala missed the occasion as there was no live television coverage of the match. “I don’t know why AIFF is doing this. Whether this tournament has lost its charm or not is not even a question. Santosh Trophy is still India’s national football tournament and it is the responsibility of the national football association to arrange a live telecast of at least the final. Doordarshan’s sports channel was running the highlights of last Commonwealth Games at the time of Santosh Trophy final,” said a fuming Vijayan who added that AIFF needs to learn from Indian Super League organisers on how to market a football tournament.
 
 “I will not say that ISL has done a lot to improve the standard of Indian football but they have made football more popular in India through clever marketing. AIFF should seriously takes some lessons on football marketing from ISL,” he added.
 
 Vijayan was also critical of the timing of the matches as this year’s Santosh Trophy in Kolkata saw a very low spectator turnout. “I saw several posts saying that if the tournament was conducted in Kerala instead of Kolkata, the stadium would have been flooded with fans. Nothing will happen if the matches start at 2.30 in the afternoon. Kolkata is hotter than Kerala and the organisers are playing with player’s health by starting matches in the afternoon,” he said.
