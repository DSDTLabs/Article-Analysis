NAGPUR: The   (NMC) has taken up   project as a remedial measure to clean up the waste lying at  . The civic body, which will be spending over Rs100 crore, has awarded the contract for it to a Chandrapur-based private agency. However, the reliability of the process is itself under a cloud. 

 A feasibility study conducted by German experts on the city’s waste management last year had categorically questioned the efficacy of the process. “The technology faces challenges because of incidences of huge fire and odour issues,” it stated.
 
 The study was a part of the ‘Urban Nexus project’ financed by the German Federal ministry of economic cooperation and development. In India, two cities were selected for the project — Nagpur and Rajkot. NMC and the German agency had agreed to study the solid waste management problem in detail and come up with an economically feasible solution.
 
 The study estimated that more than 18,00,000 metric tonne of unsegregated waste, which is equivalent to 180 crore kilograms, has been dumped at the site since its inception in 1966. “The dump site is subject to frequent fires and has been causing air pollution, odour nuisance and has an adverse impact on the nearby residents. This has raised questions about the operations of the dump site,” the study stated.
 
 It added that the lack of market for compost and soil derived from the process has affected the bio-mining project. Earlier, TOI had reported that as per experts, segregating the waste is must for bio-mining. 
 
 TOI had recently collected water samples from nearby areas and got them tested at a private laboratory. Results showed that the groundwater was highly contaminated. The German study had also warned of the risk of leachate percolation.
 
 Citing that the percentage of organic waste and moisture content in the city’s waste is very high, the study pointed out that incineration-based processes are unviable at Bhandewadi. It also ruled out the process of biomethanation in which organic material is converted to biogas under anaerobic conditions. “It is a highly sensitive technology and cannot be suggested for processing the waste in Nagpur. The technology can be used only for segregated waste,” the study stated. 
 
 Recommending a mechanical-biological treatment for the city’s municipal solid waste, the study had proposed implementation of Maximum Yield Technology (MYT) which extracts raw material and energy content from the waste. The study also highlighted the various steps involved in the technology which included mechanical pre-treatment, biological step, biological drying, mechanical material separation, discharged air treatment and water treatment (see infographics). 
 
 As per the recommendations, treating 800 tonnes of waste using the MYT technology would have generated 8.36 megawatt of energy and 213 tonnes per day of refuse derived fuel ( ).
 
 The experts who conducted the study had also identified cement plants where the generated RDF could have been used. 
 
 NMC officials said that the German agencies had initially proposed to implement the technology in Nagpur but there was “no follow-up from their end”. “It is not known what why the NMC did not pursue the matter and instead chose to go in for bio-mining,” said sources in the civic body.

 Published | July 2017
 
 Aim | To find a feasible solution to tackle the problem of solid waste management
 
 Observations | 
 
 - Segregation of waste at source is not practised by the generators
 
 - Dump site at poses various risks to human health due to fire, leachate percolation and air pollution
 
 - More than 18 lakh metric tonne (180 crore kgs) of unsegregated waste lying at Bhandewadi
 
 - Detailed analysis of weighbridge data revealed that average daily collection of waste is 1,119 tonnes per day
 
 - Bio-mining faces challenges because of incidences of huge fire and odour issues
 
 Suggestions | 
 
 - Implementation of Maximum Yield Technology 
 
 - It extracts raw material and energy content from the waste
 
 MYT | Steps involved
 
 - Mechanical pre-treatment: Breaks down the waste in different sizes depending on the material
 
 - Biological step: Addition of process water to ensure uniform consistency
 
 - Biological Drying: Drying waste in an energy-efficient and economical way
 
 - Mechanical material separation: Breaking down dry, very homogenous and free-flowing material into various sub-fractions
 
 - Discharged air treatment: Polluted discharged air is captured and recycled again
 
 - Water treatment: Sending process water to waste water treatment plant
