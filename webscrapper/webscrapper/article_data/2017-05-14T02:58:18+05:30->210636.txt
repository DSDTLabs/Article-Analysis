 Answering children’s queries about kitchen hygiene, Ukey said, “Raw materials, which arrive from Butibori factory of Dominos, are thoroughly checked.” Hygiene, great pizza experience and hospitality are our priorities, he added.
 
 Krita Naithani, an NFK Club member, said that making a pizza was as enjoyable as eating one. She further added, “Watching dough and toppings transform into a baked pizza is the coolest thing I have ever seen.”
 
 Shift manager Kamlesh Mishra said that the workshop would help boost children’s confidence.
