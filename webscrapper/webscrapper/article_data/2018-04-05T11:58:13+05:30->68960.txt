PUNE: Two   appointed by   (MSRTC) are going around   in Pune and giving a patient hearing to depot managers and drivers in a bid to identify employees troubled by various problems, both professional and personal, and offer a solution to them.

 Speaking to TOI earlier, Srinivas Joshi, divisional controller of Pune division, said that one-to-one meetings with the identified staff members, particularly drivers, will begin soon. Joshi has now been transferred to a different division.
 
 “The counsellors were appointed last month and they have started work. They are moving to different depots and meeting depot managers first and seeking information about drivers and conductors. There are a few drivers and conductors who do not report for work regularly. We need to know why they remain absent from work frequently and if at all there are any psychological or social problems faced by them,” the official said.
 
 He said that group meetings with drivers and conductors of all depots will be held first.
 
 “The counsellors will first hold group meetings and encourage them to voice their problems. However, most of them are on duty at any given point in time so after these meetings, the depot managers will be consulted as they will be in a better position to identify individuals. The meetings will also help them identify those facing problems,” the official pointed out.
