GUWAHATI: The   (AGP), a   ally in  , decided to move a resolution against the Centre’s proposed Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, at a special cabinet meeting convened by chief minister   on Friday to discuss the crisis concerning the legislation. 

 
 AGP has three ministers in the cabinet and internal division over its resolution would signal trouble for the ruling alliance of BJP, AGP and Bodoland People’s Front (BPF). Should AGP leave the alliance, the BJP-BPF coalition would survive, but with 73 members against 87 with AGP, in the 126-member assembly.
