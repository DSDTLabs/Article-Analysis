KOLKATA: A 6km-tall column of cumulonimbus cloud cut off sunlight, leavng the city dark before noon on Thursday. It triggered a spell of heavy downpour that lasted over an hour, leaving extensive parts of the city waterlogged. Traffic came to a halt at several important junctions, including Esplanade and Maa flyover. With 38.8mm of rain on Thursday, it is the wettest March in a decade. The Met office predicted rain on Friday as well, adding that the wet spell could last till March 12.

 “While thundershowers are not uncommon in March, there has rarely been such a steady wet spell in Kolkata during the first half of the month,” said  , director,   (RMC).
 
 The unusually tall cloud column had been formed by heavy moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal, aided by a cyclonic circulation that extended from Jharkhand and   to parts of south Bengal. “It is a big system that is now slowly moving in a north-east direction. It will continue to trigger thundershowers and rain across south   and the neighbouring states. By the weekend, it could even cause rainfall in north Bengal. Kolkata and its surrounding areas could receive thundershowers over the weekend,” said Das.
 
 The cloud column on Thursday was similar to the one that had formed on Wednesday. “A high-pressure zone exists over Bay of Bengal. It has been infusing moisture, leading to the repeated formation of clouds in and around Kolkata.”
 
 “Cloud columns like Wednesday’s and Thursday’s are common during the pre-monsoon period when moisture incursion is high. During monsoon, we rarely have them, unless there’s a big system like the one we have now,” explained Das. 
 
 On Thursday, the cloud column hovered above the city for close to an hour, plunging the city into near darkness for about 10 minutes bet-ween 11.25am and 11.35am. Traffic came to a crawl and office-goers scampered for cover in the rain.
