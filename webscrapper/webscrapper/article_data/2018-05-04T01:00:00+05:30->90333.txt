 had taken up the second season of the popular TV show 'Laado', titled '  — Veerpur Ki Mardaani', with high hopes. In fact, she had turned down several offers to give her nod to the project. Not only did it fail to meet her expectations, the show also didn’t garner good ratings. It is now slated to go off air on May 25. Avika says, “I haven’t been officially informed about the last date of telecast, but yes, I have heard that the show is going to end soon.”

 Too many changes in the storyline also made it difficult for the audience to connect with it. Avika says, “Initially, I was in awe of my character, Anushka, who is a strong, independent and educated woman. I have always wanted to be play an inspiring character. However, the script that was narrated to me turned out to be different from what unfolded. Too many changes were made too soon. According to the original script, Ammaji (Meghna Malik) was supposed to die after four months, following which Anushka would step into her shoes. However, Ammaji's character died in just a month. Soon after, Yuvraj (Shaleen Malhotra) was killed on the show and a new guy (Siddharth Arora) was roped in opposite me. The shift from Veerpur to Chandigarh, too, was abrupt.” 
 
 Avika found her role so unconvincing that she had apparently expressed a desire to quit the show a month ago. While she refuses to comment on the subject, she says, “Every day, I had to convince myself to relate to the character. There have been scenes where I wondered why Anushka would behave the way she did, given that she is a lawyer. There was no logic to what I was doing. Had they told me that this show, too, would be like my previous show ' ', which was all about 'chudails' and 'daayans', I wouldn’t have questioned them on the logic. In short, I didn’t expect the story to turn out the way it did. But then, it’s a huge brand and I have learnt a lot from the experience.”
