NEW DELHI: VHP working president   on Monday threatened to reignite the movement for construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya if the Narendra Modi government failed to bring in a legislation in Parliament on the issue, as promised by the BJP. 

 At a press conference, Togadia accused the Modi government of doing a "U-turn" on the Ram temple issue. "The government had been promising to bring a law in Parliament to construct a temple at Ayodhya, since it came to office in May 2014. But in the last six months, it has been saying that the court which is hearing the issue, will resolve the matter." 
 
 "This change in stand of the Modi government is a U-turn," he said.
 
 Hitting out at Modi just a month before the BJP-led government is to complete four years in office, Togadia said, "It looks like the government has gone back on its words and now the fear is that the issue will once again be raked up by the BJP only to return to power."
 
 "There may be another diluted agitation soon, just to paint all other parties anti-Hindu and grab Hindu votes. Hindus did agitation, died, many went to jail for years, for Ram temple. Now the case is in court, why should there be any agitation just to grab Hindu votes again," Togadia said.
 
 He demanded that the government "pass a law on Ram Temple without any delay and stop fooling the majority". "Modi has not been able to deliver either on development - with farmers' distress, unemployment, rising prices etc - or on Ram Temple," he said.
