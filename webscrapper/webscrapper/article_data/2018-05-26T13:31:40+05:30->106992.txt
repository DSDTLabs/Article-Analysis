The quality of milk or fat which determines the content of protein and calcium has to go through checks at three levels—cooperatives, block and school level,” said a government official.
 
 The monitoring of milk consumption will made on the daily basis. The headmaster or the principal of the school has to share the milk consumption data to the district education officer via SMS who has to compile it and upload on daily basis before 4pm on Mid-Day meal (MDM) website. The money for the milk will be paid by MDM commissioner office on monthly basis. "The responsibility of serving milk will be shared by the manpower who are engaged in MDM," said the official.
