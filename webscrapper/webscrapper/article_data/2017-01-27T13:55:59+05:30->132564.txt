  That's the reason why the show Dil   was created. Being an Ishqbaaaz spin-off, the show will highlight the lives of   and  . Actors   Jaising, Nakuul Mehta, and   have their own fan following and some of these fans were very upset that their favorite actors are hardly getting any screen time.
  
  
 
  
  Dil Bole Oberoi is also the solution for them as Kunal and   will be taking up a majority of the screen time here. The first promo of the show is here and its really well made. Take a look at the promo here-
