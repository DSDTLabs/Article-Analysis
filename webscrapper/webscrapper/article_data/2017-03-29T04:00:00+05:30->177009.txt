Chennai: Homestay network Stayzilla co-founder and CEO Yogendra Vasupal, who has been jailed since March 14, was denied bail on Tuesday.

 Vasupal was arrested after ad agency Jigsaw Advertising filed a case for being defrauded of Rs1.72 crore. Vasupal’s ‘admitted liability’ became the basis for rejection of his bail petition before principal sessions judge Nazeer Ahamed. This is the second time Vasupal's bail petition has been dismissed, after a special metropolitan magistrate court of CB-CID did the same on March 24.
 
 Vasupal admitted to have used the services of the complainant, thereafter the company was closed, and thereafter he claims to have received a funding of Rs94 crore. In spite of receiving that money he did not pay dues to the complainant, which prima facie shows his intention to cheat, the complainant’s counsel Abbudukumar Rajarathinam quoted the court as saying.
 
 The judge also accepted the argument that the second accused, Stayzilla co-founder Sachit Singhi, is not eligible for anticipatory bail. Police are currently on the lookout for Singhi. Vasupal is lodged in Puzhal jail. Stayzilla recently shut operations over cash flow problems. Earlier it had raised $34 million in four rounds. But in February, Stayzilla suspended operations and said it will be restructuring itself and relaunch in a new avatar.
