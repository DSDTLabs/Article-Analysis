JAIPUR: The   (NIA), which investigated the   case, seeks more time to file reports on the suspects and absconders in the case. The court gave April 3 for filing the report.

 The NIA court while sentencing two of the accused, Devendra Gupta and Bhavesh Patel to  , had asked the agency to either file closure report or charge-sheet those who were initially named as suspects but failed to file charges against them. 
 
 While NIA had charge-sheeted 13 people in connection with the case, three persons are still absconding. The court had acquitted seven persons and three were found guilty. While the NIA said one of the absconders, while the NIA filed report that   is no more alive, investigation is still pending against Ramesh Venkatrao Mahalkar and Suresh Nair.
 
 However no other suspects in the case namely Pragya Singh, Samandar , Jayanti Bhai and   there is no reference of the investigation pending nor closure report. 
 
 The court said, the NIA in its report on February 21 this year had given a clean chit to these suspects and made its intention clear that it is not interested to carry on with the investigation.
 
 The court said if the NIA could not find sufficient material to charge these people it should file a report under Section 169 of CRPC (release of accused when evidence deficient) or report the court on completion of investigation.
