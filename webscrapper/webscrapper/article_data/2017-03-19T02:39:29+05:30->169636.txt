GURUGRAM: Bridegrooms in Hathin and Mewat will now have to give an affidavit stating they have a   in their house if they seek a bride. If the groom fails to produce one, the Qazis won’t go ahead with the  . This decision was made by the Ulemas, a body of Muslim scholars specialising in Islamic law, from Mewat and Hathin. 

 Around 700 villagers from Hathin, Palwal and Mewat took part in a panchayat at Mamolaka village in Palwal on Friday, where the Ulemas decided that grooms will have to give bride’s family an affidavit stating that they have a toilet in theuir houses. Failing to do so, the marriage won’t be solemnised. TOI had reported on February 12 that around 110 villages from the three states —  , Punjab and Himachal Pradesh — unanimously decided to not marry their daughters into households which do not have toilets. Seeking affidavits from the groom is a step further to ensure that no deceit is done while taking a bride home.
 
 “We have decided to ensure that the no girl is married into a house without a toilet. Our sisters and daughters will not defecate in the open. It is unsafe because they do so in the dark or at isolated places and it is also derogatory for their gender. So unless the groom gives an affidavit of having the provisions of a lavatory at home, the nikaah ceremony will not take place,” said Maulana Mohammed Yahya Karimi, head of North India Jamiyat Ulema-E-Hind.
 
 Not only this, the ban on liquor consumption and DJ music at weddings to check overheads, the burden of which often fall on brides' families, continues. To impose the strictness, it has been decided that the Qazis will not go ahead with the formalities of nikaah, if these restrictions are violated.
