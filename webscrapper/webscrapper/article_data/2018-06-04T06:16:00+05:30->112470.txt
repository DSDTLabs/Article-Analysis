GHAZIABAD: Zaid’s parents had resigned to their fate. On Sunday, the discovery of his body “opened up an old wound”.

 
 Shock gradually gave way to grief for the family as the clothes that were on the body matched the ones four-year-old   was wearing the day he went missing on December 2016. Zaid’s mother,  , was inconsolable while his siblings were yet to come to terms with the revelation.
 
 “Nazreen had gradually stopped expecting any miracle over the span of 18 months. The discovery of his body has opened up an old wound which will now be difficult to heal for the rest of her life,” Zaid’s uncle,  , said.
 
 The family said they had put in their best efforts to arrange for the Rs 8 lakh ransom, taking loans from friends and relatives.
 
 “We never presumed Zaid could have been killed. We had made several trips to the police station even after the two ransom callers were sent to jail. Each time, the police would assure us that an investigation is underway and Zaid would be recovered sooner or later. I had even got information that somebody like Zaid had been seen in Allahabad and Lucknow on two occasions. I had visited the cities and handed over applications to the local police,” Zaid’s father, Nazar, said.
 
 Zaid was last seen sitting on the steps leading to the verandah of their house and nibbling an apple.
 
 “He was unwell the day he went missing. He had come downstairs around 6pm and asked his mother to serve him roti. But his mother had asked him to have an apple instead since he was ill. He went out joyfully with the apple in his hand. He was munching on the apple on the verandah steps when he was last seen,”  , a relative, said.
