HYDERABAD: Former minister and   politburo member   has come out openly in favour of an alliance between the T-TDP and the TRS in   for the 2019 polls. 

 Narasimhulu on Friday said N   should tour Telangana to strengthen the T-TDP. He blamed   for bringing disrepute to Naidu through the infamous cash-for-vote scam. "Most of the TDP leaders who were given political life by the party's founder NT   are now in TRS. It would be a tribute to NTR if T-TDP allies with TRS," he said. tnn
