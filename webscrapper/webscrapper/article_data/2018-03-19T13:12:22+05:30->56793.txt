 Speaking to TOI, Christopher Gibbons, Consul General of Canada, while marching with an Indian and Canadian flag said, "Being able to express who you are is fundamental to human beings. If we are not free to express who we are in terms of sexuality and gender identity, then equality does not mean anything at all. If some people are excluded from that, then it's an empty shell and for the well-being of the whole society, it is necessary that we are all inclusive. Canada is very proud to reach out to the community and tell the members that we are all the same." Known names from the LGBT movement in the city and other places like Dhananjay Mamgalmukhi, a Panjab University student and Transgender Rights Activist, along with Aditya Bandopadhyay, a Delhi- based lawyer and an LGBT Rights Activist were present.
