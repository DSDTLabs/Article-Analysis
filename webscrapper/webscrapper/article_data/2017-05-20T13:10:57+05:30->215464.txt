MUMBAI: Two men who had taken a flight to   from Sahar airport on Tuesday were deported on Thursday for allegedly travelling on fake travel and work documents. 

  The men -   (29) and   (25) - who are from Lucknow were arrested after they landed at Sahar airport on Thursday night. They have been remanded in police custody till May 22. The police said that while the two men had gone abroad in the hope of improving the financial condition of their impoverished families, they have now ended up becoming poorer by Rs 80,000 which had been paid to the travel agent. While Rafique was to take up a carpenter's job, Hafeez was to work as a tailor.
 
 The police said that the two men came under the scanner of airport officials in the Gulf as they had left India on travel visas, but showed work visas on landing in Sharjah. "Travelling on two visas is in itself illegal. Also, in this case both visas that each of them had were fake," said a police officer, adding that the two men have claimed ignorance that their travel documents were not genuine.
 
 Rafique and Hafeez's travel agent in Lucknow had provided them visas and appointment letters for their jobs. "They managed to clear the immigration check at the Mumbai airport, but were caught at Sharjah when officials there found that they had travelled on tourist visas from Mumbai, but had shown work visas after landing there," said senior inspector BT Mukhedkar of Sahar police station. "Besides, their visas were fake." 
 
 Sub-inspector   said they will now try and track down the agent who issued fake visas and job documents to the two men. 
 
 "The men say they know the agent," said Dudale. Rafique and Hafeez have been booked under sections dealing with cheating, and using forged documents as genuine under the Indian Penal Code.
