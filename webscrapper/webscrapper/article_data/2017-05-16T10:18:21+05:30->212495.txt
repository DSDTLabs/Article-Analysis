 Tom Albanese, CEO, Vedanta Ltd, said the company's strategic focus to ramp up production across the portfolio, namely zinc, aluminium, power and iron ore businesses, has supplemented revenue growth.

Our cost management initiatives have helped us deliver strong returns for all our shareholders," he added.
