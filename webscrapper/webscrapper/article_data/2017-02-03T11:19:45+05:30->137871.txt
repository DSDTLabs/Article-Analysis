UJJAIN: A small hillock about 10km from Ujjain city, once known for animal sacrifices, could be home to the country’s first owl conservation park.

 Hamukhedi hillock, which houses a famous temple, has always been known for its large population of owls. Forest officials are carrying out an intensive survey in the area to ascertain the feasibility of turning it into a sanctuary.
 
 Sub-divisional officer of forests Anubha Trivedi told TOI that the Hamukhedi hillock seems to be an “ideal spot” for developing an owl conservation park. The 15-20-acre area of the hillock has plenty of tendu (East Indian ebony) trees that are favourite perches for owls.
 
 The temple on the hillock attracts large numbers of devotees on weekends. Their offerings feed and breed massive numbers of mice. It’s easy pickings for owls. “The forested locality has abundant food for owls,” she said, adding that the area they have selected has around 10,000 trees, enough for a park to be developed.
 
 Ornithologist   said owls have been often seen in and around Ujjain. “The state biodiversity board listed owls in 2007. Mostly the Indian eagle owl, spotted owl, barn owl (the most common) and scops owl are found here,” he said.
 
 Of late, owls are being illegally captured by people indulging in tantric rituals, he rued. Black magic practitioners use owls and their body parts like skull, bones, blood, claws, eyes, beak, liver, kidney, meat and eggshells in different rituals. Owls are covered by the Wild Life Protection Act but rampant poaching is threatening their survival. A sanctuary may give them the much-needed protection,   hoped.
 
 Owls are also spotted in Garghkalika, Narsingh Ghat and near the Bhartrihari caves, but the largest population is seen in Hamakhedi. Trivedi said a proposal for the owl conservation park will soon be sent to the state government.
