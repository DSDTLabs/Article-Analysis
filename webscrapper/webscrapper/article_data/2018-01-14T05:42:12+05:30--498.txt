 (IDUKKI): Every day, starting from late afternoon when the heat lets up to long after the sun goes down, several herds of elephants that roam the Malayattur and   forest divisions make a beeline for a particular spot along   at Anakulam, about 40 kilometres from Adimali. Instead of wading in and splashing themselves, which is what elephants normally do as soon as they spot water, here the jumbos are content slaking their thirst. 

 Forest officials confirm that the discharge from the oru, or spring located in the river, is mineral rich and has a saline taste which the elephants relish. People residing in the area said that the wild elephants are somehow aware that the water from the spring is precious and should not be wasted. That could be the reason they only drink and don't take a dip. This spot is also unique in that multiple herds arrive simultaneously, with each awaiting its turn to drink, though rare fights do occur. 
 
 Experts say there is no other spot in Kerala's forests where similar   is witnessed.
 
 Interestingly, there has never been man-animal conflict in this area. However, things have started to change and local residents are worried. Anakulam is steadily gaining popularity as a tourist attraction and tourists headed for Munnar have started visiting the river too. The main harassment is for herds arriving at night, as tourists flash headlights of vehicles from the opposite bank in order to get a better view of the elephants. There is also revelry, all of which has forced the elephants to assume intimidating postures. The forest department has put up boards warning visitors against engaging in activities that make the elephants wary. There is also demand from nature lovers to declare Anakulam a biodiversity hotspot and for carrying out a scientific study of the spring water.
