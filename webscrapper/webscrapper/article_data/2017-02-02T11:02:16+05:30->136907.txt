GHAZIABAD: While the venue for Akhilesh Yadav’s poll rally in Ghaziabad on Wednesday was jam-packed with supporters climbing on top of boundary walls and buildings to get his glimpse,  , a close confidante of SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav, also shared the dais for the function.

 Malik, a local SP functionary who is also a member of the UP Legislative Council, is known for his influence on the Yadav family.
 
 A traffic jam, meanwhile, was witnessed on NH-24 right outside the venue when crowds milled out soon after the meeting. 
 
 However, the jams did not spill over into the city unlike the occasion when snarls were reported from all over Ghaziabad during the Haj House inaugural function. Akhilesh was escorted by a fleet of cars to Police Lines in Ghaziabad from where he flew out of the city in a chopper.
 
 An SP worker in Ghaziabad told TOI that Ashu Malik’s sharing the stage with Akhilesh means the father-son feud is ebbing away. “Mulayam and Akhilesh could be heading for a reconciliation now,” he said.
