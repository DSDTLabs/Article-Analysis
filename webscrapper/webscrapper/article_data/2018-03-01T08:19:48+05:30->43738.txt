BENGALURU: Seeking to dispel apprehensions over using EVMs and   from Uttar Pradesh and   in the   assembly elections, state chief electoral officer Sanjiv Kumar on Wednesday said they would be deployed based on requirement, availability and other logistics like transportation.

 “There is neither specific statewise allocation or quota of EVMs and VVPATs (Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail) nor are there any designated EVMs for each state. To say that EVMs and VVPATs from Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat are deliberately being sent to Karnataka is wrong. The   always strives to ensure a sufficient element of randomness in allocating these machines to states,’’ Kumar said.
 
 Of the 85,650 EVMs required, 67,650 will come from Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh and the remaining 18,000-odd from Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Public Sector Unit BEL. Around 85% VVPATs being used in Karnataka are new, Kumar added. Taking exception some media reports casting aspersions on the   for using EVMs and VVPATs from UP and Gujarat, Kumar said these machines cannot be tampered with and this has been proved time and again.
 
 
 
 
 Since VVPATs are being used in all polling booths this time, 20% more civic staff are required for election duty. “Earlier, we needed four persons per booth and now we need one more to monitor VVPATs. In all, we may need 3.25 lakh staff , 50,000 more than the 2013 polls,’’ he added.
