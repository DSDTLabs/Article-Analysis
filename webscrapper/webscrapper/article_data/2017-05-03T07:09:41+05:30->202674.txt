AHMEDABAD:   Desai, 35, daughter of   leader, retired IPS officer V V Rabari, filed a complaint against her husband, Keyur, at Woman Police Station (W) in Vastrapur on Tuesday night. The complaint has been filed under IPC sections 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) and 506 (2) (criminal intimidation) along with sections of Dowry Prohibition Act .

 Rashesha was recently in news when she moved to   last week seeking police protection from her father and husband fearing ‘honour killing’ as they did not want her to pursue her profession of yoga trainer as it did not confirm to the ‘so-called norms and rules of the community’.
 
 Confirming the development, Panna Momaya, ACP (woman), said that they had recorded Rashesha’s complaint. “Further probe will take place in the case,” she said.
 
 While Rashesha was not available for comment, sources in the police said that Rashesha had taken back her application after the talks of truce. However, Keyur had blocked her locker access in the bank where he is a director. She had also alleged him of high-handedness in other issues. The incident in question took place recently at her relative’s residence where she is staying at the moment. The estranged couple had heated exchange of words during which he threanted her of dire consequences. 
 
 Rashesha had earlier mentioned that friction had started after her success as a yoga coach. Keyur had allegedly threatened to divorce her.
 
  Sources added that after she approached the HC, there were efforts for reconciliation but the couple could not reach truce. Police would look into the allegations and have asked the complainant to furnish the details of the harassment and threat.
