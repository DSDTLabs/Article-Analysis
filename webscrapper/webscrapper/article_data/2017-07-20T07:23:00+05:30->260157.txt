Ludhiana: Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) president Sunil Jakhar on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government for what he called “the ill planned” implementation of GST in the country. 

 Speaking to mediapersons here on Wednesday, Jakhar said, “The Congress is against the way GST has been implemented in the country. Everything has been done in an unplanned way. Moreover, instead of fixing one tax rate so many tax slabs which go as high as 28% and even more have been slapped on the businessmen. The worst part is that the enforcement agencies and taxation authorities have been given so much power that they can misuse these to harass businessmen,” he said. 
 
 Jakhar added that the PM was so adamant to implement GST that he did not even think once before taxing small-time businessmen, who couldn’t even complete formalities for GST. “What is even more surprising is that I have come to know that he has even levied GST on charkha,” he said
 
 On the issue of exemption to the textile industry from GST, Jakhar said that the demand was justified and Congress was discussing this issue at the top level. “Soon a decision would be taken by the party on how to raise the issue and get fulfilled the demands of textile businessmen. Jakhar said that the Congress was completely with the businessmen and traders and the leaders would not leave any stone unturned to help them oppose and fight the draconian laws enacted by the Union government.
