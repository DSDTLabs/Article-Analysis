HYDERABAD: The registration department introduced the   system for the convenience of the public and also to put an end to fake challans and demand drafts as well as ensure hassle-free registrations. But in reality, it has become a boon for brokers and staff of sub-registrar offices to mint money on the sly. After introducing the echallan system in April 2016, the common man's problems in fact multiplied due to several reasons. For payments through e-challans, banks and the respective sub-registrar office have to clear the challan payments. The allegations are that only 20 to 30 e-challans a day are being cleared by the   and sub-registrar office. Even those clearances are being done by the bank staff over a period of two to three hours whereas it should not take more than 15 minutes.

 “It has become a herculean task for people to generate echallan for payment. When people approach the registrar offices and banks, they blame each other for the delay . In contrast, document writers get these things done immediately, clearly indicating the nexus between them, bank and revenue officials and brokers," Buggarapu Ramnath, a software engineer and a resident of Malkajgiri, said.
 
 Until last year, people who registered their properties had to go to State Bank of Hyderabad (now SBI) to pay stamp duty. The government also accepted demand drafts.The e-challan system replaced all these to check fake and tampered challans and demand drafts. “At present, we have joint servers for AP and Telangana and that is leading to hardware problems. We have taken up the issue with  ," joint inspector general of registrations department V Srinivasulu said.
