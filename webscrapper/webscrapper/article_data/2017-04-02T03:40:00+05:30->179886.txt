Nagpur: “Start your day every day by remembering Lord Shri Ram and transform His remembrance into your voice,” said noted littérateur Leena Rastogi on Friday. She was speaking at the concluding function of a three-day lecture series on ‘Prabhate Mani Ram Chintit Jawa’ organized by Shri Siddha Ganesh Adhyatma Sanskruti Prabodhan Nyas at Siddha Ganesh Mandir, Laxmi Nagar. Rastogi said, “It is essential to remember Lord Ram always as Ram is the ideal as a son, man, soul mate and lord. Lord Ram has connected the nation from North to South.” Rastogi also said that the main purpose of Lord Ram’s existence was to demonstrate the righteous path for all living creatures on earth. She gave a detailed explanation of Valamiki Ramayan over the course of three days of the lecture series, talking about all the characters such as Ram, Sita, Lakshman, Bharat, Hanuman and Ravan. Rastogi explained how Sita was portrayed as a female of purity and virtue and how Ramayana was an important influence on later Sanskrit and Hindu life and culture. “I attended all the lectures of Rastogi and am happy she explained Valamiki Ramayan beautifully which was not known to everyone,” said a visitor Pratibha Tikle.
