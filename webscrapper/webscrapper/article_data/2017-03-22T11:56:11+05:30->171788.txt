PATNA: State education minister   on Tuesday backed the   government’s decision to do away with beacon lights on the vehicles of ministers and officials. “I would welcome such a step in Bihar. It would actually reduce the gap between common man and ministers,” Choudhary said.
 
  Senior   functionary and former deputy CM   too expressed agreement with the step not to use red beacon lights on vehicles. He, however, said the temptation to flash beacon light is more visible among ruling party members.
  
  Use of beacon light on vehicles by ministers, legislators and bureaucrats is considered as a status symbol and show that the user is a VIP.
  
  Senior JD (U) functionary and deputy leader in state legislative assembly   also spoke in favour of doing away with use of red beacon lights.
  
  “Chief minister Nitish Kumar has already initiated a pioneering step not to use siren during movement of his caravan. Punjab government has now come up against use of beacon lights on vehicles of ministers, legislators and bureaucrats which is appreciative,” Rajak said.
  
  BJP MLAs Nitin Navin and Arun Sinha also echoed similar views.
  
  On March 18, the   government in Punjab had decided to put a ban on the use of beacon lights on vehicles of ministers, MLAs and bureaucrats to end VIP culture in Punjab.
