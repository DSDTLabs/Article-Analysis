NEW DELHI: The ‘pain’ of peak-hour flying at IGI Airport’s Terminal 1 could show signs of reducing from  .

 With talks between low cost carriers and Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) over shifting of some domestic flights from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 reaching an impasse, aviation secretary R N Choubey on Tuesday told TOI that the ministry will find a solution within a week.
 
 “We will take a call on what the solution should be within a week. The ministry will help in the decision-making,” Choubey said. IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir operate all their domestic flights, both arrivals and departures, from T1 and the combined traffic is such that the terminal is handling more passenger traffic that its capacity, leading to severe congestion during peak hours.
 
 DIAL had earlier suggested shifting some flights of all the three low cost carriers (LCC) to T2 or shifting one or two LCCs to T2 completely. While all the airlines are against splitting domestic operations between two terminals, they have not been able to arrive at a consensus with DIAL over who should shift from T1 to T2.
 
 T1 is closer to flyers coming from the city as T2 is next to the Terminal 3. DIAL has made the mothballed-since-2010 Terminal 2 ready for handling domestic flights. But with a consensus eluding on which low cost carrier/s will shift there, it is learnt to have requested the aviation ministry to step in.
 
 The airport operator, which has so far not commented on this issue, needs to decongest T1 not only for reducing passenger woes but also to get space to begin expansion work there so that it can handle 3 crore passenger annually by 2020.
 
 A senior airline official said: “The government must begin work on a second airport for Delhi somewhere in the NCR, otherwise we will be repeating the mistake made in Mumbai where demand far outstrips airport capacity. A big city like Delhi needs multiple airports.”
