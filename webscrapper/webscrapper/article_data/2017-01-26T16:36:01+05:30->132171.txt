CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu chief minister   unfurled the   at Marina on Thursday as Maharashtra governor  , who holds the additional charge of Tamil Nadu, had to participate in the   at Mumbai. It is for the first time in many years that a chief minister of Tamil Nadu hoisted the national flag on Republic Day.

 The event on Kamaraj Salai was, however, remarkable for its low attendance of the general public. This is in sharp contrast to previous years when people throng to witness the spectacular display of decorated floats and cultural programmes organised as part of   celebrations. After unfurling the national flag near Mahathma Gandhi statue, Panneerselvam took the salute of ceremonial march past of army, navy and the air force, besides the state police. It was followed by the procession of floats from 16 state government departments, which prominently featured the portraits of former chief minister J Jayalalithaa and the schemes launched during her tenure.
 
 Interestingly, the tableau of the agriculture department depicted the farmers festival of Pongal with the traditional earthen pot and bull. The same road, a few days ago, witnessed an unprecedented protest seeking to lift the ban on Jallikattu and violence that followed. It resulted in passing of a bill to amend the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 to facilitate the conduct of the rural ancient bull taming sport in the state. Police was deployed across the stretch of Marina with spots like Vivekanandar House, the epicentre of pro-Jallikattu protests, recording significant presence of the men in khaki.
 
 Earlier, the chief minister gave away various awards including the Anna Medal for Gallantry to a nursing student W Durgadevi. She (Durgadevi) jumped into Coovam River to rescue another student after a wooden bridge collapsed at Island Grounds during a marathon event in June last year (2016).
