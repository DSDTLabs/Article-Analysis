KOZHIKODE: The alleged ‘lewd audio clip’ of   shocked Kerala’s political circles as the 71- year-old   had over the years earned the stature of a senior leader in the LDF. He was a popular leader from Malabar. Even during the ministry formation talks last year,   had favoured him over Kuttanad MLA Thomas Chandy, the other MLA in the two-member NCP parliamentary party in the state.

 It was his strong grassroots links and socialist leanings that had endeared him to the CPM leaders during the past three decades. He had been able to increase his majority from Elathur constituency from 14,654 votes in 2011 to 29,057 votes in 2016.
 
 Saseendran, who hails from Elayavoor in Kannur, had forayed into politics through Kerala Students Union (KSU), the student wing of the Congress in 1962. He made his mark in student politics serving alongside then KSU leaders like A K Antony and Vayalar Ravi. He became the Kozhikode district president of KSU in 1965 and became state general secretary in 1967. Saseendran became the state general secretary of the Youth Congress in 1969 and moved on to become its president in 1978.
 
 With the split in state unit Congress, he remained with Antony along with leaders like A C Shanmughadas. However he refused to go back to Congress party when Antony rejoined the Congress in 1982 and stood firmly with the Congress (S) and was state general secretary of the party from 1982 to 1998.Saseendran had served as the state secretary of the NCP from 1999 to 2004. He was the parliamentary party leader of the party from 2006 onwards and is now serving as national working committee member of the party.
 
 He became MLA for the first time from Peringalam constituency in 1980. He was elected from Edakkad constituency in 1982 though he lost from Kannur in 1987. He won from Balussery constituency in 2006 and from Elathur in 2011 and 2016.
 
 Though there were reports that the berth for NCP in the Pinarayi ministry would be equally shared by Saseendran and Kuttanad MLA Thomas Chandy, the party’s state leadership had refuted the claim. He had served as member of the Coffee Board and Housing Board.
