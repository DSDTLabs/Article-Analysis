PUNE: After the Pune Municipal Corporation’s general body (GB) recently approved a proposal to provide   to four villages on behest of  , more villages located close to the city have approached the   demanding water supply.

 Political pressure is building on the   to provide water even as the villages have not paid water bills to the civic body. Bills run into crores of rupees yet villagers haven’t responded to PMC’s appeal to pay dues.
 
 Last week, the GB approved a proposal to provide water tankers to four villages Tilekar insisted on the proposal. Now, villagers from other fringe areas, including Ambegaon, Sus, Pashan and Narhe, have demanded the same. 
 
 However, the administration is against the proposal. The civic body collectively lifts 14 to 16 TMC water from Khadakwasla, Varasgaon, Temghar and Panshet dams. Officials said that the city would require 19 TMC water a year, considering the impending merger of 34 fringe villages in the municipal limits.
 
 “BJP leaders are playing politics using the water issue. They are looking to appease voters in rural areas by providing water tankers. However, taxpaying citizens aren’t getting sufficient water,” said Congress leader Arvind Shinde.
 
 Mayor Mukta Tilak confirmed that the matter would be discussed with the civic administration and a decision on providing water to fringe villages would be taken only after an all-party consultation.
