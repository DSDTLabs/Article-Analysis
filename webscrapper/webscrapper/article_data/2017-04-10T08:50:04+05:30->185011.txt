LUCKNOW:   who holds charge as   minister too,   said on Sunday that roads in the state would now be built with a new technique that uses rubble and brings down the cost of construction by 25%.

 Maurya, was speaking to media persons on completion of one year as UP   chief. Maurya, under whose tenure the   formed government after around 15 years said money would be realised from contractors with whose connivance funds for roads were released and actual work remained only on paper.
 
 He said a probe is on to identify such contractors and officials and added that directives had been issued to blacklist such contractors and firms involved in fleecing public money. To put a curb on corruption, e-tendering process has been started in the PWD, said Maurya, adding that government is considering to hold a cabinet meeting in Allahabad in view of Ardh Kumbh in 2019.
 
 He assured that all roads in the state would be free of potholes by June 15, the deadline set by CM Aditya Nath Yogi. He also said that a committee had been formed to look for ways to help potato farmers after holding discussions with various departments it was decided that state government would purchase potato from farmers at the cost of Rs 487 per quintal. “The state produces banana, amla and mango but for lack of proper packaging units, farmers are unable to export them, so government has decided to set up food packaging units in the state,” said Maurya. 
 
 Similarly, to end the role of middle-men, the government has opened 5,000 wheat purchase centres, where farmers can sell wheat at minimum support prices of Rs 1,625 per quintal along with Rs 10 per quintal for loading and reloading, he said.
