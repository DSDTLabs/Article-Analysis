BENGALURU: The elderly usually settle in their easy chairs with long hours dedicated to reading in the mornings and spend the evenings walking and chit-chatting. It’s time to be at ease. But not for 81-year-old retired Air Vice Marshal Ajit Lamba.

 Lamba is the oldest man to fly at   and a chat with him gives no indication of a time he may want to hang his boots. He has flown over 100 types of planes and has logged about 7,500 hours in his over 60 years of flying career.
 
 Flying the Hansa-3 from the hangars of National Aerospace Laboratories, he will be the ‘youngest’ aviator at Yelahanka Air Force Station. “I’m happy to be flying after having missed out the last couple of editions. I did a few sorties at HAL before landing here. I’m good to go,” Lamba said.
 
 It has been 26 years since Lamba retired from the IAF after having served the country for 36 long years. His connection with Bengaluru has been from his last posting with the Aircraft and Systems Testing Establishment, an elite institute training test pilots and engineers.
 
 “I’ve flown in all the editions 1996 onwards,” said Lamba, who celebrates his birthday in the air every year, literally. In fact, for his 70th birthday, his wife had gifted him a microlight aircraft Pegasus.
 
 “Unfortunately, I had to sell it as there wasn’t enough parking space in Bengaluru,” Lamba said.
