  : Rumours are being heard in the city that police have taken   - a close associate of the   Chhota Shakeel - along with his aides into custody on Sunday. However, police have denied these reports. 

 Sources said that police had apprehended Malabari's associates a while ago, and interrogated them. "Acting on the information they provided, police were able to find the body of Rohan Redekar, son of a city-based industrialist, at Chorla Ghat on Sunday," said sources.
 
 Rohan had been kidnapped on February 18, 2015. Sources further said Malabari's associates had confessed to the crimes, including murder, during interrogation. Reports on TV channels claim that Malabari has been residing in Belagavi since 2014, with the help of a few influential friends. However, deputy commissioner of police (law and order), Belagavi, R Radhika said, "We know about Malabari's Belagavi connections, but there's no truth to these reports that he's staying in the city.'
 
 Police commissioner TG Krishna Bhatta denied the reports. "We've taken a few people into custody for inquiry. But they are not related to the Malabari case," he said.
