Bathinda: After more than seven and a half years, 24 representatives of farmer unions and farm labourers and Left outfits were acquitted on Saturday in the last of the four cases registered against them in Chandigarh for attempt to murder, rioting, obstructing a public servant from discharging official duties and tearing of uniform of police personnel.

 Four cases were registered against 142 persons at two police stations of sectors 17 and 11 in Chandigarh after farmers had clashed with the police at the Parade Ground in Sector 17 on September 6, 2009. Thousands of activists of five farmer and farm labourer outfits had reached the city to oppose the proposed unbundling of the erstwhile Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB). Eightyseven activists were discharged from the cases at various stages.
 
 Four cases were pursued in the courts against 55 persons, of which 31 were acquitted in three cases. The remaining 24 were acquitted from the fourth case on Saturday.
 
 Counsel for farm activists Jarnail Singh said that, “All activists have been acquitted in the case as the prosecution failed to prove any charge against the persons named in the FIR registered on September 6, 2009 at the Sector 11 police station.”
 
 Acquitted persons include Punjab Sabhyachark Manch president Amolak Singh, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) president and general secretary Joginder Singh Ugrahan and Sukhdev Singh Kokri, respectively, BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) vice-president Jhanda Singh, Kisan Sangharsh Committee president Satnam Singh Pannu, Prem Singh Bhangu of Kisan Sabha Punjab, Punjab Khet Mazdoor Union (PKMU) president Jora Singh Nasrali and PKMU general secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala.
 
 After their acquittal, Amolak and Kokri told TOI, “The police had mercilessly beaten up activists when we decided to oppose the proposed unbundling of PSEB and false cases were slapped on us.”
