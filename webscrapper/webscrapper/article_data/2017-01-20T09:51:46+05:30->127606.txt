JAIPUR: When   won the   for his work ‘The Sellout’, it was the first time that an American had won the award. Until 2014, Americans were not considered for the Man Booker.

 At the session on his book at Jaipur Lit Fest on Thursday, this satirist was asked his views on political correctness. Beatty was frank: “I don't know what political correctness is, what   is. Maybe I knew for about a week.”
 
 He recalled how students he taught -- from diverse backgrounds -- were in tears the day after the results of US presidential polls were announced. “It did not hit me like that,” he said of Donald Trump's victory.
 
 Beatty's Sellout has been hailed as political satire at its best -- it recounts the story of a boy raised by a single parent, a controversial sociologist father who is murdered, leaving the son to try some absolutely fantastical ways to set things right -- including re-introducing slavery!
 
 At the JLF session too, Beatty spoke with easy informality about politically sensitive and controversial matters, comparing the Trump victory to what he termed “dick pics” -- men uploading on social media pictures of their private parts. “While some people are repelled and look the other way, some take it in their stride,” he said.
