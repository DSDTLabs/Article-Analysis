CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister   on Monday shifted four top cops while giving two of them key departments. Batchmates of 1987 IPS ADGPs   and Rohit Choudhary were given top departments of administration and law and order, respectively.

 Amarinderâ€™s selection of Sahota and Choudhary is being seen as an indication of assertion that it is still the chief minister who will call the shots in the police department. The latest move came barely a week after the CM inducted ADGP   to head the new commando unit as well as special operations group (SOG), keeping DGP Suresh Arora out of picture.
 
 Sahota too was sent out by Arora from key post of bureau of investigation (BoI) to internal vigilance last week. Arora had last year decided to divide areas of BoI work until Sahota sent a letter, saying that the decision was unnecessary and would violate the Punjab and Haryana high court order. Choudhary too had sent a missive to Arora in January, 2016, pointing out lapses in handling the Pathankot terror attack.
 
 With this new posting, Choudhary, an engineer from IIT and a management graduate, also makes a comeback to law and order wing, which he headed during Dinanagar terror attack probe before Arora shunted him out in November 2015. Incumbent DGP (law and order) and 1985-batch IPS Hardeep Dhillon has been sent to internal vigilance. Both Dhillon and Choudhary had played a key role in managing   operations in Gurdaspur terror attack and the probe afterwards. Incumbent 1992-batch IPS ADGP (administration)   will now head jails department.
 
 Arora had recently given top jobs to 1987-batch IPS Dinkar Gupta, 1988-batch IPS Prabodh Kumar, 1991-batch IPS B K Uppal and 1994-batch IPS Praveen Sinha at intelligence, BoI, vigilance bureau and Jalandhar commissionerate, respectively. Sources in the Congress and home department said Amarinder might replace Gupta due to his perceived proximity with Arora.
