Colva: Additional director general of shipping Amitabh Kumar on Thursday assured members of the Goan Seamen Association of India (GSAI) that he will try to find a solution to the seafarersâ€™ issue of being prevented from travelling abroad for employment on cruise liners, since some seamen had not cleared their SSC examinations. 

 Passing SSC exams is necessary for those applying for the continuous discharge certificate (CDC), which is required for work purposes in the shipping line.
 
 An Indian national of 18 years, holding an Indian passport and a class 10 pass certificate, has to complete the recommended safety courses which entitles him to apply for a CDC. 
 
 GSAI spokesman Dixon Vaz told Kumar that with the enforcement of this clause, Goans working on cruise liners for several years were being turned back from the airport by immigration personnel for not having the CDC.
