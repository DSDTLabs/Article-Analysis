TRICHY: Palakkarai police on Tuesday arrested 58-year-old S Vijayasekar on charges of murdering his wife and inflicting serious injuries on his pregnant daughter by setting fire to them at the bakery run by him on Sunday night. He had committed the crime due to a domestic dispute over the love affair of his unmarried daughter with a policeman, police said.

 The case of the mysterious fire accident where V  , 54 died took a twist with police pointing suspicions on Vijayasekar on Monday. The accused was also booked for attempting to murder his daughter V Swathi, 27, who was seven month pregnant.
 
 Police said that  , 29, from  , a police constable in Tamil Nadu special police battalion was in love with Swathi. Though both belonged to the same community, they secretly married in September 2017 due to hostility from Vijayasekar. However, they lived with their respective parents.
 
 In this scenario, Swathi got pregnant in the relationship with her husband Thangavelu. He wanted her to live with him at his house. It is said that her mother Mallika also accepted this and was about to send her to Thangaveluâ€™s home. But, this was not accepted by Vijayasekar.
 
 Hence, he allegedly planned to kill his wife and daughter by pouring petrol on them in his bakery and executed his plan. He then enacted a drama that it was a fire accident. The neighbours came to their rescue and rushed them to Mahatma Gandhi memorial government hospital (MGMGH) where Mallika died on Monday morning. Swathi is undergoing treatment in the critical care unit.
 
 Based on a complaint lodged by Thangavelu, who expressed his suspicions over the fire incident, police conducted an investigation and arrested Vijayasekar. He was remanded to judicial custody on Tuesday evening.
