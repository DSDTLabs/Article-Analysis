NEW DELHI: There is a sense of unease within the   that if an eminent person over the age of 70 is picked in the interim panel to oversee the implementation of reforms in the Indian cricket administation, it would not adhere to the age cap of 70 years as mandated by the panel and the Supreme Court. Of course, this would only be an interim arrangement, but the old guard that is being pushed into exile could well cry about double standards.

 If  , amicus curiae of the   case, and senior advocate   pick the administrators by ignoring norms like 70 years age cap, government servants etc it may directly oppose the Lodha committee's reforms. “Though it's an interim arrangement, the administrator should be picked in accordance with the Lodha's reforms. The basic crux of the norms can't be changed,“ a BCCI source said.
 
 Sources close to the panel even suggested that the two senior lawyers didn't even consult the panel about the administrators. When TOI spoke to Divan, he declined to comment on the issue. “I can't make any comment on this,“ he said while adding that he would strictly go by the book.
 
 The Lodha panel, however, doesn't seem to be taking offence by the snub. They made it clear that the Lodha Panel didn't want to get involved with the appointment of administrators. “It's come down to a position where the Lodha Committee just wants to ensure that the norms of BCCI administrators as mentioned in the reforms are not ignored while appointing the committee of administrators,“ the source added.
