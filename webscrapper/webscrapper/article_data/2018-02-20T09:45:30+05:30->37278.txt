HYDERABAD: Jana Sena Party (JSP) leader   on Monday threw a counter-challenge at YSR Congress Party leader Y S   to immediately move a no-confidence motion against the government at the Centre and said he would help him get the required numbers to get the motion passed. 

 At a public meeting in Kandukur of Prakasam district on Sunday, Jagan had challenged both Pawan Kalyan and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) to support a no-confidence motion as they too are in favour of getting special category status for AP. 
 
 At a media conference in Hyderabad, Pawan accepted the challenge. "It will be my responsibility to get the numbers to back the no-confidence motion. He should go ahead with it immediately. I'm also seeking no credit," he said. 
 
 Pawan also said that if Jagan fails to move the motion, the TDP should move it. "I will ask for the support of the Left parties and also go to Karnataka to get support. Rahul Gandhi has also favoured special status for AP, so he should also support it," Pawan said. 
 
 Pawan also hoped that the TRS would support the no-confidence motion as Nizamabad MP Kavitha had spoken in favour of Andhra Pradesh getting the special category status in Parliament recently.
