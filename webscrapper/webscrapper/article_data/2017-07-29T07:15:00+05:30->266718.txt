GURUGRAM: A pack of  , with little ones clinging on to their backs, jumped into a balcony in  . Finding the door open, the pack storms its way in and runs amok. After a while, house owners hear noises and rush to the upper storey.

 This has become a common occurrence in South City -1, whose simian problem refuses to go away despite a series of   to catch the monkeys and free them in forest areas. 
 
 “They come back after a while. I fear they will soon outnumber us,” said Simran Dixit, a resident of Block A, whose 51-inch television was pulled off the wall by monkeys a few months ago. Her domestic help, too, lost her phone to the monkeys. Earlier this year, the monkeys allegedly strangled a peacock that she cared for to death. 
 
 Aakanksha Singh, another resident, had to grapple with a serious situation a few months ago when her 5-year-old autistic daughter was attacked by monkeys. 
 
 Aryan Choudhary, who works with Wildlife Care India – the NGO tasked with flushing out monkeys from   city — said they have conducted multiple drives in South City-1.
 
 M D Sihna, conservator (forests) Gurgaon circle, underscored the futility of catching and releasing monkeys. “There is no point of releasing them elsewhere, they come back,” he said. “In Delhi, they have found ways to deal with this problem. For example, in Asola Bhatti sanctuary, they ensure availability of food for monkeys with the help of NGOs to distract them from going into the city. We ought to do something similar in Gurgaon.”
