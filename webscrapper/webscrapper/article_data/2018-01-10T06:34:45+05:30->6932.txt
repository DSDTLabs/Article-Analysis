PANAJI: Goa’s government schools have the most number of teachers over 55 years of age in the country. With 16.4% of the government school teachers in Goa above the age of 55 years, the state’s figure is more than double the national average that stands at 7.4%, as per the latest date of the Union human resource development ministry’s department of school education and literacy (DISE).

 “Following Goa’s liberation (in 1961), mainly government schools were established and most of these teachers nearing retirement were recruited by the state in the decade following liberation. Privately managed schools in Goa came much later on the scene, in the 80s or so,” said director of education  . “This is the reason teachers in Goa’s government schools employed then are now nearing retirement.”
 
 
 
 
 Sources said most of these ageing teachers are working in the government primary schools and an estimated 150 to 200 are set to retire in 2020.
 
 “Under normal circumstances, it is good to have senior and experienced teachers. But in case of Goa, in the decade following 1961, most teachers employed came from   and  . The qualifications they held was a certification called PTC, completed after their high school education. It was only a oneyear course. They were later asked to upgrade themselves. But they may not be the updated with the latest developments in the field that have taken place over all these years,” said a source.
 
 K T Kavlekar, a government primary school headmaster, said the appointment of teachers to these posts has not taken place as the retirements happened, which has caused an imbalance of larger percentage of ageing teachers.
 
 State government says that there are over 450 vacancies for teachers in government schools in Goa.
