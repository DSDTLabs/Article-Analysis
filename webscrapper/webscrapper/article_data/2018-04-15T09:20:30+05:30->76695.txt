LUCKNOW: The BJP targeted   chief   Yadav over the unveiling of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar’s statue by him as politically motivated and asked the former CM if he would also tells SP goons to return the land of Dalits that they had forcibly taken over.

 BJP state president Mahendra Nath Pandey said that SP chief’s decision to celebrate Ambedkar Jayanti was only because of his ‘newfound bonhomie’ with arch rival BSP.
 
 “Akhilesh also needs to tell if he would apologise for tearing the reservation in promotion bill, which   has always been pushing for,” said Pandey, speaking at a function to mark Ambedkar Jayanti on Saturday. Pandey went on to ask Akhilesh if he would promise that his party workers would stop desecrating statues of Ambedkar when the ‘alliance’ with BSP breaks. The BSP, meanwhile, organised a function at Dr   Samajik Parivartan Prateek Sthal in Gomtinagar to pay homage to the Dalit icon. BSP national general secretary Satish Chandra Mishra lit the candle in the absence of party chief Mayawati who was in Delhi. Several former ministers, MLAs, party nominee for MLC elections,  , party leaders and supporters paid floral tributes to Ambedkar and recited ‘Buddha Vandana’.
 
 SC Mishra experessed surprise on reports of BJP celebrating Ambedkar Jayanti, and said, “Achchha hai agar woh log bhi mana rahe hain...”   also organised a function at party headquarters in Lucknow. Party’s SC/ST Morcha vice-president Siddhishri accused BJP of creating divisions within the society and attempting to do away with reservation for Dalits.
