PUNE: Housing societies are unhappy with local bodies for allegedly not paying heed to a circular of the cooperative department. 

 The circular enables citizens to approach the local bodies for authorisation letters for society registration with the cooperative department.
 
 Societies in the city and   area, which are aware of the circular and want to approach the local bodies, are allegedly not being attended to. Civic officials, however, pleaded ignorance of the circular.
 
 Pune city and PCMC in total have 16,000 registered housing societies. The cooperative department has through the circular, issued around a month ago, urged more societies to get registered with it even if they do not have their occupation certificates and commencement of construction and completion certificates. But for this, the societies needed approval from local bodies stating that their buildings were authorised.
 
 Advocate Radhikesh Uttarwar, who represented some societies in  , said the circular was “a good initiative” but “highly ineffective” without the support of the local bodies like the   (PMC) and the  . “Getting the no objection certificates are virtually impossible in reality,’’ he said. 
 
 PMC officials said they will check for the rules as usually the builder has to take permissions. PCMC commissioner Dinesh Waghmare told TOI that he will ask his staffers to cooperate after checking for the circular.
 
 A cooperative department official said in Pune itself, there are over a lakh housing societies and more in PCMC but very few are registered. “The initiative was to get them registered. However, with the civic authorities not cooperating, not a single society has been registered with us after the circular was issued,” the official added.
