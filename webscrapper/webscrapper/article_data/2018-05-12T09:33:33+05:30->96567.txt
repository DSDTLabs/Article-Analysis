Most of the time I have been travelling during elections due to my cricket commitments and casting my vote has been a challenge. That said, whenever possible I have ensured I have cast my ballot. The last time I voted was during the BBMP elections. This time around I have cancelled all my plans for the day to ensure I am there to cast my vote in the state elections. It is important to elect your representative and give them an opportunity to work. Remember, voting is your right.

 The percentage of people who vote, especially in the urban areas, is relatively low. I urge people not to treat the occasion as a weekend holiday. Instead, use it as an opportunity to exercise your right. Even if your choice is NOTA (None
 
 of the above), use it because often when you don’t cast your vote it gets misused. Even NOTA is good, because it is a choice that you have made.
 
 I would advise first-time voters not to let go of the opportunity to exercise your right. It is a feeling of empowerment which you should experience. Remember the youth of today are the future of tomorrow. You will have a voice — a powerful one — and you should ensure it is heard. If you want to see change, it must start with you today with your participation in the elections. Every vote counts and every vote makes a big difference.
 
 We are three voters at home (wife Chethana and daughter Aaruni) and we will be there at our polling station to exercise our choice.
 
 I hope people across   turn out in maximum numbers because it is OUR right to vote.
