NEW DELHI: In what is turning out to be a jinxed   season already,  's   is now down with chicken pox. The swashbuckling Mumbai batsman fell ill during the fourth Test against Australia in Dharamshala last week. 

 "He was feeling unwell during the Test and then it seemed like he caught viral fever. But after returning to Mumbai, he was down with chicken pox," a Daredevils source told TOI. "He's likely to join in another 10 days," the source added.
 
 Daredevils are already crippled with JP Duminy and Quinton de Kick pulling out of the IPL. While Duminy cited personal reasons, de Kick is nursing an injured index finger. There is also uncertainty surrounding Angelo Mathews who is yet to recover from his calf injury. The Sri Lankan captain will not be playing in the T20I series against Bangladesh and has expressed his strong desire to be fit for the Champions Trophy in June. 
 
 However, the Daredevils management is hoping that the star all-rounder will be back for the later half of the tournament.
