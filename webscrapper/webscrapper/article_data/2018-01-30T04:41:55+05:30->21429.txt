CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and   high court on Monday stayed the election to the posts of president and vice-president of   municipal council (MC) in Jind district. The elections were to be held on Monday at 11am.

 A division bench headed by Justice   passed these orders while hearing an application filed by Suresh Kumar, a councillor from Narwana MC, challenging the notice issued by the district revenue officer (DRO) for holding a meeting on January 29 to elect president and vice-president of the civic body. According to the applicant, the process to elect the president and vice-president of the Narwana MC had already been challenged before the Punjab and Haryana high court. Despite that the Jind DC under extraneous reasons/considerations ordered the holding of a meeting to elect office-bearers.
 
 The petitioner also argued that the notice for the meeting was intentionally served on January 25 by the Jind DRO on the instructions of the DC just to avoid any legal order as the high court was closed from January 26 to 28. It was also submitted that the petitioner had earlier filed a petition, alleging interference in the process of no-confidence motion against the earlier elected body by the district administration.
 
 “The HC had ordered the state to seal records but despite this, the Jind DC is acting in an illegal and malafide manner. Issuance of orders by the DC to the DRO for holding a meeting to hold elections is interference in the process of law. If the election is not stayed, I will suffer irreparable loss,” argued the applicant. Hearing the plea, the HC stayed the election and asked the authorities to file a reply on the issue on Tuesday.
