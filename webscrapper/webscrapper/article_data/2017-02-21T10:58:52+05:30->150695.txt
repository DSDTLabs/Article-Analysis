PATNA: Gyan Bhavan, the first component of Samrat Ashok International Convention Centre (SAICC) being constructed near  , is likely to be ready before Bihar Diwas celebrations beginning March 22.

 In a review meeting of the building construction department on February 1, its principal secretary   directed the engineers concerned to complete the Gyan Bhavan for its inauguration on March 22 on the occasion of Bihar Divas, which could be celebrated smoothly. Earlier, April 18 was fixed for its inauguration with an international seminar. 
 
 Gyan Bhavan is a double-storey structure with an exhibition hall on the ground floor to accommodate 2,000 people. The conference hall on the first floor can accommodate around 800 people. Chief minister   intends to start the yearlong Champaran centenary celebrations with an international seminar at Gyan Bhavan on April 18.
 
 The SAICC project is already delayed by more than a year. It was scheduled to be completed by November, 2015. The project was conceptualized in 2012 during the Global Bihar Summit, when the need of a big convention centre was felt as   had the capacity to accommodate only 1500 people.
 
 Located on the north-western corner of Gandhi Maidan, the SAICC is being constructed in over 11.82 acre. It will have a main convention hall, Gyan Bhavan auditorium, Sabhyata Dwar and a food court. The complex is divided in two parts connected with a subway.
 
 The main convention hall is a four-storey structure with a height of 35 metres. Around 21,600 metric tonnes of steel are being used in its construction. It is proposed to be an iconic earthquake-resistant building with a parking lot for 450 vehicles in its basement.
