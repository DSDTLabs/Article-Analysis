BHOPAL: A bet led to a drag race between a Bhopali modified jeep and an SUV, ending in a horrifying accident at 120kmph on Bhopal’s VIP Road at 4.30am on Monday. Whoever lost would have had to give away his vehicle to the other. Seeing the ‘jugadu’ jeep pulling ahead, the SUV driver — 30-year-old Sachin Hiwale — sped up, but hit a divider in Koh-e-Fiza and lost his life.

 
 The SUV flipped over thrice before coming to a stop upside down. Three of Sachin’s friends, who were in the SUV, could get out but he was pinned under the steering wheel and died within minutes of being taken to hospital. Police are looking for the driver of the jeep but are yet to identify him.
 
 Sachin, whose Facebook page is full of pictures of his foreign vacations, owned a tourism business in Ghana and was due to board a flight to Mumbai a couple of hours later from where he would have flown to  . But fate took him to a tea stall in the pre-dawn hours, where he bumped into a group that shared his passion for fast cars and bikes.
 
 Sachin was a resident of 272-Priyadarshini Nagar near Narmada Bhawan. According to police, Sachin’s friend   aka  , a resident of  , invited him to the birthday party of his nephew Ayush at a dhaba on Raisen Road on Sunday. Sachin and his brother-in-law Babban Mathur reached the party venue at 11pm. After partying a while, Sachin, Nitesh and two other friends decided to go on a long drive.
 
 Midway through their pre-dawn joyride, they had the urge for tea. Nitesh said that they drove to a tea kiosk near Kamla Park around 4am. When they were having tea, Sachin spotted a modified ‘Bhopali jeep’ parked nearby. He went over and spoke to the four strangers lounging on the jeep and sipping tea.
