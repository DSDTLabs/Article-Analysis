CHANDIGARH: Looking to tackle the problem of large-scale unemployment in  , the state government has mooted a proposal to cap the   of all state government employees at 58. There are 3.18 lakh jobless in Punjab. The decision, if implemented, will impact 6,500 employees in the 58-60 age group in the state this year. 

 The proposal comes close on the heels of the government roping in location-based taxi operator Uber to generate jobs through its   last week.
 
 The population of Punjab was 27,70 million, according to the 2011 Census. The decision will create immediate job opportunities across four key departments of education, power, health and police, which frequently receive flak over red-tapism and botched-up performance, including poor results in state schools, high drop-out rates, power thefts, failure of state schemes pertaining to cancer and drug rehabilitation as well as deteriorating law and order.
