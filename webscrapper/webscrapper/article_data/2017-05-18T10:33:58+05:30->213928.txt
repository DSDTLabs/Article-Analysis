LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other in the northern region, known as consuming states, are likely to benefit as compared to manufacturing states like   and   under the Goods and   (GST) regime, said chief commissioner of customs and excise Sheo Narayan Singh. 

 Part of the two-member high-level committee formed by chief minister   for the implementation of the GST in the state, Singh also claimed that the new tax regime was a classic case of deliberative democracy and cooperative federalism as it would benefit both the Centre and the states without hurting anyone's interests.
 
 Talking to TOI after inaugurating the GST building in Gomatinagar, Singh said that once the GST will be implemented from July I, other taxes like customs excise taxes, trade, commercial and the service tax would be merged with it. "It would be true unification, with only one tax throughout the length and breadth of this vast and diverse nation," he said.
