NEW DELHI: Observing the crime to be “highly derogatory”, a 48-year-old man was awarded 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment by a Delhi court for raping a minor girl three years ago. 

 Accused Satnam Singh lived in the same building as the minor. In April 2014, when the girl, then six-years-old, had gone to use the washroom on the third floor, the accused sexually assaulted her. 
 
 The prosecution, to prove its case, examined 23 witnesses including the survivor. She supported the prosecution’s case and there was no cross examination to disbelieve her testimony, the court noted.
 
 The accused, through his counsel, said that it was a false case, which was registered with the help of an NGO. It argued that Singh never committed a penetrative nor any physical assault. The defense counsel added that there was a considerable delay in the registration of an FIR in order to concoct a false story.
 
 The additional public prosecutor, on the contrary, argued that there was no contradiction or improvement in victim’s testimony and her parents. It said that all charges against the accused were beyond reasonable doubt. The court noted that there was neither improvement nor any discrepancy in the victim’s statement. “The age of the victim cannot be ignored as she was a child of only six years,” observed the court.
 
 The testimony, therefore, was enough for the prosecution to prove the offences under Section 5(m) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, punishable under Section 6 of the same Act.
 
 When it came to arguing for the punishment, the prosecution asserted that Singh did not deserve any leniency and sought maximum sentencing, so that it acts as a deterrent for other impending offenders.
 
 Awarding the sentence, the court held, “The convict had committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon a girl child aged only about six years.” Besides, it directed   to compensate the victim with Rs 10,000.
