AHMEDABAD: Merely 15km from the state capital,  , a   youth was beaten up by some upper caste people allegedly for sporting a moustache! 

 Three persons from the darbar community allegedly abused and assaulted   (24), the youth from Limbodara village in Kalol taluka of Gandhinagar district, on September 25 because the members from the dominant community did not like the idea of a dalit youth sporting a moustache.
 
  Police lodged a complaint under the atrocities act against the trio from the same village, identified as Mayursinh Vaghela, Rahul Vikramsinh Serathia and Ajitsinh Vaghela, on September 26. The case is being probed by a DySP level officer. 
 
 According to the FIR, Parmar, who works with a private firm in Gandhinagar, and his cousin Digant Maheria were returning to their home after enjoying garba at their village when some people started hurling casteist abuses at them. 
 
 “As it was dark, we could not see them. When we went near the place from where the voice was coming, we found three members of the darbar community there. Just to avoid any scuffle, we ignored them. As we reached our house, the darbars came to our house and started abusing us again. They first assaulted my cousin Digant and then started beating me, repeatedly asking me how can you sport a moustache despite coming from a lower caste community,” Parmar told TOI.
 
 An FIR has been registered in this connection by the Kalol police under IPC sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with an intent to provoke breach of peace), and 114 (abetment), besides the atrocities act.
 
 The FIR reads, “The accused in the case have committed the offence of abusing, beating and asking the complainant how can he sport a moustache.”
