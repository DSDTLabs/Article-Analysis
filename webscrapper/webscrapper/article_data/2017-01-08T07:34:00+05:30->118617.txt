JALANDHAR: Two days after his vote from   was cancelled, former Congress minster   held a show of strength at the sprawling workshop of his transport company and conveyed to the high command that the ticket should be given to his son Bawa Henry “as is the voice of the people”.

 His son has already applied for the ticket. People attending the rally included several sitting and former Congress councilors, scores of party workers, and other supporters of Henry. Pointing to the good turnout, assembled at the venue, he asked the party to hear the voice of the people. “There is no doubt over the Congress workers of the constituency want,” he said.
 
 Without taking any names, Henry took on an “outsider Congress leader”. He said the leader was a plant of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), but was not staking claim to the ticket from the seat. “Earlier also, he damaged the Congress. His role favoured SAD. Now also, he is part of the same plan,” he said.
 
 Talking about the cancellation of his vote from Jalandhar North, Avtar said he was not bothered about it and it was the handiwork of his rivals. “When I would call up officers in the past five years, they would say they were under immense pressure. I also want to request the officer who struck off my name from electoral roll that governments don’t always remain the same. You should have thought about it. You register my vote and then you struck off my name,” he said. He said the person who recommended the cancellation of his vote was the cousin of a black mailer. “But when Henry would get a chance, you know what will happen,” he added.
