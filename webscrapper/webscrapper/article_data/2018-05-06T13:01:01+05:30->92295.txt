AHMEDABAD:   drivers had been on   for the past four days since Wednesday protesting against incentive cuts by the cab companies –   and  . 

 However, after negotiations with the cab companies on Saturday evening, Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar Radio Cab Owners’ Association (AGRCO), decided to call off their strike. 
 
 Some 5,000 cabs were off the road over the past four days, thus leaving commuters bearing the brunt of higher wait-time and increased fares. 
 
 “I ended up waiting for an average 40 minutes to be able to book a cab from my workplace to home, switching between two to three trip bookings on Friday night. The driver just doesn’t show up!” said Kanu Raval, a citizen, who shared the travails like thousands of other radio cab commuters. 
 
 “Whatever the issue may be between the company and the drivers, the customer is the one to suffer. Besides, due to higher demand, prices have gone up and I end up shelling out more than the normal fare,” he added.
