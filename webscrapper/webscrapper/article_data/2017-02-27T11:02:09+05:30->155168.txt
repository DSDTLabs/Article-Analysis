MUMBAI: Onion prices in the state have touched a five year low. The average price farmers have fetched for a quintal has been Rs 450.

 At the  , the biggest market yard for onions in the country, the average price for a quintal has been Rs 740 in February 2016, when the state was reeling under a severe drought. Cost of production for a quintal is Rs 950. Prices were the highest in 2013, with farmers fetching Rs 1,424 a quintal.
 
 Officials said the dip in price is due to bumper production in the state. Lack of storage and processing infrastructure to increase the shelf life of the produce has left farmers at the mercy of traders, who are consistently quoting low prices. Some farmers have set their onions on fire, as they were not even getting the basic input cost.
 
 Lasalgaon was getting 30,000-35,000 quintals of red onions every day in February, as against the average 12,000. The bumper production resulted in traders demanding more railway wagons to transport onions to other parts of the state and country .
 
 “The shelf life of onions is a month; there is so much stock at the market yard, which will take 20 days to clear if we get adequate transport and the stock keeps increasing every day ,“ said a market committee official.They want 40 wagons to transport onions, but they are getting 15-18 wagons.
 
 The railways agreed to give more wagons to transport the onions, but this being the peak of the harvest, the inflow of produce is not slowing down. Officials hope that in March the produce will slow down and prices will stablise, giving relief to the farmers, who have made an accumulated loss of Rs 200 crore.
 
 Initially, prices were affected due to demonetisation, and they did not pick up till the December-end; since January , heavy inflow and skewed demand and supply ratio led to the dip in price.
