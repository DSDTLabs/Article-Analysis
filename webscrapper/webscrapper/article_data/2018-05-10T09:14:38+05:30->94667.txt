KOCHI: A   high court judge recently had an unusual task at hand, that of picking a name for a five-year-old boy after his parents, belonging to different faiths, fought over the issue in court. The father, a Hindu, wanted to name the child “Abhinav Sachin” while the mother, a Christian, insisted on “Johan Mani Sachin”. Justice A K Jayasankaran Nambiar finally ordered a birth certificate in the name of “Johan Sachin” for the boy.

 The couple, who are in the middle of divorce proceedings, had filed separate petitions before the court, challenging the demand of Kottayam municipality for a court order to issue a birth certificate. They had married as per Christian rites on August 29, 2010 and had a Hindu ceremony the next day. They have two children, with the second one being born in 2013. Subsequently, they approached the family court for divorce. A birth certificate became necessary for the second child for school admission.
 
 The mother cited the baptism certificate for her choice of name but the father argued that “Abhinav Sachin” was the name agreed upon on the 28th day ceremony.
 
 “…it would be in the interest of justice to accede to the wishes of both the parents to the extent possible and, therefore, assign the name ‘Johan Sachin’ to the second child of the petitioners. The name ‘Johan’ would represent the wishes of the mother of the child and the name ‘Sachin’ as a surname would satisfy the requirement of the father (whose first name is Sachin)… This course of action would be in the interests of the minor child,” the judgment said.
