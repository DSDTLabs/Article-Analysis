AMARAVATI: Bucking the trend of low growth rates elsewhere in the country, the 'sunrise' state of Andhra Pradesh has earned a tax revenue of 46,280 crore in the just-ended financial year 2016-17, recording a growth of 9.8 per cent compared to last fiscal's 42,148 crore. 

 Experts point out that generation of this huge revenue through tax collections is not only healthy, but also historic. Interestingly, the government has managed to rake in massive revenues despite some of the targeted sectors not picking up the pace. 
 
 In fact, the near double-digit growth in tax revenues is believed to be the highest for any state in the country. The soaring tax revenues have virtually allayed the fears of adverse impact of demonetisation.
 
 Highly-placed sources told TOI the government had almost readied the financial performance data and is expected to make it public along with the last quarter's performance in the upcoming district collectors' conference here. 
 
 Chief minister   had set in motion of declaring the state's quarterly   on the lines of listed   to provide transparency in governance as well as to keep officials on their toes to reach the targets.
 
 "AP's growth rate and revenues are a reflection of the faith of the industry in the leadership of CM Naidu. The CM is solely responsible for steering clear of apprehensions to achieve the tremendous results," chief secretary   told TOI. 
 
 He said the CM's ability to handle crisis situations has put AP far ahead of others in all sectors.
