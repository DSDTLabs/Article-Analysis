NEW DELHI: Delhi government launched panic alarm buttons in five buses as a pilot project on the eve of International Women’s Day. The government plans to have panic buttons in all public transport buses by March 2019.

 “Panic alarms in buses will add the third line of defence to ensure safety of women in Delhi buses. Our government has already deployed   marshals in all   buses, and implemented CCTVs in 200 DTC buses on a pilot basis,” said transport minister Kailash Gahlot. “By March 2019, we will be scaling up these initiatives to cover all DTC and cluster buses to guarantee a safe and harassment-free bus ride for women,” he said.
 
 The alarms have been put in five cluster buses plying on the route 522. The project has been implemented in collaboration with a Bangalore-based NGO, Project Durga, working in the area of women safety and gender equity in public spaces in the country.
 
 On-board announcements and LED display boards will publicise that the bus is equipped with a panic alarm system. Four panic buttons have been installed to cover the entire length of the vehicle. If any of the alarms is pressed, a loud beeping alarm will be activated for 40 seconds, which then cannot be deactivated. Upon hearing the alarm, the driver will take the bus to the left-most part of the road and bring it to stop. The conductor will be able to see exactly which alarm was pressed, and intervene in the situation. If the situation isn’t minor and cannot be addressed on the spot, the conductor will immediately call the depot manager, who will intimate PCR van if necessary.
 
 The panic alarm system will also be integrated with the bus GPS location, to immediately alert the depot manager and central command centre of   operations at DIMTS Kashmere gate.
