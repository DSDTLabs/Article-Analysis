 is a happy man. His film   featuring   and   in the two pivotal roles recently won   - Best Indian Cinema award at the 10th Bengaluru International Film Festival. The final competition was among fourteen Indian films of 2017 which included Clint (Malayalam) by Harikumar, Evening Shadows (Hindi) by Sridhar Rangayan, Pimpal (Marathi) by Gajendra Ahire, Ishu (Assamese) by Utpal Borpujari, To Let(Tamil) by Chezhiyan Ra and others. The Jury Board of Chitra Bharathi was headed by Claire Dobbin and Manu Chakravarthy . “The citation for Mayurakshi reads - For imaging the metaphysical journeys individuals make at various levels. The film is a profound interrogation of superficial distinctions made between rational and irrational states of mind. And the award was presented by Hon’ble Governor of Karnataka Sri Vajubhai Rudabhai Bala in the presence of Hon’ble Chief Minister of Karnataka, Shri Siddharamaiah and noted filmmaker, Shri Mani Ratnam. So it was very encouraging for me as Mayurakshi was just a regional film and with this award it moved a step forward as it got national recognition,” said the proud director. Mayurakshi also won four Jio Filmfare Awards East 2017 recently including Best Film(Critics), Best Actor(both Popular & Critics) and Best Background Score.
