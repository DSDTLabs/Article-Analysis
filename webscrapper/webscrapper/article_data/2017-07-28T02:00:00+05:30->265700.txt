PATNA: RJD supremo Lalu Prasad’s son and former deputy CM   on Thursday said though JD (U) had been asking for his explanation on the CBI’s FIR against him, CM Nitish Kumar had made up his mind to break the Grand Alliance, explanation or no explanation.

 “I met Nitish-ji after a cabinet meeting on July 18. I asked him to whom shall I give explanation. I even told him to draft the wording, which I would read out in the people’s court. He didn’t say anything,” Tejashwi told newsmen while coming out of the Raj Bhawan around 2.30am after Wednesday midnight.
 
 “Tejashwi toh ek bahana tha, inko toh BJP ke paas jaana tha (Tejashwi was an alibi, Nitish had to return to BJP),” he added.
 
 The 29-year-old RJD MLA had gone to the governor to stake claim to form government and allow the RJD-Congress combine to prove its majority on the floor of House. The governor is learned to have told Tejashwi that he had already invited Nitish to form government as he had majority.
 
 The former deputy CM also assailed Nitish for his “double standards”. “Nitish-ji now says he was expecting me to quit because my name figured in an FIR. His name also figures in a case of murder and Arms Act violation in Barh. Woh kis munh se shapath lenge?” he asked.
 
 Tejashwi alleged Nitish was behind the recent CBI and Income Tax raids against his family. “It was a conspiracy, which started with Sharad Yadav’s removal from the post of JD (U) president,” he said. 
 
 He said he was taking legal opinion on the CBI FIR. “My lawyers have told me the FIR has many weak points. They also told me to avoid giving point-wise explanation in public domain as it migh prompt them (CBI) to make a stronger case,” he said.
