AHMEDABAD: Indian Railways has decided to extend the Ahmedabad-Mumbai Duronto train, to Rajkot. This train is expected to make its maiden run from Rajkot on May 27.

 Mandaviya’s letter confirmed the decision and officials are working out the timing and other modalities. Officials said the train will likely have ticket quotas for Rajkot and Ahmedabad. Officials said the train will leave Ahmedabad at the same time as it currently does, midnight. A senior officer said it was decided that the train reaching Ahmedabad on morning of the 27th will head to Rajkot, where it will leave in the opposite direction in the evening. Officials said that this the first Duronto train to make a halt. 
 
 Duronto trains were earlier not supposed to make any halts. Since January 2016, it was possible to book tickets for and from stations where the train would make technical stops.
 
 Officials said the extension will mean fewer seats for   as the train is almost 100% full even on working days. Officials said this train is popular with businessman and executives travelling to Mumbai and vice versa.Officials said the train has 17 coaches including six AC 3-tier economy coaches, five AC 3-tier coaches, three AC 2-tier coaches, one AC first class and two EOG cars. tnn
