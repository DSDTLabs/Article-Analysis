 P Malhotra, producer of  , a new TV show on  , shares interesting information about the lead cast. He says, “When Woh Apna Sa’s casting was going on, I remember I was at the gym working out. I met  , who kept telling me that we need to do something good together. At that time, the character of Aditya was created, and I told him that the character is one of the most challenging characters. Also, lead actors on TV don't get a lot to do. But in Woh Apna Sa, this hero is there on both sides of coin. So I explained him the entire graph of the character.”
About casting the female lead, Siddharth says, “I remember speaking to Disha in Bangkok and telling her about the role, and trying to explain to her that this was one of the best written roles. I told her, it wasn’t a regular role and how it was written so differently. So, the minute she heard the track and the fact that she's got a lot of challenges to do, she immediately said yes to it.” 
 However, the toughest person to cast, according to Siddharth was Ridhi. He says, “Ridhi was the most difficult person to cast, because we wanted to cast a heroine and give her layers. We wanted somebody like   from 'Tanu Weds Manu', who is a complex and we needed a very strong actor. Just one day before we started shooting the show, Ridhi came to meet me. I promised her that this role will be a landmark in her career and I really hope it does become that, because we really tried portraying her that way and she has done a fabulous job.”
