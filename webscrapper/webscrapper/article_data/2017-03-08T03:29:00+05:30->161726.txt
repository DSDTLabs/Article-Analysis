Nagpur: Hearing of the case in which former chairman of ICICI Bank   has been made one of the respondents has been deferred to March 27. Kamath, along with nine other officers of the bank, has been served a notice by the district judge in this 10-year-old litigation. The petitioner has alleged of high-handedness by the loan recovery officials of the bank.

 The plaintiff, Prashant Deshmukh, says he had taken a loan from the bank to buy a car but was manhandled when he could not pay one of the instalments. The case was disposed off by the magisterial court where it was first heard. Later, Deshmukh appealed before the district court.
 
 “The court has served the notice to Kamath and others on February 10,” said Deshmukh’s lawyer Sashank Savdekar. Kamath’s counsel said on Tuesday that there is no intimation of the notice having been served. Kamath is currently the head of the BRICS Development Bank.
 
 Savdekar argued that Manish Johrarpurkar, who appeared for Kamath, was the lawyer who had represented him so far. “Instead, he represented the other respondents,” he said. 
 
 The court will wait till March 27 for the notice to reach Kamath. “If he does not respond, we will insist that a non-bailable warrant (NBW) be issued against Kamath,” said Savdekar after the hearing.
 
 According to Deshmukh’s petition, on getting a notice from the bank he arranged Rs25,000 of the defaulted instalment and reached the bank’s office. He was manhandled and the cash was snatched away from him, reads the petition.
