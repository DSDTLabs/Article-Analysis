Nagpur: Indira Gandhi Government Medical College and Hospital (IGGMCH) dean Dr Meenakshi Gajbhiye booked for allegedly accepting a bribe on Monday surrendered before the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Wednesday. 

 Gajbhiye’s co-accused in the case, Vijay Mishra, the mess contractor of the college had surrendered on Tuesday. A special court remanded him in ACB custody till January 20. The delay in Dr Gajbhiye’s arrest—she attended office on Monday evening and Tuesday —had raised several eyebrows. ACB could not arrest her on Monday following Supreme Court guidelines that prohibit arrest of women after sunset. On Tuesday, Gajbhiye visited her office instead of turning up at the ACB office. She also filed an anticipatory bail application even as the ACB kept on searching for her. ACB sources did not rule out Gajbhiye’s attempts to destroy evidence
