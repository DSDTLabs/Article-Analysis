KOCHI: The district administration will take stringent action against those who torture domesticated elephants in the name of temple and festival processions, district authorities said on Monday. 

 The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by district collector   about the protection of elephants. The emergency meeting was convened by the collector on the backdrop of several instances of cruelty against the elephants, including the incident at   temple where an   with severely infested wounds on its legs was used for temple parade.
 
 The collector stated that only assistant forest veterinary officer of the forestry department is authorized to issue fitness certificates. A panel comprising of five government veterinary doctors will be formed to issue the certificates once the festival season concludes. The validity of such certificates will be for 15 days only.
