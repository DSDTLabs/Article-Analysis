NAGPUR:   (NU) is yet to finalize its  , process for which had started last year. On January 3, TOI had reported that NU was in the process of developing a software to curb plagiarism in   (PhD) theses. 

 Pro vice-chancellor Pramod   had told TOI the policy being formulated for getting the software would be finalized within a month. However, over five months have passed but the committee set up to finalize the policy is yet to take a call. Last week, Yeole told TOI the policy would be finalized this month.
 
 On Tuesday, when TOI again called him to check for updates, he did not respond. He also didn’t respond to TOI’s SMS about the delay and the cost NU would be incurring in buying the software or the fee being paid to the software company. Yeole had revealed the university’s plans to frame the policy after TOI pointed out the absence of PhD thesis from NU website. 
 
 The university has been accepting soft copies since 2009 as per UGC norms but it was not putting them online. Yeole had explained the NU’s inability to upload PhD thesis online because of lack of an anti-plagiarism policy. A committee led by him held several meetings to discuss the modalities such as a permissible limit in duplication of content. 
 
 Last year, NU also switched to online registration for PhD candidates as part of its ongoing reforms. The university had approached an agency to develop an anti-plagiarism software. Once finalized, it wouldn’t be accepting a thesis unless researchers submit a certificate generated by the software attesting to originality of the work.
