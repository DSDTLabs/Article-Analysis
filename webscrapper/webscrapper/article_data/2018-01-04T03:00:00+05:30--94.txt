Ponda: A fire broke out in an automobile garage at Pansulem-Dharbandora on Wednesday gutting goods worth Rs. 2.5 lakh, emergency and fire services personnel said. Ponda station fire officer Sushil Morajkar said they are still ascertaining the exact loss. The garage had some automobile spare parts. The inflammable oils caught fire and the owners attempts to douse the flames with water were futile. Morajkar said they used foam to control the fire that had engulfed the oil cans. Water was, however, used to cool down the burnt spare parts and premises. The firemen used two fire tenders and a gallon of foam to control the blaze.
