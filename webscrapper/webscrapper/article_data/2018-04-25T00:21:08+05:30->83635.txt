Jaipur: The state forest department has now decided to bring cheetals (spotted  ) from Bikaner zoo to boost the food chain after the introduction of big cats in the Darrah range of Mukundra Hills National Park (MHNP). 

 The department is now focusing on augmentation of the prey base, as recently relocated tiger-Mirja, christened MT-I, was released in 82 sq km area of wild. A forest official at Bikaner range said, “Nearly 80 cheetals will be soon sent to the Mukundra. There number of cheetals, which were rescued and brought to the zoo, has increased. The introduction of more cheetals at MHNP would balance the ecosystem and tiger would not stray outside, if adequate food is available at the park.”
 
 After successful relocation of tiger MT-1, the state wildlife department brought over 100 cheetals from Rashtrapati Bhavan (New Delhi). Cheetals, which is a species native to the Indian subcontinent will be released in 8000 sq meter enclosed area developed by the MHNP administration. 
 
 The wildlife conservationists earlier had voiced concerns over adequate prey base before releasing the tigers in the reserve. The prey base was a major concern as it was available only in pockets. Augmentation of prey base was necessary as tiger can find rich prey only in Jhamra pocket of Darrah. 
 
 A senior forest department official said, “We have proposed to release more than 250 cheetals in MHNP. Recently, over hundred cheetals were brought from New Delhi, the department will also shift more herbivorous from Bikanear and Kota zoo. The process to take permission for shifting has been started.”
