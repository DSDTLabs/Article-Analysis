Pune: Member of Parliament Anil Shirole has written to defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman about an in-principle approval for the land in Khadki area for the Pune Metro and Bus Rapid Transit System projects. The land is with defence establishments. 

 Shirole, in his letter, pointed out the state government has increased the width of old Pune-Mumbai highway between Wakdewadi and Harris Bridge. 
 
 There is a plan to implement the BRTS on the old Pune-Mumbai highway up to Harris Bridge and the elevated metro has also been aligned along the same route.
 
 The entire stretch from Wakdewadi up to Harris bridge is 5.7 km of which 2.2 km section is under various defence establishments. 
 
 “The urban development department has requested an in-principle approval from the defence minister for the working permissions and land acquisition for the Metro and BRTS,” Shirole said in his letter.
 
 MahaMetro has already started with the civil work on the Pimpri-Range Hills metro segment. As per the plan, after Harris bridge, the metro will travel along the Pune-Mumbai highway up to Khadki police station after which the line is expected to cross the railway lines towards Range Hills.
 
 Shirole said the issue has been under discussion at various levels. Municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar has already written to the estate officer of Khadki Cantonment board pertaining to handing over of land and allowing the work.
 
 MahaMetro Rail Corporation officials said discussions were underway for possession of four hectares required for the project. Joint discussions were on with PMC and defence establishments, they said.
