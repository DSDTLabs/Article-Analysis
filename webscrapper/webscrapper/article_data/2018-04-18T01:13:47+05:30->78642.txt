NEW DELHI: A 78-year-old man was found murdered at his home in west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden on Tuesday evening. Police suspect   as the   behind the  .

 The victim, Jugal Kishore, lived with his wife, Shashi, on the second floor of a building in J-block. The couple’s three children are married and lived separately. The incident took place around 7pm, when Kishore was alone at home as Shashi had gone for a walk in a nearby park. When Shashi returned at 7.28pm she found Kishore lying in a pool of blood beside his bed. 
 
 Police said that Kishore’s throat was slit with a knife and the house was found vandalised with valuables missing. Officers said that the elderly man may have resisted a robbery attempt, resulting in a scuffle. There were injury marks on his other body parts also. The body has been sent for postmortem. Preliminary probe suggested that the killers might have used a kitchen knife. 
 
 Neighbours described the couple as friendly and warm. They said that Kishore had retired from the Central Public Works Department.
 
 Police suspect an insider’s role in the murder as the entry to the house was found to be friendly. Officers are verifying the activities of all the workers and labourers who worked in the locality. Cops are yet to ascertain whether there was any property dispute and are questioning the family members in this connection. 
 
 Shashi told police that Kishore was in the kitchen when she went to the park and the main door may not have been bolted. Family members suspect that apart from cash, some property papers were also missing.
 
 An FIR has been registered at the local police station and the Crime Branch has also been roped in for assistance. 
 
 A driver from the adjacent apartment has been detained for questioning.
