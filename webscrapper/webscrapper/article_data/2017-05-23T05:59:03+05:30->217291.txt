BERHAMPUR: A 23-year-old man - the father of a girl - was arrested from   in   on Monday for allegedly kidnapping his own 13-year-old sister-in-law and raping her through the course of a week. 

 The accused was identified as Sangram Gantayat of Dasapalla in Nayagarh district. He is father to a two-and-half-year-old girl.
 
 "The victim, who is Sangram's wife's sister, has been rescued from captivity and medical tests have been conducted on both the survivor and the accused," said Gochhapada police station officer-in-charge, Mrutunjay Pradhan. 
 
 Police have registered a case against Sangram after the girl's mother lodged a complaint with the police. According to her mother, Sangram had allegedly kidnapped the girl on May 16 from her house. He then raped her repeatedly at different places in the area. "We rescued the girl after receiving a tip-off," said Pradhan.
 
 In Kandhamal's Pirigiguda, meanwhile, police arrested three persons, one of them a 20-year-old, on Sunday for raping a minor girl.
 
 "Deepak Ganda of Dimirikhola and two of his friends, Kutuma Ganda and Suman Behera of the same village, had kidnapped the 14-year old on May 17," said A K Ghadei, inspector-in-charge of the Khajuripada police station. The girl, said Ghadei, was rescued from Kerida which falls under the Phulbani Sadara police station's limits. 
 
 Police said Deepak had allegedly promised to marry the girl. On May 17, however, he and his two friends took her on a motorcycle from Pirigiguda to Dimirikhola. 
 
 Following an FIR by the girl's father, police have registered a case and started investigation.
