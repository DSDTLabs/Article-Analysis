 “We are planning strategies to deal with specific problems faced by people in urban areas like garbage disposal,” said CPM central committee member A  . The CPM, which controls majority of municipal corporations in the state, can use such opportunities to win the confidence of urban people, feels the party leadership.
 
 In the district conferences held at Thiruvananthapuram and  , delegates pointed out the difficulty in breaking into gated communities. While party members can hold door-to door campaigns easily in residential areas, they have no access to gated communities.
 
 The party has initiated steps to create ‘fellow traveller groups’ within gated communities. “We have groups of friends in several apartment units in Kochi. We will emulate that model in other cities soon,” said a senior CPM leader, who is part of the think tank working on urban issues. Vijayaraghavan said while it was easier for them to identify residents in rural areas through family connections and friends, this is not possible in apartments in cities with a largely floating population.
 
 The state conference has decided to formulate a strategy to guide CPM’s   to expand base.
