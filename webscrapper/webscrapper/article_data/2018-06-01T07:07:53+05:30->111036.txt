BENGALURU: A 28-year-old labourer latched the neighbouring sheds from outside in the wee hours of Thursday minutes before stabbing his 25-year-old wife to death in Hullahalli village near Bannerghatta.

 Police said Anusuja’s husband Sabu alias   was missing. They were from Sedam in Kalaburagi district.
 
 Police said Sabu and Anusuja married four years ago, came to Hullahalli and began working at a cement factory. They lived in a makeshift shed in the factory. There were two families residing on the factory premises. The couple fought on Wednesday night after Sabu came home drunk. He abused his wife, saying she couldn’t conceive. They calmed down for a few hours.
 
 But, neighbours woke up to Anusuja’s screams around 2.30am. They tried to come out of their sheds but realised they had been locked from outside. Sabu fled the spot around 4am after killing his wife.
 
 Anusuja’s body has been handed over to her parents after the postmortem at Victoria Hospital. Police said the reason for the murder will be revealed once they nab Sabu.
