DEHRADUN: Sleuths of Uttarakhand Special Task Force (STF) late on Sunday busted a fake job racket and arrested three people, including the gang kingpin.   The accused, identified as Deepak Pridar, Aadesh Singh and Pankaj Kapoor, were nabbed from Badripur area of Dehradun. All three are Dehradun residents and were running a fake job racket from an illegal call centre set up in a rented shop, a STF official said.    “We got information that a gang was running a fake job racket from Dehradun and cheated hundreds of unemployed youth from across the country. According to an estimate, they have duped almost Rs 40-50 lakh from the victims and the figure could be more,” said Ridhim Agarwal, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) STF.    On the basis of little information such as mobile numbers and bank account details, the STF rounded up the accused.    “During investigation, we found out that the mobile numbers from which they used to call the job seekers and the bank accounts on which money was deposited were opened on fake ID’s. We came to know that they were running the racket from Badripur area and after receiving a tip-off we arrested three people,” Agarwal said.    Mastermind Deepak Paridar said that they used to hack data of job seekers from timesjobs.com and monster.com and call them with assurance of providing jobs. Police said that the accused told them that they gave Rs 23,000 to the job portals to provide them with 100 resumes for 70 days. Police is, however, verifying the claims.    According to the STF, the gang used to ask unemployed youth to deposit Rs 1,900 as registration fee initially and later Rs 5,600 as verification fees. They also charged an additional Rs 10,000 for opening a bank account. STF is trying to gather information on accounts details where the duped money could have been deposited.    Meanwhile, a cash reward of Rs 2,500 has been announced for the team that arrested the three accused.
