KRISHNAGIRI: Blatant disregard for rules resulted in chaos during the ‘eruthu vidum vizha’, a variant of  , at two places in   district on Sunday where three were killed. And all the victims were spectators.

 Police claimed that only one was fatally knocked down by a bull, while one died of cardiac arrest and another due to suffocation. In addition to the fatalities, about 50 men sustained injuries.
 
 Police identified one the deceased at Bargur event as 34-year-old L Sanmoorthy of Paichal village near Puliyankuttai in Vellore district. Sanmoorthi’s leg got entwined in a rope tied to a bull and was pulled down. “He sustained head injury in the fall and died on the way to hospital,’’ said a police officer.
 
 The other deceased at the same event, a 60-year-old man, could not be identified, as he had come alone to watch the event. Efforts are on to trace his identity. A bull bumped into him, leaving him with a severe head injury that took his life.
 
 The third died at another   near Rayakottai. Police said  , 25, of MGR Nagar in Rayakottai died of suffocation. He was a spectator and got stuck in the crowd. Police said he was in an inebriated condition and got trapped in the midst of the milling crowd that attempted to move away when a bull charged towards them. “He suffocated and died,” police said.
 
 In both these places, there was no semblance of adherence to rules as even the mandatory barricading was not done.
