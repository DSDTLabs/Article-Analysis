AHMEDABAD: After 35 years of delays, the jinxed road connecting western Ahmedabad directly to the airport passing beside an army ammunition dump in Hansol finally received approval from the   department. Last year the standing committee had asked the state   to intervene and decide whether a TP road could be built and subsequently a bridge with a second barrage could be built across the Sabarmati.

 The second barrage is crucial for storing 15 days of water supply for Ahmedabad. The barrage at Hansol will also open up real estate oppurtunities by extending the riverfront project to Gandhinagar.
 
 The approval from the state UDD is yet to provide an explanation for the security of the army ammunition dump. Over the 11 years there have been intense consultations and several rounds of convincing the ministry of defence to allow the   to pass beside the ammunition dump. 
 
 In its proposal,   (AMC) agreed to spend Rs 21 crore on building a thick wall to protect the dump. The wall is to be 10 feet high and several feet thick while the road will be TP road and 24-metres wide.
 
 “Though the army has been warning of   on the ammunition dump if a road is allowed next to it, in the last few years, there has been no clarity of whether the Army has agreed in principle,” says a senior AMC official.
