Visakhapatnam: The Waltair division of East Coast Railway (ECoR) has prepared an action plan to take up monsoon maintenance works to ensure smooth running of trains. Around 30 major works have been identified at a cost of Rs 20 crore.

 The works have been identified by the railways in a joint inspection carried out with help of the state government officials in the local railway station limits. When contacted, ECoR chief public relations officer JP Mishra said: “We have prepared the action plan to take up the maintenance works of the railway network in view of the monsoon. The major works have been identified in the Kottavalasa-Kirandul (KK) and Koraput-Rayagada (KR) lines under the Waltair division.”
 
 Speaking to TOI, Waltair divisional railway manager MS Mathur said: “The work is being taken up in phases. Wire netting, retaining walls, water drains construction, etc will be taken up. Apart from these we have hired machinery including poclains which are always kept ready in times of emergency.”
 
 Cleaning of culverts, desilting of side drains and installations of pumps were being taken up in the division, Mathur added.
 
 “More attention will be paid to certain sections which could be flood prone such as near huge water storage tanks, rivers and in some places in the KK and KR railway lines. Chances of landslides are more in the KK line as the line passes through the hills and forests” said another official from the mechanical department.
 
 Special attention is being given to the maintenance of overhead equipment which includes cleaning of insulators, checking of protective screens, protection of catenary wires and earthing,” the official said.
