HYDERABAD: The   carried out by the three agencies that probed the   incident conclusively led to the prosecutionâ€™s case collapsing like a pack of cards and acquittal of all the accused persons. With the result that even 11 years after the incident, there is no clarity as to who actually carried the blasts.

 Soon after the incident in   on May 18, 2007, in which 16 persons were killed (11in the   and five due to police firing), the case was probed by the Hussaini
 
 Alam police for the first two months. The police pointed the finger of suspicion at Bangladesh-based Harkat Ul Jihad Al Islami and rounded up a few local youths on the charge that they triggered the blasts.
 
 The CBI then took over the case and in the first chargesheet in the case, named a few persons belonging to the RSS and Hindu Vichar Manch, including Naba Kumar Sarkar alias Swami Aseemananda of the Van Vasi Kalyan Ashram, a   NGO, as accused. The case was then taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) from the CBI in 2011.
