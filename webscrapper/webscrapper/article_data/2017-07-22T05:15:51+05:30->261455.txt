PUNE: The state had a   of late, with the central Maharashtra being the biggest beneficiary. The subdivision, including Pune, recorded the best rainfall in the past six years between June 1 and July 20. Marathwada and Vidarbha, reeling from stresses of a dry patch, also salvaged their rainfall deficiency with the rain quantum till July 20 this year being the second highest in the past four years. 

 Similar story ensues for the Konkan-Goa belt in state, recording over 1,600mm rainfall since June 1 to July 20 this year - the second highest in the past four years for the subdivision.
 
 What worked in Maharashtra's favour, especially from mid-July, was the unique placement of monsoon systems over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal that provided continuous rain to the state.
 
 A senior Met department official told TOI that the central or Madhya Maharashtra had benefited from the recent rain in particular. "The positioning of the monsoon systems was such that the central Maharashtra drew the maximum benefit in terms of 'surplus' rain. Rainfall was good across Maharashtra, beginning from July 13 or 14," the official said. 
 
 The rainfall in Maharashtra from July 13 or 14 onwards began filling up deficits across most subdivisions in state, including Madhya Maharashtra and Marathwada.
 
 Vidarbha, lagging behind with (-24%) rainfall deficiency till July 18, is now almost in the clear with its shortfall dipping to -5% till July 20.
