 In the morning, locals of Bamuni Ai village at Roha in Nagaon district, some 101 km from here, found Sadhoni and her nine-year-old son, Ratan, lying unconscious inside their residence. All of them had foam stuffed in their mouth and were taken to hospital immediately. 
 
 A senior police official said, "While Sadhoni is struggling for life, her son was declared brought dead. After she regained consciousness, she confessed that she and her son consumed pesticides and that she had thrown away her five-year-old daughter, Senimai, in the nearby Kolong River."
 
 A team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) is conducting a search operation in the river. However, the girl's body is yet to be found. 
 
 Though Nagaon Police are yet to ascertain the cause behind the heinous act, sources said poor financial condition of the family might have forced her to take this extreme step. A source said, "Her husband Ranjit Das lives in Kerala and the family has been under tremendous stress for the last couple of months because of debts. The incident might be an outcome of the woman's depression."
 
 Police are waiting for Sadhoni to be fully stable to record her statement. Nagaon Police are going to register a murder case against her for killing her children.
