PATNA: Students from classes I to VIII who did not fare well in the half-early examination conducted by the state government will be given extra tuitions to help them improve their performance in the final examination scheduled from March 12 to 18. 

 A letter in this regard has been sent by Bihar Education Project Council (BEPC)’s state programme officer Rajiv Ranjan Prasad to all the district education officers (DEOs) and district programme officers (DPOs) of elementary education and Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA).
 
 The letter dated January 16 has directed the DEOs and DPOs to arrange additional facilities for   and properly monitor the implementation of the initiative.
 
 Altogether 80.69% — or 1,37,81,831 — of the classes I to VIII students studying under the SSA in Bihar had written the half-early examinations in October last year. Only 7.24% of them could secure grade ‘A’, which is awarded to 81% to 100% scorers. 
 
 Around 39.56% students scored 61% to 80% to get grade ‘B’ and 41.81% students got ‘C’ as they fetched 41%-60%. Grade ‘D’ (33%-40%) was awarded to 9.21% students and grade ‘E’ (0-32%) to 3.5% students.
 
 Those getting grades ‘C’, ‘D’ and ‘E’ have been put under the category of ‘learning deficit’. “Extra classes will be conducted for two hours for these students every day. Their weak areas will also be identified,” Prasad told TOI on Thursday.
 
 SSA sources said a meeting in this regard would be convened by the BEPC later this month.
