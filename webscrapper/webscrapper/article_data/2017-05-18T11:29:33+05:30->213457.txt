PUNE: A six-year-old girl   at Fatimanagar Chowk on Shivarkar road died after she was knocked down dead by a speeding   on Tuesday evening.

 The victim, Laxmi Durgesh Bhandari of Gosavi Vasti, and her elder sister, Sarita (10), were running behind vehicles for alms when the tempo ran over Laxmi. 
 
 Their mother, Manjakka (32), was selling combs and other plastic toys on the footpath at the time of the accident. Their father is a cook and works with a local caterer.
 
 Wanowrie police sub-inspector S V Jadhav said, “Tempo driver Laxman Vitthal Ingle (49) of Vaiduwadi in Hadapsar has been arrested for reckless driving after Manjakka lodged a complaint. The victim’s family belongs to Solapur and migrated to Pune about five years ago in search of employment.”
 
 Jadhav said, “The tempo was heading towards Fatimanagar Chowk from Jambhulkar Chowk and the accident occurred before the Fatimanagar Chowk. There were few road users on the spot at the time of the accident. The driver told the police that he failed to locate the child, who came running towards the vehicle from the other side of the road. The girl came under the front wheel of the tempo and died of head injuries.”
 
 Nearby shopkeepers claimed about five different families came to the chowk alternatively and begged alms or sold trivial articles to motorists. “The children keep running on the road risking their lives. We always fear what will happen when the signal turns green and these boys or girls are on the middle of the road,” shopkeeper Santosh Jambhulkar said.
