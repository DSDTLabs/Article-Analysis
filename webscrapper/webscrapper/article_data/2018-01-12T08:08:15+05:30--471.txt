AHMEDABAD: What can your eyes reveal? A lot — if reviewed by the right technology.  , a project developed by  ,  , has been short-listed from the Army Technology (ARTECH) Seminar in New Delhi and will be shown to PM Narendra Modi on Army Day (January 15).

 The project, measuring eye-movement, works on cognition concepts and identifies persons suffering from depression. The initiative is aimed at identifying soldiers with depression and suicidal or violent tendencies arising from it.
 
 Prof Lahiri told TOI that the idea stemmed from her patented technology called ‘Smart Eye’, which analyzes the gaze through computer algorithms. “Unlike other psychological tests, this screening method doesn’t require a question and answer session. A person is asked to be engaged in computerized cognitive activities where they have to look at the screen. The cameras track the eye movement and analyze the patterns to predict the condition. The pilot study on 50 individuals showed encouraging results,” she said.
 
 Two other projects from IIT-Gn presented at the event focused on technology for military operations in high altitude. They were an aerosol-based fire detection and suppression system and technology-based rehabilitation for static and dynamic balance for individuals with movement disorders.
