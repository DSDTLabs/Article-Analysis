NEW DELHI: Prime Minister   alleged on Monday that the   (SP) and the BSP have criticized demonetisation because "no notice was given them" that it was going to happen.

 He also took a jibe at former Uttar Pradesh chief minister, the BSP's  . 
 
 "Behanji (Mayawati) said government was not ready (for demonetisation) but actually she was not ready. She didn't get time," he said, adding that "BSP is now Behenji Sampati Party".
 
 Modi further blamed both SP and BSP for ruining Bundelkhand and appealed people to vote them out of the region.
 
 "SP, Congress and BSP, all these are sides of the same coin. These polls aren't just to choose a government, it's for Bundelkhand to decide whether they want to get rid of SP, BSP," he added.
 
 Modi blamed these parties for the "backwardness" of Bundelkhand. 
 
 "Uttar Pradesh is the most backward in India, and Bundelkhand most backward in the state because of these governments," he said while promising special provisions for implementing policies in the region.
 
 Modi has been campaigning for the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh elections as the face of the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the state's ongoing seven-phase polls, Orai will vote on February 23.
