CHANDIGARH: Protesting against the delay in release of funds under the post matric scholarship scheme, Punjab   (PYC) workers, led by its president Amarpreet Singh  , faced water cannons as they held tried to march to the   office from the Punjab Congress Bhawan. They were stopped and rounded up by the police.

 Lally claimed that PYC general secretary Jaswinder Singh Jassi was hit in the eye by the strong water current and had to be admitted to the PGI. The PYC workers raised slogans against the Modi government and alleged that it had “anti-Dalit policies.”
 
 Lally said in the current year the Centre had just released only Rs 115.73 crore to Punjab despite the state sending utilization certificate after disbursal of funds.
 
 He said it is disheartening to see the Centre ignoring the cause of welfare of Dalit students in the state where 32% of population belong to the   community. He further said the delay in sanctioning of funds will impact the lives of huge number of students. Lally said the Youth Congress has been raising the voice of the SC students for long and memorandums in this regard were submitted to the DCs in the state.
