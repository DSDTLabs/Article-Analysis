CHENNAI: Enviu, a Dutch company that works with social impact enterprises on Monday said it has received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for a faecal management project in India. SaniNation, based out of Bengaluru will look out for suitable partners in India implement the program.

 “Current practices in India cause a serious threat to our environment and to human health in India. Our attempt is to resolve the sanitation criss and convert human waste into a valuable resource,” said Dylan D’Costa, director, SaniNation which curates promising business models from across the globe and adopts these to the local context.
 
 “Faecal Sludge Management is not typically a hot topic at the dining table. The wow-factor is missing. However, human waste treatment, reuse and its conversion into valuable by-products presents an underexplored business opportunity. India, with its urban population and manufacturing focus is the ideal place to operate such a project as people will see value,” said Luan Nio Enviu.
 
 SaniNation is exploring various models including one implemented in Rwanda by Pivot. “The operating plant in Rwanda now takes in 100 cubic meters of faecal sludge everyday which generates 1 tonne of fuel whihc is being supplied to customers,” said Timothy Wade, COO, Pivot. SaniNation is talking to multiple partners across southern states except Kerala including Puduchery based Freshrooms LifeSciences to enter into partnerships/joint ventures by the end of 2017.
