 T he stalking and subsequent injuries to the girl had triggered unrest in the port town last December. Ganesh allegedly stalked the Class 9 girl when she walked through a forest area to her high school 8km from her house. Her mother informed gram panchayat members who admonished Ganesh. 
 
 Meanwhile, communal clashes broke out in the taluk in December due to which she couldn't go to sch ool for four days. Unaware of exams in school, she missed one. This added to her fear and she used a thorn to inflict injuries on her hand. When she was buying a bandage to dress the wound, the shop owner asked her about it. She allegedly lied that she sustained injuries while trying to escape from two youths trying to kidnap her. The shopkeeper and villagers claimed they'd seen two youths from another community moving around on a bike. Soon, this false news spread in the taluk and resulted in another bout of violence. Later, she revealed the truth to a magistrate, and doctors certified that her injuries were self-inflicted. Ganesh has been booked under the Pocso Act tnn .
