ROHTAK: Hostellers, including girls of the   (CUH), continued their protest on the second day on the campus, demanding suspension of all three wardens. They alleged that the three did not play a   in providing help to one of the students who met with an accident recently.

 The hostellers alleged that the competent authoritiesâ€™ reaction was found lacking when a student, Saurav Kumar of Jammu, who studies in the department of physics (semester IV), met with an accident around 9 pm on the Mahendergarh-Dadri road on Thursday and got seriously injured. They alleged that they kept pleading with hostel wardens to take him to Rewari hospital immediately, but they delayed it by an hour.
 
 Levelling fresh allegations, the protesters said that some outsiders had barged on the campus on Friday night around 8 pm and misbehaved with some girl hostellers to demoralise them from taking part in the ongoing protest. Later, some boys hostellers intervened and saved the situation from getting worse. They demanded strict action against outsiders for misbehaving with the girl students. They reiterated their demand of having of a full-time medical officer and availability of ambulance round the clock on the university campus. 
 
 Interestingly, the hostellers who were to participate in various cultural activities during the scheduled convocation ceremony on Saturday preferred to keep a distance from the protest. 
 
 Rubbishing the suspension demands, CUH registrar Ram Dutt claimed that there was no delay in dispatching help to the road mishap victim. In fact, the wardens were the ones who were there with him during the emergency situation and even spent money from their own pockets, he added. 
 
 On other allegations, Dutt said that it seemed that students were getting provoked by outsiders for some other reasons than the real issues.
