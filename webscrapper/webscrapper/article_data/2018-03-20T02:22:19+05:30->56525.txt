NEW DELHI: The   on Monday witnessed a major fire incident spreading to the neighbouring area.

 An official of Delhi Fire Service said that the fire broke out between 12pm and 1pm after locals reported the incident. The fire tenders had to be driven up to the waste mound to control the flames.
 
 Civic officials managing the landfill site said that flames were brought under control within first hour of being reported and no major damage has occurred. Official added that frequency of such incidents is expected to rise as we approach summer. 
 
 “It has nothing to do with fresh garbage being dumped on the site. The decomposition of garbage that has accumulated over so many years is accelerated with rise in temperature,” he added.
 
 Portion of   landfill site had collapsed in September last year killing two people. After the accident,   was ordered to shift the dumping site to an alternate location, but no new space could be found. This site should have been shut down in 2006 itself. But, Ghazipur, at three times the safe height, continues to receive east Delhi’s garbage.
