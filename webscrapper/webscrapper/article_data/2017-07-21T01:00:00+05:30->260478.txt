CHHAPRA: Following scrutiny of nomination papers, campaigning for Chhapra civic elections scheduled on August 6, picks up pace with candidates addressing rallies. 

 As many as 300 candidates are in fray after cancellation of 19 nominations on technical grounds for the upcoming   to 45 seats in Chhapra Municipal Council.
 
 Returning officer-cum-Saran ADM Arun Kumar on Thursday said ward number 4 has maximum 17 candidates, while ward number 10, 22, 23, 34 and 39 have three candidates each. “A large number of women, even in unreserved wards are in fray. In ward No 4, out of 17 candidates 12 are women.” 
 
 “Steps have been initiated to get the approval of the state election commission for setting up polling booths. The Sadar SDO has been directed to maintain law and order and take punitive action against the law breakers, while contesting candidates have been allowed to use one four-wheeler and two bikes during canvassing. They have been directed to spend not more than Rs 30,000 for election,” said the ADM.
 
 Candidates have been allotted symbols and trained on dos and dont’s keeping in view the enforcement of the model code of conduct. They have been advised to seek permission of the district administration before taking out any procession during this period. 
 
 Meanwhile, several candidates have raised their voice against alleged irregularities made in delimitation of the wards. A former ward councillor Saheb Hussain even tried to immolate himself on Tuesday on the premises of Saran collectorate to protest ‘faulty delimitation’. However, local police foiled his attempt and took him to the Town police station. Hussain was later released on bail by the police.
