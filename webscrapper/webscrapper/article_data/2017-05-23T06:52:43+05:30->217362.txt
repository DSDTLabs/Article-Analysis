THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The 10-year RI awarded to   was more than what convicts get in similar offences. This was because the prosecution moved a  , seeking enhanced punishment considering his track record.

 During the last leg of the trial, the prosecution had moved the submission seeking permission to invoke Section 75 of IPC, which pertains to enhancement of punishment for offences considering previous convictions.
 
 The judge then directed the prosecution to file an additional chargesheet, listing his previous crimes, before May 22. The judge on Monday, took up the chargesheet for hearing arguments during the morning session. The prosecution had mainly listed eight cases, in which Davinder had been convicted earlier, in the additional chargesheet.
 
 “In normal conditions the said offences would get a punishment of only five to seven years ,” public prosecutor   said. The prosecution argued for life sentence, citing that the convict’s track record was a testimony that he had no scope of reformation. Davinder admitted that he had been convicted before, but, claimed that those were all false cases. The judge accepted the prosecution’s arguments but set the imprisonment period to 10 years.
 
 The judge awarded 10 years for house trespass, seven for theft and two for dishonestly breaking open receptacle containing property. However, the sentences could be served concurrently.
 
 The time the convict spent in prison as an under trial –– four years and four months –– would also be considered as sentence period.
