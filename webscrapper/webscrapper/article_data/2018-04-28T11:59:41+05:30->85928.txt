NAGPUR: Top Maoist  , alias  , has been named in the first information report (FIR) filed by the police in the Rela-Kasnasur-Boriya encounter which claimed the lives of 33 Maoists (9 men and 24 women) on April 22. Also figuring in the FIR are several other Central Committee (CC) members of the banned outfit of Communist Party of India (Maoist).

 “As is the practice since a year, we always name all top Naxalites which include their general secretary, CC members and others. The logic of naming all is based on the conspiracy theory of Indian Penal Code (120B),” said   SP Abhinav Deshmukh who dispelled rumours that Ganapathy too was among the dead.
 
 As general secretary of the Maoists, Ganapathy is its topmost leader. Now, however, intelligence sources say that he has stepped down and been replaced by   who was the central military commission chief. Ganapathy carries more than Rs2 crores reward on his head while for Basavraj it is around Rs15 lakhs.
 
 There had been a steady rumour that Ganapathy was among the ones shot dead at   forest where at least four formations of the rebels — Perimili, Aheri Local Organizational squads (LOS), Gatta LOS and Platoon 7 — were present. The rebels, under two senior cadres of Divisional Committee Member (DVCM) and four other commander ranks, had assembled to conduct brainstorming sessions on the various aspects of the movement in the south Gadchiroli which is adjoining the Maoist fortress of Abhujmadh. 
 
 As reported by TOI, 16 bodies of the Naxalites were fished out of the waters of   on the day of the encounter. Two days later, after TOI brought to the notice of the cops, another 17 were found floating in the river.
 
 The post mortems of the Naxalites were conducted at the Gadchiroli district hospital. Police are yet announce the reports.
