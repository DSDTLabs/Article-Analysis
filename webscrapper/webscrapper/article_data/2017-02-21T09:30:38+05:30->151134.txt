BHOPAL: Issues such as the Katni hawala scam with the alleged involvement of a minister and illegal sand mining from the Narmada river is expected to rock the budget session in the state assembly. The five-week long session commences on Tuesday and is scheduled to end on March 31. But the Congress fears that when sensitive issues are raised against the ruling party, government might not permit the house to run for the full session.

 “This has been strategy of the ruling BJP to run away from the assembly, simply because opposition raises issues on the floor of the house,” said Bala Bachchan, the acting leader of opposition. “But we will see to it that there is no hindrance in running the house because we want discussions and debates.”
 
 The BJP government will be under attack with Dhruv Saxena’s alleged involvement in the ISI spy racket unearthed by the ATS recently. Dhruv Saxena’s photos with BJP leaders including chief minister   and BJP national general secretary   will be taken-up by the opposition.
 
 “We will also expose the truth behind the state government’s claim of providing agricultural loans at 0% interest,” Bachchan said. “Farmers who take these loans from cooperative banks have to return the loan by February 28 instead of the previous March 31 deadline. This new date of February 28 means inconvenience for the agrarian community. Wheat, mustard and gram are the major crops of the rabi harvest and end of February is too early to make the payment. The crops are still standing on the field, not ready for harvest. So, how will the farmer repay the loan?” Bachchan asked.
 
 Congress said distressed farmers will face hardships because a day after the February 28 deadline, the loans have to be repaid at 18% interest.
