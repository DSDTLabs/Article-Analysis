Mumbai: The   of   on Friday registered an FIR against  , founder of comic group   (AIB), for tweeting a meme on Prime Minister   by using the Snapchat dog filter. 

 He has been booked for defamation (IPC section 500) and publishing/ transmitting obscene material in electronic form (Section 67 of IT Act). Tanmay was summoned to the police station, where he recorded a statement saying he tweet the meme in the spirit of comedy and it was not intended to offend anyone.
 
 The AIB founder had posted the tweet on Wednesday. Reetesh Maheshwari, a Twitter user, who saw the meme shared it with the Mumbai police on the social networking site and sought legal action against AIB. The Mumbai Police forwarded the matter to the cyber police, which then registered a case.
 
 A cyber crime cell officer said they are collecting the IP address from which the tweet was posted. Mumbai police spokesperson, DCP Rashmi Karandikar said an FIR was registered after legal consultation. 
 
 As the tweet stirred up a controversy, Tanmay deleted the post. However, Tanmay continued to be trolled even after that. Tweeples also targeted the AIB accusing the group of insulting the national sentiment. Last year also, the group had found itself at the centre of a controversy over Tanmay's “roast“ of cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and singer Lata Mangeshkar. 
 
 Responding to Tanmay’s post, a Twitter user, Sahil (@sircaastic), tweeted: “AIB always gets under fire for their most unfunny jokes. First the sachin-lata thing, now the Modi meme. With fame and power, comes great responsibility.”
 
 Another user Maithun Kashmiri (@Being_Humor) said: “As I said in the morning. Your intentions matter the most. AIB's intention is not to make people laugh but to hurt. AIB will die eventually.”
