NAGPUR: The Nagpur Municipal Corporation ( ) water works department has proposed to dig 347 borewells at the cost of Rs3.55 crore to mitigate water crisis during summer 2018, which, according to the  , will come to end with arrival of monsoon in Vidarbha in June second week. The proposal raises a big question about NMC’s seriousness towards civic amenities and utilization of public funds.

 
 Standing committee chairman   has convened a meeting on June 5 to discuss and finalize 21 proposals, including construction of borewells. 
 
 As per the proposal for borewells, four private firms will be engaged to execute the works. The work orders will be issued in June second week. Then, the Ground Groundwater Survey and Development Agency ( ) will be asked to conduct technical study followed by execution of works. Thus, actual works are likely to begin in July and completed within 3-6 months.
 
 NMC official told TOI that the project got delayed due to lengthy administrative process. “Water works department prepared the project plan in December but took five months to take it to the standing committee,” he said.
 
 As reported by TOI on April 23, the NMC is all set to seek Rs325 crore special development assistance grants as second capital. The proposal to be submitted with the state government has been tabled before the standing committee for its approval. The civic body is seeking the grants for five years citing financial liabilities of Rs3,012.39 crore in the next five years. 
 
 Another proposal is to distribute e-rickshaws to 70 persons with special disabilities at the cost of Rs87.89 lakh. This is for the second time, the NMC would be distributing e-rickshaws among disabled persons. Couple of months ago, 63 disabled persons were given e-rickshaws of which three were women.
 
 The traffic department has once again moved the proposal to rope in a private agency to tow away vehicles from no-parking zones. The work will be done in association with the traffic police department. The committee had rejected the proposal couple of months ago.
 
 There is also a proposal to establish a panel of 8 shopkeepers for procurement of uniforms for NMC students at the cost of Rs1.40 crore. The plan is to distribute uniforms to the students on first day of new academic session.
