SHIMLA: Himachal Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (HPPCL)   of Rs 36.11 crore in   Bank (ADB)   despite being exempted from doing so by Government of India, a report of Comptroller and Auditor General of India has revealed.

 The report said civil works of Sawra Kuddu, Kashang and Sainj hydroelectric projects of HPPCL, funded by ADB, were awarded to two firms in February-March 2009 and June 2010.
 
 The bidding documents and contract agreements provided that all duties and taxes levied as per laws and regulations shall be included in the price bids. The contractors shall pay all taxes, duties and fees required to be made under the contracts.
 
 It said as per Government of India notification issued on August 28, 1995 and amended in November 1999, all goods falling under schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985, when supplied to the projects financed by the international organization and approved by the GOI, were exempted from excise duty.
 
 The audit scrutiny revealed that all three hydroelectric projects were eligible for excise  , but HPPCL failed to avail the intended benefit and paid excise duty of Rs 36.11 crore on excisable goods such as cement and steel used in the constructions of the projects during the period from April 2009 to December 2015.
 
 According to the report, the HPPCL management had said in August 2016 that the circular nowhere defined that this benefit of policy was meant for government companies or departments in whose works the materials were to be consumed. In fact, the circular clearly mentioned that the benefits should be availed by manufacturers and purchasers, the management had further said.
 
 The CAG said the reply is not tenable as the circular clearly defined that the   and duties is available to facilitate the completion of projects approved by the Government of India at a lesser cost.
