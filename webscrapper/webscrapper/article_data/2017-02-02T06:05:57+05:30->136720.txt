PATNA: It’s like stabbing people in their back again after the demonetisation, said the CPI-ML about the Budget presented in Parliament on Wednesday.

 “Coming close on the heels of the   ordered by PM  , the Budget has further stabbed in the back of people who were looking for some relief,” said ML general secretary  .
 
 He regretted the Budget does not compensate for the massive losses of income and livelihood caused by note ban. “Debt-ridden peasants badly needed a (loan) waiver, but there is none,” he said.
 
 Bhattacharya said the   on Tuesday suggested the need for Universal Basic Income, but the Budget has not made any move in that direction. Nor does it address the problem of growing inequality caused by increasing concentration of wealth, he said.
 
 The government has also devalued the railways and sabotaged the agenda of passenger amenities as well as railway safety and security, Bhattacharya said, and cautioned people against “Modinomics”.
 
 State CPI secretary Satya Narayan Singh called it a “populist” Budget, prepared with an eye on election in UP, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.
 
 Calling PM Modi a “dream merchant,” Singh said the Budget makes promises that seek to divert attention from Modi’s failed promises.
 
 “Finance minister Arun Jaitley referred to demonetisation and described the Budget as an attack on black money, but he did not talk about benami property, the money stashed in tax havens and the money converted into gold and silver,” Singh said.
