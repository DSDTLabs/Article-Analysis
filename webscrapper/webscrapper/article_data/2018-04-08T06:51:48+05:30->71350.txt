PANAJI: Close to 60 unaided schools across Goa remained shut on Saturday, in solidarity with the protest by National Independent Schools’ Association (NISA) at Ramlila Maidan in New Delhi held on the day. 

 The protest was held to demand for lesser government controls on independent schools. Unaided institutions in Goa, other than being closed, also held a rally of two-wheelers and four-wheelers on Saturday morning across Margao, Mapusa and Panaji.
 
 Though institutions in Goa said that authorities in the state have been very cooperative with independent schools operating here, the protest was organised to achieve the aim of greater autonomy for all schools. Teachers, some parents and even students joined the rally held by All Goa Government Recognized Unaided Schools Association (AGGRUSA). It culminated with rallies from Panaji, Margao and Mapusa converging at the parade ground in the capital city. At the protest, school heads raised objection to the reservation of 25% seats for children from poor families in private schools as provided under RTE.
 
 “The 25% reservation of seats ruleis a good initiative. But if a school blocks 25% of the seats, it messes up the whole system. It will mean the other children will have to bear the cost of education for the children who cannot afford it. And this puts pressure on finances. Schools may not be able to invest in their own upgradation,” said  , principal, Sunshine Worldwide School.
 
 Deepak Khaitan, founder member of AGGRUSA, and  , president, joined the rally in New Delhi on behalf of Goa’s unaided schools. 
 
 Nirmesh Tyagi, director,   said, “Every school from any board requires re-recognition after every three years. Schools follow the norms of the board, yet why is re-recognition required every three years? The process requires a lot of paperwork and follow-ups.”
