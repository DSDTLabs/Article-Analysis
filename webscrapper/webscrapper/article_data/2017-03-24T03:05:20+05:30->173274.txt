GURUGRAM: Residents of   in Sohna, a village in the Aravalis where a   was thrashed to death in November last year, reported two leopard   on Tuesday and Wednesday.

 Dev Prakash, a passer-by, who claims to have spotted a leopard, said, “It was around 5pm. I was in the fields when I saw the big cat. I immediately fled the place and alerted other villagers, but by the time the leopard had vanished.”
 
 The department has been sending a team to the area regularly for the last two days. “However, we haven’t found any pugmarks yet. Villagers many a time mistook civet cat or hyena for a leopard. We are also running a campaign to spread awareness among villagers to protect the wildlife,” said Shyam Sunder, district forest officer (wildlife), said. tnn
