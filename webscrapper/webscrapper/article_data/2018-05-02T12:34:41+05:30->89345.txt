VIJAYAWADA: Karnataka chief minister Siddharamaiah, who is seeking re-election in the upcoming assembly polls in the state, has written an open letter to Telugu-speaking people in his state, stating that he found "a knife sunk in the heart of   people" as the BJP has denied special category status and other benefits to the state after bifurcation. 

 Appealing to Telugu-speaking voters of the state, he recalled the unity of Telugu and Kannada people living together under   regime and claimed that "Telugus mingled with the culture and traditions of Kannada people and contributed a lot to the development of Karnataka state even after linguistic states were formed".
 
 On the 'knife' he found "sunk in the hearts of the Telugu people", Siddharamaiah said the BJP government which came to power after the 2014 elections "has completely ignored and neglected all those promises and did grave injustice to the people of Andhra Pradesh".
 
 "Without giving respect to the promises the then PM made on the floor of the Parliament and without respecting the Act passed by the same institution, the BJP has been insulting democracy and democratic institutions. Because of deliberate negligence in implementing the promises given in the Reorganisation Act by the Modi government, the people of both the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have been subjected to great loss," he wrote.
 
 The Karnataka CM recalled the BJP's promise on the SCS in the manifesto and also "at the foothills of Sree Lord Venkateswara in Tirupati". 
 
 "I know you will never forget the betrayal by Modi and the BJP to the people of AP," he appealed to the Telugu population in the state. "Telugu people can teach a befitting lesson to BJP for landing them (Telugus) in so many troubles and financial hardship due to their (BJP's) inaction and by deliberately giving a go-by to the special category status issue."
 
 He also took a dig at the Janata Dal-Secular, accusing it of working as the "B team of BJP" and exhorted the "Telugu people having enough wisdom to recognise the true colours of JD-S and teach them a lesson in the elections".
