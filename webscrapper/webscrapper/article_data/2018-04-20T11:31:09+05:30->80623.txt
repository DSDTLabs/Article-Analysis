It was an evening of celebrating Bangaliana with the right mix of music, poetry and adda. Guests enjoyed soulful poems read out by actor   and songs rendered by Sayani Palit,  , Sourendro and their team at the Far Pavilion of the club. This was perfectly complemented by an adda involving US Consul General  , wife Meeryung, Jawhar Sircar, designer   and others. While Meeryung stole the show with her rendition of Ekla cholo re, Craig looked dapper in dhuti and kurta.
 
 
 
 
  
 The club members were spotted letting their hair down at the do. When Soumyojit started singing Ke tumi Nandini, Gautam Nandy, deputy CEO,  , joked, “I can never afford to forget this song as it has my wife’s name in it,” and his friends broke into laughter. “It is a special moment to see Soumitra — the actor 
 who sang the song on screen — enjoying the number on stage,” Aslam, another guest, pointed out. The show ended with DL Roy’s Dhono dhanye pushpe bhora that had all the guests humming to the tune. 
 
 
 
  
 Dignitaries from different walks of life were seen enjoying the evening over delectable Bengali starters and wine. We spotted Dr Supratim Aakash Paul and his wife Indrani at 
 the do. “Nabobarsho should be celebrated with family and we are enjoying our time here with our parents,” said Dr Paul. Manzilat Fatima, a guest, said, “I loved Meeryung’s soprano rendition of Rabindrasangeet. She is mesmerising. Also, it is an honour to listen to Soumitra’s reading.”
 
 
 
  
 All’s well that ends well and what could be a better way to culminate the Bengali New Year adda than offering a delectable Bengali spread to the guests? From mangsher chop to chingrir cutlet and bharer cha in the starter and a full-on dinner with koraishutir kochuri, cholar dal, pulao, chitol maachher muithya and many more such items — the guests were seen gorging on the delicacies on offer.
