PUNE: The Pune regional transport authority (RTO) will soon be initiating a   to find out if drivers of vehicles carrying school children can handle emergency situations.

 Deputy regional transport officer Sanjay Raut told TOI that a meeting with Pune police commissioner Rashmi Shukla was slated to take place in the first week of June in which the finer details on the drive-cum-training programme would be decided and chalked out.
 
 “With the school opening after the  , the RTO plans to check how safe the vehicles are. The RTO is particularly concerned about the presence of fire extinguishers, and if they are in proper shape. We will also check if drivers and attendants know to handle them in case of an emergency. Furthermore, we will also check the drivers’ record and police verification in connection with their background. It is necessary that they have a character certificate issued by the cops. The number of seats in the vehicles and number of students travelling in them will also be checked. Vehicle attendants should have a list of the students in the vehicle with their contact details and blood group,” Raut said.
 
 Sources said that often, after long vacations, drivers or attendants of the vehicles tend to change, which necessitate the fresh checks. As per the RTO records, there are 3,700 vehicles, excluding autorickshaws, that transport children to schools.
 
 Another RTO official said another part of the drive was centred on training.
 
 “Drivers and attendants will be provided with basic training on how to react to an emergency, and ways to evacuate students. It is important that they know to use the fire extinguishers. If they don’t, the RTO, in coordination with the fire department, will give them a crash course,” he said.
