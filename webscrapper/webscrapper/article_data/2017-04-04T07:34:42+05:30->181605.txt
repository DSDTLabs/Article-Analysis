NOIDA/GREATER NOIDA: The foreigners   office (FRO) in   seems to be   to handle the large number of applications for   extension every day due to shortage of staff and lack of a detention centre. 

 While many residents said that they have encountered cases of students living on an expired visa in the past few years, a few from African community too admitted that there were some students who did not have any plans to leave India despite their visa getting expired. 
 
 The discrepancy in the number of Africans staying in India is clear in the statistics available from the FRO office and the Association of African Students in India (AASI). As per the records in FRO office, 568 African nationals are staying in Gautam Budh Nagar while the estimate of AASI indicates that nearly 4,000 students are residing in Gautam Budh Nagar.
 
 The FRO, a part of the Local Intelligence Unit (LIU), has only four staffers including an inspector, a sub inspector and two constables.
 
 “Usually the number of people coming for visa renewal varies between five to ten per day. Sometimes, we see as many as twenty,”said an FRO officer.
 
 “In Delhi, it takes just three weeks to get your visa renewed. In Noida, it might take over two months and sometimes, at least three months,” Umar Najeeb, coordinator, AASI told TOI.
 
 According to sources, a number of students who take online admission in one university take admission in a different university after reaching India. Such students eventually seek a visa renewal.
 
 Mahavir Singh, incharge, FRO said, “We have very few staff. Moreover, when we have to renew a licence, we have to check documents including the rent agreement, the bonafide certificate from the university, passport and police verification too. It is a long process,” he said.
