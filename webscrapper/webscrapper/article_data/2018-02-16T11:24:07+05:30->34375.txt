HYDERABAD: It was a ‘koya dora’ (tribal astrologer) who told cab driver K Rajashekar Goud to perform ‘narabali’ (human sacrifice) as a panacea for all problems, including his wife’s health issues, said police.

 The family got the advice during their visit to Sammakka Saralamma jatara at   two years ago. Egged by his wife and others, he kidnapped the infant, killed her on the shores of the Musi and later performed kshudra puja (black magic) at his house at Chilkanagar.
 
 According to police, prime accused Rajashekar’s wife   had been suffering from health issues for the past four years. Two years ago, the couple had visited Sammakka Saralamma, where they came across a ‘koya dora’, who advised them to go for ‘narabali’ of a girl child to get rid off the evil spirits haunting them.
 
 “Rajashekhar did not act on the advice immediately. He consulted three others who perform black magic— Syed Sha Mohamood Khaizar Pasha from Ghansi Bazar, T Srilatha from   and Mallarapu Laxminarayana Goud from Keesara — in the last two years. He did not get any positive result,” Rachakonda police commissioner Mahesh   said at a media briefing on Thursday. Finally, the couple decided to perform ‘narabali’ of a girl child. Srilatha reportedly provoked, encouraged and assisted her husband in commissioning the crime, police added.
 
 “That is how a superstition of a person led to the murder of a child,” Bhagwat said.
 
 After beheading the baby girl, aged between three and five months, on the shores of Musi around 12.45am on February 1. Rajashekar reached home by 3 am. The couple then performed rituals related to the ‘kshudra puja’ in the living room of their residence, keeping the severed head on an altar.
 
 “A bow and arrow, made of coconut leaf-midribs, and a few bamboo leaves tied like a broom were seized from their possession. At the time of the puja, the couple was alone at home. They sent their two kids along with other family members to a relative’s place,” Bhagwat added.
