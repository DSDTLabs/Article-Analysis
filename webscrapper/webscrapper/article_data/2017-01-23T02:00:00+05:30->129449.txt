PATNA: “School-children were forced to participate in   and at least 12 of them fainted across the state. There was no ambulance available at some places while some hospitals were found careless in handling the cases.  . 

 The government failed to adhere to its undertaking submitted in the high court regarding   and not to use force to ensure participation. Using lakhs of children for several hours to create a world record is unfortunate.”
