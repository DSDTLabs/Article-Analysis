 Chandigarh: For some, Yuvraj Singh may be a spent force, but not for Mumbai all-rounder  . The southpaw believes the veteran cricketer’s form will be the key to King XI Punjab’s success in the upcoming Indian Premiere League ( ).
 
 “Yuvraj’s form will play an important role for   this IPL. They are good on papers and I have a feeling it would be an interesting season for them,” Nayar told TOI on the sidelines of a television event in the city on Monday.
 
 And he added, “They have lots of dynamic players and match winners who are assets in IPL’s scheme of things. If they coordinate well, they can easily reach the play offs.”
 
 When asked about the in-form Mayank Agarwal, part of the Kings XI Punjab this season, Nayar said, “Look, history says those who have a brilliant run in the domestic season have failed in the IPL, but I hope Mayank can rewrite history.”
 
 Nayar also holds U-19 World Cup stars Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill in high esteem. “These two players have been a revelation. I have worked closely with Prithvi and I must say he has a good head above his shoulders. We have always rated him highly in Mumbai cricket. He is someone we should look forward to,” he said.
 
 On Shubman, he said, “I have followed him during the U-19 World Cup and have heard a lot about his work ethics. I believe he would certainly do well for the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and I am sure he has bright future ahead.”
