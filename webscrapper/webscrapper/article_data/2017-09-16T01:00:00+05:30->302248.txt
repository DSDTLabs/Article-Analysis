Music composer   was in Delhi recently to speak at EEMA's (Event and Entertainment Management Association) annual convention, where he engaged in a short conversation with television host  , talking about his source of inspiration and his method of working.

  
 When asked what inspires him, Rahman said, "As a composer, when you write for films, inspiration comes from the actor, the director's script. But when I do my own music, I do my first draft and then compose again and again until I get there." Abbas asserted, "You always get there." Rahman has earlier said in his interviews that he likes to watch a film first and then start scoring music.

  When asked how he creates his soulful Sufi songs, Rahman said, "Each one of us find inspiration in our own way. Some find it in the mentor, some in the goal. For me, it is the connect with infinity. The destruction of self is what one desires - fanna ho jana." Rahman also spoke about the influences from the east and the west on him and said there should be more foundations like his One Heart foundation in India to support musicians. Rahman also received a lot of compliments for not looking like a 50-year-old. When asked about the secret, he said, "When you are young you are old, but when you are old you are young, and that's the charm."
