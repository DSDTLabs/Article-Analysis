 “It is not only main roads that were clogged, even flyovers were not spared. Punjagutta flyover for instance was waterlogged and it took me over 15 minutes to cross it,” said  , a resident of Begumpet.
 
 Sludges were cleared from under the RUB in Malakpet, Telugu Talli flyover and near NMDC in   while near the Old P S in Begum Bazaar, the median on the road was removed to clear water logging and regularize traffic movement.
