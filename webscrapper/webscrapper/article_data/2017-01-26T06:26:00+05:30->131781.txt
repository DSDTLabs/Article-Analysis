Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court on Wednesday rejected the plea of Vilas Khadke, whose nomination for contesting   Graduates Constituency polls was rejected by the State Election Commission (SEC).

 His case was listed before a division bench comprising Justice Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Justice Swapna Joshi.
 
 According to the petitioner, he filled up the nomination form on January 17 with the returning officer in Amravati.
 
 However, several discrepancies were found in the form and the officer called him the next day for meeting to clear these.
 
 Despite repeated reminders, he failed to report to the officer leading to rejection of his nomination.
 
 Aggrieved by this, Khadke knocked the judiciary’s doors challenging the returning officer’s decision to reject his form.
