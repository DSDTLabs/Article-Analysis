MUMBAI:In a major green initiative,   has set up a biogas plant to use organic waste to fire up its kitchen stoves at its canteen in  .

 Western Railway’s chief public relations officer, Ravinder  , said that the solid waste management plant had a0.5 tonne capacity. The biogas will be used to cater to long-distance trains from Mumbai Central. 
 
 Waste from the base kitchen in Mumbai Central will be used too. Bhakar said, “The estimated organic waste from these units will be between 200-250 kg. 
 
 But the plant can handle 500 kg of organic waste each day.” Western Railway authorities said that if the plant is ope- rated at maximum capacity, the gas generated will fill a liquefied petroleum gas cylinder each day. 
 
 But as the quantum of waste generated is low, the biogas produced will be equivalent to one-fourth of a cylinder. Mixed waste will be segregated first and biodegradable waste material, like stale or unused cooked food, vegetable waste, cattle dung, fruit peels and rotten fruits will be used in the plant. 
 
 The produced biogas will get stored in a balloon and it will be supplied to the kitchen as per requirements. 
 
 Bhakar said, “A major ad- vantage of the plant is that the system of garbage handling will improve and waste segre- gation norms laid down by the civic body will be followed.”
