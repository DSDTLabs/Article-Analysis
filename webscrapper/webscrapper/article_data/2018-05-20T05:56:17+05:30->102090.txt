PANAJI: Slamming the state electricity department for its failure to prevent damage to power infrastructure, the Aam Aadmi Party on Saturday said the common man in Goa was facing one of the worst power outages during the summer.

 “With the chief minister away on treatment, many from the government, including the officers, are holidaying abroad, leaving the people of the state to sweat it out during the hottest time of the year,”   convener Elvis Gomes told reporters. 
 
 The party also castigated the BJP-led coalition for neglecting safety norms, which had led to the death of several linesmen from the department. Gomes also questioned the government for the inflated power bills consumers were receiving. 
 
 AAP general secretary  , on his part, lashed out at the state tourism department for investing crores of rupees in public toilets for tourists even as local residents in many areas remained without adequate sanitation facilities.
