 The band mostly plays commercial and regional music. However, based on the individual interest of each member, there are lots of elements of pop,   and indie in the band’s music.
 
 
 
 Roulette is influenced by a lot of local artistes and bands, such as Peepal Tree, Perfect Stranger, In The Now and Bryden- Parth.

 Though they will be playing in Kerala soon, the band hopes to play for more social events like corporate shows, fests parties and such. “Each of us are branching out into playback  , teaching and composing music. As a band, we also look forward to collaborate with other artistes,” says Vani.
