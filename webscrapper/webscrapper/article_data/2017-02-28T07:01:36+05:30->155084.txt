VADODARA: The   (BCCI) may receive two separate reports about Baroda Cricket Association’s (BCA) status on Lodha Committee’s recommendations. The   said on Monday that they will be preparing a separate report that will be sent to Vinod Rai who is heading four-member panel that is administrating the BCCI. 

 The BCA management dominated by Revival Group has summoned a managing committee meeting on Tuesday to prepare a status report about Lodha Committee’s recommendations. 
 
 The report about compliance along with affidavits from the office-bearers has to be sent to the BCCI by Wednesday evening. Managing committee member and Royal Group member,   said, “We will prepare a separate report about eligibility of the office-bearers and send it to BCCI as the Revival Group members in the committee may not send a proper report. We have not been even informed about the agenda that will be taken up in the meeting on Tuesday.”
 
 Vakil further said that even the managing committee meeting is unconstitutional and there is no need to call a meet for the status report. “How can the unelected secretaries call a meeting? Also, the two-year term of the co-opted members is over and hence they can’t take any decision. As such the SC order about eligibility is clear so there was no need to summon a meeting for it. We will boycott it,” Vakil told TOI.
 
 “The managing committee members are governing members as per the BCA constitution and admission of the Revival Group members. Hence the rule of 70 years as well as maximum nine-year term will also be applicable to them. Apart from me, only Abhay Palkar, Ajit Lele, Ravi Deshmukh and Kamal Pandya are qualified and rest all will be disqualified,” Vakil claimed.
