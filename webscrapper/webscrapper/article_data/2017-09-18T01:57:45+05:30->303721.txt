NEW DELHI: A group of   were on strike on Sunday in south Delhi and did not pick up garbage even though the civic bodies conducted special   drives to mark the birthday of PM Narendra Modi. They protested against the beating of a sanitation worker in Chattarpur allegedly by a BJP councillor three days ago.

 Rajendra Mewati, general secretary of United Front of MCD Employees Associations, said the strike has been going on for the past two days. “The strike will continue on Monday as well,” he said.   mayor Kamaljeet Sherawat, however, denied that any strike was going on. “The sanitation workers worked even on Sunday for special sanitation drives,” she said.
