Visakhapatnam: The police department has set up a social media monitoring cell where people can post their grievances and complaints regarding cyber bullying as well as false and baseless postings. Such cells are already functional in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Bhopal.

 Apart from the WhatsApp number 9493336633, Facebook page, and twitter account, the social media monitoring cell will function 24/7. It will have six police personnel who will work on different shifts.
 
 “As majority of the youth are tech-savvy and spends most of their time on social media, we thought that it is important to prevent unrest incited by provoking posts. This full-time cell will ensure that any post that is suspected to cause trouble is addressed immediately,” city deputy commissioner of police (law and order) K Phakkerappa told TOI.
 
 “Your Facebook posts, tweets, blog posts and other social media presence will be monitored by the police, who can if necessary will take action against the person responsible for the posts,” a police source explained.
 
 Meanwhile, the DCP said that the initiative was appreciated by many people on Tuesday in Twitter. “People can report small offences in their surroundings, upload images or videos. We will also take complaints and grievances through social media. However, traditional policing will continue. People can call the cops by dialling 100 or reach out through I-klick or contact officers at the stations directly,” he elaborated.
 
 The cops will also focus on fake accounts created by individuals with an aim to harass women. “Our aim is to bridge the gap between public’s expectations and delivery of police services as well as maintain public order,” police commissioner T Yoganand told TOI.
