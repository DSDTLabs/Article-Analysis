The 65th birthday celebrations of DMK working president M K   at the party headquarters,  , on Thursday had all the elements of a mela or a jamboree. Enthusiastic leaders and workers vied with one another to present Stalin with a variety of offerings from goats to books and even garlands and bouquets of currency notes.

 This once-a-year celebration, earlier reserved for party chief M   on his birthday on June 3, has been seamlessly transferred to Stalin, especially after the DMK patriarch became inactive and confined to his Gopalapuram residence.
 Though Stalin initiated this celebration process at Arivalayam last year, the enthusiasm was much more palpable this year.
 
 “This is our way of showing love and affection to our working president, who has been working tirelessly for the party, more so in the absence of Thalaivar,” said Jayakumar, a worker from north Chennai.
 
 Stalin started his day with the formal laying of wreaths at the memorials of C N Annadurai and Periyar, before arriving at Arivalayam, where functionaries had lined up since morning. Congress leaders Mukul Wasnik, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and actors Rajinikant and Sathyaraj greeted Stalin over phone.   president   chose Twitter to greet the DMK leader.
 
 Political analyst M   attributed the greater enthusiasm on display to Stalin’s recent district level interactions with partymen. “Stalin’s recent interactions with even the low level office-bearers of the party seem to have given the much-needed rejuvenation. Also, expectations of imminent elections in the state acted as a catalyst,” said Kasinathan.
