NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) has announced central contracts for India players but the national selectors have been left in the lurch. The national selection committee comprising  , Devang Gandhi and Sarandeep Singh haven’t received their renewed contracts with the Indian cricket board ( ) even five months after the completion of their one-year stint.

 
 
 
 TOI understands that the contracts handed out by the BCCI are subject to renewal at the board’s annual general meeting (AGM). Since the board failed to call its AGM last year, there has been no progress in this matter.
 
 “Even the players’ contracts were supposed to be passed by the general body. If the players’ needs are important and the rules were bent for them, then why not for the people who select them? It’s unfair that the selectors are kept waiting,” a BCCI official told TOI.
 
 
 
 “There are more pressing issues regarding the selection panel. The board is still paying Jatin Paranjpe and   even after their services were not required, since Lodha recommendations trimmed the panel from five to three. There is a common belief that there is a need for five selectors. Even chairman of selectors Prasad had asked for a raise. These things need to be addressed,” the official said.
 
 
 
 With Venkatesh Prasad resigning from his post of the chairman of the junior selection committee, it is likely that his colleague Gyanendra Pandey is going to step up and that take that post. It is also learnt that a candidate from the south zone will fill the vacancy. According to sources, names of   and Subramanium Badrinath are doing the rounds for the post.
