HYDERABAD: Frequent drug raids in gated communities in the IT hub has triggered concern among software professionals and residents. Friday's raid at Malaysian Township in which five persons, including an IBM woman techie, was apprehended for smoking ganja (marijuana) has sent ripples.

 Many users of the contraband, considered the 'least dangerous' recreational drug, pointed out how even as police were cracking down on ganja trade, other illicit drugs were still easily available.
 
 “Narcotics rings thrive clandestinely in the city and instead of focusing on dangerous and addictive drugs such as LSD, heroine and meth that are freely circulating, police are out to nab people for smoking ganja in privacy of their homes. A major source of more dangerous drugs is the deepweb and the state narcotics wing has not yet figured out how to curb the dealings. Most items are bought in bulk on Darknet for competitive pricing. Psychedelic drugs like DMT (N-Dimethyltryptamine) is easily available in city,“ pointed out Zaher Ahmed, who works with an MNC at Madhapur. “Ongoing drug raids and arrest of peddlers have not eliminated marijuana from Hyderabad's streets. People now travel as far as Zaheerabad and Lambasingi (Visakhapatnam, AP) to procure marijuana.This is then distributed among a close network of friends,“ explained techie Charan S.
 
 According to DCP (Madhapur), Vishwa Prasad, the number of people getting into the drug trade has also gone up in the IT hub. “The reason could be easy money. People are procuring weed at a cheap price and distributing it at much higher prices. Unlike earlier, where working professionals depended on solely peddlers, many of them are now themselves getting into the drug trade. Huge quantities of ganja from AP also makes its way to Mumbai,“ said Prasad.
