MUMBAI: Even as the   announced that it would credit Rs 5,000 to the account of pregnant women who are below the poverty line, it has slashed the budget allocation for the health insurance scheme for the poor by over 50%.

 On Friday,   finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar announced Rs 576 crore for the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Aarogya Abhiyan in 2018-19 as against last budget’s outlay of Rs1,316 crore.
 
 There was speculation that the state’s health scheme has suffered due to the focus on farmer’s loan waiver scheme and revised salaries as per the seventh pay commission, a closer look at the state’s revenue documents showed a different reason. The state Economic Survey released on Thursday showed that the state had only spent Rs 529 crore on the arogya scheme up to December 2017. The expenditure on the scheme was Rs 643 crore in 2016-2017 despite higher allocations. NCP leader and former finance minister Jayant Patil slammed government and its budget allocation said, “The government has cut short provisions in many sectors.”
 
 Mungantiwar conceded, “Both the loan waiver scheme and seventh pay commission are not an every year allocation, but still we will manage. Maharashtra spends the highest amount on social sector among all other states.” 
 
 This year, he has announced Rs 964 crore for the National Health Mission as well as Rs 65 crore for one-time payment to pregnant women. A multi-speciality hospital will come up in Sindhudurg with an investment of about Rs 20 crore.
