MUMBAI: The state-appointed committee probing incidents of exploitation in ashram schools unearthed that 29 tribal girls were sexually abused between January 2011 and March 2016. 

 However, activists said the actual cases were much more than reported ones. Most of the incidents are from Nashik, Amravati, Nagpur and Thane divisions. 
 
 The findings revealed that many lower-rung employees and some senior staffers like superintendents and principals of the ashram schools were involved in exploiting minors.
 
 “These are only reported cases and could be just the tip of the iceberg. Some cases may have been scuttled by paying off bribes or threatening victims. Many poor tribal families do not venture to come forward and complain,” said Kavita Ware, who works for an NGO engaged in tribal development. 
 
 “The government has formed committees in districts. However, they never submitted any report to the  . Whenever we ask them about the report, we receive the standard answer that the work is in progress,” she added. Shiv Sena MLC Neelam Gorhe, a member of the state-appointed committee, said many cases may have gone unreported. “The government should form monitoring committees, comprising comprising villagers and local NGO activists for each of the ashram schools,” said Gorhe. 
 
 Tribal development minister Vishnu Savra did not take TOI calls to answer queries.
