BHUBANESWAR: Union petroleum minister Dharmendra   on Wednesday urged the state government to be more responsible towards finding a solution to the ongoing teachers' agitation through dialogue. 

 In a series of tweets, the Union minister said the agitating teachers have boycotted the plus two evaluation process. This has triggered a sense of fear and apprehension in the minds of the students, Pradhan said. 
 
 Since the issue is linked to the future of   students and the issue of teachers' protest is not new, the Union minister said the state government should go for a dialogue to put an end to the crisis at the earliest.
