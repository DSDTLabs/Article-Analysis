VADODARA: A tug-of-war for the 15 seats of government nominees in   has started between   of the campus. The ‘sankalan samiti’ of the   which comprises of the members from the BJP, the RSS, ABVP and the teacher’s outfit - Maharaja Sayajirao Vishvavidyalay Shaikshik Sangh is yet to meet and discuss names of probable candidates whom the state government can consider as government nominees. 

 Usually, it is based on the recommendations of the ‘sankalan samiti’ that government nominees are appointed in the senate body. But the rival saffron group comprising of rebels has already submitted some names for the post of government nominees. Sources said that the rival group has submitted five names to the state government through MSU vice-chancellor professor Parimal Vyas on Saturday. 
 
 It would be worth watching whether the BJP-ruled state government and state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama considers the names recommended by the parivar channelized through the   samiti or those recommended by the rebel saffron group.
