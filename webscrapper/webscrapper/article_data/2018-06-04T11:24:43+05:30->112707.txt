Singer   announced recently not just one, but two exciting Tollywood song releases of hers on social media.

  The first release she shared is ‘Andamaina Chandamama’ from Karunakaran,   and Anupama Parameswaran’s ‘Tej I Love You’. With music by Gopi Sundar and lyrics by Sahithi, the song also features vocals by Haricharan. With the lyrical video trending at #26 on YouTube at the time of writing, the peppy romantic number has received good response from fans. The song has raked in more than 408k views in the two days since its release. 
 
  Talking about her lesser-known second release, Chinmayi wrote on social media, “I have had 2   release in the past couple of days. Here is my song from   for Srinivasa Sarma :)” (sic) The beautiful romantic number called ‘Kougillalo’ from the indie film ‘Ala’ has music composed by Srinivasa Sarma with lyrics by Sirasri. Featuring vocals of Chinmayi, the film directed by Sarat Palanki is all set to feature Bhargav Kommera, Shilpika, Malvika,   and more in the lead. The number that has received comparatively lesser views seems reminiscent of ‘Paruvam Vaanaga’ from ‘Roja’ in parts and is being called ‘mesmerising’ by fans.
