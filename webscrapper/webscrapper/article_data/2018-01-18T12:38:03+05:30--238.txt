CHANDIGARH: Panjab   is considering letting candidates seeking admissions submit all supporting documents and forms online for the upcoming   season, sources said. 

 Last year, the university made the process of admissions online but faced difficulties in the admission season. Despite introducing cloud-based online admission system last year, the varsity had to ask students to submit hard copies of forms and documents. This was discussed in a meeting of the admission committee chaired by the dean, university instructions,   on Tuesday.
 
 The online system for admissions was introduced in 2017. To reduce the risk of mistakes, applicants were asked to submit hard copies of documents to match data to prevent any deviation. Sources said it was pointed out in the meeting that there is no advantage of having an online system if hard copies of documents are to be submitted. 
 
 Sources also said students frequently get their forms filled in cyber cafes, where wrong data is often entered. It was discussed that the admission schedule should include days for candidates to rectify these mistakes. The University automated the admission process completely with the support of cloud services and online payment gateway. Candidates seeking admissions were given a login id and password. 
 
 Last year, since the admission process was online, the University created 54 help centres across   in affiliated colleges and set up four help desks on campus. However, the University faced difficulties and made it mandatory to submit hard copies of documents.
