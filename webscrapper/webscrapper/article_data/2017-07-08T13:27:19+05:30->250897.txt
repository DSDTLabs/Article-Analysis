COIMBATORE: Thursday’s   that claimed a life and caused serious injuries to two persons happened because there was no pedestrian crossing set-up. This is the case across the   are either   or are not regulated with signals. 

 Pedestrian crossings should be set up at junctions, allowing pedestrians to cross comfortably. In some junctions, the pedestrian crossing is right after the stop line. So pedestrians have to cross a road up to the centre median, walk down to the signal and then cross the other half. In such a situation, they are vulnerable to getting knocked down by motorists.
 
 According to the   and Development Policy (ITDP), a pedestrian crossing should be set up at the traffic signal junctions. “The problem with Avinashi Road is that the stretch within the city is designed like a national highway. As per guidelines, pedestrian crossings should be set up at every 80-150m on commercial stretches. On residential stretches, the pedestrian crossings are set up every 150m,” said the manager, programmes (TN) and communications, ITDP, Aswathy Dilip. 
 
 Also, critical locations on the stretch should be facilitated with signals for pedestrian crossings. The signals should be for 20-30 seconds. 
 
 In Coimbatore, nearly half the population commutes on foot and public transport. “About 30% of the people walk and another 20-30% use public transport,” said Aswathy. “Most of the walking population is from the economically weaker section. This is why it is essential for the pedestrian crossings to be on the road level. Setting up subways or footover bridges are not a solution,” said Aswathy. “At the same time, using a footover bridge or a subway with bags or children in hand will be difficult,” she added.
