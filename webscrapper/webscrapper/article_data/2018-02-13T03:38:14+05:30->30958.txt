 Vendors in Pali Market, Bandra, continued to charge Rs 30 to Rs 35 per kg. Matunga, too, was Rs 30. Gopal Gupta, a  , claimed he was unaware of the rates in  , where wholesale prices are said to have crashed, but said he paid Rs 15 in Vashi for “best quality” tomatoes. “Our customers scarcely ask prices. They only want superior quality items,” he said.
 
 Wholesale trader J M Soni of Rishabh Traders said: “We procure tomato directly from growing areas like Nashik, and indeed rates are Rs 4-6 per kilo.

Farmers may not be happy, but this is cyclical. Consumers are very pleased to get reasonably priced tomatoes.”
