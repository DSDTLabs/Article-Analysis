The promos are out and the excitement is back on. Die hard fans of Srujan Lokesh’s hit comedy show have reason to be happy, as the actor-host is set to herald   back on your   screens. In fact, when the show went on a hiatus in October, Srujan had categorically stated that he would not break up a winning formula and that they would be back with a bang. And true to his word, he is bringing it back with small changes in the format of the show.
 “Majaa Talkies is set to get a new flavour, with some new characters and some changes in the format. For instance, there is going to be a lot more audience interaction going forward. In fact, we are looking at inviting people from across the world to send us videos of their questions, which will be aired,” says Srujan. But wouldn’t that take the sheen off and make it more like a talk show? “No, audience interaction will also have to have a dash of humour to ensure the flow of the show is not interrupted,” he explains.
  The team, adds Srujan, has not been idling in the past few months, even while he took up judging duty on another comedy show. “Since Majaa Talkies went off air, we have been busy planning our strategy for our return. Over the years, we have felt the pulse of the audience and we know what they expect of us. We will serve them just that, from a new set with a few new faces joining the narrative, for which auditions are on. Of course, show regulars will all be there, albeit not as frequently as earlier, as some of them are busy with other commitments. We are looking at bringing in a big twist in the very first episode of the return,” says Srujan.
