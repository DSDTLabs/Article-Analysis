PANAJI : The next 18-24 months could be hard on property brokers and consultants as the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) sweeps through the state. Decisions of the  , which are expected to favour the consumer, could also weigh on realtors, said industry experts.

 Speaking at a seminar on RERA organised by the  , chartered accountants and realtors warned that under RERA, failure to deliver an apartment or plot as promised would lead to litigation and heavy penalties. “Don’t make false commitments and avoid unfair trade practices,” RERA compliance auditor and chartered accountant   said.
 
 
  
 
 The RERA regulations for Goa were notified in early December and a registration portal for realtors and builders was launched in mid-January. “Keep your communication clear, verifiable and in writing as much as is possible,” said founder and CEO of   Alan Viegas.
 
 “We have a habit of using flowery language but now we must tone down. These first two years of the implementation of the act are going to be a testing time.”
 
 According to the National Association of Realtors, India (NAR), around 75% of total brokers may close down business in the next three years. Director of Escala Realty, Amit Chopra, concurred with the apprehensions of realtors, and said that real estate consultants and brokers have to get into the habit of signing contracts with consumers and builders to remain relevant.
 
 “RERA and the court will be stern to make sure that the customer is protected, so realtors should avoid oral promises,” Chopra said.
 
 Given that some brokers are toying with the idea of skipping RERA registration, Sabadra urged all brokers and property consultants to avoid cutting corners and to remain RERA compliant. “ Building and marketing of projects without registration is asking for big trouble,” said Viegas.
