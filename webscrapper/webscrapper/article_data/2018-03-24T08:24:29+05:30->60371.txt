AHMEDABAD: As March 24 is World Tuberculosis Day, the   figures show a need for introspection, as the state reported a 57% increase in TB cases in four years. Gujarat, which had 93,074 cases of TB in 2014, reported 1,46,004 in 2017, including 39,592 cases reported at private hospitals.

 According to the figures from the state health department, 47.3 lakh people in high-risk groups were screened and a further 1,862 cases were discovered in a house-to-house survey conducted in 2017.
 
 
  
 
 According to the Global TB Report 2017, incidence of TB per lakh people per year decreased in India from 217 in 2015 to 211 in 2016. Gujarat, however, is different and is worse off than the national scenario in the same period. TB incidence per lakh people per year increased from 182 in 2015 to 210 in 2016. In 2017, incidence increased further to 242.
 
 A statement from the health department claimed, “The health department of the government of Gujarat is proactive in implementing innovative strategies and expanding free molecular (cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test, CBNAAT) diagnosis and free daily regimen treatment services to patients seeking care in the private sector.”
 
 “Gujarat has begun a daily regimen for all drug sensitive tuberculosis patients since October 2, 2017, according to the recommendation of the ministry of health and family welfare. More than 40,000 TB cases have already been put on the daily regimen by now,” it added.
 
 Dr  , health commissioner, said, “Gujarat is doing extremely well on TB as our success rate is perhaps the best among the largest states of India. Our position is second in curbing the disease after   but their magnitude of cases is much less than us.”
 
 “We will also take proper care of nutrition for patients irrespective of financial background. So all TB patients will be given Rs 500 per month till treatment completion for nutrition support and out of pocket expenditure for 2018 and 2019, as decided by the government of India,” added Ravi.
 
 The high incidence of TB can be attributed to various social determinants which perpetuate the spread of TB infection. These social determinant factors like poverty, under nutrition, crowded and poorly ventilated living, alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking increase the likelihood of conversion of TB infection to TB disease.
