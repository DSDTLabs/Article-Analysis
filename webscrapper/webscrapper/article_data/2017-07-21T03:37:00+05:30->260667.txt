Porvorim: Reminding the government that it had said it would appoint a consultant for development of three cities in the state, former chief minister and Margao MLA Digambar Kamat urged the the government to immediately appoint a consultant for two cities as a consultant has already been appointed for Panaji. Pointing out to the bad state of affairs at Hospicio in Margao, Kamat urged the government to take up, on priority, the completion of the district hospital at Margao. Speaking on the health sector during the general discussion on the budget, Kamat said that patients’ relatives are being asked to get medicines from outside most of the government-run hospitals. He said when the government is spending huge amounts of money to buy and supply medicines to patients, then why was there a shortage in medicines. “Government should fix accountability,” he added. Kamat urged the government to set up an ultra-modern bus terminal at Margao on land admeasuring 60,000 sqm, which will help Kadamba transport corporation (KTC) to run its operations without financial help from the government. He also said that Konkan railway corporation is expanding and it is putting up a fourth platform on the Aquem side of the railway station. He said that the government should complete the master plan immediately so that people entering the railway station do not face hardships. Replying to Kamat, chief minister Manohar Parrikar said that the action taken report is being prepared and it will be presented in the assembly next week. While stating that he was the first to table the ‘action taken report’ of the previous budget, Parrikar said that he could not table the report due to the code of conduct for the panchayat elections. Kamat pointed out that this budget does not have an ‘action taken report’ which helps members to understand how many schemes announced in the budget have not been implemented by the state government.
