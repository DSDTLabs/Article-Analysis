Panaji: Six notices moved by various legislators seeking to install   of leaders, including Jack  , will not be taken up for discussion during the upcoming budget session on Monday, as speaker Pramod Sawant has not included them in the business for the almost month-long budget session. 

 At present, only a statue of Goa’s first chief minister Dayanand Bandodkar has been installed in the   complex. 
 
 Sources said that Sawant will explain to members of the House the reason for not including the private members’ notices in the businnes of the House.
 
 Notices had been given for six private members’ resolutions before the assembly to install statues in the assembly complex. 
 
 BJP’s Calangute MLA and deputy speaker Michael Lobo had given notice for moving a private member’s resolution to install a statue of Sequeira, who is considered the ‘Father of the Opinion Poll’. A similar notice was moved by NCP’s Benaulim MLA Churchill Alemao and the   to install Sequeira’s statue.
 
 BJP Bicholim MLA Rajesh Patnekar moved a notice for private member’s resolution to install a statue of Maratha king Shivaji Maharaj and MGP’s Savordem MLA Deepak Prabhu Pauskar served a notice to move two separate private member’s resolutions to install statues of freedom fighters Ram Manohar Lohia and T B Cunha.
 
 The controversy started after town and country planning minister Vijai Sardesai demanded on the eve of   Day that a statue of Sequeira should be install in the assembly complex. He was later backed by Lobo.
 
 To counter the demands of Sardesai and Lobo, BJP unanimously passed a resolution that it does not support the demand of installing any new statues at the assembly complex. Later MGP passed a resolution that they will move a private member’s resolution to install statue’s of Lohia and Cunha in the assembly complex.
