LUCKNOW: It was high-octane drama as rape accused BJP   Kuldeep Singh Sengar reached   headquarters in Lucknow in a white Ambassador car on Friday. 

 Sengar was booked by UP Police on Thursday following nationwide furore over rape allegations on him by a 17-year-old in Unnao.
 
 As a CBI inspector held Sengar by his wrist and politely ejected him out of the car, he smiled at photographers while repeatedly saying that he had come on his own.
 
  "Chinta mat karo, chinta mat karo. Main khud aaya hoon, adhikariyon se pooch lo (Don't worry. I have come on my own. You can ask the officials," he said, speaking to reporters outside the CBI headquarters. 
 
 Sengar had earlier maintained that he would not surrender to the police as there was no evidence of rape against him and the allegations were fabricated. 
 
 He had also alleged that the girl was tutored to level rape allegations against him, following their village rivalry and dispute over Unnao police dropping names of two women from the chargesheet over the girl's abduction and subsequent rape.
 
  While his family admitted that they had earlier planned to visit   temple in Varanasi, they said Sengar received a phone call from Lucknow police that his presence in the state capital was required.
