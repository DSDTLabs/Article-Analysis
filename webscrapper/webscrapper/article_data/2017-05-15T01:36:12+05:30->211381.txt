NAVI MUMBAI: Over 800   employees have been called for election duty during the Panvel municipal polls. 

 Admitting that this was a leading to a staff crunch, additional municipal commissioner   said, “Almost every staff of NMMC is reporting for the Panvel election. This has indeed posed problems for conducting day-to -day activities of the administration like nullah cleaning.”
 
 The   called for   duty include clerks, engineers and civic officials from other departments. The list also includes more than 200 teaching staffers. 
 
 “Few teachers were served with notices for failing to report for the training session that was held on May 7,” an official said. 
 
 The Panvel civic elections are scheduled to be held on May 24 and the results will be declared on May 26. NMMC officials will be working for smooth conduct of the polls.
