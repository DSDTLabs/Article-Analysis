Navi Mumbai: In eight months since the launch of an   grievance redressal system,   has received as many as 5,043   from residents with the maximum coming to the encroachment department (1,490 till June 1). 

 The system has identified 150 civic issues related to the 23 departments of the civic body. 
 
 Municipal commissioner   had recently sought analytical data of the system. “The integrated mobile application and portal grievance system has been initiated so that residents can have access to real-time redressal of civic issues at the click of a button. A review was necessary to ensure the system was indeed functioning as envisioned,” the civic chief said.
 
  More than 61% grievances were addressed in 7 days and 47% of the complainants gave an overall satisfactory feedback. Around 23% complaints were escalated and the average time taken for resolving was 5 days and 18 hours. 
 
 “The mechanism is such that if the grievance is not addressed within 24 hours or not resolved in 7 days by the concerned department it automatically gets escalated to a higher authority which brings in accountability among the lower-level officers,” said additional municipal commissioner Ankush Chavan. 
 
 Civic officials have been asked to submit photographic evidence of action being taken to reduce poor feedback from residents.
