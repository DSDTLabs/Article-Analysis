CHENNAI: A day after increasing the bus fare, the state government was compelled to spell out the reasons for the move. Transport minister M R   ruled out the possibility of a rollback, terming the decision essential. Municipal administration minister S P Velumani said the government increased the   to provide employees pending benefits. 

 Senior ministers fanned out across the state explaining that the government had no other option to tackle the financial crunch. 
 
 “There’s no chance of rolling back the fare hike,” said Vijayabhaskar while speaking to reporters at   on Saturday. 
 
 In  , power minister P   said, “It is only to tackle the money deficit in the transport department, we had to increase the fare. People must pardon us and cooperate with the government.” 
 
 Velumani blamed the   and its affiliated trade union   for the hike. “DMK started the practice of using employees’ money and recently LPF created a problem for the government in the form of bus strike. It is only to repay the money to employees, we had to do it,” said Velumani in Coimbatore. 
 
 In Madurai, cooperative minister   said, “The people’s living standards have gone up. They will not mind paying a rupee or more for this. It is only the opposition parties which will try to do politics in this. Even when you throw a rupee at a beggar, he will give you a dirty look as if it’s peanuts. So, the present fare hike is not very big.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the transport department MD has asked all drivers and conductors not to argue with passengers on the fare hike, rather explain to them the reasons for the increase. 
 
 “The bus fare has been increased only due to financial crunch faced by the transport department,” said a department release.
