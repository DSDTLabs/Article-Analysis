VADODARA: A woman has accused her estranged husband of forging her signature on a cheque to make payment of his car’s service.

 Police said that the complainant Puja Patel learnt in December last year about the forgery when she received a message that a cheque of Rs 10,000 had bounced due to difference in signature. 
 
 Patel, who now lives in New Delhi, then inquired with the bank as she had not issued any cheque. The bank officials informed her that a payment of Rs 10,000 was made to DC Car Wash in Vadodara. But since there was a difference in the signature, the cheque was returned.
 
 Patel then approached the service station owner Bhaskar   to know who had given him the cheque. Pandya told her that her husband   had given the cheque as payment for his car service. She then learnt that Pratik had given several cheques of her bank account to others as well.
 
 When Patel had moved to New Delhi in March last year after separating from Pratik, she had left her luggage and bank passbook and cheque book at Pratik’s house at Bil near the city. 
 
 Based on Patel’s complaint,   police booked Pratik on Saturday for cheating and criminal breach of trust.
