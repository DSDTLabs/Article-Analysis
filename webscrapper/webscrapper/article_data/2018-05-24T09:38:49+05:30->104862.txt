 “We were informed on Wednesday morning by the management of Karni Vikas Samiti’s shelter home about the incident, all about 12 to 15 years old belonging to the Northeast,” Child Welfare Committee (CWC) chairman   said. “The incident came to light when the four kids were not found with the other kids in the room of shelter home where they had been sent for sleep last night,” he added. The CWC chairman alleged superintendent of police, Kota city on the same day of the children’s rescue from orphanage on May 19 was, through an email, asked to put in place the safety and security measures for the kids in shelter home but it was not treated as seriously.
 
 “It is suspected that the escape of the four kids was pre planned as their family members had reached Kota yesterday and they submitted memorandum to Kota district collector at noon against the action carried out by CWC to free the 70 kids from Emmanuel society’s orphanage,” the CWC chairman said.
 
 Gumanpura station police also showed insensitivity in the matter as they have not lodged the matter so far while they should have lodged the matter, as per the model rules, immediately after it was reported to them, he further alleged.
 
 When contacted, Gumanpura station police admitted to have received the information about the escape from   shelter home but said they have not received a report in the matter from shelter home management. “We have asked the shelter home management to submit a report in the matter and we are waiting for their arrival,” a police personnel at Gumanpura police station said adding no report in this connection has been lodged so far.
