Ranchi: Police have arrested two persons recently and an FIR registered on Monday in connection with the gang   of   girl (14) near Murum village under the Kanke police station area on April 28. 

 The survivor was returning home from a marriage party along with her friends when she was whisked away on a motorcycle by three persons.
 
 According to the police, a group of girls and boys were returning from a marriage that had taken place in a neighboring village, when 10 to 15 criminals started following them. As the criminals surrounded them, the boys and girls fled to save themselves. A fight also broke out between the group and the criminals. Meanwhile, three men came to the spot on a bike and forcibly took the girl away to a nearby field and committed the crime.
 
 Ranchi SP (Rural) Ajit Peter Dungdung confirmed that the two persons have been arrested in connection with the case and that an investigation was underway.
 
 The FIR in connection was registered on Monday as the parents did not want to come out in the open fearing social stigma. Police said a medical examination of the survivor is being carried out in connection with the crime. The girls statement would be recorded before a magistrate, they said.
 
 “We have arrested two accused who belonged to the village where the marriage took place. We are trying to verify the age certificate of the accused to ascertain whether they are minor or not,” the officer-in-charge of Kanke police station said.
