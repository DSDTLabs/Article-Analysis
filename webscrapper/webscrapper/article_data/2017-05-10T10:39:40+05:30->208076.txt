BENGALURU: Morning walkers on Tuesday were shocked to see scores of silver oak trees missing from   Main Road.Twigs and branches of the trees were scattered on the footpath.

 Around 30 silver oak trees were chopped near Sapthagiri Engineering College. Locals alleged a contractor associated with Kar nataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited ( ) may be responsible for the act.
 
 “If the trees were a threat to the power line nearby, they could have just pruned some branches. Felling the entire tree line is not done,“ said a resident on condition of anonymity.
 
 Officials with the forest cell of BBMP, whose permission is a must to cut any tree in the city, were unaware of the act. Vijay Kumar, assistant conservator of forests, BBMP, told  , “I don't know who is behind this. I will try to get more knowledge on the issue.“
 
 Subash Shetty, another resident, said, “Felling of trees is not acceptable in a city which is already facing loss of green cover. Cutting 30 trees on Hesaraghatta road, which is home to many colleges and schools, is disastrous. Not many years ago, the neighbourhood was lush and beautiful. But now it is a miserable patch of barren land.“
