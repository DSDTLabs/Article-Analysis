AHMEDABAD: On Thursday morning, a scooterist stopped by the   canal at the   canal crossing, pulled out a plastic bag full of garbage and threw it into the canal. 

 This unlucky man’s offence came just when AMC’s director of solid waste management, Harshad  , was on his morning rounds. 
 
 Solanki stopped the man just as he was about to zoom off and asked why he threw the garbage bag into the canal. The man shouted back, “Who are you to ask?” 
 
 The next 25 minutes became a public spectacle. “Get into the canal, pick up your rubbish and put it in the bin provided here, right now,” Solanki insisted. 
 
 He then gave the litterbug three options — go to jail for six months, pay a Rs 5,000 fine or get into the canal and retrieve the plastic bag. As pressure from the public grew, the man descended into the canal with help from a sanitation worker, walked through ankle-deep sewage in the canal and picked up the garbage bag. Solanki fumed when the culprit offered the sanitation worker a Rs 200 bribe to climb into the canal to pick up the garbage on behalf of him. Solanki forced the culprit to get down into the canal, guided by the sanitation worker, and pick up the bag. 
 
  “We removed 30,000 tonnes of waste from the canal and spent crores on men, labour and machines. It hurts when citizens don’t pay any heed to these efforts,” says Solanki.
