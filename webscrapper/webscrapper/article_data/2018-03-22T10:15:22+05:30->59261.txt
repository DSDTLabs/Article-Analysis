HYDERABAD: Rejecting the BJP’s charges that detailed project reports (DPR) have not been prepared for several projects, irrigation minister T Harish Rao said the TRS government is following transparency by scrapping dubious practices like disbursal of mobilisation advance and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) mode that were followed by the previous Congress governments.

 Speaking in the Legislative Assembly on Wednesday, the minister said the government has not taken up any new projects, but only redesigned some of the old projects to increase the ayacut. “The redesigning of Kaleshwaram has resulted in the ayacut going up from 16 lakh acres to 37 lakh acres. This cannot be construed as a new project,” he explained. Three major irrigation projects are under construction on river Godavari and once ready, they will change the face of  , he said.
 
 When members referred to the Kanthanapally and   lift irrigation projects, Harish said both the projects are kept on hold as the government is working out a new plan to reduce submergence.
 
 Harish Rao vowed to complete all the pending projects, particularly those in   district.
 
 In an emotional tone, the minister said that Telangana should provide food to the entire country.
 
 Responding to   leader G Kishan Reddy’s charges that some projects are unduly delayed, the minister said the projects planned on the Krishna are awaiting fund allocations from the Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal.
 
 He promised the members that the redesigned Dummugudem project will cater to the needs of   district. In order to save the heritage Ramappa temple in  , the Devadula project is being redesigned, the minister added.
