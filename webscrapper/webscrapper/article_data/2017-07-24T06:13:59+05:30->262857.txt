BENGALURU:   activists led by writer Chandrashekar Patil and actor-activist Prakash Belawadi on Sunday warned chief minister Siddaramaiah that if his government continued to impose Hindi on   trains and stations, they will launch an agitation, including jail bharo. 

 Patil said it is unfortunate that police booked protesters, who had blackened Hindi nameboards at the   station, under differe nt sections of the Indian Penal Code including 153A. Seven Karnataka Rakshana Vedike activists were arrested on July 20 for allegedly defacing Hindi words on boards outside this station. 
 
 Patil and Belawadi were speaking at a press conference called by Kannada activists to protest against police invoking IPC sections that were not only irrelevant but also made it difficult for activists to avail bail.
 
 Section 153A is about 'promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residen ce, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony'. Police also booked protesters under Sections 143 (members of unlawful assembly) and 427 (mischeivous act ending in loss or damage of property). 
 
 "Imposing Section 153A gives the impression that police wanted to curb these agitations strongly. The protest was non-violent in nature and police action is more than what was warranted," Patil said, adding, "Are there different sects like Kannada speaking and non-Kannada speaking in our society?"
 
  Belawadi said equity should be maintained everywhere. "Police have treated these Kannada activists like miscreants participating in communal violence. Letters to the central government from the state secretaries have said there is no need to use Hindi on   and   officials have also agreed saying only Kannada and English are suffi cient. Why is the Central government still imposing Hindi?" Belawadi said.
