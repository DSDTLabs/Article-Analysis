PANAJI:   SC will write to the All India   Federation (AIFF) to post foreign referee for their crucial concluding   clash against Minerva Punjab FC on March 8.
 
  Churchill, Goa’s only representative in the I-League, were furious after referee Om Prakash Thakur disallowed Churchill’s opening goal against   scored by Osagie Monday in the 34th minute. The referee blew his whistle for Onyeama Francis Okechukwu’s ‘foul’ inside a crowded goal, but club owner   said the goal was as clear as daylight.
  
  The Goan side needed a win from their last two matches and they believed they had done everything right against the former champions.
  
  “The referee made a mess of everything. How can that goal be disallowed? Whether you look at the goal from the ground or on television, there is no way that goal can be disallowed. It’s legitimate goal; there was no foul at all,” said Alemao after his team succumbed to the might of Mohun Bagan 1-2 at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Saturday.
  
  Churchill’s last chance to save relegation is in their last match against Minerva Punjab FC, who are leading the league table and are best placed to emerge champions.
  
  “We cannot trust Indian referees anymore. The AIFF must appoint foreign referees for such an important clash. They would have seen the officiating,” said Alemao.
  
  Indian referees have come under severe criticism this season both in the I-League and Indian Super League (ISL) with reports suggesting that AIFF’s director of referees will be asked to resign at the end of the season.
