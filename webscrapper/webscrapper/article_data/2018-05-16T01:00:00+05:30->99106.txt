Posting a romantic picture with your best friend and giving it a poetic caption might not be a good idea, especially if you don’t want people to start speculating about a romantic affair. 

 That’s exactly what happened to TV actor  , who recently posted a picture with his bestie   on his social media account. While the pic had the two looking into each other’s eyes, the caption was even more misleading. It read: “Look into my eyes and hear what I am not saying, for my eyes speak louder than my voice ever will.”
 
 The moment he posted the picture,   was flooded with congratulatory messages on his social media page, with people wishing him “everlasting love and togetherness” with Akanksha. The actor also received numerous phone calls following which he removed the picture. 
 
 The duo, meanwhile, denies being in a relationship.   who is currently playing the lead in ' ', says, “Rohit is a crazy guy. He does many fun things when I party with him, this photograph was one of them. It is true that I like him a lot and we party together, but there is nothing happening between us. Also, if I enter into a relationship with any guy at this point, it would be on the rebound because I am still to get over my ex-boyfriend.”
 
 
  
 
 Rohit adds, “I am dating someone else. There is no truth to the rumours about me dating Akanksha.” 
 
 Well, they say that a picture speaks a thousand words. We wonder...
