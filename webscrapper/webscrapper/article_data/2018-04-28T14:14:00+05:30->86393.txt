MADURAI: The wife of arrested   assistant professor   on Saturday said there is a threat to her family if they reveal the names of the real culprits in a   involving Arupukottai college assistant professor Nirmala Devi. 

 
 Speaking to reporters here, Suja Murugan said her husband was innocent and he had been made scapegoat to protect the real culprits. 
 
 "The real offenders are at Madurai Kamaraj University, and there is a threat to our lives if we reveal their names. Let the R Santhanam committee and the CB-CID find out the truth," she said.
 
 She said it was former research scholar Karuppasamy who had introduced Nirmala Devi to her husband. Devi met Murugan when he was made the in-charge of room allocation for participants in a refresher course conducted by the university. 
 
 Nirmala Devi had sought help when she had come with Karuppasamy after her suspension, Suja said, adding, "truth can be found out by making inquiries with those who conducted the refresher course."
 
 Suja said two people from Madurai Kamaraj University had approached them asking her family to lock the house, leave for a safer place and switch off their mobile phones as Murugan was about to be arrested.
