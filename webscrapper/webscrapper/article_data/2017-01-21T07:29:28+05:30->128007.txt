ARA: Bhojpur DM   has assured proper medical facilities and safety to the participants in   formation on Saturday. He said ambulances, doctors and paramedical staff would be deployed in sufficient numbers on all human chain routes in the district.

 Auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) would be present with medical kits on every 200 metres, while one coordinator on every 1km and 1 sector magistrate would be deployed. He said people from all classes, religions and creeds have been requested to take part in the human chain to create awareness about the ill-effects of liquor consumption. 
 
 While interacting with the state chief secretary   via videoconference, the Bhojpur DM said the human chain on the main route would be 60km-long and 254km-long on the subroute in the district. In all, Ara sadar,   and Piro subdivisions, along with 19 government officials, have been assigned the task to make the human chain successful in the district. These officials have been instructed to be in regular contact with their respective subdivision officials and act according to their instructions.
 
 Meanwhile, children of various schools took out ‘prabhat pheris’ on Friday to create awareness about the proposed human chain in Ara on Saturday. They raised some catchy slogans like, ‘Jo piyega daru uske bache lagayenge jhadu’ and ‘jo hua nasha ka shikar, ujda uska ghar parivar’.
