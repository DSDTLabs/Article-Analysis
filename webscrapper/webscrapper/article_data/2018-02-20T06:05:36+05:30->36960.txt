KOLKATA: A day after state food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick’s pilot car met with an accident after a Baguiati-Ultadanga   suddenly shifted lanes, police met with auto unions and proposed changes in the auto route on VIP Road. 

 At present, Ultadanga-bound autos head straight from Dakshindari — Sunday’s accident spot — and take the VIP Road bridge to Ultadanga intersection. They take a right from there along   to reach Ultadanga station. “We have proposed changing the route as they approach Ultadanga bridge from Dakshindari and divert the traffic from the   approach,” said an officer. 
 
 
  
 If the proposed route is followed, autos will take the bridge connecting VIP Road with the Salt Lake approach and head back towards   colony. Autos will halt before they reach CIT Road opposite   station. Though this change may avert congestion and accidents, auto drivers have opposed the proposal saying passengers will find it difficult to reach Bidhannagar station. “It will be difficult for people to cross CIT Road to reach the station. Commuters trying to take autos or buses for Ahiritola will also face trouble. We have specified our opinion during the meeting,” said  , president of Baguiati-Ultadanga Auto Operators’ Union.
 
 On Monday, autos continued to change lanes as they drove along VIP Road, making abrupt halts. “We have been able to tame rogue drivers to a large extent, but some of them continue to flout traffic norms,” an officer said. 
 
 “There is an urgent need to control rogue auto drivers. Police need to conduct regular campaigns and keep tabs on those who violate rules. There are cases when autos go off route and take more passengers than stipulated. We will also sit with the unions to scan backgrounds of drivers before they get permit to ply in the area,” said Mullick.
