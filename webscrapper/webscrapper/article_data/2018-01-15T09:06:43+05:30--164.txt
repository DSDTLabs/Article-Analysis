THANE: A newborn boy was abducted from Thane Civil Hospital around 3 am on Sunday, barely four hours after his birth.

 Deputy commissioner of police D Swami said that video footage shows that the unidentified child-lifter — a woman in a pink saree — being assisted by a 12-year-old girl and a man. The three who were waiting patiently at the hospital bundle up the baby and hurriedly spirit him away. The three walk out of the hospital, moving in the direction of the railway station.
 
 The hospital authorities claimed that they currently have only two security guards while the third was on leave.
 
 The newborn’s mother,   (19), was accompanied by her husband and her mother until a few minutes before the child was lifted. However, the two stepped out for a cup of tea after which the abductor woman walked into the room.
 
 “I was awake when the woman walked up to my bed and said she was an employee of the hospital,” said Bhovar. “She took the baby from my arms, saying that my mother was sitting outside and had asked her to fetch the baby.”
 
 Bhovar, who was inconsolable, said that she learnt much later that her mother and husband were out for tea then.
 
 Bhovar, who hails from a tribal family in Bhiwandi, reached the hospital on Saturday evening. She was taken to the operation theatre where doctors assisted in a natural delivery of the boy, Bhovar’s first child, around 10.30 pm. The mother and the newborn were then wheeled into the room.
 
 Acomplaint has been lodged at   police station.
 
 Additional civil surgeon at the hospital, Dr  , said that they had requested for around 50 people for security at the hospital. “Around four months back, we gave an application to the deputy director of health services. We hope it will be sanctioned soon,” said Dr Makode.
