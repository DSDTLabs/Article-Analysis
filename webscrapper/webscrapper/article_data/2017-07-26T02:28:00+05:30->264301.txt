GURUGRAM: A day after opening the second flank of Hero Honda Flyover to traffic,   (NHAI) said a flyover at Maharana Pratap Chowk and an   constructed near   would be operational in two weeks. Sources said the work on these two infrastructure projects is almost complete and likely to be open on August 14. 

 Maharana Pratap Chowk flyover, which starts from MDI gate and ends near Sector 17 gate, will streamline heavy vehicular movement from the local bus stand to Iffco Chowk on MG Road. Besides this, it will also ensure smooth flow of traffic from   to Signature Towers.
 
 Maharana Pratap Chowk has been a traffic bottleneck as traffic coming from the local bus stand and Atul Katria Chowk merges at this point, triggering snarls, especially during rush hours. The snarls at this point will affect traffic movement on MG Road and Atul Kataria Road.
 
 “The work on the flyover is likely to be completed by mid-August,” said an NHAI official. Deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh in a review meeting on July 10 had said the flyover would be completed by August. Along with this, work on the underpass that’s being constructed at Medanta is also expected to get completed by August 14. The underpass will help commuters coming from Medanta side cross the expressway and go towards Delhi. It will emerge on the service lane — Jaipur to Delhi side— of the expressway. Earlier, people had to go up to Rajiv Chowk to take U-turn to travel towards Delhi. The underpass is expected to reduce congestion at Rajiv Chowk. It was built as part of the project to construct underpasses and flyovers at Iffco Chowk, Signature Towers and Rajiv Chowk.
 
 The project started in December 2016, and it is expected to be completed by March 2018. Till now, around 50% work has been completed.
