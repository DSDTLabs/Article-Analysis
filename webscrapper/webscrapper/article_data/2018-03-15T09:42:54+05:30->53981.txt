LUCKNOW: Hours after his party's bypoll win, SP chief   met BSP chief   at her residence after she sent a Mercedes to fetch him. Sources said the meeting of the arch-rivals was planned in a short time.

 And it happened amid much drama.
 
 Minutes after addressing a press conference post his party's emphatic win in Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls against the BJP, Akhilesh went to his house. Sources said that a senior BSP leader called up Akhilesh and congratulated him and convinced him to call up Mayawati. Akhilesh agreed and spoke to the BSP boss and sought to meet her. The BSP boss, sources said, agreed and sent one of her emissaries in a black Mercedes to Akhilesh's house on Vikramaditya Marg to escort him to her residence in Mall Avenue barely a kilometer away.
 
 Sources said that BSP national general secretary SC Mishra and BSP MP Ashok Siddharth played a key role in planning this meeting between Mayawati and Akhilesh.
 
 Around 7 pm, Akhilesh's cavalcade, escorted by the same black Mercedes, entered Mayawati's house.
 
 
 
 Though SP and BSP did not disclose as to what transpired between the two leaders, sources said that Akhilesh, sporting his trademark red topi, expressed his gratitude to Mayawati for supporting his party candidates in the high stakes byelections.
 
 After the meeting that lasted for almost an hour, Akhileshâ€™s came out of Maya's residence in his car and waved to the waiting media. He, though, did not speak.
