At one time, a sweatshirt was simply that – a shirt to sweat in at the gym or on weekends. But thanks to athleisure, luxury houses are redefining this once-upon-a-time comfort clothing which has emerged as a high fashion hero piece for men and women. Regular celeb spotting has further fuelled the trend.

 
 
 The “statement sweatshirts” are not classic grey but embroidered as showcased by Carven, with bold prints (Gucci and Balmain), satin-backed like Jason Wu, deconstructed (Michael Kors and Burberry). Kenzo made 2014 the year of the stylish sweats with embroidered iterations. Indian designers Huemn, Monisha Jaising and Shahin Mannan took the lead in creating conversation pieces. 
 
 
 Mannan — her snazzy   are quite popular with the B-town crowd — says, “Comfort is the new style. You can wear comfortable yet stylish statement pieces even in your everyday wear.” Designer Shyma Shetty has pioneered statement sweatshirts on Indian ramps. She mentions how fashion has always been an authentic representation of the times and attributes the spurt in this trend to athleisure. She says: “Comfort, effortless dressing and lazy luxury has become a go-to for the most serious fashionistas. It is also the time of the rise of separates.” So, the top as your hero piece can be styled in unique ways. 
 
 
 The sweatshirt offerings by big brands has only become wider and the updates, more luxurious. Fabrics have moved beyond typical jersey to jacquard, leather or even fur. Details like quilting, zippers, embroidery, peplums and embellishment have contributed in elevating the casual style. As Mannan says, “Nowadays designers are bringing their own twist. For instance, from day one, I was very clear that my embroideries should bring out the person’s style statement. Hence, most of our designs are not body fitted and are baggy/free size.”
 
 In an article in Business of Fashion, Tomoko Ogura, a senior fashion director with a tony New York store, had said: “For an aspirational customer, it’s an accessible way to buy into a brand… It opens the door to a new group of customers for designers.” Agrees Shetty, “Usually brands have an iconic something that can be incorporated into easy wear separates, like sweatshirts that allow customers to buy into the brand without breaking the bank.” 
 
 
 The real challenge, Mannan says, is to be different in the limited canvas available to the designer; so that it can be differentiated between gym wear to something which can also be worn at casual or formal events. Shetty says the inspiration is still from the streets, where oversized unisex styles with dropped shoulders, elongated sleeves, rule. 
 
 2018 may just be the year of cheeky sweatshirts with a play on words. Recently, a fast fashion giant found itself in the midst of controversy when social media caught on to an image on its website of an African-American child model in a sweatshirt with words, ‘Coolest monkey in the jungle’. 
 
 Bottomline: wear a statement sweatshirt but be careful of the statement it makes!
 
 
 
 - Wear it with jeans/shirts, sneakers for a casual occasion 
 - Replace shoes with heels and some earrings/bracelets for a formal occasion 
 - There are no rules other than to try not to look like you’re going to the gym
 
 
 
 Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid may be the poster girls for the sweatshirt (even athleisure) trend, but even Indian celebrities are giving a nod to them, especially when it comes to airport look
