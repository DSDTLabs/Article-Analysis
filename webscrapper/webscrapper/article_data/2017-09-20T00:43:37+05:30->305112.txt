Jaipur: Holding poor policing responsible for the murder of Jodhpur businessman  , former chief minister   has demanded removal of police commissioner  . In a press statement, Gehlot said, “Until the useless and indolent (nikamme aur nakara) policemen, including the police commissioner, are removed there is no chance of improvement in the law and order. The chief minister and the home minister not acting against the police commissioner despite being aware of the Jodhpur residents’ opinion about him (Rathod), raises several question marks.”

 Israni was shot dead by unidentified men late Sunday night, though the businessman had been granted police protection considering the threats he was receiving. “In last one year, there have been four-five firing incidents in Jodhpur but the state government did not wake and ultimately businessman Israni was killed,” said Gehlot.
 
 The former chief minister stressed that every time there was a firing incident in Jodhpur the city police and the home secretary were cautioned by people but to no avail. “Jodhpur is witnessing such conditions for the first time because of chief minister Vasundhara Raje’s apathy towards the district ever since the   government was formed,” said Gehlot. The senior Congressman, who represents   assembly constituency in the district, claimed there was none in the police administration and the district administration to listen to Jodhpur people.
