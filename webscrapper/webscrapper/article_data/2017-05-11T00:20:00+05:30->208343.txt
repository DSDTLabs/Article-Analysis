Bhopal: Atal Bihari   have convened an emergency meeting of executive council on Thursday to decide on shifting to a new premises. 

 The university had witnessed strong protests from students over its plans to shift temporarily to a private engineering college on the outskirts of the city.
 
 Hindi university is awaiting completion of its permanent campus for the past six years. President Pranab Mukherjee had laid its foundation stone in 2013. The campus is to be built on a 50-acre land on the outskirts of the state capital.
 
 Opposing the decision, students said the college where university is to shift is quite far. “Bhoj University and Hindi University are formed by the same state Act. I am not able to understand the reason why Bhoj varsity is not inclined to give space in its campus to Hindi University,” said a student pleading anonymity.
 
 Another student said university will pay Rs 7 lakh per month on rent. “Instead of wasting the amount on rent it would have been better if the money was spent on academics and salary of the teachers,” said another student. The absence of permanent infrastructure forced Hindi University to move from one building to another. The university’s administrative department is being run from a couple of rooms on Bhoj university campus. Hindi university wanted more rooms to run classes, but Bhoj University refused to entertain their demand.
 
 The university took space in Minto Hall to run classes. Last year, the state government had declared to convert Minto Hall into a convention centre. Renovation work was also started in this regard. However, the work could not take place owing to the presence of Hindi University. The university was asked to vacate the venue to speed up that work. A senior official said the university was in search of a place where they get proper infrastructure. Finally, they have found a private engineering college to shift the campus for next one year.
