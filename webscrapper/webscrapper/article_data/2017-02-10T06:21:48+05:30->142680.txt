AHMEDABAD: The state government has challenged the order passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) by which it quashed the   and penalty imposed on IPS officer  , for alleged   for which he was facing various inquiries.

 A bench of Justice A S Dave and Justice A Y Kogje scheduled a hearing of this petition for March 1.
 
 In May last year, the CAT directed the state government to restore all financial and consequential benefits to the officer for the period of suspension. However, without commenting on the merits of the inquiry and chargesheet served on him, the tribunal permitted the government to act as it deems fit in next six weeks.
 
 The 1988-batch   was penalized with reduction to a lower stage in the time scale of pay by two stages for a period of two years without cumulative effect and not adversely affecting his pension.
 
 In 2000, the state government ordered departmental inquiries against Yadav on several counts. In a controversial kidnapping case of 3-year-old Ruchi from Gandhinagar in 1999, he faced charges of mishandling the probe when he was Gandhinagar SP and the supervisory authority in this case.
 
 In 2001, he faced another inquiry for not staying at headquarters during the suspension period and then for not depositing his service revolver. He also faced an inquiry for not sending his annual property report. One of these charges was not proved and the department went ahead with proceedings on two charges.
