PUNE: The silent   agitation that started last year is gradually moving towards the state capital where the community plans to put up its final and biggest show of strength this month.

 Maratha organisations from across the state are coordinating with community members to organise more marches, including the one in   on  . 
 
 Members of the Maratha community met in Pune on Wednesday to discuss their next strategy to put pressure on the government for realising their demands.
 
 Severe punishment to the accused in the Kopardi rape and murder case, reservation for Marathas in jobs and education and amendment to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Castes (Prevention of Atrocities Act) are on the top of Maratha the community’s agenda. 
 
 Sunil Sathe, one of the organisers of the meeting here, said that the Maratha community will take out the march from Azad Maidan to Mantralaya on May 30. 
 
 “Our members will start an indefinite hunger strike in support of reservation and other demands. They will not leave Mumbai till the state government convenes a special assembly session to discuss the demands raised by the community,” he said. 
 
 All political parties, including the ruling BJP, have announced support to the demands made by the Marathas. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has told Maratha leaders that the state government was committed to providing reservation to the dominant community in Maharashtra.
 
 Leader of the opposition in state Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said the state government was not taking any concrete step to fulfil the assurances given to the community. He added that the Congress stands with the community and actively supports the agitation. 
 
 Shiv Sena executive president Uddhav Thackeray has also extended his support to the community, while   organisations have expressed strong opposition to include Marathas in the Other Backward Community (OBC) category.
