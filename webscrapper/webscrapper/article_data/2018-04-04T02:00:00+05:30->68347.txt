PATNA: The door-to-door garbage collection facility, which was launched for maintaining   in the state capital in April last year, has not been properly implemented by the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), claim city residents. Now, they have no choice, but to dump waste materials here and there.

 Calling the civic body’s door-to-door trash collection facility a “failure”, Jakkanpur resident Rita Sinha complained that nobody picked up garbage from her house. “PMC workers had started collecting waste materials from every house in April last year, but they disappeared in less than a week,” Sinha, who has now hired a private agency to collect garbage from her doorstep, told this newspaper.
 
 New Pataliputra Colony resident Ghazala Siddiqui, Shivpuri’s Vinita Kumari and Frazer Road resident Deepika Agarwal shared similar experiences. Just a week after the launch of the door-to-door garbage collection facility, PMC workers were nowhere to be seen. So, the locals began dumping all their garbage wherever they wanted to.
 
 PMC deputy municipal commissioner Vishal Anand admitted that the door-to door garbage collection facility, which was launched on a public-private partnership mode, had not been carried out for the last two months.
 
 “We will terminate the contract of the private agency that was hired to look after the work. Besides, we will hold a meeting with officials of the urban development and housing department to discuss waste management soon,” Anand said.
