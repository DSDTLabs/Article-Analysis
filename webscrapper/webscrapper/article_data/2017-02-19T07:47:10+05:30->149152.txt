PANAJI: Rajya Sabha MP  , on Saturday, strongly opposed holding of the next airshow at the greenfield international airport at Mopa, Goa, permanently, stating that this could turn the   into a second “defence airport”.

 Naik said that the statement issued by chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar that the airport at Mopa could soon be the permanent venue for the   is without any authority, is malicious and is against the interest of Goa.
 
 “It is surprising that the chief minister has the audacity to declare that, if Mopa is not ready to hold the next Aero Show, it will be held at Dabolim (airport),” Naik said in a statement.
 
 Naik said that it is shocking that the defence ministry is encroaching on the jurisdiction of the civil aviation ministry, which deals with the Mopa airport. He also said that when the defence ministry had treated the   (AAI) shabbily by refusing to part with the land in possession of the Navy which was to be used for expansion and upgrading the civilian airport at Dabolim, there is no moral authority vested in the defence ministry by which it could seek any land from the AAI.

 Since, the Aero Show will be on a permanent basis, Mopa will indirectly be a defence ministry airport for all practical purposes, Naik said. TNN
