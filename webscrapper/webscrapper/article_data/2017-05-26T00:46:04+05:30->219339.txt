NEW DELHI: Shop owners encroaching upon prime land around   will have to vacate the premises by May-end as the   on Thursday refused to extend the deadline fixed by it.

 A group of shop owners urged a vacation bench of Justice L   and Justice Navin Sinha to grant them more time to remove their shops and pleaded for modification of the apex court’s order passed on April 13 by which they were granted time till May-end to vacate the premises. They contended that they had been running the shops since 1942 and sought more time to get out of the premises.
 
 The bench, however, turned down their plea saying it could not modify the order passed by another bench. 
 
 The Supreme Court’s firm stand against encroachments by religious institutions had forced Haji Ali Dargah Trust on April 13 to agree to demolish illegal structures on 737 sq m of land abutting the access pathway to the shrine. The HC had ordered the formation of a task force to remove illegal encroachments on the approach road leading to the shrine. 
 
 The trust thereafter approached the SC, which asked it to take proactive steps to remove encroachments.
