CHENNAI: As reported by TOI first, Southern Railway has planned to introduce ‘Anubhuti’ coach in Chennai Central – Mysuru – Chennai Central sector as a Pongal gift to its passengers.

 Accordingly, Train No.12007 / 12008 Chennai Central – Mysuru – Chennai Central   trains will be augmented by an ‘Anubhuti’ coach on and from Friday, January 12. 
 
 Bookings are open now. However, for booking accommodation on  , passengers will have to use the number 22007 and 22008 instead of 12007 and 12008. This is applicable only for passengers booking accommodation on Anubhuti coach.
 
  The fare for travel on Anubhuti coach is fixed at 1.2 times of the executive class fare on   trains. 
 
 The coach has improved interiors, ergonomically designed seats, and improved modular toilets with hands-free taps. Overhead reading lights are also provided for every seat. 
 
 Currently, the ticket fare for executive class coach on the train from Chennai to Mysuru is Rs 1,835 and Rs 1,445 up to Bengaluru. So this means, the fare for a seat on Anubhuti coach will be around Rs 2,200 and Rs 1,735 respectively.
 
 This is double of what the most luxurious buses run by   (KSRTC) charge for a seat. However, KSRTC volvo buses have scant services during the day and take around 6-7 hours to reach Bengaluru from the city.
 
  In comparison, Shatabdi Express takes only four hours and fifty minutes to reach Bengaluru, and a further two hours to reach Mysuru.
 
  “People who generally take flights might shift to Shatabdi due to these additional amenities,” said top officials. Also, seats remaining vacant at the time of first charting shall be offered for current booking at 10% discount on last price, and hence this will also be an added attraction, officials said.
