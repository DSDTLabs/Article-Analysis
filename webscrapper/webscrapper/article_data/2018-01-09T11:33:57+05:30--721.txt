The lone publisher who was supposed to represent Pakistan at the ongoing 26th annual New Delhi World Book Fair did not turn up at the event.

 Al Hasanat Books Private Ltd, a distributor of some of the publishers from Pakistan, is representing the country in the international pavilion.
 
 "We are aware of the prevailing tension between the countries. It is difficult to acquire a visa. Also our publishers are busy attending book fairs in other countries,"   of Al Hasanat told IANS.
 
 Last year also no publisher from Pakistan attended the event and the same distributor had represented the country at the World Book Fair.
 
 However, a press conference last week, event co-organser National Book Trust (NBT) had specifically mentioned that a publisher from Pakistan will be attending this year.
 
 "There might have been some issue regarding visa. World Book Fair is open for all. We don't choose any publisher. Anyone from any country is free to submit their nomination," an NBT official stated.
 
 Unlike other countries, Pakistan's name was missing from its billboard at the stall and merely stated "Children's Books". The only mention of the country is on a board outside the international pavilion. Asked about this, an NBT official said this might have happened "by mistake" and "we will soon add the name".
 
 Faheem said that the billboard was given by the organisers, adding this won't affect them much as it is the books on display that matters.
 
 "Name of a country or publishing brand doesn't matter us much. If our books are good and worth reading, readers and book lovers will be anyway drawn towards our stall. We have books from different publishers from Pakistan, children's books, literature, shayari and religious. Hope visitors will like it," he pointed out.
