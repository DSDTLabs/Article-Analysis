BHUBANESWAR: Residents of Shastri Nagar have been under house arrest for the past five days, thanks to the construction of drains on both sides of the road passing through the area. 

 Senior citizens requiring ambulances are being physically carried to them, while children are having to walk down a few hundred metres to board their school vans. The construction has also forced two-wheeler riders to risk life and limb while navigating the narrow strip of the road left for use.
 
 "The contractor and the local counsellor had assured us that work on one side of the road would begin only after the other side was done. Now both sides of the road have been dug up. We are not able to take out our cars, nor are other vehicles being able to enter the locality. Patients and senior citizens are the most affected," said  , a resident of Shastri Nagar.
 
 "It is very unsafe to ride two-wheelers on this road, especially if children or women are riding pillion. There is no end to the ordeal as construction work has been on for months now," said  , a resident of Ekamra Villa. Citizens said lack of planning and monitoring by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation ( ) had led to the problem. "It is common sense that construction must be done in phases so that people don't suffer. Either the contractor has done this deliberately or the authorities have turned a blind eye," said  , a senior citizen of Unit-6.
 
 In response to a tweet, the BMC said, "Drainage work will completed within a week."
