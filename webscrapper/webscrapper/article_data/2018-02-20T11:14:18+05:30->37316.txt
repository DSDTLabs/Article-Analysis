NEW DELHI: The   ( ) has agreed to hear a   seeking an independent inquiry into the scam perpetrated on Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, allegedly by diamond billionaire  . 

 
 The SC said it will take up the plea for hearing on Friday. A bench led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra will hear the plea filed by lawyer Vineet Dhanda.
 
 Modi is alleged to have defrauded PNB of $1.8 billion which he got in the form of loans - all from a single bank branch in Mumbai. Police allege 
  and others conspired with several employees of the state-run bank to fraudulently obtain advances for paying overseas suppliers.
 
 Dhanda's plea also seeks the framing of guidelines for sanctioning of loans of amounts higher than Rs 10 crore by banks.
 
 On January 29, a PNB official from Mumbai filed a criminal complaint with the CBI against three companies and four people, including Modi and Mehul Choksi, the managing director of Gitanjali Gems Ltd, saying they had defrauded the bank and caused a loss of Rs 2.8 billion.
 
 The bank alleged two junior employees at the Mumbai branch had helped the companies and people managing them get “letters of undertaking” (LoUs) from it without having a sanctioned credit limit or maintaining funds “on margin”. The LoUs were used to obtain short-term credit from overseas branches of other Indian banks, PNB said.
 
 Based on the complaint, the CBI registered a preliminary case against the companies and the people named on Jan. 31 and PNB said a detailed probe was underway.
