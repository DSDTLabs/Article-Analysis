Visakhapatnam: The BJP MLA of Visakha North, P Vishnu Kumar Raju suggested that the state government appoint one more special investigation team ( ) as tampering of land records is widespread in Visakhapatnam. He said the number of petitions have already crossed 2,000 and it would be difficult for the four or five officers to look into all the petitions. 

 The BJP floor leader in the Andhra Pradesh state assembly, Vishnu Kumar Raju met with the SIT chief Vineet Brijlal on Saturday at the SIT office and handed over documents pertaining to different land scams and tampering of records. Speaking to media persons, the MLA demanded that the government should take action against the officer responsible for the unscrupulous practices inconsiderate of his position. 
 
 Kumar Raju requested the government to extend the date for receiving petitions from the public as the number of petitions have been increasing every day. He urged the SIT chief not to send the petitions received by the district collector office to the tahesildar’s office. “If they do that then the problem will go back to the drawing board. A 7-acre land survey number 13-3 of Madhavadhara was claimed by a person named Sanapala Seetaram, of which 2 acres belong to the government. Even after recognising the government’s land the officials have not filed any counter in the court. This has been given rise to suspicion,” he said.
