NAGPUR: After 41 years, the state government has amended the Maharashtra (Urban Areas)  , 1975. The amended act may have simplified the process but has several lacunae according to an expert TOI spoke to. 

 As per the amended Maharashtra (Urban Areas) Protection and Preservation of Trees Act, 2016, permission of tree authority is not needed if the number of trees to be felled is 25 or less. The permission of municipal commissioner or chief officer of the   will suffice.
 
 As per the earlier act, the tree authority had 60 days to grant permission for felling trees from the date of application. Now this duration has been reduced to 45 days. 
 
 “This is a good move as the procedure is being fast-tracked,” said founder of   Kaustav Chatterjee.
 
 In another positive, the tree authority will now meet every fortnight instead of every month. 
 
 The amended act also envisages appointment of a tree officer who will grant permission for tree felling. However on the flip side, the tree officer need not go on the spot for inspection if the applicant submits satellite images and details of trees to be felled. “Unless the inspector visits the spot, he wouldn’t get a fair idea,” pointed out Chatterjee.
 
 In the new act, compensatory plantations against felled trees have to be done as per 1:2 ratio. Till now, compensatory plantations in the city were done in the ratio of 1:5 as per   (NMC) rules. 
 
 “The amended acts states that compensatory plantations have to be done within 15 days after tree-felling. But ideally it should be vice versa. Compensatory plantations should be carried out before felling,” said Chatterjee.
 
 He added that plantations should be done ‘mandatorily’ at the same site and not ‘preferably’.
