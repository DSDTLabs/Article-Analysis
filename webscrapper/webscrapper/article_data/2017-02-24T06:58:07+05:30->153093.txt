PILIBHIT: Two days after a   allegedly murdered a six-year-old boy and consumed human flesh, as alleged by the relatives of the victim, after chopping the body into pieces in Amaria town, the district magistrate (DM) of Pilibhit on Thursday directed the police to put the accused on trial under the   (NSA). The DM also directed the cops to take the accused, Nazim Mian, into police custody and interrogate him to establish the motive behind the gruesome act.
 
  Terming the murder of Monis as a "devilish act", district magistrate Masoom Ali Sarvar said Tuesday's incident has brought back memories of the 2006 case of serial killings of children in Nithari, in which the accused, Surender Koli, was also found guilty of consuming human flesh.
  
  The DM said the Amaria murder case was rarest of rare and, hence, the accused should be tried under NSA. “The horrific incident has sent a chill down the spines of the citizens of the entire district. Thousands of local people in Amaria also came out to the streets on Wednesday demanding that the culprit be hanged. It is imperative that the accused be awarded the harshest of punishment in order to instil a sense of security among the people."
  
  Sarvar said the police department had been directed to initiate the proceedings to slap NSA on the accused. He said he would also discuss the issue of taking the culprit into police remand with superintendent of police Dev Ranjan.
  
  Additional superintendent of police Ram Suresh Yadav told TOI that police have already started the process to slap NSA on Nazim. “It will take time as the proceedings of slapping NSA on the accused has to go through many phases of reporting and official approvals,” Yadav said.
