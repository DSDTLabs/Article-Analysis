NAGPUR: Even though no stabbing incident has been registered after January 30, the fear of the serial stabber is still alive. On Thursday, rumours of another attack went around after a 20-year-old woman received minor knife injuries on her hand near TB ward at GMCH. However, the cops clarified that she was accidentally injured by an unidentified goon running down the road with a knife in hand to save himself from two attackers.

 News of the ‘serial stabber’ attack went viral on social media sites, claiming another woman, identified as  , was the victim this time. Earlier too, several trivial matters had been linked to the serial stabber, but nothing came to fore after inquiry.
 
 When TOI spoke to senior police inspector of Imambada police station  , he said, “Two unknown goons were chasing another unidentified goon on the stretch over an internal matter. When the running man saw some 15 motorcyclists, including Bharti, stopped at the square at the red signal, he started shouting to give him space to run.”
 
 The frightened goon with a knife in his hand brushed past Bharti, an MBBS student, leaving her with a minor injury on the hand, added PI. Bharti, who was heading to GMCH, started screaming, which alerted others. Bharti, a resident of Mangalwari, Sadar, went to college, took first aid and later lodged a complaint at the police station, said Katkede. Police have registered offence of causing hurt by endangering life under section 337 of IPC.
 
 The unidentified bike-borne serial stabber has reportedly attacked six women in Hudkeshwar, Sakkardara and Ajni between January 4 and January 30. Cops have deployed plainclothes personnel to try and nab the man. Cops believe, the miscreant first observes the woman and then stabs her.
