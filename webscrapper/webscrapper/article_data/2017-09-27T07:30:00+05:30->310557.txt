Chandigarh: A local court has held a father-in-law and brother-in-law of a woman   of raping her in a more than one-and-a-half-year-old case and convicted her sister-in-law (wife of husband’s elder brother) of hatching a conspiracy.

 The survivor had delivered a child, whose DNA had matched with that of the woman’s father-in-law.
 
 The court would pronounce the quantum of sentence on September 28.
 
 The matter dates back to November 2015, when the woman lodged a complaint with the police. The woman got married in 2010. Her husband was mentally and physically challenged. The woman alleged her father-in-law started to molest her initially. After a few months, he and his elder son started to physically assault her, the complaint alleged. The woman alleged her brother-in-law’s wife used to mix sedatives in her milk. When she used to fall unconscious, the two used to   her, the complaint alleged. The three had also allegedly threatened to kill her husband if she told anybody about the assaults.
 
 The woman finally narrated the incident to her sister and demanded a DNA test of her child and father-in-law. The DNA report confirmed that the father-in-law was the father of the child.
 
 In the district court, additional and sessions judge Poonam R Joshi held the three guilty under sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, with intent to commit an offence), 376 (punishment for rape), 498 (enticing or taking away or detaining with criminal intent a married woman), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
 
  Child’s DNA matched with 1 convict
 
 A DNA report had said that the father-in-law of the woman was the father of her child. The woman’s sister-in-law (wife of husband’s elder brother) was also held guilty in the case. The rape survivor had alleged that she used to goad the two persons to rape her and helped them too.
