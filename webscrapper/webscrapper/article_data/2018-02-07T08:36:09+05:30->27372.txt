BICHOLIM: The mother of the woman who was allegedly held captive for 22 years refuted all allegations against her and said that she had not tortured her daughter   and, on the contrary, had kept the victim in the separate room to protect her from “bad elements”.

 On Saturday, members of Vasco-based NGO   said they had rescued a 45-year-old woman who was held captive by her mother   for the last 22 years at her home in Bhandarwada, Sakhali.
 
 The woman’s mother, in her statement, said she had to do this out of love for her daughter. She added that the victim was depressed after she failed Class XII and consequently her second year BA due to which she started behaving strangely. “Following her mental illness we decided to keep her in a separate room to overcome her frustration,” Vandana said. She added that they provided her with proper food, tea and a bed. She refused to talk about why they had blocked the window with a pillow, and said her son had prohibited her from saying more.
