GURUGRAM: Taking action against the   ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants in the district, the labour department has fined and   owners of 45 sites in Gurugram. These plants were not registered with the department, and were becoming a   and safety hazard to the workers.

 In December 2016, a complaint was filed at CM Manohar Lal Khattarâ€™s office. A labour union complained that there are illegal RMC plants which are functioning without any registration. Following this, a joint committee comprising officials from Haryana Pollution Control Board (HPCB) , Labour Department, and Excise and Taxation Department was formed to look into the matter. Notably, an RMC plant usually employs 20-25 workers.
 
 The committee inspected 164 plants across Gurugram over a period of six months. During this, it was discovered that there are 119 registered RMC plants in  , including 66 plants, which have been registered under the Labour Act. The committee has fined each of these plants for a minimum of Rs 1 lakh. Legal action has also been initiated against them.
