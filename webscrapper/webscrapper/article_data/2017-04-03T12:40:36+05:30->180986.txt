 Currently, the traffic police have also launched a campaign against errant autorickshaw drivers and are confiscating vehicles of drivers who are not carrying proper documents and papers.
 
 Errant autorickshaw drivers are also being called to the city traffic branch office along with their vehicle documents. They are then given special stickers to be pasted on their vehicle.
 
 The stickers indicate that the concerned autorickshaw has all the documents for operating on city roads. A few weeks from now, the traffic police will zero in on autorickshaws that do not have these stickers.
