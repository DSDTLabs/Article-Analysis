TRICHY: The Trichy international airport is to get a state-of-the-art two-level integrated terminal to be built at a cost of Rs 897 crore. Unveiling the plan here on Friday, Airports Authority of India (AAI) said the terminal would be a model for raising similar facilities at other airports in the country.

 The move comes after saturation of the existing terminal which could handle 1.35 million passengers last year. The new terminal will be six times bigger than the existing one and will be able to handle 3.52 million passengers a year. A four-member team from M/S EGIS -- A France- based Project Management Consultant (PMC) -- along with   (AAI) officials visited the airport on Thursday. They unveiled the final design of the terminal after a marathon meeting.
 
 “A global tender would be floated soon to award contract for the construction of the new terminal which is likely to start in March 2018,” said  , general manager,  , AAI. “If everything goes as per plan, the terminal will be ready for use in the next three years,” he said.
 
 “We want to ensure that we are not dependent on the state government for power and water. Hence the entire building will be lit with lED lights and we also have plans to raise solar power plants. Not a single drop of liquid waste will go out into the water bodies. Liquid waste would be processed in sewerage treatment plant,” said Jindal. 
 
 The new terminal with a peak hour capacity of 2,700 passengers (2,200 international and 500 domestic) will have a basement with airside corridor, approach road and canopy for passenger facilitation.
