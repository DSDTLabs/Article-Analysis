 BHOPAL: Artisans from across the country, participating in ' ' exhibition, at   have a grouse. They say ever since the   has kicked in, they are being made to pay additional taxes on their artefacts. And the fall-out? They assert, it dragged down sales. 
 
 Abdullah Faisal, a handloom weaver from Varanasi told TOI about how he uses, 'khaddi' material for Banarasi sarees. These sarees are made using silk, which do not turn black even if they are kept for 100 years. 
 
 "There was a time when I used to sell 10 sarees a day. After the GST, I am not able to sell more than two." Through his work, 25-year-old has used his profession not only to run his household, but business also sustains education of his three sisters. He said artisans like him who work day and night to earn a livelihood would be adversely affected by GST. 
 
 Simply put, GST has pushed up cost of garments by 12%. Raw material like cloth has witnessed ever before tax of 5%. Whereas inputs for making famous Bagh print of MP has increased too. There is a hike from 5% to 18% in the process.
 
 The exhibition in  's Gauhar Mahal, has been organised by Tamil Nadu government. It has brought weavers and artisans, hailing from different states on one platform, giving them a chance to generate much-needed sales. 
 
 "A 5% tax has been levied on cloth, which earlier was free of cess. On other raw materials, the cess has gone up to 18%," said national award winning artist Dhar-based Umar Faruk Khatri. 
 
 It not just taxes that artisans find taxing. The process of filing tax returns 42 times a year will prove a real tough task under the GST.
