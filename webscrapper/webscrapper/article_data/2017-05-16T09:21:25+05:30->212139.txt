Vadodara: Scores of parents on Monday rushed to the office of Vadodara district education officer (DEO) alleging that their wards were being denied admissions by schools under the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009 despite directives from state education department.

 Many parents have also demanded that the schools allotted to them under RTE Act 2009 should be changed and their wards be enrolled in other schools. DEO M L Ratnu, however, said that the confusion regarding schools denying admissions under RTE has surfaced as the parents have received the messages on their mobiles or cell phones directly from Gandhinagar. 
 
 “Since Sunday was a holiday the schools were not intimated about the list of students who have been sanctioned admissions under RTE. We have informed the parents that on Tuesday the details will be available with all the schools and their wards will be admitted by the respective schools,” said Ratnu. 
 
 It is worth mentioning here that the admission process for 25 % reservation in private schools under RTE has become online from this academic year. Regarding the objections raised by parents on allocation of schools, Ratnu said that the admissions have been sanctioned as per the rules. 
 
 Of the 4,200 admissions granted under the RTE this year, the DEO office has received 952 applications from parents seeking change in schools.
