What happens when Arjun, an immigrant Indian student in the US, and Sana, a middle-aged Indian woman also in the US, who wants freedom from her abusive husband and a monotonous life, drive from  , across   and into  ? That’s the premise of Suman Nagarkar’s next film, Babru, which has been shot across America, consisting of a crew who are all based in USA.

 “This is a unique film because it is among the first feature-length Kannada film to be completely made in the US. And shooting for it was a completely different experience. At any given time, we would be six people on set, so everyone was doing everything. It is a travel movie, but we haven’t shown the usual monuments in the US, like the   or the Statue of Liberty,” says Suman.
 
 Since all the crew members have regular day jobs, the film was shot over 30 days, spread over three months, on weekends. Suman, who has also produced the film, says that she hopes that with this film, people will see that heroines don’t need to be in their 20s or early 30s. “In English films, the heroines can be in their 40s or 50s and it doesn’t matter, because it is the story that matters. I want to see that in Indian films as well. And with new filmmakers coming up with new stories, I hope that this will become a reality soon,” she signs off.
