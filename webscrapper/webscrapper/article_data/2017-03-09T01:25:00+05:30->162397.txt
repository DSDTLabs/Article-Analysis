Panaji: A 77-year-old man from Carmona in South Goa was duped of Rs 17.94 lakh by unknown persons who contacted him via SMS and email informing him that he had won Rs 3.6 crore. To receive the prize money he was asked to deposit Rs 17.94 lakh at various bank accounts provided by them.

 Catherine Fernandes has filed a complaint at the cyber cell, Panaji, stating that her husband Circucisao Fernandes had received a message on his mobile in August 2016, stating that he had won Rs 3.6 crore from ‘Morgan’ claiming to be an official of Samsung. 
 
 He sought personal details, including his email id, and informed him that their ambassador would be in Goa to complete the formalities to facilitate the transfer of money and he should pay certain charges and duties. The following month, the complainant said her husband received an email stating that the RBI regional director requires him to pay for the release of the prize money.
 
 Catherine said she convinced her husband to transfer the money as instructed but they received no prize money. They continued received calls to deposit a further Rs 7.10 lakh.
