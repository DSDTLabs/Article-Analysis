VADODARA: Groups supporting president of BJP’s   district unit Jasu Rathwa and sarpanch of Pavi Jetpur Ankit alias Montu Shah, got into a violent fight at Pavi Jetpur on Friday night over exchange of messages in a common WhatsApp group.

 Both the groups registered complaints of assault against each other at Pavi Jetpur police station after the violence in which at least three persons including Rathwa were injured.
 
 According to the complaint of Chirag Chauhan, a supporter of Shah, Rathwa came to his house on Friday evening and slapped him before hurling abuses at him. Rathwa left the place and met Shah in Pavi Jetpur town where the latter was present with his supporters including Chauhan. When Shah confronted Rathwa, the   president allegedly got into a scuffle with Shah.
 
 The supporters of both – Rathwa and Shah – attacked each other with stumps and wooden sticks. As the situation worsened, the police was called to control the party workers before the situation aggravated. Shah and one of his supporters were taken to government hospital in Bodeli for treatment, while Rathwa was treated at Chhota Udepur.
 
 Rathwa has alleged in his complaint that he had gone to confront Chauhan since he had shared anti-party message in the BJP group, while Chauhan has said that Rathwa posted messages alleging anti-party activities by Shah, in response to which he had only written that Shah is not a member of the chat group therefore Rathwa should send him a personal message.
 
 Sources said that Rathwa has been having problems with Shah and his supporters for their alleged anti-party activities during last year’s assembly elections which had resulted in his defeat.
