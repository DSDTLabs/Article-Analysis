Nagpur: Country’s historic and oldest tiger reserve Melghat in Amravati district has recorded a presence of 41 tigers in 2017 as per the result of Phase IV monitoring exercise conducted in around 2,000 sq km.  The tiger number in Melghat is virtually stable with the figures not increasing but going down by two as compared to 2016, when 43 tigers were recorded. The number of sub-adult cubs has also gone down from 13 to 10 this year. Generally, cubs are not considered in estimation. “The camera trapping study was carried out between December 11, 2016, and February 10, 2017. In all, 830 camera traps were set with 49,800 trap nights within the reserve and over 1,000 photographs were obtained,” said chief conservator of forests (CCF) & field director MS Reddy, who took over recently. With huge inviolate area of over 2,000 sq km, Melghat has high hopes when it comes to increasing tiger numbers but the population is almost stagnant between 30-40 over the years. Wildlife expert and president of Satpuda Foundation Kishor Rithe said, “In the backdrop of at least 14 villages being relocated in the last 15 years from the tiger reserve by spending crores of rupees, the figure of 41 tigers is not encouraging. The officials need to introspect.” Melghat has potential to accommodate over 100 tigers. It has Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) and is well staffed.  “The past field directors always took credit for relocation and under the management effective evaluation (MEE) conducted by NTCA & WII, Melghat also turned the scales by improving its grade from ‘Bad’ to ‘Very Good’ category. But tiger numbers not going up puts a question mark over conservation,” said conservationists. They said despite various problems tiger reserves like Tadoba and Pench have improved their tally to 80 tigers (1,700 sq km) and 44 tigers (660 sq km) respectively. “We don’t understand why Melghat couldn’t pick up despite being among the first nine reserves declared in 1972,” they added. Melghat officials say they put up a brave face to nab organized poachers in 2013. Though number game is not advisable in wildlife management, protection of the reserve from encroachments, fires, illegal grazing and biotic pressure is a big challenge. Poaching threat from organized and local poachers is an issue that has affected tiger numbers.
