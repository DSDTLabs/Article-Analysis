NAGPUR: After almost four days, the fire at   dumping ground was controlled on Sunday, with the unseasonal rainfall helping in dousing it.

 The   (NMC)’s fire department staffers were constantly on their toes to control the fire that broke out on Thursday on the side of  . NMC’s chief fire officer   informed that six fire tenders were engaged in firefighting operations for the entire night on Friday. “On Saturday, four tenders were deployed. The roots of the fire are deep inside the heaps of solid waste and due to presence of methane gas, fire is breaking out at different pockets,” he said adding that two tenders are still present at the spot. 
 
 While earlier the cause of fire was ascertained to be natural, officials now suspect involvement of some miscreants. “On the night we doused the fire and returned, we got to know that a blazing fire had broke out again within an hour. It can either be the ragpickers or some aggrieved residents who want the dumping yard to be shifted,” said some NMC staffers. 
 
 While fires at the dump yard in summers were common, this is the fourth fire of this winter. In December, the dumping yard had caught fire twice in a span of 20 days. NMC officials said that they are planning to increase the security of the yard to avoid entry of outsiders.
