AURANGABAD: Maharashtra minister   on Thursday said the state government would soon provide   to girl students at  .

  “Considering the low percentage of use of these napkins, the government will offer it a discount of 50%. It has been found that over 85% of menstruating women in state do not have access to sanitary products, which poses a big threat to their health. However, we are now giving final shape to a proposal of manufacturing the product through self-help groups so that it could be offered to the needy ones,” she said while speaking at an inaugural session of an exhibition of products and articles prepared by various self-help groups being held here. 
 
  speaker Haribhau Bagde, Aurangabad divisional commissioner Purushottam Bhapkar and others were also present on the occasion. 
 
 Various self-help groups from the Marathawada region will display their products at the exhibition from March 2 to 8. About 250 stalls have been put up for the expo at   grounds.
 
 Over 1,500 women from across the region are participating in the event.
 
 Apart from this, Mundhe said that the government is committed to developing a platform for products prepared by SHGs. “We are exploring opportunities to open ‘mobile exhibition centres’ so that the SHG members could effectively market their products and reach out to consumers located in remote places,” she said.
 
 Mundhe further said that she would soon finance the proposal of free-of-cost vaccination to women to prevent cases of the cervical cancer.
 
 Munde also said that government is planning to spare enough funds for the development of backward region like Marathawada and Vidarbha in the upcoming financial budget. She also said that the BJP-led Maharashtra government will come out with steps to minimise water scarcity in the region.
