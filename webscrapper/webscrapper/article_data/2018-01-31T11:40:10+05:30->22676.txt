 In a plea agreement reached with prosecutors, Salling was to face four to seven years in prison to avoid a maximum sentence of 20 years. Salling was ordered to pay each of his victims USD 50,000 and register as a sex offender. In March, Salling reached a separate USD 2.7m settlement with a woman who sued him for sexual battery.
