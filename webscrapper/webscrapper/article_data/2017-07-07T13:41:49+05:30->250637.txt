 Henry's assistant   said the composer died during the night. He would have celebrated his 90th birthday in December. France's National Orchestra said it would dedicate its performance today to his memory and the Pilharmonie de Paris concert hall announced it would give over a whole night to celebrating Henry's work in October. 
 
 'Psyche Rock' will be also played at a huge free ball in the centre of the French capital next week during the country's Bastille Day celebrations. Never one to be unduly hamstrung by modesty, Henry liked to call himself 'the father of modern music'.
