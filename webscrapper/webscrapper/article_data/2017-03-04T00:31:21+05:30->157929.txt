Hyderabad: The fledgling Telangana state is set to face a litmus test as it stares at a highest-ever   this summer. An estimate by Telangana Transco and Discoms suggests the demand is likely to touch the 10,000MW mark, which will be an all-time high. Rising temperatures coupled with increased demand from domestic and farm sector have pushed power consumption to record levels. An indication is that in February, even before peak summer, the power demand has crossed the 9000 MW mark and is racing ahead.

 Transco, however, says it’s prepared to ensure that all sectors will have no power cuts this year. Ever since the TRS government came to power, the domestic sector in Hyderabad and elsewhere was spared in peak summer in 2015 and 2016. This was ensured by implementing power cuts in commercial and agricultural sectors. This time around, no blackouts will be imposed on domestic, commercial and farm sectors, despite a surge in demand, Telangana Transco chairman and managing director D Prabhakar Rao told TOI.
 
 “We have been able to ensure this through planning. We have tied up for another 500 MW from private power generators, who will supply from March 15 till end of April. By that time, Rabi demand will dip and from May 1 and we can manage without having to buy additional power. For the first time, Telangana will see a comfortable summer, despite a huge increase in power demand,” said Prabhakar Rao.
 
 Among other steps taken by Transco are installation of 260 power transformers and laying of a 2140-km circuit line. “These will enable interruption-free power supply for Hyderabad, Rangareddy, Nalgonda, Mahabubnagar areas. But one thing we have to watch out for is how much load the existing network can handle? We have already stepped up capacity of many transformers to meet higher loads” Rao said.
