CHANDIGARH: Two wild creatures, a common   and a rat snake, would have perished if the persons responsible for saving them would not have walked an extra mile.

 Akanksha Saxena, who works with Doordarshan News, stumbled upon a small bird with a broken wing and cowering in grasses in a park outside her residence in Sector 28 A on Wednesday morning.
 
 Worrying that stray dogs and cats would harm her, she grasped the terrified bird and took it to the SPCA in Sector 38 West, and after that to a veterinary dispensary in Sector 22 to determine the injury and give her the required medical treatment.
 
 She, finally, gave the custody of the bird to Dimple Bedi  , a teacher who nurses and rehabilitates wounded and orphaned birds at her Sector 16 residence. Such birds are routinely left outside Kamra’s door -- and she takes care of the rest.
 
 This bird is both a resident species of the region and a migratory one, which flies from central Asia. It is marked by a buff – spear-shaped streaks on the back -- and is popularly known as  .
 
 The other rescue was of a rat snake, which got trapped in a net. A six-foot-long snake while climbing a tree to fetch its prey got trapped in a net. Wildlife conservationist and photographer Rick Toor, who was on his way to Oberoi Sukh Vilas hotel saw that a few farmers were trying to kill the snake.
 
 “Some superstitious and ignorant farmers were determined to bludgeon the snake to death. I told them that rat snakes are friends to farmers as only eat rodents. After hearing my plea, the farmers set the snake free,” Toor told TOI.
 
 Rat snakes are non-venomous species. These are purely carnivorous, do not eat fruits and are adept at hunting rodents and tree-borne species like birds and squirrels.
