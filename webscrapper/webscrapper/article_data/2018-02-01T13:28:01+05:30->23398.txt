NEW DELHI:   decided to present   in both Hindi and English today. 

 
 In doing so, he bucked a decades-long practice of finance ministers presenting the Union budget mostly in English. He chose his last budget before next year's general elections to change that. 
 
 Previous finance ministers, across political parties, have presented the budget almost entirely in English, bar a few Urdu, Hindi or Tamil couplets interspersed in their budget speeches. These include   across political parties, including the UPA/Congress party's Manmohan Singh and P Chidambaram, and the NDA/BJP's   and  .
