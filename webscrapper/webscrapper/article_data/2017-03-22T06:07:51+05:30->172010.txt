MUMBAI: A group of farmers rushed to the   on Tuesday against a recent move by the   (MoD) to take over 1,600 acres of land in   talukas of Thane district for a defence airport requisitioned during  . 

 “For the past one week, the defence ministry has been sending its people along with 300-400 police personnel to dispossess more than 6,000 households from 17 villages that occupy the 1,647 acres,’’ said the farmers’ advocate,  . “The land was requisitioned by the government through an order passed by the Thane collector in February, 1943 under the   ,’’ said one the 17 petitions filed by Chainu Jadhav from Nevali village.
 
 One farmer from each village moved the HC to challenge the validity of the 1943 requisition order. Pleading urgency in the wake of police presence along with heavy machinery being deployed, Thakur sought an early hearing of the matter. A bench of Chief Justice Manjula Chellur and Justice Girish Kulkarni said it would hear the matter on March 30. 
 
 The petition said the requisition was for an airport during WWII and then for six months, not in perpetuity. The lands now house villagers and their farmlands and form the basis of their livelihood, said Thakur. Jadhav’s petition said compensation was paid then but it was for “use of land and blocking it for use during the war’’ not for acquisition.
 
 The lands were never used for the purpose it was requisitioned. After WW-II ended in 1945, the requisition ended too and land owners resumed cultivation on the land. Barring a few, most families remained in possession for the last 80 years, but names of land owners were deleted from revenue records in 1955 and replaced with “Newali Aerodrome”.
