MUMBAI: A week after an 84-year-old farmer tried to end his life at Mantralaya, he passed away at   in   on Sunday evening. The deceased, Dharma  , had been on ventilator support.

 “My father expired at 7.30pm,” said Patil’s son, Narendra. Patil had attempted suicide last Monday over “inadequate” compensation for his land. Doctors had earlier said that Patil’s body was not responding well to treatment.
 
 The bone of contention was the compensation offered to more than 130 farmers for 199 hectares of their land which the government had acquired between 2009 and 2013 for a solar power project in Dhule. The decided rate of acquisition was lower than what it would have been had the land been acquired through direct negotiation.
 
 On Wednesday, the government had directed the district administration to give an ex gratia of Rs 15 lakh to Patil.
