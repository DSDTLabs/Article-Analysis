The proposed investment by the UP government in industrial development has seen a massive jump over last year. Against Rs 20 crore sanctioned for implementing the Industrial, Investment and Employment Generation Policy-2017, the government has earmarked Rs 1,100 crore for the previous industrial development policy and another Rs 500 crore for the new industrial policy.

 UP government is targeting investments of Rs 1 lakh crore in the state every year for the next five years.
 
 A new industrial policy unveiled last year sets out special sops for those investing in the state, with even   etc., for those who invest in   and Purvanchal.
 
 It has also brought out sector-specific policies to encourage investment in agro, food processing, renewable energy, manufacturing etc.
 
 “The allocation of funds since last year has increased massively. In 2017-18, the government has made provision of Rs 10 crore for single window clearance. The government has managed to put this system in place under its ease of doing business policy. We are about to host one Investors’ Summit this month and another in October. Meanwhile, the chief minister may also travel to the US to interact with the business community there,” said a senior government official.
 
 The government has further made a provision of Rs 250 crore for the implementation of ‘One district one product’, a new scheme under which it has identified special crafts or products of a specific area and will promote the products through schemes and marketing. This, said officials, will provide a massive fillip to the MSME sector in the state.
 
 The budget has made provision of Rs 50 crore under the UP Handloom, Powerloom, Silk, Textiles and Garmenting Policy-2017 and Rs 150 crore for providing electricity to powerloom weavers at concessional rates.
 
 To promote khadi and village industries, Rs 25 crore has been allocated for the implementation of the Khadi and   Employment Promotion Policy.
