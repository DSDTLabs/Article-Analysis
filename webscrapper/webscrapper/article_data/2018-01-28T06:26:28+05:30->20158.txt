JAIPUR: Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chairperson   on Saturday said he would not attend the Jaipur Literature festival (JLF) to ensure that the festival focusses on “creativity and not controversy”. Joshi’s statement comes days after   (SRKS) president   had warned that the CBFC chief would not be allowed to enter Rajasthan as he had ignored the sentiments of the Rajputs by giving a green signal to Padmaavat.

 Joshi was scheduled to speak at a session, ‘Main aur Woh: Conversations with Myself’, on Sunday evening. By deciding to give JLF a miss, Joshi has prevented SRKS from receiving the publicity it hoped for through its protests at the venue against Padmaavat.
 
 “I am doing this so as to not compromise the dignity of the event or cause discomfort to organisers, fellow writers or attendees. And also so that lovers of literature can focus on creativity and not controversy,” Joshi said in a statement that was circulated by the organisers. He added that he would “miss sharing great moments with literature and poetry lovers”.
 
 Speaking on the issue of CBFC’s certification to the film, he said: “I did my job and sincerely took a sensitive and balanced call. As I have said earlier, certification was done following due processes, incorporating valid suggestions while staying mindful of the concerns of society as well as to the canvas of cinema.” He added that it was “sad that we are not relying on genuine peaceful dialogue”.
 
 “It’s important that we keep mutual trust and faith in each other and our institutions so that the issues don’t reach this far,” he said.
 
 JLF producer   said “violence has no place in the narrative of a new India and those who ignite the flame of hatred will be consumed by it”.
