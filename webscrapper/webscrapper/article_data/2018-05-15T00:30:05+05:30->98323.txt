Trichy: The Agriculture Marketing and Agriculture Business department has sold out as many as  ,550 applications in the past week to the traders interested in occupying new shops available in the integrated vegetable market in Kallikudi, in city outskirts. Monday being the final day to avail applications, heavy rush persisted in agriculture marketing department office on Madurai road to receive applications that forced the officials to extend their working hours to distribute the applications for traders waiting in the serpentine queue.

 As the application distribution process aimed at relocating the wholesale traders from congested Gandhi Market to integrated vegetable market in Kallikudi commenced by May 7, traders both from Gandhi Market and other parts of the city showed immense interest in applying for a shop. 
 
 “All the traders including vegetable traders have submitted application to avail shops in Kallikudi market. We will form a committee to scrutinise the submissions, post which eligible beneficiaries will be identified,” an official with agriculture marketing and agriculture business department said.
 
 On Monday more than 250 applications were issued by the department. Since the district administration has declared that a ban would be imposed from June 1 that would prevent the entry for heavy vehicles to Gandhi Market, sources said that the measure pushed several hesitant traders to opt for a shop in new market complex in Kallikudi built at the cost of Rs 65 crore in about 9.4 acres in 2014. While the filled-in applications will be accepted by the agriculture marketing department for the next few days, within a month selection committee comprising stakeholder departments would finalise a list of beneficiaries.
