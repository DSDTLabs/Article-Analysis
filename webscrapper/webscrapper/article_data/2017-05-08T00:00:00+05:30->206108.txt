It was a trip down the memory lane when the 14th Kerala Legislative Assembly convened at the old assembly hall of the Secretariat complex in Trivandrum. 

 The special session was held to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the first meeting of the first   on April 27, 1957.
  While many of the senior comrades became nostalgic when they took their seats, the young representatives could be seen being thrilled to be part of the assembly, just like in the past. The space constraints and lack of cosy amenities were no impediments to the excitement that was in the air. We also saw some ministers busy spotting names of those who attended the last session held in the hall on June 29, 1998.
 
  MLA and actor KB Ganesh Kumar and MK Muneer, former minister for Social Welfare and Panchayat, looked proud as the old assembly hall had an association with their family lineage. Ganesh Kumar recalled, “It is an emotional moment for me as my father R Balakrishna Pillai who served as minister under UDF ministry and my grandfather, Keezhoote Raman Pillai a member of Sri Moolam Assembly formed in October 1, 1904 had attended sittings in the same hall.”
 
  MK Muneer too had similar sentiments to share as he said that he was sitting in the very same seat that his father and former chief minister C H Muhammed Koya had occupied. 
  The complex, which is more than a century old, was primarily planned to accommodate Travancore Royal Durbar Hall where the king met his council of ministers every month.
