AMRITSAR: While stating that it was unfortunate to force a Sikh to wear helmet, Akal Takht   Giani Gurbachan Singh cautioned the courts against playing with the religious sentiments of Sikhs.

 In a release issued here on Monday, the jathedar said, “How will the judges, who themselves are ignorant about the significance of a turban in a Sikh’s life, deliver justice?”
 
 He was reacting to the Supreme Court’s question whether wearing a turban was integral to the Sikh religion while hearing a writ filed by cyclist  , challenging a cycling association’s rules mandating to wear a helmet for participating in the competition.
 
 The jathedar advised the judges to first go through the Sikh and the Indian history to know how Sikhs, who contributed the most during the Indian freedom struggle, looked like. “Any objectionable decision with respect to turban will not be tolerable by the Sikhs,” he said.
