HYDERABAD: Assuaging the apprehensions of the archaeology department, the Hyderabad High Court on Friday stayed the order of a single judge who ordered the demolition of a compound wall built at Asmanghad near   around a memorial pillar. It was erected in the memory of Monsieur  , a French General in Nizam’s military and the founder of Gunfoundry. This structure is also known as Raymond’s obelisk or tomb. Private individuals are fighting with the archaeology department over the land’s title. A single judge in March last year gave a finding that the archaeology wing crossed its area and built the compound wall in an area that includes plots of private people too. The judge made this ruling after hearing V Swarupa Rani and few others who challenged the actions of the wing.

 
 Arguing the case of the archaeology director,   advocate general D Prakash Reddy told the court that the compound wall was built in 7.3 acres. The petitioner’s claim is over 2 acres. But the single judge ordered demolition to an extent of 3 acres which was not sought by the petitioners, the   said. The bench said it would examine the issue and stayed the order for 4 weeks.
