PUNE: The storm that threatened to dent India’s gymnastics medal hopes at the upcoming Commonwealth Games seems to have blown off with the Indian Olympic Association on Wednesday agreeing to field the team selected by the  .

 
 IOA’s climbdown came after gymnast   approached the   seeking relief as the three-member selection panel dithered from declaring the team even though weeks had passed since the trials were held in Delhi on February 12-13.
 
 “The   agreed in the court that they would forward the names selected by the GFI,” said  , an executive member of the national body. “The IOA was already in the wrong by taking up on itself the role of selecting the team, which is the prerogative of the GFI. Even the International Olympic Committee has been made aware, and the   views these violations seriously,” he added. The gymnast himself was a relieved man. “The last few days have been very tense. It has been more than 15 days (since the trials were held) and the entry is being given only now, one can’t imagine how it has been these few days,” Patra told TOI. “Despite all this, I had to train. It was very difficult mentally. But now I feel free as I can focus on my preparation fully.”
 
 Patra, 26, filed his petition in the Delhi HC on Tuesday amid reports that his name has been omitted from the team picked by the selection panel which, however, didn’t announce the same officially.
 
 With Wednesday being the deadline for submitting team list, the GFI went ahead announced its team which comprised Patra, Ashish Kumar, Yogeshwar Singh, Aruna Reddy, Pranati Nayak and Pranati Das.
 
 The GFI was de-recognised by the sports ministry in 2015 due to factionalism.
