VASCO: Churchill Brothers SCâ€™s fight for survival in the   will go down to the final 90 minutes after they lost 1-2 against   at the Tilak Maidan in Vasco on Saturday.
 
 
 Churchill needed three points from their last two games to avoid the drop and were hopeful of making amends in their final home game against the Kolkata giants.
 
 After a dull first session, Man-of-the-Match   put Mohun Bagan ahead in the 54th minute and Churchill captain   gave his side a glimmer of hope when he equalised in the 74th minute.
 
 However, two minutes later, former Churchill striker   headed home to give Mohun Bagan the lead for the second time. The visitors hung on to their lead till the end and kept their hopes alive of winning the title.
 
 Mohun Bagan have moved to the third position with 30 points and should other results go their way, will seal an unlikely title when the likes of Minerva Punjab, East Bengal and   have all been hailed as favourites.
 
 Churchill remained in ninth position with 17 points from as many matches, two points less than relegation rivals Chennai City FC. It will be a do-or-die clash for Churchill in their concluding clash as they must win against leaders Minerva Punjab on March 8 or get relegated to the second division I-League.
 
 Churchill missed right-back Wayne Vaz due to injury and midfielder Israil Gurung was asked to take that spot. Churchill were under pressure from the start. Britto PM and Uttam Rai continuously sent in crosses from the flanks but strikers Onyeama Okechukwu and Jeancy Siyo left a lot to be desired.
 
 In the 34th minute, Churchill were left frustrated after a goal was disallowed. Centre-back Monday had done well to head past Shilton after a freekick from Gurung but referee Om Prakash Thakur spotted Okechukwu committing a foul on Kingsley Eze inside the box.
