LUCKNOW:A year after the mysterious death of   officer  , investigation agencies have not reached a conclusion regarding the cause of it.

 
 The 2007-batch Karnataka cadre officer was found dead outside the state guest house on Meerabai Marg on the morning of May 17, 2017.
 
 The   ( ) had taken over the investigation a month after the incident as police were not able to prove anything.
 
 On Wednesday, CBI said that doctors at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) would verify whether cannabis overdose caused his death. Results are awaited. Samples have also been sent for forensic examination.
 
 Tewari hailed from   and was serving as the food and civil supplies commissioner in Bengaluru. He had gone to Mussoorie for a training programme and was in Lucknow from May 16 on way to Bengaluru.
 
 On the same night, he celebrated his 36th birthday with his friends at the guest house. Hours later, his body was spotted on the road around 7am.
 
 The SSP had formed a team to investigate the case. Police recreated the crime scene and visited his residence but nothing could be proved.
 
 Before handing over the case to CBI, police said that Tewari had probably died because of a drug overdose and heart attack. When CBI began probe, it first said that Tewari could have been hit by a vehicle. However, after analysing the postmortem examination report, CBI termed it murder.
 
 At his house in Bengaluru, CBI found spyware (a software used to steal information from another system) installed in his computer. The team also found micro cameras in his belongings. The shop from where Tewari had purchased these tools was also probed.
 
 
 Tewari’s elder brother Mayank said, “Even after one year, nothing has changed for us.   solved the water crisis in Bidar district in Karnataka but the state government has not released his salary dues. He was probing a case against an IAS officer in Karnataka and was threatened but CBI has not probed this angle.”
