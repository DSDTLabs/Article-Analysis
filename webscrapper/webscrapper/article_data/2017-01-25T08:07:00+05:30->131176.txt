KOCHI: A  , cinema hall owners and film distributors, named Film Exhibitors United Organisation of Kerala (FEUOK), was formed in Kochi on Tuesday. Actor-producer Dileep is the president of the organisation while Antony Perumbavoor is the vice president. 

 Announcing the decision to form FEUOK, Dileep claimed the backing of over 100 theatre owners for the new association. The office-bearers also said that the new organisation would unite all the stakeholders in the industry and there won't be any conflict with other organisations in the industry. The new organisation has the blessing of senior actors like Mammotty and Mohanlal, they claimed.
 
 The office bearers of FEUOK said it would be a good initiative for films and there would be no incidents of shutting down of theatres in the state.
 
 A strike called by   (KFEF) headed by Liberty Basheer last month, virtually paralyzing the Malayalam film industry during Christmas led to the formation of the new organisation. The federation called for the strike demanding a change in the sharing ratio from the collection of Malayalam movies between distributors and exhibitors. No films could be released in December due to the strike. The strike was finally called off following the intervention of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.
