NEW DELHI: The   today ordered a   probe against former chief of the investigation agency   in connection with the coal block allocation scam case.

 A special bench headed by Justice M B Lokur gave its verdict based on the report by a special judicial panel, which held that prima facie there was an attempt to influence investigation into the scam by Sinha.
 
 "We are prima facie satisfied that Ranjit Sinha had abused his position as CBI director and it must be probed," the Supreme Court said.
 
 The apex court added that an independent SIT was not needed and hoped that with the change of guard in CBI, the agency would conduct fair and impartial probe against its former boss.
 
 The bench ordered CBI director   to constitute a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate Sinha and take the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) in confidence while conducting probe. It also directed Verma to suggest composition of the team and asked him to give timeline within which the probe would be completed.
 
 In the panel report, Sinha's alleged meetings with some high-profile accused in the scam were confirmed to have taken place at his residence.
 
 The apex court-appointed panel was investigating the alleged scuttling of probe into coal block allocation scam cases by Sinha, whose meetings with the accused persons were held as "completely inappropriate".
