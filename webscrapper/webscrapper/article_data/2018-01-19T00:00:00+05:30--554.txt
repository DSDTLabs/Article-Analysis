Actress   is excited about her next film Johnny Johnny   Papa this year. This is because her fans will get to see the actress dub for herself for the first time. Rachita, who has had others lend her their voice in films, is excited to see how people will respond to listening to her own voice on screen. “I’ve never had the chance to dub for myself so far. This is going to be something new, as people will get to hear me talk on screen in my own voice for the first time. This is a very glam role, I’m glad I could lend my voice for this,” says Rachita. If one recalls, many actresses have dubbed for themselves after many years of others dubbing for them, one such instance was Ramya, who happened to be the heroine of the first part of the Johnny series.
Rachita, meanwhile, is also looking forward to her uber traditional role in   opposite  . “I play a character whose dressing is a little similar to Deepika Padukone’s in  , but she is a very soft spoken girl. This is the first time I am playing a role like this,” she says.
