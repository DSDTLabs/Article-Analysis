 My active-at-81 neighbour in Sector 25, Panchkula, divides his time between India and  . On April 3, he left home to catch a flight to Toronto but landed in a hospital with blood oozing from his head. While getting inside his car outside the house, he had slipped on the loose gravel from the ongoing re-carpeting work that has left the roads dusty. He was lucky to escape with a few stitches on the head and some scrapes on his face but it could have been worse.
 
 If the municipal corporation had done an honest inspection and followed all the rules of repair, this accident wouldn’t have happened. An obstacle course for pavements, no ramps for wheelchair, dearth of lowfloor buses, poor upkeep of public toilets, rampant misuse of park benches as food stalls, missing signboards, and indifferent public officials show how little the ‘Paris of Haryana’ cares for its citizens.
 
 Even some smaller Asian cities take better care of their ageing population, and provide senior citizens with safety, health, and accessibility. The people there also get badweather warning, event updates, emotional care, and free advice, if they are lonely, poor, differently abled, ageing, or battling some mental disorder, especially.
 
 Not even Chandigarh offers any of these facilities to the aged and the infirm. The facilities are critical to the intellectual, physical, and social health of the senior citizens, and designed to integrate them into the immediate communitye.
