PANAJI: Banking services were impacted on Wednesday as public sector   and private banks began their two-day strike to protest against the two percent wage hike under the united forum of bank unions (Goa state).

 
 Employees of public sector banks and private banks, barring a few, began their strike at   on Wednesday to protest against the proposed two percent wage hike. General secretary of the Goa bank employees association, A M   said more than 4,000 bank employees of around 26 nationalized banks and 10 private banks in the state joined the nationwide strike.
 
 “A hike of two per cent after five years is very less. As we deal with money, our risk factor is very high and we pay from our own pocked the moment we make any mistake. Our job profile has also changed over the years. There is so much additional work that was earlier done by the government that we are expected to do now. We worked hard during the 2014 Jan   and during the note ban. I know of employees who have still not been paid for working overtime then. If we hadn’t cooperated with the government then, the economy would have collapsed,” Pereira said.
 
 The employees will hold indoor meetings at various centres to decide the next course of action.
