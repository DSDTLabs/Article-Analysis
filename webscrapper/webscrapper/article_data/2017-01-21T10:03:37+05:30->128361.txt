BHOPAL: A   off his father’s head after his wife stormed out of the house in   district, saying she couldn’t tolerate his chain-smoking and wouldn’t return so long as he was alive.

 The suspect,  , married only nine months ago. He was arrested on Thursday after his story fell apart during interrogation, say police.\ On Wednesday, villagers of Sonpur called police to say there was a headless body lying on the road. He was identified as 55-year-old Vishnu Yadav but police could not understand why someone would kill him. Suspicion veered to his son because his kept giving contradictory statements. Under interrogation, Dharmendra cracked and confessed to bashing his father’s head with a wooden log, strangling him as he writhed in pain, and then cutting off his head.
 
 “It would have been a difficult case to solve had I not seen the old man’s slippers in the house. They were kept neatly under the bed. I realised that his body had been dragged out and dumped,” said Brijesh Mishra, Kotwali SHO. 
 
 When Dharmendra explained his motive, police were stunned. His father was an asthma patient, yet drank and smoked heavily. His rasping smoker’s cough irritated Dharmendra’s bride. “Yadav was a chain smoker and used to light his bidis from the kitchen stove. Dharmendra’s wife, who was already annoyed with his constant coughing, didn’t like him using the stove,” said Mishra. Two weeks ago she left home in a huff.
 
 On Tuesday night, Dharmendra sent his mother to watch TV in a neighbour’s house. “Yadav was fast asleep when Dharmendra smashed his head with a heavy log. When the old man was writhing in pain he strangled him till he died,” said the SHO. 
 
 After dumping the body, Dharmendra went out and started shouting that unidentified people were beating up his father behind his house, said the officer. Police said his plan was to make it look like a robbery and mislead the investigation.
