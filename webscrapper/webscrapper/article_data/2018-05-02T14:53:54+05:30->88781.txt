TUTICORIN: The recent meeting between   chief minister Chandrasekhara Rao and DMK working president M K Stalin was not centred around the third front but was only a discussion on the rights of the states. This was stated by   MP   during her brief interaction with reporters at the Tuticorin airport on Tuesday. She added that decisions pertaining to the alliance would be taken during the elections.

 She was speaking before heading to Kanyakumari by road to take part in various events on Tuesday and Wednesday. Responding to allegations by AIADMK MP Thambidurai that the rights of the state were grabbed by the Centre during the DMK regime, she said that this had happened only when the AIADMK and not DMK was in power in Tamil Nadu. She cited the example of education that was now under the control of the Centre.
 
 Later, talking to reporters at Nagercoil, the Rajya Sabha MP said that during his tenure as chief minister, M Karunanidhi had addressed the just demands of the working force even before they asked. She added that that workers and farmers were now forced to beg if their demands have to be met. Kanimozhi expressed confidence that DMK would soon come to power and a government that respected the people, working class and farmers would come to power in the state and Centre. She added that a government and a Prime Minister that gave Tamil Nadu and other states the respect they deserved should come to power at the Centre.
