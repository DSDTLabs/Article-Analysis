BENGALURU: If the   discussion on April 7 about the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill 2016 is any indication,   may soon get more powers to crack down on   Members not only backed the   for booking underage drunk drivers under the Juvenile Justice Act but also action against parents of such drivers. 

  Bengaluru police have already been summoning parents of underage drivers and riders caught doing wheelies, stoppies and other stunts on the roads. They are now hopeful that the MPs' recommendations will be implemented and arm them to act against errant drivers. The existing provisions under the Motor Vehicles Act penalize the owner or person in charge of the vehicle for allowing an unauthorized person such as a minor or someone without a licence to drive. The offence carries a maximum fine of Rs 1,000 and jail for three months or both. 
 
 According to senior officers, it was only in one case in recent times that they filed a case against a minor's parent. After PU student Shiny Kiran was killed on September 1, 2016, when she fell off from her friend's bike when he was performing stunts, police booked the rider for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. A minor who provided the motorcycle to the dead girl's friend was tracked down and his father was booked on charges on abetment to culpable homicide. The minor, though, was not booked in the case. Police commissioner Praveen Sood said though a provision is available for booking parents of minors on charges on negligence, the amendments proposed would be a more effective deterrent in their efforts to crack down on underage drivers.
