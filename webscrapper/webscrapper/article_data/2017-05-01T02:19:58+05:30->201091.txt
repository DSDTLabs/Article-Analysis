NEW DELHI: A 60-year-old owner of a jewellery workshop in central Delhi’s Beadonpura was smothered inside his shop on Sunday night. His head was also repeatedly hit on the ground, leading to fatal injuries. No jewellery has gone missing and the police suspect some of his employees to be involved in the murder. 

 Around 9pm, a help of Ravinder Kapoor called the Karol Bagh police station and said someone had murdered his employer and fled after locking the door of the shop from outside. 
 
 A police team found Kapoor lying on the floor with a cloth around his mouth. His hands were tied with another cloth. 
 
 Prima facie investigations suggest that the killers were known to him. Sources said one of the killers might have initially tried to strangle Kapoor from behind which led to a scuffle. The killers then smothered the elderly man with the cloth, tied his hands and also hit his head on the ground.
 
 Kapoor owned several workshops designing jewellery for many shops in Karol Bagh. Being a Sunday, the shop was empty except for a few helps assisting Kapoor in official work. Employees and neighbours said Kapoor usually kept the door of his shop shut on Sundays. 
 
 The police are scanning the CCTV footage of the shop and have detained the help who had called them. Some inconsistencies have been found in his statements, they said. A few other people are also being questioned. 
 
 A murder case has been registered. Kapoor’s body will be handed over to the family on Monday after an autopsy.
