PATNA: Recent spurt in incidents of crime against women has underlined afresh the need to train women in self- defence.

 “We plan to run regular classes to teach martial arts to our students... We will engage special trainers for the purpose,”   principal Shashi Sharma told this reporter on Thursday and recalled several such classes were conducted a year ago, but the same could not be continued due to certain unavoidable reasons.
 
 According to   Women’s College ( ) student Komal Kirti, her college organises occasional counselling and training sessions to train girls to raise voice against exploitation. “Such sessions help us prepare ourselves to thwart any such bid,” she said.
 
 PWC teacher Shefali Roy believes “candle march, sit-in, social media posts etc can do little to prevent incidents of sexual attack on women. “In our college, we had taekwondo classes for students, albeit not regular,” Roy said and added the college would organise regular classes to train students in self-defence from the academic session 2018-19.
 
 “We will also conduct personality development classes to boost the confidence of our students and theoretical classes to give them basic knowledge about rape laws,” she said.
 
 Certain schools also conduct self-defence classes. A teacher of city’s St Michael's High School said yoga and self-defence were part of Physical Education for his school’s students. “We conduct two classes — one each for boys and girls — where they are taught self-defence techniques like karate,” the teacher said.
 
 This reporter also spoke with BN College principal Raj Kishore, Patna Science College principal U K Sinha and Patna Law College principal Rakesh Verma, who too felt the need to train female students in self-defence in these times.
