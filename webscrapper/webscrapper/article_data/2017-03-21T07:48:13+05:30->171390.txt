CHENNAI: The dive into the pool, the will to reach the finish line and memories of a medal, bring out the best in 25-year-old  . Silver and bronze medallist in swimming at the Special Olympics 2013 ­ Regional Games, in Australia, Krishnamoorthy is first an athlete and then a person with Down's Syndrome.

 Introduced to the sport 15 years ago, the girl from Besant Nagar, who was refused regular academic education by institutions, has learned that public perception doesn't matter when it comes to achievements. “The sport has been the most inclusive field where people are given a fair chance and judged on their ability .She trains with children and adults at Velachery swimming complex and is treated as an equal, “says Sandhya, Arti's mother and coordinator at   Federation of India, Chennai branch.
 
 Swimming, which started as a hobby , turned therapeutic and before long Arti was training for her first state meet in 2007. It was her coach at the Down's syndrome centre, Veerabhadra, who picked her out of a group of children to take up swimming. “It is remarkable how she overcame her fear of water. In the water she has become more disciplined,“ says Sandhya who has been inspired by her daughter to become a Special Olympics coach herself, despite her fear of water.
 
 Ask Arti about what she thinks about when in the water and she quips, “I want to be first“. But she takes her titles lightly as there are more feats to be conquered like the national Paralympic meet in Jaipur this weekend and the next Special Olympics.
