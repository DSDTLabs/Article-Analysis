April 30: Five persons were killed and one was injured when a tempo hit them on the   around 4am.

 May 22: A 39-year-old tempo driver died when his vehicle rammed a truck from rear along the steep gradient near Amrutanjan bridge 
 
 Security personnel manning the Pune-Mumbai expressway are concerned over the recent rise in accidents because of vehicles ramming others, particularly during small hours. 
 
 
  
 
 The April 30   was a result of speeding. Eight people were travelling to Pune in a van, when the vehicle broke down in Panvel. They were pushing the van to the Mumbai-side of the carriageway, when the tempo mowed them down.
 
 Highway Safety Patrol (HSP) inspector Dattatreya Gadhave said, “Over 70% of the accidents along the highway occur due to human errors. If people follow the speed limits and stick to the lane norms, the number of accidents on the expressway will considerably reduce.”
 
 The other factors HSP officials cite for the accidents are the drivers’ lack of control on their vehicles at a high speed, poor maintenance of tyres and halting on the expressway. 
 
 Superintendent of police (HSP) Amol Tambe said, “The police have taken up most of the issues with the authorities concerned to reduce fatalities on the expressway.”
 
 An HSP officer said a study found that most accidents occur early in the morning, between 3am and 6am, when the drivers are sleepy. 
 
 A senior HSP officer said, “Small cars often travel at 120kmph, or above. At such speed, it becomes extremely difficult to control the vehicles.” To drive home his point, he cited a recent example of a car moving towards Mumbai at such high speed that the driver lost control over the vehicle. It hit the metal crash barrier. “The crash barrier had cut through the vehicle — from the car’s engine to the driver’s seat. He died on the spot. His kin escaped with injuries,” he said.
