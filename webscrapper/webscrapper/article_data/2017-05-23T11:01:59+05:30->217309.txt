VISAKHAPATNAM: Director general of police (DGP) N Sambasiva Rao visited the   (AUCE) Grounds on Monday to inspect the security arrangements for the upcoming three-day   by TDP.

 Addressing the media at the venue, the DGP said there are two main challenges —   security and protocol. “We will deploy more number of policemen in mufti to handle both the issues. Traffic is another issue that we are concentrating on. The roads leading to the venue are a bit narrow and we are working on how to handle the traffic and parking,” Sambasiva Rao said.
 
 The DGP further said they do not rule out the possibility of Maoist threat during the mega event. “We will deploy action teams and also set up check posts at various strategic points in the city. Both the city and district police are working in tandem on this issue,” he added.
 
 Speaking on the murder of   constituency in-charge Cherukulapadu Narayana Reddy and his aide  , the DGP said it was an unfortunate incident and assured that the real culprits will be arrested soon.
 
 “Reddy had submitted an application for renewal of his gun licence after it expired on March 31. But it was delayed. We will probe as to why it was not processed promptly. But there is no doubt that it was a factional killing,” the DGP said.
