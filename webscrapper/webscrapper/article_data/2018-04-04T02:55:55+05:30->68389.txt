NEW DELHI: The   ( ) failed to recover losses to the tune of Rs 5.9 crore due to inefficient contract management after 17 of its buses were burnt in a fire, reveals a report tabled by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the Delhi assembly. 

 The 17 buses, which cost Rs 10.3 crore, had a depreciated value of Rs. 5.9 crore when these got burnt in a fire at the   depot of DTC on January 1, 2015. The buses were parked in the depot at the time of the fire. A Delhi government committee concluded that there was no malafide action behind the cause of the fire, even though the exact cause couldn't be ascertained.
 
 Under a contract signed between DTC and   in October 2008, the latter supplied 2,682 low floor buses to the corporation between 2007 and 2011. The contract included a clause that stipulated that Tata Motors Limited would take adequate insurance cover for the buses in its custody for maintenance, including those parked in the depots.
 
 The audit report, however, noted that DTC authorities did not ensure that Tata Motors Limited had taken the required insurance cover for the 2,682 low floor buses.
