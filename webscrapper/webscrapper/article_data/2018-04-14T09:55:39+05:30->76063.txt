MYSURU: Pointing to the availability of free treatment for patients suffering from  , Karnataka's blood cell nodal officer Dr   on Friday said, "No patient in   will face problems since medicines are available at all district hospitals across the state." 

 Bankar, who was at the   organised by the   chapter of the Haemophilia Society, said, "Regardless of an individual's economic status - whether one is from the below poverty line (BPL) or not - treatment and medicines will be made available to all."
 
 Bankar said that there were more than 2,400 people in the state suffering from the rare bleeding disorder. "When the society was started, there were only 1,000 reported cases of haemophilia," he said. In Mysuru district, there are around 150 people suffering from the rare disorder. 
 
  Emphasising the need to prevent haemophilia, he said, "We are keeping a constant watch on the foetus in the case of either the mother or father suffering from the condition. If the foetus shows the strain of haemophilia, then an abortion is advised." 
 
 Lamenting the lack of experience among doctors in the state to treat the disorder, Bankar added, "This is particularly true of doctors in Kodagu and   districts."
 
 Highlighting the need to spread awareness about the disorder, haemophilia patient and chairman of the South India Regional Council of Haemophilia Premroop Alva said, "One in 5,000 people suffer from the disorder, but the state has recorded just 2,400 cases, which cannot be accurate. e. Haemophilia remains undiagnosed in most people."
