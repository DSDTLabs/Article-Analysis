BENGALURU: The results of the bypolls held for the Nanjangud and Gundlupet assembly segments might have brought little cheer to the  , which suffered huge losses in both seats, but a closer look at the   for the party in the two constituencies indicates that it has made significant gains in the   bastions.

 Information on the vote share in both the constituencies released by the Election Commission indicates that both the BJP and the Congress improved their vote share percentage in comparison to the 2013 elections. However, the equations alter dramatically, if one factors the JD(S), which did not contest the bypolls. 
 
 In the 2013 elections, Karnataka witnessed a multi-cornered contest in the aftermath of former chief minister   and B Sriramulu quitting the BJP and floating separate outfits. Data from the 2013 elections indicate that the BJP-KJP-BSR combine polled 36,172 votes in Nanjangud. No longer a divided house, the BJP nearly doubled its tally in the bypoll at Nanjangud, with V   polling 64,878 votes.
 
 Although the Congress increased its vote share from 50,784 in 2013 (when Prasad fought as a Congress candidate) to 86,212, the absence of JD(S) from the fray – the party polled 41,483 votes in 2013 – must be considered before one is overwhelmed by the victory margin.
 
 The BJP hoped to ride on Prasad’s popularity among dalits, which it appeared to have overestimated, to victory in the bypolls. Moreover, in 2013, Yeddyurappa’s KJP outperformed the BJP, bagging 28,000 votes. The saffron party’s calculations of Prasad retaining his base among dalits, coupled with KJP’s impressive performance in 2013, to guide them to a win at Nanjangud were proven wrong on Thursday.
 
 The numbers follow a similar pattern in Gundlupet. Where the BJP-KJP-BSR unit tallied 69,236 votes in 2013, fighting as a single entity this year, the BJP polled 79,381 votes. Meanwhile, the Congress managed to increase its vote share by just 6% (from 73,723 to 90,258 votes).
 
 The numbers clearly indicate that the decision of the JD(S) to stay away benefitted the Congress. Political observers point out that the sharp rise in BJP’s vote share in these Congress citadels carries greater import than the twin victories.
