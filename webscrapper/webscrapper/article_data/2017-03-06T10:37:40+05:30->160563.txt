BENGALURU: Nearly 800 people from all walks of life gathered in front of   on   at 9am Sunday to speak up for the steel flyover. 

 "The cancellation of the steel flyover project was a shock for us. We've been waiting for a solution to our traffic woes for a long time. It takes nearly 2 hours to travel 2kms from Esteem Mall to Hebbal. Ours is not a politically motivated request, we just want to travel seamlessly," said Dr  , a resident of north Bengaluru.
 
 Homemakers, college students, techies, school kids and senior citizens gathered for the protest organized by the North Bengaluru Residents' Associations.
 
 "The government has done a sudden U-turn because of certain allegations made by the opposition recently. After withdrawing the plan, it should come up with an alternative. We never demanded a steel flyover -- that was the government's solution. We don't care about cement or steel; the pollution and traffic problems have to be solved. This will help those going to the airport also. Influential people took up the cause against the steel flyover and blocked it. For differences between parties, the people shouldn't suffer," said Devarajappa, president,  , a consortium of RWAs of north Bengaluru.
 
 Residents claim they tried to solve the problem in their own way. "We have started pooling our resources but not much is possible at that level. We'll submit memorandums to the chief minister, governor and Bengaluru development minister," said Dr Samuel.
 
 The consortium plans to plant 5,000 saplings in the near future and compensate for the trees that would have been cut for the flyover. "We just want an alternative that will provide better connectivity," he added.
