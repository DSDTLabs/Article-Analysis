Coimbatore: At a medical education programme held in a city hospital, women and doctors were cautioned not to dismiss heavy   during   lightly, as it could help in detecting endometrial cancers.

 Speaking on the topic ‘Update on Endometrium’ conducted at Kovai Medical Centre and Hospital, the hospital’s gynaecologic oncologists, Dr Anbukkani Subbian, said, “the take-home message from the program is that clinicians need to have a high index of suspicion to abnormal bleeding during menstruation, which will help to detect and treat precancerous conditions leading to endometrial cancers.” She added, “Current management options for cancers in the uterus are well outlined and they need to be offered to patients suffering from the disease by oncologists.” 
 
 The cause for heavy bleeding during menstruation can be hormonal disturbances or benign cyst to something really serious like uterine cancer. “Uterine  , although not common as cervical or breast cancers, are slowly on the rise among Indian women,” said Dr Subbian.
 
 The event was also attended by Professor Janesh Kumar Gupta from UK and a few other experts from abroad.
