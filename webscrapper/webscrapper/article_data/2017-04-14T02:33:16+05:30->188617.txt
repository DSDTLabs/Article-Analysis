KOLKATA: The   retailers and bar owners on the state highways got some respite on Thursday as the   said it would hear the special leave petition (SLP) after the summer vacation. The petition was filed against the denotification of some stretches along highways by several state governments, allowing liquor vendors to operate on the same premises. West Bengal, too, has denotified 280-km-long municipal stretches of state highways on March 16.

 The apex court has banned liquor vending within 500m of national and state highways in municipal areas and 220m in areas where population is less than 20,000. Most shops on the state highways reopened on Thursday after the news. A bar owner in Chandernagore said, “We opened after fulfilling the government’s conditions.”
 
 Foreign Liquor Association’s Nadia secretary, Mihir Chakraborty, is not very optimistic. “Yes, we have got three months’ time you can say,” he added.
 
 There are 2,140 off shops within the SC-specified limit on highways in West Bengal, out of which 1,500 are on the state highways. Around 700 shops got breather after the denotification. These shops employ over 15,000 persons and generate at least above Rs 1,000 crore revenue for the state. A major chunk of the 5,500 liquor outlets in the state are on the highways. The state government mopped up Rs 4,100 crore from excise last year. The state liquor industry is worth Rs 23,000 crore.
