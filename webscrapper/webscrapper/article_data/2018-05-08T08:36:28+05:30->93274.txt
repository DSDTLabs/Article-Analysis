CHENNAI: At least 7,000   in state-run medical colleges will be re-designated or promoted as per Medical Council India rules and nomenclature by month-end, director of medical education A Edwin Joe announced here on Monday.

 The Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association had told health secretary J Radhakrishnan and Dr Joe that associate   would not pose as professors during   inspections for renewal of permission. For five years, associate doctors were misrepresented as professors to renew ‘permission’ for continuing   courses in many colleges despite 50% vacancies in professor posts, they said. More than 500 of the 1,020 professor posts are vacant.
 
 A team of doctors officially handed over the representation to officials and told reporters the fraud won’t recur even if it means state medical colleges losing recognition.
 
 Dr Joe said they had been working on redesignating teaching faculty for nearly a month. “We found that even at entry level there were many variations in  . While some MBBS doctors were called tutors, some were called demonstrators,” he said. At the senior level associate professors were also called readers.
 
  were also time bound. After a year, tutors/demonstrators were re-designated junior residents and three years later were made assistant professors if in non-clinical stream or senior residents if in clinical stream. The MCI has now said on doctors with a PG degree can get promotions.
 
 The process for promotions was halted five years ago when anomalies were found in several promotions. “We have prepared a revised list and sent it to the health department for approval,” he said.
