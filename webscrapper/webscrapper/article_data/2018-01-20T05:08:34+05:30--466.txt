Actress   says 'Veer', featuring superstar  , was a dream debut for her.

 "Salman is somebody who will always be very dear, special and very close to my heart because if not for him, I had never thought of becoming a part of this industry. I would have never been a part of this industry because this was not my plan and now I am here. The debut I got was a dream debut for me,"   told   over phone from Mumbai. 
 
 The actress, 30, worked with the 'Dabangg' star in 'Ready' too. She remains grateful to him.
 
 "I know a lot of people who grow up with a dream of becoming an actor and leave their homes and come to Bombay (Mumbai) with this dream of fulfilling this passion. But unfortunately, this dream of theirs is never fulfilled...   is somebody whom I always respect. I am very thankful to him... He has already done a lot for me," she added.
