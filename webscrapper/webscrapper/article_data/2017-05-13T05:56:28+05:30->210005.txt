ROHTAK: A   on Friday issued a   against   in a case related to his controversial   in the city during ‘Sadbhawna Sammelan’ in 2016. The order followed the failure of Ramdev to appear before the court despite the summons issued to him for April 29.

 Ramdev was summoned under Section 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the IPC for his remark that he could “behead lakhs of people refusing to chant ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ if he weren’t bound by the law”.
 
 He was addressing a large gathering in Rohtak, organized to diffuse the tension in the riot-hit state after the 2016 Jat agitation for reservation turned violent. He had triggered immediate controversy with his statement and received flak from various quarters, including opposition political leaders.
 
 Taking offence at the statement, former Haryana home minister and Congress leader Subhash Batra had lodged a complaint with police against Ramdev. Batra later moved court after the police did not register a case.
 
 The court had on March 2 summoned Ramdev for April 29, but he failed to make an appearance.
 
 The court of additional chief judicial magistrate (ACJM) Harish Goyal directed Ramdev to furnish Rs 1 lakh in personal surety during the execution of the warrant and also to appear before the court on June 14. Confirming the development, Batra told media, “A bailable warrant has been issued against Ramdev today.” Senior Supreme Court lawyer R K Anand had argued the case recently on behalf of the complainant.
