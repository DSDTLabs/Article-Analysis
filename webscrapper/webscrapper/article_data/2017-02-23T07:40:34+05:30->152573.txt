KOLKATA: A sub-inspector of   probing into the   was suspended on Wednesday after special branch officers submitted a report highlighting a nexus between the officer and the promoter behind the February 18 incident. 

 On Saturday around 1am, a group of 80 miscreants led by promoter Mizanur Rahman broke into Lilavati Memorial Institute at Dashadrone in Rajarhat. They razed down the walls and roof of the school. Further, they thrashed the teachers and fled before the cops arrived.
 
 Sub-inspector Tamal Sarkar had started working at the station barely a month ago. Before that he was associated with the detective department of Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate.
 
 According to a police source, days after chief minister Mamata Banerjee spoke tough against the vandalism and asked for a detailed enquiry, the special branch submitted evidence including a CCTV footage that shows Sarkar meeting Rahman a day before the incident. The source claimed Sarkar met Rahman, without the knowledge of the inspector in-charge.
 
 A senior officer confirmed his suspension saying, "A departmental enquiry has been initiated against Sarkar and he cannot join office till the report is submitted and further order is given."
 
 When Bidhannagar mayor Sabyasachi Datta visited the school on Sunday, he openly spoke about the the nexus. "I heard some officers from the police department are directly associated with the case," he said.
 
 After Sarkar's role was questioned, the Bidhannagar commissioner handed over the case to the detective department.
 
 Meanwhile, Buddhadeb Das - a local Trinamool leader and an aide of Rahman - was nabbed from Chinar Park on Wednesday.
