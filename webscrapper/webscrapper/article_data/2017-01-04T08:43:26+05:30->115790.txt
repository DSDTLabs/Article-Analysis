KOLKATA: " " seems to be the word of the season, and not surprisingly, has caught on in the   world as well. 

 "Mitro Ke Niye Ki Korite Hoibe" is a new Bengali play set to be performed at   on January 15, the choice of the title being a deliberate act of making a political statement, as asserted by actor-director Joyraj Bhattacharya. He will also pronounce "mitro" in a nasal tone. 
 
 Both meaning "friend", the Bengali word, "mitro" is phonetically similar to "mitron", a term often used by the Prime Minister in his speeches. 
 
 The Bengali production is based on a Marathi play by Rajeev Naik that has, on the face of it, a rather straight narrative of a couple, ad film-maker Abhay and his professor wife Salma. Extremely jealous of an acclaimed documentary filmmaker, Sathe, Abhay is obsessed with proving the atrocity of his works. While Bhattacharya will play Abhay, Daminee Benny Basu will essay Salma's role. When Bhattacharya adapted the play into the current context of Bengal, he made some changes: "I understand the significance the word, 'mitro', has in today's society. We changed the documentary filmmaker's surname from Sathe to Mitro. Salma tells Abhay not to be jealous but to concentrate on his work. But he doesn't relent. Though he addresses the docu-maker 'Mitro', he sees him as a rival. From a term referring to endearment, 'Mitro' sounds like a warning."
 
 Does he realise that dropping such hints might land him in trouble? Bhattacharya said he had always wanted to speak against intolerance and fundamentalism. "The original Marathi play was staged in Mumbai when Shiv Sena was at the height of power. We are definitely hitting out at the current political scene. Abhay is so self-obsessed that he only listens to his own sentiments... Even if he addresses someone as a friend, he doesn't mean it. I am not scared of consequences..." he said.
