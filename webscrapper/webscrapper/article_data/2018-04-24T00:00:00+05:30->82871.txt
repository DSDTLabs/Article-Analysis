After working with   in Pannaiyarum Padminiyum and Sethupathi,   is all set to direct the actor in his next as well. The yet-to-be-titled film, which has   playing the female lead and   composing the music, will go on floors from next month.Ask Arun why he chose to cast Vijay Sethupathi in his third film as well, and he says with a laugh, “Actually, I didn’t write the script keeping   in mind. I’d approached a few artistes and had almost finalised another actor for the lead. But things didn’t materialise and I went back to Sethu. He was happy to come on board.”The director says that he shares a great rapport with Vijay Sethupathi and that makes it easier for them to work together. “There’s a huge comfort factor, and in fact, that’s one of the reasons why we didn’t want to work together again. We wanted to break away from that. But now that we are teaming up again, I’m glad this film happened. I really don’t have to extract any kind of work from him because he knows what a scene demands,” he says.
While Arun isn’t ready to reveal much about the lead actors’ characterisation, he says, “We will start filming from the second half of May, and shoot will happen in Thenkasi and Malaysia.”
