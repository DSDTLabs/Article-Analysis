Vadodara: A non-cognizable (NC) offence was registered by Padra police after a statue of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar was found broken at Sejakuva village on Sunday.

 Dalit community of the village went to Padra police station and insisted that an FIR be lodged against unidentified miscreants. They alleged that some miscreant from the village was repeatedly indulging in the act of damaging the statue to hurt their sentiments.
 
 Police officials went to the village and took statements of other residents too. A police official said that their investigation revealed that the statue was damaged on Sunday after a monkey jumped on it. The police registered an NC after the dalits were adamant that an FIR be registered.
 
 “We talked with residents who have their houses near the statue and also with those who saw a monkey jumping on it. All of them said that the statue was damaged as the monkey jumped on it therefore we registered an NC instead of an FIR,” said M K Swami, police inspector, Padra police station.
