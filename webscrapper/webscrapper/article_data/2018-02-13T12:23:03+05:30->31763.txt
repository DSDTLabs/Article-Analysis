The Mahashivratri celebrations of the Saptakoteshwar temple, situated amidst the lush green fields of Narvem,  , traces its history back to more than a thousand years, right to the   era.

 Narvem was earlier known as Hindole. The etymology of the present name finds its roots in Naroa of Divar islands. How a permanent association came to be made between the Saptakoteshwar temple of erstwhile Hindole and Naroa of Divar makes for an interesting recounting. 
 
 History traces the connection between the Saptakoteshwar temple and Goa to the Kadamba dynasty. Inscription found on coins from the Kadamba era refer to Saptakoteshwar as the family deity of the royal family. And it was the Kadamba kings who are credited with constructing the Saptakoteshwar temple in Naroa, on the island of Divar. 
 
 Later, when during the Portuguese regime the temple was endangered, devotees brought the Shivlinga first to Latambarcem in Bicholim and then to the erstwhile Hindole in Bicholim, where it was reconsecrated on the right side of the Mandovi river. And where it continues to stand till date.
 
 Local folklore, however, has a different take on the Divar and Lord Shiva connect. It is said that sages performed penance for seven crore years to get a vision of Lord Shiva and that when the lord did finally appear before them, as a boon, they requested him to stay permanently on the island of Dipavati, today known as Divar.
 
 Mahashivratri is celebrated on the 13th day of the 11th month of the lunar calendar — the Hindu month of Magh. The festivity finds cultural and religious significance throughout the Indian sub-continent and, in Goa, on this auspicious night various folk dance troupes begin rehearsals for their shigmo performances. 
 
 “This historic temple attracts a large number of devotees, especially during Mahashivratri,”   from Bicholim says.
