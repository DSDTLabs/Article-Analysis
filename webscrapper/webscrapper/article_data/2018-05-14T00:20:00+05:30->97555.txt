Visakhapatnam: Perhaps taking a cue from the Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb, who last month said that internet existed during Mahabharat period, two persons have been convicted for cheating a man by selling him a fake ‘Ramayan-era’ gold coin.

 Mamidi Arjuna Rao and Adi Shankar Rao, residents of Allipuram, were sentenced to two years in prison and fined Rs 20,000 by the second additional chief metropolitan magistrate Shammi Paravana Sultana Begum. 
 
 According to assistant public prosecutor K Sudha Rani, both Shankar Rao and Arjuna Rao sold a gold coin to Jogana Nagi Reddy in December 2014, claiming that it belonged to the ‘Ramayan era’. Reddy paid Rs 20,000 for the coin. 
 
 Later, when Reddy realised his mistake he filed a complaint with the police.
