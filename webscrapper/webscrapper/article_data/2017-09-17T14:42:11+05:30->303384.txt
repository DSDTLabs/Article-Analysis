* Let us leave no stone unturned in creating a 'New India' by 2022, when we mark 75 years of India's freedom

 *   faced so many obstacles. But, we were determined that the project will go on
 
 * We specially remember two people today, Sardar Patel and Dr. Ambedkar, who as Minister gave great emphasis to irrigation & waterways
 
 * Lack of water resources has been a major factor in slowing the pace of development
 
 * I still remember, as chief minister when I went to border areas I saw BSF jawans do not have water. We brought   waters to borders for jawans
 
 * The saints and seers of   have played a very big role in the making of the Sardar Sarovar Dam as well. When the   refused to give us funds, it was the temples of Gujarat that offered money
 
 * There have been many conspiracies to stall the project. But it was never a political issue to us
 
 Sardar Sarovar Dam project will change the fortunes of the farmers of not only Gujarat, but Maharashtra,   and   as well
 
 * The waters of Maa Narmada will help several citizens and transform several lives
 
 * The western part of India lacks adequate water supply, in the eastern part there is shortage of electricity & gas supply. We are working to overcome these shortages so that both parts of India development and India scales new heights of development
 
 * The 'Statue of Unity' will be a fitting tribute to Sardar Patel and will draw tourists from all over. It will be double the height of America's famed Statue of Liberty
