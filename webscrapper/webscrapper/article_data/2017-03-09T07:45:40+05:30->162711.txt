KALPETTA: A 23-year-old Sunday school teacher—also the coordinator of the Kerala Catholic Youth Movement’s Manathavadi diocese committee—was on Wednesday arrested on charges of raping and impregnating a Class XII student.

 The student, aged 17, gave birth to a baby girl at a private hospital in   two months ago. The infant has since then been under the care of a convent in Kozhikode city.
 
 Police said the suspect, Sijo George, 23, of Mathissery in Mananthavady, exploited the girl several times on promise of marriage.
 
 Investigators said the youth started interacting with the girl frequently after she had performed well in the SSLC examination two years ago. 
 
 He allegedly misused his position as a religious teacher and adviser to sexually misuse.
 
 He reportedly took the teenager to the private hospital in Kozhikode after she had got pregnant, to cover-up the issue. Later, he shifted the new-born to a convent, saying he would marry the girl, but her parents opposed the proposal.
 
 Kalpetta DSP Muhammed Shafi K said the man was arrested based on a tipoff. The accused had confided the matter to the vicar of a Mananthavady church on March 3.
 
 “We will investigate the role of the hospital and convent in covering up the issue,” the officer said.
 
 Police said in a statement that George was arrested under relevant sections of the IPC and Pocso Act.
 
 Incidentally, a vicar was arrested a week ago for impregnating a minor girl at   in Kannur.
