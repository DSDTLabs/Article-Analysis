CHANDIGARH: For five years, the residents of Sector 51 have struggled for street lights on a 4-kilometre dark-spot V5 road. The civic authorities concerned have ignored repeated complaints.

 Residents want the authorities concerned to develop this cleared land of erstwhile Colony Number 5 slum to contain the assembling of criminal activities over there. “We are tired asking for street lights but have not seen any action upon the complaints,” Sector-51 residents A   said. “During its last term, the municipal corporation had sanctioned Rs 25 lakh for the installation of these lights.”
 
 During a visit to Sector 51, a team from   found big gaps in the barbed-wire fence around the vacated site, created for intrusion. Cleared grass suggested that illegal entrants had been using that patch of land, which the residents have reported to the authorities concerned many times.
 
  general secretary   said: “Even though the civic authorities fenced the vacant area to make it out of bounds, outsiders breach the fence at late hours and gather on the spot for public drinking sessions. This area has become a crime zone for want of police supervision. My housing society got the wild grass over this land cleared for the safety its residents, as miscreants used to hide in there. However, it hasn’t stopped drunkards from assembling in there and creating nuisance.
