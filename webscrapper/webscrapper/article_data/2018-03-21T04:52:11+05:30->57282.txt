The   by   was not spontaneous but a well planned protest, a high ranking IPS officer said. “Most of the agitating apprentices were out of Mumbai,’’ the IPS officer pointed out. A veteran trade union leader endorsed the officer’s views saying, it appears that the apprentices had formed a WhatsApp group for communication among themselves. “I feel that at least a month ago, they must have decided to launch an agitation in Mumbai to press for their demand for employment. A section of activists must have taken a lead in the formation of the group for coordinating among the apprentices across the country’’ he said. The IPS officer said law enforcing agencies were taken by surprise when over 1000 job seekers gathered near Matunga station in the wee hours of Tuesday.
