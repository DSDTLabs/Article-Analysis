SURAT: The city is gripped by mosquito menace for past five days, a regular phenomenon in March and April every year. 

 The problem is severe in Rander, Adajan, Athwa, Udhna and   areas. 
 
 Surat Municipal Corporation’s (SMC) health department and vector-borne disease control (VBDC) department officials said there has been increase in the density of mosquitoes but disease transmission remained low in the city. Maximum mosquitoes are found to be originating from stagnant waters of creeks, stormwater and drainage networks in the city. 
 
 “Mosquito breeding could be taking place at the centre of the river where there is lot of fresh stagnant water and vegetation,” said an official of the SMC’s health department. 
 
 “We have identified 59 spots and started anti-larval operations to destroy them through fogging and other means,” SMC chief health officer Dr   said. 
 
 Dr Vikas Desai, director,   and Climate Resilience Centre (UHCRC), Surat, said: “The prevailing humidity and temperature were not conducive for malaria and dengue causing mosquitoes, but their larvae can set off vector-borne diseases in the city with climate change.”
