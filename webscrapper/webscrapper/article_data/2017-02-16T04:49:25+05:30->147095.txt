MUMBAI:   Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has raised the flag on the overbooking of flights by airlines, and urged the civil aviation ministry and the director general of civil aviation (DGCA) to formulate guidelines to prevent the harassment of passengers refused boarding despite having confirmed seats. 

 The ruling came as the commission awarded compensation to a passenger denied travel on an   flight. “The policy to take care of such passengers and make arrangements to book them on alternative flights in the shortest possible time is opaque and no clear-cut guidelines are available on the subject,” the commission said on Monday. 
 
 Kolkata-based Radha Kejriwal, who was studying in the UK, was denied boarding on a   flight on December 9, 2009, on the grounds that she arrived 70 minutes before departure instead of the stipulated 75 minutes. The commission, however, observed that the flight was overbooked and two others who arrived after her were accommodated. The commission ordered the airline to pay the flier a compensation of 600 euros (Rs 42,300) under guidelines applicable to the European Union. The commission also directed it to reimburse Rs 82,000, the amount spent on booking an alternative flight.
