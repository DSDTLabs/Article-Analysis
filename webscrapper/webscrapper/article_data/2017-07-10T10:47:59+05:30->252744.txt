THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Administrative reforms commission chairman V S Achuthanandan has said that those opposing the   at the   seem to have some questionable intentions in taking such a stand. 

 "If some people are afraid of the opening of the vault, then they should be put under scanner," he said.
 
 He flayed the members of the royal family for their stand on the issue. "Some of them are opposing it as if they know that divine will is against the opening," said Achuthanandan.
 
 There is no record in history of the divine will being sought when the same vault was opened many years ago. This means that it is not the divine will that matters but the personal will of some people, he said.
 
 Royal families do not have any significance in the post-Independence scenario. Hence it would not be proper for the royal family or its members to interfere in the administration of the Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple, he said.
 
 This has been made clear by the division bench of the Kerala high court in 2011 and by the Thiruvananthapuram principal sub-court in 2007. That was why none of the royal family members were included in the present temple administration committee, he added.
 
 The vault should be opened under the supervision of the   and a proper evaluation of its contents should be carried out. In the report submitted by  , it has been clearly mentioned that the B-vault has been opened before, said Achuthanandan.
 
 "It is surprising that the royal family is against the opening of the vaults. Those who wants to protect the assets of the temple should support the evaluation of the assets, instead of opposing it," said the former chief minister.
