New Delhi: A grocery shop owner was caught on video molesting an 11-year-old girl who had come to his shop to buy cooking oil on Tuesday afternoon. His crime was taped on a mobile phone and the video clip circulated by a youth to spite the girl’s father, with whom he had a property dispute. Both the men have been arrested.

 Police were informed about the video clip on Wednesday morning after it was uploaded on a social media platform. In the clip,  , 67, the grocery shop owner, is first seen trying to touch the girl and on her resisting him, refusing to sell her oil. When the girl insists, Kishan asks her to follow him to the back of the shop and starts touching her inappropriately. The girl appears terrified but does not raise an alarm due to fear.
 
 “We verified the video clip and realised that the shopkeeper as well as the person who shot the video were guilty,” said  , DCP (South). 
 
 “The latter had circulated the video among local residents to defame the child’s father. We have arrested them both and registered cases against them.” Police officers said they have sent out an advisory in the area to desist from circulating the video.
 
 Police discovered that the man who shot the video was a distant relative of the girl and had wanted to create problems for the father. So, despite having the means to stop Kishan from molesting the child, he had chosen to film the crime. 
 
 The girl has been sent for counselling after she went into shock at the video going online.
