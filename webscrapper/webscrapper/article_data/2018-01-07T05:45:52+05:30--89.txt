The  , which dismissed four engineers in connection with the first phase of the road scam, hasdropped charges against four others. 

 The four who have got a reprieve are deputy chief engineers M D Machiwal and S M Jadhav, assistant engineer SM Sonawane and sub-engineer Prashant Palwe. Sanjay Darade, chief engineer in the development plan department who was earlier in the road department, is reportedly among the 100 named in the first phase. 
 
 About the stringent action taken, civic chief Ajoy Mehta told TOI, “This is the first time such stern action has been taken. We wanted to ensure that punishments awarded are commensurate with the loss caused. It should serve as a lesson that action will be taken in such cases.” 
 
  
  
  
 
 In his order, he said, “From the report, it is seen that not only has the public suffered losses but a large number of engineers are involved. The malaise and rot runs deep. There is a need to strike at this rot with exemplary punishment. Those whose role was limited were given punishment as per their negligence. It was important to impose punishment prudently and based on a fair and transparent mechanism.” 
 
  leader in BMC Rais Shaikh has demanded that photos of blacklisted contractors be displayed at the BMC office entrance to restrict their entry. 
 
 “Officials are now concealing information about recovery from the blacklisted contractors,” he said. 
 
 The scam came to the light in 2015 when Mehta appointed a committee to probe into the roads repaired in the previous three years. After inspecting 34 roads in the first phase, the committee submitted a preliminary report saying work on almost all the roads was shoddy. 
 
 The BMC registered an FIR against the contractors and in June 2016 a special investigation team arrested 10 employees of the two third-party auditor firms. In July 2016, two   and a director of infra projects were arrested.
