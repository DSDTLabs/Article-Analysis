 Stone Temple Pilots

 Stone Temple Pilots
 
  One of the major bands of the 90s, Stone Temple Pilots (STP) have seen it all when it comes to Rock and Roll fame. But this decade has been especially tough for the grunge band given that they lost the lead singer Scott Weiland in 2013.  , who was the lead singer after Weiland, committed suicide last year, leaving STP without a lead singer. So its commendable that the band, through all the emotional turmoil, came up with this eponymous album that marks a solid return to form. 
 
 Recruiting 'X Factor' season 3 runner-up   as the lead singer was a great decision and one that will go down well with the fans, too, considering that while Gutt does fit the bill when it comes to hitting the right notes, he is in no way aping either Bennington or Weiland. This is evident in the first single that they released titled 'Meadow' that debuted at number 6 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Songs chart. A firecracker of a number, Gutt pumps up the energy on the track from the very first beat and does not let go. The track Middle of Nowhere, the first on the album is a power packed performance piece best enjoyed live. Never Enough, with its rough edge and superlative lyrics is possibly one of the strongest songs. Another brilliant number is The Art of letting go. A beautiful, song that resembles all the good things of 90's rock, is a very personal song where the band reminisces the two musicians they lot. However, the real tribute the band pays to Weiland and Bennington is on Finest Hour with lines like "I know the pressure you were under," and "Up to the sky, I'll miss you brother. I hope you know it's true." While all the tracks are tight, on the seventh song, Roll Me Under, STP unleashes all they have in their arsenal. The riff is wicked, the drums are devastating and when Gut says, "Roll me under, I'll pull the trigger for you,‚Äù you believe it. The packs more power than a five hour energy drink in just less than four minutes. With these 12 songs, STP present some good old 90s magic and redefine their sound and make sue that they will stay relevant for another generation of rock lovers.
