BENGALURU: Ahead of the floor test, tensions continued to rise with much bickering between Congress and BJP on Friday. BJP strongly refuted the contents of an audio clip released by Congress of an alleged phone conversation between tainted mining baron G   and a Congress elect-MLA, in which Reddy is heard luring the legislator to support BSY. 

  In the 2.41-minute clip, a voice purportedly of Reddy is heard offering money and posts to Congress' Raichur Rural MLA-elect Basavanagouda Daddal for his support during the floor test. TOI could not verify the clip's authenticity. 
 
 Union minister and BJP's Karnataka election in-charge Prakash Javadekar claimed that it was a fake clip that needed to be investigated. "The Congress's dirty tricks department is working full time. By releasing fake clips, they are trying to defame BJP ahead of trust vote fearing their imminent defeat. We condemn such acts," he said.
 
 Reddy's confidant and party MLA B Sriramulu also said it was fake. "I have informed Reddy about this,'' he added.
 
 Congress MLC V S Ugrappa played out the audio, in Kannada, to mediapersons.
