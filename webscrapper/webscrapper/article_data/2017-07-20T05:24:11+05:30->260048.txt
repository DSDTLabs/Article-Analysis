KOLKATA:   on Wednesday claimed its fourth victim in south Dum Dum this year with the death a 43-year-old homemaker. Ranjita Mondal, the victim, had tested positive on July 15.

 Mondal, a resident of 126 MC   under ward 14 of South Dum Dum Municipality, was being treated at home by a local doctor. As her platelet count dropped, the doctor advised immediate hospitalization. Accordingly, she was admitted to Sanjivani Hospital in Bagbazar on July 18.
 
 “My mother’s platelet count dropped to 24,000 after she was admitted to the hospital. We suggested that she might need some platelet units. But the doctors asked us not to interfere with the treatment,” alleged son Sayan, a college student. The family was informed on Tuesday midnight that the patient was being put on ventilation. Mondal was declared dead at 4.15am on Wednesday.
 
 When angry family members alleged negligence and sought an explanation from the hospital authorities, the latter called in police and local political leaders. “Local goons as well as police threatened us to take the body and leave or else they would arrest us. Don’t we have the right to ask the hospital administration why the patient did not get the right treatment? We were not there to create any ruckus,” said Prabir Samanta, Mondal’s elder brother.
 
 The family also claimed that the patient did not have any other health issue before she was detected with dengue. She had suffered massive bleeding before she died. They also felt there were attempts to cover up the fact that the patient had tested positive. 
 
 Local   councillor  , who had gone to the hospital, claimed that he had to step in because “the relatives of the patient were at loggerheads with the hospital”. Ghosh further said that had he not intervened, the situation would have turned violent.
 
 “All I tried to do was pacify the family and at the same time make the hospital authorities understand that there was no point fighting over the death of a patient,” Ghosh said.
