PUNE: The district administration has issued notices to 19 educational, charitable and government institutes for   of government land lease  .

 These institutes were given government land — on various conditions and for different periods of time — three to four decades ago. Following checks, the state government found that in the case of these 19 institutes, either the lands were left unused or were used in ways that violated the   norms.
 
 According to the records, 346 institutions in the district were allotted 637 hectares on lease for various purposes. Of them, 82 were found violating lease norms over the past few years, for which notices had been issued. This year, the district administration withdrew lands from 10 institutions and issued notices to 19 for violation of land lease norms.
 
 Pune district collector Saurabh Rao said as per government resolution, these lands are given on lease (as well as occupancy), and there are separate norms for construction activity with the permission of the administration. “We give extensions as per rules, but if there is a gross violation, we withdraw the land,” he said.
 
 “The violations pertain to non-renewal of the lease, not using the land for the intended purpose, not initiating construction work within two years or leasing property to another person without intimating the collector,” said resident deputy collector  .
 
 Besides leased lands, the government has also decided to focus on plots granted to institutions at subsidized rates after issuing norms in each case.
