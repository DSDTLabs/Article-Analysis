NEW DELHI: Saying there are no permanent enemies in politics, the   has defended its understanding with the   for the two Lok Sabha bypolls in the state as a “demand of the political situation”. It has also questioned why the   had earlier tied up with its vocal critics.

 SP’s national vice-president feand a close aide of party chief  ,   told ET that BJP has “no moral right” to question the SPBSP understanding. “CM Yogi Adityanath is nervous and so calling us names like a snake and a mongoose. If you say this understanding will have no impact, why attack it daily? BJP had many adversaries - why did it tie up with Ram Vilas Paswan in Bihar who was its big enemy at one point of time? Or for that matter with Nitish Kumar in Bihar? K Chandrashekhar Rao, who was once an NDA ally, is now floating a third front unity against BJP. There are no permanent enemies in politics, everything changes with a political situation, decisions are taken based on that,” Nanda told ET, in the first such comments from a senior SP leader on the latest political development. Nanda also saidBSP leaders are expected to be present in Akhilesh rally in Phulpur on March 9.
 
 Akhilesh had on Monday on Twitter thanked the BSP and some other parties for supporting SP in the two upcoming bypolls. “Total 12 parties, including the BSP, left parties and RLD, have supported us in these by-polls.
 
 These two by-polls will determine the direction of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,” Nanda said. Asked if an alliance between SP and BSP was on the cards for the 2019 LS polls, Nanda said one will have to wait. “The spirit of the understanding for now is to save democracy and fight the communal elements. There was no meeting between Akhilesh and Mayawati for this – it was achieved by our junior leaders.”
