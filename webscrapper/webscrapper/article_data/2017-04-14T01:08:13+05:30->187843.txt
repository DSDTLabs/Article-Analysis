MUMBAI: The Bombay   on Thursday condoned a delay of 10 days in an   filed by the   ( ) to challenge a trial court order of February. The trial court had dropped two serious charges against   recruit Areeb Majeed. 

 The high court posted the NIA appeal for hearing on June 5 and a bench of Justice V K Tahilarami and Justice M S Karnik granted no stay on the trial.
 
 The sessions court where the case was listed on Thursday adjourned it to April 27. The investigation agency wanted a stay on the trial court proceedings but advocate Mubin Solkar, who appeared for Majeed, opposed such a plea. Solkar said the trial court may be permitted to proceed with the trial for other charges against him. The case is at the pre-trial stage of framing of charges. Earlier last month the NIA had sought time as it moved the high court in appeal.
 
 NIA lawyer Prakash Shetty said the appeal was delayed as it could not apply for a certified copy of the February 8 order till February 22. It finally filed the appeal in the third weeek of March. An appeal can be filed within 30 days of an order. Solkar said the accused had applied for a copy and it was ready by February 13.
