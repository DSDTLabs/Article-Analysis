NEW DELHI: Ordered to face CBI probe for allegedly scuttling investigations into coal block allocation scam cases, former CBI director   told the Supreme Court on Thursday that it had erred in adopting “double standards” in judging entries in two sets of controversial diaries. 

 In an application seeking recall of the 
  into alleged meetings between him and those accused in the coal scam on the basis of entries in the visitors’ diary at his official residence, Sinha said the evidentiary value of the diary entries was far worse than the entries in diaries found on executives of Birla and Sahara groups revealing alleged payment of “bribes” to politicians. 
 
 Sinha’s application, settled by senior advocate Vikas Singh, drew attention to the court’s January 11 judgment rejecting to take cognisance of diary entries of corporate executives on the ground that “the court has to be on guard while ordering investigation against any important constitutional functionary, officers or any person in the absence of some cogent legally cognisable material”. 
 
 Referring to the unverified visitors’ diary entries which formed the basis of the SC order directing inquiry into his alleged meetings with accused without the presence of investigation officers, Sinha said if the same principle was applied to the corporate diary entries naming top politicians as purported receivers of corporate bribes, then registration of FIRs against them became imperative. 
 
 “In case cognisance on the basis of the contents of executives’ diaries is to be taken, admittedly it would result in registration of clear cut cases under Indian Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act,” the former CBI director’s petition said. 
 
 It added that unlike the corporate diaries, the purported visitors’ diary in case relating to Sinha contained only such entries of meetings and “no criminal case could be made out per se”.
