Tirupur: A 31-year-old groom-to-be committed suicide by hanging from the ceiling of his house at Ayyan Nagar here on Thursday after he could not arrange money for his marriage.

 According to police, R Roobesh Kumar, a native of Thottiyam in Trichy district, was to get married to his cousin on May 20.
 
 “Roobesh and his brother moved to the city a few years ago, while their parents stayed back at Thottiyam itself. He was running an electronic home appliances repairing shop,” said a police officer.
 
 Roobesh, the officer said, wanted around Rs 3 lakh towards the wedding expenses and approached his brother, who gave him his property documents to be pledged. But it seemed that Roobesh could not arrange the money.
 
 On Thursday evening, Roobesh was found hanging from the ceiling of his house at Ayyan Nagar. His body was handed over to his family after the postmortem.
 
 Tirupur central police have registered a case and further investigations are on.
