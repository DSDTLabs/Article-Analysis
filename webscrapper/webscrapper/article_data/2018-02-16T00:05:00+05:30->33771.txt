 lovers in the city will be in for a treat as the second edition of the Udupa Music Festival begins today. The three-day music festival will play host to renowned   and world music artistes like Grammy award winner John McLaughlin, Pandit Shivkumar Sharma, Rahul Sharma, Shankar Mahadevan, Gino Banks, Mysore Nagaraj and more.

 Giridhar Udupa, ghatam player and curator of the festival, says, “Every year, we try to do something different at the festival and this time we have John McLaughlin performing at the  . In addition to this, we also have members of Remember Shakti performing. After the demise of U Srinivas (also known as Mandolin Srinivas), the group is coming together for the first time as a tribute to him.”
 Pandit Shivkumar Sharma and his son Rahul Sharma teaming up together after a gap of about seven years is another highlight of the festival, says Giridhar. But why have a festival like this? “We feel that classical music has not reached to a lot of people and we want to change that. We want to introduce classical music to people not just in Bengaluru, but everywhere else. We also want to bridge the gap between classical and world music, and John accepting the invitation is a blessing for us.”
 
 The audiences, says Giridhar, will be treated to Carnatic classical,   classical and world music at the festival and performances that will leave them musically enriched. “Audiences will see these legends perform and if that makes them happy, if it touches their soul, then it serves the purpose,” Giridhar sums up.
