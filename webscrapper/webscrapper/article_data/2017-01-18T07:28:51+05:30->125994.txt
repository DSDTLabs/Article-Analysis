AHMEDABAD: A concerted campaign by the   in 1948 had compelled   to declare the Asiatic lion as the national animal. But in 1972, the Bengal tiger was adopted as the national animal in a meeting of the Indian Board for Wildlife.

Despite the numbers and vast territorial range of Bengal tigers, the government formed a special   in 2005. Even with Asiatic lions on the brink of extinction, there is no such authority at the national level.   MP, and a member of the parliament committee on assurances, Hussain Dalwai, told TOI: “The committee now believes that there should be an exclusive Project Lion .” C N Pandey, a former principal chief conservator of forests, said: “Once ‘Project Lion’ comes into place, the Union government will be committed to allocating funds for lion conservation.”
