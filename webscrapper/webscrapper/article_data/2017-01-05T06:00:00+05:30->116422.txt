Visakhapatnam: Though cities like Visakhapatnam are now largely relieved of the  , the people in rural, plain and agency areas are still facing problems with lower denominations.

 According to sources, banks like AP Grameena Vikas Bank (APGVB) and district co-operative banks are stuck with higher currency notes. 
 
 P Sriramulu Naidu, a customer from Srikakulam district, said, “Customers of the banks like State Bank of India, Andhra Bank are getting Rs 100 notes at the branches, but customers of APGVB are still getting only Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 currency notes. Getting lower currency in the plain areas is becoming a difficult task.” 
 
 D Sriram Patnaik, manager of AP Grameena Vikas Bank for Kasibugga branch in Srikakulam district, however, said the cash crunch situation has normalised now. “We are now able to deliver Rs 24,000 a week to our customers. We are getting sufficient Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. On Tuesday, we got Rs 2.5 crore to distribute among 18 branches of our bank. However, there is shortage of Rs 100 notes but it would be sorted out soon,” Sriram Patnaik told TOI.
 
 Ajoy Kumar Pandit, State Bank of India deputy general manager for Visakhapatnam zone covering three districts of Srikakulam, Vizianagaram and Visakhapatnam, said people have now started depositing Rs 100 currency notes in the banks and this is likely to address the shortage of lower denominations.
 
 Ajoy said the SBI was now delivering the cash to post offices, district co-operative banks and business correspondents. 
 
 Srikakulam collector P Lakshmi Narasimham said, “We are giving priority to pensioners, farmers and beneficiaries of other schemes to distribute the cash in lower denominations. I also told the bankers to ensure that people don’t face any kind of currency issue. The situation has normalised now.”
