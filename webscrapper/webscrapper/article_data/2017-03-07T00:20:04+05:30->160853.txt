THANE: NCP leader   has challenged the recent revision of electoral rolls across the state, alleging that the present list was defective as names of several eligible voters were missing. The politician from Mumbra has now filed a PIL in the Bombay high court following a number of complaints from voters about missing names in the list that was released ahead of the   in several civic bodies across the state. He has also requested to form a panel to revamp the process of preparing the rolls ahead of the forthcoming polls in 2019. 

 “Scores of voters were unable cast their vote as their names were not on the list or had incorrect photographs against their names. As many as 12 lakh voters from Mumbai alone found their names missing. The situation was more or less the same in other civic bodies as well. Surprisingly, names of voters who had voted during the previous assembly polls were also missing in the revised rolls,” said Awhad. 
 
 Through the PIL, (a copy of which is with TOI), the leader has attempted to bring to the attention of the court that if the same list was carried forward then it would end up depriving lakhs of citizens from their right to vote in the forthcoming 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly polls.
