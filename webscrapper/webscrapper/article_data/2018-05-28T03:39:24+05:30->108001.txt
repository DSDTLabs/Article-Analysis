THANE: After seeing a positive result of their two-year-old unique reflective collar distribution project for strays, which was aimed at putting an end to the growing number of stray animal deaths and injuries due to road accidents, Thane-based   PAWS has started distributing these collars once again this year. 

 After observing that the issue of strays being killed in road accidents was common, especially along the highways and major roads across the district because of visibility issues at night, the volunteers of PAWS stumbled upon a project by a team of   engineers that used reflectors in dog collars to alert those around them at night. The NGO then decided to bring this project to the city to save the strays here.
 
 While the NGO has distributed over 200 such collars to   across Thane, Dombivali, Kalyan and Navi Mumbai since their launch at IIT-Bombay's Tech-Fest January 2016, they have started distributing another 100 collars before the monsoon this year.
 
 Nilesh  , founder of PAWS, said, "Due to low visibility at night and foggy weather in the rains, drivers don't often see the strays on the road and end up hitting them. At times these strays are either injured or killed. Over the past two years, we have seen a major difference in the number of accidents in areas where these collars have been distributed. We hope this initiative drops the number of accidents of strays."
 
 Speaking about the collar and its upkeep, Bhanage said, "The collar is made of a nylon band that is put around the neck of the animal by one of the members of the NGO. The silver fluorescent part on the outer side of the collar acts as a reflector and shines when hit by the headlight. If the collar gets damaged then will be replaced," he added.
