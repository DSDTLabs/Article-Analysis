From drug addiction to legal troubles   has seen a lot in his life and the actor hopes his son does not become like him. 

  
  
 Sanjay Dutt, who is the son of veteran actors   and  , had a tough time getting over his drug addiction. He was arrested for illegal possession of arms in a case related to the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts. Last year he was released from the Yerawada Jail where he served 42 months as a part of his five-year sentence. Dutt said he cannot afford to bear the pain his father went through because of his tumultuous life. 
 
 "My father raised us as normal children. I was sent to a boarding school, I went through the grind. And I am the same way with my children."
 
 "I try to teach them the values of life, give them 'sanskaar', and teach them (that) respect for elders is very important even if they are your servants. And that you have got to value life. I only pray my son is not like me. Because what my dad went through, I don't want to go through that," Dutt said. 
 
 The actor has three-year-old son Shahraan and daughter Iqra with wife  . He also has a daughter, Trishala, from his first wife Richa Sharma. Dutt, 58, also opened up about his struggle with drug addiction and said now when he is over it, he advises youngsters to stay way from it and get high 'on life'. 
 
 "I got into drugs in college. It used to be like if you're not into it, you're not in the scene. So, I started it, but I got so hooked on to it that it took me about 10 years to get out."
 
 "But I was lucky that I had the means and the provisions to get out of it. I saw life differently without drugs and I want to tell the young guys that please stay high on your life, on your family, or your work. There's no substance which can make you high." 
 
 The actor will be seen next in 'Bhoomi'. The movie marks his first after his release from prison last year.
