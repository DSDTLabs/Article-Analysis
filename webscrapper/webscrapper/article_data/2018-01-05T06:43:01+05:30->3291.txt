LUCKNOW: The severe winter chill has set in but   (LMC) is yet to   in the city to keep the homeless warm and safe. And, many allege that these bonfires, around 350, are limited to VIP areas, prominent crossings and near bungalows of the affluent alone. 

 LMC says providing firewood to VIP areas is their priority. "We give priority to areas where a lot of recommendations come from powerful people. After providing firewood to these areas, we select areas identified in our internal survey. These are not our priority but we certainly provide firewood to these sites if a lot of requests pour in from the corporators or the common man" says LMC chief engineer Suraj Pal Singh. Bonfires are regularly lit in VIP areas like Darulshafa, Butler Palace, Kalidas Marg, Mall Avenue, Gautampalli, near   and Vidhayak Niwas while numerous public places and markets deep within localities have been missed out in the process.
 
 
 
 
 Many are seen burning tyres on streets to keep themselves warm. TOI’s survey on Tuesday and Wednesday nights revealed that though popular markets at Aminabad, Gole Market, and Chowk -- that witness high footfall -- have been deprived of bonfires, bonfires are lit in front of the LMC’s head office in Lalbagh. Even public places like Charbagh railway station have been missed out.
 
 Every year, LMC sanctions Rs 35-40 crore to procure firewood from the  . While the civic body began setting up bonfires from mid-December, only one-fourth of the budget for buying firewood has been spent yet. LMC said that it had counted the number of shelter-less people within city and the figure was close to 5000. “We cannot put firewood at every crossing. We lit bonfires only at places which witness high footfall and see maximum number of poor taking refuge. However as the weather becomes more severe, we are planning to take the total count of bonfires to 500.”
