BENGALURU:   are set to make a killing on Friday, with a number of people headed out of the city to   in their hometowns in different parts of the state, and with the   and police department hiring 4,000   buses for election duty.

 Taking advantage of the massive demand for seats and shortage of state buses, private bus operators have hiked prices — by as much as three times on some routes. 
 
 KSRTC operates 8,796 buses every day, but now, with a shortage of buses, travellers are at the mercy of private operators. Tickets prices to destinations such as Belagavi, Mangaluru and Hassan are being sold for three times the fare KSRTC normally charges.
 
 “The rates are usually high on Friday evenings because of the weekend rush, but demand is much higher this week because of election and also due to shortage of KSRTC buses,” said Bhairava Siddaramaiah, president of the Karnataka Maxi Cab and Motor Cab Owners' Welfare Association.
 
  officials admitted there is a huge demand for tickets on most routes for Friday, but have announced only one special train. “We have decided to operate the Yeshwantpur-Belagavi-Yeshwantpur Tatkal special on Friday to clear extra rush of passengers,” said a senior South Western Railway official.
 
 A senior transport department official said the department will conduct checks at major bus terminuses across the city on the eve of elections to ensure passengers are not fleeced, but passengers themselves are not holding their breath.
