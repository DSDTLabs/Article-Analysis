Amritsar: On the eve of elections of the Chief   ( ), a video and a copy of an FIR alleging involvement of Santokh Singh, one of the contenders for the post of president, in a land dispute case have gone viral. The sender has posted a copy of the FIR lodged by   at   police station under sections of cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy on June 6, 2013, against Santokh and others.

 Santokh is one of the other top contenders for the post, along with officiating president of CKD Dhanraj Singh and Rajmohinder Singh Majitha. He said that, “The video by Lakhbir and others maligning me is false and has been reported to the cybercrime branch.” He said the police had filed cancellation reports and the court had already dismissed the case. “Such messages are false propaganda during elections,” he maintained.
 
 The elections for the post of president, vice-president and secretary of CKD are scheduled to be held on Sunday. The elections were necessitated after the unceremonious exit of its president Charanjit Singh Chadha. Sources said efforts were being made to not only politicize the CKD but also radicalize the institution with the involvement of the Congress, SAD and Damdami Taksal, whose chief Harnam Singh Dhumma had made an appeal to vote for a particular candidate.
 
 Member of the CKD Jaswinder Singh Advocate said political forces should be kept at bay during the polling process of the 115-year-old Sikh body that is into charitable work and runs many educational and social institutions. “If it is not done then the position of this Sikh charitable institution will also be denigrated,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, CKD members from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have arrived in Amritsar while those from Delhi and other parts of Punjab are likely to reach by Sunday morning for casting their votes.
