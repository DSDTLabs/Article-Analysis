 This injured caracal had been rescued from a dry well in core area of   last week in a serious condition.
 
 After a preliminary treatment, it was referred to the   for surgery where an orthopedic surgery was conducted on Monday. Locally known as 'siyagosh', the caracal is a medium-sized wild cat, a native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia and India, which is listed in the   Red List as the threatened specie. 
 
 Only 28 caracals are in Rajasthan as per the 2015-16 Census, said wildlife experts.
 
 According to one of the veterinarins Shravan Singh Rathore, this was first-of-its-kind surgery conducted on any endangered animal listed in category one.

 He said that the only option to save the caracal was to fix a steel rod to join the broken bone. After the surgery which lasted over an hour, it was kept in a small cage at Jaipur Zoo under observation.
