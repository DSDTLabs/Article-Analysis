DHARAMSHALA: The Ex-servicemen League, during its state-level annual meet here, has demanded increase in the quota of   in the armed forces. It also sought to move the case of Kargil martyr   to the International Court of Justice. Supporting their demand, governor Acharya Devvrat said the quota for recruitment from the state should not be based on population, but on the valour and spirit of the soldiers.

 The meet was held at a auditorium here, where the governor acted as the chief guest. The issue was raised by league President Major   Mankotia, who said the union government should also consider a separate regiment and core for this state. “After 1971, the decision of making a quota on the basis of population has adversely affected hill states. Before that, the army was the major source of employment in Himachal. In view of the bravery and sacrifices of this state, a separate core and regiment could also be planned,” he said.
 
 The governor, during his address, said a national defence academy should also be opened in the state, keeping in view the significant contribution to armed forces from the state. He said: “It will induce youth from the state to join forces as officers. The state has been a land of brave soldiers, and their bravery was witnessed many a time in the wars fought on different frontiers of the nation. In Kargil, about 52 brave soldiers lost their lives from this state.” President, Indian Ex-Servicemen League Lt. General Balbir Singh expressed gratitude to the Prime Minister for fulfilling the long-standing demand of ‘one-rank, one-pension’ that has raised the morale of the forces.
