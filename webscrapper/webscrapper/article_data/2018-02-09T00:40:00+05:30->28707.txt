Coimbatore: Hit hard by the daily revision of petrol and diesel prices,   in the city have decided to increase fares by 25%.

 District president of Truck Owners Association KS Kaliyaperumal said the association had advised truck owners to increase operational fares by 25%. “Truck owners from all over Tamil Nadu participated in a demonstration held in Chennai on Wednesday and demanded that petrol and diesel be brought under the GST regime,” he said.
 
 In the last one year alone, diesel price has increased by around Rs 9, said state president of the Lorry Owners Association Kumaraswamy. “ If diesel is brought under the GST regime, the price will come down by at least Rs 20. We also demand that the state government decrease the VAT on diesel,” he said.
 
 After oil companies introduced daily price revision of petrol and diesel on June 16 last year, truck owners say they have been finding it difficult to fix the rent of their vehicles. “The price of diesel when we start a trip is different from that when it ends. This makes it difficult for us to fix the rent. Also, customers hardly notice the price rise, as it happens in terms of 10 to 12 paise per day,” a truck owner said.
 
 Meanwhile, consumer activists in the city said that though the concerns of the truck owners were justified, 25% hike in fares was a bit too high. “This will have a cascading effect on the cost of procurement of essential commodities right from vegetables. It will be the end consumers, who will be affected,” said K Kathirmathiyon of the Coimbatore Consumer Cause. “No one is prepared to sacrifice from their profit margin and consumers are made to pay for it,” he added.
