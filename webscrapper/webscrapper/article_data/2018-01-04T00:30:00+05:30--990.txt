Bengaluru: Projecting himself as the most “available” chief ministerial aspirant in the 2018 assembly elections, JD(S) state president H D Kumaraswamy on Wednesday said he’ll open the corridors of power to the people without any security inhibitions.

 At an interaction with senior citizens at the Jnana Jyothi Auditorium, Kumaraswamy said: “I’ll give open access to all the people to the Vidhana Soudha, remove barricades around the secretariat and allow people to walk in 24/7. If I come to power, people will have the access to catch me by the collar and ask questions.”
 
 Kumaraswamy also promised senior citizens that all those aged above 60 will be eligible for free Namma Metro rail pass and BMTC bus pass. “While free Metro and BMTC passes will be given to senior citizens in Bengaluru, free passes will be given to all senior citizens to travel in Karnataka,” he said.
