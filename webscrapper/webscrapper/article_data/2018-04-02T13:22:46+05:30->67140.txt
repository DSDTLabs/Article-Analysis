HYDERABAD: Photos of a traffic policeman feeding a homeless old woman went viral on social media on Sunday. The humane act by Kukatpally   station home guard B   (1275) has touched the hearts of netizens and the photo of the cop feeding the woman has gone viral on Twitter.

 Gopal found the woman sitting next to the road near JNTU in Kukatpally. Moved by her pitiable condition, Gopal purchased puris and fed her as she appeared too weak even to eat on her own.
 
 “This called change, not only friendly police, also called social responsibility,” a netizen   commented on the photo of the home guard feeding the woman. “Humanity can be clearly seen in this gentleman. Hats off to   garu” commented another netizen. Even Cyberabad CP VC Sajjanar appreciated the kind act of the home guard on Twitter.
 
 In another incident, Malkajgiri traffic cops helped a family as the front wheels of their car had accidentally slipped into a road side nala, due to poor visibility as a result of heavy rain on Sunday evening.
