PATNA: Proving their determination and grit, two women   riders from Bihar embarked on an all India expedition from Patna on January 27 this year to create awareness about ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’.

 Sabita Mahto from Saran and Tabassum Ali from Munger, armed with nothing but a GPS, will be returning to the city on Tuesday after covering nearly 12,500 kilometres through 29 states en route Delhi in 173 days.
 
 Letters of recommendation from NCC Group commander (Patna) Brigadier R V Singh and Patna traffic SP Prantosh Kumar Das helped them in getting accommodations at various police stations. Accommodations were also provided by the Army, NCC units, Assam Rifles, BSF and ex-servicemen at their guesthouses. Wherever they went, the two women tried to propagate and create awareness about ‘Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao’ among school and college students and whoever they met en route their journey.
 
 NCC cadets, along with students from Magadh Mahila College and Sacred Heart School, will be present to cheer the two women on the completion of their journey. 
 
 NCC Group (Patna) has planned a welcome function for them at the NCC headquarters in Rajendra Nagar on Tuesday. 
 
 According to Brigadier Singh, the function will be attended by art, culture and youth affairs minister Shiv Chandra Ram, divisional Commissioner Anand Kishor, district magistrate Sanjay Agarwal, SSP Manu Maharaaj and additional director general, NCC Directorate (Bihar and Jharkhand) Major General Shammi Sabharwal.
