CHENNAI: Police on Saturday clarified that at least eight of the 12   cameras installed at the   were in working condition. However, as the cameras that focus the station entrance are outdated, retrieving the footage of the miscreants who hurled petrol bombs at the station on Thursday from the cameras’ digital video recorder (DVR) has proved to be a difficult task. 

 Police personnel have roped in the help of software engineers from leading software companies to retrieve the data. On Thursday morning miscreants hurled country-made petrol bombs at the entrance of the   police station. A police vehicle was damaged in the attack .
 
 An investigation officer said, “We will get a breakthrough, as we are analysing the available CCTV footage.” Police have so far detained 15 suspects in connection with the incident. Joint commissioner of police, South Chennai,   is directly monitoring the investigation of the case.
 
 Police said, a couple of CCTV cameras in the station were damaged in Cyclone Vardah last December. These are yet to be replaced. While five high definition CCTV cameras were recently installed in the station, they were not focusing the station’s entrance where the incident took place.
