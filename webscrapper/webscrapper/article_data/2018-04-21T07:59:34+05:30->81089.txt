BHOPAL: The   in   in the city are quiet these days. Despite introduction of activitybased learning and distribution of kits for ‘joyful’ learning, most government schools are facing the problem of low attendance.

 According to some teachers, this figure is as low as 20 per cent.
 
 
 The students responded to the new methods of learning in the early days of the academic session — and the numbers strengthened. However, in last two weeks, acute absenteeism has hit the state-run primary and middle schools.
 
 “The problem of low attendance persists in most of the city schools. The school education department switched to April session but the students do not want to come to school so early,” said president of Madhya Pradesh Teachers’ Association Upendra Kaushal. “They are used to June session and is possibly one of the reason for the thinning attendance,” he added.
 
 “A large of number families in rural areas migrate during summer season in search of work in other districts. Many parents keep their children indoors to prevent seasonal illness,” said Arif Anjum, a teacher.
 
  said that it is the job of teachers to motivate the students to attend school. RSK has set the school timings keeping in view the summer head. “These are all excuses. Students will get used to the timings once they come to school regularly,” said an RSK official, adding that since the concept of academic session beginning in April is something new for the kids, teachers will have to motivate them to come to school.
 
 There are around 1,21,660 government schools where 1,01,56,844 students from Class 1 to 12 are enrolled across the state. Many schemes, including midday meal, free school dress, free books and free education are being run to attract children to schools. About Rs 300 crore is spent on the education of students in government-run schools annually.
