PUNE: Recent incidents of fire and thunderstorm have prompted the city   to look for   vehicles that can have easy access in congested areas and the central parts, where the buildings are closely erected and the roads are narrow. 

 The fire department has asked for three such vehicles in the initial phase and will demand for more depending on its utility.
 
 A source in the department said, “Often bigger fire tenders with a capacity of 4,500 litre find it difficult to reach rescue spots in congested areas. So we are looking for smaller vehicles, which can travel to interior locations without any hindrance. These vehicles will not have to face problems while taking turns at smaller chowks or passing through narrow lanes. The smaller vehicles, with a 2,000-litre capacity, have much compact frame against the bigger firetrucks”, sources said.
 
 According to the department, the city’s peth areas, slum pockets, areas in Hadapsar, Dhankawadi regions are densely populated and have narrow lanes. The department plans to deploy the smaller vehicles in these areas.
 
 The fire brigade is also planning to install advanced vehicle-tracking system on its firetrucks to locate them in real time. 
 
 Presently, none of the fire department vehicles come with this system. The department communicates with the vehicles over radio or phone.
 
 Meanwhile, officials in the department said they were exploring options to ensure that the control room numbers work without any glitches. The recent thunderstorm affected the fire department’s control room number (101) for some time. “The control room receives maximum calls during disaster situations. To ensure uninterrupted working of control room numbers, we are planning to adopt better technology,” officials said.
