TRICHY: A 48-year-old man was arrested by the   police for impregnating his minor daughter. The incident came to light only on Friday after the minor who fell ill revealed to her family members about the repeated sexual assaults she suffered at her father’s hands.

 Police sources said the accused hailing from a village near Jeyankondam town in Ariyalur district is an agricultural labourer. He used to rear cattle and livestock with the help of his 15-year-old daughter, a Class VIII dropout. Few months ago, while rearing livestock with his daughter at a secluded place, he is said to have sexually assaulted the victim multiple times and had also threatened her to not reveal the incident to anyone.
 
 Meanwhile, the girl fell ill owing to irregularity in her menstrual cycle and visited a government hospital with her mother on Friday. “After diagnosis, doctors informed the victim’s mother that the 15-year-old was pregnant. The girl subsequently told them about the sexual assaults she suffered from her father. We registered a case after hospital management in the Ariyalur alerted us about the incident,” the investigating officer told TOI.
 
 Based on a complaint from the victim’s mother, all women police personnel in Jeyankondam on Friday arrested the father under Section 5 (l)(j), clause (i)(l) Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act ( ) and under Section 106 of IPC. Sources said the minor was under medical observation while the accused was remanded in judicial custody and subsequently lodged at the central prison in Trichy.
