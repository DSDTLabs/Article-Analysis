INDORE: Supporting district administration’s crackdown on   running their clinics or hospitals by violating norms, Indore branch of   (IMA) has now raised their demand to take   serving in major hospitals of city.

 “Many big hospitals in the city have employed doctors, who have completed their study other than modern medicine, and are deployed in intensive care units (ICU) further posing threat to life of patients admitted there” said  .
 
 Despite clear directives from Medical Council of India to deploy  , even many known and big hospitals are flouting rules by appointing BHMS, BUMS and medicos from other stream for the sake of saving money.
 
 “We already have apprised nursing association with the issue but in vain. We have now decided to visit hospitals personally and urge management to appoint MBBS doctors in ICU,” said Dr Londhe.
 
 Chief medical and health officer Dr HN Nayak said that action will be taken if complaint against any hospital for deployment of non-MBBS doctors in ICU will be received.
 
 “As per the rules, only MBBS doctors can be deployed in ICU. On receiving any such complaint we will take action against errant hospitals after investigation under Nursing Home Act,” Dr Nayak told TOI.
 
 Meanwhile, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Shalini Shrivastava said that action against those found violating rules set by health department in clinics as well as in hospitals will be continued.
 
  A report on action taken against 14 clinics and hospitals in Azad Nagar and Musakhedi area on Thursday, will be submitted before district collector, and he will decide further course of action, she added.
