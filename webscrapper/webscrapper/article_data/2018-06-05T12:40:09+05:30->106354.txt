This Ahmedabad-based three-year-old band first met at a jazz-and-blues festival in 2015. What followed next was the coming together of a six-member band — Harmish Joshi (saxophonist),   (guitarist), Harmony Siganporia (vocalist), Dhaivat Jani (drummer), Marc Damania (bassist) and Nayan Kapadiya (keyboardist). With a mix of originals and covers to their credit, the band plays a lot of groove jazz, experimental jazz and what they call, the “Ahmedabadi jazz”.
Speaking about the inspiration behind their music and lyrics, Raag says, “We try to not get too caught up in the semantics of our titles or lyrics. We make music that we think sounds and feels good, so in that sense it’s more absolute than programmatic music.” 
 The members are largely inspired by Indian artists namely Warren Mendonsa, Jai Row, Louis and Gino Banks and Sanjay Divecha; internationally, it’s Mark Kelso, Joshua Redman, Stan Getz, among others.
 The band’s name, which is simple yet with no specific reference to its genre, piques our interest when we ask them about its history. Shares Marc, “We were at a practice (during the days when they did not have a band name), having chai and discussing the structure of one of our songs, when someone said, ‘It sounds good, but it’s not working time wise’. Something just clicked, and we all looked at each other and went, ‘Yeah,  , it is’.”
 Talking about the state of the genre in India, Harmony says, “It’s amazing to see many new places dedicated to jazz, spring up around the country. This provides incentives to a lot of people to start playing jazz. We are adding our little contribution to the scene by making music that is unmistakably ours.”
 On their to-do list is to perform to pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff’s   piece. “It’s an exciting prospect. Everything about the structure, the origin behind it and the main theme in the first movement, highlights everything a good musical piece should have. Anyone who listens to it once will feel it,” says Raag.
