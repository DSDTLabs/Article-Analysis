MUMBAI: Rail fans will get a glimpse into history as Central Railway has planned ' ' at the P D'mello side entrance of CSMT. 

 CSMT heritage building already has a museum but its entrance is from the DN Road side, the more popular access route to the terminus.
 
 CR's divisional railway manager,  , said, "We plan to have old engines and heritage- era railway instruments besides other attractions displayed in this gully."
 
 The major attraction is the Indian first electric loco- 1500 DC Sir   locomotive. It was named after the governor of Bombay who had flagged one such   in 1928.
 
 The 123-ton locomotive with 2600 Horse Power capacity was built and assembled in Swiss Locomotives. It arrived in Mumbai in 1928 and was used to haul the famous Deccan Queen. It was withdrawn in the 1950s as the more advanced locomotive that can haul longer trains was introduced in service.
 
  A senior official said, "It was used for shunting operations till the '80s and decommissioned in 1992." The loco is stationed at Kalyan and CR is checking if it can be transported to the Heritage Gully by road.
