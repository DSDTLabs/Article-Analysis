BAREILLY: A day after assuming office as district president of the   unit here,   asserted that he will work on priority to improve party’s presence in urban areas.
 
  He was speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing political churning in the party involving its prospective alliance partner Congress. It is widely speculated that the party might concede both of the urban seats in the region to   in the prospective alliance where SP has performed abysmally in the past.
  
  Speaking to TOI, Subhlesh said, “In a special gesture, residents of Model town in the city have organised a small function to welcome our new office bearers. This is complete departure from the past given that the area is dominated by Sikhs and traders which are traditionally BJP voters. I have been getting calls from   which is a good sign given our performances on urban seats.”
  
  In a subtle dig at former district president   Singh Yadav, Subhlesh said, “We will try to expand our party’s presence in all the areas and will try to connect with people from every community without any discrimination as against what was the ‘norm’ earlier.”
  
  Interestingly, Subhlesh started his political career under tutelage of Veerpal who the former even accepts as the his political mentor. However, after a bitter fallout, things soured in 2008 and both parted ways. As against Veerpal, who was considered as strict administrator with a dictatorial control over the party, Subhlesh enjoys a good camaraderie within the party unit with strong support from youngsters.
