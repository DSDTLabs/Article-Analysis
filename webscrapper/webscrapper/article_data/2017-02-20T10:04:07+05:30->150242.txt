JAIPUR: With the state inching closer to  , the reservation issue has started  . 

 Close on the heels of Karni Sena upping the ante and demanding a revision of the current reservation system, the   too joined the bandwagon on Sunday and asked the government to clear its stand on 14% reservation for economically backward classes (EBCs).
 
 The state president of Rajasthan Sarwa Brahmin Mahasabha, Pandit Suresh Mishra, said that in the light of recent Rajasthan High Court and   orders on reservation for special backward classes, it has become clear that the court would not allow reservation above 50%. So without a constitutional amendment, reservation benefits cannot be given to economically backward classes.
 
 Mishra demanded the creation of a Rs 1,000 crore fund on the lines of   in the upcoming state budget for EBCs till a decision is taken on reservation.
 
 In this context, he demanded the government to clear its position on how it would deliver on its promise of 14% reservation for EBCs. In its election manifesto, the BJP government had promised reservation to EBCs and, last year, it had promised to take a decision on this issue within four months. But, till now nothing has been concretized, he said. He said now the same party was in power both at the Centre and state and they should deliver on the promise by amending the Constitution.
 
 He said as an interim measure, the state should constitute a board on the lines of Dev Narayan Board for Gujjars and EDCs with an allocation of Rs 1,000 crore in the upcoming budget.
 
 This would help the children of EBCs to get scholarships and coaching facilities to pursue professional courses and higher studies.
