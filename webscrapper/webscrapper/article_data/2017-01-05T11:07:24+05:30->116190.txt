BELAGAVI: The state government owes a whopping Rs 7,000 crore to government contractors, who have executed various development works on its behalf, said D Kempanna, president,  .

 For the past two years, the government has not cleared the bills of   due to which the latter are facing hardship, Kempanna told reporters here on Wednesday.
 
 Besides non-payment, the government’s decision to allocate public works in packages has affected the small and medium level contractors very badly. “There are more than 17,000 contractors recognized by the government. However, only 265 contractors, that too who are outsiders, are getting government works. It is mainly because of the package system introduced by the state government for the past 3-4 years which is helping only big contractors,” he said.
 
 The big contractors who bag packages are being given advance payment while small contractors are made to wait for years for payment even after successfully completing the works. “This is nothing but the government’s discrimination against the local small contractors,” he added.
 
 He also alleged that the state government has imposed harsh conditions on local contractors to fulfil the eligibility criteria whereas their counterparts from other states are getting works by producing fake documents. 
 
 In this background, the association is planning to organize a state level convention of government contractors in Bengaluru to exert pressure on the government to abolish package system in awarding public works. 
 
 Among others, the association is demanding the release of payment within one month of completion of work, 50% advance payment while issuing the work order and enhancing the limit for the 4th grade contractors to Rs. 5 lakh and for second class contractors to Rs one crore.
