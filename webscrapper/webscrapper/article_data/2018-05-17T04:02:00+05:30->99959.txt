Ahmedabad: Anil Yadav, a 50-year-old Gujarat government official, has been collecting degrees like a prodigious thermometer. He has been taking postgraduate examinations for the past 23 years, since 1995. “I want to maintain this momentum till I can,” he said. “I have travelled across India to take these examinations — from Guwahati in Assam to Bardoli in Gujarat, and from Kurukshetra in Haryana to Madurai in Tamil Nadu.” 

 Yadav was awarded the university gold medal in 2010 by Jadavpur University for obtaining first class first in MA (environment and development) examination. Yadav has five PG degrees from Ignou, four from Annamalai University, and two each from University of Madras and Gauhati University. Yadav began his career as a high school teacher in Gangtok, Sikkim.
 
 “Initially, I just wanted an MA degree for the sake of getting a postgraduate qualification,” Yadav said. “Gradually, clearing exams became a passion. I felt a sense of achievement. Young students smile at me when I enter examination halls. Some mistake me to be a professor or an invigilator.” He said his job as a teacher spurred his academic passion. 
 
 “But the essential motivation is to help students in their academic pursuits,” he said. “I also volunteer as academic counsellor for various Ignou programmes.”
