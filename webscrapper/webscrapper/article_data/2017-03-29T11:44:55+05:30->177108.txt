BENGALURU:  's abandoned quarry-turned garbage dump has turned the whole area into a wasteland of sorts. The landfill is not fenced, with the tonnes of garbage threatening to spill over the  .

 Construction of a compound wall has just begun.Over 180 trucks from Bengaluru reach the quarry every day through Kogilu Main Road. The trucks first unload mixed waste near the quarry, after which mechanized loading shovels lift the waste and dump it into the 15-20 meter deep pit.
 
 Houses in  , less than a km away from the dumpyard, remain shut for most parts of the day, thanks to the unbearable stench and villagers say they can't let their cattle graze anywhere near the dumpyard. The   next to the waste pit is also polluted and its water isn't potable.
 
 “It's inhuman. But how do we prove it's illegal?
 They claim it's BBMP land.First, we suffered due to quarry blasting and now because of such indiscriminate dumping of waste.Politicians added our village to BBMP limits for their convenience. We are paying more tax, but get z ero benefits from the BBMP,“ a villager told TOI.
 
 K V Munindra Kumar, the corporator representing Jakkur ward which covers Bellahalli, said the BBMP doesn't have permission to dump garbage here. “It's illegal. There's no security and the ragpickers somehow enter the area in search of plastic waste. I am trying my best to get the BBMP to compensate Mithun's family ,“ he said.
 
 At the dumpyard, a cop from the jurisdictional Bagalur police station keeps watch. Apart from the labourers, a BBMP officer and an officer from Karnataka Rural Infrastructure Development Limited can be seen at the site every day .
 
 As per rules, dumping at Bellhalli is allowed only between 9.30am to 4.30pm.“Why were ragpickers allowed inside the quarry and why was garbage being loaded and unloaded even after the stipulated hours,“ asked villagers.
