 The leader faulted the AP chief minister Chandrababu Naidu for this appointment. "I don't know how the CM agreed for this. He has to give an explanation to the people of AP and rest of  .
 
 However, TDP leaders strongly condemned the actor's comments. TDP leader   said that the actor is merely seeking publicity by making such comments. He further cited that Veeraiah Chowdary, a Telugu man, is serving as central vigilance commissioner. Another TDP leader   advised the actor to not create any rift between North and South.
