PATNA: Nearly two months after   (BSSC)’s chairman   was jailed for alleged involvement in a job scam, the state government on Thursday appointed bureaucrat   as the BSSC’s new chairman.

 The 1986-batch IAS official has also been given additional charge of chairman of Bihar Combined Entrance Competitive Examination (BCECE) Board. He was earlier posted as the secretary of the Bihar Human Rights Commission.
 
 Another IAS official Daya Nidhan Pandey of the 2006 batch has been appointed the examination controller of BSSC. Pandey was additional secretary in the general administration department.
 
 The Bihar chapter of IAS Officers’ Association had earlier protested against the “manner in which the 1987-batch official was arrested”. It had on February 26 adopted a resolution saying, among other things, that no IAS officer would accept the posts of BSSC chairman, BCECE’s controller of exams and Technical Services Recruitment Board chairman. 
 
 When contacted on Thursday, however, the association functionaries told TOI it would be within   to accept or refuse the posting. “Our resolution still stands,” said one office-bearer.
 
 Sudhir is among the 34 people arrested so far in connection with the   of BSSC’s competitive examinations for recruitment of 13,120 clerks in government departments.
