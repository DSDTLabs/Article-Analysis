NEW DELHI:   school students will have to sit for Class X board exams from 2018,   officials said. The decision comes after the board turned down the government’s request of extending the graded semester system for the next two years.

 The government had written to the board seeking breather and had suggested to allow the present semester system to continue so that the students currently in Class VIII and IX do not suffer. They will be made to face the first and second editions of the compulsory examination in 2018 and 2019, which they are not prepared for, the letter said.
 
 CBSE officials said the graded restoration for government schools will not be feasible as “all its policies are from a broader perspective and will be inclusive for all 18,750 CBSE schools.” 
 
 Directorate of Education has written to CBSE stating that the compulsory exams will require students to study the entire syllabus for the annual exam. They might find it difficult as they haven’t been prepared that way. Under the present semester system students study the syllabus in two different parts over two years.
 
 CBSE is yet to reply to the DoE’s letter. But R K Chaturvedi, chairman CBSE said it will not be feasible to have a different set of exam policy for Delhi government schools.
