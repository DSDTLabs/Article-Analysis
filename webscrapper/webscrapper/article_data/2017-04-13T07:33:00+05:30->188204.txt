PUNE: BJP corporator   from the Baner-Balewadi area was arrested and sent to the Yerawada jail on Wednesday for allegedly threatening a police officer on Monday. A magisterial court here will pass an order on his bail application on Thursday. 

 The police had attached a jammer on Balwadkar's car after he and his driver refused to move out of the no-parking-no-halting zone on the busy   road. 
 
 Balwadkar then allegedly threatened police inspector Shankar Damse, who lodged a complaint at the Shivajinagar police station against the corporator and his driver,  . 
 
 Public prosecutor   told TOI, "Balwadkar was arrested and produced before additional chief judicial magistrate A M Bhandarwar, who directed his remand in police custody for four hours. He was again produced before the magistrate around 5pm and the court ordered his remand in magisterial custody."
