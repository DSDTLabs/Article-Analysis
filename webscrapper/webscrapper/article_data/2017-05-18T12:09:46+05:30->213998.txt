CHANDIGARH: The names of Prof Rajesh Kumar as dean academics and   as dean research are doing the rounds in PGI.
At present, there is just one dean for the institute. On May 12, the governing body had approved two deans on the pattern of AIIMS for the institute. The race for the posts has started as the current dean, Dr  , will retire in July.
 
 “As soon as the post falls vacant, both the new deans will be appointed as per seniority," said an official in the administration at PGI. According to the seniority list, Dr Rajesh Kumar, head of the  , is on the top, followed by Dr Behera, head of pulmonary medicine, and Dr Arvind Rajwanshi, head of cytology department.These names will be sent to Union minister of health and family welfare   who would take a final decision.
 
 Dr Rajesh and   have three years to retire, while Dr Behera will retire next year. Also, subdean Dr K L N Rao will retire by this month end. The proposal for two deans has been accepted by the governing body members and chair man and Union minister of health and family welfare J P Nadda.
 
 Deans research and academics would be decided on the basis of seniority. The senior most faculty would be dean academics and the next senior would be dean research. The next in hierarchy will be the sub-dean.
 
 Unlike AIIMS, the research productivity of PGI has always been low and the same was expressed some years back by former PGI director Dr K K Talwar. “With separate deans, we can focus better on research and academics. It gets too much for one dean to manage,“ said Dr Rajwanshi.
