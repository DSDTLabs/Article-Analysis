The system allows the university/cluster to dynamically provide the question papers for an exam. For each course, system allows upload of multiple question papers, out of which only one will be selected on the exam day. For each subject, the controller of examinations will upload the different sets in to the server at SDC-2. When a question paper is uploaded, the document is encrypted and saved. Only the controller of examinations has the uploading privilege," said university examination controller S Shabu.
