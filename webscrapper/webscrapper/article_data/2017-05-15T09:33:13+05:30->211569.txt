BHOPAL: The new premises of a   in MP's   district, set up to usher in a strengthened interest among locals in  , now serve as a  .

 The school is located in Kevlali village, Bundelkhand -a region that gave several toppers in this year's MP board exams -and the new building, with two rooms and a hall, was built two years ago.
 
 The decision to build it was taken by the panchayat amid increased enrolment at the school and falling droput rates.Today , the new premises stand about 100m from the dilapidated old school building, but it is of no help to the students.
 
 It instead houses cows, bulls, and calves, with fodder stacked up in one corner and cow dung is scattered all over in piles. Diagrams of eclipses and equations painted on the walls of the classrooms are splattered with dung.
 
 Villagers said the building had been encroached upon by Lakhan Singh Rajpoot, an influential local. Headmaster Aman Singh, sounding scared, said he had “already informed the authorities“ about it.
 
 H P Kurmi, district project coordinator of school education and the immediate supervisor of primary schools of the region, said the administration will take action. “We will file an FIR against the man who converted the school into a cowshed. I have directed the school headmaster to get the new classrooms vacated to allow the students to sit there.“
 
 Minister of school education Vijay Shah said he did not know of the encroachment.“Now that you have told me, we will ensure that the cattle are removed from the school building,“ he said.
