JAGERA (LUDHIANA): Village Jagera -- which witnessed the killing of a father-son duo owing allegiance to   -- maintained its collective composure a day after they were gunned down by unidentified persons. This is quite in contrast to incidents of clashes between   and Sikhs at some places in the past few days. The two victims were from the neighbouring town of Ahmedgarh, and were shot in the shop of   (a branch of the Dera) in village Jagera on Saturday night. The village appeared completely calm and no tension was palpable, even as a sizeable section of the village population follows the Dera.

 The Naam Charcha Ghar -- in the village outskirts on the Ludhiana-Sangrur highway -- was opened over a decade ago. “There has never been any tension in the village between ‘Premis’ (Dera followers) and Sikhs, and even now, there are no negative feelings. All are feeling sad at the killings,” said Jagdev Singh, whose land is adjacent to the Dera branch. “Village residents have been purchasing daily need items. I would also often purchase things from them, and I frequently met the deceased, Satpal Joshi, and found him a very gentle fellow,” he added.
 
 “For common needs of the village during social gatherings, or during Nagar Kirtan on the occasion of Gurpurab, we would often purchase things from the shop, and there has never been any tension in the village. Even now, there is no rift at the social level,” said Barjinder Singh, another Jatt Sikh village resident.
 
 The village has around 1,400 voters, and villagers said most of the scheduled caste residents of the village -- who constitute around one third of the village population -- were followers of the Dera, but none from the Jatt Sikh or other communities. “Despite class and community divisions, there is no divide here at the social level, and there has never been a conflict,” said Chet Ram, a former panchayat member from the SC community, while sitting at a common platform where youths were playing cards.
