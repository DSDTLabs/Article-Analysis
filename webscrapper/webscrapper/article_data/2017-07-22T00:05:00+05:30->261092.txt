Famous for his raspy voice and angry tones, the news of   frontman   ‘committing suicide’ in California sent shockwaves across the world early on Friday. Also called ‘the voice of a generation’ the 41-year-old singer’s death is being mourned by celebrities, artistes and   lovers alike.

 He, apparently, hanged himself to death at his Los Angeles home late on Thursday. The rocker had struggled with drug and alcohol abuse, and once said that he had considered suicide because he had been abused as a child by an older man. Chester also opened up about being bullied in school and said, “I was knocked around like a rag doll for being skinny and looking different.” He was said to be close to Soundgarden vocalist Chris Cornell, who took his life in May.
 
 Formed in 1996, Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million albums and has won two Grammys. The band’s collaboration with rapper Jay Z, resulted in Meteora — one of the biggest alternative albums in history. Other albums by the band that topped the US music charts are Minutes to Midnight, A Thousand Suns, Living Things and One More Light.
