MUMBAI: Seven men were arrested on Monday for assaulting and duping a   by impersonating as RBI officials and promising to help him convert Rs 1.2 crore demonetized notes into new currency for a fee. Police are hunting for five of their aides who allegedly fled with the money.

 The Charkop police has also alerted the income-tax department and urged it to take action against the businessman, Rakesh Jain (36), for possessing demonetized notes.
 
 Jain met the arrested accused—Amit Soni (35), Nitin Shah (52), Bhavin Doshi (38), Mahesh Chauhan (42), Kunal Parekh (34), Rajesh Patel (50) and Ilayraja Shetty (35)—through a friend and they promised to exchange the demonetized Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 notes for a commission. Police said that they had planned to trap Jain, hand him over to the police and escape with the demonetized notes.
 
 “Jain and his friend was to meet one of the accused at Orchid Suburbia in Shravan Nagar, Kandivli (W) at 5.30pm on Monday. But when Jain refused to hand over the notes following a misunderstanding, an argument broke out,” said a police officer. 
 
 Within minutes, the other accused joined in, pushed Jain and his friend into a car, drove them to the nearby   gate and threatened to hand him over to the cops. Hearing the commotion outside, police officers detained all of them. 
 
 “The accused claimed they were   and promised to help me exchange demonetized Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes,” said Jain in his police complaint. “They forced me and my friend into a car and drove to Charkop police station where they threatened to get me arrested. As me and my friend stepped out of the car, five of the men drove away with my money.” 
 
 When TOI contacted Jain on Tuesday, he said that he would call back, but he didn’t.
