Ludhiana: Municipal Corporation has formed nine teams to keep a check on the unauthorised hoardings, posters, and other campaigning materials installed at the private properties in the city.

 Ludhiana MC joint commissioner Satwant Singh said, “Each team has nine returning officers, who have started visiting the city. The teams would quiz the owners of private properties whether the candidate has taken permission from them to install hoardings. If they have taken their consent, the complete details will be procured and the same information will be provided to the returning officer so that expenditure can be calculated in the accounts of the candidates.”
 
 He also added that if the candidate has not taken permission, the hoardings, posters or other campaigning material will be removed from the properties.
