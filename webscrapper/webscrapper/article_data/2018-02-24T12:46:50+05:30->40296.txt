JABALPUR/BHOPAL: Arguments in alleged NEET-2017 scam continued for the second day on Friday. Counsel for the state government clarified before the court that all admissions in private medical colleges against NRI seats had been cancelled and candidates fromoutsidethe state were given admission on 84 out of 94 seats in the mop up round because domicile candidates, who were offered seats, didn't apply for admission. 

 Counsel for petitioners Prithvi Naik, Shailja and   had earlier alleged that three seats of probable candidates was issued by directorate of medical education (DME), Bhopal, in the mop up round of NEET-2017 and the last list was issued as late as 7.30 pm on September 10 and candidates figuring in list were asked to present themselves in medical colleges assigned to them withrequisite documents by midnight that day itself as it was last day of admission. He had suggested that it was done to allow the private colleges to fill the vacant seats by candidates of their choice, who paid them an amount between Rs 80 lakh to Rs 1 crore. 
 
 Though the remaining 10 seats were given to domiciles of MP, yet it was against rules as they had obtained less than 50 percent marks in NEET-2017 whereas the   (MCI) rules clearly stipulated nobody scoring less than 50 percent marks would be eligible for admission in any medical college. He hadalleged irregularities in allotment of NRI seats. Division bench of Justice R S Jha and Justice   will continue hearing on petition on Monday.
