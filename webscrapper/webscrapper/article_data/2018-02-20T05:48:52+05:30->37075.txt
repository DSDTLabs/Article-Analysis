MUMBAI: After the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, came in force, the maximum punishment under section 509 of the Indian Penal Code was increased to three years in jail from imprisonment for only one year. The   against   (45), a teacher at a nursing college of a state-run hospital, was registered by one of his students on June 16, 2012.

 Under the Probation of Offenders Act, in cases where an offence is punishable with a sentence of two years or less, and the accused has no criminal antecedents, he can be granted release on admonition. The court said   was to “behave with utmost decency in his life and should not repeat his past conduct”.
 
  
  
 The FIR was filed by one of the students, who said she was in the second year of the course. Bandre was always the first to take lectures and taught her and the others about ailments. The complainant alleged that despite several reminders from students that sex was not part of the assigned topic, he continued with it. The woman complained that Bandre “name-called girl students and said they had affairs with ward boys and other teachers”. She said he didn’t change his behaviour despite a written complaint to the authorities.
 
 Before the FIR was registered, 25 nursing students had marched to the police commissioner’s office to complain against the male teacher.
 
 The complaint and another student deposed before the court. The teacher’s lawyer submitted that he was only teaching on the subject of sex. The lawyer said that talking on sex was not obscene, as it fell within the ambit of “freedom of speech and expression” guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.
 
 The court said that from the statement of one of the witnesses, it was revealed that previous batches had similar problems with the accused. The court said that the overall evidence of both witnesses showed that the accused had crossed all limits of decency and morality while teaching his students.
