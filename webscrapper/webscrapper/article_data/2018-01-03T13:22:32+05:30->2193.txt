"States such as Haryana, Jharkhand, Assam, Rajasthan, Odisha, Kerala and few others have notified their tower policies which are aligned with the RoW policy. The policies have enabling features such as no restriction on location of telecom towers, single window clearance mechanism, defined time-period for approvals and nominal administrative fees etc.   "Punjab being a very progressive state, we expect the state government to expeditiously notify the uniform comprehensive policy," he said.
