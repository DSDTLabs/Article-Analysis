We bet Adele’s ‘Hello’ has often played on loop on your playlist. Much like the rest of us, looks like the number is a hit with   and her elder daughter   too. So much so that the 17-year-old star kid even did a rendition of the ballad. 

  
  
 The former   winner posted a video on her   handle, which showcases her daughter Renee crooning ‘Hello’. Like any mother, Sushmita too was beaming with pride on her daughter’s achievement and expressed her joy with the caption, “#Hello my #firstlove when #Renée sings..my heart melts and dances in #gratitude. She truly sings from the heart...always has!!! Ever since her #musical #Maaaaa 17yrs ago she is her happiest when she's singing and always chooses the most difficult songs!!! Way to go!!!! we are all soooooo proud of her.” If this rendition is any indication, it looks like Renee has a promising singing career ahead of her.
