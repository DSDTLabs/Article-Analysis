KOLKATA: After Friday’s  , the state government is going to write to the  , since the other “friendly” states it had written to didn’t sound reassuring till Friday. A few days ago, Union home minister Rajnath Singh had said that the Centre would send forces only if the state wanted.

 
 Senior officials at   decided to knock on the Centre’s doors that they have been avoiding for all these days after it was revealed during stock-taking of the available forces and the ground reality on Thursday that there may be a deficit of 10,000-odd forces if the state has to adhere to the security format sent by the  . A section of officials also felt that the government should keep the MHA in the loop even while asking for forces from other states.
 
 Sources at Nabanna hinted that even a state like Telangana, whose chief minister enjoys a good rapport with the Bengal CM, is not sure of sending additional forces for the Bengal rural polls because it may have to send forces for the Karnataka assembly elections.
 
 With a little over 46,000 armed forces at its disposal, the state couldn’t plan a foolproof security cover for the polling booths and sensitive zones even after excluding the 11,016 polling booths that aren’t witnessing contest.
 
 The government is likely to make amends to its initial plan after getting a specific query sheet from the commission urging the state to specify deployment of forces under specific heads such as manning of polling booths in high sensitive and sensitive zones, providing forces for area domination ahead of the polls, manning strong rooms, counting centres and providing security to the 2 lakh-odd poll personnel to the polling stations across the state.
 
 All these along with the high court directive prompted the state government to keep a provision of requisitioning at least 10,000 armed forces from outside even after state representatives told the election commissioner in a meeting held at the state poll panel office last Friday that the state has adequate armed forces to man the 43,067 polling stations. But the state armed forces fall short when matched with what the State Election Commission wants — two armed personnel for each polling booth and not premises.
