NEW DELHI:  , chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s former principal secretary who has written to the chief secretary of Delhi seeking  , is in no mood to give up on his demand. 

 Waiting for an official response, the bureaucrat, who was suspended last July after his arrest by CBI in a case of alleged corruption, is even ready to move court. “No one has gotten back so far. Let us see. If they don’t give me voluntary retirement, I will seek legal recourse as laid out under the law to get my due,” Kumar told TOI on Friday. 
 
 In the letter to chief secretary   on January 4, Kumar has quoted rules to plead that his request be accepted within three weeks. As per process, Kutty would have to send the letter to the Union home ministry, the deciding authority in this case. A 1989-batch, AGMUT-cadre IAS officer, Kumar said he would wait for three months before going to court. 
 
 Kumar said he had stayed silent for so long as “I believed in the government system. But when I was victimised and that too by different agencies—CBI, I-T etc were unleashed on me—I decided it was time to speak up”. On the life after retirement, he said, “Official work is one part of life and there is life beyond it. I will continue to do public service in the best possible manner.” 
 
 In his letter to Kutty, Kumar said, “I have no personal knowledge of an honest, efficient officer being implicated in a false case, arrested, prosecuted and harassed in all imaginable and unimaginable manners.” CBI has defended its probe with an official claiming that it had “strong, irrefutable evidence” against Kumar. 
 
 An IIT Kharagpur alumnus like Kejriwal, Kumar was the CM’s most trusted bureaucrat. He was the first officer to be picked up by Kejriwal during the AAP government’s first 49-day tenure and was chosen again after the party’s victory in February 2015. Kumar has held some of the most critical postings under various governments.
