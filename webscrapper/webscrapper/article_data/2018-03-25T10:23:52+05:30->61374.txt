HYDERABAD: The Municipal Administration and Urban Development (MA&UD) department has issued a GO to take up the soil capping of   nagar landfill site at an estimated cost of Rs 144 crore.

 In a letter to the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation ( ) commissioner  , principal secretary of MAUD department   made it clear that the deadline to finish the work is June and the budget will not be extended further.
 
 “We are taking up permanent capping of the dumpyard. We will lay all layers to avoid mishaps,” said a top GHMC official.
 
 At a meeting held in July last year on the processing of municipal solid wastes in  , the private firm   stated their inability to complete the project due to financial constraints. They also urged civic authorities to revise the capital cost sharing between GHMC and the firm. In February this year, the commissioner had convened a meeting where it was recommended that the capping cost should be revised to Rs 144 crore.
 
 The estimated cost of the capping work escalated from Rs 59.39 crore in 2008-09 to Rs 106.67 crore in 2012 due to a rise in the amount of wastes by 10-12 million tonnes on 130 acres. Now, the cost has again jumped by Rs 37 crore with an additional area of around 27 acres coming under the project.
