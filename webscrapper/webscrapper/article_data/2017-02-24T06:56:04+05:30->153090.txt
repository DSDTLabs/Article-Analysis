THANE: Despite being assailed for lack of transparency and failed governance, the   has emerged victorious once again in Thane, emerging stronger than ever with 67 seats and a clear majority in the 131-seat municipal corporation (TMC). For local party strongman Eknath Shinde, it is a personal victory as this is the first time since 1997 that the party doesn't need anyone's support to run the TMC.

 The party secured four seats each in 12 of 33 wards across the city, including Diva, Wagle Estate and stretches along Ghodbunder Road. It got the remaining 19 from areas where its strategy to rope in sitting corporators from rival parties paid off. The fresh domains the Sena stormed include the Balkum panel, where it inducted former NCP leader and leader of opposition in the civic house   into the party fold. Yo gesh Jankar, another defector from the NCP, retained his seat in the Wagle Estate area, but this time for the Sena.
 
 The NCP has emerged as the second largest party in the TMC, securing 34 seats, and the BJP third, making impressive inroads with 23 seats. The Congress has been reduced to just three seats. The victory of two AIMIM candidates in Mumbra has come as a shock er for both the NCP and the Congress.
 
 As for the MNS, it appears to have been erased from the local political landscape as it has gone down from seven corporators to zero.
 
 But jubilation in the Sena camp was marred by big losses by sitting corporators including Mandar Vichare (nephew of Sena MP Rajan Vichare), Sumit Bhoir (son of Sena MLA Subhash Bhoir), party veteran Vilas Samant, former Thane mayor HS Patil, and Sanjay and   (brother and sister-in-law of former Thane mayor Anant Tare).
 
 Interestingly, NOTA (none of the above) was the first preference of several voters. Nearly 1,000 voters in ward 12B opted for NOTA, while 969 in ward 18A chose the option.
