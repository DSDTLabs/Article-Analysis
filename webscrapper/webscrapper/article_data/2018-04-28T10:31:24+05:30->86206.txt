DHARAMSHALA:   MP and former Union minister   on Friday exhorted the farm scientists to revive traditional crops with useful research and transfer of technology to farmers and other stakeholders. 

 Addressing scientists during 'Group Meet of All India Coordinated Research Network on Potential Crops' at Chaudhary Sarwan Kumar   Pradesh Agriculture University (HPAU), Palampur, the veteran BJP leader said it was essential to conduct research and make general masses aware about the importance of traditional crops which had been an essential part of daily diet a few decades back.
 
 He said it was difficult to find pure indigenous cattle breed in the country and same was the fate of highly nutritious traditional crops which have become extinct or were on the verge of extinction.
 
 He said neglecting agriculture has resulted in extremely stressful conditions among farmers, forcing many of them to commit suicide.
 
 Shanta appreciated the organizers for discussing underutilized but otherwise important crops for common farmers and general masses.
 
 Former HPAU vice-chancellor S K Sharma said it was possible to transfer useful genes of traditional crops to other crops through biotechnological tools.
