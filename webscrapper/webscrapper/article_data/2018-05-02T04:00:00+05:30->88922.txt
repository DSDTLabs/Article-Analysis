Rajkot: A massive blaze erupted at a house in Bhavnagar’s Pavthi village, leaving two members of a family dead and three others injured.

 The accident happened in the house of farm labourer Bhupat Solanki at around 2:20am on Tuesday when all were asleep. Solanki’s wife Varsha (28) and nine-year-old son Hitesh died in the accident while Solanki, who suffered nearly 80% burns, is said to be critical in Bhavnagar’s Sir T Hospital. 
 
 The fire also spread to the adjacent room where the couple’s two sons — Janak (10) and Bhargav (8) — were sleeping. However, they escaped with few burns on their hands and legs. The boys were admitted to a government hospital in Talaja town. All the mattresses, quilts and the cot were reduced to ashes in the fire.
 
 The neighbours who saw the blaze immediately called the 108 emergency ambulance and rushed them to the hospitals. Talaja police said they are uncertain about the exact cause of the blaze and FSL experts have been roped in for investigation.
 
 “There was no smell of kerosene in the house. But whether it was an accident, suicide or murder, will be known only after the forensic report arrives,” said S V Boricha, police sub-inspector at Talaja.
