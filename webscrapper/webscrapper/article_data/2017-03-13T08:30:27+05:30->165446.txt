JALANDHAR: While BSP was relegated to the third position in UP with just 19 seats out of the total 403, the party’s performance in Punjab was also nothing short of an embarrassment. Though BSP contested all 117 seats in Punjab, its state party president Avtar Singh Karimpuri was the only candidate not to have lost his security deposit. He finished at fourth place in Phillaur constituency.

 Punjab is the state which gave BSP one of its first MPs in 1989. Even the party’s founder Kanshi Ram, who was born in Punjab’s Ropar district, was an MP from Hoshiarpur Lok Sabha seat in 1996.
 
 In Phillaur, only seat in state where the contest was considered four-cornered, BSP’s votes came down from over 42,000 in 2012, to 28,035 votes this time. Baldev Singh Khaira was party candidate in 2012 but he left BSP to join SAD and the move helped him win the seat, defeating the Congress with margin of 3,517 votes.
 
 In 2012, eight BSP candidates had managed to save their security deposits. The party had polled 5,97,020 votes thus cornering 4.29% vote share in 2012, but this time around it got only 2,34,400 votes or 1.5%.
 
 In 1992 election, which was boycotted by the Akalis, BSP won nine seats and its vote share soared to 16.32%. However, the turnout in 1997, was barely 23.8%.
 
 In 1997, the BSP’s vote share was 7.48% and one of its candidates won. Now, 20 years down the line, the party’s vote share has plummeted to lowest ever.
 
 In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, BSP secured 1.9% votes. Poll analysts believed that the party lost its votes to AAP in 2014, which saw Arwind Kejriwal’s party winning 4 seats in Punjab.
 
 The last time BSP won an assembly seat was also in 1997, when Shingara Ram Shahungra won from Garhshankar, a general seat. Later, he too parted ways with the party.
 
 Several top leaders had left the party and 10 out of 12 candidates who had polled considerable number of votes in 2012 elections were not in the fray from BSP this time. Two SAD MLAs Pawan Teenu (in Adampur) and Baldev Singh Khaira (in Phillaur) are former BSP leaders and their career graph soared after they left BSP. While there has been strong feeling in the party to forge an alliance with a bigger party, but BSP supremo Maywati has been rejecting the idea.
 
 Sources revealed that BSP leaders and cadres were anguished over the poll outcome and in the coming days the party may witness more trouble during its internal meetings. “The leadership and its policies would be questioned in meetings as the top leaders have been refusing to forge an alliance and the party has come to this now. While BSP was responsible for major political awakening among Dalits, its leadership has failed it cadres and voters,” said a BSP leader.
