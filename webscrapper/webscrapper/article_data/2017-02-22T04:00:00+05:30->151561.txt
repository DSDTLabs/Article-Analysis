AHMEDABAD: The Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) has allowed screening of a Hindi film — ‘Hamein Haq Chahiye Haq Se’, based on ‘anti-reservation’ theme. The movie, which has many scenes reminiscent of the Patidar quota movement in  , has been cleared by the censor board but only after deleting the word ‘Patidar’ or ‘Patel’ whenever it is heard or seen. 

 The movie has got the U/A certificate after Pahlaj Nihalani-led censor board ‘beeped’ the ‘Patel’ or ‘Patidar’ which was used for over 25 times in the film. The name of the protagonist  , which sounds similar to PAAS convener  , too is heard as Harshad ‘Beep’ in the movie. 
 
 Himmat Ladumor, the Surat-based producer of the film, says his film got the censor nod as “it is in nation’s interest as it talks about abolition of reservation”. 
 
 Earlier, a Gujarati film “Anamat”, which was made on Patidar quota agitation last year, was not clearance by the board following which the director moved the   (FCAT) for appeal. The censor board had rejected the movie on grounds that “it may disrupt law and order and it may prove harmful to national security and integrity”. 
 
 Ladumor said that his film revolves around Gujarati boy Harshad Patel who is angered by the fact that while he faces difficulty in getting admission in good college and a government job, less meritorious candidates get preference due to 49% quota. “This triggers the protagonist’s war against quota system,” says Ladumor. 
 
 He said that the word Patel or Patidar has been deleted and muted from the movie. “I have also used a scene where in the protagonist is addressing a grand rally like one that had been addressed by Hardik Patel on August 25. However, deletion of Patidar word does not make any difference as my film talks about anti-reservation which is in the interest of the country,” he added
