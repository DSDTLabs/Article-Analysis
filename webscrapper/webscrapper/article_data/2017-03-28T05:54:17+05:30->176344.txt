HOWRAH: The   unit at  , which was closed two years ago, is set to reopen next week. The company authorities decided to open this 125-year old unit at   after a tripartite meeting with   Moloy Ghatak and representatives of the factory labour union.

 Ghatak told TOI: “I am very happy the authorities have decided to reopen the Asia's oldest paint factory unit. We had 11 meetings with the authorities and the government assured all sorts of help to the authorities if they reopened it. This is a very positive step towards the industrialization of the state. I am very happy with the development.“
 
 Three representatives from   (Mumbai) took part in the meeting.
 
 The unit was shut down after a devastating fire on March 12, 2014, that led to massive damage. The authorities decided to shut down the Bengal unit after the incident, alleging non-cooperation from the government and a section of the workers.The authorities claimed at the time that they needed Rs 7 crore to rebuild the factory and had asked for help from the state government but there was no response and they were compelled to shut down the unit.
 
 “The company will start in a week. The process of reopening will start on Tuesday and by the beginning of the next week, the unit will be ready. It was also decided that in the first phase, 25 permanent workers will be reinstated.Then, in phases, all the permanent workers and casual labours will be taken back,“ working president of INTTUC-run SShalimar Paints Workers' Union Masood Alam Khan said. “We are very happy this age-old company will start functioning again,“ he added.
