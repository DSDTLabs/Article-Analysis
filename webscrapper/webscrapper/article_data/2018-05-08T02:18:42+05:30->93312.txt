BENGALURU: Bharatiya Janata Party ( ) chief   is confident of winning the   assembly polls as he believes Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal popularity has helped the party tap “people’s anger” against the   government in the state.

 
 In a conversation with TOI, Shah alleged that the Congress government had failed the state on all counts — from infrastructure development and alleviation of farm distress to law and order.
 
 Shah alleged that chief minister Siddaramaiah had handed over Bengaluru, the state capital, to a troika of builders “George, Harris and Roshan Beigh” belonging to Congress.
 
 “Other governments may prefer one builder or the other, here it is the builders who have the state at their disposal,” the BJP president said.
 
 The PM’s popularity remained intact, Shah said, adding that BJP would garner 50% vote share in the country by 2019. “After 50%, there won’t be much left even for a combined opposition,” he said.
 
 Shah also said that Siddaramaiah’s move to recognise   as a non-Hindu community — suspected to be a move to split BJP’s staunch base among the community — had not worked because the CM’s intentions were seen as suspect.
 
 Shah defended the projection of B S   for the top office in Karnataka despite corruption charges against him, saying all allegations against the former CM were dismissed by a court which saw them as a frame-up.
