Visakhapatnam: A pro-poor emission reduction project was rolled out by the NGO Laya in eight agency mandals of Visakhapatnam and East Godavari to reduce carbon emissions from traditional  . 

 The project, Sarala Stove, certified by Gold Standard Foundation, headquartered in the Basel Agency for Sustainable Energy, embarked on its journey in East-Godavari in 2011 and four years later, it was expanded in Visakhapatnam. The stoves made of clay and ash, with built- in chimneys brought down 1.3 tonnes of carbon emissions per stobe every year, according to G Bulayya and D Lova Raju, local project managers of the NGO. 
 
 Speaking on the project, Bulayya said, “We are basically accessing the carbon credit market. The stoves are lent to users who pay back through carbon credits. One tonne of reduction is equivalent to one credit. We plan to make it a profitable venture and the whole idea is to use the profits, post loan clearance for community purpose.”As for the investment, Bulayya added that procuring each stove did cost Rs 1,000. Lova Raju said, “Around 10,000 tribal homes reap benefits from the project, for which the total cost is Rs two crore. It is a pro-poor project aimed at sustaining reduction in carbon emissions.”
 
 In the past six years the project has been implemented in the mandals of Addatheegala, Y Rayavaram, Rajavummangi Mandal and Gangavaram. In Visakhapatnam the project is gathering steam in Peddabayalu, Hukumpeta and G Madugula. As for the status of the project, Raju said, “Right now the loan is still being cleared through credits and we are drawing up a plan of action to distribute 70 per cent of the profits for community benefit.”
