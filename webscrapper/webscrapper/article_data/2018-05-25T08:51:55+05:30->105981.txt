CHANDIGARH: Two   residents were sentenced to five-year rigorous imprisonment in a case of attempted murder. The court of additional district and sessions judge Harish Anand convicted them under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 341(punishment for wrongful restraint) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

 The convicts have been identified as Jaswinder Singh and Neeraj alias Monu. The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 each on both. The matter dates back to January 22, 2018 when police personnel on patrol duty received a wireless message alerting them about a snatching incident on the road from Dhanas to Dadumajra. When the police team reached, it was found out that the injured had been shifted to GMSH, Sector 16. 
 
 According to the formal complaint filed, Jagat Bahadur, a resident of Dhanas and employee of a dhaba in the area, did not go to work that day. His wife, also an employee of the dhaba, filled in for him. The complaint stated that when he was on his way to pick her up at about 4:30pm, two men on a motorcycle stopped him and asked if he had a mobile phone, to which he refused. This led to an argument, in the course of which one of the youths attacked him with a sharp-edged weapon. Jagat Bahadur fell down and a passerby called the police.
 
 A case was registered against the accused at the Sector 11 police station. The accused were identified as  , 32, and Neeraj, 22, both residents of Mohaliâ€™s Padol village. After the arguments, the court held them guilty and sentenced them to five years in jail.
