Premier League leaders   have the most expensive squad in history, according to a research report. 

 
 
 The research values Pep Guardiolaâ€™s squad at 878 million euros (Rs 6,939 crore), with   second on 805 million euros (Rs 6,385 crore), after the January transfer window in which City acquired centre-back   from Athletic Bilbao for 65 million euros.
 
 Neymar's world-record signing from Barcelona accounts for more than a quarter of the PSG total but   is only on loan, despite an anticipated transfer fee of up to 180m euros to be paid to Monaco at the end of the season.
 
 That leaves Guardiola managing the costliest-ever collection of talent.
