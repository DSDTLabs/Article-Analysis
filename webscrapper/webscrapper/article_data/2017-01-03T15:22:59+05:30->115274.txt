NEW DELHI: Accusations and counter accusations flew thick and fast today as the 
  (SP) showed no signs of abating even as both warring factions battle over the party symbol, the cycle.

 Uttar Pradesh 
  's supporters say that he commands most of the SP lawmakers' support.
 
 "We have said to the Election Commission that 90% of MLAs are supporting   ji and hence party led by him must be considered as (the actual) SP," said 
  , who has stood firmly behind the Uttar Pradesh CM.
 
 In the meanwhile, Akhilesh supporter Kiranmoy Nanda, who was expelled January 1 by SP founder Mulayam, alleged that there was something dodgy about the signature on the expulsion letter.
 
 On the other side of the battle, 
  today that last Saturday's expulsion of Akhilesh and Ram Gopal was never revoked on paper, and was conditional upon Akhilesh not holding a convention. Because of these two reasons, Akhilesh and Ram Gopal are technically still disqualified. 
 
 This makes Mulayam's case stronger in the Election Commission because only the party president can call a convention, disqualified members can't.
