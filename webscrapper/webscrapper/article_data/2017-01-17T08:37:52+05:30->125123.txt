PANAJI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to field a candidate in Velim constituency for the first time. Vinay Tari will challenge independent MLA Benjamin Silva, who had supported the BJP government, during the last five years.

 The announcement of Tari as BJP candidate in Velim constituency makes it clear that the party will not support Silva, who had supported the BJP-led government in the state.
 
 BJP has also decided to field party treasurer Sanjeev Desai’s brother Sunil in Ponda constituency. Earlier, the party had announced the names of 29 candidates, including 19 sitting MLAs. BJP has still not decided on three constituencies including Nuvem, Benaulim and Navelim.
 
  In Navelim, BJP is likely to support independent candidate and fisheries minister Avertano Furtado and the party has declared its support to independent candidate Govind Gaude in Priol constituency.
 
 The fisheries minister on Saturday met the BJP core committee, which is headed by defence minister  , to seek the ruling party’s support in Navelim constituency. “The party has still not decided whether to support Furtado in Navelim constituency,” a senior BJP leader said.
 
 BJP’s Navelim block on Monday held a meeting with party leaders and strongly opposed supporting Furtado in the assembly elections. The block members want the party to consider the names of Shaikh Jina and Ulhas Tuvekar as probable candidates for the BJP ticket from Navelim. South Goa MP   told the Navelim mandal that the party will convey to them about the decision on Navelim seat.
 
 The ruling party tried to get Furtado to contest the elections on a BJP ticket, but Furtado refused the offer and decided to contest as an independent.
 
 Union AYUSH minister Shripad Naik said that decison on Nuvem, Benaulim and Navelim seats would be taken soon.
