Dharwad: The   has accused some officials of the water board of illegally supplying more than 2 lakh litres of   water to   every day. 

 Warning of a massive protest, Basavaraj Korawar, a representative of the Vedike, demanded that the deputy commissioner initiate a probe and take stern action against the water board officials who are hand in glove with the company.
 
  Korawar said that these officials supply water to Pepsi’s plant in Dharwad through illegal connections. Korawar claimed that the board is charging Pepsi Rs 23.20 for 1,000 litres of water while for the general public, the price is Rs 52 for the same quantity.
 
 “Dharwad is facing one the worst droughts in recent times and getting water regularly has become difficult for the general public. Under such circumstances, the water board, without installing meter, is supplying nearly 5-6 lakh litres of water to Pepsi every day at a subsidized rate,” Korawar alleged.
 
 He further alleged that the water board officials have misguided the deputy commissioner by stating that Pepsi is taking lesser than the quantum of water fixed in the agreement. Korawar said that people had protested last year, raising their voice against the illegal water supply to Pepsi.
 
  “Based on media reports, the   had filed a   case and served a notice on the water board. The officials gave false information to the KSHRC,” he said.
