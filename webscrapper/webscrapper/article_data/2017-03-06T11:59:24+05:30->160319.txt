VISAKHAPATNAM: The first sleep lab in the government set-up would be established in Andhra Medical College-King George Hospital soon and the equipment required for the sleep lab has also been ordered. In this regard, a day-long workshop on sleep disorder was conducted in   (AMC) seminar hall on Sunday where doctors from   (AIIMS), New Delhi, spoke on various topics related to sleep disorder.

 Chief guest of the workshop director of medical education (DME) Dr K Babji informed that setting up sleep labs in some of the government hospitals is the brain child of principal health secretary of AP Dr   and it would be initiated at KGH-AMC. Order has also been placed for the device for polysomnography required to find sleep pattern of patients by recording their brain waves.
 
 Speaking about it, principal of AMC Dr   said, “The sleep lab would be set up in the super-specialty block, probably attached to the neurology department. The patients complaining of sleep related issues would be put to sleep and the polysomnography machine would be connected to the patient. Thus sleep pattern can be traced through ECG-like graphs and cases of sleep apnoea or breathing difficulty while sleeping can also be found. Accordingly, treatment can be undertaken either through surgery or through altered lifestyle.”
 
 At Sunday’s workshop, attended by post graduate doctors and assistant professors from the departments of neurology, pulmonary medicine, general medicine, physiology and ENT, the doctors from AIIMS spoke on various types of sleep disorder, discussed to what extent knowledge about sleep disorder can be included in the medical curriculum and ways to manage sleep disorder. Around 75 doctors and delegates participated.
