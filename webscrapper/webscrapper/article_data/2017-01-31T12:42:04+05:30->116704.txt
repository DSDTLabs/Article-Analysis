Aamir Khan's Christmas release 'Dangal,' which also stars Fatima Sana Shaikh, Sanya Malhotra, Sakshi Tanwar, Zaira Wasim and Suhani Bhatnagar in key roles, is now the highest grossing Bollywood film of 2016 dethroning Salman Khan-starrer 'Sultan' which made Rs 300.45 crore at the domestic box-office. 

 
 
 The sports drama, co-written and directed by Nitesh Tiwari, continued its magical performance at the box-office on Day 13 as it added Rs 9.23 crore more to its kitty. The total collection of the film now stands at a monumental figure of Rs 304.38 crore. 'Dangal' is the first ever Bollywood film to achieve the remarkable feat in just 13 days. It is the fourth entrant to the prestigious Rs 300-crore club after 'PK,' 'Bajrangi Bhaijaan' and 'Sultan.' Even in its second week, the film performed so well that it collected over Rs 100 crore in just 6 days. 
 
 
 
 
 After having surpassed the lifetime collection of 'Sultan,' the question remains if the film will be able to beat the lifetime collection of 'PK' (Rs 340 crore) and emerge as the highest grossing Bollywood film ever. 
 
 
 
 'Dangal,' which is the last major Bollywood release of 2016, tells the story of Indian wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat and how he trained his daughters Geeta Phogat and Babita Kumari to become world-class wrestlers.
