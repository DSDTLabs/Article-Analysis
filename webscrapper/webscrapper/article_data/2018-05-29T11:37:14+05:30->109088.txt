SHIMLA: The   high   on Monday took suo motu cognizance of the acute water shortage in Shimla and directed the commissioner and municipal engineer of   to remain present in the court on Tuesday. The court directed the civic body to file a status report on the matter.

 While hearing a petition on acute shortage of portable water in the hill town, a division bench of acting Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Ajay Mohan Goel said the problem of water scarcity within Shimla town, as highlighted, “takes the court to yet another issue and that being as to whether any new construction should be allowed to come up within the municipal limits of Shimla town at all or not”.
 
 “Whether the present holding capacity is sufficient enough to cater to the ever growing urban population or not, is an issue which certainly needs to be addressed,” the bench observed.
 
 During the hearing, proxy counsel invited the attention of the court to the problem of acute shortage of water, which the residents of Shimla town are facing for the last eight days. 
 
 The advocate general stated in the court that the highest authority was already seized of the matter and appropriate steps were being taken for immediate redressal of the problem.
 
 The court said that it was fully in agreement with the submissions made by the advocate general that long term solution to the problem could be found with the construction of check dams and reservoirs where water can be stored for longer period of time and utilized at the time of water scarcity, more so, during summer months.
 
 Protesting the prevailing water scarcity on for almost a week, advocates of the high court and district court abstained from the court work.
