PATNA: At least 40 top state   functionaries, including former deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi and leader of opposition in assembly Prem Kumar, addressed the party’s dharna organised in various districts in protest against state government’s alleged failure to curb crime and other issues.

 Modi addressed the party dharna at Sasaram while Kumar at Biharsharif. The BJP leaders spoke on   as well as mismanagement of paddy procurement and rice purchase from farmers, among other issues, said party’s state vice-president and MLC Lal Babu Prasad here.
 
 Modi alleged government laxity in paddy procurement as it did not provide for payment of bonus to farmers. Also, funds were not transferred to   to procure paddy from farmers. Besides, the   did not open centres to purchase rice, Modi added.
 
 Among others who also addressed the dharna at their allotted places were national vice-president Renu Devi (Raxaul), national secretary Rajneesh Singh (Samastipur), state vice-president Mithilesh Tiwari (Gopalganj), general secretaries Sanjeev Chaurasia (Arwal) and Sudhir Kumar Sharma (Barh), MLC Dilip Jaiswal (Bhagalpur), MLA Anil Singh (Munger), MLC Krishna Kumar Singh (Nawada), former minister Nitish Mishra (Jhanjharpur), chief spokesman Vinod Narayan Jha (Madhubani) and spokesman Sanjay Singh Tiger (Buxar).
 
 Kumar alleged government failure to contain law and order and its connivance with criminals. “Cases of murder, rape, loot etc have gone up many folds in Nalanda, the home turf of CM Nitish Kumar, and elsewhere in the state,” he said at Biharsharif.
 
 He claimed rule of law only in BJP-ruled states. “Under the leadership of PM  , India is moving on the path of development,” he said. Referring to the alleged paper leak in the SSC examination held on February 5, he said he would raise the issue in the assembly.
