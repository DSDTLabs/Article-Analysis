MADURAI: Farmers in the district have called for transparency in co-operative elections scheduled for April alleging that the preparatory works tend to be favouring the ruling party. The allegation was raised during the farmers’ grievance redressal meeting held at collector office on Friday. 

 State sugarcane farmers’ leader   said that there was no transparency in the election works. However, officials of the cooperatives department dispelled all fears in this regard saying that there was an independent election commission to conduct the elections and the exercise would be free and fair. The farmers alleged that works were not provided to villagers under National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme. Madurai Collector K   who presided over the meeting said that there were some salary issues which have been resolved. Summer works would be given in all villages under NREGP, he said.
 
 During the meeting, the farmers’ delegation which inspected the 58th Channel works at  , as requested by collector during the last meeting, said that the works were satisfactory. TNN
