NEW DELHI: The CAG cites severe discrepancies in the implementation of registration and digitisation of beneficiaries under the National Food   Act, 2013. The CAG came down strongly on the department of food, supplies and consumer affairs, and said that it “did not independently verify eligibility of National   Security (NFS) card applicants and relied on their declaration that none of their family members belongs to non-eligible categories”.

 The report states that the audit found that applicants with Aadhaar card issued by other states became NFS beneficiary in Delhi without due verification of whether they are NFS beneficiary in their home states or not.
 
 It was also noted that vehicles used for transportation of specified food articles included those registered as buses, scooters, motorcycle and three-wheelers which raises doubts on the authenticity of the reported transportation.
 
 The audit also found that a total of 792 fair price shop licence holders were also NFS beneficiaries themselves and were receiving ration. “The department replied that zonal offices would verify the eligiblity of these NFS cards and take necessary steps,” it stated.
