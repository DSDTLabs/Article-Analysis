NEW DELHI: Engine trouble on the Airbus A-320 new engine option (Neo) shows no signs of abating.

 On Saturday, an   A-320 Neo developed a snag in one of the engines, manufactured by aircraft engine makers  . “The aircraft (VT-ITC) got a ‘oil chip detected’ warning for one engine at Vadodara. It had to be flown back as a ferry (without passengers) to Delhi on Sunday for engine change,” said a source.
 
 IndiGo did not comment on this latest trouble with this engine. Till the time of filing this story, it could not be ascertained at what stage of flight the latest engine trouble with   happened.
 
 Saturday’s trouble is the fourth in less than a month with both IndiGo and GoAir – that use A-320 Neos with P&W engines – reporting two engine issues each. IndiGo A-320 neo on Saturday reportedly got an “oil chip” warning similar to the one that was witnessed by a GoAir A-320 Neo which had taken off from Delhi for Bangalore on February 8 and had to return to Delhi after a fire scare on an engine.
 
 P&W spokesperson Sara Banda told TOI: "Pratt & Whitney is supporting GoAir and IndiGo to assess the situation and minimize any disruption. At this time, it is premature to speculate on the cause of the issues while they are still under review. We are working closely with our customers and our suppliers in order to address and resolve these issues quickly. The PW GTF (geared turbofan engine) engines are a game-changing, break-through technology with more than 82,000 hours in service.”
 
 Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) chief B S Bhullar had recently said that the regulator is studying the engine trouble on the Neo. The A-320 is the most commonly used plane in India with airlines like IndiGo, Air India, GoAir and Vistara using this equipment.
