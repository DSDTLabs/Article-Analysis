Ahmedabad: The Gujarat State Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission has quashed an order passed by a consumer forum in Surendranagar directing the Regional Passport Officer (RPO) to pay Rs 2.5 lakh to an engineer for not issuing him passport within stipulated time, and for notional loss of a job abroad.

 The consumer commission has held that a passport is not a commodity which is purchased or sold for consideration, but is only in the nature of a permission granted by the sovereign to its citizens to go outside the country. Hence issuance of passport is not covered under the consumer protection law.
 
 In January 2014, the district consumer forum asked the RPO to pay compensation to one Krunal Khakhi from Thangadh after he claimed that he missed the opportunity to earn a salary of $1,500 per month due to delayed procedure in issuing the passport. 
 
 The district consumer forum held that it was deficiency in service on part of the RPO. However, this view has been reversed by the state consumer commission. It said that issuance of passport by the Centre under the Passport Act is a sovereign act, which has to be performed by the authorities according to the rules and regulations framed under the law.
