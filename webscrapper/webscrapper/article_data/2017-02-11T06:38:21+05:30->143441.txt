AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court ordered that an executive magistrate from Gandhinagar, Bhavesh Modi, must execute a   of Rs 20 lakh and an equal amount as surety to get 34 bank  , of his and his relatives,  .

 On Thursday, the HC ordered so because the aggregate amount in these 34 bank accounts is Rs 20 lakh. The official has been asked to furnish the bond and surety in a weekâ€™s time.
 
 These bank accounts were ordered to be frozen by the anti-corruption bureau after the revenue department official was found to have wealth and money excessive to his known sources of income. In June last year, Modi was not only charged for corruption, but also booked under the recently much-talked about Benami Transaction Prohibition Act.
 
 During the probe, the investigating officer found suspicious transactions by Modi in 34 accounts of different banks, belonging to Modi and his close relatives. ACB asked the concerned banks to block all the accounts and they were accordingly frozen.
 
 Modi and his father Dahya Modi unsuccessfully approached the special court in Gandhinagar with a request to unfreeze the accounts. They moved the HC with an argument that police do not have the power to direct banks to freeze accounts, and a case of disproportionate wealth can only be proved from entries effected in books of accounts so as to trace past bank dealings. Freezing accounts does not serve any purpose except to cause difficulties to the account holders, they argued.
 
 The state government submitted that the accounts would not remain frozen indefinitely, but at least till the chargesheet was filed. Of the 34 accounts, details of past entries have been obtained for 27 accounts. The investigator expects that many more such accounts may surface as the probe goes further, additional public prosecutor Nisha Thakore submitted.
 
 The government proposed that Modi be asked to execute a bond of an amount equal to all the money in the 34 accounts.
