HYDERABAD: In spite of the   station being an arterial one, it doesn't have a lost and found office. Forgotten luggage and other articles are put in the loft of the   station. With few claimants for the luggage, most bags are damaged by rodents.

 A police official at the railway station said, “The railway staff and policemen on duty bring several bags every day. In most cases they are not claimed. We keep these bags on the loft and wait for few months and destroy them later. Most of the bags have clothes. Rats spoil them on the loft.” In a few cases police find important items left behind by passengers, but there is no mechanism to save them.
 
 According to the manual of   under the section ‘Lost property and unclaimed consignments’ all empty carriages of incoming trains should be carefully checked at terminal stations by a responsible member of the station staff along with a representative of the   to see if any property has been left behind by passengers. Any article found should be deposited with the station master.
 
 The manual also says, “If articles of lost or unclaimed property, other than booked consignments, are deposited by any person, the station master should take over and grant receipts for such articles. An inventory must be taken when necessary without undue delay, and attested by the person making over the property.”
