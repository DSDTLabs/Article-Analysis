VARANASI: UP agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi said that a list of 1.50 crore farmers had been finalized and sent to chief minister   to take a decision for the agriculture loan waiver as per the pre-poll promise of  . All district magistrates have been directed to make sure that no waste is burnt in fields after harvesting of wheat crop, he added. 

 Talking to reporters here on Sunday, Shahi said that the CM will take a decision to waive the agriculture loans of the farmers included in this list in the first cabinet meeting expected any day in this week. The work on preparing the list of beneficiaries had been started immediately after the formation of the government. Wheat purchase centres are being set up to meet the target of purchasing 80 lakh metric tonnes of wheat from the farmers. 
 
 These centres are being established in such a way that farmers do not travel more than seven kilometres with their produce to sell wheat. Shahi said that the target of wheat purchase by   government was 40 lakh mt but Yogi has increased the target to double. He said that minimum support price for wheat crop has also been fixed as Rs 1,625 per quintal.
 
 Shahi said that increased target has also increased the challenges of storage as presently the warehouses have the capacity of storing only 40 lakh mt in the state. Alternative sites like closed and unused cold storages are being explored to store wheat. He said that all these exercises are being made to fulfil the promise ofPM Narendra Modi to double the income of farmers by 2022. 
 
 He said that soil health test laboratories are presently working only in 30 districts. Efforts are on to make such centres available in every district. He said that the faculties in all five agriculture universities are going to be increased.
