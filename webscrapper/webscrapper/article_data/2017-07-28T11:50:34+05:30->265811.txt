VASCO: The annual Vasco   (7-day event) will begin with the installation of a shreefal (coconut) at Damodar temple by Paresh Joshi, eldest son of late Vasant Joshi, on Friday afternoon.

 The ritual will be followed by 24-hour bhajan recitations besides other festivities. Every year, the Saptah commences on the sixth day of Shravan (6th day of Hindu calendar month Shravan).
 
 History has it that in 1899, plague claimed several lives in the port town and its outbreak was uncontrollable. A couple of Hindu families then proceeded to   seeking divine intervention of lord Damodar. They carried along with them a Shreefal as symbolic gesture and installed it at the temple, which practice continues even today. Thereafter, Vascoites regained their health and lord Damodar became their protector.
 
 The beginning of Saptah marks float processions by six groups enacting scenes from Hindu mythology. The group includes Falwale, Nabhik samaj,   samaj, Bajarkar samiti, Vishwakrma samaj and   samaj.
 
 Amid chanting of shlokas and singing of hymns, the processions (Dindi) converge at the temple precincts from six different locations. Dancing to the tune of drum beats, devotees chant ‘Gyanba Tukatram’ and other devotional hymns.
 
 In view of the festivities, Vasco police have beefed up security arrangements and pressed into service additional staff from   police and Indian Reserve Battalion. Eight watch towers have been installed to have an overview of the fair route. CCTVs have been installed at watch towers, specific locations and temple precincts. Devotees entering temple will have to pass through the metal detector.
 
 The Mormugao municipality too has geared up to make city’s biggest event a major success.
