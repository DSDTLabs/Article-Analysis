Chandigarh: For paying the seventh Pay Commission wages to its employees, Punjab Engineering College ( ), deemed to be university, has made a draft of the fee-hike slabs for four years from 2019-23, since it plans to generate revenue from internal sources.

 Four years of fee hike is on the table for approval. The authorities proposed a 12% hike for academic session 2019-20, considering various factors. The proposal says that the institute meets its expenses from grants and the proposed hike from the session 2018-19 and subsequent five academic years is for new students. The authorities said the fee hike was necessary on account of inflation, effect of 7th Pay Commission recommendations, proportionate enhancement in pension and related liabilities, and the expenditure on hiring teachers, building new centres, and creating new posts on self-support basis.
 
 Referring to the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the National Institutes of Technology (NIT) in the proposal, the PEC authorities stated that these elite engineering institutes had also enhanced their fee structure in the undergraduate programmes. In the PEC proposal, there is no fee hike for the postgraduate courses, for which the institute is desperate to attract talent.
 
 The undergraduate courses of the PEC are its USP and far cheaper than the programmes of the other government institutes. Recently the proposal was moved to the PEC the board of governors for consent but the board returned it for reconsideration before the next meeting.
