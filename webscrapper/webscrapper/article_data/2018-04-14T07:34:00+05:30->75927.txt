Bathinda: Jaurkian police in Mansa district have registered a case of cheating against a godman Kulbir Singh of duping a man of Rs 11.5 lakh. The fraudster cheated Gurwinder Singh of Beerewala Jatta village claiming that a lot of gold was been buried around their house and he would use his celestial powers to lead him to it. Kubir hails from Joia village and was residing in Fatehabad town of Haryana.

 He extracted the money from his victim in two instalments in the last two years, saying it was needed for organizing a series of special prayers to find the hidden treasure. Kulbir told Gurwinder’s family that they could get the buried gold only if they succeed in pleasing the gods. The family had complete faith in him and paid him money by selling off an acre of land out of their three acres.
 
 The family had so much faith in Kulbir that they kept on waiting for nearly two years to get the gold through him. On Thursday, Gurwinder made the complaint to the police after Kubir stopped taking their calls on his mobile phone.
 
 Jaurkian SHO Harpreet Singh said Kulbir used to visit a peerkhana (tomb) at Joia village where Gurwinder’s family came in contact with him. “Kulbir visited their home at Beerewala Jatta and told them that gold was buried around their home. He told them it could be obtained by paying some money and duped the family of Rs 11.5 lakh which family raised by selling a part of the land. A case of cheating has been registered against Kulbir and efforts are being made to arrest him.”
