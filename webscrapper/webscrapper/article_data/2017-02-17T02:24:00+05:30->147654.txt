NEW DELHI: The families of the accused who were acquitted could barely hide their sense of relief. 

 Mohammed Rafiq Shah, cleared of all charges, was 22 years old and and a final year MA student when he was arrested. His mother, trying hard to hold back her tears, said her son was in his class in Srinagar during the blasts. "Today, I feel the same way that I felt when I gave birth to him. I feel he is born again," she said.
 
 Rafiq’s father said he was always proud of his son. He recalled that he always stood first in his class and had aspired for a PhD in Islamic Studies, but November 21,   changed all that. "His father spent a lot of money in buying books for him whenever he was in Delhi. Rafiq would be ready with a long list and spent the 12 years in jail imbibing whatever he could through books," said Rafique’s brother-in-law, requesting anonymity.
 
 A shy Iqbal, brother of Mohammed Hussain Fazli, now 36, tried to evade reporters unsuccessfully. "Fazli is my elder brother. Right before the police arrested him, he had had a gall bladder operation and was recuperating." Iqbal tries to ponder over the family’s loss because of Fazli’s long absence. "There were several deaths in the family but he was not there and, in fact, does not remember half the faces," he said. He had been a shawl weaver and trader. "When we take him home, the ordeal of 12 years will vanish, but we can never feel what he has undergone."
 
 Tariq Ahmed Dar, the alleged mastermind, has spent 12 years behind bars along with the other two. On Dar being acquitted of heinous charges like murder, conspiracy and terrorism, his brother, Ayub, said: "We knew about his innocence from day one." He said had a great career ahead of him as a district manager at Johnson & Johsnson. "Though he has lost the golden years of his life, we hope that he soon walks free to see his two young daughters."
