MUMBAI:   has sacked   B R Vaidya for allegedly misappropriating Rs 43 lakh he had collected as fine from unauthorized travellers. He had been siphoning cash since 2015, CR officials said.

 Vaidya was suspended and a penalty chargesheet issued to him on December 15. “We passed his dismissal order a week ago,” said a CR official. “We have recovered Rs 15 lakh from him. We will recover the balance amount from his retirement benefit funds. Besides, his wife is also a ticket-checker, so recovery may not pose a problem.” Sources said Vaidya’s wife was unaware of his misdeeds. “We will now lodge a complaint against Vaidya with GRP for cheating the railways,” said the official. 
 
 Besides Vaidya, chief ticket inspectors D S Pawar and S N Patil, and head train ticket examiner V S Kitake have also been issued penalty chargesheet for slack supervision. They have not been dismissed.
