MUZAFFARNAGAR: As police tightened its noose around suspects who allegedly played a role in the recent Dalit agitation, arresting scores of them on the charges of inciting violence, a group of 40 lawyers have come forward to "fight for the victims, many of whom are innocent but are being thrown into jails". According to these lawyers, four teams, each comprising 10 lawyers each, will look into the cases filed in four separate police stations. The lawyers - 11 of them Muslims and the remaining Dalits - have decided to fight these cases for free. So far, 70 people have been arrested and sent to jail in 30 cases filed against them in   district alone. 

 Speaking with TOI, Muzaffarnagar-based lawyer   said there are nearly 400 Dalit lawyers practising in the district and sessions court. "Some of them volunteered to provide free assistance to the accused, who are innocent and cannot afford a lawyer. We are not charging any fee," he said. 
 
 Another lawyer,  , who is part of the group, said, "At present, I am working for five accused who were arrested on April 2. All of them are of little means and had nowhere to go as far as seeking legal remedy was concerned." Senior lawyer   said, "I worked on one of the cases and two of the accused have already got bail. But let me make it clear that we will not help any of those offenders who have been caught on CCTVs or mobile clips taking part in the violence."
 
 According to superintendent of police (city) Omveer Singh, police are closely examining all mobile phone clips and CCTV footage available to identify the offenders. So far, 70 of them have been sent to jail and 30 cases have been registered in four different police stations of the district.
