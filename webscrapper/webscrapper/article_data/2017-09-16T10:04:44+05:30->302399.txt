NAGPUR: Public sector Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd on Friday re-activated the wi-fi connections of 500 gram panchayats in Nagpur district that were disconnected over non-payment of bills. The relief was given after a part-payment of Rs 2 crore was made by the district administration against the outstanding of Rs 7.97 crore.

 Nagpur district boasted of becoming the first in the state to have almost all its gram-panchayats wi-fi connected under the   push proposed by prime minister Narendra Modi. The digitial district was launched in August but the dream lasted less than an year.
 
 The government managed to pay the bills only till November last year and defaulted on subsequent bills for the services rendered. After repeated reminders and notices sent by the local BSNL office and even pursuing of the matter by chief general manager in Mumbai with Mantralaya officials failed to evoke any response, the wi-fi connectivity was snapped.
 
 BSNL had actually decided to cut the connection in March only but the district administration requested it to continue in the event of Prime Minister Narendra Modiâ€™s visit in April. 
 
 District collector   claimed that only public wi-fi connections were snapped while internet at gram panchayat and other government offices was never disconnected. He also claimed that because of availability of internet in villages, over 1.5 lakh farmers could register online for the loan waiver scheme in the past two months. The work for land record registration was also unaffected.
 
 Kurve admitted there were initial problems with provisioning of funds for Digital India programme. Now the state government is making budgetary allocations from   (single window documents provision system), he said.
