NEW DELHI: Responding to DDA’s proposed changes to the master plan, both BJP and   have sought further relief for  .   is yet to submit its final representations. 

 Delhi BJP vice-president Rajiv Babbar and spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, in their submission, objected to the parking clause, claiming that the issue concerned the entire city and local shopping complexes should not be singled out.   has proposed “to provide uniform FAR in shop-cum-residence plots/complexes at par with residential plots as given on mixed use street, which will depend on size of the plot and subject to availability of parking”.
 
 The party said there was no connection between parking and commercial activities in local shopping complexes. “There is neither feasibility nor any possibility to provide parking as per the master plan, as these are premises allotted as shops on ground floor and providing stilt or ground-floor parking will finish their business (sic).”
 
 Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president  , on the other hand, said there was no justification in imposing annual conversion charges for more than 10 years. The “rates as calculated in regulations of 2006, and amended on June 22, 2007, clearly indicate that annual conversion charges were for 10 years and the one-time conversion charge was eight times the annual charge. These shopping centres had parking spaces earmarked for them at the time of their creation,” Maken said.
 
 Maken added that a minimum FAR of 250 was available to LSC/shop-cum-residences even under MPD 1962. He said apart from Delhi government, DDA, too, should be authorised to notify the 351 streets in question.
