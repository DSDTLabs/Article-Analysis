 "A thing that stood out to me even in the comic books was that he is a strategist; he's a leader, a world leader. That's a responsibility that superheroes don't commonly have."
 
 "It's a conflict that they don't commonly have. He has to look out for an entire nation. Then also consider the nation's place in the world and how they affect the rest of the world."

 "Part of what I wanted to make sure is that there is some legitimate African movement and African martial arts present to tell the story of Wakanda as a military nation as well."
 
 "And they have been completely open to all of that stuff. Sometimes it felt like we were training for a real fight. So that was fun," he said. 'Black Panther', directed by  , also stars   and  .
