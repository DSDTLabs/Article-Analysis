CHENNAI: There should not be any construction activity on the   and authorities must ensure that there was no construction on or encroachment of the tank as well as the bund abutting the lake,   said on Tuesday. 

 The orders passed by the first bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Justice M Sundar on a   that was filed based on a TOI report, will now ensure that the lake and its tail-end areas remained free of encroachers and no illegal buildings are constructed. 
 
 In his PIL, advocate S Vaidyanathan, who is also a resident of the area, sought a direction to the authorities to repossess the government lands forming part of the   Lake from the illegal occupants, and restore the lake and its tail-end areas to its original extent and size and maintain it properly.
 
 He said that during every monsoon the Chitlapakkam Lake would overflow and that since there was no proper outlet for the flood water, it would inundate all main arterial road and layouts of the area surrounding it, causing untold hardship to the residents who have constructed houses after obtaining due permission and approvals from the civic authorities. This was all the more grave during the year 2015 during the Chennai floods and the main roads of Chitlapakkam were flooded for almost a week.
 
 The main cause for the misery faced by the residents due to the flooding was the uncontrolled construction and rampant encroachment on the lake's banks, the PIL said. It also said the local authorities apparently connived with the violators and turned a blind eye in spite of repeated representations from residents like him who were adversely affected by the consequences of these constructions, he added.
 
 The occupation of the water body was not only illegal but leading to growing water shortage in Chitlapakkam and surrounding areas where approved residential layouts have been developed, Vaidyanathan said in the petitikon. About 45,000 people were dependent on the lake for replenishment of ground water, which was sole source of water for them, as there was no regular water supply provided by the Chitlapakkam Town Panchayat, the petition said.
