AHMEDABAD: The minister of state for home and in-charge of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, Pradeepsinh  , has in a coordination meeting with MLAs and MPs instructed the corporation officials to ensure that the city does not get waterlogged during monsoon.

 Jadeja said, “AMC officials have been asked to ensure that the monsoon action plan was properly implemented so that the people don’t face hardships during the rains.”
 
 A senior officer said that apart from the monsoon action plan, MLAs complained that some officials were not providing information to the MLAs and MPs. They demanded that strict action should be taken against such officers.
 
 Jagdish Panchal Nikol MLA complained against a planning officer. He however, later had a meeting with the municipal commissioner and Jadeja over taking action against the officer.
 
 Apart from this,   Gyasuddin Shaikh said that there is a vacant plot in Kalupur and the same should be used for creating separate drainage and drinking water pumping station. He also demanded that the AMC cannot solve the issue of polluted water in the city, it should request the state government to sanction special package for Ahmedabad to deal with the problem.
 
  Balram   demanded that the AMC which is constructing the flyover at Naroda crossroads should extend the same for another 1.5 km so that other important crossings in the area are covered and the issue of traffic jams solved in the area.
 
 During the meeting, Thawani and a planning officer had a heated argument over road repairs. When Thawani demanded that the road near   should be immediately repaired, an officer said that the work was under progress. But Thawani then asked the officer to accompany him to the spot for investigation. However, later the matter was settled and the officials were asked to carry out repairs at the earliest.
