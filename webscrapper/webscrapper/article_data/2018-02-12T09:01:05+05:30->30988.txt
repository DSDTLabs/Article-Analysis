MAPUSA: Water leakage from a PWD water pipeline over several months in the Mapusa market has resulted in a huge amount of water wastage.

 Locals have criticized the Mapusa municipality and the PWD for turning a blind eye to the water leakage and failing to find a solution to this problem.
 
 TOI observed that the overflowing water has been released into a small nullah located in the Mapusa market. A vigilant citizen highlighted this issue by posting a photo of the water wastage on a WhatsApp group to create awareness about the same.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the citizen, Mahesh  , a lawyer by profession, said that an underground water supply pipeline was damaged during refurbishing work of the drains which was undertaken by the Goa state urban development agency (GSUDA).
 
 “There is no sufficient water supply to the people of Mapusa and here water is getting wasted unnecessarily. This is an irony,” Rane said.
 
 “The authorities who had undertaken the work of refurbishing the nullah should have also seen to it that the broken pipeline is repaired. Water wastage is a burning issue in many parts of Mapusa,” he added.
 
 He further said that the municipality will place the blame on the GSUDA, who, in turn, will blame the municipality, but the water wastage will continue. Ward councillor   said that the current office bearers have been very negligent towards their duties regarding supervision and accountability towards the ongoing projects. 
 
 “I pointed this out on numerous occasions, but departmental action has been very lousy and inadequate to tackle such a menace,” she said. 
 
 TOI’s attempts to contact   chairperson   were futile.
