JAIPUR: After a decline in occupancy for five consecutive years,   seems to be coming to its own. This year, the royal luxury train is set to overtake its previous peak occupancy of 79% witnessed in 2011-12.

 “For 2018-19, we already have an assured bookings of 63%. We have time till April 30 for the bulk buying scheme. We are very much confident to reach an occupancy mark of 80% for 2018-19,”said Subodh Agarwal, additional chief secretary, tourism, culture, environment and forest.
 
 The department has launched a scheme for bulk booking by the general sales agents ( ). Under the scheme, GSAs selling 50% of the occupancy on 10 departure dates get an enhanced commission of 32% against the normal rates of 17%. For advanced bookings, they will have to deposit 20% of the ticket money.
 
 In 2017-18, Palace On Wheels ( ) had an occupancy of 61% which revered the downward slide that started from 2012-13.
 
 From September last year,   (RRoW) has been converted into PoW. Consequently, PoW has been rechristened as   on Wheels but the age of the train is approaching its codal life of 25 years.
 
 But Agarwal said that factoring in the distance the train has clocked in these years, there is still a good 8-10 years of life left for the   on Wheels.
 
 “We will run and market the train for next atleast eight years. The train does not cover distances like any normal train as it seasonal,” added Agarwal.
 
 PoW is rated as one of the top 10 luxury train journeys in the world. Recently, it bagged a PATWA (Pacific Area Travel Writers Association) award in ITB Berlin. It offers a heart-rending trip to the splendid forts and palaces of Rajasthan in just seven days.
