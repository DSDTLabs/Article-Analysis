IMPHAL: Condemning the recent attack on a group of twelve Manipuri youths on a train travelling from New Delhi to Guwahati, chief minister   has urged Union home minister   to take necessary steps to safeguard people from the northeast, said a statement issued by the CM's secretariat. 

 Sources said the Manipuri youths were attacked inside the train by some Hindi-speaking passengers a couple of days ago in Bihar.
 
 Biren, who is currently staying in New Delhi for an official visit, urged the home minister to issue necessary directives to all states, railways authorities and security forces for providing adequate security to prevent any assault or misbehaviour with specific regard to people of the northeast.
 
 The CM also apprised the Union railways minister Piyush Goyal and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to take up appropriate action in this regard, added the statement.
 
 Biren further instructed the state chief secretary and DGP to contact their counterparts to ensure the safety and security of the northeast people and Manipuris in particular outside the state. The CM appealed to the general public to inform the government of any such incident in time so that the state government can initiate timely action, the statement said.
