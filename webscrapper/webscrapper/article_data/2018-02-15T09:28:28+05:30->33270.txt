SURAT: The   (SMC) plans to reduce its offtake from   by 10% this summer from current supply of 1,150-1170 million litre per day (MLD). However, the civic body assured that there will be   despite the decreased offtake from Ukai as it will be plugging in the water loss in various zones of the city. 

 Hydraulic department of SMC said it will continue supply of 150 litre per capita per day (LPCD) water throughout the summer, but curtail users using very high amount of water. 
 
 “Our single focus this year is on curtailing use of excess water. There are many areas where consumption is higher due to number of reasons like proximity to main line and other factors. Areas at the tail end of the network get less supply of water. Our focus will be on correcting the losses,” SMC commissioner M Thennarasan said.
 
 Traditionally it is witnessed that areas like Varachha, central zone and even parts of Udhna zone consume more water than others zones. “We are working on an equitable water distribution system by which excess water supply can be curtailed. This will help reduce offtake from Ukai by at least 100 MLD,” additional city engineer, SMC, K H Khatwani said. 
 
 Khatwani further said they plan to raid   and closed them.
 
 Sources in SMC said apart from supplying 756 MLD of water to nearly 13 lakh households, SMC supplies 75 MLD to industry, 64 MLD to commercial and 55 MLD to its own establishments. The civic body estimates water losses to be 20% due to line loss and illegal connections. 
 
 “By cutting off the excess water to certain excess supply areas we would be able to bring out requirement by 10%,” Khatwani said.
