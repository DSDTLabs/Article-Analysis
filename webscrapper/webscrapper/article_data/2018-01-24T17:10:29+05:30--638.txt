Priyadarshini Chatterjee,  , was the showstopper for designer duo Rohit Gandhi and Rahul Khanna on the final day of the Dream Diamonds Delhi Times Fashion Week. She was quite excited to be part of the show. “This is the first time I walked for the Delhi Times Fashion Week and it was almost like homecoming to me.” Priyadarshini was a student of Hindu College and is now studying in Mumbai. “I could only come to Delhi twice last year. I love Delhi so much and what I miss the most in Mumbai is Delhi’s winter season. This city has its own charm. Since I have changed my college and I study in Mumbai now, I miss my friends, college and food here. I am in touch with my teachers and friends though,” she added.
