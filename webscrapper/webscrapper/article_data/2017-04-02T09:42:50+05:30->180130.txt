VIJAYAWADA: A nod from chief minister N   and advocate general   will be crucial for the Vijayawada police to challenge the verdict in the   rapemurder case.

 “The ball is in Naidu’s court. We have been telling that Satyam is not the accused and that the erstwhile Congress government had sabotaged the evidence and influenced police investigation,” a top TDP leader told TOI. Naidu, who was an opposition leader in 2007, had promised Ayesha’s mother   that his party would fight against the Congress government to get justice. Shamshad Begum expressed happiness over the latest high court verdict and said that Satyam Babu was wrongly implicated for her daughter’s murder. “The police showed Satyam Babu as the culprit, but failed to explain how he managed to scale the compound wall with a boulder and enter the first floor of the hostel building,” she said. She also wondered why the police did not come up with evidence to support their claim that Ayesha had been raped twice. “Here is my straight question to the police. When the HC found that there is no proper evidence to prove that my daughter was raped twice, how can the sessions court claim that she was abused twice? Where is the DNA evidence? They were in a hurry to close the case by making an innocent youth the scapegoat,” she said. She alleged that main accused   and his friends circulated cock and bull stories to mislead the probe.
