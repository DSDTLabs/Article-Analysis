 The 31% cut in the nutrition budget has drawn the sharpest reaction from activists. In the last budget, there was a massive 62% in funding to the ICDS scheme, which oversees malnutrition programmes. “Last year, only half the budget cut was reversed after protests. Maharashtra needs to spend much more on nutrition given that it has 88,000 severely malnourished children,” said Abhijit More from Jan Arogya Abhiyan. Activists also said that the government spent less on food security per person than other states. In the new budget, Maharashtra’s spend on food security is Rs 145 per capita compared to Rs 705 in Tamil Nadu and 1,792 in Chhattisgarh.
