KURNOOL: YSRC party president   said the people of AP are angry and they are going to hurl stones at chief minister  . 

 Speaking at   show in Kurnool district on Friday, Jagan said the CM had done precious little for the people of the state and its farming community. He also took a dig at his former party members and the TDP for engineering defections and demanded that all turncoats face elections before joining other parties.
 
 "Naidu is more interested in kickbacks than the welfare of farmers. Three years are over and it is a matter of shame that the CM did not commission even a single irrigation project," he said.
 
 Referring to specific details, Jagan said, "Naidu has given Rs 100 crores for Veligonda project. It will not be sufficient for any viable purpose and if allocations are done in such a manner we do not know when this project will be completed."
 
 Presently, both Telangana and AP governments are under pressure from students and professors to effectively implement the fee reimbursement scheme. Jagan accused Naidu of putting the future of students into jeopardy by diluting the fee reimbursement scheme.
 
 He also said the present government had taken the life out his father YS  's Aarogyasri scheme which is supposed to provide financial protection to families living below poverty line. "YSR has built 42 lakh houses while Chandrababu Naidu did not build a single house, people should join hands to reject such leaders," Jagan demanded.
 
 This is the second day of YSRC's week-long   in Kurnool district. Later, Jagan also visited Mallikarjuna temple in Srisailam to offer prayers.
