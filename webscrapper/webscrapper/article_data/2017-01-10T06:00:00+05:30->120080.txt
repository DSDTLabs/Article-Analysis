KOLKATA: The probe by   so far has found little to indict the pilots of the three planes which were involved in the fracas that led to chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s flight from Patna   in the sky about a month ago.

 However, they have found certain “disparities” in the conversations between the pilots and ATC, a printed copy of which is in the possession of the investigators. This has led the cops to consider setting up a technical committee of experts who can direct them on the next course of action. There is a possibility the cops might send more questions to the   for further clarifications from their side.
 
 “These are technical details that goes beyond police knowledge. It is best to seek technical help. This is one step where we cannot go wrong,” said an investigating officer. The investigators feel that with the DGCA already giving a clean chit to the ATC, raising the bogey of “questionable doubts” on the role of any of its officers that day would need solid technical evidence, if at all. “We might seek the help of DGCA itself for this purpose,” an officer said.
 
 An AAI official expressed surprise over the cops’ inference that went contrary to the finding of DGCA, which had conducted an investigation. “We have been cooperating with the investigation carried out by Bidhannagar Police and awaiting their report. The cops are not looking into the technicality of the issue but whether there is criminality,” said AAI regional executive director Sanjay Jain.
