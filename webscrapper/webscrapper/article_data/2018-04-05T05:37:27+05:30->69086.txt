PANAJI: Congress on Wednesday said that the BJP-led coalition government was trying to silence the media and reduce transparency in government functioning. Referring to the fresh guidelines issued by the Goa legislature secretariat for media access,   secretary   said that the guidelines were unconstitutional and should be withdrawn.

 “The government’s intention is to silence the media,”   said. “It appears that the Manohar Parrikar government is scared of the bad news the media is bringing up, and this maybe a way to stop that.”
 
 The fresh guidelines for accreditation of media organizations and their representatives propose to restrict access to print and electronic media personnel covering the state assembly proceedings.
 
 “The speaker’s role is to protect the Constitution, but here I wonder if speaker   has even read the constitution,” Chodankar said. He said that the new guidelines were biased and favoured news organizations that are backed by large corporate houses. “The guidelines are casteist, elitist, and capitalist,” he said.
