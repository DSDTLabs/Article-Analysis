BAREILLY/ NEW DELHI: A day after the   told the Delhi high court that it is treating the disappearance of JNU student   Ahmed as a case of a "missing person" and has not found any evidence against nine suspects in the case, Najeeb's mother,   Nafees, on Saturday told TOI, "My son has not gone away somewhere. He has been abducted and kept somewhere." 

 "Najeeb was assaulted before his disappearance. If he had left on his own, he would have returned home. How can someone manage on his own without valid identity cards which is n eeded for basic things like travel? I do not have faith in police and CBI, but I have full confidence that I will get justice from the judiciary," she said. 
 
 Fatima (61), who returned to   on Friday night after the court hearing, said, "The court hearing was earlier slated for May 8, but it was postponed to Friday and I decided to stay in Delhi expecting good news. However, my heart sank on Friday and it was one of my worst journeys back home because all are trying to protect the suspects. The entire nation stands with me as everyone knows that Najeeb was assaulted at the campus of JNU. I came to know that Najeeb was assaulted four times before he was abducted."
 
 Commenting on the probe agency announcing a reward of Rs 10 lakh to anyone providing leads to Najeeb, Fatima said, "Even the crime branch had earlier announced an award and if it would have helped, I would have sold my property to declare an award. Only a thorough probe will help us."
