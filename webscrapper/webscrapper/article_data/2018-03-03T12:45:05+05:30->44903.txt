MUMBAI: An   class   was   of nearly Rs 3 lakh by an Ahmedabad man who posed as a   and showed interest in marrying him after seeing his profile on a matrimonial site in December 2017. MIDC police on Thursday said Vishal Jaiswani (25) used a software to make his voice sound like a woman to make   calls to the 32-year-old victim from MIDC, Andheri. 

 The victim transferred money to Jaiswani’s bank account as the accused claimed his mother was undergoing treatment for liver failure and was falling short of money to get a nurse in  .
 
 Jaiswani, a commerce graduate, was brought to Mumbai after police tracked him down to Sardar Nagar in Surat, Ahmedabad. He claimed he wanted to clear his brother’s Rs 14 lakh debt in the garment business. “The victim learnt that he was being duped when he told Jaiswani to provide his mother’s treatment details and corresponded with the hospital in Australia in January. The hospital replied that it did not have any female patient from India undergoing treatment for liver failure,” said a police officer.
 
 The victim liked Jaiswani’s female profile and proposed marriage on December 27, 2017. The victim said, “The fraudster claimed to be an MBA professional on a business tour to Australia. He had even sent selfies on WhatsApp. He requested Rs 14 lakh to pay hospital bills. I was convinced as he sent the current location of her whereabouts in Sydney on WhatsApp.”
 
 The victim approached cops on January 30 after learning that he was being duped. Deputy commissioner of police (zone X) Navinchandra Reddy supervised the team (senior inspector Shailesh Pasalwar, sub-inspector Swapnil Bhujbal and detection staff).
