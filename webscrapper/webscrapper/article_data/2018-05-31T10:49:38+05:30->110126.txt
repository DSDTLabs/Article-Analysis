PANAJI: To curb the transmission of   and   during the monsoon, the directorate of health services ( ) is asking all government departments to identify and do away with potential mosquito breeding sites in and around their premises.

 
 An advisory is being sent to all departments under the national vector-borne disease control programme, directing each to appoint a nodal person who should ensure no water is collected and allowed to stagnate in the vicinity of the respective offices. The move, which is aimed at tackling the breeding of mosquitos, stipulates a weekly survey of the premises and approaching the nearest health centre for help, if required.
 
 With the state looking to eliminate malaria by 2020, the DHS seeks the cooperation of citizens to strengthen its surveillance by ensuring that water collected in tanks, sumps and   don’t turn into breeding sites for mosquitoes. “Even a small quantity of water is enough to allow vector transmitting these diseases to breed,” says deputy director, national vector-borne disease control programme, Dr Anant Palekar. 
 
 The focus, Palekar says, is on source reduction and not on fogging, a practice that kills only adult mosquitoes. If potential breeding sites outside are not eliminated, it could result in a rise in mosquito population during dry spells after the rains.
 
 Health officer under the programme,  , says all vector-borne diseases in Goa are notifiable diseases. Health workers have been requesting laboratories and private clinics and hospitals to share details of patients who have contracted malaria and dengue, following which a mass survey of the area is carried out. 
 
 Guppy fish are also introduced in unused wells before the monsoon, free of cost.
