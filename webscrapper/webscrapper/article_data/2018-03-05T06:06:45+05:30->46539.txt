LUDHIANA:   police registered a case on Sunday against an NRI woman’s family, for allegedly duping a Ludhiana resident of Rs 5.50 lakh on the pretext of solemnising his marriage with the woman and sending him abroad. The family had asked for Rs 90,000 Australian dollars in three instalments, and they were paid Rs 5.50 lakh in the first instalment by the man’s family. However, after getting the money, the woman’s family ended all connection with the prospective groom and his family.

 Following the complaint of the youth’s father —   from Manakwal, Ludhiana — the Sadar police have registered a case under Section 420 (cheating) of the IPC against   of Basti Sheikh, Ghah Mandi Chowk, who is the father of the NRI woman. Kulwinder stated Khatri had released an advertisement in the matrimonial columns of a vernacular daily that they were looking for a match for his daughter,  , who is settled in Australia.
 
 Kulwinder added that they approached the NRI’s family for the marriage of his son. The woman’s family had promised that after marriage, their daughter would take her husband to Australia, for which they demanded Rs 90,000 Australian dollars in three instalments, out of which they had given Rs 5.50 lakh to the NRI’s family in advance to initiate the proceedings. He alleged that after duping them of Rs 5.50 lakh, the accused stopped picking up their phone calls. He also alleged that neither had the accused returned their money nor solemnised his son’s marriage with their daughter.
 
 The investigating officer from Sadar police station, ASI Ravinder Kumar, said the deal between the family happened in 2014, but the family filed a complaint only two years later in 2016. A case was registered on Sunday after the investigation was completed.
