Visakhapatnam: TDP leaders, including party supremo Nara Chandrababu Naidu, favoured the Andhra University Engineering College ground as the venue for party’s Mahanadu as it is considered lucky. Chandrababu Naidu had concluded his Mee Kosam padayatra (march) before the elections on this ground, after walking 2,340 km across undivided AP. The TDP won the elections that year and Naidu became the chief minister of AP after a gap of 10 years. Naidu was initially hesitating from using an educational institution’s ground for political purpose. 

 “We have physically visited the five sites proposed for the venue. Dairy Farm land would create hurdles for commuters as the NH 16 stretch is always busy. Keeping this in mind, ministers and leaders opted for the AU ground,” Urban TDP president and Visakha South MLA Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar told TOI. TNN
