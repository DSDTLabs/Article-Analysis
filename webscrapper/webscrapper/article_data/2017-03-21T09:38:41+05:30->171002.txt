COIMBATORE: More than 6,000 men from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala,  , Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka and union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa,   and Diu, Lakshadweep and Puducherry arrived in Coimbatore on Sunday night to attend the recruitment drive for the 110 Infantry Battalion TA (Madras) held here on Monday.

 Hundreds of   aspirants were seen sleeping along the Avinashi Road on Sunday night. With lack of facilities around PRS grounds, they had to walk till the railway station even to buy water and food, they said.
 
 A candidate said that in other locations, the recrutment venue is located close to the railway station or bus stops. "It is easier for us. However here, we have to travel nearly 3km even to get water. There are no toilet facilities as well," one of the candidates said.
 
 They have to pass the physical test, which includes pull-ups and running. Those who pass the test can take part in the medical tests and personal interview that will be conducted till March 24.
 
 For many of them, it was not the first attempt as they had already appeared for similar tests. "This is my fifth time. Only the written test is difficult to pass. But since this battalion's test involves only physical and medical tests, we are hopeful of clearing this," another candidate said.
 
 Meanwhile, Army officials said that there are 26 vacancies for the post of soldier (general duty).
