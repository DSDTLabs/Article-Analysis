BT was the first to tell you about telly couple   and   planning to tie the knot in June, this year. Well, we have now confirmed their   date. The duo, who has been in a relationship for the past four years, will exchange vows on June 21 in  . 

 The bride-to-be reveals, “We have chosen Shimla for various reasons. To begin with, most of our relatives are settled there. However, the pre-wedding functions will take place in Mumbai and Ludhiana (Abhinav’s hometown). We are not going in for an elaborate ritual, as for us, what matters most is the saat phere. We both wanted it to be an outdoor affair. Abhinav, being an adventure junkie, wished to exchange vows amidst the mountains, in the lap of nature. I, too, wanted a day wedding with lots of natural light and greenery around.” 
 
 Ask Rubina if she is having any pre-wedding jitters and she replies, “I am not someone who will have jitters. The idea is to grow old together and know each other better, gradually. I am looking forward to exploring new things with him by my side. I believe that one shouldn’t know everything about his/her partner at one go. Slow discovery of each other lends newness to the relationship and keeps the spark alive.” 
 
 The actress, who plays the protagonist in 'Saumya in Shakti —  ', is working on her leave for the wedding. She says, “I don’t think I will get a break for more than 10 days, as I have to balance my work and personal life. I can’t let my work suffer.”
 
 And what about their honeymoon? “Well, that can happen later. I don’t mind waiting for it, as anticipation adds to the excitement,” she signs off.
