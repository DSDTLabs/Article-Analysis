LUDHIANA: United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association ( ) on Saturday organised a meeting of its members after the   denied permission to industrialists for organising a   at Government Girls College citing the reason that electronic voting machines (EVM) are stored there. The decision had left the businessmen in a fix as they had already sent out invites to their dealers and other visitors mentioning the old venue. Moreover, several of them had already got the publicity material printed with the same name of venue.

 Speaking to TOI over the issue, president of UCPMA Charanjit Singh Vishvakarma said, "The three-day cycle expo was scheduled to begin from March 3 and we had fixed the venue to be Government Girls College as we have been organising this event here only on yearly basis. Though denial of permission for the venue is really a setback for us, we can understand the reasons for the same.” Vishivkarma also said, “Though some members of ours have suggested that we organise the expo at GLADA ground on Chandigarh Road, as of now there has been no general consensus on this. Therefore, the final decision in regards to change of venue will be taken by us on Monday”
 
 Others present in the meeting included general secretary of association Rajeev Jain, industrialist Avtar Singh Bhogal, senior vice-president Inderjit Singh Navyug, vice-president Harjeet Singh Sondh, joint secretary Satnam Singh Makkar, Propoganda secretary Rajinder Singh Sarhali, Surinder Singh Barar, Surinder Singh Mapco, Gurcharan Singh Mankoo, Beant Pal Singh, Tejwinder Singh and Satinderjit Singh Autom.
