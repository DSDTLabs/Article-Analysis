PUNE: Kerala Blasters’   gave the large number of travelling supporters exactly what they had come for with a stunning injury-time winner against   in a 2-1 win at the Balewadi stadium here on Friday.

 
 Jackichand Singh had given the visitors the lead in the second half but Emiliano Alfaro’s penalty had restored parity. Vineeth then pulled a rabbit out of the hat as his left-footed strike from 25 yards flew past Vishal Kaith in the Pune goal.
 
 The Stallions stay in third place with 22 points from 13 games while Kerala move up to 5th place with 20 points from 14 games.
 
 In the 5th minute, Pune goalkeeper Kaith, who drew praise from Kerala manager   before the game, almost gifted the visitors an early lead after making a hash of a routine clearance. The ball fell to   who tried to pick out a teammate when he should have gone for a goal and the chance went begging.
 
 Two minutes later, Diego Carlos cut in from the left and tried to catch out Subhasish Roy at his near post, but, the keeper was equal to the task. After a scrappy period, the next chance fell to the Blasters on the half-hour mark. Right-back Lalruatthara whipped in a lovely ball but Hume’s header looped over the bar. Four minutes before half-time, Alfaro was sent through with a ball by Rafa Lopez but the Uruguayan blazed his shot over the bar.
 
 A minute later, Hume was at it again when he went for a 50-50 ball against Kaith from Jackichand’s low cross but hurt himself in the process and had to be substituted.
 
 A rash challenge on the touchline on one of his players just before the break irked Pune coach Ranko Popovic and he was sent to the stands for complaining about it to the referee.
