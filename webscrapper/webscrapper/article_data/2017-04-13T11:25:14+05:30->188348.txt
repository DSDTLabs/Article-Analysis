BENGALURU: Amidst the sea of red and black - the   Bangalore colours - it isn't hard to spot  . After all, the 22-year-old stands tall at 6ft8". Stanlake, who started off as an   player, turned his focus to cricket after being picked in the Australian U-19 team at the age of 16.

 Picked for his maiden   season to beef up the RCB pace attack, the Australian import got his chance early, playing his part effectively in the home team's win against   last week. A call-up in the second game of the season came as a surprise even to the youngster.
 
 "I didn't expect to play so soon, to get an early game in has been a surprise. To play in front of the home fans last Friday night was a great experience, to see how loud they get here was incredible," said Stanlake, who made his international debut earlier this year.
 
 In the two games that he has played thus far, Stanlake has impressed with his pace, variation and length.
 
 Playing for the first time at M Chinnaswamy stadium, a park which is not particularly kind to bowlers, Stanlake said, he has had no problems adapting to the conditions in quick time.
 
 "It (bowling) doesn't change too much. I keep it fairly simple. I try and bowl fast and aggressive and take wickets. The last two games I've played, I've had nice bounce and carry so I haven't had to change much. I think I've been lucky here."
