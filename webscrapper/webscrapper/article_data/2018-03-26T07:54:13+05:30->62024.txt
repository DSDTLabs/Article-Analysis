CHENNAI: It is not just   aggregators who use surge pricing. In an attempt to boost revenue, government buses in Tamil Nadu have started adopting a similar strategy, forcing passengers to pay one-and-a-half times the normal fare on board ‘special’ buses operated during weekends.

 A visit by TOI to the Chennai Mofussil Bus terminus in Koyambedu showed many government buses, which are supposed to be operated with ‘ordinary’ fares, being run as ‘special’ services. Most of these buses are bound for places like Thanjavur, Kumbakonam, Madurai and places in other southern districts, besides popular tourist destinations. Never have such provisions existed in the rule book until government orders were issued in January revising the bus fare structure. 
 
 The state government seems to have silently brought in this provision, aimed at allowing state-owned transport corporations to boost their crumbling revenue. And the effect is telling daily footfall in government buses had come down from 1.82 crore in 2017 to nearly 1.60 crore in March.
 
 Consumer rights activists are fuming. “Though the government order states that only special buses operated during weekends and festivals are allowed to collect one and a half times the normal fare, even ordinary buses have started using this opportunity to collect fares at an increased rate,” said K Kathirmathiyon, an activist who has filed a complaint with the state government in this connection .
 
 Besides, the government has decided to round off the ticket value to the   while calculating it based on the number of stages travelled by the passenger. Prior to the fare revision, fraction of less than 50 paise were ignored in the calculation.
 
 Now, the calculations have changed. For example, for a ticket valued at 5.01, 6 would be charged from the passenger.
