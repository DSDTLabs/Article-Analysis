HYDERABAD: Trapped in Basra in  , 20 workers from   are pleading to be rescued. The General Administration (NRI) department of the Telangana government has written to the Embassy of India in Baghdad and the secretary at the external affairs ministry to rescue them. 

 In a video message sent to social worker Patkuri Basanth Reddy, the workers said they have been cheated by an illegal job agent in Telangana, who collected 1.5 lakh from each worker. On landing in Basra, the travails of the workers started as they were allegedly made to work for 12 hours at a stretch and sometimes day and night. They said they were being provided stale food and were being exploited. "When we said we want to leave, the employer asked us to pay 2,600 dollars each," workers Enakasu Thirupathi and P Srinivas said in the video, pleading to be rescued. Acting promptly on the issue, General Administration (NRI) department on Saturday provided a list of 20 names including the passport numbers to the Embassy of India in Baghdad to rescue them. In the letter, it was pointed out that the agent who sent them to Iraq had cheated them and handed them over to a different company, instead of the one in which they were promised employment. 
 
 The letter said the employer has also taken away their passports and the workers have to stay in a small room. They are unable to come out as they would be put in jail if caught by the police as they don't have their passports. "The families are worried. Please repatriate them from Iraq to India," the letter said. The immigrants hail from Rajanna Sircilla, Jagtial, Nirmal, Mancherial and Nizamabad.
