 Shimla City generates 55 to 60 metric tons (MT) of municipal solid waste every day, and because of dispute between the   and previous project proponent, the plant could not operate and there was huge dumping of waste on the site from Shimla and other surrounding areas of the plant; and then after terminating the contract of the previous Project Proponent the   had issued fresh tender and now tender and work has been awarded to Elephant Energy Private Limited.
 
 Presently under the orders of the Tribunal, Shimla Municipal Corporation is sending its waste to energy plant at Chandigarh and is paying certain amount of tipping fee.
 
 Sources said that plant has a capacity to use 100 MT of waste to generate electricity which means entire waste generated in the town would be consumed for generation of 1.7 MW to 2 MW power. Company executing the project would run the plant for 40 years. So far Rs 42 crores have been spent on the plant.
