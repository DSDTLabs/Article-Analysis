BHUBANESWAR: Speaker   on Thursday gave his nod for a debate on   in the assembly after the opposition, Congress and BJP, created ruckus over the issue. 

 The opposition sought suspension of the question hour demanding discussion on a motion on incidents of poll-related violence soon after the house met for the day. The speaker did not allow. The members created pandemonium after that, forcing him to adjourn the house for more than an hour. 
 
 Raising the issue when the house reconvened, members of all three major political parties blamed each other for the violence.
 
 Leader of opposition   said money had played a great role in the poll and was root cause of violence. He said the rising incidents of murder and violence are unprecedented in state politics. 
 
 Opposition whip   (Congress) accused the BJP of importing goons from Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand and the BJD of using the local ones. If this trend continues, Odisha will go Bihar way, he said.
 
 Arguing for a debate on violence during the poll, BJP legislature party leader   apprehended that there may be more violence during official publication of results on Saturday. "If the house holds a debate, it will send a strong signal to the wrong-doers and check such incidents," he said.
