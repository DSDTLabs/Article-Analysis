The   government has given a push to the proposed   and Bundelkhand expressways by allocating Rs 1,000 crore and Rs 650 crore respectively. Over 345-km Purvanchal Expressway, inarguably the country’s longest, will connect Lucknow with Ghazipur, while the Bundelkhand Expressway will provide fast road connectivity between   and Allahabad.

 The state government has also made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the 304km Lucknow-Agra Expressway. Significantly, the budgetary allocation for the project comes almost a month after the state government imposed toll tax on the expressway.
 
 Soon after coming to power last year, the BJP did not make budgetary provision for expressways. Instead, it initiated inquiries into projects which were initiated during the Akhilesh Yadav regime.
 
 Importantly, a budgetary provision of Rs 550 crore has also been made to link  , the home turf of chief minister  , with the Purvanchal Expressway. The UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority has already announced to finalise bids for the expressway’s construction by March.
 
 Official sources said that construction of expressways is being conceived with the idea to boost the state economy through faster movement of goods, including farm produce.
