Taking his relationship with   to the next level in the virtual world, TV actor   recently changed his name to Prince Yuvika Narula on social media. Interestingly,   was in the news after he added his actress-wife Sonam’s initials to his own soon after their wedding earlier this month, However, Prince says that he didn’t follow in anyone’s footsteps. 

 He says, “I changed my handle in March; it’s just that people noticed it only recently. Why should only women change their names after marriage? I am the other half in this relationship. Also, I fell in love with her first and so, I should contribute equally if not more. I didn’t add her name to mine for publicity. In fact, I got her name inked on the back of my neck in February. If I were seeking publicity out of it, I would have done it on Valentine’s Day.”
 
 The actor says that the name change is permanent, as the relationship is for keeps. “Who doesn’t fight in a relationship? We do fight, but then our love is too strong to let anything weaken it. Yuvika also wanted to change her name on social media, but I told her to do it after marriage. I did it because it was my way of professing my love for her,” he signs off. The couple, who got engaged in January, plans to tie the knot in October or November this year.
