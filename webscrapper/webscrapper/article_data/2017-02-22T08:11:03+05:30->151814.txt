PUNE: The   has decided to secure its three open plots by constructing walls around them. Over the past few years, these pieces of land have been prone to encroachments. 

 The three plots include the one near Poona College; the plot adjacent to Ambedkar School, near  , which is being used to dump garbage; and the one near Ayyappa temple in Ghorpadi, where local residents park their vehicles and carts. 
 
 The issue of encroachments on defence land came up in January during a discussion on the land near   around which a compound wall is being built. The open space was being used by hawkers to sell food items and park vehicles.
 
 “Several members have been complaining about the vacant plots being encroached upon at a number of places, apart from the one near Poona College. Therefore, we decided to secure them and prevent encroachments from taking place there. The board has now decided to construct walls or erect barbed wire fences around the plots. Our CEO said at the meeting that since these plots are national property, any encroachment is unacceptable,” a senior PCB official said. The local defence estates office has already written to the board asking it to secure the plots, which has ‘expedited’ the process, the official added. 
 
 Officials said trees will be planted on the open plots. “The cantonment areas are known for being greener than the rest of the city. We will make these plots natural hubs by carrying out afforestation over time. Encroachments will be difficult in future and it will be a step towards welfare of locals as well,” the official added.
