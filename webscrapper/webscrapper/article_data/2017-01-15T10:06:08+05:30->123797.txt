 "It is a sad reality that visually-challenged women face difficulties in finding a life partner despite being well off with highly-paid jobs," said Sajeevan C, KFB state secretary. There has been no change in the notion that women were married off only to do household chores and take care of the family, he added.
 
 Besides looking into alliances and bearing wedding expenses, the federation will also impart special training programmes to make the women self-sufficient and well-equipped to manage household works. The organization also plans to provide solutions and guidance for self-employment. Around 100 women will be given jobs while 30 of them will get new houses constructed using KFB funds.
 
 The federation also launched an audio magazine named Dhyuthi, which includes section on literature, current affairs and politics.
 
 "When the federation was launched back in 1967, the situation was deplorable. The world of a visually challenged was confined to a room. Our efforts have changed the condition to a great extent. Now, our members have proved themselves in various fields," said Sanjeevan.
