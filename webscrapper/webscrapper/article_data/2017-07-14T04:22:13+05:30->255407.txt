SRINAGAR: In a first, the corpse of a terrorist was wrapped in the flag of the Islamic State terror group as hundreds of supporters joined his funeral in Srinagar on Wednesday. They waved flags with pictures of slain   commander   and his protege   alias Musa. 

 This was a departure from previous instances when the bodies of slain terrorists used to be covered with Pakistani flags.  , a resident of downtown Srinagar, was killed along with two other Hizbul terrorists in an encounter on Wednesday. Police said Gilkar had played a key role in the lynching of DSP Mohammad Ayub Pandith. Gikar’s funeral prayers were held in the premises of Jamia Masjid where Pandith was lynched by a mob on June 22. 
 
 Though police named Gilkar for Pandith’s lynching, the SIT is yet to submit its report. Police said Gilkar went underground after June 22 and joined Hizbul. Gilkar was also involved in the grenade attacks on CRPF at Nowhatta on April 2, 2017, CRPF camp Safa Kadal on June 11, 2017 and on a police party at Khanyar on April 30, 2017. 
 
 Hundreds of people defied curfew and gathered at Nowhatta for Gilkar’s funeral. Many women mourners sang eulogies: “Qoam ay Bahaduro, Karyo goor gooro (Bravehearts of the nation, let me sing you a lullaby).”
