CHENNAI: Unrest seems to be brewing at  . On Saturday, senior engineers wore black badges at a review meeting at   against the elevation of N   from executive engineer in Alandur to chief engineer of the buildings department on February 3. The previous incumbent,  , was demoted to superintending engineer (SE). 

 As many as 50 of the 70 participants at the meeting were SEs, zonal officers and executive engineers (EEs) from various departments who say due processes weren't followed in Mahesan's promotion.
 
 When the expanded areas were merged with the city corporation in 2011, Mahesan, who was with the erstwhile Alandur municipality, chose to continue with the corporation as assistant executive engineer. The protesters, who have been with the corporation since the early 1990s, alleged that he was elevated in the next two years to become EE when rules mandate that those joining corporation from other municipalities figure last on the seniority list.
 
  Since then, they said, different petitions were filed in court against the appointment and a stay received in two cases. The cases were later clubbed and in November 2016, a court dismissed it saying Mahesan's appointment was valid. The engineers have again appealed and said they didn't want to go on a mass strike as the appeal is coming up for hearing next week. 
 
 Legally, nothing stops Mahesan's continuation in the post but the protesting engineers say they are determined to prove norms were flouted. 
 
 "How can someone who has worked in the corporation only for six years and who hasn't been an SE for a single day be given a double promotion?" said an executive engineer who joined the corporation in 1993. The minimum qualifying service is five years for an EE and two for an SE and they will be promoted based on vacancy. 
 
 When contacted, Mahesan told TOI that he had over 32 years of experience. "I'm only following orders given by the court and the government," said Mahesan. "Everything is transparent."
