  : Amid the growing need for   in critical areas to create new solutions that can have a lasting impact on  , a group of CSIR-NML scientists in collaboration with  's industrial group have developed a material for supercapacitor. 

 Based on the e-poster which CSR-NML's biomaterials group uploaded on collagen-graphene composites (chemical properties) for 'Materials Today' in 2013, Sri Lanka's John Kell's Research (JKR) team headed by Muditha Senarath Yappa expressed his interest in exploiting the above composites for energy applications.
 
 Under a project sponsored by  , the team consisting of project leader Suprabha Nayar and researchers Soumya Bhattacharyaa and Divya Kumari studied these composites in great depth and explored its feasibility as a supercapacitor.
