HYDERABAD: The   model of fasting does not have any adverse impact on the body. But in turn it benefits fasting individuals both biochemically and physiologically. The Ramzan model of fasting is medically known as “intermittent fasting“, which is quite different from other types of fasting. According to senior physician Dr   Mohammad, intermittent fasting involves about 14 hours of abstinence from food and water and 10 hours of non-fasting period. This is repeated daily for a month. Other types of fasting involve either total abstinence from food and water for a specific number of days, or drinking water and eating fruits. But on the other hand, the Ramzan model of fasting is intermittent in the sense that there is an alternation of fasting and non-fasting period within a 24-hour day .

A research study published in the recent issue of the journal,  , revealed that intermittent fasting did not result in any adverse effect on the “body composition, glucose metabolism and cognitive function."
