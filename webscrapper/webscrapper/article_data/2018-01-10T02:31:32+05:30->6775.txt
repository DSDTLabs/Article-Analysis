GHAZIABAD: Five persons, including a jeweller were arrested on Monday for their alleged involvement in burglaries in homes across NCR.

 Police recovered household and electronic items such as LED TV, music system and laptops, jewellery, country-made pistol and knives amounting to Rs15 lakh.
 
 According to the police, the accused have confessed to their involvement in two thefts in Vasundhara, and one each in Vaishali, Prahlad Garhi and Abhay Khand in  .
 
  The accused are Ravi Ranjan, Aslam, Sumit, Santosh and Devendra Rastogi, a jeweller and a resident of Sector 63 in Noida. They were arrested from Kanawani village after police received a tip-off on Monday.
 
 SP (City)   said, “The accused have a criminal background and have been to jail in the past. Their modus operandi was to roam around in various localities as utility service providers and gather information about locked homes. Later, they would commit burglaries after breaking the locks. They also took the CCTV cameras and devices used to record video footage so that police cannot trace them.”
 
 “They put a lot of effort in deciding their target. Before breaking into any house, they would look into the house after breaking a window pane to find out what items are kept inside,” said CO (Indirapuram) R K Mishra.
 
 The accused admitted that they had sold stolen ornaments in the past four-five months to Rastogi. We are sure that all the five are involved in more cases,” said Mishra.
