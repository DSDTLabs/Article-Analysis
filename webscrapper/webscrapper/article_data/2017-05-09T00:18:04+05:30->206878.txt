Mumbai: Road   in the city continued to move at a snail’s space even as the Thane   told   officials on Monday to give a written justification on why they needed few quarries in his district to be restarted.

 Work in the city had taken a major hit after the closure of stone quarries in Thane district since April 1, as they do not have   permission to operate. Raw material, like granular sub-base and wet mix macadam, are sourced from the quarries.
 
 The BMC chief engineer of roads met the collector and explained how road repairs had taken a major hit after the quarries were shut. A senior civic official said the collector sought a written justification. “This, however, is another day’s delay for road repairs in Mumbai to gain speed,” said the official. BMC has been rushing against time to complete repairs before the month-end.
 
 Municipal commissioner Ajoy Mehta had taken stock of monsoon preparedness work across Mumbai on Saturday. Mehta said the roads department should try to call for material from places other than Thane.
 
 The department had undertaken repairs of 1,004 roads after withdrawal of the monsoon last year. Of these, 583 road works were started in the first phase and the civic authorities were hoping to complete repairs of 369 prior to the monsoon. 
 
 A civic official said apart from project roads, there were road works which were also taken on priority, from where there are repeated complaints every monsoon. Earlier this year, officials of all wards were told to submit a list of roads in their wards that needed to be repaired on priority. Of these, 110 road resurfacing works have been completed, while there are 938 road resurfacing works of the priority two list, which were taken up for repairs, of which there are instructions to complete at least 50%. 
 
 The deadline for road repairs was set as May 15 but it’s most likely to get delayed.
