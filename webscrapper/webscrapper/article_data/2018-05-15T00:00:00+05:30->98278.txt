:  

 : My mother is quintessentially everything for us (his sister   and him). She handles my dates, events, finances and all other important aspects on the professional front. In a sense, we are like the agency, where I am the 
 creative and she heads everything else. What amazes me is how she does this while managing the household simultaneously. There are times when she is discussing dates and logistics, while cooking in the kitchen. She is also my go-to person for all things at home, be it plumbing, my car or any other detail. I hope to be half as good a parent as her to my children. 
 
 I credit my mother’s genes somewhere to my funny bone, because I feel that we’ve got it from her. She’s also my hero in the literal sense of the word. In the beginning, when I used to do events at mall as an emcee, she would be there listening to me, when no one else bothered, and would then give me inputs and pep me up. Those are the little things that have helped me grow to become the person I am today.
