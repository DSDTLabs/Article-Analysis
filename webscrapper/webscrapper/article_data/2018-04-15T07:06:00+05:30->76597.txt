 “Around 10.30am on Thursday, I saw the girl crying and brought her to my shop. I realised she had a problem in one of her eyes. When I asked what had happened, she told me she had been raped four days ago and her landlord had forced her out. She had nowhere to go,” said Subash, the tea-seller.
 
 Subash said the girl had told him her father died around a month ago. 
 
 “She gave me a phone number of a relative. I called up, but he disconnected the call. Since then, the phone has been switched off. I informed police. The CWC members took her away,” he said.
 
 CWC member Shalini Singh said the girl was too traumatised to give details of what had happened to her. “She told police she was gagged and raped by an unidentified youth between Monday night and Tuesday morning. Her landlord, too, has thrown her out of the  ,” Singh said.
 
 Rajesh Mishra, the circle officer of Sahibabad police station, said: “The girl is in the custody of CWC and she is being counselled. Once we get the final report from CWC, we will proceed with the case. We are in touch with the CWC members, who told us that the girl has been making conflicting statements. We are yet to register a case.”
