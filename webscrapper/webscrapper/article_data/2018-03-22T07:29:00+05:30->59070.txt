Chandigarh: The Punjab council of ministers on Wednesday approved policy guidelines to facilitate laying of gas pipelines across the state. The policy has been drafted after examining Gujaratâ€™s policy as suggested by the petroleum and natural gas regulatory board (PNGRB).

 As per the policy, an annual rent of Rs 50 per running meter has been prescribed. For granting permissions, a single-window mechanism at the district level would be notified by the local government department.
 
 The PNGRB grants authorization of laying, building, operating or expanding the city gas distribution network (CGDN). Till date, the PNGRB has authorized five companies in the state to lay gas pipelines in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ropar, Mohali and Bathinda districts. But in the absence of any uniform policy governing grant of permission or levy of compensation/restoration/rehabilitation charges for right of use of way of land belonging to the state government departments for laying of gas pipelines, various departments are dealing with their application in different ways. Hence the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed the state government to frame a uniform policy in this regard.
 
 The cabinet decision will now facilitate laying of gas pipelines, under the CGDN, by licensed entities/firms/companies which have been awarded the work.
