MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government and   of rationalist Govind   moved the Bombay high court to challenge the   granted by a sessions court in Kolhapur to main accused, Sameer Gaikwad, for the   of the veteran CPI leader. Pansare was shot on February 16, 2015, in Kolhapur. He died on February 20.

 Special public prosecutor Harshad Nimbalkar, who filed the application for the state, pointed out that the Bombay HC had earlier rejected Gaikwadâ€™s bail plea on merits, holding that there was a prima facie case against him, yet despite there being no change in circumstance, the Kolhapur sessions court had on June 17 granted bail of Rs 25,000. .
 
 A bench of Justice Revati Mohite Dere issued a notice to the accused and posted the matter for hearing after three weeks.
 
 Gaikwad was arrested in September 2015 in the case after the state set up a special investigation team. The challenge to bail is on the grounds that the sessions court also failed to appreciate that he and some conspirators and shooters may be involved in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case.
 
 Avocate Sanjeev Punalekar, who appeared for Gaikwad, had earlier said there was nothing on record to show any link between the murders.
