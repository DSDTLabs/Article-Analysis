The accused also allegedly proposed to the woman and beat her up when she refused his advances. The victim managed to escape with her son and got home. After day break, the victim and her husband lodged a complaint at Sonarpur police station naming Naskar as the accused. 
 
 “Police arrested Naskar within an hour of receiving the complaint,” said Baruipur SP Arijit Sinha. On the counter-complaint lodged by Naskar’s wife, Sinha said, “We are investigating the counter-complaint, but will take action only after we are convinced it is genuine.”
