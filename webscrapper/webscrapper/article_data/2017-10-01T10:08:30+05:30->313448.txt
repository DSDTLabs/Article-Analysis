MOHALI: The municipal corporation (MC) has handed over the operations of a   to a new contractor.

 “We have terminated the contract of previous contractor as many anomalies were detected in his working. The contract termination letter was earlier sent for approval to director local bodies. We have issued a new contract to an   managing the Chandigarh-based gaushala in Sector 45,” said MC commissioner Sandeep Hans.
 
 Hans said the MC had been receiving complaints about irregularities and sick   on a daily basis owing to the former contractor’s negligence. He said the MC had sent a notice to the contractor in April, which he refused to accept.
 
 TOI had earlier highlighted the wrongdoings of the contractor of misutilising the fodder donated by the public. The cattle pound housed around 760 stray cattle, for which each cattle consumed 40 kg of fodder. According to the MC records, the contractor had been charging Rs 27 per cattle per day for fodder, which computes to Rs 18,000 to Rs 20,000 per day, meaning that around Rs 5 lakh per month was being drawn by the contractor.
 
 Sources said as per the complaints the contractor has been feeding only 15 to 20 kg of fodder to stray cattle.
 
 Sources said the doctor employed by the contractor was also not qualified. The complainants also alleged the contractor has been earning money by selling milch cattle to outsiders without taking the consent of the MC.
