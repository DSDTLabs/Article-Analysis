NEW DELHI: Cracking down on Kashmiri separatists accused of receiving illegal  , the   has issued summons to   leader   and JKLF chief  .

 While Malik has been asked to appear for questioning on March 28, Geelani has been summoned on April 3 to record his statement in a case against him under the Foreign Exchange Management Act. 
 
 Both the accused will be interrogated at the EDâ€™s Srinagar office.
 
 The agency had registered a case against Geelani based on an income tax recovery in 2002 of $10,000 from his residence in Hyderpora, Srinagar. Geelani had failed to explain the source of this money. 
 
 A tax penalty case was slapped against him later but he never responded to those I-T notices.
 
 Successive governments at the Centre did not pursue the case against the separatist leader fearing violent reprisals in the Valley.
 
 Reviving its office in Srinagar, the ED recently deputed a senior officer from Delhi and filed several cases under   and the anti-money laundering law (PMLA).
 
 A FEMA case was also registered against JKLF chief Yasin Malik based on an FIR by the police which had in 2001 recovered $100,000 from a hawala dealer. 
 
 The hawala operator had told the police that the cash consignment had come from   operatives based in Nepal and was meant for Malik.
