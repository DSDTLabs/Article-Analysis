NEW DELHI:   stormed an   in   on Saturday night, held the employees hostage at gunpoint and made off with Rs 25 lakh in cash -all in two minutes. The men, wearing masks and brandishing guns and batons, fought off a security guard at the reception - he was hit with the butt of a pistol - before speeding away with the booty in a mini truck.

 A CCTV camera captured the robbers barging into the godown at 7.48pm and leaving at 7.50pm.
 
 Police suspect the role of ex-employees of the godown in the crime as the robbers knew where the cash box was kept. The cash collection of the day was counted and locked in the box for it to be deposited in bank on Monday , police said.
 
 The employees told cops that when they tried to resist the robbery , they were warned they would be shot if they made even the slightest of movements. One of the masked men quickly reached for the cash box, took out the entire amount, put it inside a bag and left.
 
 Police are examining call records of former and current staffers of the godown to ascertain whether they could have played a role in the crime.
