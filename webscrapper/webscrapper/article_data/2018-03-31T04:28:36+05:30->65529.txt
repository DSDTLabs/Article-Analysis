MUMBAI: Water started leaking from the roof of Mumbai's first   that runs between   and Churchgate on Friday. The snag was noticed in one of the compartments. 

 As water dripped in the compartment,   pasted a notice on the backrest of the soaked seats, cautioning people against using them. The AC rake was introduced on December 25 last year.
 
 Commuters recorded a video of the incident and posted it on social media. WR's chief public relations officer Ravinder Bhakar said, "The train is running fine except the water droplets that fell in the coach on Friday. But as there is only one AC rake in service, we decide to repair the drain pipe after it brought to the carshed. The issue has been resolved now."
 
 A senior WR official said, "The drain pipe design was slightly flawed. During excess cooling, the water, instead of going through the drain pipe, exited from the vent."
 
 Commuters have also complained that doors of the AC coaches stay open for more than a minute though no passenger is boarding or alighting. The railway guard has now been told that to not keep the doors open for more than 30 seconds.
 
 Some commuters had complained that excess halts had affected the rake's punctuality. However, WR said there has not been much impact on the punctuality as the train halts at limited stops between Virar and Borivli and at none between   and Churcghate.
