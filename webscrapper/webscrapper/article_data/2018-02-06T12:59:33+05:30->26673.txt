Mumbai: The   and US private equity major   on Monday called off a transaction involving the conglomerate’s sale of a 43% stake in   (Tata Tech). The scrapping of Warburg’s $360-million investment in   comes eight months after Tata Group and Warburg announced the deal.

 The transaction was called off due to non-receipt of regulatory approvals and Tata Tech missing performance goals. Warburg was to acquire the 43% stake in the Singapore-headquartered auto-design company from Tata Motors (30%) and Tata Capital (13%). 
 
 In a regulatory filing, Tata Motors said that it will continue to explore strategic options to sell its stake in Tata Tech and remains positive on the outlook of the business. Tata Tech generated a profit of $53 million on a turnover of $423 million in FY2017.
