KOLKATA:   on Tuesday formed an inquiry committee to investigate the blackening of Syama Prasad Mookerjee’s name on the Roll of Honour at the Hall of Fame on the varsity campus.

 The panel comprises the dean of science, dean of arts, dean of students, controller of examination and professor Gandhi Kar of the political science department.
 
 “We have asked the committee to submit its findings at the earliest. The team will share their findings with the police,” said registrar Debajyoti Konar.
 
 The committee has started collecting images from two CCTV cameras installed at the two ends of the corridor, which itself is not covered by cameras. The members may also speak to students. “Some guards, who were present on the weekend, have been questioned. The panel will talk to others as well,” a university source said.
 
  chairman Sugata Bose, who visited the campus to attend the governing board meeting, denounced the act and said the authorities should find out the culprits and act against them at the earliest.
 
 The police, which have also started an investigation, scanned the entry register of the institute.
 
 Members of ABVP had planned to stage a protest against the blackening at the university but they took the demonstration to the Gandhi statue at Maidan.
