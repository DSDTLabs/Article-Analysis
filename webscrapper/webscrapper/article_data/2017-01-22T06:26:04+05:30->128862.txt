LUCKNOW: SP patriarch  's close associate and former UP minister Ambika   joined BSP in the presence of party chief   amid high drama on Saturday . Chaudhary was first sacked as cabinet minister and then denied a ticket by UP CM Akhilesh Yadav after a feud broke out in the party's first family.
Chaudhary walked into the state BSP headquarters here unannounced at 11.30am even as Mayawati was half-an-hour into her press conference which she had called to speak on a host of political issues. Just before Chaudhary's entry , Mayawati flipped a piece of paper on her table and nodded at close aide and   MP Satish Chandra  .
 
 After a few minutes, even as Mayawati was answering queries from reporters, Chaudhary walked in with a bouquet. He greeted Mayawati and sat next to her. Though dramatic, his entry looked orchestrated.
 
 No BSP leader has ever sat next to Mayawati at press conferences or rallies. Once Chaudhary took his seat, Mishra rushed to the dais and sat on her other side.
 
 After Chaudhary spoke on why he quit SP and joined BSP, Mayawati declared him the party's candidate from Phephna, replacing Abiram Singh, whose candidature was announced recently .
 
 She told reporters that if approached, she would even consider taking Mulayam's brother Shivpal in her party.“If he comes with a request, I will think about it,“ she said while answering a query.
 
 Mayawati said the SP family feud was orchestrated by Mulayam out of “putra moh“ (love for his son). “Mulayam even sidelined his brother Shivpal for his son.Shivpal has now been restricted to one constituency.“
 
 She appealed to Muslims and other communities “not to waste their votes“ by voting for SP. She slammed Congress for the ongoing alliance talks with SP.
 
 Chaudhary said he switched over to BSP to “stop communal forces“ from taking over UP after 2017 polls.“I've been a hardcore follower of Mulayam Singh Yadav. But his removal as party president did not go down well with the party ranks,“ he said.
