KARWAR/BENGALURU/ DELHI: In an embarrassment to  , its newly-elected Karnataka MLA Shivaram   on Monday dismissed as “fake” an audio clip which was released by his party two days ago to make allegations against BJP that it was trying to buy support of MLAs for B S Yeddyurappa who resigned just before the trust vote. 

 
 BJP was quick to seize the opportunity with its president Amit Shah accusing Congress of circulating “doctored” tapes. Congress MLC V S Ugrappa had released the audio tape on Saturday few hours before the scheduled trust vote claiming that it had the voices of Yedyurappa’s son Vijayendra and Hebbar’s wife  . 
 
 In the audio tape, Rs 15 crore and a ministerial berth for Hebbar is being offered in case the   abstained from voting. However, Hebbar contradicted Ugrappa’s claim in a Facebook post written in Kannada. He questioned the authenticity of the audio clip, saying: “The voice is not of my wife. She did not get a call.” 
 
 He added: “Whoever released such tape has my dhikkar (condemnation). The audio tape is fake. I condemn it. I thank my constituency people who have given me a chance again. I will work for them.” Lashing out at Congress over Hebbar’s statement, Shah said the BJP leaders accused in the fake tapes should take legal action against Congress. “The revelation made by the Congress MLA makes it clear as to how the misinformation campaign was carried out by Congress. 
 
 Unfortunately, media ran them without verifying. The entire fake campaign was to put pressure on  ,” Shah said. Congress had released three audio tapes in the run up to the floor test, claiming that BJP leaders were trying to ‘poach’ party MLAs by offering ‘blandishments’.
