Patiala: Bankers have decided to go on a nationwide strike on August 22 in protest against the recent step taken by the Union government to alert the functioning of the banking sector. 

 The general secretary of All India Bank Officers Confederation (AIBOC) D T Franco Rajender Dev said the steps taken by the government would cause dismantling of public sector units and have a huge impact on the banking industry. He said a number of legislative moves initiated in the Parliament was against the interest of the common man and thus the bankers had called for a strike on August 22.
 
 He said over one million bankers under the banner of the United Forum of Bank Unions would participate in the strike and would also analyse the much hyped Gyan Sangam conclave attended by the Prime Minister, the finance minister and all the executives of the banks, wherein, the government laid out a road map on several policies. Franco, who was in the city along with Com. Y Sudarshan, the general secretary of All India State Bank Officers Federation to attend a mammoth zonal meeting of the State Bank of India Officers’ Association after the merger of State Bank of Patiala with the State Bank of India, said the bankers would discuss the insolvency and bankruptcy code, the Financial Resolution and Deposit Insurance Bill, the Industrial Relations Bill amendments to Banking Regulation Act.
 
 He said when the banks’ non-performing asset had crossed Rs 7 lakh crore mark, the government had not taken any proactive stand to give more powers to the banks to recover their money. He said the bankers were also concerned about the growing unemployment, farmers' suicide and lay off in IT sector, which were signs of a weakening economy due to wrong policies.
