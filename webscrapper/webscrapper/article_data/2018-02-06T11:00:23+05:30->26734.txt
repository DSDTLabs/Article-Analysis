MUMBAI: After drawing flak from students and faculties,  , on Monday, withdrew the ban on sale of non-veg food at Civil Café – the most popular cafeteria on the campus.

 In a statement, IIT-B said, “There is no restriction on the sale of non-veg items and the letter to the caterer of the café (‘imposing’ the ban) was in the context of serving stale food and to ensure that no cooking is allowed in the academic area. The pre-emptive action was in the interest of health and safety of the users.” It added, “The institute does not favour any one preference or discriminate on such grounds.”
 
 Civil Café, the only rooftop café on the campus, is popular for its non-veg items. “Since the ban has been lifted, they are likely to serve non-veg food from Tuesday,” said a student.
 
 In a January 20 notice, the canteen committee of the   issued a diktat to the contractor asking them to not serve non-veg items. TOI has a copy of the notice. The committee also asked the caterer to stop cooking on the terrace to prevent any fire hazard. “Since cooking on the terrace is not allowed, we did not want students to consume stale food. Non-veg food gets spoilt faster and therefore, we wanted to avoid it,” said the institute’s spokesperson.
 
 A student said there was no logic in banning only non-veg items as even veg food can get stale. “The department could not have introduced such a policy without consulting stakeholders. Over 90% of the people prefer eating non-veg food at the cafe,” said a student. Incidentally, Civil is also one of the largest cafeterias in the academic area. The café has become a party hub of sorts for students beyond academic hours too, prompting authorities to restrict the cafeteria timings.
