KOCHI: The Supreme Court is considering enhancing the compensation for former   scientist  , who was framed in the 1994 espionage case, to Rs75 lakh. A bench comprising Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices D Y Chandrachud and A M   is looking into   for malicious prosecution and tarnishing of reputation. 

 Narayanan had moved the apex court seeking criminal proceedings against police officers involved in the investigation and prosecution. The court said it could not recommend criminal action against officers as there was no such recommendation in the 1998 court judgment that upheld the CBI's finding that the espionage allegation is wrong.
 
 However, the court can direct compensation to be paid by those involved in the investigation and the state government can be asked to recover the compensation from their properties, it said. The compensation shall be determined in accordance with the status of the petitioner, it added. In 2001, the   had ordered a compensation of Rs10 lakh to be paid to Narayanan.
