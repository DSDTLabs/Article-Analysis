 The 27-year-old woman, a housewife living in Old Gurugram, visited the hospital around 11am on Thursday. The woman, who was five months pregnant, was visiting the hospital for the first time for a medical check-up as she had been suffering from some discomfort and other complications. 
 
 The queue at the hospital’s gyneacology ward was very long and she had to wait for her turn. After half an hour had passed, the woman went to the toilet and had an unexpected delivery there. This scared her to such an extent that she left the fetus unattended in the toilet and tried to flee. 
 
 The hospital staff found the fetus lying in the washroom and began to search for the mother. They identified her from footage of CCTV cameras installed in the hospital and tracked her down near the hospital exit. They got her admitted to the hospital, and she is currently undergoing treatment. However, due to the premature birth, the fetus died.
 
 “She was visiting the hospital for the first time and did not have any previous health record with her. It was her first child and she had an unplanned delivery inside the toilet. She is now being treated for post-delivery complications and is showing signs of recuperation,” said Dr Pradeep Sharma, principal medical officer, Gurugram.
