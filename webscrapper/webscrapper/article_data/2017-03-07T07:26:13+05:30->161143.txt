CHANDIGARH: Three decades after it first introduced a social-security scheme in 1987, Haryana is now mulling to extend pension to widowers, too, from next year, chief minister   said in the state’s assembly on Monday.

 Khattar gave this assurance during the question hour in the assembly on Monday, ahead of the presentation of the state budget. The statement came in reply to a question by an independent MLA from Samalkha, Ravinder  . “We are contemplating to grant pension to widowers on the pattern of (pension provided to) widows,” the CM said.
 
 A brief moment of laughter followed in the assembly, as Machhrauli thanked the CM by saying that he had thought about the pain of widowers even though he himself was a bachelor. “Chief minister sir, entire Haryana will thank you for this step,” Machhrauli said.
 
 Speaking to TOI, the 42-year-old first-time MLA elaborated on his feeling behind putting forth such a proposal. “Like widows who use the pension for raising their children and other family members, there are many widowers of certain age groups who don’t remarry and are not in the age group of getting old-age pension. Now, since Khattar sahib has announced to consider the demand, both of us will be remembered when widowers draw their pension,” Machhrauli said. “We move in public through day and night, and come across persons who have raised this issue. So, I thought of raising it in the assembly,” he said.
 
 The concept of social-security schemes in Haryana began in 1987, when the then chief minister   had started ‘Samman Allowance’ for the old. The scheme became a hit in Haryana and there are 14.72 lakh beneficiaries under it in the state.
