Trichy: Several engineering students belonging to SC/ST communities held a hunger strike in the city on Saturday demanding that the state government withdraw the orders which had led to a significant cut in their educational scholarship.

 Around 500 students from nine private engineering colleges participated in the protest, which was held from 10am near the Central Bus Stand. 
 
 The government orders (GO 51 and 52), which were issued last August, resulted in cutting back the scholarship from Rs 85,000 to Rs 50,000, affecting roughly 1.4 lakh SC/ST students. 
 
 State organiser of Ambedkar Kalvi Nutrandu Iyakkam, M Bharathan, headed the protest, while state organiser of Marumalarchi Manavar Mandram, Bala Sasi, delivered the introductory speech criticising the government.
 
 Protesters stated that students pursuing various streams were affected since several education institutions had apparently sent circulars that the students stating that they had to pay Rs 35,000 to be eligible to appear for semester exams. The agitators hence asked the students from SC/ST communities to take example from jallikattu protest and organise a similar movement.
 
 Dharmaraj, an engineering student, who participated in the protest, criticised the ruling party for the situation. “While the deceased former chief minister   had issued a government order which ensured that we got the scholarship that we deserved, the current government reduced it significantly. This has significantly affected the  ,” he said.
 
 The agitators also warned that if their demands were not fulfilled by the government within the end of this month, they would be gathering all the students from the SC/ST communities and protest in front of Secretariat in Chennai.
