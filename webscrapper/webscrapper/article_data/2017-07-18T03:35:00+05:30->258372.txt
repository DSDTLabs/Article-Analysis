Mapusa: Savio Almeida was elected as sarpanch and Pratima Govekar as deputy sarpanch of Anjuna panchayat on Monday, after the polls being postponed for over a month due to ward reservation. Govekar was the sarpanch and Almeida her deputy during their previous terms. Scheduled for July 8, the elections had to be postponed further to Monday after the presiding officer fell ill and had to be hospitalised. The opposition panel comprising four out of 11 panchayat members abstained from attending the meeting, said sources. “All like-minded people have come together to work for the development of Anjuna village. Our first priority is to make the village garbage free,” Almeida said, adding that the panchayat will also undertake improvement of playgrounds in the village and build a children’s park if the communidade provides land .
