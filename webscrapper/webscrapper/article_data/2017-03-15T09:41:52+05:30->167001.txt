CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister-designate   made his first   on Tuesday, announcing retired PCS officer M P Singh as his officer on   (OSD).

 Amarinder is expected to replace  , who was in the eye of a storm during the elections. However, the Congress leader may continue with   as the police chief for some time.
 
 A 1983-batch, Punjab-cadre IAS officer,  , who is posted in Delhi on central deputation at present, is a front-runner for the chief secretary's post. Besides, his batchmates K B S Sidhu, the incumbent home secretary, and NS Kalsi, agriculture secretary, are also in the race for the post.
 
 The 1992-batch IAS officer K A P Sinha, who is at present secretary (general administration) of Punjab, is likely to be the principal secretary to the CM. Sinha had earlier served as the principal secretary to Amarinder's wife, Preneet Kaur, during her tenure as Union minister of state for external affairs.
 
 Arora, a 1982-batch IPS officer, had recently sought central deputation. However, non-availability of any top post in a national agency may delay his transfer to Delhi.
 
 While Arora's predecessor DGP Sumedh Singh Saini does not enjoy a good relation with Amarinder, the other 1982-batch IPS officer Sanjiv Gupta is due for retirement in four months. On the other hand, 1985-batch IPS officer DGP Mohammad Mustafa, who is still in the race to be the top cop, may be overlooked for possible conflict of interest, as his wife and Congress's Malerkotla MLA, Razia Sultana, is getting a cabinet berth.
 
 Arora has been under fire ever since the Pathankot airbase attack, as a Parliament committee had found several police lapses.Under Arora's tenure, Punjab had courted huge controversies, as there was no arrests in the assassination of RSS vice -president V P Gagneja and Namdhari sect head Mata Chand Kaur. Even the bomb blast in Maur, just days ahead of the election, had marred his time at the top post.
