PATNA: Leaders of different political parties would gather at SK Memorial Hall here on April 21 under the aegis of Rashtra Manch set up by BJP rebel and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha.

 Addressing a press meet on Wednesday, Manch’s member and former ambassador K C Singh said the convention has been called to to save democracy which is under threat in the present era and the situation in the country is similar to the Emergency period. He said constitutional institutions are working under tremendous government pressure and Parliament is also unable to function under the present government. “The manch is not a political outfit, but a platform for political activism,” he said.
 
  national spokesperson Ghanshyam Tiwary said some top   leaders would attend the convention. “Congress   member Renuka Chowdhury has given her consent to attend the convention. BJP MP  , TMC MP Dinesh Trivedi, AAP’s Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, former   deputy CM Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and several other leaders, including from Samajwadi Party, will attend the convention to expose the wrong policies of the Centre,” he said, adding manch’s convener Yashwant Sinha would also be present in the programme.
 
 He said adding issues like securing farmers’ income, employment to youth, uplift of lower strata people of the society, empowering women and strengthening weaker sections, including scheduled castes and tribes and national security would be discussed in the convention.
