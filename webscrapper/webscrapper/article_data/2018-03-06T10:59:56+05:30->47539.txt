VIJAYAWADA: Though the TDP has kicked up a storm over poor budgetary allocations by the Centre, the party is struggling to hammer out an exit plan from  . According to highly-placed sources, the TDP brass cannot wriggle out of the alliance as the state is staring at a massive financial crunch due to new capital city and mega projects, including Polavaram.

 
 “Senior leaders are cagey about pulling the rug immediately. They didn’t expect it would become a big national issue even as antipathy towards   is growing across AP. We are neither in a position to quit the alliance nor stay with NDA for long. The leadership is in a dilemma,” a top leader told TOI on Monday.
 
 The other worry is the timing. Many party leaders feel that if they call it quits now, sustaining the   till the 2019 election will be a Herculean task. There is also a perception that Naidu won’t go all out against BJP with the vote-for-note case hanging like a Damocles sword.
 
 Another concern among top babus is the mounting expenditure on salaries and pensions. Senior finance officials told TOI that salary and pension payments alone is Rs 1,100 crore every month. The amount is being borrowed from banks every month and repaid after 10-15 days. “After the GST came into force, payments go directly to the central coffers and states receive accruals later. Even a slight delay in reimbursement from the Centre will make matters worse,” a senior IAS officer explained.
 
 Polavaram, Naidu’s main poll plank, also gets environmental clearance from Centre on annual basis. “If the Centre sits on the files, we will be in soup,” sources close to CMO said.
