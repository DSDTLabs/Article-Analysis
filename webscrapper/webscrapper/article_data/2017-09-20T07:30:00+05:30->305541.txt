Mohali: One side of the   near Bhankarpur village on the Chandigarh-Delhi highway remained jam-packed on Tuesday due to repair work on the bridge.

 On Monday the   was diverted to a single lane on the Ghaggar bridge that led to blockage of the damaged lane on the other side. The slow repair work led to the huge traffic jam on both sides of the national highway.
 
 Hundreds of travellers coming and going from Chandigarh were trapped in circuitous queues of vehicles. And those who were travelling in the buses were the worst hit as they were forced to sit inside till the vehicles moved. Commuters were stuck for over half an hour in evening. Those on two-wheelers tried to make their way through the traffic by moving serpentine on kutcha roads.
 
 An official from the GMR company said due to the passing of heavy vehicles round the clock, more damage has been caused to the bridge which is old. Rain hinders with the repair work, he added. “The concrete came off due to which we had to close one side of the bridge. It will take two more days to make the bridge operational if heavy rain doesn’t interrupt the work.”
 
 The traffic snarls started deteriorating after the traffic and GMR officials took care of the problem. Display of boards of diversion were also put up just before the damaged bridge.
 
 People coming from Delhi and going towards Shimla were the one who suffered the most. One of the tourists who was on his way to Shimla with his family said, “Everytime we take this route, there is a traffic jam on this bridge.”
 
 Rajesh Kumar, a Chandigarh resident who works near Lalru, said, “I don’t know why the administration is not repairing and fixing the damaged things once and for all and by the end it is public money that is being used for the construction of the bridge.”
 
 Around six months ago, the concrete on the Derabassi bridge was damaged due to which one side of the road was blocked for two days causing massive hindrance to the commuters.
