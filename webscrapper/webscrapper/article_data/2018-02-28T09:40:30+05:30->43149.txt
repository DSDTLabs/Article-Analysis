JAIPUR: Think of Afghans and the image would be one of strong, well-built men with a rustic touch, who as bowlers come hard at you on a cricket field. However, when you think of successful Afghans on a cricket field, most of them turn out to be spinners, and young ones too. Rashid Khan, Mujeeb Zadran, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Qasis Ahmed,   are all in their teens. All of them also have been in the news recently with their abilty to fox batsmen from established cricketing nations.

 
 Zahir, who is perhaps one of the lesser known names in this lot, did cause a few flutters when   picked him up during the   auctions for Rs 80 lakh. Not a huge amount perhasps, but given that more established spinners like Samuel Badree, Adam Zampa and Ish Sodhi went unsold, this 19-year old did cause a few heads to turn.
 
 “I was surprised too,” Zahir told TOI from Kabul on Tuesday. “But I am going to grab this opportunity.” Zahir has yet to the play for Afghanistan but had been part of the U-19 side for the World Cup.
 
 “We keep on encouraging each other. Star like Rashid speaks to everyone and is always there to help. We know our capabilites and back ourselves completely.”
