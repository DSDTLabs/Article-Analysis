 Deepika is on a sabbatical break to spend some quality time with her son Soham. While talking to Timesofindia, Deepika had spoken about motherhood and said, “Motherhood is a beautiful experience. Besides a biological transformation, I have learned to empathise and sympathise with people around. It’s only when you become a mother, you realise how much your parents must have put in to bring you up. My parents were working, but they made sure to raise us well. They gave us their time. At times, I wonder if I would be able to do so much for Soham.” 
 
 
 On the work front, Deepika is all set to make her comeback on small screen.
