Mumbai: A teacher, Shyam Vishwakarma (30), was   for allegedly beating up a class IX student of Oxford High School in Kurla on Thursday morning.

 The student, Suhail Ansari (14), had undergone a head surgery about three months ago and was still recovering from it. On Thursday, he had a brief argument with the teacher. “He was beaten up badly and rushed home immediately. He was crying and told us that the teacher had hit him with a wooden stick. We went to the school to see the   footage. His head was paining so we rushed him to Sion hospital for treatment and he even fainted on the way. He underwent all medical tests,” said his brother, Shoeb.
 
 School authorities however denied that the teacher had hit the boy on his head. “We have suspended the teacher and issued a memo. We have also submitted the CCTV footage of the incident to the police and are co-operating in the probe. The boy was disturbing the class and misbehaving despite several warning. The teacher only slapped him and hit him on the hand. However, we condemn the act and beating a child isn’t justified. Hence we have taken action from our end to ensure similar incidents aren’t repeated,” said Khan Mohammed Nadeem, manager of the school.
 
 “We have recorded the student’s statement who is recuperating at Sion hospital,” said senior inspector Venkat Patil.
