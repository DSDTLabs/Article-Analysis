KOLKATA: The imminent shift of 81   out of the   main complex promises to bring the Rs 10-crore beautification project back on track. The project, which was originally conceived way back in 2011, got shelved earlier as the traders had refused to move out.

 The traders agreed to relocate after the civic bosses met the   temple committee, sevayat consortium and traders’ forum on Tuesday. 
 
 The traders’ reluctance to move out had delayed the beautification project and also created fears of cost overrun. The Rs 10-crore sanction is only for the first phase of the project, which envisages renovating the Adi Ganga ghats along the temple, broadening the entry and exit roads of the temple, construction of multiple doorways and setting up a new lighting system, among other initiatives.
 
 On Tuesday, the traders readily agreed after they were assured of properly rehabilitation. “The meeting was successful as the stakeholders gave their approval in writing. Now KMC will be able to go ahead with the much-awaited facelift work,” said  , the mayor-in-council member. 
 
 “The boundary separating the temple from doodhpukur (sacred milk pond) will be pulled down to make way for an entry gate to the temple. Besides, three other gates will be constructed to decongest the temple complex. The main temple complex will get widened to avoid a jostle among devotees,” the MMiC said.
 
 When contacted, a member of the traders’ forum said they have sought copies of the KMC plan. He added that they had told civic body officials to make provisions for both entry and exits when they make four gates around the temple. “This apart, we have requested the civic authorities to re-count the number of traders as nearly 10 traders have been left out in the preliminary counting,” the member said.
