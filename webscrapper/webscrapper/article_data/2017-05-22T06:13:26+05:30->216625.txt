 Yoga still seems to be the most popular event of all with people of all age categories participating in it. Meditation sessions were also conducted by the Brahma Kumaris. 
 
 Some were there to have a good time with their little ones. P  , a bank executive who was with his daughter and son, said, “I hardly get to spend time with my kids.

But all thanks to my children who enlightened me I’m here with them today.”
 
 Children had truckloads of fun. While some read out nursery rhymes, a few took the stage by storm by reciting the poems of Saint Vemana and the 13th century Sumathi Sathakam composed by Baddenna Bhupala of the Chalukya Chola dynasty. The girl who recited the the sathakams is Baby Bharathi, a five-year old with an amazingly sweet voice. When she took the stage, she held everybody present spell bound.
