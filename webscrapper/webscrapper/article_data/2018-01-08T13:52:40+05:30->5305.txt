PATNA: The ruling JD (U) on Sunday decided to constitute 60 teams of master trainers to impart training to block level party workers on issues related to CM   Kumar’s pro-people programmes and the organisation’s stand on different issues.

 Each team of master trainers will visit allotted blocks and train the party workers on how to promote   government’s popular programmes like liquor ban, seven resolves, welfare schemes for dalits, Mahadalits and extremely backward classes and Nitish’s zero tolerance on corruption, party’s general secretary (headquarters)   said. The JD (U) has 534 organisational blocks in the state.
 
 Arya added, “Each team will have 13 to 15 trainers. Each trainer will impart training on one given topic in which s/he has some expertise. While one trainer will speak on prohibition, the other will be asked to educate the workers on the CM’s firm commitment for maintenance of social harmony and rule of law in the state.” 
 
 Arya said though the party had so far not finalise programmes for the block level training, the team of master trainers will begin visiting their allotted blocks from February to impart training. 
 
 The party had on Sunday invited 505 leading workers from different blocks to the state capital. These workers were earlier imparted training by senior functionaries of the party between December 1 and 22 last year. The party now plans to select master trainers from the selected workers.
