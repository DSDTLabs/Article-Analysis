BENGALURU: Stating that a separate Karnataka flag and primacy to   language cannot threaten the country’s federal system, former Union finance minister P   on Tuesday backed the   government for whipping up Kannada pride in the upcoming elections.

 
 Chidambaram stressed that both demands of the Siddaramaiah government, if accepted by all political parties, shouldn’t be an “issue”.
 
 “The demand for a separate flag has just a symbolic intent. Even   has a separate flag. In many federal structures across the world, there is always room for regions and states to have their own flags. It’s not an issue. The flag represents people’s will,” he said .
