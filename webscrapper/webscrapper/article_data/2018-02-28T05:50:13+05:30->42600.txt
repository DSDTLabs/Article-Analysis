CHENNAI: Three days after a 34-year-old woman in a dying declaration to the city police said her employer,  , at a diagnostic lab in   had poured   on her and set her ablaze, the wife of the man she accused said her husband was innocent and the woman had killed herself.

 At a press conference on Tuesday, R Lalitha provided an alternative version of what took place at the lab on the night of February 18. She said Yamuna was frustrated and set herself onfire and Raja tried to save her and injured himself in the process, she said.
 
 Raja’s lawyer   said soon after the incident Raja had taken Yamuna to the Chromepet Government Hospital where she told the staff that she sustained burns due to a LPG cylinder blast and was later shifted to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital. “If it was an attempt to murder, she could have blamed him right away,” he said. 
 
 Lalitha blamed the police for not conducting a thorough investigation and added that she will get justice for her husband. 
 
 She also claimed that the incident happened outside the lab and that there were witnesses.
 
 On February 18, Yamuna and her employer, Raja, 40, the owner of Sri Balaji Diagnostics, had had a verbal altercation before Raja allegedly splashed her with surgical spirit and set her on fire in Vanuvampet.
