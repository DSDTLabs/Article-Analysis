Rajkot: In the fast-growing Rajkot city too, sparrows have saviours. For Bharat Sureja (63), a city-based automobile accessories dealer, sparrow conservation has become his life’s prime goal for past 10 years. Sureja’s specially designed sparrow nests have reached many parts of the state as well as outside Gujarat.  “I was always concerned about the depleting green cover and bird conservation. In our concrete houses, there is no space for sparrows to make nests unlike in old houses which had clay ceilings. So, I made a scientifically designed sparrow house which can be placed in the balcony or hanged over the window,” said Sureja, who has a shop on Gondal Road. Sureja embarked on a campaign to connect with maximum number of people in 2008 and started distributing the nests for free.
