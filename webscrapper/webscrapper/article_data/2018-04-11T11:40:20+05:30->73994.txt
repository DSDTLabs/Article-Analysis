 Manjula is the daughter of Dayachari's brother. She along with Dayachari purchased some properties in their native Guntur and Patancheru. Subsequently, financial disputes arose between them. Manjula and her brother Karunakar tried to resolve the matter with Dayachari through multiple meetings in the presence of family members but could not succeed. 
 
 Subsequently, the siblings hatched a plan to eliminate Dayachari and discussed the issue with their friend Venkateswar Rao, who in turn introduced one Naresh from Vijayawada as a suitable man for the task.
 
 The siblings paid 15,000 as advance to Naresh to eliminate Dayachari. A month ago, Karunakar and Rao showed  's house in Prashasan Nagar and also gave him the retired beuraucraut's photo. 
 
 On April 3, Naresh along with his associates Ashok, Sagar, Ayyappa and Rajesh came to Hyderabad and checked into Hotel Minerva at Kondapur. They purchased a cricket wicket at Kondapur and conducted a reece of the victim's house on April 5. The accused noticed that Dayachari would take a morning walk. 
 
 "On the day of the attack, Sagar rode a bike slowly from behind Dayachari. Ashok, who was pillion riding, attacked the victim on his head with the wicket. As the victim collapsed on the road, the accused fled from the scene," West Zone DCP A R Srinivas said. Luckily, the victim escaped with injuries.
