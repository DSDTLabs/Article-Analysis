NEW DELHI: As   Pranab Mukherjee gets ready to vacate  , he leaves behind a   legacy with a soft touch. Under Mukherjee, the presidential estate, a sheltered high-security ‘colony’ with 5,000-odd residents, has taken a different look.
 
  The place has become a smart connected residential complex. Mukherjee would leave behind a new security system as well as efficient water, security and waste disposal systems and new residential blocks with studio apartments. 
 
 Apart from this, he would be remembered for a new approach: 4S. This includes Sanskar, a project for pre-school children; Sparsh, which is designed for differently abled children; Sanskriti, for children in the 7-14 age group and Samaga, targeting senior citizens living in the estate.
