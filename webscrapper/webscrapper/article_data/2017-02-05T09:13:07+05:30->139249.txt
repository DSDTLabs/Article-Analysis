PUNE: Playing in front of his Olympic bronze medallist father Vece and an enthusiastic crowd, more than 3,500 of them,   could not set the Davis Cup record of 43 doubles wins. 

 But he still made himself available for national duty in the future. "I will continue to be available for the country if chosen. Finally, the world record belongs to the country," he said when asked if he will continue his pursuit for win No. 43 after two successive failures.
 
 The 43-year-old, after logging his record 55th Davis Cup doubles match, hinted that selection controversies didn't matter to him much. 
 
 Paes' selection ahead of higher-ranked   for this tie has come under criticism. Non-playing captain   agreed that ranking is not everything while picking a team.
 
 "The team should be picked on the basis of form, fitness and conditions for the tie," he said. Paes said: "We need to put on the best man for the job." 
 
 Amritraj clarified that he insisted on Yuki's inclusion as the third singles player in the four-man team. "We couldn't leave   and Ramkumar out. But we wanted a backup. And Yuki was the automatic choice."
