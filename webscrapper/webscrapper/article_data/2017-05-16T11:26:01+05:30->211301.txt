Trichy: The state government has decided to rope in drivers of private school buses to manage operations of government buses across the state.

 The government has instructed respective regional transport officers to approach private schools for bus drivers. The school education department, through a circular, has asked all private schools to send bus drivers who can operate TNSTC buses. 
 
 The circular sought the help of service-minded drivers to avoid public inconvenience due to the ongoing strike by a section of TNSTC employees. Those possessing heavy passenger motor vehicle (HPMV) licence have been asked to come forward to operate TNSTC buses.
 
 Officials from the school education department in Trichy said that 112 bus drivers possessing HPMV licence have been identified from various schools till Monday evening. However, it is uncertain if the stop-gap arrangement will bear fruit as many of the drivers are out of town due to the ongoing summer vacation in schools. 
 
 “We have prepared a list of 112 drivers. Even if 25% of these drivers turn up it will be a big number,” said an official from the school education department.
 
 Regional transport officials said that they have been directed to clear drivers with HPMV licence, irrespective of schools or colleges they belong to, after a minor driving test.
 
 “We are finding it difficult to identify drivers as many of them are reluctant to turn up. We hope more drivers turn up on Tuesday,” said a transport official.
