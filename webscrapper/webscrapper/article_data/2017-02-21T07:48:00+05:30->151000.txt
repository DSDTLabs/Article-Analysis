GHAZIABAD: Clad in a crumpled dhoti and kurta, seventy five-year-old   sat outside the court staring blankly. His 17-year-old son Parvesh was killed in an encounter 20 years ago. “After my son did not return, I was a bit worried. Three days later, I heard from some reporters who had come to my house that he was killed in an encounter by police,” said Mahender Singh. “The police said that he was a criminal who fired at them. But he was just a simple boy who was trying hard to find a job. On that day, he had gone to   in search of a job,” said Singh.

 Next to Mahender Singh sat 65-year-old Sharifuddin, mother of 20-year-old Jalaluddin. “We did not even got a chance to bury my son and the cops had already cremated him along with others. For 20 years, the case lingered on but I visited court on every hearing with a hope that justice would be done,” added Sharifudin.
 
 In the afternoon, when the court held the cops guilty, the two elderly who had lost their children to police atrocity, comforted each other with moistened eyes. “Our perseverance had paid off. Though it is quite late, nonetheless justice has prevailed,” said Mahender Singh. Pushpa, sister of Ashok, who was also killed in the encounter, said: “It was a day before Diwali when my brother was gunned down. It was after nearly three days that we got to know of the incident. My brother was just 17 and was working with a printing press. He was keen to change the job for monetary benefits. On that fateful day he had gone to Philukhwa looking for a job,” said Pushpa. 
 
 Ashok’s mother Shiela said: “Out of my four children, Ashok was my only son and his father pursued the case till 2008 when he died of heart attack. Had he been alive, he would have been satisfied by the verdict.”
