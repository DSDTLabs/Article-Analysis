AHMEDABAD: A 23-year-old Dalit's moustache has been shaved off allegedly by eight members of the Thakor community at Goral village in  's Sabarkantha district. The police have lodged an FIR and arrested the eight accused and booked them under the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 

 The 23-year-old, identified by cops as Alpesh  , a postgraduate student of social work, was beaten mercilessly for sporting a moustache on February 22. He had to be admitted to hospital.
 
 In October last year, two Dalit youths were allegedly beaten for sporting moustaches at   village in Gandhinagar district. 
 
 "Pandya and two of his friends were going to a Vishnu temple of the village on his motorbike. At that time, three Thakor members - armed with sticks and iron pipes - chased and asked him how he could sport a big moustache. After this, five Thakor members joined and started beating him with sticks and pipes. The accused forcibly shaved Pandya's moustache with a razor," according to the FIR.
 
 Pandya said, "I don't have any personal enmity with anyone in the village. I have been sporting a moustache for two years. My parents have been beaten up by them for my moustache." Village sarpanch Jayanti Patel, however, said, "Pandya had a fight with a girl of the Thakor community about 20 days ago, which may have led to the incident."
