NEW DELHI: Delhi high court on Friday took cognisance of a news report that a gunshot victim was allegedly denied treatment by a private hospital.

 The court said it has to look into the incident and find out if the victim was denied treatment in violation of Supreme Court’s ruling that victims can’t be turned away from getting treatment in medico-legal cases.
 
 The TOI report was brought to the attention of a bench of acting Chief Justice   and Justice C Hari Shankar by a lawyer who sought directions to hospitals, both private and government-run, to not deny treatment in such cases.
 
 He also sought directions from the court to the police for a speedy probe and proper protection to the eyewitnesses as four out of the five accused in the incident are still absconding.
 
 The report mentioned that a 57-year-old   owner,  , and his 26-year-old son, Mayank, were shot allegedly by five men over a dispute relating to a cooler in outer Delhi’s Najafgarh on July 26. Verma died on the spot after being shot in the head. The report also quoted a relative of the victims saying that   would have survived if the first hospital where hewas taken would have admitted him.
 
 The HC bench has transferred the writ to a division bench on the criminal side that will now take up the case on August 2.
