BENGALURU: Union minister H N Ananth   on Wednesday said the central government has no plans to privatise   (BEML). The Centre though had, on January 3, said it has "only deferred the strategic divestment." The defence  , which also manufactures Metro rail coaches, has plants in Bengaluru, KGF and Mysuru. 

  Speaking at the event after handing over the first intermediate car unit comprising three coaches to   (BMRCL), Kumar said: "When BEML employees' union approached me against disinvestment of BEML, I immediately took up the matter with then defence minister   and current defence minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who assured me that no such step would be taken in the interest of the nation and for the benefit of workers." 
 
 Minister of state (defence) Subhash Bhamre, in a written reply in   on January 3, had only said that the Centre has deferred the strategic divestment in BEML. 
 
 In July last year, he had said: "The government has given 'in-principle' approval for strategic disinvestment of BEML to the extent of 26% of government shareholding, with transfer of management control to strategic buyer."
 
 Last September, chief minister Siddaramaiah too wrote to the Centre, urging it to drop plans of divesting from BEML. "...It's a very valuable PSU and cannot be sold to a private sector investor for the sake of achieving the disinvestment target," Siddaramaiah had written.
