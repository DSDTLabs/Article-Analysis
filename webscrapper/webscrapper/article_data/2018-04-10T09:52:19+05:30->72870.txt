PANAJI: A separate four-bedded ward was inaugurated on Monday at the   (IPHB) for juveniles admitted at the facility. 

 The current premises are a temporary arrangement and plans are afoot to shift the ward to a dedicated space in the IPHB’s proposed annexe building.
 
 A separate ward for girls has also been set up following a directive by the high court of Bombay at Goa after a public interest litigation (PIL) that was filed in this regard by Stop Child   (SCAN-Goa). Earlier, girls and boys were admitted to the women’s and men’s wards respectively. Meanwhile, arrangements are being made for another separate six-bedded ward that is expected to be ready for use in the next few days.
 
 “This was possible with the high court’s directive and the advocate general’s intervention. Dean Dr Pradeep   also worked swiftly to create a separate room for the children at IPHB,” said SCAN-Goa co-ordinator advocate  .
 
 The petition highlighted that children lodged at Apna Ghar — a corrective home — and referred to the IPHB are placed among adults in the absence of a separate ward for them. “Placing children among adults suffering from severe mental illnesses harms the children further, rather than doing any good,” said Pinho, adding that, at times, it was noted “the children would copy the behavior of the mentally ill adults in whose company they were kept during their stay at the institute.”
 
 Deepak Dessai, head of the directorate of women and child development, inspected the girls ward on Monday, with Naik and other IPHB officials in attendance.
 
 The PIL is slated for further hearing on Tuesday when the government will inform the court about the compliance to its directives.
