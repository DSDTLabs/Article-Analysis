SURAT: Airports Authority of India (AAI) has shown its readiness to allow entry of BRTS and city buses operated by Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) at the airport premises to facilitate travel by passengers. 

 Airport director has written to the civic body asking it to extend the BRTS and the city bus services to the airport premises. The time slots of the buses should match the arrival and departure of the flights from the airport. The civic body is running the BRTS from   and Pilod till   on Dumas Road. Recently, the civic body introduced direct city buses from   to Dumas as well. 
 
 Sources said private cabs have been charging hefty fares from passengers arriving at the airport in the absence of a reliable public transportation system. The passengers have to pay Rs600 for one-way transfers from airport to different parts of the city. Airport director Pramod Kumar Thakre told TOI, “We have written to the civic body to extend the BRTS and city bus services to the airport premises. The buses could directly come into the airport’s parking area, pick up the passengers and proceed. A discussion was held regarding the bus service at the recently concluded airport advisory committee meeting.”
 
 Thakre added, “Airport transfers are the biggest problem for the passengers. There are very few cabs outside the airport and they too charge hefty fares. If the passengers could find the buses inside the airport premises, they could at least travel to the nearest destination in the city and catch an auto-rickshaw towards their final destination.” ‘We Want A Working Airport at Surat’ members had also represented to the SMC demanding extending of the bus services to the airport premises. WWWAS member   said, “We have received a positive response from the civic body. This is required urgently to facilitate the passengers.”
