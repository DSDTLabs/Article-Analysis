HYDERABAD:   overflowing on road held up traffic for hours and caused severe problems to commuters near Erramanzil on Tuesday.

 For nearly three hours, traffic flow in the busy stretch was brought to a crawl as motorists and pedestrians tried to evade the sewage water covering the road near More megastore. As water gushed out and flooded the roads, traffic from   office towards   Number 1 was hit badly, while there was a spiralling effect on traffic flow towards Khairatabad. “I was stuck in the traffic jam from 12.30 to 2 pm when coming from Khairatabad towards Banjara Hills Road No 1. Traffic moved very slowly the entire distance up to Taj Deccan and then I realised it was due to overflow of sewage water,” said  , a motorist. While Tuesday’s traffic snarl was on an important route used by many citizens, overflowing manholes are a lingering problem in many other areas. 
 
 The frequent overflow of sewage from manholes and sewer lines are giving citizens a tough time. A similar incident was reported from Subhash Nahar area a week back. “For four to five days, we had this problem of overflowing drainage right at a crossroad, making all four sides inaccessible for locals. The incident happened at   area. It was tough for us to navigate through the road and the stench was really bad,” said Murali Krishna, who had made an online complaint to the Water Board.
 
 HMWS&SB receives 10-15 such complaints every day.
