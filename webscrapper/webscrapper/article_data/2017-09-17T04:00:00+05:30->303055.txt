Vadodara: A man residing in Tarsali area of the city died after he was bitten by a stray dog.

 The incident took place when the victim Ranjit Solanki (49) residing in Vishalnagar had gone for a walk recently. A dog that may have been rabid bit him. Solanki did not take any treatment for the bite and fell ill. 
 
 He was hospitalised for treatment, but died on Thursday at the infectious diseases hospital. Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) has been facing embarrassment when it comes to handling the stray dog population. 
 
 Two incidents of stray dog biting citizens were reported in Kamatibaug very recently. However, officials pointed out that deaths of adults due to stray dogs were very rare. “This may have happened only because the person did not take treatment. Our health centres as well as other government hospitals provide free treatment for dog bites,” said an official.
