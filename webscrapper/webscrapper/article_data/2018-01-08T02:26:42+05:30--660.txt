NEW DELHI: As more security personnel fell to terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir this week,   slammed the Modi government that its “muscular” approach in the troubled state had failed to resolve the problem of militancy.

 “It was claimed that the hard, muscular, militaristic approach will put an end to infiltration and militancy. Has it?” former home minister   asked in a series of tweets as more Congress leaders joined him in questioning the Centre on Kashmir.
 
 Chidambaram said the number of civilians and terrorists killed in J&K had doubled from 28 to 57 and from 110 to 218 from 2014 to 2017 respectively. The security personnel killed had also gone up from 47 to 83 in this period.
 
 “If you are one of those who had thought that the hard, muscular, militaristic approach of the government should be given a chance ... you may change your view,” he said.
 
 Pitching for a political solution to the J&K problem, Chidambaram said, “Both AB Vajpayee and   will be remembered for their diligent efforts to find a solution to the issue.”
 
 Former union minister and Rajya Sabha MP   said PM Narendra Modi's rhetoric over J&K had “come apart”. “Soldiers and policemen martyred almost daily. Will government explain? When will we stop losing lives?” he tweeted.
