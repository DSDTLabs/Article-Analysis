LUCKNOW: Late night   and hailstorm brought some respite from   wave conditions, just as the   office had predicted thundershowers in parts of the state this week.

 Met director JP Gupta had said there was possibility of thundershowers and rains due to a low pressure area hovering over central UP. Rains are expected in parts of north-west and north-east UP, even though south and a major part of Bundelkhand will continue to reel under dry and hot weather.
 
 Earlier on Monday, maximum temperatures in the city dropped to 38.2 degree Celsius. It was over 41 degree Celsius on Sunday. The minimum   was 28 degree Celsius, four degrees above normal. The met department predicted the possibility of a strong wind in the next 24 hours, which could bring down the day time temperatures. The minimum temperature in Kanpur fell to over 39 degree Celsius on Monday. It was over 42 degree Celsius on Sunday. By late evening, strong winds were flowing in the city. Gomti Nagar plunged into darkness after 9 pm.
 
 The thundershowers and rains may, at the same time, result in increased humidity in the state. Gupta said the emergence of winds from south-east was also resulting in an increased humidity levels. “But that is expected to reduce the day time temperatures,” met director said.
 
 Banda was the hottest district in UP on Monday with maximum temperature at 46 degree Celsius, three degrees above normal. It was followed by Jhansi at 44.7 degree Celsius. East UP, too, reeled under heat wave conditions with districts like Allahabad and Varanasi recording the maximum temperatures of 42 degree and 39 degree Celsius, repectively. In west UP, Agra sizzled at 43.4 degree Celsius, while Aligarh recorded the maximum temperature of 42 degree Celsius.
