PUNE: The foot overbridges (FOBs) at   Road and Currey Road railway stations in Mumbai will open for pedestrians by mid-February, commandant of Bombay Engineering Group and Centre (BEG & C) Brigadier   said on Thursday. The Ambivli station overbridge will open on January 31.

 As many as 23 people died in a stampede on the overbridge at Elphinstone Road railway station on September 29, 2017. 
 
 Railway minister  , defence minister   and chief minister   announced that the army would construct the overbridges at the three stations.
 
 “ We will launch the bridges at Elphinstone station on January 26 and 27 and on February 4 at Currey Road station. Both bridges will be operational by the second or third week of February.” Mohan said.
 
 The effort was to deliver quality work and finish within the deadline, he added. “We need extra days to dry the piled foundation for best results. We cannot compromise on quality as the bridges should be in place for over 50 years," he said.
 
 The Currey Road work was stuck in land issues, but the bridge will be ready in the second week of February, Mohan said.
 
 Mohan said Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has been using Bailey bridges in Jammu & Kashmir and the northeast. "These bridges can sustain extreme weather conditions. The BRO has constructed over 500 such bridges in these regions and they are stable even after decades. The FOBs in Mumbai will sustain for 50 years,” he added.
