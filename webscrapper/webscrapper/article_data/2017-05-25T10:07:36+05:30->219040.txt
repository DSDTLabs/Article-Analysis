UDAIPUR: The   (ACB) sleuths on Wednesday arrested three officials, including a junior engineer posted at the   (CAD) in Kota, for taking bribe of Rs 60,000 against releasing an arrear of Rs 10 lakh rupees due to a gardener employed in the office.

 Engineer  , accountant Avdhesh Sharma and clerk Arvind Rajawat were caught red-handed while accepting the sum, Kiran Kang, Kota SP (ACB) said.
 
 The ACB action came as a big shock for the CAD staff who fled from the office. The place wore a deserted look until afternoon when gradually the remaining staff got back to work.
 
 Complainant Ram Kishan joined as a gardener at the CAD in 1988. However, he was removed from the job in 1991. “The poor man fought a long legal battle and got re-instatement order in 2003. However, the CAD filed an appeal but lost the case in the high court and Ram Kishan was taken back to work in 2005,” additional SP Chandra Sheel Thakur told TOI.
 
 In November 2016, Ram Kishan got orders to receive an arrear of Rs 11 lakh rightfully due to him from the department. After an income tax deduction of 1 lakh, the man waited to receive Rs 10 lakh arrear amount, however, the CAD officials didn’t release the sum and Shringi demanded Rs 1 lakh i.e 10% of the sum due as commission against its release. The poor man pleaded with the officials and finally the bribe money was settled at Rs 60,000 by the latter. However, Ram Kishan who had already spent a large amount to pay fees to the lawyers, refused to resign and informed the ACB. The department verified the complaint and a trap was laid on Wednesday, Thakur said.
 
 The officials were caught red-handed with the bribe money and arrested. The   constituted of Dileep Singh, Mohammad Aslam, Narendra Singh, Satyendra Singh, Devendra Singh, Md Khaaliq, Manoj Sharma, Shabana, Suwalal, Jogendra and Rajendra Malav.
