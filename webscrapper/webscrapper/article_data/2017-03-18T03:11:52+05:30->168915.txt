NEW DELHI: Riding high on its electoral victory in Uttar Pradesh and Uttrakhand,   is pitching for a direct fight with AAP in the   bypoll. But its ally SAD (Badal), which has been contesting from this assembly seat since 2008, is not willing to relinquish its claim. 

 On Friday, senior leaders and MPs of both parties met to settle the issue. “But there is no consensus yet,” said a source. SAD (Badal) won from Rajouri Garden twice, in 2008 and 2013. 
 
 The by-election, scheduled on April 9, will set the tone for the municipal polls on April 22. “It is important to win this bypoll as it will give us momentum in the municipal polls,” said a BJP member.
 
 Many functionaries claim the party has a better chance to win the seat than its ally owing to the “Modi wave”. BJP’s national general secretary, R P Singh, said, “The public mood is in our favour. BJP should contest the election on its own symbol.”
 
 Some also feel that the defeat in Punjab will impact SAD (Badal)’s chance here. But SAD members cite the party’s recent victory in the gurdwara elections and are confident of winning the Punjabi-Sikh-dominated constituency. “We have told BJP that we want to contest on our symbol. We have won it in the past and will win it again,” said Manjit Singh GK, president of SAD (Badal) in Delhi.
 
 The seat fell vacant after AAP MLA Jarnail Singh resigned to contest in the Punjab elections. Though Singh lost, sources said, AAP is likely to field a new candidate. 
 
 Congress, trying to revive itself after its 2015 rout, has fielded Khyala councillor Meenakshi Chandela. BJP members said the party should choose a strong candidate to counter Congress, which will project its recent victory in Punjab to woo voters. A decision will be taken after BJP’s booth-level workers’ meet on Sunday, said sources.
