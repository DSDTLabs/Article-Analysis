 Collegium meet to present facts on Justice Joseph issue
 
 The Centre returned to the SC this week its recommendation for Justice K M Joseph's elevation, citing factors like seniority, balanced regional representation and the need to increase the presence of representatives of SCs and STs on the benches of the apex court.
 
 Justice Joseph said the meeting of the   scheduled for Wednesday would present "facts" on the Justice K M Joseph issue. "What the government thought were facts are not facts, and the actual facts would be presented to them," he said.
 
 The SC judge said he was fully optimistic about the outcome of the meeting of the collegium. "The fact, the figures behind the earlier recommendation would be explained to the government. When facts and figures are presented, the government will realise what the actual facts are, and they may change their views," he said.
