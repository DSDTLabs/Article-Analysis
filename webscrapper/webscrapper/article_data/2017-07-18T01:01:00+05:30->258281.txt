The recent eviction of   from   is creating endless ripples in its wake. Students — former and present — are proving that Pramodda is indeed the fourth ‘P’ of Presidency after porashona, politics and prem. While the present students are busy campaigning and are talking constantly to the authorities, former students are also doing their bit to help Pramodda.
 
  After being evicted from campus, it was a former student who gave Pramodda a place to sleep at night. Besides, a group of ex-students is working to get him the necessary paperwork like food and trade licences. “Many influential alumni have already spoken to the authorities on the matter. The authorities told us that they want Pramodda to stay,” said  , president of Presidency Alumni Association. However, currently, after seeing the tender notice, the association thinks that this is a calculated step by the authorities to evict Pramodda and prevent him from bidding for the tender. “The clause says the bidder must have a turnover of `50 lakh annually, which is ridiculous. Besides, they have asked for a multicuisine restaurant and Pramod cannot deliver that,” said Bivas, adding the authorities can make a new   in place of the other canteens and leave Pramod alone.
