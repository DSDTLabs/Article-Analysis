BHOPAL: Close on the heels of the controversy surrounding fee payment to noted lawyer   by Delhi chief minister   in a defamation case, the Congress in   has turned the tables on the   over a similar issue. 

 State Congress chief spokesman KK Mishra on Thursday alleged that Madhya Pradesh chief minister   has also paid a lawyer, who represented his case in the dumper scam lawsuit at the rate of Rs 11 lakh per hearing, from the state exchequer. 
 
 "The duplicity of the BJP has been exposed. While it is out to denounce Kejriwal for payment of fee to Jethmalani in Delhi with public money, they have shut their eyes to the payments made by their own government, which pays the lawyer in the chief minister's corruption case from the state exchequer," he said. In the dumper scam case of Ramesh Sahu versus Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the state government appointed senior counsel Uday U Lalit (now justice of SC) at the cost of Rs 11 lakh per hearing, alleged the Congress. "It was ascertained that the payment would be made by the general administration department (GAD)," claimed Mishra. 
 
 "Orders were issued to this effect by the law department on December 9, 2011. How can the BJP justify Shivraj Singh Chouhan government's payment of Rs 11 lakh per hearing to Uday Lalit?" he asked.
 
 Union finance minister Arun Jaitley had filed a defamation suit against Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal after the latter accused Jaitley of corruption in the DDCA (Delhi and District Cricket Association). 
 
 The case for Kejriwal is being represented by Ram Jethmalani and BJP criticised the Delhi government's decision to pay the renowned lawyer's fee from the government exchequer. In 2007, Congress leader and lawyer Ramesh Sahu registered a complaint against the chief minister for alleged anomalies in dumper purchase in the court.
