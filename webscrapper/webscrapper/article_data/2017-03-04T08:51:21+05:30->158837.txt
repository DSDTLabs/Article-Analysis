AHMEDABAD: The ongoing probe by   ( ) in the multi-crore cash-for-marks racket at the Waghodia-based   took a curious turn on Friday when investigators found a transaction of Rs 3,00,000 done from a Raopura-based foreign exchange firm. 

 The money was transferred by Vinod Sawant, one of the accused in the case, to his son Dixit who is based in China. Sources said that the transaction was made by Sawant just two days before the search at   Vidyapeeth by ACB on Tuesday. 
 
 The ACB trap on Tuesday was made when Sawant along with Ashok Tailor had accepted Rs 20 lakh from parents of an MBBS student at the college to allow her take the final-year exam. Subsequent searches had unearthed 220 cheques worth Rs 102 crore from Mansukh Shah’s office.
 
 “Further probe is to ascertain whether more such transactions were made by any of the accused. It is suspected that the foreign exchange route was taken to convert the black money into white,” said an official.
 
 Meanwhile, ACB has found a locker in the name of Sumandeep founder Mansukh Shah and seven accounts in the name of his relatives which are under scrutiny for any cross-transactions. The five teams probing the 220 cheques have started approaching the issuers to record their statements.
 
 “We are also awaiting the voice spectrography test at   (DFS),  , for the three accused in the case. The test would confirm that those speaking on phone with the complainant in the case were indeed the accused,” said an ACB official.
