NEW DELHI: As the paralysis in   entered the third week, the opposition on Tuesday accused the government of not letting the two Houses function to escape critical issues being raised by political parties. Ten political parties in   met in the morning and decided to take up three issues — bank scam, Cauvery water board and special category status for Andhra Pradesh. 

 
  decided to take the same position in Lok Sabha too. As the two Houses again failed to transact business, leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said the government had made no effort to resolve the deadlock through negotiations as happens in democracy. Congress chief whip in Lok Sabha Jyotiraditya Scindia said the opposition had supported the two noconfidence motions pending in the   but the government did not want a discussion on them. 
 
 BJP allies   and TRS were protesting in the well while not a single Congress MP was disrupting the proceedings, he said. “This is a conspiracy by the government to ensure that Parliament does not function,” Scindia said, asking why the parliamentary affairs minister had not reached out to any opposition party in the last 12 days. 
 
 “The entire opposition holds that the government is responsible for the impasse and for not taking any interest in the functioning of Parliament,” Azad said, adding, “The government is very scared of the bank scam. They know that they can’t face the public.”
