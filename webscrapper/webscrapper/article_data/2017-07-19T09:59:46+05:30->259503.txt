LUCKNOW: The body of a class IV employee of   (NBRI) was found in   in the   of Mahanagar on Tuesday evening. 

 The area is one of the busiest markets and is a hub of jewellery shops, clothing stores and restaurants. Many come to the park for evening walks. According to police, some shop owners had spotted the body lying at one end of the park and alerted the police. When police frisked the body, they found a payslip from NBRI in a pocket and ascertained its identity. Mahanagar inspector Vivek Pandey said the body was identified as that of   (55) of Gudamba who worked at NBRI in Hazratganj. Pandey said the body bore no injury marks. "The body has been sent for autopsy," he said. 
 
 Prima facie, it seemed that an overdose of drugs or too much of alcohol might have led to the death, as some of the people had seen Mayaram in an inebriated state. Mayaram's son Mukesh said though the man drank often, the way his body was found in a park didn't seem right. The deceased is survived by his widow and five children.
 
 Satyadeo Pandey of Mahanagar, who comes for a walk in the park, said, "I have been coming here for the past three years but something like this has never happened before."
