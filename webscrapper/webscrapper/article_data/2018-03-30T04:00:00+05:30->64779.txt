Rajkot: Chief minister Vijay Rupani claimed on Thursday that Rajkot city won’t face water crisis even during peak summer. “We brought water in Aji dam under SAUNI scheme while the city is getting supply from Surendranagar’s Dholi Dhaja dam,” he said. 

 However, he condemned the incident of valve leakage in Suryarampara village near Rajkot which resulted in huge quantity of water coming to Aji dam getting wasted. On pending payment of MSP to groundnut farmers, he said, “Last installment of groundnut has not been paid to farmers but the money would be released soon.” tnn
