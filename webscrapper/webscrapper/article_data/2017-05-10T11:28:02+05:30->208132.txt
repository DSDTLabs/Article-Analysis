KOLHAPUR: In protest against the state government's efforts to save the liquor shops around 500 metre from the state and national highways, the   (MANS) has decided to launch a state-wide campaign on making the state addiction free. 

 Accusing the government for its pro-liquor policy, executive president of MANS,   said, "The government is encouraging liquor consumption with this policy to earn maximum revenue from people's pockets. It does not care about its citizens. Despite several demands from the rural folk on complete ban of liquor, the government has not taken any decision on the liquor ban yet. Around 3.5 lakh people and 1,300 grampanchayats in the   district have raised a voice against the liquor addiction, but the state government has not taken a decision on the liquor ban till now. So, we have decided to organise a state-wide campaign for an addiction-free Maharashtra. We will form the district-level groups of people to pressurise the government to change its policy on liquor."
 
 The social boycott act bill passed by the state has been pending with the central government for a final nod from the president. "The act is historic and should get the final nod from the president as early as possible. Once we have achieved the feat of the bill, we are planning to conduct a state-wide convention to welcome the act and make the state liquor addiction free," said Patil.
 
 Speaking about the organisation, Patil said, "The last three-and-half-years have been a struggle to bring justice for late  . Now, we are concentrating on strengthening the organisation. District-wise tours have been arranged to reinvent the organisation."
