NEW DELHI: Delhi Development Authority ( ) is likely to approve on Friday a proposal to increase the   ( ) for   and reduce the penalty amount for non-payment of conversion charges from 10 times to two times.

 However, the FAR approval will be subject to certain conditions, including availability of parking space and statutory clearances related to building bylaws and fire safety. Sources said these conditions might pose a hurdle in giving the traders being affected by the sealing drive the desired relief.
 
 DDA officials said parking space was essential as commercial activity would be allowed on all floors. Shop-cum-residence plots are proposed to be given the “FAR of residential plots subject to availability of parking”, according to the agenda circulated by DDA.
 
 The local bodies concerned, along with the traders’ organisations, will have to develop land for shared/common parking facilities. Otherwise, the local bodies will have to declare such areas as “pedestrian shopping streets” and the transport department will make arrangements for last-mile connectivities.
 
 Another proposal seeks to allow commercial activities in basements. This, too, will be subject to similar conditions. 
 
 DDA will also consider norms for redevelopment of godown clusters in non-conforming areas and on agricultural land. Sources said most godowns were located in these areas. But in the absence of a policy for warehouses, the SC-appointed monitoring committee has been taking action in these areas. There will be two criteria for the clusters of godowns that have come up on four hectares of contiguous land or on individual plots. 
 
 After its Authority decides, DDA will invite suggestions from the public within three days. This move to reduce the notice period from 45 days has come under criticism.
