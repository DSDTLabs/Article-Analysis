 “India is the world’s second largest producer of food after China and yet, our per capita packaging consumption is less than $15 against the worldwide average of nearly $100. This is why a lot of food goes to waste,” Baliga said while announcing a one-day workshop on packaging of fresh and processed foods for micro, small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs) that will be held on Friday.
 
 Goa’s domestic food market has grown by nearly 40% to touch $258 billion in 2015. MSMEs could tap the demand by providing eco-friendly and cost effective packaging material, Baliga said.
