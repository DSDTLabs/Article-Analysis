ROHTAK: Exposing chinks in the  , state’s former home minister and party media in-charge Subhash Batra on Thursday lashed out at two-time chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda by saying he did not need any loyalty certificate from the latter to prove his commitment for the party.

 He was reacting to Hooda’s recent statement that Batra should validate whether he was in Congress or not. Batra, who was once a confidante of former CM late Bhajan Lal, had joined   (BL) and was said to be equally close to top leadership of the Indian National Lok Dal as well as the BJP. His easy approach to keep connections with all political parties and leaders and even hosting them always keeps the people guessing about his next move.
 
 Addressing a press conference at his residence on Thursday, Batra also dubbed Hooda as anti-Dalit who couldn’t digest the fact that a Dalit was holding the reins of Haryana Pradesh Congress Committe.
 
 Former Rohtak MLA Batra alleged that had Hooda been a sympathiser of Haryana Congress chief Ashok Tanwar, he would have extended support when a murderous attack was made on the Dalit leader.
 
 He also alleged that Hooda had played a crucial role in ensuring defeat of Congress candidate and lawyer R K Anand in the   elections in Haryana. Questioning the role of Hooda during the Jat agitation for reservation in February 2016, he asked the former CM to tell where was he when Haryana was engulfed in arson and violence.
