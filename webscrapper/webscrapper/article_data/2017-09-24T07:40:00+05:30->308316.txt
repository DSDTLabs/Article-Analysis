Ludhiana: To curb the encroachments on shamlat lands (joint land of village panchayat) the local bodies department has asked the MC Commissioner to get these lands transferred to the name of MC by the end of this month. In case they fail to do so they should intimate the department while giving a clarification.

 Encroachments surface over shamlat lands and it becomes difficult to get the possession because the encroachers claim that it has been donated. Moreover in some of the cases it has been found that the land actually belongs to MC but the department has no record. 
 
 Recently in a case the government had sought record from the civic officials about the encroachments on MC lands in the East constituency after the officials refused having any land in posession. However when it was checked through the sub registrar office only, then MC officials came to know that the land belonged to the department and was getting encroached. 
 
 Requesting anonymity one of the civic officials however claimed that for many years, several court cases are continuing in similar cases where people are struggling to get possession of the land. He said that in some of the cases, despite court orders they had to apply force to get the possession and remove the encroachers therefore it will be a wise step to register the land in the name of MC. He claimed that though there is less time for fulfilling the directions but they will try to implement the same. 
 
 Notably, the director local bodies department, K K Yadav has asked municipal corporation commissioners in all major cities to issue the certificates that they have completed the procedure and will explain why lands could not be transferred.
