SALEM/DHARMAPURI: The   state government has allotted Rs 5.27 crore to set up new forensic science labs in Salem and Dharmapuri districts. 

 The existing forensic science lab at Maravaneri in Salem is reeling under infrastructure constraints as it had been set up for the integrated Salem range comprising Salem, Namakkal, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri about three decades ago. Even after bifurcation of Salem district, no separate labs were set up for other districts and they were using this lab.
 
 More than 14,000 weapons, including knives, sickles, iron rods and wooden logs, were brought from Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts to the Salem lab for foresenic examination. As there is a dearth of space, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the lab to keep the weapons.
 
 “About 3,000 crimes cases were registered in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts in 2016,” said an official from the forensic science lab, requesting anonymity. He told TOI that the space in the present lab was too small to keep items from the two districts. Besides, the lab has to keep weapons from Namakkal and Salem districts.
 
 Deputy director of the forensic science lab A Kolinjiappan and Salem district SP P Rajan requested the state government to open separate labs for Salem and Dharmapuri districts. “The Salem district SP strongly argued for a separate lab in the letter to the government,” an official said.
 
 Following this, the state government allotted Rs 3.68 crore for a bigger lab for Salem district and Rs 1.59 crore for Dharmapuri district. “While the new lab in Salem will be constructed at  , the location is not yet finalised in Dharmapuri district,” the official said. The forensic examination for crimes in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts will be conducted in the Dharmapuri lab, he added.
 
 Kolinjiappan thanked   and the state government for taking efforts to build new labs.
