NAGPUR: “We are living in a fallacy that all traditional foods are healthy and non-traditional ones are junk! The definition of junk is still not clear,” said   during an expert talk on ‘How junk is your  ?’ at   on Friday. The lecture was an initiative by department of home science under the awareness programme campaign ‘Ban on Junk Foods’ issued by   (UGC).

 The talk was an attempt to sensitize the students on ill effects of junk food. Former professor in food technology at LIT, Shastri is passionate about promoting nutrition and health. She said, “Snack food, fast food,   and junk are altogether different concepts. Food which is not wholesome is junk.”
 
 Shastri described what wholesome food is. “It pleases the palate, satisfies the hunger, supplies necessary nutrients, does not stuff the body with undesirable calories, does not cause illness.” 
 
 She threw light on the grave problem existing currently, ‘hidden hunger’ which is a form of undernutrition. Shastri revealed, “Foods rich in calories cause brain to give a sense of fullness to stomach. But it lacks other required micronutrients. This causes hidden hunger which is observed in the affluent sections of society as well.” 
 
 Indicators for junk food were discussed. “We must develop a habit to read labels on food items. Check out the total calories. If it shows more than 550 calories or 100 grams then it is potential junk food,” she said.
 
 Shastri insisted to students to calculate their BMI (body mass index) themselves. She said, “Instead of skipping meals and starving on purpose, exercise is the key to eliminate fat and cut down on calories.” She urged them not to get carried away by advertisements as every company has the right to make profit. “We should be well aware to make a wise choice and eat healthy,” she said.
