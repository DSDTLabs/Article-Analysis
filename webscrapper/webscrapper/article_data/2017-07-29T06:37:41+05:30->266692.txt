KOLKATA: CID is likely to record the statement of Rajya Sabha MP Roopa Ganguli in the   child trafficking case on Saturday. “We plan to record the statement at her residence,“ said a top CID officer.

 Meanwhile, BJP national secretary Kailash   -who did not turn up at Bhawani Bhawan on Thursday after being summoned by CID in the same case -has sent a letter to the state agency informing them he has received anticipatory bail in this case from the   high court. His lawyer had earlier informed CID that Vijayvargiya was in Dehradun attending an MLAs' training session. CID sources said that though Vijayvargiya had received anticipatory bail, they were exploring legal options to at least record his statements.
 
 The CID sleuths also confirmed that Vijayvargiya's personal assistant Prashant Sareen -whose conversation with chief accused BJP leader   forms the basis of this case -too did not respond to summons.
