PATIALA: Following tough resistance from SAD and the Congress, the Union government has rejected the proposal to set up a nuclear power plant near here. Union minister of state in the   had in September 2016 put on record that the Centre was exploring the possibility of having nuclear plants in some places, including Dehradun in Utarakhand and another near Patiala in Punjab, prompting a strong reaction from   and the Congress.

 The Akalis, who were in power at that time, had stated, “Our stand on the issue is very clear. We will never allow any nuclear project to come up in the state at any cost.” Punjab chief minister   had also opposed the move, claiming that a nuclear plant in the border state could prove disastrous for the country, given its proximity to Pakistan.
 
 The Union cabinet on Wednesday cleared a proposal to indigenously build 10 atomic reactors, the largest-ever approval granted for such facilities in one go, at Mahi Banswara (Rajasthan), Chutka ( ), Kaiga (Karnataka) and Gorakhpur (Haryana) while the idea to have such a plant near Patiala was dropped. A team of central agencies had been looking for possible sites to set up a plant in Patiala. The idea was to set up nuclear plants in the northern states to bring atomic energy northward.
 
 Prem Singh Chandumajra, who is an Akali MP from Anandpur Sahib, said given its geographic location, Punjab was least suited to have a nuclear plant. He said such plants should be set up in Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh. Experts in the power sector said it was not a good idea to have more power plants in Punjab as the state was already facing the problem of surplus electricity and no buyers.
