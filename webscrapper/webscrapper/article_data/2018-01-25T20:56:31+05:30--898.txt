LUDHIANA: The much controversial movie “Padmaavat” would be released in the city amid tight security on Thursday. Considering the sensitivity of the situation, the city police have geared up to restrict people from gathering around multiplexes.

 
 
 On Wednesday, the premier of the movie was released amid tight security, which senior officers supervised.
 
 Joining different outfits protesting across the country against the movie, the All India Hindu Students’ Federation handed over a memorandum to the district administration, seeking a ban on the release. On Tuesday, the federation had burnt an effigy of director   Bhansali.
 
 Federation president Parvinder Bhatti said, “Making a change in the name of the movie will not solve the matter.   holds great historic significance and we cannot allow anyone to defame her and our history. We have given a memorandum to the administration, which can deploy police force, but we will make all possible efforts to stop the release.”
 
 All the multiplexes in Ludhiana are releasing the movie after getting assurance from the local police and the administration. Duty manager of PVR Cinemas at   Vikas   said, “We are going to release the movie. We have approached the local police for security arrangements.”
 
 Deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Ashwani Kapoor said, “Special police teams will be deployed outside multiplexes to avoid mob gathering around the premises. There were two to three premier releases on Wednesday for which security was provided.”
