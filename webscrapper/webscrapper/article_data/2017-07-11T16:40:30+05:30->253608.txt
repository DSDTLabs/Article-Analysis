 This   was my last one in Pune, and the celebration turned out to be a very blissful, yet emotional one. Eid is always best celebrated with the family, and it’s on days like these that I tend to miss home a lot. This year though, I was honoured to celebrate Eid with the Chadian community. I was also breaking my fast with them during  .
 
  
 Approximately 30 of us gathered. It felt very homely. We prepared cuisines from different African countries; Chad, Sudan and The Gambia. The togetherness we felt was something I can’t put into words. We felt warmth being radiated with everyone wishing one another. We prayed and ate together. Eid could never have been better!
