PATNA: Bihar finance minister   proposed no fresh taxes while presenting a slightly over Rs 1.60 lakh crore budget for 2017-18 in the state assembly on Monday. 

 “The uniform   (GST) regime will come into force in the country in July and, therefore, no fresh taxes have been announced,” Siddiqui said, adding that the budget presented is Rs15,389.42 crore more than Rs1.44 lakh crore budget of the current fiscal ending on March 31.
 
 Like in the previous five fiscals, the budget for 2017-18 is also revenue surplus, allowing investment in physical infrastructure for the creation of productive capital assets related to roads, buildings, power, schools, health centres and irrigation facilities, among others, Siddiqui said.
 
 During 2017-18, the state has revenue surplus of Rs14,555.59 crore, which is 2.30% of the   (GSDP) estimated to be over Rs6.32 lakh crore. Comparatively, the revenue surplus for 2015-16 was Rs12,507.16 crore, or 2.57% of its GSDP, as per the norms of the fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) Act, 2006.
 
 The state’s revenue receipts, including its share in central taxes, its own taxes, non-tax revenue and grants-in-aid from central government, is estimated to be to the tune of Rs1.37 lakh crore. This includes state’s own tax revenue of Rs32,001 crore, including the expected around Rs22,000 from commercial taxes. 
 
 Complying with the FRBM Act, the fiscal deficit for 2017-18 is Rs18,112 crore at 2.87% of the GSDP, while the outstanding public debt for 2017-18 has been estimated to be Rs1.23 lakh crore, which is 19.47% of the GSDP. The total debt, including liability in public account estimate, is Rs1.47 lakh crore (or 23.29% of the GSDP).
 
 Siddiqui said the imposition of total prohibition in the state had not substantially impacted the total revenue receipts of the state, as the revenue yielded by the excise department was only Rs3,141 crore during 2015-16 against the often touted figures of Rs5,000-6,000 crore quoted in the media. The revenue returns from the commercial taxes department would be able to offset the revenue loss caused by prohibition.
 
 Besides, as earlier suggested by the commercial taxes minister  , the state government is also likely to announce its new one-time settlement (OTS) scheme to resolve tax disputes and get added revenue yields to further maximize tax collection for the current fiscal, sources said.
 
 Siddiqui said, in tune with the changes introduced by the Centre from the current fiscal, the practice of making budgetary allotments under the two broad sub-heads (plan and non-plan funds) has been done away with. The allotments now would be put under four heads — establishment and committed expenditure (like pay, allowances and pension), annual scheme, central sponsored scheme and central sector scheme, he added.
 
 For 2017-18, the establishment and committed expenditure is to the tune of Rs78,818.46 crore (Rs6,541.51 crore more than the last fiscal). Similarly, the annual scheme outlay is at Rs80,891 crore (Rs9,389 crore more than the last fiscal) and central sector scheme at Rs375.62 crore, Siddiqui said.
