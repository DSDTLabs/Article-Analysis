FM  's move to reduce income tax for smaller companies with annual turnover up to Rs 50 crore to 25% from the existing 30% may not mean much for MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises). Reason: most of them are run either as proprietorships or partnership firms.

 The move, however, will make  's MSME sector--one of the most robust in the country-more competitive as compared to larger companies. “The overall tax incidence will be much higher in a company format,“ said K Ilango, former chairman, CII, Coimbatore zone.
 
 MSMEs that are registered as companies would have to pay dividend distribution tax in addition to the income tax making it an expensive proposition. “It (reduction in income tax) won't benefit MSMEs in a big way as they are predominantly either proprietorships or partnerships,“ said M Kandhaswami, former president, Codissia ( ). The Coimbatore region alone is home to nearly 25000 MSME units but only about 2% are registered as companies, Ilango said. “There wouldn't be much in terms of tax savings for these MSMEs,“ he said.
 
 MSMEs account for about 80% of the units located in the knitwear cluster of Tirupur. But nearly 50% of them are run either as partnerships or proprietorships. The budget move, however, would encourage these fir ms to register themselves as companies, said Raja M Shanmugham, president, Tirupur Exporters' Association.
 
 Compliance has also been quite poor. More than 5000 firms or about 40% of the companies registered under the 'Companies Act' with the 'Registrar of Companies' failed to file the mandatory statutory returns in 2015.The Coimbatore region covers nine districts in TN.
 
 MSMEs also said that the budget did not offer much to encourage capital investments. “Though a reduction in tax rate is welcome, it is disappointing that there are no incentives for SMEs to invest in plant and machinery expansion,“ said K K Rajan, president, Southern India Engineering Manufacturers' Association.
