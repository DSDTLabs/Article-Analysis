BHUBANESWAR: The   (OSPCB) on Monday served show-cause   operating in Khurda's Tangi for violating pollution control norms. It also issued them an advisory to contain   in the peripheral areas. 

 The pollution panel's move followed a directive from the Orissa high court to look into the pollution control norms of the quarries. The HC acted on the petition of a green campaigner Manabhanjan Champatiray, who alleged that stone pieces are flying out of the quarries endangering the lives of people living nearby.
 
 The HC has given two-month time to the pollution watchdog to rein in the quarries and file a status report. "We will file the status report in the third week of April after getting the response to the show-cause notices that have been slapped on the quarry owners," said OSPCB regional officer (Bhubaneswar) Hadibandhu Panigrahi.
 
 The pollution board has categorically directed the quarries not to use high-intensity explosives to blast the rocks as that is giving rise to fly-rock. We have found flouting of norms in two components - one is use of high-intensity explosives and air pollution due to lack of proper maintenance and measures to suppress dust, added the  .
 
 Champatiray had moved the HC against the quarry in April, 2016 after which it asked the pollution board to look into the complaints and dispose the case. "We have categorically mentioned in the advisory that the quarry owners should use water sprinklers to suppress dust on the roads being used for transportation of stones, on the site, where the blasting takes place and the dump yard," said the officer. The pollution panel has asked them to take the steps immediately. If they don't comply with the norms, they will be served closure notice, he added.
