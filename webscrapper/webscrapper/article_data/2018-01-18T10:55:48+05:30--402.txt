KOCHI: The Kerala High Court on Wednesday allowed 45 days more to Vigilance and   (VACB) to file the report of further investigation in bar bribery case involving former finance minister  

 Time was granted by the court after considering VACB’s plea for additional time. A petition filed by KM Mani challenging a vigilance court’s order for conducting a further investigation in the case. He has contended that the further investigation was ordered even after not obtaining any evidence against him in the two probes conducted earlier.
 
 When the case came up for hearing on Wednesday, VACB submitted a report to the   cover. After perusing the report, the court said it can allow 45 more days to complete the probe. But this was opposed by Mani’s counsel by alleging that the case has been going on for years and that one more month was granted to the investigation agency when the case was considered earlier. The agency should not be granted additional time, the counsel argued.
 
 However, the court pointed out that VACB is seeking one month to complete the probe and 15 days for filing the report. The report filed by VACB now is satisfactory, the court said while granting 45 days more to the agency.
 
 While considering the former minister’s petition, the court had asked VACB to inform about the hardcore evidence it unearthed during the investigation that prompted it to register an FIR despite ruling out a probe twice earlier.
 
 In ordering a further investigation, the vigilance court had, according to VACB, directed for clearing the ambiguity regarding handing over of Rs50 lakh. The vigilance court had also asked for analyzing the phone and the SD card containing the alleged conversation of bar owners association and had directed that a   is required about the quantum of money collected by the bar owners association as  , VACB had told the high court.
