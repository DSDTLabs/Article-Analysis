 Sources said the ULB department gave the go-ahead to the DPR for DLF 1 and 2, Sushant Lok and Palam Vihar on Wednesday, at a meet attended by senior officials of the department of town and country planning. 
 
 Anand Mohan Sharan, principal secretary of ULB department, said, “The DPR for DLF phases 1 and 2, Sushant Lok and Palam Vihar has been accepted by the department and forwarded to the town and country planning department for further action. The department is considering the reports of other two colonies and decision will be taken soon.”
 
 Now, the town and country planning department will ask developers to pay the amount, as calculated by the MCG, for pending infrastructure works or get pending work done within six months and obtain occupation certificate before handing over the colonies to the corporation.
 
 If the developers get works completed within the deadline, the town and country planning department will issue completion certificate for the colony and transfer it to the corporation. “If the developers fail to complete the works, the department will recover the amount from them by freezing the deposits or auctioning the property,” said an official. The state government in February 2016 approved the transfer of these upscale private colonies spread in over 3000-acre area, to the MCG.
