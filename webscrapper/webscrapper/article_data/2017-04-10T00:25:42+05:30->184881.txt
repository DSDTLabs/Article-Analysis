MUMBAI: Petrol pump owners have threatened a ‘weekly off’ every Sunday from May 10 if the government doesn’t hike dealer’s commission. They also said they will observe May 10 as “No Purchase Day”. 

 “We had withdrawn the strike threat in January after oil marketing companies assured to revise dealer commission rates. But nothing happened in four months,” said Ravi Shinde of the Petrol Dealers’ Association.
