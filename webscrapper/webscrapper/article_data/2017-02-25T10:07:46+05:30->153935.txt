BERHAMPUR: Most couples in Ganjam district who had contested the three-tier panchayat election have failed to meet with any success. With the exception of one of the six couples, the rural polls proved to be a rocky ride for the rest. 

 The lucky couple is   and his wife Rama. While Rama who contested for the post of a zilla parishad member won from zone 49 (Belaguntha block) as an independent candidate, her husband has been elected as samiti member from Ambapua panchayat in the same block. Rama was elected as the vice chairperson of the Belaguntha panchayat samiti during the last panchayat election in 2012. 
 
 It's pertinent to note that Rama and her husband were suspended from the BJD recently as she was in the fray against the party candidate. "The people of the area have immense faith in us, as we have always stood by them," said a jubilant Rama. 
 
 Manoranjan Dyansamantara, son of senior   leader and former speaker of state Assembly  , was elected as samiti member of Samantarapur panchayat. His wife   lost the election as samiti member from Samantiapalli panchayat in Patrapur block. In the last panchayat election, the couple was elected as samiti member from Tumba (Manoranjan) and Patrapur (Meenu). "We could not devote much time to campaigning this time. It may be one of the reasons for the defeat of my wife," said Manoranjan. 
 
 Similarly, while Y   has been elected as sarpanch from Gudipadara panchayat in Patrapur block, his wife A Sanjukta lost from a panchayat in the same block. Rao was the former sarpanch of Gudipadara, while his wife was elected as the sarpanch from the same panchayat last time.
