Palanpur: Nine-year-old Hiranya Thakor, who was found murdered on Sunday, was cremated at Sardarpur (Chikna) village with hundreds of villagers joining the mourning.

 Police are still hunting for clues about his killers, who had allegedly kidnapped him on December 23 and then dumped his body behind the staffroom of the primary school. Hiranya’s body was found by some children who were playing in the compound on Sunday evening. 
 
 Mehsana superintendent of police, Chaitanya Mandlik, who camped in the village for nearly three hours, said, “We have assured the family and villagers of arresting the assassins at the earliest and of a speedy probe.”
 
 “We will also request the government to set up a special court for the case trial,” he said.
 
 The forensic postmortem conducted in Ahmedabad revealed that Hiranya was smothered to death.
 
 Sources said that police strongly suspect the involvement of a close relative in the murder.
