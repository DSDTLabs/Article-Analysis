KOLKATA: The city’s suburban network may not have received the kind of attention that Mumbai’s or Bengaluru’s in this year’s railway Budget in Parliament, but the ministry seems to have taken cognizance of concerns expressed by officials in Kolkata.

 Rs 20 crore has been allocated this year for a rail flyover near Dum Dum Junction to ease the movement of freight and express trains. The flyover is being constructed at a cost of Rs 136.5 crore. Of this, nearly Rs 100 crore have been spent till the end of 2017.
 
 “Once the flyover is completed, there won’t be as much congestion in that route as goods and long-distance trains can be diverted.   (ER) has now received most of the amount required for the flyover’s construction,” an official said.
 
 Electrification of the   stretch has also been proposed in this year’s railway Budget. Another official said, this is a vital decision as it would help South Eastern Railway in increasing mobility. Once Masagram gets connected to Bowaichandi and  , trains between south India and the northeastern states would also be able to bypass Howrah, thereby reducing congestion.
 
 “We have also received allocation for development of the new terminus at Santragachi. Work for the two-storied station building has already started,” a South Eastern Railway (SER) official said.
