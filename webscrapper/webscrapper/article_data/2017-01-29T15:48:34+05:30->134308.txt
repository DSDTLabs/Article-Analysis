KOZHIKODE: Electricity minister   said that the state government has not abandoned the controversial Athirappilly  .

 Speaking at the interaction meeting organised by   at the KP Kesava Menon hall on Sunday, he said that the controversies created over the project were baseless.
 
 "The state government has received all the required clearances from the central government for the projet. It would be a big loss for the state if the Athrirappilly project is cancelled," the minister said.
 
 The recent moves by the government to revive the proposal for 163 MW hydel power project had resulted in protests from environmental organisations and political parties, including from the CPI, a key ruling LDF ally.
 
 Stating that the power condition in the state was grim on account of the falling water levels in the reservoirs due to the deficient monsoon, he said that KSEB is forced to purchase 70 percent of electricity city from outside the state.
 
 "The government and KSEB are trying to avoid power cuts in the upcoming summer months by purchasing power from wherever available. But we don't have enough lines to transmit the power to the state," the minister said.
 
 Mani said that the government would revive the   and Kuttiyar power project which had been halted during the tenure of the previous UDF government. 
 
 The minister said that KSEB was facing a financial crisis with the debts touching Rs 6000 crore.
 
 "It is the Kerala state electricity regulatory commission which decides on increasing the power tariffs. The government will not be able to brush aside their concerns if they raise the issue of the financial health of KSEB. But we have not received any formal recommendations from the commission regarding revising the power tariffs," he said.
