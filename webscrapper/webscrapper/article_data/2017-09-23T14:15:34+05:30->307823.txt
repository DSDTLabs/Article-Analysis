 is known to be the queen of high brow stoner movies and it seems like she has taken this tag quite seriously.

 Dunst explained that partway through shooting she had a little bit of a rough time smoking 'prop weed'.
 
  
  
  She said, "You know, you have movie pot, which is basically fake. It's whatever they roll. Fake whatever."
 
  Adding, "We were doing this one scene, obviously in the movie I don't smoke that many but when you're doing takes I was smoking one after the next after the next. After we were done with the scene I went back to this little bedroom to rest and I started to feel like I was losing my mind."
 
  After that she called the director, Laura Mulleavy, to say that she needed to go to the hospital.
 
  It was after this episode that one of the producers came to check on   and investigated her pot props, only to find that she had been smoking real pot.
 
  "He came back and he was like 'Oh you smoked a FULL blunt on one of the takes,' and this is like STRONG S**T," he said.
 
  When Kimmel asked how the weed got replaced, the actor said they had locals roll the joints for them and they just threw some real grass in for fun.
 
  "I was like crying, laughing, eating a peanut butter sandwich. I couldn't film anymore. They sent me home. I was a total mess. I've never been that stoned in my entire life," she noted.
 
  'Woodshock' stars Dunst as a young woman named Theresa who, suffering a profound loss, begins to spiral out of control torn between her emotional state and a super strong canabinoid drug that begins to take hold.
