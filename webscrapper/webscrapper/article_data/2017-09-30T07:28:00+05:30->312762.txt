PANCHKULA: After having failed to trace Honeypreet Insan and Aditya Insan, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) claims to have arrested  , the driver-cum-close confidant of dera head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh. He is said to be the most important link which could help police track Honeypreet, Aditya and Pawan Insan. 

 On Friday, SIT also picked up a resident of Shahbad from Kurukshetra for his alleged involvement in mobilizing the crowd for violence in Panchkula. 
 
 Police arrested Rohtash Singh, who had set up a temporary wireless operating control room for the dera followers ahead of August 25, the day Gurmeet was convicted in rape cases. The local district court remanded Rohtash to judicial custody on Friday.
 
 A Sirsa resident, Rakesh had driven the SUV in which the dera head had come to Panchkula. Sources said he joined the team that provoked violence when his escape plan failed but slipped away and later picked up Honeypreet from Sirsa to take her to Rajasthan.
 
 The court on Thursday ordered 10-day police remand for him. SIT, headed by   Mukesh  , had brought him from Sirsa. “He is one of the close confidants of Gurmeet and his arrest is quite significant for us,’’ said DCP Manbir Singh. “Investigations are in progress and we are hopeful of getting more good leads,” he added.
 
 Meanwhile, sources said Rohtash had not only provoked the followers to resort to violence but even set up the control room for operating the wireless system developed by the dera in Panchkula. This control room was set up in Sector 3 under the garb of public addressing system.
