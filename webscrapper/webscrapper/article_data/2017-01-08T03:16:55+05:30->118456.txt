NOIDA/GREATER  :   in Gautam Budh Nagar will remain closed for students upto Class VIII till January 10 due to   weather, officials said. 

 Most schools, which had closed for winter vacation, had planned to resume classes on January 9. However, after an order issued by the district inspector of schools on Saturday, messages have been sent stating that students need not come on Monday & Tuesday.
 
 According to Bheem Singh, district inspector of schools, in compliance with the directions of district magistrate and keeping in view the increasing cold conditions, classes from nursery to VIII will remain closed in all public, CBSE, ICSE and UP board-affiliated schools till January 10.
 
 Principals of some schools in Noida admitted that the order caused problems as they were forced to change their plans at the “last moment”.
 
 “Changing the schedule is not a problem for the school but the issue is about the transporters. They have to be informed early so that the order can be complied with,” said the principal of a private school in Noida.
