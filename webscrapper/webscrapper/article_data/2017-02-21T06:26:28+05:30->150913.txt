MUMBAI: To curb noise pollution in cities, the   (CPCB) has directed traffic police in nine cities--including Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai--to fine vehicle owners who use power, pressure and musical horns and confiscate them. While city activists welcomed the move, they said the watchdog should also have chalked out an action plan against other sources of noise pollution.

 Adirective by the CPCB states that authorities shall ensure that drivers not sound the horn needlessly and not fit or use any horns that give a harsh, shrill, loud or alarming noise.
 
 Other cities to which this applies include Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Lucknow.
 
 The CPCB has said: “No vehicle shall be permitted to have a musical horn. All vehicles, buses, trucks and cars shall not be fitted with power, pressure or musical horns. Such vehicles shall be challaned and such horns shall be got removed by enforcement officer.“
 
 However, anti-noise crusaders feel that the CPCB should have created an action plan for other sources like construction activity too. “The action is suggested, assuming that vehicles are the source of noise pollution but there is no mention of confiscating crackers or construction machinery which is also a great source of noise pollution,“ said  , convener of the  , an NGO.
 
 CPCB has directed that a control room be set up for public grievances.
