KOCHI: The   on Monday granted   to former state police chief TP Senkumar in a case against him for allegedly making a controversial remark along communal lines.

 A case for promoting religious enmity (section 153A of Indian Penal Code) was registered by cyber crime police station at Thiruvananthapuram against the former DGP following the remarks he made in a media interview. 
 
 In the interview he had given after his retirement on June 30, Senkumar was alleged to have stated that Muslim community accounted for 42% of the childbirths in Kerala whereas their population was 27%.
 
 In the petition seeking anticipatory bail, Senkumar said the allegation that he gave an interview to the online media outlet is incorrect. It was only a friendly discussion in which he expressed anxiety regarding the growth of IS in Kerala and also wished that the responsible police officers who are heading the police department in Kerala may take action against growth of IS, Maoists, and other terrorist groups in the initial stage itself.
 
 The   plea further said the statistics mentioned are based on relevant records like Annual Statistics Report 2010 and 2015. The discussion was based on these statistics but the case was registered against him without looking or referring to these statistics, Senkumar said.
 
 No provision of Indian Penal Code, including 153A, was breached by him and he is innocent of the allegations, Senkumar added. 
 
 “Due to some difference of opinion between the petitioner and some of the high ranking police officers while he was in service, the present attempt is made to humiliate the petitioner who has retired as state police chief,” the petition stated. The court has posted the case to Monday for further hearing.
