Madurai: It was an enriching experience for social activist K Hakkim as he got together with 116 others of varied interests, exchanging ideas and thoughts in a novel attempt to get acquainted with each other at the Gandhi Museum hall on Sunday.

 “A never-before moment for me and for all of us,” says Hakkim who files RTIs to make the public more aware of its rights and government schemes. “Activists are more active than before. This was a perfect platform for us to know each other better.”
 
 Like Hakkim, many social activists belonging to different organisations made it a point to gather at the hall, an inspiring result after some of them volunteered to arrange a meeting by sending invites and spreading the news on social media. “This was only to share our ideas and see each other in person. We started the preparation about a month ago,” says Rajan of Vaigai Nathi Makkal Iyakkam.
 
 Among the collectives that met at hall are Thirunagar Pakkam, Makkal Vizhipunnarvu Arakattalai, New Green ways, Food Bank Madurai, Kalam, Madurai Uthavum Uravugal, Makkal Vizhipunarvu Arakattalai, were some of the organisations that participated. “We feel always encouraged when we hear of a fellow social worker having done something for society, and would like to appreciate them personally. But rarely get a chance to do so,” he says
 
 The meet has mix of young and old generations congratulating each other for the work they have done for society. However, most were jubilant that youngsters are truly an inspiration because they showed more enthusiasm than the seasoned campaigners in serving people. “It is encouraging to see youngsters set an example for elders like me to follow. I am happy. It is always good to know that people are more empathetic with others. It is a good sign,” says Subramanian, who while visiting the museum was lucky to attend the gathering.
