CHENNAI: Opposition leader in the   M K   has asked chief minister   to approach Andhra Pradesh chief minister   and get Chennai its share of Krishna water.

 The DMK working president also asked the government to increase the number of daily trips made by mobile water tankers in the city. The cost of water supplied via mobile water tankers must also be reduced, Stalin said in a statement.
 
 According to   officials, the AP government can release Krishna water only when the Kandaleru reservoir attains a storage of at least 13 thousand million cubic feet (tmc). The Kandaleru reservoir currently contains only about 5tmc. “If there is enoughrain August in catchment areas of the Krishna river, the Kandaleru reservoir may have enough water for us to supply to Chennai,” an official said. 
 
 According to an interstate agreement in 1983, AP has to supply 8tmcft of Krishna water to the state between July and October, and a further 4tmcft between January and April. The city received only 1tmcft last year and 3tmcft so far this year. Stalin accused the AIADMK government of not being able to approach the AP government and secure the city’s annual share of water.
 
 As for the mobile tanker supply in the city, Metrowater currently operates 5,000 free trips and 2,000 paid trips daily and sells water at a subsidised rate of Rs 400 for a 6,000-litre load and Rs 600 for a Rs 9,000-litre load. Metrowater had increased the number of daily free trips from 3,000 to 5,000 and reduced daily paid trips from 4,000 to 2,000.
