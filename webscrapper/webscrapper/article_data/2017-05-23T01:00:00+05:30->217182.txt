TV show ' ' is set to embark on a new journey. The mythological drama airing on Colors highlights various aspects of Lord Shani’s life so far and has broken many myths about his existence in our lives. Now viewers will see a new chapter unfold in Shani’s life where he’ll transform from   to   Shani.

 People will witness the drastic, ruthless and unforgiving side of him. As he embarks on this new journey, Shani’s look will also turn dark and powerful. Replete with sharp edges and burnt silver armour, his new costume will signify control over good and evil, flexibility of his mind and strength of his character.
 
 A source from the show informs, “From being the Lord of Justice, the new role of Shani will be more callous and unforgiving. As Shani undergoes this major transition, his new costume will have more darker shades, which will add extra elements of seriousness to his persona as Dandnayak. His new avatar will exude his unquestionable authority and serious attitude that cements his power amongst all the Devas.”
 
 The journey of Shani ( ) becoming the ultimate Dandnayak will begin with him asking his half-brother, Yam ( ) to decide for himself if his mother Sangya ( ) deserves to be punished for all her wrongdoings. But will Shani’s bid to punish Sangya for her misdeeds hurt his own mother Chhaya (Juhi Parmar) as well?
