CHENNAI:   received 632 crore as Goods and   (GST) compensation from the Centre for the period July to October last year. While the state received a compensation of 530 crore for July and August, it received just 102 crore in the subsequent two months. Lower compensation from the Centre for a month means the state, on its own, had generated higher  . 

 At the time of implementing GST, the Centre and states agreed to a formula under which a 14% increase would be calculated under GST regime for each month for the states, based on the 2015-16 comparative revenue. The shortfall experienced in GST collection would be compensated by the Centre.
 
 "As for Tamil Nadu, in the first two months of GST implementation, there were not many festivals due to which the sales were low across the state. Tax revenue was also less and there was a shortfall under GST. Due to this, we received 530 crore for the two months as compensation," said a senior official in the commercial tax department. 
 
 But in the subsequent two months, the tax revenue in Tamil Nadu was better and the shortfall was less. "The trends just before   showed a good increase in tax revenue and this continued till October end," he said.
 
 Being a manufacturing state, there were doubts whether TN would be able to collect the same revenue under GST as under the value-added tax (VAT) regime. But compared to some northern states, TN has done well in GST collection. It also shows that TN is a big consuming state.
