Dadri: A massive fire gutted five shops of scrap dealers at the Kithora road in Dadri on Friday afternoon. The fire started in one shop and quickly spread to other shops. Nobody was hurt as a police team and fire tenders reached the spot and evacuated the people living in the adjoining areas.

 Police said the shops had a lot of plastic and fur objects which easily got fire. “The shop owners had gone to offer Friday prayers in a local mosque when the fire broke out. Some locals saw flames and smoke emanating from a shop. They alerted others and informed the police,” said a police officer.
 
 Three fire tenders with a police team were immediately rushed to the spot. Sujata Singh SP (rural) Noida said the fire was controlled after two hours. “The people were safely rescued and nobody was injured. Primary investigation indicates a short circuit as the cause of the fire,” she said.
 
 The shop owners were later identified as Sabu, Shaukeen, Bhuttu, Lala and Shaukat Ali. They said goods worth several lakhs were destroyed in the fire. The police said they have not received a written complaint in this regard.
