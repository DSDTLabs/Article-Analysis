Actor   is proud to say that he is a 'true Dilliwala' who studied here, had his first affair and breakup here, and also shot his first film and TV show here. Manit made his Bollywood debut with a cameo in 'Band Baaja Baaraat', and later worked in TV shows like 12/24 Karol Bagh. "I can't imagine myself without Delhi. When actors from Delhi start their career, they hardly get to a chance to visit their hometown. Thankfully, however, I've been getting a lot of Delhi-based films and TV shows. I recently completed shooting for a   film based in the city. One of the things I noticed is that the capital has actually become safer in the last few years. Dilli itni bhi buri nahi hai jitna logon ne bana diya hai," says Manit, who was recently here for the promotion of his show ' '.

  
  
 
  The actor adds that though there are a number of TV shows and films shot here, only a few directors have been able to portray the true spirit and culture of Delhi. He says, "I think   describes Delhi wonderfully in his films. His portrayal of Delhi is closest to what the city really is! So many films have been shot in Old Delhi, but most of them stick to the cliches, and fail to bring out the culture of the area. My father had a shop in Old Delhi, and I've seen the place since childhood. That is one place where you will find temples, mosque, gurudwaras and all this makes for a very unique culture and experience, but sadly, only a few filmmakers have been able to focus on that part so far."
