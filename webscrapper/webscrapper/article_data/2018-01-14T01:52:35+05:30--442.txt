NEW DELHI: The   will convene its first meeting on Sunday. The committee will take up the matter of shortening the admission period from six months to three months and also work on strengthening the grievance redressal system. 

 The vice chancellor of the university is scheduled to brief the media on Monday on the admission process for 2018-19. According to sources in the recently constituted admission committee, the status report on 2017-18 admission process is going to be placed at the first meeting on Sunday. 
 
 According to a senior official of the committee, “The committee will also look at various feedback and suggestions the university received with regards to   from different stakeholders, including parents, students and schools, to improve the system.” 
 
 “However the major issue to be taken up this year is to find ways and means to shorten the duration of the admission window. Otherwise it is a long process, starting with the application process for foreign students, which starts in January- February and continuing till July. Which is close to six months and the university is looking at making the process compact and complete it in around three months. Which practically means the admission this year is likley to start from Arpil-end or May and end in July,” added the official. 
 
 There were issues with the online application process last year for the undergraduate admission, which is also likely to come up for discussion during the meeting. The admission committee will also work on the redressal system and “strengthen it further so that aspirants can get prompt response on emails and phones in case of grievances,” said the official.
