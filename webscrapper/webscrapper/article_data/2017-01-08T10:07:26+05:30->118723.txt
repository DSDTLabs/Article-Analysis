BATHINDA: From being a diehard protester who kept the Dalit cause at his heart to becoming a star campaigner for AAP's Punjab election campaign, Dalit icon   has come a long way from that cold, January 5 night in 2006 when he was brutally attacked by six upper-caste men from his village,   in Mansa, as vengeance for bringing the rapists of his daughter to book.
 
 Such was the brutality of the attack that Bant lost both of his limbs and an arm in it.But 11 years on, the man who has been described as “the icon of Dalit resistance“ in Punjab will immerse himself in an electoral fight. Come January 10, Bant will start campaigning for AAP in Punjab's Doaba region, which has the highest concentration of Dalit communities in the state. AAP's organization building head,  , told TOI on Saturday that Bant had been included in the party's list of star campaigners submitted to the  .“He will canvas extensively for the party,“ he said.
 
 Bant first took the stage for AAP at a rally in Kolianwali village, Lambi constituency, on December 28.
 
 “It is a matter of great honour for me that AAP, which is known for its honesty and setting new trends by uplifting even poor people in politics, has made me one of the star campaigners.I will campaign for the party wholeheartedly and will especially focus on Dalits,“ he said.
 
 Bant had joined AAP in Mansa on December 25, amid a controversy over the party also inducting two of his attackers at the same event.
