Noida: The Noida Authority is building another   near the Noida entry gate, despite complaints from commuters that a similar structure at Sector 14A poses a   hazard during the night and fog.

 Minister Mahesh Sharma on Sunday attended a puja to start the construction of the second U-turn, metres ahead of the first DND loop that is used by travellers from Delhi.
 
 Regular travellers and traffic police personnel said the second U-turn, near Sector 15, would increase problem of snarls on both carriageways of the Dadri road, pointing out how traffic coming from the loop caused jams during the peak hours from 8.30am to 11am and 5pm to 7.30pm on weekdays.
 
 While no traffic police officer was willing to go on record, a senior official said Authority hadn’t taken any permission from traffic department before constructing the second U-turn.
 
 “It is being designed to help the residents of Sector 15A. But it will also pose a huge problem for commuters during peak hours. You can see that on a Monday,” said a constable posted at the spot where the U-turn is supposed to come up.
 
 Sources said the residents of Sector 15A had wanted an easy exit for the Dadri main road that would connect them with the Expressway when the cuts are closed during peak hours and had appealed to Sharma, who stays in the same sector. The MP’s representative, Sanjay Bali, said the proposal had been put up by Sector 15A RWA a year ago. The Authority is spending Rs 48 lakh for the U-turn .
 
 Sandeep Chandra, in charge of Noida traffic cell, said vehicles approaching from DND and Sector 15A would be segregated with help of lane barrier and illuminators so that traffic coming from DND does not merge.
 
 SP (traffic) Anil Jha said the Authority has to see when the two cuts between the central verge and the red lights will be closed.
