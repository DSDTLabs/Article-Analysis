Rajkot: A village sarpanch has helped blow the lid off a gruesome double murder of a man and his mother at a village of Morbi district.

 On Wednesday, Halvad police arrested Vasram Koli’s wife and his nephew, who executed the killings on January 5 and also set the bodies ablaze to destroy the evidence. 
 
 Koli’s wife Hira (30) was in an illicit relationship with his 25-year-old nephew Dinesh in Mansar village. “When Koli came home on January 5, he caught Dinesh and Hira in a compromising position. A heated altercation followed and Dinesh picked up a spade and clobbered Vasram to death in the farm,” said an official of Halvad police station. Later, Dinesh also smothered Vasram’s 60-year-old mother Balu Koli as she has seen him killing Koli.
 
 After the murder, Dinesh and Hira carried the deceased’s bodies to Koparani village of Halvad taluka in a car and set them afire. The duo stayed put in Koparani village for a couple of days.
 
 “As there was no news from either Dinesh or Hira and Koli and his mother remained untraceable, Mansar village sarpanch Sanjay Gohil (40) got suspicious and carried out an independent probe into the case. Gohil found out about the illicit relationship between Dinesh and Hira and approached us with a complaint following which we detained the duo for questioning,” said police.
 
 During preliminary interrogation, Dinesh confessed to killing Koli and his mother. Koli and Hira have a daughter who studies in class VII and son who is in class III. Both the children had gone to school on the fateful day.
