SHIMLA: Asked by the speaker to wind up his speech during discussion on budget, Congress’s Kinnaur   Jagat Singh walked out from the Himachal Pradesh assembly on Tuesday. Other   legislators also followed Negi the moment he left the House. However, the speaker ruled that the walkout would be considered by one member only.

 While participating in the budget debate, Negi took more time to speak than was allotted to him and when Bindal asked him to conclude, former chief minister Virbhadra Singh requested that he (Negi) be given more time. On this, Bindal said Virbhadra was a senior member of the House and that he would be given time when he wants to speak but Negi had already taken lot of time. 
 
 When Speaker asked Negi to either conclude or he would invite another member to speak, the latter staged a walkout. Earlier, Negi had raised the issue of the Kinnaur deputy commissioner being appointed as the chairman of Local Area Development Authority (LADA). He also slammed the budget presented by chief minister Jai Ram  , saying the people had high hopes from the new government. He said the government had failed in financial management and gave no roadmap to come out of the debt trap.
 
 Dalhousie MLA Asha Kumari raised the issue of Thakur’s absence during the discussion. She said neither the CM nor his chief secretary was present in the House.
