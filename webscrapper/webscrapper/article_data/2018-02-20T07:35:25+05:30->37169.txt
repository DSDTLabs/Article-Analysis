BATHINDA: To mark 50 days of their protest against the shutdown of Guru Nanak Dev  , Bathinda, its contractual workers, with the support from farm unions, labourers and government employees, held a rally outside the   administrative complex and organized a march in the town. 

 The contractual employees accused the Punjab government of not making substitute arrangements for them before closing down the plant on January 1. They also accused the state government of not putting in black and white how all 635 contractual employees would be accommodated despite giving verbal assurances on January 27. 
 
 Thermal plant contract workers' coordination committee convener   said, "In a meeting on January 27, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had assured to adjust us on contract basis. We were told soon a written agreement will be made but we are still waiting for that." When contacted, GNDTP general manager   said the PSPCL management was working out details.
