MUMBAI: A seven-member board from BMC-run  , Parel, on Saturday examined the 21-year-old pregnant woman who has petitioned the SC seeking permission to abort her malformed foetus.

 The woman, who is over  , found out in an ultrasound scan a couple of weeks ago that the foetus had a condition called renal agenesis with both the kidneys absent.
 
 It is learnt that the KEM board called a specialist from the hospital’s birth defect clinic for an opinion. This clinic was set up three years ago to rectify anomalies in children soon after birth. It comprises a pediatrician, pediatric surgeon, cardiac surgeon as well as other super specialists.
 
 KEM Hospital dean Dr Avinash Supe said the birth defect clinic’s opinion was included in the assessment report. He said the woman and her relatives came on Saturday for the assessment. “We have sent the report to the SC,” said Dr Supe.
 
 The woman, a housewife from Navi Mumbai, met gynaecologist Dr Nikhil Datar after the scans showed the anomaly. “While the absence of kidneys can be detected in the 17th or 18th week during routine ultrasound scans, the patient’s scans got delayed,” he said. As a result, the renal agenesis could be spotted only after the 20-week time limit for   set in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971.
 
 The patient and Datar then jointly moved the SC on Thursday. The next hearing is scheduled on Tuesday.
