BENGALURU: Social media’s seamier side, its disruptive potential and lack of depth were unravelled at a talk delivered by Prof   from the School of  , University of Texas, here on Friday.

 “Digital tools may connect people, but they can’t create solidarity among people to take risks,”   said, explaining how   can only share information but cannot create solidarity. The talk — Is social media a threat to democracy? — was delivered at the Media Watch public lecture organized by Indian Institute of Journalism &  . 
 
 “If you ask whether social media is a threat to democracy, I don’t have an answer. But social media tools are ripping apart the social fabric. Face-to-face communication is essential to democracy,” he felt. 
 
 Prof   said humans are ‘meaning-seeking’ and ‘story-telling animals’. “We are always creating systems of meaning. We are story-telling animals with a sophisticated communication system. But social media takes us to places that humans are not evolved to deal with,” he said, adding that social media, however, is a reflection of the socio, political, economic system we live in. 
 
 “As social media becomes a modern-day political tool, it’s our responsibility to break that weaponization and understand whether it’s enhancing or replacing face-to-face dialogue,” he said. “People in power will take note of civil movements if those involved are willing to take risks for what they stand for. It’s not always about numbers,” he said to a question on how civic media fosters civic activism. 
 
 On ‘#Metoo’
 
 Asked about his reaction to the #Metoo campaign, Prof Jensen, who’s also a radical feminist, said ‘#Metoo’ was an incredible intervention and a campaign that challenged men.
