Internet is abuzz that   will be seen sporting five different looks in Shankar’s  . The latest, we hear, is that   will be playing the role of a dwarf in the film, and that his character will have different shades.
Interestingly, some time ago, CT did an exclusive write-up from the first day’s shoot of 2.0, where we spotted many dwarfs who had been roped in for that particular scene. We had also seen scientist Vaseegaran (Rajini’s character in the film) sitting along with these dwarfs, inside his lab. And now, it will be interesting to see   himself playing the role of a dwarf. A source also adds that   will be sporting around twelve different looks in the film, and for each role, he is following a different diet to fit into the character.
