SHIMLA: Days before the announcement of assembly election in HP, chief minister   has announced the candidature of his son  , state youth Congress president as the next probable candidate from   constituency. 

 Virbhadra’s announcement has increased political heat as people are wondering from where he himself would contest after giving up his own seat to launch the political career of his son. The party has already announced to contest assembly elections under the leadership of Virbhadra Singh.
 
 Sources said it is not the announcement of launching his son that has left many party leaders in uncomfortable position but the announcement of chief minister to contest from different seat. If Congress wins the coming election, then Singh is set to become the chief minister for the seventh term, they said.
 
 Revealing his intention to field his son, Singh while addressing a gathering of employees of Shimla Rural constituency and office bearers of party at his official residence Oak Over, said, that he himself wishes to contest from a seat from where Congress has never won. He, however, said it depends on the people of the state. 
 
 “I have got plenty of love from the people of Shimla Rural seat, as I got from my own traditional home constituency,” he said. He said people should not think that he was leaving   as he would be present there and people would have two MLAs instead.
