MYSURU: Sri Chamundeshwari Temple atop Chamundi Hills is racing ahead to become one of the highest   in the state. As against Rs 18.33 crore   in 2014-15 and Rs 21.74 crore in 2015-16, the income of the temple has jumped to Rs 24.09 crore in 2016-17.

 With around 2,000 devotees visiting the hill shrine every day — the footfall rises to about 5,000 during holidays — to have the darshan of the goddess Chamundeshwari, the temple has seen a rise in its revenue. It has earned Rs 9.17 crore from hundis. The revenue through the special entrance fee has risen from Rs 1.95 crore in 2014-15 to Rs 2.41 crore in 2016-17. But the income through the general entrance fee, which is Rs 4.24 crore, has not seen much difference for the past two years.
 
 As the temple also sells a good number of laddus ( ) to devotees, it has fetched Rs 2.75 crore. It has also been able to garner Rs 1.13 crore from various sevas: Rs 1.16 crore from donations for dasohas, Rs 49.92 lakh from interest from various banks, Rs 7.10 lakh from e-seva and others sources.
 
 As movie producers of many languages prefer to shoot atop Chamundi Hills, the muzrai department collects Rs 35,000 for the shoots and this is said to have added to the revenue. The number of devotees offering saris to goddess Chamudeshwari has increased. The temple which earned Rs 47.53 lakh in 2014-15 by auctioning the saris, has generated Rs 1.49 crore in 2016-17.
 
 The temple could also generate revenue from donations through money orders and demand drafts, rent from guesthouse and halls, Sankasta Hara seva and others.
 
 Of the donations, Rs 3.5 lakh was in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 (demonetized currency notes). After the bank did not accept old notes, the temple authorities are possessing the scrapped currencies. 
 
 
 
 
 Apart from donations, the temple also received offerings in the form of rice from devotees. It has received 87,510 kg of rice in 2016-17. The temple authorities have decided not to purchase rice for anna dasoha (mass-feeding) service this year.
 
 
 
 
 TVS Motor Company has given a battery-operated vehicle to ferry senior citizens and physically challenged persons between the bus stand and the temple. The temple has increased the duration of its anna dasoha from 12.30pm to 3.30pm (It was from 12.30pm to 2pm earlier).
 
 To enable devotees have hassle-free darshan, the temple has introduced swiping machines (PoS machines) to purchase tickets for special darshan and seva tickets (using debit or credit cards).
 
 Sri Chamundeshwari Temple executive officer Prasad told TOI that various development works have been taken to facilitate devotees, and they have led to the rise in the number of devotees.
