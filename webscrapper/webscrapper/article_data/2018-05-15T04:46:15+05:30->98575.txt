NEW DELHI: With the   assembly polls out of the way, the Centre finally met the much deferred deadline and submitted the   to the   on Monday for implementing the court's February 16 judgment allocating river water to Karnataka,  , Kerala and Puducherry.

 
 Attorney general K K Venugopal submitted the scheme but said the Centre had left the christening of the body set up to supervise   water sharing to the apex court. "The name of the authority is a very sensitive issue in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The guidance and direction of the SC is therefore sought as far as name of the authority is concerned," the AG said. Water resources secretary U P Singh was also present in court.
 
 The deadline for framing the scheme had ended on March 31, but the Centre delayed submitting the scheme to the SC, with political circles viewing the procrastination as deliberate and reflective of the BJP leadership's reluctance to annoy the electorate in Karnataka which has feuded with neighbouring Tamil Nadu over Cauvery waters.
 
 A bench of CJI Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud on Monday said the court would not go into another round of litigation over the legality of Cauvery scheme framed by the Centre. "We will only examine whether the scheme is in conformity with our judgment or not," the CJI said. The bench invited views from the four states and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday.
 
 The draft scheme talked about setting up of an authority, which would frame guidelines for sharing river water.
