LUCKNOW: Days after CPM general secretary   said opposition parties may consider moving an impeachment motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra,   MP   said he was not in favour of such a move.

 Referring to the crisis triggered by the SC’s four most senior judges questioning the CJI’s functioning at a press conference two weeks ago, the SP general secretary said it was an internal matter of the judiciary and should be resolved by the judges. The four judges had alleged the CJI “selectively” assigned sensitive cases to “preferred benches”. 
 
 On Tuesday, Yechury said opposition parties had started discussions on the crisis in the SC, adding that they may consider moving an impeachment motion against the CJI. 
 
 “I don’t support any such move. It is an internal matter of the judiciary and must be resolved by the judges themselves,”   said in a telephonic conversation with TOI on Saturday.
 
 Agarwal wondered why political parties should take it upon themselves to talk about impeachment when the four SC judges had only brought the issue before the people and not even talked of any move against the CJI.
