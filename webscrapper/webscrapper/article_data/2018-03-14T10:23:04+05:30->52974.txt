PATNA: Tourists can expect a more comfortable journey with the   (BSTDC) planning to use its idle double decker bus on   route. The bus will also carry tourists to Sonepur and   in  .

 The double decker bus, launched in 2016 under   scheme of BSTDC, is lying idle along with several other buses at the corporation’s office near R Block here. The unused buses of BSTDC include a Volvo and three air conditioned buses. The AC buses of BSTDC usually ply on Patna-Ranchi and Patna-Purnia routes.
 
 BSTDC managing director Inayat Khan said while four Volvo buses were still operational, the rest of the non-functional buses had run their course. “We are planning to replace these buses. The matter will be discussed in the next meeting of the corporation,” Khan said.
 
 Another BSTDC official said some parts of the buses required replacement, but it was not feasible to keep spending money for the repair. “These parts are brought from Punjab. Hence, replacing the buses is the better option,” he said.
 
 The double decker bus service had to be stopped due to risk of accident owing to overhead wires in the city. 
 
 BSTDC MD Khan said while major thoroughfares did not pose problems in running the double decker bus, it was not feasible to run the bus in the city’s interiors due to the low lying electricity wires. “The wires made it unsafe for the passengers to sit atop the bus’s open roof seating area,” Khan said.
 
 Initially, the tourism department had planned to buy two double decker buses, but managed to acquire just one. The bus, which was being operated in the state capital under Patna Darshan programme, was later shifted to Rajgir. However, the bus could not operate there as well owing to overhead wires and other obstructions.
