NAGPUR: Two-time age category World Champion and Women Grandmaster ( ) Cori Deysi avenged her drawn game at Montcada with a fluent win over   in their third round contest of the   at Catalonia, Spain, on Friday.

 City's only International Master (IM) made a mid-game blunder to once again fail with the white pieces and lose a point in the third round of the nine-day XL Open International Barbera del Valles chess tournament. 
 
 The 60-move battle on the 10th board saw Deshmukh had a positive start with the Reeti opening but the 50-year-old played a wrong move with his pawn. The WGM from Peru was smart enough to capitalize that mistake and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.
 
 "I just gifted Deysi the point," a dejected Deshmukh told TOI from Spain.
 
 He added, "In fact it should have been a crushing victory for me as till the 30th move I was heading towards gaining full point. Two moves later I made a blunder with my pawn on e2. Realizing my mistake I started playing passively."
 
 On how he managed to stretch the game, Deshmukh said, "She came in severe time pressure as against mine. But I was low on confidence and here I again made a mistake when I played my queen for rook. I kept on fighting but lost the interesting contest after 60 moves."
 
 In the 4th round, Deshmukh will defend with the black pieces against Kolhapur's   on the 25th board.
