NAGPUR: After the latest order of 250 aircraft placed in 2014,   will be getting delivery of a new aircraft every nine days till 2027.

 Summing up all the acquisitions since 2005, the airlines’ fleet will reach 530 in all, said Rahul Bhatia, founder and group managing director of Interglobe Aviation, which operates the Indigo brand of airlines.
 
 Bhatia, who was addressing a convocation meet at   ( ), 35km from the city, said Indigo began with 100 aircraft in 2005. At that time, other players in the industry thought it was a suicidal move. “The industry was of the view that Indigo was a late entrant in the business and starting with a huge acquisition of 100 aircraft would be a disaster. This was the biggest acquisition in the history of commercial aviation,” he said.
 
 “The decision paid off. Soon, order books of both Boeing and Airbus were bursting at seams. Rapid deliveries, on the other hand, gave Indigo the chance to jump the queue in the market,” said Bhatia.
 
 “After acquiring 100 A320 aircraft in 2005, an order of 180 A320 NEO family planes was placed in 2011, followed by 250 in 2014,. The deliveries will continue till 2027,” he said. 
 
 It took more than two years for Indigo to fly after it got approval from the Indian government. However, the company knew that the opportunity in Indian skies was not running away.
 
 Kamal Nath, IMT president and Congress MP from Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh, asked the passing out management graduates to gear up for the changing world order. “There is a new wave of nationalism taking over the world. This may initially seem irrelevant for a business graduate. However, the new government in the US is likely to have a severe impact on the Indian IT industry,” said Nath.
 
 “Globalization which used to be the buzzword so far is now being replaced by nationalization. The countries which were champions of globalization are now the champions of nationalism. Examples like Trump, Brexit and the extended win of right-wing parties show the growth of nationalist protectionism in the world,” said Nath.
 
 IMT director Subhajit Bhattachjaryya said, “The highest pay package bagged by an IMT student in the 2017 campus selection stands at Rs17 lakh per annum. This is higher by Rs2 lakh as compared to the peak package of last year. The average package offered to the students has gone up by Rs50,000 at Rs7.5 lakh a year in 2017.”
 
 This year, 278 students got campus offers as against 360 in all. More offers are expected in the coming month,” he said.
