Mumbai: The bhoomipujan of the much-delayed   chawl redevelopment will be done in the next fortnight. Replying to a query in the legislative assembly, minister of state for housing Ravindra Waikar said on Saturday that the government has awarded bids for the redevelopment projects. The state has chosen Larsen & Toubro to redevelop the BDD chawls at Naigaon in Dadar, and Shapoorji Pallonji Group for the ones at NM Joshi Marg in Lower Parel.

 Waikar said tenders have been called for Worli BDD chawls and work on that project too will start soon. “We will give the residents 500 sqft houses and work on the project will begin soon. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis will inaugurate the project in about two weeks’ time,” said Waikar, while replying to a question raised over Mhada and SRA projects in the city.
 
 The BDD chawls were developed by the British in the 1920s as a low-cost housing solution. There are 207 such chawls spread across about 37 hectare in four areas—Worli, Sewri, NM Joshi Marg and Naigaon. There are a total of 12,327 families living in these British-era buildings in 160sqft houses. The redevelopment of these chawls will also create one of the largest stocks of low-cost houses—3,000 units.
 
 Waikar also said that the state government was mulling reducing the mandatory consent of 70% residents for undertaking SRA projects to 51% so that work is expedited.
 
 “There is a lot of delay in getting consent of slumdwellers as some people try to influence them to hold on to their consent. These things delay projects and so, the government is considering reducing the number of consents required,” he said.
