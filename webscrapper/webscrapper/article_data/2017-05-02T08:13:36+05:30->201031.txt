HYDERABAD: Former Union minister and Congress MP   on Monday called upon farmers to send parcels of   through courier to chief minister   and Prime Minister   so that they would come to their rescue at least after being bitten by the pungency of mirchi.

 “Please do not burn the chilli which you have produced with your blood, sweat and tears. You send them to the CM and PM. Even I will send a kilo each through courier to them,” she told farmers.
 
 She blasted the ruling TRS for spending almost Rs 500 crore on the party plenary and public meeting, but not coming forward to spend even Rs 100 crore to extend remunerative price to chilli farmers.
 
 Farmers understand if the crop suffers damage due to drought or floods, but here that state government itself had advised them not to plant cotton. “Now, when the farmers went for chilli and got a bumper crop, the government has no money to come to their rescue. The chief minister must take responsibility. Over 100 farmers in   alone have killed themselves due to debts,” she said.
