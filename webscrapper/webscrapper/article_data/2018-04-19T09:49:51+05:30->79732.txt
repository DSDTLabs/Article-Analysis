LUCKNOW: A man allegedly committed suicide by jumping in front of a train in   area late on Tuesday night. The family of the deceased claimed he had ended his life because he could not withstand “police torture”.

 The deceased,   (50), was rounded up after his son Azhar was accused of kidnapping his neighbour   Asif’s daughter. The case was registered on April 14. A team led by sub-inspector   reached Azhar’s house but picked Mohammed when Azhar could not be traced.
 
 The family now demands action against the investigation officer. Police denied the allegations and said the victim was called to the police station as per norm.
 
 “He was rounded up by police on April 15 and April
 
 16. Police tortured him to extract information on Azhar and the girl. However, he did not know anything,” said a family member in a complaint to senior officials.
 
 Alleging ‘barbaric torture’ by police, the family said in a written statement, “He was shaking when he reached home after his release from the police station.”
 
 They also claimed Mohammed left the house on Tuesday night to report to the police.
 
 “He jumped before a train fearing police interrogation,” his family alleged.
 
 ASP (west) Vikas   said Mohammed was not subjected to any physical torture.
 
 “He was only called for questioning. He also said efforts were on to recover Azhar and the girl. Let the autopsy report come,” he said.
