CHENNAI: Demanding cancellation of public hearing to implement the draft coastal zone management plan, fishermen from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur staged a protest in front of the Chennai collectorate on Wednesday. 

  president   said the plan did not include the traditional rights of fishermen. Already the National Green Tribunal ordered the coastal zone management authorities to demarcate the hazard line in an order issued on December last year. This was also not marked in the draft plan.
 
 Fishing villages, common properties of fishermen, community infrastructures, housing facilities for fishermen have to be marked for the use of local administration along with survey numbers. But, the draft map did not have any details about all these, he said.
 
 The new draft plan should have been based on the 1996 coastal zone management plan, which was approved by the central government. But, this was not followed, he said.
