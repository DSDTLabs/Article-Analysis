NEW DELHI: A man was   by four men for allegedly stealing machinery parts from a factory in outer Delhi’s Ranhola on Wednesday afternoon.

 Two of the four accused, meanwhile, have been arrested and cops are on the lookout for the other two.
 
 “The victim, Ranbir, was beaten up and left unconscious. He was later taken to a hospital where he was declared brought dead,” said DCP (outer) Mahendra Nath Tiwari.
 
 Owner of the factory, Sudhir, had earlier lodged a police complaint that expensive components of a machine in his factory had been stolen. The parts were reportedly worth Rs 5 lakh.
 
 On the basis of that complaint, police apprehended a factory’s worker called Guddu. During interrogation, he confessed to stealing the parts. He told cops that Ranbir was also involved in the crime and had been selling the stolen parts in the market.
 
 After getting information from the cops, the factory workers started interrogating Ranbir on their own. When he refused to accept the allegations, four men, two of which have been identified as Lokendra and Sachin, tied him to a pole and started beating him up, forcing him to confess to his crime.
 
 After the assault, Ranbir was left unconscious. When police reached the factory and inquired about Ranbir, Sachin and Lokendra tried to escape but were apprehended. Ranbir’s body was recovered from a room in the factory.
