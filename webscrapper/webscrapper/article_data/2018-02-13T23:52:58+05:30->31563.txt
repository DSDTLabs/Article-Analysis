 “The song, High On Love, is a pure romantic number — a melody with a western touch. The situation involves a boy falling in love after he comes across a girl, and singing as someone who realises he is head over heels in love with her. It has been written by Bharathiyar’s grandson, Niranjan Bharathi, and sung by Sid Sriram. This is the first time Sid is singing for Yuvan and that makes it all the more special,” says Elan.
