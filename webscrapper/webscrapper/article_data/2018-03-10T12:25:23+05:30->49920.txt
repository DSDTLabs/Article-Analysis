TIRUPUR: More than 100 residents from  , Ayyan Nagar and Chella Nagar in the city on Friday submitted a petition to the HR&CE assistant commissioner S V Harshini requesting her not to force them to vacate their houses.

 Recently, the HR&CE board had issued notices to encroachers at KVR Nagar and   areas to vacate the land belonging to the department. According to HR&CE officials, nearly 12 acres belonging to the department have been encroached in these two areas. 
 
  south MLA S Gunasekaran accompanied the residents to submit the petition. According to HR& CE sources, Tirupur’s Visveswara Veeraraghava Perumal temple owns 3.75 acres at KVR Nagar and 3.08 acres at Karuvampalayam and its surrounding areas. 
 
 Similarly, 4.31 acres in the same locality near Mangalam Road belonged to   temple, Nallur. Patta or sale deeds of all the properties are in the name of the respective temples till date, sources said.
 
 The board has identified more than 145 houses and commercial establishments being encroached on those lands for more than four decades. So, the executive officers of the temples have issued show cause notices to the encroachers.
 
 “We have identified the encroachers and gave them two choices; they should either vacate the land or should be ready to pay land rentals to the board. But so far, no one including a commercial establishment, which alone had encroached 1.33 acres, was ready to follow it,” said a HR&CE official.
 
 J Kathirvel, one of the petitioners, said, “All these lands were bought from different parties over the years and the lands’ ownerships were changed to many hands in many cases.” 
 
 “But now, the HR&CE has issued show cause notices claiming that the lands belonged to the board. It is unfair to force us to vacate as we will lose our livelihoods,” he added.
