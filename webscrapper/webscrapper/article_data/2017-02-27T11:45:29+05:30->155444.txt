DUBAI:   uses a court like an interior decorator, accessorizing it artfully, picking angles and lines, littering the space with winners.

 Consistency may not be her thing yet, but her craft is punishing.   was at the receiving end of the firepower in the final of the Dubai Duty Free   championships on Saturday night, where the 22year-old from Ukraine claimed her biggest prize yet, a 6-4, 6-2 win in a raindelayed affair.
 
 Svitolina, who came into the final having won five titles, including one earlier this month, all of which being international series events, took home $487,245 and 900 ranking points for her first   win.
 
 The 5'9'' tall Odessaborn Svitolina, who closed the exchange with a winner that clipped the line, will debut in the topten of the world rankings at No. 10 when the new list comes out on Monday.
