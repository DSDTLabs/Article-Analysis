JAIPUR: After Uttar Pradesh began shutting down illegal slaughterhouses, various saints, ‘mahants’ (priests) and other religious leaders have called for a ‘Dharam Sansad’ on Thursday to discuss such illegal abattoirs functioning within the city.

 The ‘sansad’ will chalk out a strategy to hold protests on the issue and demand that the   (JMC) take action against illegal slaughterhouses from April 1.
 
 More than 24 religious leaders, including saints and ‘mahants’, will gather at the   at Badi Chaupar in the city for the ‘Dharam Sansad’ which will also discuss the issue of constructing the Ram Temple in Ayodhya.
 
 When asked if they were against selling meat in the city,  , convener of ‘Dharam Sansad’, said, “We are not against it. But I can show you examples where meat shops are being run in front of temples or near temples in the city. We are against such shops. Likewise, if JMC has not renewed the licences of slaughterhouses in the city, they should clarify if those which are operating now are legal or illegal. If they are illegal, why can’t they be shut?”
 
 The meeting will pass a resolution and submit a memorandum to chief minister   and city mayor Ashok Lahoty.
 
 Rajasthan   representatives will also join the discussion to chalk out a result-oriented strategy in this regard.
 
 “If the government does not take action against illegal slaughterhouses, the public will come out to the streets. This will become a mass protest,” said a representative of Rajasthan Jain Sabha.
