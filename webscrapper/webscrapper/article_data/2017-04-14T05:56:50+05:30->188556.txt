BENGALURU: Ram Singh (name changed) has never consumed tobacco in any form but is suffering from mouth cancer. After a year of battling the disease, the city-based businessman is getting better, thanks to the inclusion of integrated medicine in his treatment. 

 Singh underwent radiation therapy for six weeks, before taking ayurvedic and homeopathic medicines under the care of Dr  , integrated medicine expert, and founder of  .
 
 “In a lot of cases, we provide patients with integrated medicine. I won’t say we have cured cancer, but along with radiotherapy and chemotherapy, alternative medicine is prescribed for effective pain management. An ayurvedic mouthwash improved Singh’s condition. We also gave him salivation drugs,” said Dr Mathai.
 
 HCG, a leading hospital in cancer care, has an integrated medicine wing. In-house naturopathy doctors and yoga practitioners help patients combat the side-effects of radiation and chemotherapy. “We get over 25-30 referrals a week. We work on stabilizing the patient, controlling nausea and vomiting, and pain management. Each case is discussed with the oncologist,” says Dr  , senior scientist, integrated approach to cancer care, HCG.
 
 In a significant move, the Karnataka government is launching an ayurveda clinic for cancer cure at Kidwai Insitute of Oncology, the lone government-run cancer care centre in the state, on Monday. Dr  , director of Kidwai hospital, said efforts to integrate various schools of medicine in cancer treatment have to begin. Over 25 years ago, Kidwai housed an ayurveda unit but it didn’t run for long, he said.
