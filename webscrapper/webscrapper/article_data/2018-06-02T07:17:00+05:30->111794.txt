Amritsar: Akal Takht jathedar Giani Gurbachan Singh has appealed to the Sikh masses to peacefully observe ‘Ghallughara Diwas’ on June 6. While talking to newspersons here on Friday, the jathedar said no one would be allowed to create nuisance or disturb the scheduled programme at the Akal Takht.

 He said the sangat (community) should come to Akal Takht in large numbers and listen to gurbani on the occasion. The jathedar also asked the Amritsar district administration to make arrangements to maintain law and order in the city. “If any untoward incident happens, the district administration will be responsible for it,” he said, adding that no one would be allowed to violate maryada (religious code).
 
 Singh also directed the sangat to not raise any slogans in presence of Guru Granth Sahib. In reply to a question about Narain Das, who had allegedly made objectionable utterings against Sikh gurus, the jathedar said Narain couldn’t be pardoned.
 
 e asked the Sikh bodies to send suggestions to prevent such incidents in future. The jathedar said that the Akal Takht secretariat had only received an e-mail from Narain seeking apology.
 
 Meanwhile, informal Sarbat Khalsa-appointed jathedar of Takht Damdama Sahib, Baljit Singh Daduwal, said that the parallel jathedar of Akal Takht, Dhian Singh Mand, could give message to the Panth from Bargari where they had laid a ‘morcha’ against the persons responsible for desecration and theft of saroop of Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari and Burj Jawahar Singh Wala respectively.
 
 In wake of any untoward incident during the ‘Ghallughara week,’ the Amritsar deputy commissioner Kamaldeep Singh Sangha has invoked Section 144 (banning assmebly of five or more persons) of CrPC in the district. He has directed people not to carry any licenced weapons, explosive, sharp-edged weapons. The directions would remain in force from June 1 till further orders.
