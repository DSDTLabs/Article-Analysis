KOLHAPUR: The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna ( ) and the   (BJP) will only come together to contest the zilla parishad ( ) and   elections in the Kolhapur South assembly segment.

 Repeated discussions were held between Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna (SSS) leader Raju Shetti and Chandrakant Patil from the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) over the seat-sharing formula. Finally, it was decided that the two parties would form an alliance for the Kolhapur South assembly segment. Shetti’s party has released a list of 23 candidates for ZP polls.
 
 Party workers were also pressuring Shetti to contest alone for the election to show the party’s presence in the district.
 
 The party will contest all seven seats from the Shirol taluka, one seat each from Bhudargad, two seats each from Radhanagari and Shahuwadi taluka, four from Panhala and five from Hatkanangale taluka. The party has a strong following in the Chandgad and Gaganbawada talukas, but has not fielded any candidates from these talukas.
 
 After the BJP formed an alliance with Vinay Kore’s Jansurajya Party, Shetti had stated that he will go it alone for the election. After a meeting between Kore, Shetti and Patil it was expected that Shetti will go along with the BJP. But, the seat-sharing issue coupled with SSS party workers’ demand to contest solo led to not forming the alliance. The BJP had already declared its candidates from Shirol taluka, where SSS has strong presence.
 
 In the Kolhapur South assembly segment, BJP MLA Amal Mahadik and SSS district president Bhagwan Kate unanimously declared that they have formed an alliance for the Panchayat Samiti elections. The SSS will contest one seat and support the BJP, which is contesting all remaining seats of the Panchayat Samiti. SSS leader Bhagwan Kate stated that his party will support BJP for both ZP and Panchayat Samiti elections.
