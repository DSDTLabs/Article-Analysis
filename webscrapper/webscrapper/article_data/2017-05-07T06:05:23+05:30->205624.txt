NASHIK: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will soon start the   for the 17th century   

 Earlier, chemical conservation work had been done before the Kumbh Mela but as the vegetation weakened the structure, conservation of it has become crucial. The work will be done in phases.
 
 Constructed in 1756 (BC 1678) by Sardar of Peshwas, Gangadhar Yashwant Chandrachud, Sundarnarayan temple is one of the most frequented temples by tourists and locals.
 
 In July 2015, the Aurangabad unit of ASI had started chemical conservation work but halted it soon due to the cracks in the stones of the temple. The ASI’s chemology branch in Aurangabad then sought permission for structural conservation. The stones have cracks in them and may loosen or give away in a couple of years. 
 
 “Removing the vegetation and chemically conserving the temple was not sufficient as there were cracks in the stones. In September 2015, the state archaeology department wrote to its head office for structural conservation,” an official said.
 
 Currently, administrative approval of Rs 4.51 crore and financial approval of Rs 2.50 crore has been given for the conservation. “We will soon start with the first phase of the conservation. The superstructure (dome) will be dismantled step by step,” said assistant director of the department of archaeology, Maharashtra,  . 
 
 The superstructure is around 50-55 feet in height and needs  . “There will be no difference in the size,” Gharpure said.
 
 The decoration, art work, floral parts, carvings of gods and goddesses will be prepared in the same manner like the original one. “The conservation work will take about two years to finish. The raw material and stone will be brought from Degluler, Nanded and the lime from Gujarat. We are using the same basalt stone which was originally used,” Gharpure said.
