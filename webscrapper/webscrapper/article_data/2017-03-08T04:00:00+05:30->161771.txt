Surat: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Ashish Khetan visited city on Tuesday and claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi disappointed residents of Surat by not making any announcement for development of airport. Khetan was here to participate in a party workers’ meeting over upcoming assembly election. Khetan said, “Surat earns so much of foreign exchange through its well established economy but the government is yet to develop its airport. Even smaller cities than Surat has better airport and air connectivity in country.” “It would have been a good news for people of Surat if PM had made some announcements related to development of the airport during his speech at the airport on Tuesday. There is not enough air connectivity to the city and it is proving as a major hindrance to growth,” Khetan added. He also claimed that the Gujarat chief minister is operated by BJP national president Amit Shah with a remote.
