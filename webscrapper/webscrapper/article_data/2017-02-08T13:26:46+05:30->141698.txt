Actress   has defended her friend and singer  , saying it is "so hard" for young women to date in the spotlight. 

  
  
 During a Monday appearance on 'The  ', the 30-year-old Girls creator backed her close friend, lamenting the perils of dating in the spotlight,."It's so hard. I think about the relationships that I had in my early twenties and if they had been public, it would've been a disaster," Dunham said. 
 
 Swift, 27, split from actor   last fall after three months of dating. Before that, Swift dated Scottish DJ   for 15 months before calling it quits. 
 
 "I mean, not to repeat age-old feminist points, but it's like, you know, any male actor her age who's going out and dating is applauded," Dunham continued "To just have a perfectly normal amount of romantic partners but be held to impossibly high standards by the press. Like, it's just an unfair and unwinnable game."
