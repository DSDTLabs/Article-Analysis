MUMBAI: After a series of HSC question paper leaks in the past week, board officials are finally taking note of the use of   during exams.

 While their use was restricted for anyone on the premises, except for the custodian and exam conductor, the rule was seldom followed by supervisors and students.
 
 However, now the board’s Mumbai division has instructed its specially-created flying squads to keep an eye on the use of phones in exam halls. “Since the papers are being circulated using cell phones, we have to ensure no one involved in the exam process has it in person, except for those authorised. We have told flying squads to check for anyone carrying a cell phone to class. We will give them a warning and action will be taken in case of a repeat,” said Siddheshwar Chandekar, secretary, Mumbai division.
 
 A teacher supervising an HSC exam centre in Malad was warned and told to apologise on Wednesday, which has not gone well with teachers. “Exam conductors should give proper instructions to teachers. They cannot issue memos without informing teachers in advance. The teacher had switched off her phone and kept it in the bag but still she was told to apologise,” said Rajesh Pandya, vice-president, Teachers’ Democratic Front. 
 
 Board officials said instructions were issued repeatedly at meetings with supervisors.
