Bhopal: A passenger sent security personnel at Raja Bhoj airport aflutter on Saturday when four bullets were detected in his luggage just before he was to board a flight to Mumbai. Turned out, he was a police officer.

 Airport security handed him to Gandhi Nagar police, who let him go rather than register a case, saying it was negligence and not a crime.
 
 The officer, Anil Bamaniya, is posted as a traffic inspector in Rajgarh district. Police said four bullets — two each of 9mm and 5.56mm (Insas rifle ammo) — were found in his bag. When questioned by CISF personnel, the inspector identified himself and said he forgot he had the bullets in his bag. He tried to argue that bullets of this calibre are issued only to law enforcement, but airport security would have none of it and handed him to police.
 
 Additional SP Sameer Yadav told TOI that an inquiry has been initiated. “A case has not been registered since, prima facie, it appears there was no intention of crime,” he said.
 
 Sources say the bullets were issued to the inspector when he was town inspector in Biaora during the violent farmer agitation in early June. He was posted to Rajgarh on June 27, but did not hand over the bullets to the armoury. A complaint on this is pending in Biaora, officials said.
 
 Bamaniya told TOI: “I and my police party were attacked during the protest in Biaora and had to use force in self-protection. I registered a case of murderous assault against the protesters. The bullets have been with me since then and I forgot to hand it back to the department. It is negligence, as I did not realise the bullets were in the bag. I was travelling alone to Mumbai on personal work. Officials will decide on the matter after going through it.”
