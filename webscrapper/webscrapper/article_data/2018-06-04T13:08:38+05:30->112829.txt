JAIPUR: Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president Sachin Pilot has accused the BJP government of being insensitive towards common man by increasing the price of LPG. During programme ‘Mera Booth-Mera Gaurav’ at Rawatbhata in Chittorgarh on Sunday, he said that central and state government have completely failed in controlling the price rise. “The price rise of LPG is a major blow to the common man at a time when fuel price is skyrocketing. This is happening at a time when crude oil prices are falling,” said Pilot.

 
 Attacking chief minister Vasundhara Raje, the PCC head said that Raje has failed on all fronts in the state. “The regime has failed to deliver on all fronts—education, healthcare and development. It has lost the faith of people,” said Pilot who expressed that Congress is set to make a comeback in the state.
 
 “Raje government has disrespected the mandate given by the people of  . Provoking and insensitive statements by her legislators are hurting the sentiments of the people,” said Pilot, who is travelling across the state for his program ‘Mera Booth-Mera Gaurav’ programme.
 
 ‘Mera Booth-Mera Gaurav’ is statewide programme of Congress that was launched in Hadauti region on April 23. The aim of this program is to connect with the grassroots worker in each constituency before the polls. The campaign is also seen as an exercise to identify constituency and district-wise issues to corner BJP in the upcoming polls slated later in the year. “I am overwhelmed with the response. People are giving us the feedback that Raje government has not lived up to any promise. Our campaign will highlight the incompetency, misgovernance and corruption of BJP government in the state," Pilot said.
