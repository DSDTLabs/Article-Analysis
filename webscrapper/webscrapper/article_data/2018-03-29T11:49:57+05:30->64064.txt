 Similarly, the admissions secured by using fake caste certificates shall be cancelled. The degree of the guilty student will also be cancelled.The Bill provides for a new mechanism for obtaining the caste certificate.
 
 "The Competent Authority" appointed by the government would issue the caste certificate after verifying the genuineness of the applicant, the minister said.
 
 "Then the applicant needs to verify that certificate from a scrutiny committee and get a validity certificate," said Vasava. The scrutiny committee can also initiate an inquiry on its own if it suspects that a person is taking benefit of reservations by using a fake caste certificate.
