JAIPUR: A large numbers of residents were found harbouring   in their water coolers etc. Unfortunately, the state has no provision of penalising such people like in other cities such as Mumbai. Around two per cent of the total water tanks checked by health officials placed in houses or constructed in houses to store water were found containing mosquito   in a door-to-door   conducted by the health department in the state from March 21 to March 23.

 Moreover, more than two per cent of total air coolers checked by the health department officials found to have mosquito larvae. Besides, people keep water pots for birds but they forget to clean them regularly. In the survey, the health officials found that more than eight per cent of water pots, flower pots and other such items contained mosquito larvae.
 
 According to the health department report issued on March 12, there were 803 persons who tested positive for dengue this year. Jaipur, which has reported highest number of swine flu cases, is also facing the threat of dengue. In Jaipur 405 cases of the disease have already been reported.
 
 The larvae found in houses would have grown in adult mosquito to spread mosquito-borne diseases in the state. Now health department officials hoping that the cases of dengue, chikungunya and malaria would be reduced, as they have destroyed the breeding grounds of mosquitoes in the state.
 
 According to the health department officials, there were more than 54,000 sites found in houses which were having mosquito larvae. “It was a joint effort of government departments which made the state wide campaign successful in identifying sites of mosquito breeding,” said Dr SN  , state nodal officer,   (IDSP).
 
 During the survey, the health department officials with the help of civic bodies conducted fogging at 74,707 places in the entire state.
