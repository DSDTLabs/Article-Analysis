Missile pao, Pasta nashta, Mr Aloowalia… serving all this and more is one more restaurant, which joins the new Tsunami of ‘Modern Indian restaurants’ sweeping Mumbai. We check it out to find out which of its names it lives up to — ‘Hitchki’ as in the hiccup, which connotes that someone is remembering or thinking of you? Or ‘Hitchki’, as in the hiccup, the glitch? The setback? Impediment? It turns out to be the first… Happily.

 
 
 Nudged into the Kala Ghoda precinct, this dimly-lit   is two levelled. Patterned, Athangudi, minimal charcoal grey walls and ceiling, steel and wooden furniture complete the décor.
 
 
 
 We ate our way through the menu and dined here twice. The Indian-Lebanese jugalbandi of flavours works brilliantly in the   (Pithla Hummus, Smoked Baingan Tabouleh, Dahi Haydari, pomegranate tomato Turkish Acili Ezme, Yemeni Sahawiq basil coriander Choleaadi and Bhakri Lavash). Also recommended is the delicious fragrant Ghee rice with rich, warm roast chicken. The rich dark and robustly spiced Savji Mutton comes up tops. 
 Surprise! Even the Beer Bunny Chowder Soup and spicy Rasam Minestrone are must-trys. As are the meaty Charlie Chaplin Kebab and Laksa paste infused Prawn Biryani and Chaas spiked with Wasabi chilli. End with the Shah misu eggless sponge rabdi. 
 
 
 
 Dimly-lit and too dark for an open through the day restaurant; though this works well as a bar at night. Long and confusing menu. Their signature bacon pancake lasagne is a gloopy confused mess. Thick-skinned and unappealing Momos. Oily, tasteless Patrani Chilli Popper. Some dishes have combinations that are like failed marriages.
 
 
 
 This open through the day, Kala Ghoda entrant is commendably moderately-priced (both food and straight drinks). It has an Indian soul in an adventurous contemporary avatar. We welcome this hiccup (Hitchki)!
