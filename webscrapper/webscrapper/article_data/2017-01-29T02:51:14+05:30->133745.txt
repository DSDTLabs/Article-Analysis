New Delhi: With the arrest of three men, the   claims to have busted a  .   in the denomination of Rs 2,000—with a total face value of Rs 18 lakh—have been seized from them. 

 The crooks had printed the notes in ascending order and people would probably never realise that those were  , said cops. 
 
 The arrested have been identified as   (36), Manoj (37) and Sunil (27). An SUV, a motorcycle and three mobile phones have been seized as well. Sunil is an accused in a case of sexual assault on a woman. Azad was involved in abductions and robberies.
 
 DCP (special cell) Sanjeev Yadav said that the notes were being printed at a makeshift mint in outer Delhi’s Narela. “The gang had installed a printing machine. They used high-quality papers to print the notes,” he added.
 
 The notes were being supplied to hawala operators, bookies, toll plazas and wholesale markets. From bookies, the crooks charged Rs 40,000 in genuine notes in exchange for Rs 1 lakh in fakes.
 
 Constable Kuldeep had received information that a racket comprising criminals from Sonepat in Haryana and Delhi were involved in scanning, printing and circulating counterfeit notes of Rs 2,000 denomination.
 
 There was a tip-off that the gang members would assemble near a traffic signal at Village Singhola, Narela, around 11pm on Friday. Accordingly, a team led by inspector   laid a trap and arrested the trio after a brief scuffle. Manoj and Sunil were carrying two packets, each containing fake currency having a face value of Rs 8 lakh while Azad had a consignment with a face value of Rs 2 lakh. 
 
 A fortnight ago, the cops had busted a similar FICN module and seized notes with face value of Rs 6.5 lakh in southwest Delhi.
 
 Azad is the mastermind of the racket and used to get the notes scanned and printed. The other two were supposed to circulate the notes to the customers. Police said Manoj was known to a Delhi-based hawala dealer.
