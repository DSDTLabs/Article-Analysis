KOLHAPUR: Around 11,000   have been opened in   of high-value notes on November 8, last year. This will help bring people in the unorganised sector into formal banking channels, authorities said.

 People outside the formal banking system suffered a lot during the post-demonetisation period. Consequently, banks in public and private sectors organised over a 1,000 camps to open accounts for such people. They also provided ‘zero balance’ facility to attract people. Adoption of villages by banks by nationalised banks to promote cashless transactions post-demonetisation also resulted in more people coming under formal banking system.
 
 S G Kininge, manager of the lead bank for the district,  , said, “The banks have brought the construction and farm labours, farmers, and women into the system. As many as 10,842 people in the district have opened accounts since demonetisation. We have distributed Rupay cards to these customers. these steps will boost cashless transactions and direct money transfer under various schemes.”
 
 Another official from a nationalised bank said, “We got good response to our camps. Farm labourers were very keen to open accounts. Also, since the government has decided to transfer subsidy on ration through bank accounts, many people wanted to open accounts.”
