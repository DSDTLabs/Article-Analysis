AHMEDABAD: With cyber crime increasing and the rate of online fraud rising almost 50% after demonetization, nine police ranges, three police commissionerates and the state crime records bureau (SCRB) will get cyber crime investigation kits, all together worth Rs 6 crore.

 Deputy commissioner of police, crime branch,   said that at present Ahmedabad   cyber cell and the cyber cell of CID crime are two specialized agencies to probe cyber crime in the state.
 
 “With distribution of these kits to police headquarters across the state, each district will be able to probe   and be   in investigating serious crimes using  ,” said Bhadran.
 
 Senior police officials said the kits, which include mobile phone investigation kit, cyber forensic kit and internet analysis kits, were bought by city crime branch from various companies.
 
 Crime branch officials said arming all districts and cities with the kits would reduce the burden of work on the city crime branch cyber cell and CID cyber cell.
 
 “We have 1,500 applications from cyber crime victims that are yet to be probed. We are also transferring less serious offences to the police stations under whose jurisdiction the crime took place,” said a senior cyber cell official.
 
 The proposal to set up a cyber crime police station with an independent station dairy is still under consideration.
 
 Crime branch sources said they demanded an ACP-level officer, four police inspectors, 10 sub inspectors and total staff of about 100 for the cyber crime police station.
