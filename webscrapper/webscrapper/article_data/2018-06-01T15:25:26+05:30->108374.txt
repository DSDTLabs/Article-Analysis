In an attempt to spread awareness about the law and create discrimination-free workplaces, GenderSense and   recently presented three choreographed acts titled Act to Prevent on the issue of sexual harassment of women in the workplace. The event held at the   was a success as it saw people coming forward and sharing their experiences.

 The dance drama was led by a group of Kathak dancers trying to make people socially and culturally aware through performing arts and stories. "The problem is that many workplaces are either unaware of laws against sexual harassment laws or choose not to comply with them. Through these acts we tried to cover every aspect of the issue," says  , kathak danceuse.
 
 The first act was about the what a woman goes through mentally after being targetted or victimised at the workplace. The second dance act was about the do's and don'ts. "This act is about what the victim should and should not do. This will be a kathak performance where the story will be told using the mudras and expressions," adds Toshal. Their last act was on those people who use sexual harassment to get away with situations, or gain sympathy. All these acts were followed by interactive sessions.
