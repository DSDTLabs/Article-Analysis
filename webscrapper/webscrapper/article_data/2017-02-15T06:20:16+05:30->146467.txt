 National Public School, Rajajinagar and others preferred a batch of writ appeals challenging the single bench's January 16, 2017 order dismissing their petitions against the said government order.
 
 The appellants claimed they are protected under Article 30 of the Constitution since they're minority institutions, and also by the   verdict that RTE is not applicable to minority institutions, whether unaided or aided.
