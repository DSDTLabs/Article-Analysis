 Earlier, Union labour minister   met the grieving family and consoled them. “It is heartbreaking that Vamsi lost his life after being shot by a criminal,” he said. The Centre is working with other countries on issues related to safety of Indian students abroad, he said.
 
 Yugender Reddy, Vamsi’s cousin, said that his family had been dependent on him and was relying on his prospects after his education. They now face a bleak future and are burdened with financial worries. He appealed to the state government to provide either some monetary assistance or a job to one of the members of Vamsi’s family.
 
 Dr Praveen Kumar, an anaesthesiologist who hails from Vangapahad, also called on the Union government to put in place measures to ensure the safety and security of Indian students abroad.
