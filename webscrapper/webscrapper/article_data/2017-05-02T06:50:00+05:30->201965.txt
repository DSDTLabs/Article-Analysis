NAGPUR: “Human beings spend their entire lives searching for the sole reason behind their peace and most of them fail to experience it,” said Nanded-based psychiatrist consultant, Dr   while delivering a   on ‘Mann Udhaan Varyache’.

 The event was a part of the series of lectures organized by Professor’s Colony   in the memory of noted professor in philosophy Narayan Shastri Dravid. They are being conducted at the Gruhni Samaj Hall, Professor’s Colony, Hanuman Nagar, on Sunday.
 
 Mulmule said, “Your source of joy changes with every phase of life. Your friends might be a priority in the early stages, followed by a soul mate in youth and later money.”
 
 According to him, “we are in an era where it is essential to teach people about the inner peace”. “They assume it to be etched in success, pleasure, happiness which are related to social, biological and psychological context respectively. But in reality, contentment is the key which satisfies you spiritually,” said Mulmule.
 
 He believes that often it is the envious attitude responsible for the restless mind. “After you discover your niche, you notice someone who is a notch above than you. This causes insecurity and you don’t settle down in ease till you beat them in the competition,” said Mulmule.
 
 Discussing about   being one of the poorest nations in the world, Mulmule revealed it is the happiest and people live in merriment with the small income they make.
 
 Mulmule said, “Live in the present freely and enjoy the path you walk along, because eternal bliss lies in the journey, not the destination.”
 
 “In order to knock down the inferiority complex, you must know and accept your limits and embrace your flaws. Become mature enough to learn that others make mistakes too. So let go off your ego and resort to forgiveness,” he added.
