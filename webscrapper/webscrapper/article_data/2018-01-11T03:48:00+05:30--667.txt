Panaji: Following a series of discussions with stakeholders from various government departments, Imagine Panaji Smart City Development Ltd (IPSCDL) is now zeroing on the consultant who will prepare the   plan for the state. Speaking to reporters, IPSCDL chief executive officer Swayan Chaudhuri, said that the consultant would be selected by January 15.

 Of the 23 consultants empanelled by the Union ministry for housing and urban affairs, two companies, UMTC and ICRA Management Ltd, have shown interest. 
 
 IPSCDL has opened the bids and the evaluation process is on after which the contract will be signed with the successful bidder.
 
 “The work order will be issued by the end of the week,” Chaudhuri said, while adding that it would take 5-6 months to prepare the plan and implement it phase-wise.
 
 Chaudhuri went on to say that the comprehensive mobility plan would have a statutory status and would be recognized by the town and country planning (TCP) department while granting construction permissions for the city.
 
 Stressing on the need to revamp the state’s public transportation system, director of IPSCDL, Sidharth Kuncalienkar said, “If we want to synchronize and modernize the bus transport system, the public bicycle system and the ferry system, I think we need to bring in a new system and for that, it has been decided to form a comprehensive mobility plan,” the former Panaji MLA said.
 
 The state government had made a budgetary allocation for creation of a comprehensive mobility plan to improve the inter-city and intra-city transportation. “We opened the tenders for consultants just yesterday and the bids will be evaluated. The work will be given to them soon so that maybe within the next six months, we can have a concrete plan in hand.”
 
 Kuncalienkar also said the SPV formed to implement the smart city mission was exploring the option of bringing in bicycles and electric powered cycles “so that people can cycle up Altinho slope”.
