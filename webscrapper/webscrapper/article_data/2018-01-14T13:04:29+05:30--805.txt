When filmmaker Kamal recently commented that if Bollywood actress   had been the lead of his next film 'Aami,' it would have been high on sexual content, it did not go down well with many. 

 Ever since, the online space has been witnessing many hilarious trolls and comments about how the filmmaker does not seem to have a good idea about the life of the writer, who was very bold and wrote openly about her private life, in her books. Movie enthusiasts also wonder how sexual content would have intruded into the film anyway, without the director's knowledge, whoever would have played Kamala Das.
 
 Writer Kamala Das aka Kamala Surayya is often compared in the literary world to Sylvia Plath, for her style of confessional writing, baring it all about her life. One has to wait and watch what Kamal's take on it is, if he has presumably excluded everything that was controversial about her life.
