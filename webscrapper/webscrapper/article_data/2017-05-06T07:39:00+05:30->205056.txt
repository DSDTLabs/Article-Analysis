LUDHIANA: Panic gripped areas near   when a godown containing furnace oil caught fire as labourers were shifting furnace oil from big drums to small ones on Friday afternoon. The fire spread in no time and three blasts occuurred one after the other. 

 A plastic factory nearby also caught fire and raw material worth lakhs was gutted. Four more godowns and two cars were also caught in the conflagration as highly inflammable material aggravated the situation. 
 
 The fire brigade took 30 to 35 minutes to reach the spot, but most of the factory had been gutted by then. While there were no major casualties, owner of the land, Sharan Singh sustained burn injuries while rescuing workers.
 
 Fire station officer   said, “the fire broke out at around 12.30pm when factory workers were shifting furnace oil from big drums to small ones. One of the drums fell down and fire broke out, spreading to nearby godowns in no time”.
 
 According to him, the chemical factory, in which large amounts of flammable material is stored, lacks basic fire safety equipment.
 
 “A total of 15 fire tenders were used to douse the fire and it took more than two hours because it is a   and we had to use foam as water could not be used”, said Kakkar. 
 
 Sukwinder Singh, son of the land owner said, “I gave my land to the owner of the chemical godown and plastic manufacturer on rent a few months ago. But when I came to know about this fire incident, I ran to my land and saw that most of the plastic factory had been gutted. I was shocked to see the condition around”.
 
 Labourers working at the plastic factory climbed the poles supporting the roof and jumped on to the roof of another factory to escape. The blaze cut off the main entrance. 
 
 The owner of the chemical godown is on the run because he did not have requisite permission from relevant departments.
