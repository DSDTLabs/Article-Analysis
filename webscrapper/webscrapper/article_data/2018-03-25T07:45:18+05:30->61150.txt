NEW DELHI: Stalked and threatened by a youth over a week, a 17-year-old girl who was preparing for a police recruitment test allegedly killed herself at her house in Rohini on Friday afternoon. 

  Neighbours found her hanging from a fan soon after her mother took lunch for her husband and two sons to their shop. 
 
  
  
 
 The girl, who studied in Class XII at a government school and lived in   near Alipur in Rohini, left behind a suicide note blaming her 20-year-old neighbour Mayank. "They (Mayank and his accomplices) are ruining my life," she wrote. 
 
  DCP (Rohini) Rajneesh Gupta said Mayank has fled the village but they have registered a case against him under child protection act POCSO and Section 306 IPC (deals with abetment of suicide).
