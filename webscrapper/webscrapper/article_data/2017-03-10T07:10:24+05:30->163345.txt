PUNE: The   may soon clear a proposal to transfer 7,800 hectare of land to the   (PMRDA) to make it  .
The land bank, similar to the one carved out for Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), will be spread over 10 talukas in the Pune district. According to sources, a special order in this regard is expected to be issued shortly.
 
 As per district collectorate officials, the PMRDA region, which is spread over 10 talukas in the district, has nearly 6,000 hectares of grazing land and 1,800 hectares of land belonging to various government institutions.
 
 “These plots will be transferred in the name of PMRDA shortly ,“ the officials said.
 
 The proposal for the land bank, which is created by acquiring commercially profitable land, has been pending since the formation of the PMRDA in 2015.
 
 Though chief minister   had given his approval to the creation of land bank, the transfer is yet to take place, the officials said, adding that the PMRDA would emulate the same model as that of the MMRDA as reiterated by the chief minister.
 
 The MMRDA model includes planning of development projects and executing them. Its financial model rests heavily on its land bank, which the authority uses to raise funds and implement various projects.
 
 The idea here is that after civic amenities such as roads, lights, water and sewage have been developed, the land prices shoot up by 1520%. The income generated from the sale or commercial use of this land is used for the development works.
 
 In Pune, state government departments, including irrigation, revenue, forest and others, have large patches of land in the city .
 
 While admitting that a large part of the yet to be transferred land has been encroached upon, a senior official said, “How and when this land bank is be made available to the PMRDA will have to be seen.“
