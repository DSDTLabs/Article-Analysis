Mumbai:   — the lender with the highest percentage of   — has reported a net loss of Rs 5,662 crore for the quarter ended March 2018 against a loss of Rs 3,199 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. 

 The losses widened as the bank made additional provisions of Rs 10,773 crore for the quarter ended March 2018, partly because of a new Reserve   (RBI) circular that scrapped all loan-restructuring schemes.
 
 Another PSU lender,   — the third-largest public sector lender — also reported a net loss of Rs 3,102 crore for Q4FY18 as against a net profit of Rs 155 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, again due to bad loan provisions. Adding these two results to the earnings of the 15 banks already reported, the total losses of lenders have now grown to Rs 53,005 crore. Three more lenders — Bank of India,   — are yet to announce results.
 
 IDBI Bank is responding to the loss by selling non-core assets such as stakes in its mutual fund and life insurance companies. It also plans to shut down a few branches and ATMs that are not profitable. Announcing the results, the bank’s MD & CEO M K Jain said that the lender would hire vertical heads for information technology, human relations and treasury from the private sector. He said that the bank also plans to sell non-performing assets (NPAs) worth Rs 21,000 crore. The bank’s gross NPA soared to 27.95% of its loans at end-March 2018 compared to 21.25% at the end of March 2017. IDBI Bank said that it continued to have loans worth Rs 14,000 crore under watch for stress.
 
 Announcing the results on Friday, Bank of Baroda MD & CEO P S Jayakumar said that following the provisioning, among the standard loans, at the most Rs 10,000 crore would be under stress and there have been no delinquency in the loans advanced since 2015. “Going forward, quality of growth will be good and there has been a dramatic improvement in the quality of assets. The infrastructure that we have invested in will result in 20% growth in coming quarters,” said Jayakumar.
 
 Gross NPAs of the bank stood at 12.26% in March 2018 as compared to 11.31% in December 2017. In absolute terms, gross NPAs stood at Rs 56,480 crore as of March 2018 as compared to Rs 48,480 crore last year. “Out of this, fresh slippage of Rs 4,374 crore is on account of implementation of RBI’s new guidelines on restructured assets,” said Jayakumar.
 
 The bank in its results reported that there was a divergence of Rs 2,918 crore between the gross non-performing assets reported by the bank on March 2017 and that assessed by the RBI. Jayakumar said that the divergence was on account of loans to corporates such as Videocon, which was recognised by other banks as NPA but not yet classified by the bank. The lender has adjusted the net profit after taking into account the divergence in provisioning.
 
 Capital adequacy of the bank was above regulatory norms at 12.13%, of which 10.46% was tier-1 capital. The bank’s total advances increased 12.79% from Rs 4.08 lakh crore to Rs 4.6 lakh crore. Domestic deposits increased 6.11% to Rs 4.66 lakh crore from Rs 4.4 lakh crore.
