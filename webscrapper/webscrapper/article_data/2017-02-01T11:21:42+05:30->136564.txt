JABALPUR: Hardly a week after a   was issued against a leader of the community for his public statements opposing  , two groups clashed on the issue on Tuesday forcing cops to resort to lathicharge to control the situation. 

 The clash took place outside a prominent city hotel where the   organised a meet to discuss the issue of ‘triple talaq’ in the light of the social, education status and sharia. While the meet was on, a group of protesters reached the venue and tried to disrupt the proceedings leading to an altercation with the hosts.

 Later Khan was arrested under section 151 and mild force was used to control the situation. 
 
 Just a week ago, on January 23, Darul   a religious body from Jabalpur, issued a ‘fatwa’ against the chairperson of state backward class and minority finance development corporation, S K Muddin calling for his social boycott till he apologises. 
 
 Muddin allegedly during a press conference had said that triple talaq was against ‘shariat’.
 
 When TOI contacted Muddin, he said, “I am with shariat, but I am against triple talaq. Even in holy Quran triple talaq is considered an extreme sin. Talaq should be given as per provisions of holy Quran and shariat. I am against those who are giving divorce against the shariat.
 
 “I am also discussing the issue with legal experts and planning to file defamation suit for issuing fatwa against me on wrong grounds.”
