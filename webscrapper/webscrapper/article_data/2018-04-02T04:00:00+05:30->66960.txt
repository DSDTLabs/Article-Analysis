Surat:  , tension gripped the city after Udhna and Amroli when groups belonging to two different communities came face to face with each other at Limbayat in the early hours of Sunday. 

 There was tension in the area after few men in a procession being taken out to mark Hanuman Jayanti climbed on the wall of a mosque with flags in their hands. The trouble started after locals decided to take out a procession in Limbayat at around 8pm on Saturday. The procession stopped near Mecca Mosque where many youths began to dance to film music being played on high frequency sound system. 
 
 Meanwhile, two men from the procession climbed on to the wall of the mosque and started to dance there while others with swords and flags in their hands cheered them on. The duo got down from the wall when the procession stared to move ahead. The entire incident was captured on CCTV camera installed in the area where now heavy police security has been deployed.
 
 “We have arrested 28 people who were involved in the incident at Limbayat. Police security has been tightened in the area. I have cautioned the officers to ensure peaceful situation in the locality,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said.
 
 Meanwhile, a rumour began making rounds that some people had damaged the minarets of the mosque. Police immediately called some community leaders for inspection but they were attacked by a group of local residents. Soon, groups from both communities began to gather at the spot and uncertainty prevailed until police moved quickly and ensured that peace prevailed in the area. 
 
 Police have booked Sagar Dogre, who had taken out the procession without police permission in Limbayat.
