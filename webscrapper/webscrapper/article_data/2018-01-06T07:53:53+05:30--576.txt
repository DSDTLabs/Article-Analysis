AHMEDABAD: All four   (FRC) has set a deadline of January 17 for all   to submit their final proposals and documents for fixation of fee structure.

 Officials said that if any school fails to submit an application for fixation of fees along with supportive documents to justify its fee structure, it will not have any further opportunity to put up his case. Such a school will have to accept the fee structure that is finalized by the FRC.
 
 The deadline has been set after   high court upheld the constitutional validity of the fee regulation law introduced by the state government to rein in private schools from charging exorbitant fees.
 
 Following the HC verdict, the   has decided to move the Supreme Court and challenge the stateâ€™s law. The state government, on the other hand, has set things in motion for filing a caveat in order to avoid any ex-parte order. tnn
