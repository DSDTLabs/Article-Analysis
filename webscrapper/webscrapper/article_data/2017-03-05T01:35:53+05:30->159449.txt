NEW DELHI: To effectively fight the water scarcity and maintain greenery in Lutyens’ zone,   (NDMC) will set up 20 sewage treatment plants. The first of the lot, sanctioned last year, was inaugurated by   on Saturday.

 Located on Peshwa Road, the STP is fitted with the latest technology, capable of treating 20 lakh litre of sewage every day. The treated water can be used for horticulture purposes. The 20 STPs, once operational, will be able to treat a huge amount of sewage and will produce enough water to make entire NDMC region lush green. “Around seven STPs will be ready by next month. We are trying to speed up the process and ensure that all 20 plants are built soon,” NDMC chairman Naresh Kumar told TOI. 
 
 The Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering Research Institute is assisting the civic body in executing the project. Lauding NDMC’s efforts, Baijal said, “NDMC is doing an excellent job. I have been watching Delhi for over 40 years, but I did not know that its level of efficiency was so high.” The LG maintained that since the groundwater level was depleting in the capital, water conservation was the need of the hour. 
 
 Over 48% of NDMC’s area is green. There are six major gardens, 124 small parks besides hundreds of colony parks in its jurisdiction. “It is increasingly becoming difficult to meet the water requirement of the parks. The summer takes a toll on the greenery because NDMC does not have any major source of water of its own. We have to depend on DJB water for drinking purpose and extract groundwater for maintenance of parks,” an official said.
 
 Baijal also inaugurated a smart public toilet at Janpath, equipped with a roof-top solar panel. It comprises a bank ATM, a water ATM, a digital health clinic and a sanitary vending machine, among others. He stressed on making Delhi one of the best smart cities in the world.
 
 Once the 20 STPs are ready, NDMC will build more such projects in public-private-partnership mode.
