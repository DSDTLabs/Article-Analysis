It’s not easy to see your significant other romance someone else on screen. Ask  , whose beau   had to enact some intimate scenes with his co-actor   Khan in his upcoming film. 
While Abhinav was clinical in his approach,   was not very comfortable seeing her boyfriend kiss on screen. He says, “On-screen kissing is quite technical. I have kissed even in my earlier film 'Roar' and a TV show. There are so many people watching you that there is no scope for any feelings to develop. So, there is no reason for your girlfriend to get upset. However, despite being an actress, Rubina was very upset and I had to explain it to her. She felt that if I had to kiss on screen, the scene should be really crucial to the storyline.”
  Describing how uncomfortable the shoot was, Abhinav says, “Both Zareen and I were sitting in a tent and it was so hot that I wanted the scene to get over. Even on my TV show, the actress kissed kissed me in a jiffy and before I could realise what happened, everything was over.” 
  Ask Abhinav if he is comfortable with Rubina romancing Vivian Dsena in her show Shakti…Astitva Ek Ehsaas Ki and he says, “If the show was happening 10 years ago, maybe I would not have been happy about it. However, I have matured over the years and I know that it’s a part of the job. In fact, I told Rubina to do romantic scenes convincingly; otherwise they would not look real and it would not be fair to the viewers and the makers.” 
  Abhinav adds, “If you are still uncomfortable watching your partner get intimate on screen, you can avoid watching that scene, but you can’t stop him/ her from doing justice to their profession.”
