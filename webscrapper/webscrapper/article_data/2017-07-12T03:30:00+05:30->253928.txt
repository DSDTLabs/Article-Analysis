Panaji: After a surprise inspection at Panaji urban health centre (UHC) on Tuesday, health minister Vishwajit Rane issued a note to health secretary to issue a memo to the director of the directorate of health services, Dr Sanjeev Dalvi, and UHC’s health officer Dr Preetam Naik for short supply of medicines at the center.  Rane also directed the health secretary to seek a detailed explanation from both as to why medicines were not available at the outpatient department (OPD). During his visit, Rane found that regular medicines, like Metformin meant for treating diabetes, distributed at the OPD was unavailable. Rane said it is for more than three months that the UHC is running without medicines, and added that they will be made available in the next 48 hours. “I was shocked to find that even diabetes medicines were not available. If this is the state of affairs in the CM’s constituency, I’ve no clue what is going on at other health centres. Insulin pens are already available at Mapusa district hospital and the same should be made available at UHC,” Rane told TOI. “ . I’ve issued a note to the health secretary to issue both a memo,” said Rane. Besides allopathic, homeopathic and ayurvedic medicines are also in short supply at the UHC, compelling patients to purchase them from outside. Taking Dr Dalvi to task for the poor state of affairs at the primary health centre (PHC) and the UHC, Rane directed him not to travel out of Goa for next two-three months.“I have directed Dr Dalvi not to travel out of the state till UHCs and PHCs are properly functioning. In case of an emergency, the deputy director of health may travel,” said Rane.
