Filmmaker  , who recently addressed a session at  , shared his business vision.

  Being a renowned filmmaker and president of  , Kapur has been a game changer in the Indian film Industry. The filmmaker has largely got into monitoring the Micro and Macro aspects of film-making by all possible means.
 
  Kapur has treated the audiences with films like ' ', ' ', ' ', 'Jodha Akhbar', ' ', ' ' and the latest one to be 'Dangal'.
 
  Kapur shared, "When it comes to business, my vision is that whatever films I make I should be proud of them and they should make their money back if I have to continue to make movies. I want to make movies that return their investments and make money for those who are investing in them and give us the profits. But I should also be proud of the movies. These two are my prompt approaches."
 
  The filmmaker further noted, "While we were making 'Rang De Basanti' with Aamir Khan is was obvious that the film would add up commercial appeal where Bhagat Singh and all other characters die in the end. It's not that we weren't taking any risk, it's just that we were taking a considerate risk. What I feel when it comes to the business of cinema we need to take well-calculated risks but your first responsibility has to be a creative response, that's just the way that I try to make the movies that I do".
 
  The films, helmed by Kapur, have gone out to become blockbusters and commercial hits that were widely appreciated by the masses.
