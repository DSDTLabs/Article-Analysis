 We all know Chandra as the CEO of TCS, under whose leadership the company has made rapid strides in profit and revenues, and is today among the flagship companies of the  . However, that is just a part of Chandra. Having known him for a few years now, what I truly admire and respect is that he has a good mix of business acumen and humility, extremely grounded and genuinely a great human being.
 
 As a fellow marathoner, what I appreciate about him is his confidence, his ability to pace himself as per the situation and act accordingly. This has been reflective of his business approach as well, having guided TCS right after the financial crisis of 2008, identifying key opportunities while at the same time being cognisant of any accompanying risks of going too fast too soon. 
 
 Like any marathoner, being committed and determined comes naturally to him — surely a pre-requisite for any individual primed to lead one of India’s largest conglomerates. One key quality is his perseverance, which has come from his learning that there are no short cuts in life and you require focus and rigour to complete a marathon. Similar holds true for building a sustainable, long-term and profitable business. He is patient and calm and at the same time highly focused and achievement-oriented and has been a great inspiration and a big supporter to a lot of people, who have taken to running.
 
 Being a Tata veteran, he understands the group inside out, which is particularly significant for a new Tata chairman, considering the vast array of businesses. Having also worked with many of his peers, I have always known him to be an extremely hands-on leader, which will hold him in good stead in this new role. 
 
 Chandra is the right man for this role and this is truly a logical and smart move by  . He has a long innings ahead of him and would definitely be a valuable asset to the Tata Group.
