CHENNAI: A Class XII student stabbed his classmate on Friday afternoon on the campus of a government school in Kovoor.

 The teenage assailant, who used the sharp end of a small hacksaw blade in the attack, held a grudge against the victim, the police said.
 
 “He left the blade, which broke in half when he plunged it into the other boy, and fled the scene,” an investigating officer said. “We caught him in the evening.”
 
 Police said, S  , the son of a grocery store owner who lives in Pattur, had just completed the Class XII computer science examination on Friday when the attack took place.
 
 “Sheik was talking to friends near the school gate when his classmate, Raghavan*, a resident of Thandalam, approached him,” the officer said. “Raghavan told   that he wanted to speak to him. When they were a few metres away from Sheik’s friends,   pulled out the blade from his bag and stabbed him.”
 
 Sheik swooned, bleeding from his stomach. His parents, who had come to pick him up from school, took him to  , where doctors said his condition was stable. On a complaint from Sheik’s parents, the   police registered a case of attempted murder against Raghavan.
 
 A probe revealed that the duo belonged to two groups that considered themselves rival gangs. “Boys from both groups had frequent fights to ‘establish their supremacy’ in school and in the locality,” the officer said. “The groups had spats whenever either side played a game of cricket in the area where the other side thought of as their territory.”
 
 Raghavan told the police during questioning that he had been planning to attack Sheik for a long time.
 
 “Raghavan attacked Sheik only after the last exam because he knew he would not have been able to appear for another paper he did so earlier,” the officer said.
 
 The police have sent Raghavan to a government observation home.
