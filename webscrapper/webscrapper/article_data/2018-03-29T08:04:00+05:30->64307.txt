BENGALURU:   on Wednesday opined that   is among the   and that the   is the result of ignoring other regions.

 “While other southern states have   separated from political capital, Karnataka has Bengaluru as the single hub of growth and that’s the reason for multiple problems, including skewed development in the state,” Guha said. 
 
 His talk on ‘My Idea of Karnataka’ was the first in the lecture series, Loka Samvada, organised by Bengaluru Central University, and it was followed by a panel discussion moderated by political scientist Valerian Rodrigues. The university launched two compendiums ‘Speaking for Karnataka’ in English and ‘Karnataka Kathana’ in Kannada.
 
 Guha noted that Kerala has its commercial capital in Kochi and political capital in Thiruvananthapuram, while Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are doing much better having developed multiple commercial hubs.
 
 Guha’s confession that he’s a non-Kannada-speaking Kannadiga triggered a discussion on migrants learning the local language. Historian S Settar raised a question as to how to address the complexity of a third-generation migrant like Guha claiming with pride that he hasn’t learnt the local language.
 
 L Vasudevamurthy, academic council member of Visvesvaraya Technological University, said learning Kannada shouldn’t be difficult for a person like Guha who is regarded as among the best minds in the county. 
 
 The historian, however, sought to highlight that Karnataka has more diversity in terms of ecology and culture as compared to other states.
