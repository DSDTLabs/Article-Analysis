PATNA: While RJD chief   has announced that he would campaign for UP CM   and Congress in the assembly polls, JD(U) is yet to decide whether Bihar CM   will do the same.
 
  “Akhilesh’s SP is in talks with Congress only. They had initially involved us in the talks, along with Ajit Singh’s Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD). But as of now, it is between Congress and SP only. Let these two major players decide first, then we will take a call on alliance with secular forces in UP. A clear picture will emerge in two-three days,” JD(U) national secretary general   told TOI on phone.
  
  Tyagi said JD(U) has always favoured larger alliance among secular forces in UP. “Initially, we wished that SP and BSP would come together and contest elections by forming a Bihar-like grand alliance. Since it could not formalise, JD(U) now wants a greater alliance under Akhilesh’s leadership,” he said.
  
  To a question whether Nitish would campaign for Akhilesh, Tyagi said the initiative to involve Bihar CM in any larger alliance formation should be taken from the UP CM’s side. “Akhilesh will have to begin the process,” Tyagi said, adding that JD(U) would not hesitate from joining the secular alliance if an “honourable offer” came from Akhilesh’s side.
  
  JD(U) had contested 219 seats in 2012 UP assembly polls, but could not open its account. The party’s vote share was less than one per cent.
  
  “Our performance in 2012 was not satisfactory because we went to the polls without necessary groundwork. But this time, our national president (Nitish) held more than 10 rallies in different parts of UP and emerged as a strong backward leader, especially among the agrarian castes like Kurmi, Patel and Koeris, who constitute 8 to 10% votes in more than 150 assembly segments in eastern region,” Tyagi said.
  
  He added that Nitish has gained popularity among the women voters across all communities because of his campaign for Bihar-like liquor ban in UP.
