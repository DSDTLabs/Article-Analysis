PONDA: Setting an example to shopkeepers occupying the dilapidated Shastri Memorial Hall building at Ponda, the   ( ) has initiated the process of shifting its public library from the building. The library will now have a new address in the municipal market complex at Upper Bazaar. 

 The building is fast deteriorating and a study conducted by the Goa Engineering College ( ), Farmagudi, has already reported that the building may collapse anytime. Pointing towards the poor maintenance of the building, the study states that the building is leaning towards its front side. 
 
 The study has revealed that the seepage of rainwater into its structural components has resulted in deterioration of the building. The GEC team, which had studied the stability of the building, had advised the PMC in October 2016 to demolish the 335.13 sq m structure and redevelop it.
 
 However, the PMC acted only after a balcony of a building in Vasco collapsed. Following the Vasco tragedy, the municipality, in June, hastily issued notices to occupants to vacate the building. The council has also offered space to rehabilitate the shopkeepers in the upper bazaar market complex until the new project gets completed.
 
 Situated near the Ponda police station, the building, which is a little over 40 years old, houses the municipal library on the first floor, and several shops and an office of Ponda Journalistsâ€™ Association on the ground floor. The building had its Shastri Memorial Hall on second floor, but the PMC has stopped using it since the past nine years.
 
 PMC councillor Irwyn Soares said the council has already begun the process of shifting the library and it would be open to the public from August 15. In the meanwhile, the readers can use the government library near the PMC office, he said.
