BENGALURU: Demonetisation has pushed many farmers to go digital. Platforms like TheAgrihub, AgroStar, BigHaat, and RML AgTech that provide services and products to farmers say there's been a significant increase in payments done through debit cards, credit cards, netbanking and other digital modes.

 BigHaat, an e-commerce platform that sells agricultural products including seeds and fertilisers, has seen its online payment transactions grow from 5% of overall transactions six months ago, to 30%. Over 5,000 farmers, mainly in Punjab, Maharashtra, and Chhattisgarh in the north and Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra in the south, transact on it.
 
 "Buying products online itself is a big step (for farmers), and they do it because they want genuine products. Now they are also beginning to pay digitally. This made us pilot PoS (point of sale) machines in some areas in Punjab recently. In those areas, we are seeing almost 90% of the transactions being done on these machines," says Sateesh Nukala, who started BigHaat with Sachin Nandwana in 2014.
 
 Bhupinder Singh (31) is a farmer in the Jalandhar district of Punjab and now makes his transactions through debit card. Singh says he wouldn't have thought about using his card before but demonetization left him with no choice. "BigHaat's delivery guys would come with swipe machines and I could just swipe my debit card. It's easier now," he says.
 
 AgroStar, which has over 10 lakh farmers on its platform and which recently raised funding from  , saw its previously cash-only payment transactions make way for digital transactions to the extent of 7% of overall transactions.
 
 While the growing trust in these platforms has helped in the move to digital payments, the companies say demonetization provided a significant push. "We saw a 25% jump in payment transactions after demonetization," says Rajiv Tevtiya, CEO of RML AgTech, a platform that provides online agricultural support solutions to farmers, and whose mobile app has seen 12 lakh downloads. About 10% of its payment transactions are now digital.
 
 "A lot of farmers are being forced to learn and use technology-enabled systems. What would have taken three years, we predict it will now take only half the time," says Tevtiya.
 
 Rabindra Nath Verma (66) is based in   in UP and turned to farming just a year ago. He was working previously in a construction company as a supervisor, and was then using internet banking for all his needs including booking railway tickets. So when he had to buy seeds and nutrients for his farming business, choosing internet banking came naturally to him.
 
 Google's online advertising service AdWords, and social media platforms like Facebook have contributed the most to get farmers online. "Almost 45% of all our leads have come through Facebook," says Sidharth Kumar, co-founder of AgriHub, which started as a listing platform for agricultural products for hi-tech farming and which ventured into e-commerce two months ago. BigHaat too sees 90% of its visitors coming through Facebook and Google ads.
 
 Singh of Jalandhar, who has an MA in Punjabi and has been growing potatoes and corn for more than a decade, is among the exceptions. "DuPont Pioneer's agents came to us and told us about the platform that would deliver seeds right to my house. Usually, I would buy untreated seeds at Rs 17,500 a packet. From the online platform, I bought treated seeds for Rs 15,000," he says.
