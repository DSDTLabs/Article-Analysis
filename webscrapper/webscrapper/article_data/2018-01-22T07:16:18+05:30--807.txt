AMRITSAR: To find its lost base and resuscitate its   unit, AAP’s Majha zone unit has decided to launch a year-long mission.

 “The party will begin ‘Majha Strengthening Mission 2019’ from   on February 1, which will continue till February 28, 2019,” said the newly appointed president of  , Majha zone,   while talking to mediapersons here on Sunday.
 
 As part of the mission, he said 750 meetings would be held in 25 assembly constituencies in the entire Majha region and 30 meetings in each constituency would be held with volunteers. “The main aim of these meetings will be to motivate volunteers and also identify 10-15 of them, who will work for expanding the party base in their respective areas” said Dhaliwal. He said the Majha zone was aiming to build up a force of 10,000 dedicated volunteers, who would regularly stay in touch with the public and make people aware about the alleged anti-people policies of the state and central government.
