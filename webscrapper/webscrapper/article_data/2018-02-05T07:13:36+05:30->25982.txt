HYDERABAD: Telangana Joint Action Committee (TJAC) chairman   who once fought a protracted battle for statehood, hand-in-hand with TRS supremo  , is drawing a political blueprint to bring down the KCR-led regime. On Sunday, he announced the launch of his political party to take on TRS in the 2018-19 Assembly and parliamentary polls. While TJAC will continue as a potent apolitical opposition force, the new party will hit the hustings either on its own or as part of a grand alliance. 

 He made the announcement at TJAC's general body meeting at   in Ranga Reddy to a thunderous applause from 4,000 leaders, including state, district, mandal and village-level office-bearers.
 
 TJAC sources said the new political outfit could have one of the three names - Telangana Sakala Jana Party, Telangana Jana Party and Telangana Jana Samithi.
 
 Kodandaram said padayatras and bike rallies will be conducted to strengthen the party at the grassroots and inform people about failures of TRS government. A massive public meeting would be organised in   after the padayatra, he said.
