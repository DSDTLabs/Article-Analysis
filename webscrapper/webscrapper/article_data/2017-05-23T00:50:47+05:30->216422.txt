NEW DELHI: Commuters who use smart cards for   rides may soon get an additional 10% discount on parking charges at DMRC parking lots.   (DMRC) is planning to   the charges at its 96 parking lots where the rates are now Rs 20 for six hours, Rs 30 for 12 hours and Rs 40 for more than 12 hours. 

 DMRC is also planning to upgrade its parking facilities as part of a new policy, under which the Metro smart card will double up as a contact-less card for parking payment. “All new contracts for parking lots will include the provision for automation,” a DMRC spokesperson said. The aim is to encourage genuine commuters to use the parking facilities. DMRC has already hiked parking charges on an experimental basis at   18 station.
 
 When the new policy is implemented, a commuter may get the discount if he collects his vehicle from the parking within 60 minutes of his last exit through an AFC gate in a day. All users will now have to collect their vehicles within 48 hours or it may be sent to the dumping yard. To retrieve it, the customer will have to pay a fine of Rs 500, the actual towing charge incurred by DMRC and the total cost of parking. 
 
 The primary objective will be to inspire commuters to use park-and-ride facilities and curb their misuse by non-Metro users. 
 
 Besides several mechanised facilities (see graphic), the policy will have passenger facilities such as toilets, and clearly marked areas for four- and two-wheelers and cycles as well as differently abled commuters.
