The trailer of  's upcoming movie 'Sakhavu' was out recently and the much-loved young actor appears in two get ups in the film.

 While he looks all charming and happy-go-lucky as Krishnakumar, Sakhavu Krishnan, the other version of him is quite a serious, determined and awe-inspiring personality. After watching the actor in the trailer, there were quite a few interesting reactions on social media platforms. While a few asked him, 'Sakhave, do you want to join the party?' others said 'Uff, what a smile! This is what we waited for.' 'Sakhavu is a combination of kalippu and comedy,' said another.
