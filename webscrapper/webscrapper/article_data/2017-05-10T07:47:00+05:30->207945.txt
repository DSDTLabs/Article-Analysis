GURGAON: Nearly nine months after meat samples were collected from seven streetside biryani sellers in Ferozepur Jhirka in Mewat, a university in Hisar has confirmed that the same belonged to “cow or oxen”.

 In a letter to Mewat’s veterinary department, Hisar’s Lala Lajpat Rai University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences clarified on Monday that the samples tested in the varsity’s laboratory were of “cattle” which refers to “cow or oxen”. 
 
 Earlier the university had only mentioned in its report that “all seven samples are from cattle species”, after the veterinary department of Mewat had sent the samples to the university for testing on August 24, 2016.
 
 The department has sought the latest clarification from the university after an animal rights activist, Naresh Kadyan, filed a complaint at   police station in Delhi’s   area, seeking registration of a ‘zero FIR’ in the case against the seven biryani vendors for selling beef and the veterinary surgeon of Ferozepur Jhirka for not clarifying the varsity’s earlier report.
 
 Kadyan has alleged the officials at Mewat’s veterinary department and the university had not clarified the sample test results due to “political pressure”. “They have cited the pending case in the   and Haryana high court as a reason for not making the reports public, but the court did not issue any stay order in the matter,” said Kadyan.
 
 However, Dr Narendra Singh, deputy director of animal husbandry, Mewat, said the report has been in the public domain since September last year. “The documents were produced even in the Punjab and Haryana HC after a PIL was filed in the matter. Raising the issue now is nothing, but an attempt to disrupt the communal harmony,” said Singh.
 
 When contacted, Bharti Arora , the head of cow protection task force in Haryana, said she wasn’t aware of the matter.
