VADODARA: Residents of Dena village near the city created a ruckus at Dena crossroads on National Highway-8 on Monday morning after two men from the village riding on their motorcycle were knocked down by a car. 

 One of the riders identified as Sanjay Padhiyar died during treatment while the other man Amarsinh Solanki lost his legs. Accused car driver Vijay Acharya, who lives in  , was also injured and is undergoing treatment.
 
 Cops said Acharya has also given an application to register a case against an unidentified truck driver who rammed into his car from back due to which he lost control over his vehicle and knocked down the bikers. Police sources said both Padhiyar and Solanki, who were crossing the road, lost their legs on the spot. They were rushed to SSG Hospital where Padhiyar succumbed to his injuries.
 
 When the residents of Dena village learnt about the accident, they rushed to the spot and blocked the highway demanding either speed-breakers be made near the crossroads or a flyover be constructed. The residents agreed to allow the traffic to pass after senior police officials reached the spot and held a meeting with them.
 
 “They were demanding that speed-breakers be installed before the crossroads on both sides, but National Highways Authority of India does not construct speed-breakers on national highway,” said a police official. The residents then demanded construction of flyover but that is not a viable option since there are already two flyovers over Golden crossroads and Dumad crossroads, police said.
 
 “We then gave them an option that an underpass be created and until then the opening of the crossroads be closed which they have agreed to,” the police official said.
