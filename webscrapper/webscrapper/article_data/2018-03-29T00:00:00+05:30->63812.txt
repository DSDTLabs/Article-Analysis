Ahead of Easter, students of Adarsh Institute of Management and Technology caged themselves in solidarity with hens, that are used on   farms in the form of a silent demo. Eight   sat in   for an hour, in a bid to show what   have to go through. The silent demo, organized by an animal rights group, was held on Brigade Road. In addition to highlighting the misery of the hens, the group also urged passersby to go vegetarian or vegan.

 Radhika Suryavanshi, a member of the group, said, “We want people to know what a miserable life these hens live on an egg  . Very small cages are used for the hens in which they are cooped up and cannot even spread their wings. These hens are used throughout the year to produce eggs and once they stop laying eggs, they are sent to slaughter houses. They lead a miserable life, and as for the male chicks, they are discarded as soon as they are born.”
