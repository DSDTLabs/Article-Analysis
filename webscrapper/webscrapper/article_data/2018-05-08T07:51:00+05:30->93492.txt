CHANDIGARH: By now the students, who are interested in pursuing traditional and professional course at   ( ), are already aware of the fee hike. But did you know that implementing a minimum   fee hike of Rs 750 per annum for all the traditional and professional courses will make the tuition fee of these courses expensive by more than 10%. The minimum hike of Rs 750 for traditional courses with tuition fee ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000 will make these courses expensive by more than 20%. Yes, you read it right.

 
 
  
 
 Take for example the case of BSc (hons). The tuition fee of BSc (hons) course in 2017-18 was Rs 2,820 and the tuition fee for the same course in 2018-19 as per the university’s records will be Rs 3,820. Now, this means an increase of 26% in the tuition fee and not the “10% hike”, which has now been approved by the PU senate.
 
 The fee of MA (humanities) for the 2017-18 academic session was Rs 2,940. However, after the hike, the fee of the same course will be Rs 3,940, which means 25% hike in tuition fee and 15% higher than the approved fee hike. 
 
 “The senate in principal has approved 5% tuition fee hike for the ongoing classes and 10% for the new admissions,” said Parvinder Singh, controller of examinations, PU.
 
 However, the fee structure tabled in the senate and syndicate meeting on Sunday also has certain discrepancies.
 
 The fee structure shows the tuition fee hike of Rs 1,000 as against Rs 750 in all traditional and professional courses. Even if it is a minimum increase of Rs 750 in all traditional courses, the hike turns out to be more than 20% in certain cases. According to the information tabled in the senate, the tuition fee hike for all traditional and professional courses is 10% for both new entrants and ongoing classes.
 
 Earlier, the minimum annual increase for all traditional and professional courses was suggested to be Rs 1,000. However, it was reduced to Rs 750 per annum by a committee constituted by PU vice-chancellor Prof Arun Kumar Grover.
 
 Moreover, earlier the annual enhancement in the tuition fee of University Institute of Applied Management Sciences (UIAMS) was recommended to be Rs 7,500 per annum, but when the committee decided to rationalize the fee structure, the annual hike in the tuition fee of UIAMS was reduced to Rs 6,000.
 
 In fact, the fee structure for the ongoing and new admissions for 2018-19 session circulated in the senate meeting also has a few discrepancies. The fee structure with a minimum increase of Rs 1,000 for the traditional and professional courses, which was earlier recommended but not approved, was tabled in the senate meeting on Sunday.
 
 However, when asked finance development officer (FDO)   about the traditional courses, which have tuition fees ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000, and how the tuition fee hike in these courses comes out to be more than 20%, he said, “The number of such traditional courses is very less.”
