On a sultry Sunday afternoon, hordes of Kolkatans along with their pet buddies, gathered at a south Kolkata address to attend a happening pet pool ‘paw’ty. 
From beagles, Lhasa apsos, golden retrievers, pugs, shih tzus to rabbits — everyone poured in to have a blast at the event. A giant pool, along with colourful inflatable props, was set up for the pets to take a dip in and cool off in this heat. 
 
  
 The   paws dropped in with their human parents to enjoy a plunge and also pose for pictures. Special care was also taken to ensure that all the pets were comfortable and safe in the pool. There were also competitions like the best pet swimmer and the most energetic pet. By the end of the rocking party, each happy pet went home with a bag of goodies. 
 
  
 “A pool is the best way to beat the heat and animals are great natural swimmers. So both the pet and its parents enjoy this event to the hilt,” said  , a pet groomer and the organiser of the party.
