Rajkot: The concrete platform on which two persons had written obscene messages, allegedly desecrating the idol of a god of a particular community, was demolished by the people of Bhagwatpara area in Gondal on Sunday. 

 “The leaders of our community decided to raze the otlo (sit-in) in order to end the controversy. We got an earth mover and demolished it,” said a community member, requesting anonymity.
 
 Two men - Dilip Bawalia and Ranjit Makwana alias Rana, both residents of Bhagwatpara area - were beaten up and paraded half-naked by people for desecrating the idol of their community god on May 24. Police said Dilip and Ranjit had allegedly written obscene text on the platform on which the idol of Lord Madhata was supposed to be placed. On May 24, they were caught red-handed writing the messages. 
 
 “The community members stripped both the youths naked, thrashed them, made them erase the obscene message, paraded them naked before the people and then handed them over to police,” said an official from Gondal city police station. However, the accused and the community members reached a compromise, and hence no official complaint was lodged in the case.
