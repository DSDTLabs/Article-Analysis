Mumbai: The super luxury Scania  , manufactured in  , will now be part of   and 15 such multi-axle vehciles will be introduced on the Mumbai-Pune route from this week.

 Said an MSRTC official: “These are bigger buses with multi-axle, seating capacity of 57, more leg space and more comfort.” The buses will operate under the brand name Ashwamedh. “These will be in addition to the existing Shivneri buses to Pune,” said an official. 
 
 The new buses are being procured on wet lease, which means that the MSRTC will not have to purchase or maintain the buses. “This will reduce the operational costs and also bring in more revenue,” he said, adding, “Due to heavy demand, we are adding 15 Ashwamedh buses and will increase the numbers in the coming weeks. We will also introduce 15 Shivneri   in the next few days.”
 
 On the recent controversy over MSRTC procuring   buses with old emission norms (Euro-III), MSRTC managing director Ranjit Singh Deol clarified that there was nothing wrong in procuring the Euro-III buses. “From April 1, the bus manufacturers have been asked to comply with new rules and manufacture buses with Euro-IV emission. But we can still procure AC buses with the old emission norms,” he said. An official said that buses with Euro-IV norms are costlier.
