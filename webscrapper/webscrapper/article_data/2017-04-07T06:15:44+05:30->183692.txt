PUNE: A sense of déjà vu prevailed over citizens wanting to withdraw cash from ATMs this month.

 Almost one-third of the ATMs are still running dry in the city at a given point in time, just like they did soon after the demonetization announcement on November 8 last year.This is happening even as the   claims to have brought over 70% of pre-demonetisation cash back in circulation.
 
 So, why is the cash situation at ATMs getting worse?
 When asked, an RBI spokesperson told TOI, “There is no shortage of currency supply from our side. There has to be some problem at the banks' end.“
 
 The problem began towards the last week of March and was exacerbated on March 31, 2017, when banks close their accounts for the financial year.The banks stopped giving money to cash logistics companies (responsible for filling up ATMs) as they wanted to close the financial year and show the cash balance on their books, a banker said.
 
 The problem escalated as the banks were closed on April 1 and 2. “We gave some money to the cash management and logistics companies on April 3, but the ATMs ran dry soon after,“ the banker added.
 
 Part of the reason for this high run-off has been the removal of withdrawal limits in place earlier. Also, bankers said, people are not depositing cash back with the branches because they are scared or confused of the Rs 2-lakh rule. “If a trader accepts 100 transactions in cash of Rs 1lakh each (which is allowed), he will have Rs 1 crore. But he is afraid to deposit the money as he fears getting reported,“ another banker said.
 
 To make matters worse, banks charge customers if they transact at ATMs in a nonhome branch network. A banker (who had to run from one   to another) said almost over 80% of the ATMs are out of cash.
