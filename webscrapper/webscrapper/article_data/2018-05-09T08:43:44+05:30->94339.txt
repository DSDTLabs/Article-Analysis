CHANDIGARH: For 17 years, the resident welfare association (RWA) of Sector 32 has been demanding a community centre in the area for weddings and other functions. In the hope of a quicker action, it has decided to take the issue to the   adviser.

 
 Residents claim that about four years ago, a site near Saupin’s School in the sector was identified for the community centre but the authorities concerned shot down the project twice. First they disallowed construction on the grounds that electricity wires lay under the surface, and now the UT chief architect’s office claims that the land is earmarked for commercial booths. Sources in the sector said a mini market was once proposed behind the main   but the project was cancelled on the pretext that the residents don’t want it. Residents question the point of planning a smaller market so near to the main bazar of Sector 32. RWA president   said: “In the absence of a community centre, the association has no venue for meetings with senior officials. The RWA holds its routine meeting at religious places, homes, or educational institutes, if the halls are vacant that day.”
 
 Residents are left to own devices to find sites for ceremonies. In most cases, the venues are outside their budget. If they have no option,   and   or farmhouses for weddings.
