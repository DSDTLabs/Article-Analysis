 is one actress, who manages to woo everyone with her style. Be it her globetrotting adventures, red-carpet events or even her casual looks, the desi girl has kept everyone hooked with her sartorial choices. Yesterday, the actress was spotted at the Mumbai airport and it surely was one of the hottest airport looks ever. 

 
 After completing the season 3 of her American TV show series, PeeCee headed to Dubai for a panel discussion and then made her way to India. Looking stylish as ever, the actress totally slayed in her airport look. She was seen wearing a white turtleneck tee tucked in pastel blue coloured flared pants. A cool colour combination we totally loved on her!

 She styled this look with a white cape jacket over her shoulders and sashayed down the airport. We also loved her white Fendi handbag that complemented the white booties. For this look, she kept her hair sleek with a middle parting and happily posed for the paparazzi.

 Reportedly, the actress is in Mumbai to shoot for several Indian commercials and is also going to sign up a Hindi film. After her big Hollywood stint, the actress might work in Indian cinema after the big, long break. As per the rumours, she's discussing a biopic movie based on late astronaut Kalpana Chawla's life.
