GUWAHATI: Anti-migrant pressure group   (PVM) has decided to launch a statewide signature campaign for a special legislation to protect land rights and jobs of people whose names are mentioned in the   (NRC) of 1951. The PVM said the descendants of these people would be entitled for protection. 

 Alleging that the state government did not have any concrete policy yet to safeguard jaati, maati and bheti (identity, land and homeland), indigenous people are in danger of losing their land to immigrants from Bangladesh, it added. 
 
 "Land is at the root of this infiltration. We have to take the help of law to ensure that identity, land and homeland of indigenous people are protected. That is why we have decided to launch a signature campaign demanding a special law to be passed by the assembly. The law should be such that names of those included in the NRC of 1951 and their descendants are entitled for land, government jobs, business and other activities," said PVM convener  . Hazarika added that the recent evictions launched by the government in different parts of the state should not remain as a 'symbolic' drive only. "The biggest threat to indigenous people is encroachment of their land by Bangladeshi immigrants. Though the present government started eviction drives at several places, it has come to a halt now. We do not want eviction drives to be just symbolic," he said. 
 
 "The government had promised to free over 77,000 bighas of government land at Sipajhar in Darrang district by February 15 this year. But it has remained only a promise," added Hazarika.
 
 The PVM said even the land belonging to   here is being encroached upon by 'suspected citizens'. It demanded that the government should immediately take steps to free the college's land from encroachers.
 
 On Monday, the PVM staged a demonstration here to press for the demand of protecting indigenous people from immigrants.
