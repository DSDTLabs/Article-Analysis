When lyricist-director   set out to make his second film, Bharjari, produced by RS Productions, with  , he knew he had his task cut out for him, considering that the duo had a successful outing with their first collaboration, Bahaddur. “Right with his debut, Addhuri, Dhruva has set certain standards that his fans have come to expect of him — lengthy punchlines that are delivered at train speed, dance sequences with signature steps, and elaborate stunts. When I wrote  , I knew I had to raise it a notch higher to make it even more interesting. With Bharjari, we knew that we had to outdo what we did in Bahaddur. These days, pretty much every actor does the things that Dhruva also does, but not everyone is able to get audiences to say ‘Wow’. Dhruva does that, and hence,   had to have unique moments throughout its runtime,” says Chetan.
Given that Dhruva’s fan following is predominantly youngsters, the director also knew that he had to figure out what would get them to whistle in appreciation for every scene. “Dhruva’s introduction scene sets the tone, and his lines keep up the momentum. This formula applies to the songs and action sequences as well. Choreographer   worked on all our songs and figured out the hook step that would have audiences take notice. The song,  , for instance, has moves that required Dhruva to balance his body weight on his knees. They look easy onscreen, but took a good deal of practice. He was determined to make it work and the results are for all to see,” Chetan signs off.
