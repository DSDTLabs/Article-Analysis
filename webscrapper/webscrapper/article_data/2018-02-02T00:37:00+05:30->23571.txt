Chennai: Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board on Thursday sealed a shopping complex in Purasawalkam for defaulting on water tax for the last 10 years.

 Deensha complex, a four storey building on Ponnappa Street, Purasawalkam, owed the water agency Rs 24 lakh in tax, accrued over the last decade.
 
 Metrowater officials took the owners of the building to the court recently which ruled in favour of the water agency. “Despite the order, they refused to pay the money. So we sealed the building,” said a senior area engineer. He said the building had to pay Rs 32 as water tax every year and Rs 7,800 as water charge.
 
 Officials also sealed a two-storey commercial building in Erukkanchery in North Chennai for arrears to the tune of Rs 59,000.
