NAGPUR: A light morning breeze, the faint rustle of leaves of trees surrounding the venue and the strains of sarod all made for a serene setting at   ( ) at the early   ‘Brahmanaad’ on Sunday. On the stage was young sarod player Amir Khan and accompanying him on tabla was his father  . 

 A good crowd of nearly 300 took seats around the centre garden of the cultural centre where arrangements are made for an Indian style ‘baithak’ and chairs are put outside the periphery of the lawn where the stage is also set for the performance on every second Sunday of the month when this programme is held.
 
 Starting with Mian ki Todi, a late morning raag, Khan captivated the audience with the notes that emerged from his sarod with ease and élan. A seventh generation musician hailing from a family where his grandfather was a much-lauded sarangi player, and who also initiated Khan into the intricacies of the instrument that he wields today, he delivered a recital which was much beyond his 25 years of age. After the expansion of the raga with aalap and jod, he played a tarana in drut ek taal which, he said, was his grandfather’s composition. “I began learning music with   and I usually try to play it during my performances,” he told TOI in a chat later. 
 
 His second presentation was a bandish in the early morning raag Ramkali in teen taal. He brought forth the meditative quality of the raag through the strains of his sarod, creating an atmosphere of utmost calm and quietude, disturbed just once by the light chirping of birds. As the Sun came up, it was time for Khan to wrap up the show with a short composition in raag Charukeshi, much favoured by instrumentalists of both Hindustani and Carnatic music.
 
 Praising the audience and the setting of his performance, Amir said, “I have never seen such a big crowd at an early morning event. This is a perfect sitting and I enjoyed my performance.”
