Chandigarh: Soon, PGI will digitise all PhD and MD/DM dissertations to generate a database and also prevent  . At present, these theses are stored as hardcopies in the library, but there is no backup for the same.

 “Once all the dissertations are digitised, we will not only be able to securely store the authentic works, but also generate a database to check plagiarism,” said Dr Rajesh Kumar, dean academics, PGI.
 
 Several incidents of plagiarism witnessed at the institute had compelled the authorities to frame guidelines last year. For theses, the maximum similarity acceptable is 17%, while for in the case of publications, the same is up to 12% or as per the publication or publisher’s guidelines of the respective journals and not more than 2-3% from a single source. Panjab University accepts overall similarity index up to 20%.
 
 Every year, PGI receives as many as 1,100 publications which have to be scanned under certified software that checks plagiarism. “We have provided Turnitin software to the library and to the faculty members who supervise research work,” said Dr Kumar.
 
 PGI has made it mandatory that while submitting a thesis, a student will be required to get a certificate from the library.
 
 Most of the educational institutions use paid softwares. “We have both Urkund and Turnitin. Urkund is free as we are registered under the UGC for it. The faculty members are authorized to use the software to check for plagiarism,” said Neeraj Kumar, assistant librarian, Panjab University.
 
 However, every software gives a different rating and the results may not be exhaustive. Prof Tavpritesh Sethi, visiting professor at Stanford medicine, US, said, “I have had cases where Urkund showed only 4% similarity to previous documents whereas I was able to pull the text verbatim,” adding, “The best option is using multiple softwares, however, the high price factor can make it difficult.”
