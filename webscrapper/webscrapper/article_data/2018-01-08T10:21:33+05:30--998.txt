RAIPUR: Chhattisgarh has shown great promise after becoming full BCCI member. Last year, they recorded victory in their first match   match and created the history. They could have won their four matches, which they lost closely.

 Chhattisgarh have shown they don’t care about the reputation of the opposition. Bowling coach   is confident of a good show against   in their opening match of Central Zone   Twenty20 Trophy match here at Shaheed Veer Narayan Syadium in Naya Raipur on Monday. After all, they have beaten Vidarbha in their previous two meetings in both longer and shortest formats.
 
 “We are the newest team in the domestic circuit. All other teams are experienced so there’s no point caring about the reputation. It’s always good to go with the plain mind. Of course, Vidarbha would be much confident after their Ranji Trophy victory but this is a different game and different format. We have beaten them twice in two meetings and there’s no reason why we can’t do it again,” Krishnakumar, a former Rajasthan captain, told TOI on Sunday.
 
 Krishnakumar is aware of Vidarbha’s potential. “They are a talented and well-balanced side. I feel Jitesh (Sharma) has an ex-factor. He is a match-winner. Apoorv (Wankhade) has also done well for them. They have experienced players in Karn (Sharma), Faiz (Fazal) and (Ganesh) Satish. Karn must be eager to play. He has plenty of experience and has been part of champion IPL sides,” Krishnakumar said.
 
 Krishnakumar, who has also worked with Vidarbha Under-19 pacer   at Zonal Cricket Academy, knows Vidarbha’s confidence is high after their Ranji Trophy victory. “The process was started by Sulakshan Kulkarni seven years ago. Vidarbha were without professionals then and have gone from strength to strength under Paras Mhambrey. However, Chandu (Chandrakant Pandit) Bhai has made the difference. He is a go getter. Vidarbha has played some exciting cricket this season,” he said.
