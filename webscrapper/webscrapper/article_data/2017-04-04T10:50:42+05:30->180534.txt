LUCKNOW: Close to 250 faculty   at   (KGMU) are lying  , affecting   in university hospitals with over 2,500 beds. 

 The maximum impact is being borne by trauma and emergency care services where the university accepts it is not able to provide “constant care”. Under these, the worst hit are the departments of surgery, neurosurgery, orthopedics and medicine, where almost half of the   posts are vacant.
 
 The university has 652 sanctioned faculty posts of which 411 are filled in and 243 are vacant for several months. 
 
 The gap is being filled in by junior and senior residents, who are working for more than stipulated hours of duty. 
 
 “Shortage of capable hands with seats lying vacant is a big problem,” said Prof Ravi Kant, vice chancellor KGMU VC. “Our casualty services see a sudden high and sometimes a dip which is to be rectified since a constant level of service should be maintained. We have decided to create a pool in every department to work on rotation every eight hours apart from their routine, even if that is more than the 80 hours of required duty work in a week,” said the VC. 
 
 Experts said the shortage arises because talent goes to private sector with its higher number of PG specialization seats and high salaries.
