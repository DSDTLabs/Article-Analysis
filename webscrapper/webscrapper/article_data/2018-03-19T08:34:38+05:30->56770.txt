CHANDIGARH:   (PU) has received more than 10 complaints of sexual harassment against the faculty member of Dr   already facing a probe in one such case. 

 Sources said the complaints include hand-written applications and typed communication. All of them are anonymous. The students have also submitted screenshots of the "objectionable content sent by the faculty member to them".
 
 "We have received more complaints against the faculty member. We have forwarded their complaints to PUCASH," said Prof Meenakshi  . Sources said the complainants have also submitted videos that the faculty member allegedly sent them. According to sources, it was around three years back when some students had approached their head of the department alleging sexual harassment by the faculty member. Although there was strong evidence against him, the complaints were resolved at the department-level.
 
 On March 15, PU VC   along with Malhotra visited the institute and scrutinized feedback forms. They had attached the feedback forms mentioning the sexual harassment complaints by some other students against the same professor with the main complaint copy. There were complaints against the faculty member in the complaint box at the institute. A meeting with faculty members of the institute was also convened where the question was raised that despite having many women faculty members, why didnt' the students approach them first.
