MUMBAI: Arthur Road   may soon be able to lose its tag of being just another Indian jail with “poor conditions,” as controversial businessman Vijay Mallya’s defence team in a UK court described the place while resisting India’s attempts to extradite him and the government’s plan to lodge him in barrack number 12. Next week, it will become the first prison in Maharashtra to have a full-fledged   for undertrials housed there.

 The gym, jail officials said, will be equipped with all the key equipment. There is one marked difference from a regular gym, though: it will have no loose dumb-bells or other unattached equipment made of iron. All the equipment will be attached to machines. This is because cement blocks used in the past by some prisoners as dumb-bells were once used in an assault.
 
 For those who just can’t do without dumb-bells, the authorities will provide water bottles filled only with  , which they can use as a substitute to pump iron.
 
 “Such bottles containing salt are provided even now, so we are not worried,” said jail superintendent Harshad Ahirrao. The gym will have two professional trainers, he added.
 
 The demand for the gym came from the undertrials themselves, said jail officials, who feel it could also work as a stress-buster for the   who live in an overcrowded space. While the sanctioned strength of prisoners at this 1925-built prison is 804, at any given time the inmate population is more than 2,800. 
 
 The gym will be able to accommodate 20-25 prisoners in each 45-minute session. As of now, many fitness-conscious inmates work out in their own barracks. While they can now go to the gym, a decision to allow hardened criminals and gangsters lodged in the high-security cells to use the facility is yet to be taken due to security reasons.
