 has been surprising his fans by introducing new characters on his show. After getting Sanju Baba's lookalike on   and stand up comedians like Raju Shrivastav, Sunil Pal and Ahsan Qureshi, Sony TV has more surprise in story for the audience.
 
  Their official handle tweeted a picture from the show saying someone is going to come to Kapil's "Mohalla".
  
  The tweet read as, "Koi aa raha hai Kapil ke mohalle mein apni kalakari ka dhamaka karne. Stay tuned to know what's going to happen in #TheKapilSharmaShow."
  
  
  
  Kapil Sharma has been trying to woo audience with not just his antics eversince his fall out with  , Chandan Prabhakar and Ali Asgar.
  
  Last week, veteran comedians Raju Shrivastav, Sunil Pal and Ahsan Qureshi were a part of The Kapil Sharma Show but failed to impress and people could be seen missing their favourite Dr Mashoor Gulati and Ribnku Bhabhi.
  
  
  recently when the former hurled abuses at the latter during their flight back home from Australia.
  
  Sunil later wrote an open letter to Kapil post that, requesting him to start respecting humans. Despite a public apology by Kapil, Sunil seems in no mood to forgive and shoot for The Kapil Sharma Show.
  
  Sunil continues to boycott the show and has not resumed shooting post their ugly spat.
