NEW DELHI: India will enter a new era in higher education on Sunday with the launch of hundreds of courses that will be delivered through DTH channels, tablets and mobiles. 

  These courses have been developed by over 1,000 expert faculty members from premier institutions like IITs, JNU,   and Anna University. 
 
  A 'Made in India' IT platform - MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses), or   - will host courses taught in classrooms from Class IX to postgraduation, which can be accessed by anyone, anywhere at any time. All the courses are interactive and available free of cost. Students from various recognised institutes in India will be able to earn credits on clearing these online courses. 
 
  President   will launch Swayam, Swayam Prabha - the platform of 32 DTH channels to deliver the courses - and National Academic Depository (NAD) which will facilitate online verification of certificates. 
 
 Swayam aims at taking the best teaching-learning resources to all, bridge the digital divide for students who have hitherto remained untouched by the digital revolution and have not been able to join the mainstream of the knowledge economy. 
 
  The courses hosted on Swayam will be in four quadrants -video lecture, specially prepared reading material that can be downloaded/printed, self-assessment tests through tests and quizzes and an online discussion forum for clearing doubts. 
 
  The scheduled courses include engineering, management, science, humanities, language and mathematics. There are also self-paced courses like critical thinking and contemporary themes on Indian economy. 
 
  'Swayam Prabha' is conceived as a group of 32 DTH channels devoted to telecasting high-quality educational programmes on 24X7 basis using GSAT-15 satellite. Every day, there will be new content for at least four hours which would be repeated five more times in a day.
