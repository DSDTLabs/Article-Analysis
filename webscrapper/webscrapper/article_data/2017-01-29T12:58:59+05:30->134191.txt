 Khodke’s experience in administrative work at Mantralaya, contributions to social causes and good knowledge of issues concerning teachers, educated unemployed and graduates make him a strong contender. 
 
 An agriculture graduate, Khodke feels that he will win on the strength of votes in Amravati alone. Excerpts from an interview ...
 
 
 
 
 A. From 1984 to 1991, I worked in various departments at Mantralaya on deputation. I tried to solve problems of   and the needy. I joined active politics in 2009. Then I decided to contest teachers’ constituency polls but I was advised not to do so as the constituency is confined only to teachers who are small in number. Then I thought of contesting graduates’ constituency. My want to solve issues of graduates, curb unemployment and exploitation in higher education. 
 
 
 
 
 A. In 2010, he won against BT Deshmukh of NUTA because Congress-NCP supported India Bulls in its drive against BT. It was a mistake made by these parties. But Patil did not remain loyal to the graduates. On the contrary, as a state home minister, he ordered lathi charge on teachers at Aurangabad. He did not care to attend to university’s issues and lost his membership to senate. He remained more focused on attending to CM than his constituency. 
 
 
 
 
 A. I think it is the negative attitude of this government towards teachers. Out of the 76,000 voters registered in Amravati, I have registered 32,000 here and a very good number in other parts of the district. I will match Patil vote for vote in Akola.
