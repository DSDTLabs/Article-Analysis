Ahmedabad: The Surat district court on Tuesday issued a public notice and prohibited publication of any news related to court cases without court’s prior permission, for the court believes that unconfirmed news damages dignity of the judiciary.

 The public notice also says that if a journalist publishes any news without court’s permission, action will be initiated against him as per the law.
 
 The principal district judge Geeta Gopi issued the public notice saying, “Reporters publish baseless information in newspapers without obtaining permission from the court. This damages the dignity of the judiciary. This is not proper.”
 
 The notice further reads, “This is to inform all journalists and news reporters through this public notice that no news pertaining to a court matter should be published in newspaper or run on news channels without court’s permission. If one fails to follow this, action will be initiated against the concerned person in accordance with law.”
 
 Sources said that the principal district judge imposed the blanket ban on news reporting on court matters by citing an alleged misreporting by a daily in connection with a bail application. The news led to levelling of allegations by the parties involved and the judge felt that the court’s image was being tarnished.
 
 When contacted, Gujarat high court’s registrar general P R Patel confirmed about issuance of the public notice. He said, “There is no question of barring publication of news based on records and court proceedings. The principal district judge may have thought of restricting the coverage of news that are unconfirmed and baseless and such news normally leads to grievance on part of the parties involved.”
 
 In various cases, courts impose ban on publication of news on specific cases by passing judicial orders. The courts also restrict entry of news-persons in courtrooms by making the proceedings in-camera in sensitive matters as well as in cases related to sexual abuse.
