HYDERABAD: In a city where more than half the population owns two-wheelers,   are the most targeted by  . Every year, over 1,000   are stolen in Hyderabad. From 2011 to 2015, as many as 6,301 cases of two-wheeler theft were registered, more than 15 times that of four-wheeler theft (407 cases) and almost 50 times the cases of   (131). Once stolen, a vehicle can be considered gone for good. Recovery is low, at merely 25-30% of thefts. Lack of parking space adds to the ease with which the crime is committed.

 The data, released recently by the   (NCRB), shows that two-wheeler thefts decreased from 2014 to 2015, but that cannot be considered to be a trend, as figures for the previous years fluctuate. The year 2011 had 1,543 cases, which decreased significantly by 23% to 1,183 in 2012, then rose by 2% to 1,212 in 2013, and rose again, by 8%, to 1,311 in 2014. From 2014 to 2015, when 1,052 cases were registered, the fall was significant -about 20%.
 
 The police say bikes and scooters are the easiest to steal and sell as scrap or even as used vehicles, typically attracting entry-level criminals, sometimes minors as well. “Not only are gangs involved in the thefts, even college students have been caught. Some steal bikes for the fun of going on a ride, while others want to show off before peers,“ said Rama Rao Nigidala, circle inspector (in-charge, auto theft cases).
 
 A few years ago, a lawyer's son killed himself after getting caught stealing a motorcycle. He was angry that his father had refused to buy him a bike, while his friends would flaunt theirs.
 
 Unlike two-wheeler theft, which has gone up and down in the period under consideration, four-wheeler theft has more or less steadily declined. Though it went up from 2011 (105 cases) to 2012 (121 cases), it fell in the following years to 77, 65 and 39.
 
 The police attribute the decline in theft to resale difficulties and increased security measures such as the presence of over 350 CCTV cameras in the city.
 
 Vehicle theft cases fell by 31 per cent from 2011 (1,742) to 2015 (1,194). This followed a brief spike in 2014 (1,449 cases) after two years of decline in 2013 (1,353) and 2012 (1,370).
 
 That said, the city still has the highest number of vehicle theft cases (all categories put together) in the southern region. With 7,108 vehicles stolen in five years, Hyderabad fares much worse than Vijayawada (3,089), Visakhapatnam (1,787) and Kochi (468). Overall, it ranks 10th in the country, with Delhi (93,342), Bengaluru (26,565) and Mumbai (19,491) in the top slots.
 
 On the low recovery of stolen vehicles, Nigidala says they are quickly taken apart and sold to scrap dealers. “Scrap dealers buys stolen vehicles for dirt cheap.The thieves really get a paltry sum,“ he says. “A stolen vehicle can theoretically be traced by its chassis and engine numbers, but in reality, that is an impossible task.“
