Jabalpur: Madhya Pradesh high court on Tuesday dismissed the petitions by five petitioners accused in the disproportionate asset case along with former IAS officers   and his wife  , challenging government action against them.

 They objected to the cases registered against them and action relating to attachment of their properties.
 
 A total of 11 accused in the case including the Joshi couple had filed a petition challenging the government action. But, three petitionersâ€” including the Joshi couple requested the court to withdraw their petitions after five of the petitions were dismissed and the hearing in three remaining petitions is scheduled after three weeks. 
 
 The petitioners had informed court in their petitions, since the action of attaching their properties has been taken, they cannot be tried under a criminal case simultaneously. Citing the Supreme Court orders, the division bench of high court comprising justice S K Gangele and justice A K   informed the petitioners that simultaneous action could be taken in these types of cases.
 
 It is worth mentioning that the terminated IAS couple Arvind and Tinoo Joshi hit the headlines after lokayukta raids in 2010 unearthed disproportionate assets from their home.
