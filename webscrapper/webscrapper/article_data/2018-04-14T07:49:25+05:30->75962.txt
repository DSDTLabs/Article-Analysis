KOLKATA: After repeated accidents involving cyclists, especially around Eastern Metropolitan Bypass and  , cops are planning to increase the fine amount for performing stunts on road from Rs 100 to Rs 1000. According to cops, the proposal needs   do not need licence. 

 "A proposal in this regard has been drafted. Our legal cell is studying its implications to understand whether such provisions can be imposed under the existing laws," said a highly placed officer at Lalbazar. 
 
 Police sources said they will also study the rules in place at other cities of India. The present laws do not allow cops to fine more than Rs 100 in case of cyclists breaking traffic laws.
 
 Several cyclists across the city questioned the move and said no other traffic offence invites such a high fine for the first offence. 
 
 "This is just another way of making the cycling an unpopular action. It will be up to the cop's interpretation to decide if someone is performing a stunt,"claimed one of the cycle enthusiasts, who played a key role in lifting the freeze imposed on  's 100-odd routes. 
 
 Cops said that they would like to cover stunt-cycling under negligence on roads. "Riding without the hands on handle and brake, zipping in and out of a lane, riding on pavements and speeding by hoisting oneself above the seat are some simple offences that we think can be life threatening not only for the riders but even for others on the road.
 
 "We get regular complaint that the behaviour of a very few cyclists are   and  , who have a right to feel safe on the footpaths and roads. The sad fact is with fewer policemen and civic volunteers out on the beat to enforce the rules, it is us who are targeted," said an officer-in-charge from a traffic guard located in east Kolkata.
