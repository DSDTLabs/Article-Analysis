With a line-up of two big multi-specialty hospitals — Indo-UK collaborative hospital and   (  at  ) — four in the government sector and few in the private sector,   is expected to get a major boost in 2018.

 Construction of big projects like AIIMS (Bibinagar) and the four hospitals in four corners of the city (each planned with 750 beds) is likely to begin during the year.
 
 Apart from infrastructure, medical technology and use of robots in performing high-precision surgeries are expected to increase in the city. While the city already has a few centres using advanced technologies, many more private hospitals are lining up for bringing robots, say sources.
 
 Also, many hospitals will adopt technology-driven care and patient management. “Healthcare will witness a bigger role of digital technology and machine learning. The rapidly advancing technologies will show signs of percolation into practices like drug discovery, clinical decision making, patient diagnosis, precision medicine, medical research and development and clinical decision-making.
 
 “There will be an increase in the usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning, starting 2018,” said Probir Das, director,  .
 
 The mobile health services will continue to get more patients. With a plethora of apps being launched, citizens’ health awareness levels will continue to rise.
 
 More transplantations are likely to be performed with the state-run hospitals being geared up with infrastructure and training for the purpose.
 
 2018 will be a good time for healthcare professionals as nearly 10,000 new posts of doctors, nurses and paramedics (recently created by the state government) will be filled.
 
 With the state health department focussing on improving human resources, setting up 40 dialysis centres and 20 intensive care units, which are in the pipeline, the government-run facilities will be able to cater to many more patients, especially from the lesser privileged sections.
