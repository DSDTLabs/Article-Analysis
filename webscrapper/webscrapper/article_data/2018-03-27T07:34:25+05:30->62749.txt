AHMEDABAD: Last year, the state government was compelled to redesign the ecosensitive zone around   after the   high court took suo motu cognizance of a letter complaining about encroachment by hospitality units. After the high court took a tough stance on hospitality units operating illegally, the state government forced the closure of many hotels and lodging places in Junagadh, Amreli, and   districts.

 The state government had to apply strict measures in granting development permissions in the buffer zone. However, following a protest by local people, the state government modified its plan and came up with a final notification which aimed to reduce the buffer zone around the sanctuary. The government faced allegations that the reduction in the buffer zone was meant to benefit mining and tourism industries. However, the HC asked tough questions to the state government with regard to the reduced buffer zone.
