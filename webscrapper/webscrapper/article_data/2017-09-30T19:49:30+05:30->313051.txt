AGRA: A   traveling in sleeper class of North East Express from   to   was assaulted and robbed by gang of college-going students over berth dispute.

 The newly recruited   of   (SSB) who had a confirmed berth in S5 coach, claimed, that there were 16 youths including 6 girls, who were without reservation.
 
 “I was having a confirmed middle berth and was traveling alone. Since the berth (5) was next to the entrance door of coach, scores of passengers without reservation boarded the train and sat on it. Initially, I adjusted with the youths assuming that they would alight after an hour or so, but they didn’t. I don’t know from where they boarded the train, but couple of hours later when I asked them to leave the berth, they refused. When I confronted them, a youth slapped me after which another one grabbed my neck. They humilated me and threw me near the lavatory,” said   of SSB.
 
 A resident of Agra, the jawan said, “Since I was alone, I thought to get help from TTE or police squad of the train, but I couldn’t get any. Later when train reached Kanpur central station, the gang alighted and also took my luggage along with my wallet which had Rs 10,000 cash. I felt helpless as train departed Kanpur 3 minutes later before I could reach GRP station. I boarded the train again and alighted at Tundla. I informed GRP about the incident.”
 
 Station officer of Tundla, Sarvendar Kumar Sharma said, “We have filed an FIR based on the victim’s complaint against the unknown people. Since the incident took place near Kanpur, the FIR will be forwarded to Kanpur GRP.”
 
 Police have levied IPC sections 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 379 (punishment for theft).
