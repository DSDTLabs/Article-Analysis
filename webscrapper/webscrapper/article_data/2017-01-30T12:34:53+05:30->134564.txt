PANAJI: Asserting that the   would ensure that off-shore casinos were removed from the Mandovi river, AAP chief ministerial candidate Elvis Gomes alleged that granting   to operate in the river amounted to a scam.

 “I am sure that there is something wrong because these casinos have been allowed to operate in inland waters. My fear is that some mischief has been done. These are basically director general of shipping certified vessels. They have to take licenses from them, not from captain of ports,” Gomes said while outlining AAP’s strategy to remove the casinos.
 
 Except for   (MGP) and   (MGP), every other political party contesting the elections on February 4 has promised to stop casinos. However, none of the parties have outlined how they plan to shift the off-shore casinos, something the BJP had promised to do in 2012, but later backtracked.
 
 “The moment the casinos go to director general of shipping, they will fail the tests because there are over 27 tests and different licenses that they have to obtain and they want to avoid it. That is why they are taking the shelter of captain of ports. I am sure that if that is implemented, the vessels will go,” the former bureaucrat said.
 
 Gomes, who served as the captain of ports in Goa, also stated that the Congress had no right to talk about removing casinos as the party was responsible for introducing gambling in Goa. Gomes said that Congress introduced off-shore casino vessels into the state without any mention of such a plan in their poll manifesto for 1999.
 
 “The BJP intentionally failed to remove the casinos and that is why they are not talking about the issue,” Gomes said.
 
 AAP, Gomes added, was willing to forego the Rs1500 crores revenue generated by the casino industry if it could prevent Goa being projected as a gambling or sex destination.
