CHANDIGARH: Taking on AAP MLA Sukhpal   for his alleged malicious campaign against Rana Sugar Mills, Rana Inder Pratap, son of former power minister and Congress MLA Rana Gurjit Singh has warned the leader of the Opposition against accusing Rana Sugar Mills of releasing effluents in a drain falling into Beas.

 Inder Partap is the managing director of Rana Sugar Mill.
 
 Khaira, on May 27 had tried to inspect the drain near the mill in Butter Seviyan village. However, he and his supporters were stopped by the local police from carrying out the inspection. Khaira had later alleged that Rana Sugar Mill was responsible for creating water pollution in the drain that fell into Beas.
 
 Addressing media persons on Tuesday, Inder Partap questioned Khairaâ€™s authority to inspect his mill. Inder Partap said Khaira had earlier approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on the same issue and then had come to the mill for verifying the facts. He claimed his mill was not involved in any kind of pollution and that it got its pollution control certificate every year by the Punjab Pollution Control Board.
 
 He said the water is recycled and reused in the mill itself. He added that molasses were sold in the market and no chemical or polluted water was being released by his mill in any river-drain or canal.
