PANAJI:   is preparing to file a disqualification petition against   before the speaker of the House. During the crucial floor test in the assembly on Thursday, Rane, who was elected from the Valpoi constituency, left the   after being administered his oath by protem speaker Siddharth Kuncalienker, reducing the Congress’ strength to 16 MLAs in the 40-member House.

 “The petition is almost ready. We have sought the advice of senior Congress functionaries Kapil Sibal and Abhishek Singhvi. A legal opinion was also sought in a bid to strengthen our case,” a Congress official said.
 
 As per Article 191 of the Constitution, the grounds for disqualification of sitting MLAs includes an instance wherein the MLA in question defies the party whip. If accepted and proved, the MLA attracts disqualification and is debarred from contesting polls for the next six years.
 
 “Vishwajit signed the whip. A breach of whip incurs disqualification and the act preceded his resignation,” a source said.
 
 Based on the chronology of events, political observers and legal experts say Rane’s move to file his resignation before the disqualification petition was filed creates a grey area. 
 
 The fact that Rane’s resignation was accepted by a protem speaker has also raised doubts on whether Kuncalienker could accept the resignation letter. A lawyer said that it has to be accepted by a speaker and not by a protem speaker.
