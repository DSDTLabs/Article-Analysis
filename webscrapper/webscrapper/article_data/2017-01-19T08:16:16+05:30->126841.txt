KOLKATA: A 19-year-old  , apparently a drug-addict, bludgeoned his   to death-bashing her face 18-19 times-when she refused to give in to his demand of handing over Rs 50,000 she had in a fixed deposit. 

 The accused, Prakash Chakraborty, was arrested for murder after his father lodged a complaint.
 
 Prakash reportedly started taking drugs four years ago, after his mother died. A resident of Chingrihata Lane in the Tangra police station area, Prakash's father, Mithu Chakraborty, works at a nearby dhaba. When Mithu returned home around 1.30am on Wednesday, he found his son sitting on a chair, and his mother, Chhaya Chakraborty (70), lying on the floor, covered in blood. Mithu called the police.
 
 "The accused, Prakash, has been arrested for murder. The victim's body bore multiple injuries," said JCP (crime) Vishal Garg.
 
 The Chakrabortys, survived on Mithu's meagre income and lived at a rented house. Since his mother passed away, Prakash, who studied in Class XII at Sarat Chandra Sur High School, shared a room with his grandmother. 
 
 On Tuesday night Prakash learnt about his grandmother's fixed deposit of Rs 50,000 and asked her for the entire amount. But knowing his addiction, she refused to give him anything. Enraged, Prakash hit her multiple times with whatever he could lay his hands on, the police said. "Her face was bashed in, being hit by heavy as well as light objects at least 18-19 times. We are looker for his drug-peddlers as well," the police said.
