Mumbai: The Mumbai airport got its first   under the Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik ( ) scheme with low-cost carrier   Jet connecting   and   with direct flights to the city this week. One of the key concerns about the regional connectivity scheme ( ) which aims to air connect non-metros to metros is the lack of new slots in congested airports like Mumbai, Delhi.

 “The ministry of civil aviation had asked for 20 slots at Mumbai airport for the UDAN scheme, but because of air traffic congestion we could provide only eight,” said an airport source adding that other than Spice Jet, Hyderabad-based low-cost regional carrier Trujet is expected to connect Mumbai to Nanded under the scheme. 
 
 The first flight under the RCS scheme, popularly known as UDAN scheme, was launched in Delhi by Air India’s Alliance Air two months ago with the launch of turbo prop flights to Shimla. On Monday, Spice Jet brought Mumbai onto the UDAN radar with a 9.30 am Mumbai-Porbander and a 1.05 pm Mumbai-Kandla flight. Spice was awarded six proposals and 11 routes under the first phase of the scheme. “Out of the six proposals, four will cater to unserved markets of Adampur, Kandla, Puducherry and Jaisalmer whereas two will be for underserved markets of Porbandar and Kanpur,” said Spice Jet. 
 
 Under the RCS scheme, fares on 50% seats on an hour-long flights of approximately 500 kms are capped at Rs 2,500. To tide over the losses thereof, the government offers airlines concessions and viability gap funding. The remaining seats though would be sold at market price. Porbander and Kandla are 445 kms and 520 kms respectively from Mumbai and all the to and fro flights, except the Porbander-Mumbai leg come under the RCS scheme. The all-inclusive starting fare on Porbander-Mumbai begins at Rs 3100, while for the other routes its Rs 2250 or Rs 2500.
