PATNA: The inquiry team probing the Sabbalpur diara   that claimed 24 lives on Saturday, has begun the documentation exercise for drafting its report.

 The team, comprising principal secretary (disaster management)   and DIG (central range) Shalin, is expected to submit its report to the state government by the end of this month. “We have started compiling our report based on our investigation so far. We are looking into all possible aspects and responsibility of various agencies,” Pratyaya told TOI on Wednesday.
 
 He said the inquiry team was also verifying whether or not the personnel deputed at the sandbar on the fateful day were actually at work. “We are perusing their call records and mobile location,” said Pratyaya.
 
 Sources said the probe team is investigating the kite festival-related documents procured from the Patna and Saran district administration as well as the tourism department to check whether the standard operating procedure for organising such events was followed. On Tuesday, it inspected the spot and questioned the officials concerned.
 
 The probe team is also learned to have taken possession of the log books of CL Kasturba of the   and MV Kautilya of the  , which were used to ferry people from Gandhi Ghat to Sabbalpur diara where the corporation had organised the kite festival. 
 
 The two ships, which ferried people for free, reportedly stopped operating from 4pm. The resultant panic among people led to overcrowding of private boats. One of these private boats sank in the Ganga, claiming 24 lives.
 
 Meanwhile, according to Patna district transport officer Ajay Kumar, there are 122 registered private boats in the district. “The DM has directed the SDOs to conduct a fresh survey of unregistered boats and inspect them for the purpose of issuing licence upon compliance with the rules,” Kumar said.
