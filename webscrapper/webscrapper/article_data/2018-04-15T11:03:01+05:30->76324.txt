COIMBATORE: Close on the heels of a protest call by Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnerta Kazhagam, Coimbatore Central Prison authorities on Saturday sanctioned six days parole to the convict in the 1998 serial bomb blast case, I Abu Dhahir, who has been suffering from the autoimmune disease called Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.

 A member of the banned Al-Umma outfit, Abu Dhahir was initially sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for his involvement in the 1998 serial bomb blast in the city. After serving the sentence, he was sentenced to life term by a Madurai court in 2003 for murdering assistant jailor Jayaprakash there in August 29, 1997.
 
 However, down with the autoimmune disease, Abu Dhahir was on and off under treatment.
 
 Based on a Madras high court order, Abu Dhahir was sent on month-long parole from March 7, 2018, and he was admitted to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital. After the parole period, he was taken back to the prison hospital. As his health condition deteriorated, members of Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnerta Kazhagam announced plans to stage a massive protest in front of the prison for his release.
 
 The prison authorities, however, granted him six days parole, starting Saturday, and shifted him to the   and Hospital on Avinashi Road.
 
  State president of Manithaneya Makkal Katchi, M H  , and its functionaries also met the city police commissioner, K Periaiah, seeking Abu Dhahir’s release.
 
 “The high court has already ordered the state government to release Abu Dhahir. But the Edappadi Palaniswami’s government did not implement the court order. It is contempt of court. Palaniswami’s government will be the responsible if anything happens to Abu Dhahir,” Jawahirullah said.
