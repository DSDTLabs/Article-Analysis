MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Tuesday said a special wing of the police is necessary for serious crimes like rape and murder so that investigation is completed in time. 

 "Timely investigation in such cases and other criminal cases is the need of the hour,'' said a bench of Justices Naresh   and  , adding that there must be "zero pendency'' in investigation where minor girls are victims.
 
 On April 9 it allowed the petition of a 13 year old rape survivor to abort her 24 week pregnancy and lamented the loss of precious time as police delayed informing about it. The girl was abducted from Kalyan in July 2017 by a labourer 10 years older to her. She was rescued by an NGO on March 15, 2018.
 
 Government's advocate   said while initially the accused was only charged with kidnapping, rape and other sections of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act was subsequently applied.
 
 The judges noted that FIR was filed in July but the accused was nabbed only last month. They questioned why the police did not act fast. When the law and courts are taking such matters seriously, the police is taking it lightly.''
 
 The judges then said it there must be two wings of police, one for law and order and another for probing serious crimes including rape, murder and other women related offence. "High time you have special investigation wing. Not sent for any other job,'' said Justice Patil, lamenting that police are busy on bandobast and so many activities and have no time for investigations. The bench said superior officers must monitor progress of investigation till filing of chargesheet
