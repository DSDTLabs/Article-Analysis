MUMBAI: The state government has asked the Centre to provide details of the criteria based on which universities across the country were rated, higher and technical educaition minister   said in the legislative assembly on Thursday. He added that the state government will study the shortt comings and work on them to improve the rating of Mumbai University.

 To another question,   said the government would institute a committee to recommend how to ensure neighbourhood schooling so that students do not have to travel far to study. When legislators   and   pointed out that students in their constituencies could not study in reputed colleges in the area and have to travel to colleges in the suburbs, Tawde said admission is centralized and based on merit. If neighbourhood students are to be given priority, then it would be a disservice to the meritorious students, he added.
 
 The assembly also passed the Sanjay Ghodawat University Bill, 2017, under which a private university will be set up in Kolhapur.
