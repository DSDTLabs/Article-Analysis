Coimbatore: RS Puram police station will be officially recognised as one among the best three Smart police stations in the country on Saturday. The award will be handed over to the station housing officer, T Jothi, at a function to be held at the Border Security Force (BSF) Academy at Tekanpur in Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh. It was the ministry of home affairs that introduced the concept of Smart (S for sensitive and strict, M for modern with mobility, A for alert and accountable, R for reliable and responsive and T for trained and techno savvy) stations. Subsequently, Bureau of Police Research and Development prepared the plan for building such police stations across India. Tamil Nadu government suggested two police stations - Anna Nagar in Chennai and RS Puram (B2) in Coimbatore - for the project. The Union government then fixed some norms for the model stations. According to sources, the RS Puram station was selected after completing the assessment rates of recovery of properties, crime detection, cleanliness, rain water harvesting and recovery of properties etc. The station has an exclusive room for visitors, a waiting hall and a receptionist cabin. The all-woman police wing has set up a cr√®che, which the petitioners can make use for their children.
