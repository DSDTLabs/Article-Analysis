COLVA: The   ambitious plan to upgrade   with a 225 m extension and improvement to sanitation has hit a roadblock with   denying the issuance of any approvals for the work.

 While Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA) and   have issued stop work notices to the department’s 400m wall to regulate sand deposition at the mouth of Sal river, the Cutbona project has run into controversy over non-issuance of no objection certificate (NOC) by Velim panchayat.
 
 Melwyn Sanches, sarpanch of Velim panchayat, confirmed that his office has not issued any NOC to the fisheries department. “Fishing is a purely commercial activity but the panchayat is not receiving any revenue from trawlers as the department says it is a farming activity,” he said.
 
 The jetty extension envisages increasing the length by 225m and breadth by 11.20m along River Sal. The existing approach roads, power and water supply will be improved and public restrooms will be built at a cost of 29.36 crore.
 
 Sanches further said that the panchayat had issued a provisional NOC in 2013 but it has already lapsed. In 2016, after the panchayat body meeting and gram sabha, the panchayat wrote to the department to obtain requisite NOC/permissions for the proposed works.
 
 A visit to Cutbona jetty showed that the work was in progress. When this was pointed out to Sanches, he said that he would inform other members and take a decision in the matter.
 
 Director of fisheries department Shamila Monteiro said the panchayat has issued an NOC but she would not know the details off hand.
 
 The fisheries department termed the upgradation as a mini fishing harbour or minor fishery harbour, but the villagers took objection to it. This was communicated to the department in a letter dated November 10, 2014.
