JAMMU: The Jammu and Kashmir government, which is gearing up to welcome migrants back to the Valley, has found that 66% of their temples and other religious structures were still intact and in good condition.   In reply to a question raised by BJP legislator Rajesh Gupta in the Assembly on Monday, the government said that only 185 of the 542 temples and religious structures of Kashmiri migrants (Pandits) in ten districts of the Valley were in a dilapidated condition.    The highest number of temples were located in Anantnag (129), followed by Pulwama (94), Srinagar (90) and Baramullah (58). Most of the temples which were in a dilapidated state were located in Anantnag (40), followed by Kupwara (28) and Baramullah (26).    Earlier this month, the J&K Assembly had passed a resolution to ensure the return of Kashmiri Pandits and other migrants to the Valley and create a conducive atmosphere for their resettlement.    Kashmiri Pandits, most of whom are living in Jammu, have welcomed the resolution. But they are sceptic about the follow-up plans of the government and the security situation in the Valley.    As part of the rehabilitation plans, the government has planned to build 6,000 transit accommodation on around 36 hectares in different districts of J&K.    However, the Hurriyat and some members in the Assembly had opposed the settlement of Kashmiri Pandits in exclusive colonies and urged the migrants to settle down in their native areas.    The relief package also includes the provision of 6,000 government jobs and an additional 9,000 jobs through the establishment of income-generating units for migrants. The home ministry has also approved an additional 3,000 jobs for migrants that will be directly funded by the central government.    The government said there was an abnormal rise in number of migrant families registered in Jammu ever since militancy broke out in the Valley in the early 1990s. They attribute this spurt to bifurcation of families and overall increase in population.    From 29,074 migrant families registered in 1997, the figure has soared to 41,462 families in 2017, which makes it an additional 12,388 families in a matter of two decades.    According to official data, there were 27,703 Kashmiri Pandit families in Jammu in 1997, which increased to 37,347 in 2017.    Similarly, the number of Muslim migrant families has increased to 2,252 in 2017 from 1,478 in 1997. However, the number of Sikh migrants has come down from 1,813 families in 1997 to 1,758 families this year.
