SHIMLA:  , who were allegedly subjected to discrimination during the telecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Pariksha Par Charcha” programme at Government high school, Chestha, in Kullu district, have now, through a video, accused the school’s upper caste midday meal cook of threatening them. Following their allegation, state education secretary Dr Arun Kumar   has sought a full report from the Kullu deputy commissioner.

 According to the video on the social media, Dalit students claim that after reports on their humiliation surfaced, Dila Ram who cooks the midday meal has threatened to make 4-5 Dalit students of class VIII and X disappear.
 
 Students in the video criticise Ram for his discriminatory attitude towards them. They claim that while he would allow an upper caste student to come near the cooking place, a Dalit student’s entry was restricted. 
 
 As per sources, it has become a daunting task for the school authorities to end discrimination in the school leading to tension. Cops are keeping a close vigil in the village with a case already registered against the school authorities.
 
 Shimla-based social activist Ravi Kumar Dalit said the state government should ensure strict implementation of provisions of the SC/ST Atrocities Act. He said all those involved in discrimination should be arrested immediately. “Threat issued to students is a serious matter and the government and authorities should act immediately,” he added
 
 Education secretary Sharma said he was aware of the video and had sought a detailed report from the   on this issue. Sharma elaborated that strict action would be ensured if anyone was found guilty of issuing threats to students.
 
 He said that schools had been given instructions to ensure that midday meal was served to students according to their roll numbers and a monthly report would be submitted by the DC to ensure no discrimination took place in midday meal serving.
