BENGALURU: Upset over a fight with her paralysed husband, who criticized her for preparing `tasteless sambar', a 50-year-old homemaker hanged herself on Friday night at her residence in Cholurpalya, west Bengaluru.

 Nagarathna Srinivas alias   is survived by her  , who runs an electronics shop on SP Road. “Srinivas, 55, is bedridden after he suffered a stroke many years ago. The couple would fight over trivial issues and Srinivas would get upset if Nagarathna shouted back at him,“ police said.
 
 According to family members, Srinivas slipped into depression after he was bedridden. “He worked as a   in Peenya industrial area for many years. He had to quit the job after the stroke,“ police said. “Mithun would leave home by 8am and return by 10pm. The couple spent the whole day at home, most of which they spent squabbling.This gradually pushed Nagarathna into depression.“
 
 On Friday night, Srinivas is said to have found fault with the sambar prepared by Nagarathna. “When he pulled her up, Nagarathna lost her cool and retorted by saying that was the best she could do. Srinivas accused her of neglecting him as he was unemployed and stayed home. Nagarathna tried to placate him by saying that wasn't what she meant. But Srinivas blamed himself and continued to rebuke her,“ police said. Mithun was on his way home when this transpired.
 
 Disturbed after the fight, Nagarathna locked herself in the room and took the extreme step. Police said they didn't come across a suicide note.
