CHENNAI: The controversial former director of   (KF) Leela   stirred a hornet’s nest on Friday lambasting the current management for commercialising the space inside the internationally-renowned institute of performing arts. It comes under the administrative control of the Union ministry of culture. Samson, a famous Bharatnatyam dancer, is also an alumnus of Kalakshetra.

 She objected to the use of the area around the sacred banyan tree which includes classrooms, for an event where vegetables, clothes and food including non-vegetarian fare were sold. She also shared photos and a video of the event held last week.
 
 “This has been going on for the past 2 years with the permission of the previous director ( ) and a senior staffer who is now principal and acting director. What is the ministry doing?” she wrote in the post. 
 
 The institute has been without a director for eight months since Priyadarshini Govind’s term ended.
 
 In a telephonic interview to TOI, Samson said it was another example of ‘the degradation of institutions across the country.’ “ All the staffers should resign as these incidents happened right under their noses,” she said, also questioning the governing  . On Friday evening, Samson deactivated her Facebook account, minutes after putting out a post indicating that she was reminded of a pending inquiry against her in the irregularities in KF during her directorship. She didn’t respond to calls after that. 
 
 Board member   said board members don’t reside in the foundation to know the exact events. “I have written to the chairman of the board. I was opposed to letting out the space for commercial activities per se but I’m not the only member on the board ,” she said.
 
 The KF board chairman, N Gopalaswami, told   had lied in the post. “What she has said is based on rumours. The space was given for conducting a festival on organic food, waste management and yoga . There was no non-vegetarian food on the campus,” he said.
