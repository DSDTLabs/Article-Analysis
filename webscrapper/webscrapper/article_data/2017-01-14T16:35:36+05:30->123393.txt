The fees of fitness certificates, renewal of registration, endorsing the lease, purchase agreements have been hiked more than a 100 times than the present fees.

 Autorickshaw driver Babu Gawade said, “The government has hiked fees unreasonably. Our livelihood depends on this daily business. As it is there is very little margin for profit in this business. The renewal of licence of now will cost Rs 200 against the present Rs 50. Now, the penalty for delay in getting the annual permit passing has risen from Rs 5 per day s to Rs 50 per day which is a big blow for us. The endorsing fee for lease, purchase agreement has risen from Rs100 to Rs 1,500 now. The government doesn’t want small operators like to work. The government is pushing the private players like cabs in the whole state.”
