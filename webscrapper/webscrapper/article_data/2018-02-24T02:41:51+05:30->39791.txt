NEW DELHI: Want to take a trip down the memory lane? Come Sunday, the   will provide parents an opportunity to introduce their kids to games that they used to play in their own childhood. The idea is to pull children away from gadgets and television.

 The initiative will bring children out in the open to experience the joy of simple games, such as stapoo, tyre race, pithoo, carom, rope-skipping, kancha, and so on. “This is a platform that fosters the bond between children, their parents and grandparents where everybody can discover the child in them,” said an onrgniser.
 
  
  
 
 The initiative is now in its third edition and will run through entire March and April. The previous two editions were organised in north Delhi areas, such as Mukherjee Nagar, Dwarka, and Rohini. This year, it has been extended to cover the rest of Delhi, Noida and Gurgaon. 
 
 During an earlier edition, when   caught up with an elderly person accompanying his grandson, he said: “The event reminds us of games that we used to play as children. These days, kids are glued to their mobile phones, laptops and television sets. Here, at least for half a day, they can play in the open and all they need is enthusiasm.”
 
 With her 10-year-old daughter immersed in the fun, her mother said: “For 2-3 hours, children are engaged in physical activity and they get to mingle with others. This is so rare these days.” 
 
 The organisers said they planned to scale up the event even further. “For the current edition, we will block a part of the road in the early hours (from 6am to 10am). DU college bands have been invited to perform and regale the audience. We will also have sport events like cycling and skating,” said an organiser.
