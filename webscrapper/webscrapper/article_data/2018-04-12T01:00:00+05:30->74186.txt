GAYA: JD (U) rebel and former speaker Udai Narain Chaudhary has predicted yet another political divorce between BJP and JD (U) in the state. The separation would come ahead of the Parliamentary election as a triangular contest would politically suit the BJP in the state. BJP stands to lose in a straight contest and its leadership knows it too well.

 Chaudhary said that BJP did extremely well in the last parliamentary election, mostly on account of the triangular contest following JD(U)’s exit from the NDA. The divorce will also mean imposition of President’s rule in the state and Parliamentary election under President’s rule will suit BJP, the most.
 
 As per his understanding of the Bihar politics, Nitish may team up with LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan in the next elections. “The next few months are very crucial for Bihar politics. Though Nitish parted company with Lalu in July'2017, a one to one meet between Nitish and PM Modi or even between Nitish Kumar and BJP chief Amit Shah, for that matter has not taken place,” said Chaudhary.
 
 “Finance minister Arun Jaitley and Union transport and highway minister Nitin Gadkari have been the men go between JD (U) and BJP leadership. Jaitley is now out of the scene now for health reasons and on his own Gadkari does not count much, in his own party,” added the former speaker.
 
 “Mandal (issue of reservation) has returned to the centre stage of Bihar politics,” said Chaudhary, who, a few months back floated Vanchit Vikas Morcha, an outfit to promote the interests of the deprived sections.
