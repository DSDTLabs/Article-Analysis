PATNA: Nothing can be better than enjoying cultural programmes and mouthwatering delicacies during spring season, especially in the evening and that, too, by spending just Rs10. Patnaites are no different and they throng in large numbers the third annual   which kick-started at Gandhi Maidan on Friday. 

 Celebrities and artists are scheduled to perform during the 12-day-long festival, which was inaugurated by deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi in the presence of art, culture and youth affairs department minister Krishna Kumar Rishi.
 
 Praising the response of the audience, Patna divisional commissioner Anand Kishor said the motive was to give an opportunity to the residents to enjoy and have good family time.
 
 “The excitement in the audience could be seen from the fact that they kept demanding the song of their choice during the performance of Bollywood singer Amit Kumar last night,” said Kishor.
 
 Organizers of the programme said cultural events have been scheduled after 6pm, while the fair can be visited between 11am and 10pm. At the fair, various swings and stalls selling handloom, accessories and food items have been put up. Sand art and drift wood art are other attractions at the fair.
 
 Giving the details of the programme, Kishor said Bollywood actor Rahul Roy will perform on February 18. Brij Rass dance will be organized on February 20 and Ashok Chakradhar, Suresh Awasthi, Yogendra Moudgil and Gauri Mishra will enthral the audience at the Hasya Kavi Sammelan on February 21.
