GURUGRAM: There has been a sharp increase in pollution levels in the city in the last two days, a surge experts have blamed on rampant   burning in villages on the outskirts.

 The concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 rose a staggering 70% on Friday and Saturday from the 100.78 micrograms per cubic metre recorded on Wednesday and Thursday, according to data provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
 
 The average concentration of PM2.5 was 186.54 micrograms per cubic metre and 193.65 micrograms per cubic metre on Saturday and Friday, respectively. The air quality Jindex (AQI), in turn, also saw a sharp   from 176 (considered ‘moderate’) to over 300 (considered ‘poor’) on Friday and Saturday.
 
 While experts have blamed the sudden spike on rabi crop   in Punjab and Haryana (that takes place during April and May), both the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) and the met department have refuted their claims.
 
 “Like every year, residue burning this year too has also led to a rise in the level of particulate matter. Authorities don’t have any concrete plan to curb crop burning,” said city-based environmentalist Vivek Kamboj.
 
 “The issue of crop burning was first highlighted in 2012 when   came up with satellite images. Crop burning always leads to sharp increase in the level of PM2.5 and PM 10. However, it is more during October Jand November due to dip in the temperature,” said former member of Environmental Pollution Control Authority, Niranjan Raje. 
 
 An HSPCB official said localised issues were to blame rather than crop burning. “Crop burning is 50% lesser this year as compared to last. There is hardly any crop burning around   at this point of time.”
