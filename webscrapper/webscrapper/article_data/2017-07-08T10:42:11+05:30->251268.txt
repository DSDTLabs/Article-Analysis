 A source close to the development told Mirror, "The meeting started at around 3 pm and went on for a couple of hours. It ended on a high note with Salman not only tweeting about it but also sharing a selfie with the top guys."
 
 When quizzed about what had transpired at this high-level meeting, the source offered, "The talks are still at a preliminary stage but Salman is definitely warming up to the digital platform." Were the negotiations regarding his library of films, past and upcoming, or on a new show? "It’s early days yet, could be a combination of the two," the source maintained.

It has a huge youth audience that is more receptive to experimental story-telling and, along with creative freedom, the platform offers makers the incentive of competitive budgets without the limitations of market demands. Salman’s good friend   recently struck a lucrative deal with a rival digital platform so the former’s move is not surprising.
