CHENNAI: City residents have often suffered silently when stuck in traffic due to political meetings or rallies, but an incident earlier this week gave a new dimension to such disruptions. 

 An 81-year-old resident of   1st lane passed away after a 45-minute futile wait for an ambulance that was less than a kilometre away but couldn't move in traffic due to a meeting at the   on the stretch.
 
 The senior citizen had complained of breathing difficulty and his family called the 108 service. An ambulance set off from Government Royapettah Hospital but got stuck and the patient died. The party meetings which have choked entry and exit for residents around the area are set to go on till January 9.
 
 "Even getting his death certificate and commuting to the Besant Nagar crematorium proved difficult as the whole road was blocked by SUVs belonging to party members, and it continues to be the case," said Jayalakshmi (name changed), daughter of the deceased.
 
 Another resident said she had started carrying address proof cards to show to police personnel on the roads around the venue. Traffic in the area is virtually at a standstill from 8am to 2pm, restricting access for hundreds of residents.
 
 Uma, member of a residents welfare association in the area, said they could not even take out their vehicles. "Each party member comes with 20-25 others, leading to total chaos," said Madhan, another resident.
 
 Senior traffic police officers told TOI that they would ensure school vans, emergency vehicles and residents would be allowed to enter and leave the area without hassle.
