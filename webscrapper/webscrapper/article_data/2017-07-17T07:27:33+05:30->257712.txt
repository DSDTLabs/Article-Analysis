LUCKNOW: The air was thick with the previous day's smoke. A pun gent smell hung in the Trauma Centre on Sunday , when only one   was conducted at the facility against the 20 that take place on a normal day .

 The number of patients with minor complaints who were administered tests or given primary treatment and sent back was 96 between Saturday night and Sunday evening. Generally, the number of such patience is 140-160 in a day. “We have resumed servic es and patients have started to come back form the units they were shifted to. Ten babies have been taken back in the neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU) and 12 in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) as also other units of the Trauma Centre. One patient underwent emergency abdominal surgery today,“ said Prof Haider Abbas, faculty in the Trauma Centre.
 
 Talking to reporters earlier in the day, Prof MLB Bhatt said, “We shifted around 178 patients with the help of 150 stretchers and trolleys on Saturday night.All students, doctors, staff and attendants had joined in in the rescue work. Patients had been shifted to the artificial limb centre unit, Lari Cardiology, both phase I and II of Shatabdi hospital, three wards of the surgery department and others. Some were shifted to other hospitals.“
