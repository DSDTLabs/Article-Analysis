VADODARA: The  , one of the most popular spots for those looking for food late in the night, resumed operations on Saturday. Market had been closed since Thursday after the   (VMC) cracked down on encroachments and unhealthy conditions there.

 The VMC had razed encroachments at the market on Thursday. The power and water connections of shops in the market were also snapped. The connections were restored only on Friday when those who had possession of the outlets there wanted to do a major clean up drive. The market has been constructed by the VMC that has leased out shops for eateries.
 
 Shopkeepers at the market said that after instructions by the civic body, they had conducted a major drive to spruce up the market. 
 
 “We will ensure that the market remains clean. We are even looking to rope in an agency to clean the market every day,” said a shopkeeper.
 
 VMC commissioner Dr Vinod Rao said that the shops had been allowed to start functioning on the condition that only those who had taken the shops on rent from VMC operated there. Operators who had been sublet shops by the original tenants will not be allowed to function.
 
 Ratribazaar is the only place in the city where eateries are officially allowed to function till 4am in the morning. The rush there has also increased after VMC’s Pravasi Gruh in the station area was razed. 
 
 Pravasi Gruh along with the neighbouring   had a series of eateries.
