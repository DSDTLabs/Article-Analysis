BATHINDA: Farmers of three villages of Bathinda district blocked the Bathinda-Bajakhana road on Saturday in protest against the non-registration of their land in their names despite having its possession for the past many decades. Farmers of Jeeda, Khemuana and Jandwala villages held a protest and were supported by peasant outfit BKU (Ekta Sidhupur).

 The contentious land measures 556 acres at Jeeda, 325 acres at Khemuana and 1,450 acres at Jandwala. The protesting farmers alleged that the file about the land mutations was pending before the Punjab financial commissioner, revenue ( ), for over a year due to which 1,000 families in three villages were affected. Some portion of that land in the three villages is shamlat (common village land), which is under the possession of certain farmers. 
 
 Of the 556 acres in Jeeda without mutation, nearly 20 acres are situated on the   highway. The Bathinda-Bajakhana stretch on that highway is to be four-laned by the NHAI. The latter has acquired land for widening the road and compensation to owners of these 20 acres has not been given as their names are not in the revenue records. The NHAI has given nearly Rs 64 lakh per acre to land owners in adjoining villages.
 
  village said that, “The 556 acres of our village has not been entered in our names in the revenue records despite these being in our possession since 1950. The case is pending with the FCR and now 20 acres have been acquired by the NHAI and compensation for that is stuck due to that.”
 
 Meanwhile,   said that, “I have called the farmers and we are looking into the matter.”
