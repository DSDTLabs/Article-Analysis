The CID (crime) stated before the court that former BJP MLA Nalin Kotadiya along with other accused, including Kirit Paladiya, Ketan Patel and Jatin Patel — had hatched the conspiracy to extort money at the Surat circuit house. “The accused hatched conspiracy to kidnap Shailesh Bhatt for ransom. One of the accused, Ketan Patel, then talked to Jagdish Patel, the then SP, Amreli, and made the plan with the help of other cops. As part of the plan, Shailesh Bhatt was later kidnapped from Gandhinagar,” said the plea submitted before the session court on Tuesday.
