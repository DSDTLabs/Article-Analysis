Porvorim: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) MLA Churchill Alemao alleged that the current casino payout ratio in Goa is 90:10 percent which leads to bankruptcy for many Goan people and demanded that the payout ratio should be at least 50:50. Taking part in the discussion on motion of thanks to governor’s address, the lone NCP legislator said that he understands the casino business better than any other member of the house as he has visited casinos because of his profession as a seafarer in the past. He also said that there was no mention of casinos in the governor’s speech. Citing an example of how Singapore has increased the fee for entry to local people, Alemao said that there should be a fee of at least Rs 5,000 for locals to discourage them from going to casinos. Without naming three businessman from Panaji, Alemao said that they have become bankrupt due to casinos. He also said that there are casinos where they don’t even charge entry fees and people with Rs 500 in their pocket visit these places, consume alcohol, get back home and fight with their family members. “We have to stop locals from going to casinos,” he said. Alemao also asked the chief minister Manohar Parrikar to look at the payout ratio and how the roulette tables are ‘fixed’ in casinos. Speaking on the airport issue, Alemao said that the government should get a letter from the Union civil aviation ministry that both airports will function after Mopa airport is made operational. He also opposed the state government’s decision to install speed governors for taxis and the removal of carriers from taxis.
