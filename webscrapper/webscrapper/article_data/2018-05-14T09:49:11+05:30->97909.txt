CHANDIGARH: The Rohtak MP and   leader   said on Sunday that the Congress has emerged as the only alternative in the state as well as the Centre, when it comes to development and overall growth.

 Hooda junior was chairing the meeting of workers of   assembly. He was reviewing the Jan Kranthi Yatra, which is scheduled to start from June 3. Addressing the party workers at the New Grain Market, Hooda dared the   government to come out with the details of job opportunities provided to the youth as promised in the manifesto.
 
 “The people of the state are completely dejected by the performance of the BJP government in the state. Before the elections, they said BJP would bring development through the double engine as both, the state and the Center would have a BJP-led government. However, both the engines have failed, and the people of the state have been left stranded in the middle of the road,” he said.
 
 He said the BJP had and was constantly trying to break the decade-old brotherhood to meet its political goals and despite being the main opposition party, INLD was aiding the BJP’s nefarious intentions while continuing its support to the BJP at the Centre.
 
 With the Yatra scheduled to restart in June, Hooda has held more than 24 meetings in different parts of the state to galvanize workers for the Yatra. “The people of the state cannot wait for the next elections to vote out BJP and teach INLD a lesson,” he said.
 
 
 
 While   held a rally at Naraingarh, his father Bhupinder Hooda had an interaction with the beleaguered sanitation and contractual staff of the civic body, who are protesting for the past three days. He reiterated to ensure that their demands on regular employment are accepted and other issues are solved after Congress comes to power in Haryana. Till then, he urged the protesters to refrain from violent agitation or spilling garbage on roads.
