Surat: The balcony of a flat on the first floor of 15-year-old Rajlaxmi Palace apartment collapsed in Umra zone of Surat on Thursday. 

 The collapsed structure was a 10x10 balcony built in a triangular shape. This was the third incident of collapse in Umra zone in the past 48 hours. There were no casualties, the police said. Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) officials said the incident was mainly due to seepage of water. 
 
 Fire brigade officials said the balcony of Rajlaxmi Palace located near Agrasen Bhavan collapsed suddenly. Fire brigade officer Rasik Patel said, “The process of seeping from a bathroom located close by had made the balcony weak.” The flat on the first floor of Rajlaxmi Palace is owned by Navin Dediya. 
 
 B N Gadiya , executive engineer at SMC, said, “The primary cause of collapse seems to be seepage. We would remove the whole part of the collapsed structure and take necessary action for the safety of people.”
