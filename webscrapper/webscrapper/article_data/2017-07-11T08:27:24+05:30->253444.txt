CHENNAI: The 72mm   in the city on Sunday not only  , it also made its impact felt on the concourse of one of India’s largest railway stations,  . Portions of the roof began to leak and soon enough there were “Coutrallam like water-fall” on the station premises around 8:30pm on Sunday night, highlighting the poor state of affairs at the station.

 Social media was flooded with videos of the streams of water which soon formed puddles inside the station, much to the chagrin of the passengers. Water was also leaking in different parts of the station and dripping on to luggage and parcels.
 
 A senior official in Chennai division of Southern Railway said, “A portion of the roof-gutter had broken because of which the leakage had occurred. A similar scenario was experienced during an earlier heavy spell of rain and it was worse during the December 2015 floods when the station was filled with water.
 
 “Chennai Central has been billed as a world-class station and private agencies are going to bid for redeveloping the land around the station, but the leaking roof shows how railways first has to invest in improving existing facilities,” said a passenger who was stuck at the station on Sunday.
