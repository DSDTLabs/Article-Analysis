COLVA: Following the death of a jet ski helper while manoeuvring the water craft at Varca, last week, the tourism department on Thursday issued a showcause notice to   operator based on the complaint filed against him by the   police station  . 

 Director of tourism Menino D’Souza told TOI that the operator has been asked to explain why action should not be taken against him.
 
 Colva police sub-inspector Rahul Naik had registered a case under Section 304A (causing death by negligence not amounting to culpable homicide) against the operator,  .
 
 On May 12, Anil Pawar, 22, a native of Bijapur, engaged as a helper by the operator, fell into the sea after being hit by a strong wave and drowned. His body washed ashore at Colva.
 
 Naik in his complaint said that as per the account of the incident given by informants, sources, and tourist police unit staff, on the fateful day the sea was very rough and the wind conditions too, were not favourable for water sports activities. Naik, who is investigating the case, said he is yet to record statements of Drishti lifeguards and the tourist police.
 
 The owner allowed the employee to navigate the jet ski without any safety harness, which resulted in the death of the employee, Naik said in his complaint, adding that this amounted to an act of negligence on the part of the operator.
 
 The complaint also states Pawar was hired despite not having any licence from a competent authority.
 
 Refuting all charges, Fernandes questioned the tourist police and Drishti lifeguards instead. 
 
 “Why did the police not stop me from carrying out my business if the weather was rough and why did they not ask the deceased to produce his licence and why did they allow him to navigate the jet ski, and that too, without a life jacket?” Fernandes asked. He also demanded to know how tourists were allowed to bathe or swim in the sea on the day when the sea was rough and the weather windy.
