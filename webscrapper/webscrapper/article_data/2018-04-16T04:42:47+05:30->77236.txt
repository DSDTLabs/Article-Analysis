MEERUT: Uttar Pradesh DGP   has categorically denied claims of encounter “fixing” after an audio clip suggesting some   leaders can “manage encounters” leaked and went viral on WhatsApp. 

 
 In the clip, the voice suspected to be that of Suneet Kumar Singh, station house officer of Mauranipur in Jhansi, is heard alerting Lekhraj Singh Yadav, a criminal wanted in several murder and extortion cases, about a planned encounter.
 
 In the lengthy conversation between former block pramukh Lekhraj Singh, who has over 70 cases, including murder and dacoity, against him and SHO Suneet Kumar Singh, the latter is heard boasting to have killed many criminals. The SHO asks Lekhraj to be prepared for getting killed in an encounter any time.
 
 He is then heard advising Lekhraj to “manage” some local BJP leaders. “I will advise you to manage Sanjay Dubey (BJP district president) and Rajeev Singh Parichha (Babina MLA) then only you can get some relief. Or else, anything can happen.”
 
 During a visit to Bulandshahr for crime review meeting on Sunday, DGP Singh said, “This (claims of encounter being managed) is absolutely wrong. The police officer concerned has been suspended and an inquiry has been initiated in the case.” 
 
 Meanwhile, the department is trying its best to distance itself from the controversy by terminating the erring inspector from the job. “The DGP has made up his mind to terminate him from the service. He has a criminal past and was earlier terminated in 2007 but was reinstated after he got relief from the HC,” a source in the department said. 
 
 Even after criticism from certain sections, including human rights groups,   have continued in the state with 47 criminals gunned down in close to 1,500 encounters in the past one year. 
 
 The crackdown that started on March 20, 2017 has led to 2,956 arrests till February 14. Cops have also seized 169 properties worth Rs 147 crore of criminals on the run.
