PUNE: Sweden's   and London Games bronze medallist   scored better than the existing World Record to win gold and silver respectively in the rifle 50m prone final of   of Hannover on Saturday.

 Narang scored 250 to finish only 0.1 point behind Olsson’s 250.1 in the eight-man final.
 
 The Indian was poised to win gold till the 22nd shot with 229.9 points, while the Swede was at 229.8 points. But a 9.9 in the 23rd shot proved costly for Narang as Olsson fired a 10.3. Narang recovered with a 10.2 in the last (24th) shot, but a 10 was enough for Olsson to seal the yellow metal.
 
 Since the Hannover event is not an ISSF event, the record scores will not be considered official. Nonetheless, the score is good enough to be a new Indian national record. 
 
 
  
 The bronze went to France’s Remi Moreno with 228.3 points.
 
 Japan's Toshikazu Yamashita had created the finals record according to the new rules, which came into effect from January 1 this year. Yamashita had scored 249.8 at the New Delhi World Cup in February.
 
 With 624.8 points, Narang was fifth to qualify for the final. Another Indian, Swapnil Kusale (Maharashtra) scored 626.1 to qualify fourth. But in the final, finished fifth with 145 points.
 
 Narang dedicated the silver medal to sports psychologist and mentor, late Bhishmaraj Bam.
 
 Bam had passed away after suffering a cardiac arrest in Nashik on Friday. Bam was mentor to many national and international shooters and sportspersons, including Narang.
 
 "I dedicate this medal to Bam sir. He had mentored so many young and senior shooters and made difference to their lives. I am saddened by the news of his demise. I feel he has played a huge role in my career," Narang told TOI from Hannover.
