RANCHI:   (BJP) stalwart   on Wednesday said the state should have gathered   on security ahead of  's   on January 1, where, slippers were hurled at him. Former CM Munda called the incident 'unfortunate'. 

 "The incident is unfortunate. There are other ways to protest and express discontent. But having said that, the government should have collected intelligence inputs before the CM's scheduled visit," Munda, the former Seraikela legislator, said. 
 
 Das visited Arjuna stadium in Seraikela on January 1 to pay homage to those who died in a police firing during a tribal uprising movement in 1948. Hundreds of tribal agitators had gheraoed Das to vent their ire against the amendments to CNT and SPT Acts and hurled slippers at his convoy. 
 
 Munda was also present at the event but he left an hour before the CM's arrival, sparking speculations about increasing hostilities between the two leaders. "I visit the ceremony every year, pay homage and stay there for 15 minutes. This year was no exception," Munda said. However, sources in BJP said hostilities between the two have increased after Das government passed the amendments to CNT and SPT Acts . 
 
 "There is a complete breakdown in communication between the two after winter session. Mundaji wrote to the CM and expressed his concerns on the amendments instead of calling him," a BJP insider said. The two leaders are expected to come face to face in working committee meeting of the party which is scheduled to be held in Seraikela on January 10.
