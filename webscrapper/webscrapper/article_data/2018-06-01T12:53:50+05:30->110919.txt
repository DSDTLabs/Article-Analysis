YAVATMAL:   divisional commissioner   has on Wednesday suspended Babhulgaon tehsildar   on charges of shielding sand mafias operating in his jurisdiction.

 
 The commissioner has directed the suspended tehsildar to remain at headquarters, which is the district collectorâ€™s office. He has been instructed not to leave headquarters without prior permission of the collector.
 
 Villagers of Watkhed I and II had lodged a number of complaints to the collector alleging that there were thefts of sand from the river beds by sand mafias. Collector Dr   had, after returning from his in-service training, ordered Pusad Sub-Divisional Officer Nitinkumar Hingole to launch surprise raids on sand dunes in the village.
 
 SDO Nitinkumar Hingole and his team conducted the surprise raids on the midnight of May 17, and seized 42 vehicles and a large quantity of sand loaded in the vehicles from the site. On a complaint lodged by tehsildar Dilip Zade, Babhulgaon police had registered criminal offences against the mafias.
 
 SDO Nitinkumar had sent a report to the district collector regarding the dubious role of the tehsildar in the theft of sand worth crores.
 
 Collector Rajesh Deshmukh had then sent a proposal to the divisional commissioner of Amravati to suspend the tainted tehsildar, followed by a departmental inquiry against him. Accordingly, commissioner Piyush Singh ordered the tehsildar to be suspended with immediate effect.
