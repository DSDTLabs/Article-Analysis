 has always pulled off dark characters with elan. Be it as gangster Chandu in his debut outing 'Company', Maya bhai in 'Shootout At  ', gangster-turned-politician   in 'Rakht Charitra', or the evil   in the superhero franchise '  3', the versatile actor has made bad look good. 

 Now, he is all set to return to the grey zone with two distinct characters. Upcoming Tamil film 'Vivegam' will see him locking horns with South superstar Ajith. He will also make his debut on the digital platform with Excel Entertainmentâ€™s soon-to-be-released web series 'Power Play', in which he plays a pivotal role. 
 
 While he enjoys doing comedies,Vivek finds negative characters more challenging, because they are drastically different from the kind of person he is in real life.
