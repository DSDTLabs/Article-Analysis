It’s a fact that the world is early looking forward to watching ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ later this month. Talking about what’s exactly it is going to offer, reportedly,   is the only star in ‘Avengers: Infinity War’, and to certain extent Robert Downey Jr to have read the whole script of the movie. While others had only cues to their respective parts. 

 
 Recently at a show, the ‘Doctor Strange’ aka Cumberbatch said in a statement, "I had to just, sorta, understand what the context was. Strange has this wonderful role in it and I’m trying to, kinda, hold the multiverse together.”
 
 
 Added, "So kinda needed to know what goes on in-between those brackets."
 
 
 Well, being on an encompassing promotional tour, all the eyes and “ears” of Avenger fans were to him. 
 
 
 According to a daily, Cumberbatch even teased the plot of the film earlier on a popular celebrity show. He reportedly averred that he was allowed to read the whole script so he does know what is happening, but he can't tell everyone about it. However, he quipped, “What I can say is that I am helping the world and worlds beyond it – potentially."
 
 
 Now as per another report, this statement of Cumberbatch is giving wings to a fan theory that speculates about the   opting for time travel to save the universe. This is because, Cumberbatch's character, ‘Doctor Strange’ guards the ‘Time Stone’ in the ‘Eye of Agamoto’. 
 
 
 Therefore, the question is whether ‘Doctor Strange’ will turn the time and create events that will change the course of Marvel Cinematic Universe beyond everyone’s current knowledge?
 
 
 Everything will be answered soon as the much-awaited film is slated to release on April 27.
