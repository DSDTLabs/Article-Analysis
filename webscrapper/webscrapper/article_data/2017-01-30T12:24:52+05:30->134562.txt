PANAJI: It may have failed to stitch together a   for the February 4 elections, but Congress remains open to the idea of a post-poll alliance with like-minded political parties to form the next government in Goa. Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) plans to ramp up its campaign decibel level in the coming days as it attempts to dislodge the incumbent  .

 “We are fighting to win a majority. We cannot compromise on basic principles of our election manifesto. If any other party or an independent candidate wants to support the Congress , and our election manifesto, they are free to join,” all India Congress Committee general secretary   said speaking to TOI.
 
 He said that any post poll alliance would depend on the other political party or independent MLA coming on the same page on issues such as continuation of grants to English medium primary schools and removal of casinos.
 
 “Even if we don’t get a majority, we will never compromise on basic principles, particularly on the issue of MOI, RP2021, casinos and also on governance and schemes for youth and women,” Singh said.
 
 He said that the Congress party was looking to capitalize on the disappointment over BJP’s performance. “I have never seen an incumbent chief minister being dumped the way current chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar has been dumped by the BJP. My own assessment is that he may lose the election and Sopte will defeat him,” Singh said.
 
 Singh, however, hinted that the recent discontent within the Congress could hamper the party’s prospects in the upcoming elections. GPCC general secretary Sunil Kawthankar and spokesperson Trajano D’Mello recently criticized the party’s senior leadership.
 
 “We don’t want such people (D’Mello and Kawthankar). In Goa, this commitment to a cause or an ideology is something very fragile. There is no ideological commitment, this is a sad thing for Goan politics,” Singh said.
