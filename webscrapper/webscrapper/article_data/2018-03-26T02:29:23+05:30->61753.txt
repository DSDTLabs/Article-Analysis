MUMBAI: The Thane   has launched a manhunt to trace builder  , an alleged  , after the Kalyan session courts on Friday rejected his anticipatory bail application in connection with a 2010 Andheri  . 

 Police claimed Bhatti and his four associate builders —Afghan Khan, Kamal Jadwani, Zeenat Ahmed and Usman Khan—took over a Mhada redevelopment project in   (W) and forced the partner developer, Surjit Roy of Roy and Associates, at gunpoint to sign the cancellation deed in the Bandra registration office. The accused then handed over the project to a third party.
 
 In 2010, Roy undertook the redevelopment of Andheri Stadium View Society from Mhada and made ARK Developers, owned by Bhatti, Afghan and Jadwani, partner. “ARK was to redevelop the society, hand over 4,500 sq ft and Rs 70 lakh to Roy, and give monthly rentals to the society members till the project was completed,” said inspector Rajkumar Kothmire of the Thane anti-extortion cell. “However, in August 2012, Bhatti, Afghan, Jadwani and Usman, along with their henchmen, barged into Roy’s Ambernath office, and threatened Roy at gunpoint to cancel the agreement. When Roy protested, they threatened him and called Chhota Shakeel, who told Roy to follow Bhatti’s instructions.” 
 
 Inspector Pradeep Sharma said, “The accused gave Roy Rs 30 lakh, bundled him in their car and drove to the Bandra registration office where they forced him to sign the cancellation deed. They left after threatening to harm him and his family if he would file a police complaint. After we arrested Dawood’s brother Iqbal Kaskar in September 2017, Roy mustered courage and lodged a complaint in February 2018.” 
 
 TOI made calls to Afghan, Bhatti and Usman, but their phones were switched off.
