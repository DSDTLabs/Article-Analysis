 is going back into the world of Stephen King.

  According to media, studio giant Warner Bros. has tapped Flanagan to direct the highly-anticipated sequel of 1980 hit-movie   titled  .
 
  'Doctor Sleep', the author's 2013 sequel to 'The Shining', picks up with little   all grown up, but still grappling with demons both real and metaphorical. He is haunted by his father, but not in the way you might expect.
 
  Middle-aged Dan Torrance is battling the same alcoholic tendencies that made his old man so susceptible to the malevolent forces of the Overlook Hotel.
 
  This is the second time Flanagan will be helming a King adaptation.
 
  His previous credentials include 'Oculus' (2013), 'Before I Wake' (2016) and   (2016).
 
  'The Shining', published in 1977, was adapted by Stanley Kubrick into the classic 1980 film starring   as Jack Torrance, an aspiring writer who agrees to become the caretaker of the Overlook Hotel during its offseason, bringing his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) and son Danny (Danny Lloyd) with him.
