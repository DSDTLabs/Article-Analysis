MADURAI: The Madras high court Madurai bench on Thursday disposed of a plea seeking direction to the   police to register a case against the vice-chancellor of Gandhigram Rural Institute -  ,   for threatening a staff member.

 Justice P   gave this direction on a plea filed by a staff of the university, M A Raju. When the case came up for hearing, the petitioner’s counsel told the court that the VC threatened Raju and used abusive language against him.
 
 The petitioner had approached the offices of the Prime Minister and human resources and development (HRD) minister regarding his long-pending promotional matter.
 
 Meanwhile, the petitioner on November 16 last year went to the VC’s chamber with regard to administrative affairs. The VC who received letters from the Prime Minister office and HRD office told the petitioner that he (VC) is the authority to sort out everything, and not the Prime Minister or HRD minister.
 
 The VC further said that he would show his real face and the petitioner has to face consequences.
 
 Regarding that, the petitioner lodged a complaint before the Ambathurai police in Dindigul district on November 17. But, the police did not take action on it. The petitioner lost hope in police. Hence, it was necessary to issue a direction to the police to register a case based on the complaint.
 
 The court disposed of the case after issuing a direction to the police .
