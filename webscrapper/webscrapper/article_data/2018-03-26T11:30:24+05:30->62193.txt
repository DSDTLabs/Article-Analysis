MADURAI: A head constable with   police department swam across the Palk Strait from Talaimannar in Sri Lanka to Dhanushkodi in Rameswaram Island, India in eight hours duration. Mothukuri Tulasi Chaitanya, a swimming champion, had won many awards including seven medals at the   and Fire Games at Los Angeles, United States in 2017. He started swimming from Talaimannar at 1 am on Saturday morning and reached Dhanushkodi around 9.25 am, taking 8 hours and 25 minutes to cross around 18 nautical miles, a record among many swimmers who had crossed the Strait in the past.

 As he reached the shore on Sunday morning, he was received by his family members, fisheries officials and fishermen leaders at Dhanushkodi shore, garlanding him for the achievement. Talking to reporters, Chaitanya said that he had taken to swimming at the age of nine. He had won many medals at state, national and international swimming competitions. He also thanked his trainer Ganesh. 
 
 Chaitanya had intended to cross this distance between Talaimannar and Dhanushkodi in less than the actual hours he took, but the sea currents were strong and there was interference from jelly fishes in the water, he said. After obtaining the required documentation, Chitanya was practicing at Rameswaram last week. 
 
 Police sources said that both Indian and Sri Lankan marine agencies were escorting the swimmer with necessary life-support equipment. Many have swum the Strait in the past including child swimmer from Chennai, Kutraleeswaran, who was into limelight for his swimming stints, taking 16 hours when he was 12 in 1994.
 
 On Saturday, another Chennai based college student   attempted the swimming stint, taking around 12 hours to cross Palk Strait.
