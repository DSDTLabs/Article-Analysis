Parents, take note! Playing with   and certain   can help children develop spatial skills critical to success in science and engineering, say scientists.

 “By providing spatial training to children, and providing spatially demanding toys before schooling starts, we can give them the opportunity to develop skills important in fields like science, technology, engineering and math,” said  , from Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in the US.
 
 The study, published in the journal ‘Geosphere’, surveyed hundreds of undergraduate students and found a huge spread in their spatial skills.
 
 They found that childhood play patterns made a huge difference. Spatial skill scores were significantly higher among students who engaged with construction-based toys, and certain video games.
