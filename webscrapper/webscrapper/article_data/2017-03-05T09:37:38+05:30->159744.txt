BENGALURU: As   began the opening day's proceedings, driving   to the boundary twice in an over, the home crowd, in excess of 25,000, erupted in joy. But Rahul - playing his first Test match at his home ground - did not play too many gorgeous shots. He batted with focus and intent.

 India's highest run-getter in the three innings so far in the series, Rahul's shoulder could be a cause of concern. In the 71st over bowled by Stephen O' Keefe, the bowled by Stephen O' Keefe, the batsman looked in pain and discomfort twice -once while gunning for a big sweep and another while attempting a drive.
 
 Admitting his shoulder was bothersome, the 24-year-old opener said: "I had to get as many runs as I could with the last two batsmen there. The lofted shots gave me a bit of a problem in Pune. So I had to restrict that shot. But in the last few overs I had to take that chance and risk which I knew would give me some pain. Medical treatment at that time wouldn't have done a lot of good for me. So I looked to continue and tried to play a few shots which didn't go my way."
 
 Asked for his assessment of the pitch and Lyon's eight-wicket haul, he said the rough created by Starc aided Lyon's show. "The wicket was pretty dry and the cracks were prominent there. Their bowlers, especially when Starc bowls from over the wicket, created the rough for Lyon which helped them get the spin and bounce. Once the ball got older and there was more rough outside the off stump, Lyon exploited it. He kept bowling there consistently and got some purchase out of the wicket."
 
 Rahul was confident, with four more days left, the game is still on. "It's just the first day, there are four more days to go. The cracks are opening up and it's getting harder to bat on this wicket."
