THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Governor   has urged   ( ) to become a model to other institutions in the effective use of technology, ‘not just by expanding online examinations to all centres, but through a re-engineering of the manual processes’.

 “We often find that public organizations do not show full faith in the adoption of technologies, and modernization becomes a mere replication of the manual processes on computers,” he said while inaugurating the closing ceremony of PSC’s diamond jubilee celebrations here on Monday.
 
 The governor said PSC should do a lot of homework to avoid such flaws. Citing statistics which showed huge increase in the number of job seekers approaching the PSC, Sathasivam said the situation called for speeding up the selection process by safeguarding accuracy and social justice. “Kerala being a digitally empowered state, the PSC has not faced much resistance against the conduct of online examinations. We have four online examination centres, which is not enough. We should also examine whether our plan to convert 40% of the conventional examinations into online mode would be enough to serve our purpose,” he said.
 
 He lauded the commission for earning ‘the unfailing trust’ of people in the past six decades, “While the business of other PSCs in the country is limited to selection to certain elite posts, our PSC is saddled with the task of recruitment to all state government departments, PSUs, local self-governments, cooperative sector, all universities and now to the recently constituted   Administrative Service,” Sathasivam added.
 
 Finance minister T M Thomas Isaac, who presided over the function, said the public demand for PSC recruitment in universities and aided schools is a solid proof to the people’s trust the commission earned over the past six decades.
