PANAJI: Chief minister Manohar   on Tuesday said, “If one is poor doesn’t mean he or she should be dirty. A poor person also should stay  . It doesn’t cost. In fact, it costs less to stay clean.” 

 The chief minister, while being critical of the ‘dirty and untidy’ conditions created by vendors outside the Goa   College and Hospital, said maintaining cleanliness does not cost money. 
 
 “See the dirt. Those who sell outside (GMC), see their dirtiness. There are sacks lying around, plastic hanging. No matter how good a space you are provided you want to hang one plastic there.... People are spitting and throwing garbage next to the  . Just look at the mess the vendors have created outside the hospital,” Parrikar said. 
 
 He said the people need to use the facilities as if it were their own and added, “Let us be clean, neat.”
 
 The government will take steps to clear the mess outside the state’s premier government hospital and designate an area outside the hospital to which the vendors’ activities will be restricted, he said.
 
 “All this will be sorted soon, I guarantee you. I have no objection to anyone earning a livelihood for themselves. But you cannot just sit anywhere and start selling your stuff. If you want, I will designate a place for it,” Parrikar said.
 
 He sought the cooperation of St Cruz MLA Antonio Fernandes and St Andre MLA Francisco Silveira in resolving the issue as the institution partly falls in both these constituencies.
