NEW DELHI: The   on Friday said it will soon list the six-year old appeals challenging the Allahabad high court verdict equally dividing the Babri Masjid-Ramjanmabhoomi disputed area among the contending parties. The court’s assurance came in response to BJP leader Subramanian Swamy’s plea that his fundamental right to worship in the Ram Temple at   is being violated because of the SC’s delay.

 A bench headed by Chief Justice   said: “It will be heard soon. We are taking a decision on this”. On March 22, the CJI had surprised opposing parties by appealing for a negotiated settlement and even offering his services as a mediator.
 
 The HC on September 30, 2010 had delivered a judgement dividing the 2.7 acre disputed land into three equal parts between Sunni  , Nirmohi Akhara and ‘Ram Lalla’, the idol.
 
 The SC had stayed the HC verdict on May 9, 2011 with the judges on the bench — Aftab Alam and R M Lodha — terming the decision strange as no party to the suits had claimed relief on the lines decided by the HC.
