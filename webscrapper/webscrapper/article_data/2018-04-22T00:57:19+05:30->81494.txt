NEW DELHI: The Barapullah elevated road’s extension to INA Market and   in   is likely to open in June after missing its third deadline last month. PWD officials said construction of the road is complete barring a short 126-metre stretch near the Sewa Nagar railway crossing that   will build.

 
 The 2-km extension is the second phase of the project. The 4-km Phase I connecting   with JLN Stadium has been operational since the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Phase II had a 2015 deadline, which was extended to September 2017, then March 2018.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Phase II has faced many hurdles, including delayed permission to build on railway land. PWD officials say the railways kept them waiting for one-and-a-half years. Work was also stopped last year when the high court ordered PWD to finish desilting Kushak Nullah to ensure waterlogging didn’t occur during rains. The civic agency built piers for the road in the nullah while railways installed the girders above the track.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 We have completed our portion and now Northern Railway needs to complete its work near the Sewa Nagar railway crossing. It is likely to be completed by June,” said a senior PWD official. A senior Northern Railway official told TOI they have to complete a 126-metre segment. “Some coordination issues initially resulted in delay, but now work has resumed. The girders have been placed over the railway line. We are laying concrete slabs and surfacing the road. Our deadline is June 15.”
 
 Barapullah Phase II will bring down travel time for airport-bound traffic from east Delhi. Phase III, which is likely to be finished by December at a cost of Rs 1,260 crore, will extend the elevated road across the Yamuna to Mayur Vihar in east Delhi. It will shorten the commute from Mayur Vihar to Aurobindo Marg to 15-20 minutes, from more than an hour at present. However, work on Phase III is held up due to delays in acquiring riverbed land.
