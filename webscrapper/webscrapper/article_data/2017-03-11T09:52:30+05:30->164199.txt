HYDERABAD: For some cops in the city, a ban on protests at  , which was synonymous with dissent may have come as a sigh of relief, but their short-staffed counterparts in the city outskirts are fuming.

 The government has suggested four other alternatives for protesters, in  , Shamshabad, Gandimaisamma and  . The move was taken after protests spilled over near the state assembly.
 
 Now, officials of police stations manning the new sites claim that they are severely understaffed, in case one of the protests turns violent.
 
 According to DCP (central zone) D Joel Davis--under whose jurisdiction the erstwhile site of dissent fell--said: “We usually have personnel from one station on vigil near the chowk. But whenever the protests took a violent turn, we were forced to deploy forces from the entire zone.There have been times when we have had to rope in the reserve police as well.“
 
 Going by the trend, cops from the new dharna zones say that they are not well prepared for such a situation, and would have to depend heavily on reserve forces to control any situation.
 
 “There are times when protests go out of hand, but then we would pull in staff from all stations in the zone.But that would mean that other stations would have to put their guard down,“ Shamshabad inspector, PS K  , said.
 
 He further added that there is no space in his police station limits, for people to congregate and voice their displeasure. On the other hand, offici als from the Jawaharnagar police station, said they would have no choice but to man the area.
