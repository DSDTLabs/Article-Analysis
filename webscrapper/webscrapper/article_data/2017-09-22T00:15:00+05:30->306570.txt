Erode: Vehicular traffic on Dimbam ghat road near Bannari, which connects Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, was halted for more than three hours on Thursday after a crushed stone aggregate laden truck developed a snag and stranded in the middle of the road.

 “When the truck was heading to Hasanur from Sathyamangalam with stone aggregate weighing about six tonne, it halted at the 8th hairpin bend of the ghat section,” said a highway patrol police.
 
 The driver could not move the truck due to some problem in the axle, said the police. “It was hard for him to find a mechanic to fix the snag at the earliest,” the police added. 
 
 When the driver was struggling, vehicles started queuing up on both sides of the road. 
 
 Trucks and government buses from both the states were stopped at Hasanur and Bannari checkposts to prevent long queues on the ghat road. 
 
 Later, a mechanic was brought to the spot from Sathyamangalam and he struggled with the snag for two hours before the truck was able to drive to Hasanur and flow of vehicles resumed on the road.
