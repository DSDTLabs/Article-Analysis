PATNA: Former CM   visited Banke Bihari temple in the city on Monday along with her newlywed son   and daughter-in-law   Rai to seek blessing from Lord Vishnu.

 Sources said Rabri performed rituals at the temple, while Aishwarya offered a chunri (holy cloth) to Lord Vishnu. Rabri termed Aishwarya an avatar of Goddess Lakshmi. “Meri bahu Lakshmi jaisi hai. Ghar me bahu ke pair padne se pahle hi khushiyon ne kadam rakhna shuru kar diya (My daughter-in-law is like Lakshmi. Good things started happening in my family before she stepped into my house),” Rabri told media persons after coming out of the temple.
 
 The Lalu family, in fact, got good news one after another over the past few days. While a Ranchi court quashed a contempt case against   on Thursday, RJD chief Lalu Prasad was granted a three-day parole by Ranchi’s Birsa Munda central jail administration on Thursday to attend the wedding of his elder son. He was also granted a six-week provisional bail by the Jharkhand high court on Friday on medical grounds. Rabri, on the other hand, was appointed leader of opposition in   legislative council on Saturday.
 
 Rabri thanked the Gods for Tej’s marriage as well as happiness coming back to her family. “God does everything for the good. We start any auspicious work by taking the names of Gods and Goddesses and thank them upon completion of the work,” she said.
