NEW DELHI: Successive governments in Delhi have raked up old   allotment   to fix liability on private schools to follow specific criteria in their functioning.

 This tendency came under spotlight of high court on Tuesday when it stayed the government’s latest notification on nursery admission.
 
 “This court is prima facie of the view that the power to define the concept/criteria of neighbourhood or locality lay with Delhi Development Authority or land owning agencies on the date it allotted the land. Prima facie, the said concepts cannot be defined unilaterally three to four   later,” Justice Manmohan noted.
 
 Since the schools had sought to discredit the land allotment clause itself while challenging the DoE notification,   made it clear that as schools continue to occupy and operate on allotted lands, they cannot seek stay of terms and conditions stipulated either in lease deed or allotment letter and that too, a few decades later.
 
 At the same time however,   stressed that the term/condition in the allotment letter or lease deed is only a source of power, underlining how there is no definition of ‘neighbourhood’ or ‘locality’ in either the allotment letter or lease deed. It said suddenly the government cannot come out with a unilateral condition “based on a single term in the allotment letter which has existed for several decades” but was either not insisted upon or the policy of schools to give preference on the ground of neighbourhood in terms of some extra points was taken as sufficient compliance.
 
 “If the state has not found the reason of public interest i.e. traffic congestion, pollution or health of child to be good and compelling reason to introduce neighbourhood criteria on 1400 schools not on DDA land, it can’t claim to achieve the said public interest only in case of 298 private unaided schools ,” court said.
