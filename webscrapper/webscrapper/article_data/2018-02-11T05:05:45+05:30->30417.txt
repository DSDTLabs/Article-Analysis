NEW DELHI:   has initiated a corruption probe against executives of the Indian subsidiary of US-based firm CDM   and unidentified officials of highway authority   in a case of alleged bribery of over $1 million to secure various contracts. 

  TOI had first reported the irregularities on July 11 last year. Boston-based consultancy firm   has admitted to the justice department of the US that its officials paid a bribe of $1.18 million (close to Rs 7 crore) to NHAI officials between 2011 and 2016. 
 
  CDM Smith has agreed to pay over $40,00,000 (approximately Rs 25 cr) to the US treasury, which it earned as profit from "illegally obtained works" for highway construction supervision and design contracts and a water project contract in Goa. The company will pay the amount in four instalments by October 1, 2017, an official communication from the US justice department had said. CBI, after registering an FIR, carried out searches in Bengaluru and Chennai including offices of CDM Smith and residence of then director finance of its Indian subsidiary, Gopakumar, since this morning, the officials said. 
 
  CBI has named in its FIR the US-based company; its Indian subsidiary CDM Smith India Private Limited based in Bengaluru; Gopakumar; the then manager of RV Infra Solutions, Krishnamurthy; and other unidentified executives of the company, its Indian arm and the NHAI, they said. It is alleged that in order to cover up the bribery, accused officials of CDM Smith showed these expenses as "allowable business expenses" in their income tax returns, they said.
