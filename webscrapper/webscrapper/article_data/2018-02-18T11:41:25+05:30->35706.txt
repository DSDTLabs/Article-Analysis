VISAKHAPATNAM: Permanent measures to check   are likely to be put in place by next year once Deltares - the consultant from Netherlands roped in to study the erosion along the city’s coastline - submits its report to the government by the end of this year.

 Deltares had embarked on the study in December last year covering a large swathe of coastline from Gangavaram port to   area at Parawada where marine structures are located and Divis Labs near Bheemili.
 
 “Deltares would submit a Detailed Project Report (DPR) and an engineering design besides estimates. The consultant would carry out a systematic study of erosion and sea activity. The sea activity would be high during the months of May to October. So, they will study the conditions in detail,”   Port Trust (VPT) chairman MT   said. The works would be taken up by the government at a tentative cost of Rs 150 crore as part of the beach beautification drive.
 
 Beach erosion is on a high since 2015. Even a part of the beach road was damaged due to erosion. If the sand replacement were not done, the sea would come forward, the port chairman said.
 
 Krishna Babu said as per the studies, 271 km of the coast out of 974 km of the entire AP coast has been affected by the erosion.
