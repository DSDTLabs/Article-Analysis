The apparent dip in the sales of tender coconuts seems to reflect positively on the shops selling juices as well as aerated drinks which have been witnessing big crowds. Traders say fruits and summer foods have also been selling like hot cakes as usual. 

 A large number of vendors selling sugarcane juice, palmyra fruits, palm sap and sherbet can be seen on the city roads. While the demand is high, the price of palmyra fruit, which is available only in summer, has gone up. Sellers say that the season for the fruit has just begun and it will take some time to harvest more. While three pieces of palmyra fruits were sold at Rs 10 a couple of years ago, only two are being sold for the price now. However, people do not hesitate to spend money on it. They say that they get it only for a few months and prefer to taste it at least once. “This year people have started feeling the heat pretty early and the demand for the fruit has gone up. We are bringing only smaller quantities which get sold quickly,” said P S  , a seller from Palamedu.
 
 Similarly, the sales of watermelon has increased by Rs 15 and Rs 20 depending on the quality. A Manikandan, a marketing professional from  , said, “Our job requires me to be on the run throughout the day. With the rising temperature, my body dehydrates often and I keep consuming watermelon and butter milk, other than lots of water” he said.
 
 F Mahimairaj, a sugarcane juice vendor from  , said that the sales were overwhelming. People who came shopping got easily tired and consumed a chilled drink to refresh themselves. In the last one month, the sales had doubled, he said.
