MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the   on Tuesday ordered notice to the   collector on a petition seeking appointment of special public prosecutor from the panel of special public prosecutors drawn under the provisions of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities)Rules to conduct a case, in which deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam’s brother   is one of the accused.

 On December 7, 2012, one S Nagamuthu from the scheduled caste community, working as a priest in a temple in Thenkarai in Theni district, committed suicide by hanging. He had left a suicide note saying that a group of people including Raja was responsible for his suicide. That case was transferred to the principal district and sessions court, Dindigul, from the Theni court for trial. As the father of the deceased wanted to appoint advocate B Mohan of Erode as special public prosecutor in the case, the Theni collector did so. One V Saravanan who is also one among the accused in the case filed the petition. 
 
 When it came up for hearing before justice D Krishnakumar, the petitioner’s counsel told the court that the special public prosecutor Mohan informed the trial court that he would withdraw his appearance from the case and subsequently resigned his post besides giving his resignation letter to the Theni collector. 
 
 But, Mohan again told the trial court that he did not resign his post of special public prosecutor. His action was unsustainable in law. Besides, the collector before whom he had tendered his resignation letter, is duty bound to appoint a new special public prosecutor. But, he did not do it. 
 
 Seeking to appoint new prosecutor the petitioner sent a representation on December 18, 2017. But, there was no response to it, the counsel said. 
 
 Following it, the court ordered notice to the collector and adjourned the case. 
 
 It may be recalled that in an earlier occasion, another accused K Sivakumar filed a petition seeking to restrain Mohan from acting as special public prosecutor.
