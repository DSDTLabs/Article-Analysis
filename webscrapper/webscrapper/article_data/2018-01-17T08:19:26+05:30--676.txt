NEW DELHI: The   (PCI) has finally written to the Indian Olympic Association ( ) asking it to request the   (OC) to accept the entry of para powerlifter  , along with that of another male para powerlifter,  , for the   ( ) to be held in Australia from April 4 to 15. 
 had earlier written how PCI had ignored Sakina's credentials while sending names to the OC.

 However, while making this request, PCI seems to be ignorant of the qualification criteria set by the   (CGF). In a letter written by PCI's secretary general   to the IOA, the federation has requested the IOA "to arrange for the inclusion of two more powerlifters, one male (Jaideep) and one female (Sakina), whose performances are based on the recent World (para powerlifting) Championship held in Mexico City from December 2 to 8, 2017). "
 
 The eligibility period for the CWG selection is from September 1, 2015 to October 31, 2017, which effectively means that the performance of Sakina and Jaideep at the World Championship would not be taken into consideration by the OC. Thus, by pitching for Sakina's case on a performance which falls out of eligibility criteria, PCI seems to have done more harm than good to her chances. More so, because Sakina had competed in the 'up to 50kg category' in World championship and failed to clear her lifts.
 
 The request fails to mention that Sakina had won the bronze medal at the Glasgow CWG and silver at the Asian Open Championship in Almaty.
 
 A few eyebrows have also been raised at the PCI's intention on having Jaideep's name included in the squad as he doesn't have any international medal to boast of. He had participated in the Glasgow CWG as a discus thrower and started pursuing para powerlifting as late as 2016.
 
 "The two names have been forwarded following the IOA's assurance," a senior PCI official informed.
