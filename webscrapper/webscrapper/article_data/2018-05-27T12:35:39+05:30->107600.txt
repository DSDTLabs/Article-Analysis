TUTICORIN: Eighty-two-year-old P  , an anti-Sterlite protester from  , is lucky to have escaped the bullet but is filled with regret on how the boys who saved her got shot on the dreadful Tuesday. She was among the hundreds from the village in ward no 1 in   Corporation who marched more than 8km to the district collectorate.

 “I was very tired and faced difficulty in reaching the collectorate,” Kattiamma, who was the oldest citizen of the village to take part in the protest in the village for 51 days before joining the march to the collectorate, said. People of Pandarampatti joined the procession near the 3rd Mile and were among the first to head to the collectorate.
 
 It was very hard for Kattiamma to stand on her feet and was on the verge of falling down as she lost her balance. “Two boys as young as my grandchildren caught hold of both my shoulders and almost carried me for a distance. Else I would have got killed by a bullet or in the stampede. As the gun firing got closer they told me to stay safe and fled for their lives,” she added.
 
 Seconds later both the boys suffered bullet injuries, which left one of them dead while the condition of the other is not known. She was confident that these boys did not have time for resorting to violence. Kattiamma is among the women in the village who have now spearheaded the anti-Sterlite protest despite the clamping of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedures, prohibiting the assembly of five or more people.
 
 The villagers said that there are more than 1,000 families in the village that is about two kilometres from Sterlite.
