CHENNAI: The   on Monday refused to grant interim stay against the order passed by the Madras   directing the   government to shut down 1,700   shops opened along highways falling under municipal areas across the state.

 On April 28, the high court passed the order noting that the process followed in permitting such shops were not in accordance with the Supreme Court order.
 
 When the special leave petition moved by the state government came up for hearing, the bench headed by Chief Justice   observed that the government has misinterpreted the courtâ€™s order permitting such shops along the highways passing through municipal areas.
 
 The court made it clear that the representations to establish such shops should be decided on a case to case basis by the state considering all relevant factors.
