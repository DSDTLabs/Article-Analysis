PUNE: A   at a prime location in   is causing headaches for residents. 

 The shop, located on the on the stretch from Marrakesh towards  , is the reason for  , unruly behaviour by its patrons as well as littering. 
 
 There are frequent complaints from residents of the area that people buying liquor from the shop make a nuisance of themselves right in the open, and leave an unsightly mess in the form of empty liquor bottles and containers. police frequently act against those who park their bikes in a haphazard manner, blocking traffic. 
 
 The situation is at its worst in peak hours, especially from 6.30pm to 10pm.
 
 “Before the Supreme Court ban on sale of liquor within 500m of highways came into effect, there would be 15-20 bottles discarded on the road every day. But since the ban, the problem has just worsened. We see 50-60 bottles thrown around daily. There is a school nearby, and many children walk to school. This does not present a pretty picture so early in the morning,” said Purnima Joshi.
 
 Residents are also bothered by the shop’s customers drinking right there on the footpath. “The enforcement of the law in the area leaves a lot to be desired,” said a resident, “and most don’t care about the surroundings.”
 
 Another resident said, “The traffic department takes action once every 15 days. But our demand is to keep an eye here daily, for a few months, till the problem is solved.”
 
 Local corporator Yogesh Mulik said, “We do receive phone calls from residents regarding traffic congestion and liquor bottles being thrown outside the society. We are soon going to hold a meeting with all stakeholders, including the traffic police, and find a solution to the problem.”
