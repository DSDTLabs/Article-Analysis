HYDERABAD: Unplanned industrialisation in peripheral areas of the city has taken a toll on the quality of groundwater. Twenty areas within and outside   limits falling under   district have bad quality groundwater, where pollutants exceeded the maximum permissible limit prescribed by   (WHO) for drinking water.

 Areas with unplanned industries were worst hit in terms of groundwater quality. Medchal, Jeedimetla, Shamirpet, Ghatkesar and   top the list of polluted localities. "Rapid increase in population, urbanization and industrialization in Hyderabad resulted in drastic increase in water pollution," said the study published in the latest issue of International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology.
 
 Researchers from Government City College and Annamacharya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Hyderabad, collected groundwater samples before and after monsoon in Medchal, Jeedimetla, Shamirpet, Kapra, Keesara, Ghatkesar, Alwal,  , Dindigul,  , Kukatpally, Shapur, Fatehnagar, Bowenpally, Uppal, Nagole, Malkajgiri, Begumpet, Lothukunta and Cherlapalli. The research team comprising Gogula Srisailam, DW Narisinga, M Waseem and K Sunder Kumar compared the results with the quality standards set by WHO for drinking water and found that they contained pollutants in excess of the maximum permissible limit.
 
 
  
 
 Samples collected pre-monsoon from Medchal and Balanagar had more parameters exceeding drinking water quality standards. "Medchal has major water polluting sources in the form of many industries," stated the study report. In post-monsoon sample analysis, Medchal and Qutubullapur had parameters exceeding prescribed limits.
