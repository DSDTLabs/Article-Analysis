NEW DELHI: With an eye on the parliamentary elections next year, the chief of UP's   has launched what he called the first political party representing the influential Muslim sect.

 
 Called   (ISAL),   said his party has been launched in response to the dominance of Sunnis that has led to denial of due space to those from his sect. "This is a political party and it is but natural we will fight elections wherever we can. Presidents have been appointed in 16 states so far and we will reach out to the people in our community," Rizvi said at a press conference in Delhi. He added, "We are open to whichever party looks after the interest of the Shia community."
 
 Claiming that registration process with   has been initiated, Rizvi declared himself president, two others as vicepresident and 13 other people in the national executive committee of ISAL.
 
 Even though Rizvi tried hard to project himself and his newly formed party as having the support of Shias across the country, influential voices from the community do not seem to reflect that kind of support. He has faced much opposition over his statements in the recent past which are seen by certain quarters as anti-Muslim.
