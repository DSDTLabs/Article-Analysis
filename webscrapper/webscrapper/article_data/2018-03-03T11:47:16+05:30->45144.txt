DHARAMSHALA: Section-118 of   Land Reforms and Tenancy Act has become a hot issue between ruling   and Congress after Chief Minister   had hinted that his govt was mulling ways to amend this section which restrict outsiders to buy land in the hill state.

 Thakur hinted the move earlier this week during his tour to Hamirpur district.
 
 On Friday, CM Jairam Thakur said that amendments were only aimed to ease the developmental projects in Himachal Pradesh. Thakur was on tour to  , he said this while talking to media persons here.
 
 “We have no ulterior motive behind amendments. The only aim is to execute the developmental projects, there are many which have stuck due to complications of this section” he said adding that Congress leaders don’t think before issuing statements against his govt.
 
 Leader of Congress legislative party, Mukesh Agnihotri, opposing this move has declared that they will resist if govt tries to do anything with this section. 
 
 “This move is not going to benefit the public of this state anyway. BJP is doing this just to benefit their people” he said this week at Una.
 
 Section 118 restricts the transfer of the land in favor of a person who is not an agriculturist of this state. It means the person who has no agricultural land in his name can’t purchase land in state in his name.
 
 According to the rules, even bona-fide residents of this hill state find it tough to get land holdings in their name. One has to do a lot of paper work to get permissions under this section to purchase land in Himachal due to this section.
