MARGAO/VERNA: Verna police booked former tourism minister Francisco Xavier ‘Mickky’   for allegedly damaging a parachute belonging to Fanny da Silva of Betalbatim.

 Police on Monday had booked a non-cognisable offence, but a video went viral on Tuesday which showed that the victim questioned Pacheco and was allegedly abused and almost attacked by the former   and his friends. 
 
 Verna police said the case has now been registered under Sections 336, 504, 506 II read with 34 IPC. Pacheco, on Tuesday, said that he breached no law when he drove his four-wheel drive vehicle on Majorda beach, as he had been called to a shack to take a patient to hospital. “No ambulance or fire brigade is able to reach any spot on the beach. I was called to save a life, I don’t think I made any mistake. If I did, there are authorities to take action against me,” he said.
