Wearing one colour from top to bottom is no easy feat – one wrong move and you can look like a crayon stick. But done right, it can add a sophisticated, chic vibe to your wardrobe.
 
  
 
  “If you aren’t ready for risk-taking with bright colours and sorbets, go full tone-on-tone in a nude or a cream,” says designer Vedika Merh. The right way to go about this look is to choose a colour scheme: meaning pick one colour, but don’t forget to pay attention to the shades. Then layer it with different shades, by mixing heavy and light fabrics. Designer Mrinalini Rao believes that solid colours give you the freedom to work on detailing and design. Her advice: Experiment with cuts, drapes, asymmetry, layers and textures. “With just one colour, it all looks understated yet glamorous,” she adds.
  
  
 
  When wearing the ‘solid’ style, keep your hair, make-up and accessories simple. “When picking a bright-coloured outfit, keep the extras minimal. However, if you are going with a neutral colour like white or black, feel free to play around with jewellery, hair and make-up,” says designer  . To add drama to the look, pair with bright shoes, a metallic bag or belt of a contrasting colour.
