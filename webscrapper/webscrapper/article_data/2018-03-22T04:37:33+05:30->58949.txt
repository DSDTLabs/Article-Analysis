MUMBAI: There will be no change in the status of   after it is included in the   (DP), said housing minister   on Wednesday. The park, he said, was always a part of Dharavi, but was excluded when the slum was carved into five sectors for redevelopment. Also, in  , the government will have a 51% equity share and 49% will be given to a developer to be appointed through a global tender. Since 1997, this is the seventh attempt by the government to change Dharavi’s fortunes.

 “Since the DP is now being prepared, it was decided to include the park in the plan. But there is no change in reservation. It will remain a park and will not be built upon,” Mehta said. SVR Srinivasan, principal secretary, information technology, who has additional charge of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, said the government’s notification mentions the park’s status as nature park and the proposed reservation is the same. “By default it was excluded. Now that it has been included means it gets statutory protection,” he said.
 
  
 Mehta said the government has decided to scrap Dharavi’s five-sector development plan, take back land given to Mhada for sector 5 and develop the entire area as a whole. He said that for this a special purpose vehicle is being created. “Since the government is a partner, bank guarantee should not be a problem,” he said.
 
 FSI for Dharavi will be 4. This was announced by the Vilasrao Deshmukh government when it declared Dharavi as a vital project for Mumbai. The rehabilitation portion alone is estimated to cost Rs 25,000 crore and it would take at least 10-15 years to complete the entire project. 
 
 Mehta said a separate zone with special status offering financial concessions will be set transit buildings and accommodate 3,000 families. Another 3,000 families will be shifted to Mahul, where there are SRA tenements. Those who arrived in Dharavi after 2000 will be covered under the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana.
