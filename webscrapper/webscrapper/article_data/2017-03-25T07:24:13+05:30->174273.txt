NEW DELHI: The   Bill, 2013, aimed at decriminalizing attempted suicide and defining mental illness in a broader and more inclusive way , was tabled in the   by Union health miniter J P   on Friday.

 While recognizing suicide attempts as a cry for help, the bill also bans the use of shock therapy for treating children with mental illness.
 
 However, the most remarkable feature of the bill is the provision of advance directives. The bill allows people to choose someone who can take care of them or method of treatment if they suffer mental illness in future. In other words, people suffering from mental illness will have the right to choose their mode of treatment by nominating representatives who will ensure that their choices are carried out.
 
 “This bill is progressive in nature and it is patientcentric. It empowers the patient for mental healthcare. And the purpose is to give treatment at community level,“ Nadda said while moving the bill in the lower house.
 
 The bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha in August, 2016.Seen as a reformist bill, it was hugely applauded on social media. Once passed in the Lok Sabha, the new bill will replace the outdated   Act of 1987. This would repeal Section 309 of the IPC which provided for year-long imprisonment for a failed suicide bid.
