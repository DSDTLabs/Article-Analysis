AHMEDABAD:   Ravjibhai, a lifer convicted for the rape and murder of a five-year old, may leave jail after 17 years, as   high court held that it is open for the state government to consider his request for a pardon of his remaining jail term.

 The advisory board and jail authorities were of the opinion that Trikam should be released as he had completed a 14-year term, after being awarded life imprisonment by the high court.
 
 In 1999, Trikam was first handed the death penalty by a trial court in Nadiad. In 2000, the high court commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment for the case of murder. Trikam was also serving life imprisonment for rape. After 14 years in jail, Trikam requested remission of his sentence. The advisory board and jail authorities also gave positive opinions.
 
 Trikam’s case remained pending in HC for nearly three years because a similar issue was pending before the  , which in July 2014 asked all state governments to refrain from using their remission powers. A year later, the SC lifted this bar with the clarification that life term convicts cannot get remission if handed down punishment by the HC with fixed term or if there is specific mention that the convict shall remain in jail till he lives. The SC also said that convicts whose cases were probed by the CBI or who were convicted under a central law like Section 376 of IPC, for rape, could not get remission.
 
 In Trikam’s case, a bench of Justice   and Justice   observed that the HC had not disturbed his conviction and sentencing for rape. 
 
 “It would therefore be open for the state authorities to consider the application for remission in terms of statutory provisions contained in the CrPC and the policy framed by the state government in this regard,” the bench said.
