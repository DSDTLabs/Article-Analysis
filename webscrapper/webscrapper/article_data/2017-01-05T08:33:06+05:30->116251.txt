NEW DELHI: A 30-year-old woman, accompanied by her one-year-old son, was at the centre of an unseemly commotion outside Reserve Bank of India on Parliament Street on Wednesday. When she was denied entry into the bank to deposit Rs 5,000 in old currency notes, she had an argument with the policemen there. In a video shot by a bystander, the woman is then seen physically resisting the attempts of the cops to lead her away before resorting to stripping in front of the gathered crowd. 

 Sources said the woman had been waiting outside RBI to get her old invalidated currency notes exchanged for new ones. But on being stopped at the gates, she started shouting at the cops and the others who were trying to stop her from creating a nuisance.
 
 The video showed the woman trying to instigate the crowd while trying to gain entry into the bank. Her son can be seen standing and crying beside the mother. When two women cops stepped in to try and pull the woman into a police van, she put up a resistance and manhandled the cops instead. 
 
 After repeated attempts by police to escort the woman away, the video showed the woman falling down, in the process pulling the women cops down too. She is then seen kicking them while they attempt to make her stand up.
 
 It was after this that she took her son by his hand and stood in front of the main gate of RBI, and then after hurling a stream of abuses at the police, started stripping in the presence of a big crowd that had gathered by then. All this while, her son can be seen standing next to her and weeping.
 
 The cops finally managed to cajole her into leaving the place. No complaint was lodged against her, neither was she taken into custody.
