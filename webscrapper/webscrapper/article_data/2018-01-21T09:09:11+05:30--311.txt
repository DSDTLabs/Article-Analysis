HYDERABAD: Two software professionals, who abused policemen clicking their photographs at a bar operating beyond the permissible time at   on Friday night, were arrested on Saturday. Later, they were sent to judicial custody. 

 Around 12.10am, constable   and home guard Mahaboob found Holi Bar at Kothaguda still open. They entered the bar and started taking photographs as evidence. On seeing the two policemen taking their photos, two customers -   and Abhinash Prasad- raised objection and picked up an argument with them.
 
 When Ramesh and Mahaboob told them they were policemen, Varun, who was already drunk, started abusing them in the most filthy language and even showed aggression and tried to reach Ramesh. Mahaboob tried to clam down Varun, but he refused to stop and continued to show aggression. The entire episode was captured by Ramesh on his phone. On the other hand, Abhinash too started recording the policemen's 'action' in support of his friend. 
 
 The two policemen alerted the Madhapur police station and a team reached the bar and took the two into custody. On Saturday evening, they were formally arrested. Madhapur police said Varun Wadaygiri and   were arrested under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and were later sent to judicial remand.
