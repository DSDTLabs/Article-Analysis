NEW DELHI: A   looted the driver of a Uber cab after attacking him with a blade at Vasant Kunj on Monday night. The police tracked them down to Kishangarh and recovered Kundan’s belongings within 12 hours. It was found that in January the same gang robbed another   after taking him to an isolated place in Mehrauli.

 According to Kundan, Rohit Kumar had booked the cab from CR Park asking for a drop at Vasant Kunj. Two men, the other identified as Sunny Balhara, boarded the cab and directed Kundan to take a longer route instead of the one through Outer Ring Road. Kundan said that even after reaching Vasant Kunj, he was given any specific address and made to go on same roads a couple of times. 
 
 Finally, they asked him to stop at a secluded spot near Kishangarh and got off the vehicle. When Kundan asked for the fare, the men started abusing him. When the driver protested, the men started thrashing him and one of them slashed his face with a blade. The duo then took Kundan’s wallet of his pocket as well as the mobile phone and fled.
 
 After Kundan informed the police from the mobile phone of a passerby, he was taken to a hospital. A team led by SHO Vasant Kunj (north) Gagan Bhaskar tracked down the gang by analysing call details, said additional DCP Chinmoy Biswal. A robbery case has been registered and the accused have been arrested.
