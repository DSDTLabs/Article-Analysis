Bicholim: Activists of Bharatiya Bhasha Suraksha Manch (BBSM), Bicholim unit, have demanded that the state government fulfill their demand of stopping grants to English medium primary schools. A protest meeting was held at Bicholim near Shri Shantadurga high school against the state government’s policy to support English language schools, instead of supporting Marathi and Konkani. Senior teacher Mukund Kauthankar criticized the government policy which he said endangers the existence of government primary schools in Goa.  He said the government is acting against the universal concept of imparting education in the mother tongue.  Others who spoke included BBSM Bicholim unit’s Srikrishna Dhond, BBSM district member Vinayak Chari and Atmaram Gaonkar.
