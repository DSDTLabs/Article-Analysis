PATNA: On a day when people from all sections of the society in Bihar joined hands to support the liquor ban in the state, the  , the red light area in Muzaffarpur town, did not lag behind and form  .

 At least 250   of the area joined the   to propagate the massage of CM   on prohibition. However, a number of them covered their faces to hide their identity. The area, which people say, exists since the Mughal period, is home to more than 2,500 sex workers. 
 
 A 30-year-old sex worker, while talking to TOI on phone, said even though prohibition had drastically hit their daily income, they participated on their own in the human chain as the government’s decision had brought back happiness to a large number of poor people and families. “People do come to us after prohibition, but they don’t throw notes on us as they used to in an inebriated condition,” she said. 
 
 “Many families have started having two square meals after prohibition,” she said, adding that her mother and grandmother were in the same business.
 
 Pale Khan (32), a social worker born and brought up at Chaturbhuj Sthan, said the area was a peaceful place on this New Year as fights and scuffles among customers were a routine affair earlier. “Drunk customers used to pick up fights every now and then, but now things have changed,” Khan said, adding that the sex workers voluntarily came out to form human chain.
 
 Khan said though the organisation he used to work for was shut down eight years back, he continued to work for the betterment of these women who are considered a social stigma.
