THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: I am fed up with explaining to people the idea behind the work ‘Yakshi’, said renowned   Kanayi Kunhiraman here on Wednesday. 

 Kanayi was addressing a gathering of people who attended the   programme organized to celebrate his 80th birthday, by the Bharat Bhavan and Kerala Arts Lovers Association Trust, at Kanakakunnu Palace.
 
 “Many have termed the sculpture   obscene. But I believe nudity is the truth. Even after the protests and attacks, my work is still protected in the state. It helped me understand better the other aspects of my work, its significance and the importance given to art by people in the state,” said Kanayi Kunhiraman.
 
 The valedictory function of the three-day-event was inaugurated by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday. “It is not just the government, but it is the people who are paying tribute to the artist for his contributions. His masterpiece ‘Yakshi’, depicts freedom of women. He was attacked and threatened for his work. Art will only flourish in an environment devoid of fear,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, while inaugurating the event.
 
 An exhibition of around 50 odd photographs of   by photographer Jithesh Damodar, were among other highlights of the event. 
 
 Mullakkara Ratnakaran MLA presided over the function. It was also attended by mayor V K Prasanth. In addition to discussions on art and seminars, cultural programmes were also organized as part of the event.
