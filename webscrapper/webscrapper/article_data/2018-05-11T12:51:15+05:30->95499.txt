MARGAO: Most villages in South Goa suffered major power outages following a brief spell of heavy rains and thunderstorm that hit Goa in the wee hours of Thursday. Personnel of the fire services and electricity department were on their toes throughout the day on Thursday clearing roads, restoring traffic, and saving property.

 In Margao, a traffic hoarding near the KTC bus stand collapsed and fell bang on the road damaging a street light pole and parallelizing traffic along the route for a brief while. In the coastal belt of   from Cavelossim to Majorda, trees came crashing down on power lines and public roads at several places. In Colva, Varca, Benaulim and Betalbatim, the road was partially blocked due to falling of trees which was soon cleared.
 
 While altogether 11 electricity poles in Salcete’s coastal belt were damaged leading to snapping of power lines, at least seven electricity poles in all, fell down in Sarzora, Chinchinim, Betul, Assolna and Dramapur, sources said.
 
 In Cuncolim, power officials faced trouble as just the day after they had replaced the damaged transformer following public outcry over long spells of power outages, the feeder of the newly-replaced transformer tripped on account of the lightning leading to power failure. 
 
 Incidents of trees and electricity poles falling on the roads were reported in Assolna, Velim, Sirvodem and Khareband in Margao, Dongrim and   in Navelim, and Cuncolim, Vastawada and Bagwada in Curchorem, Dhadem in Sanvordem, Gudi, Paroda, Xelvon, Dharbandora, Shigao and Panchwadi. 
 
 In  , a huge mango tree collapsed on the house of Francis Pereira, bringing down alongwith it an electricity pole, causing extensive damage.
 
 At Vasco, a part of a ‘sajja’ of Mormugao Municipal Council building collapsed, a tree uprooted at Baina, while a coconut tree fell on a house at Chicalim.
