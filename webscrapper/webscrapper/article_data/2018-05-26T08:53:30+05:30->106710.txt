NEW DELHI: Former India captain   believes that team work is at the core of Chennai Super Kings’ run to the final of  , which is their seventh appearance at the summit of the lucrative Twenty20 league. 

 
 
 
 Having retained the titanic trio of skipper  , No 3 batsman Suresh Raina and allrounder Ravindra Jadeja before the auction in January, Chennai’s think-tank then bought back key contributors Dwayne Bravo, Faf du Plessis and Murali Vijay apart from making some smart buys in South African pace bowler Lungi Ngidi, England batsman Sam Billings and seamers Deepak Chahar and Shardul Thakur, each of whom has had a role in victories this season. 
 
 
  
 
 “It should come as no surprise that   are in the seventh final out of the nine seasons they have competed in. The formula for success is simple: fight as a unit rather than be dependent on the same set of players in all matches,” wrote Srikkanth, who captained India in four Test matches and 13 ODIs, in his column for The Times of India. 
 
 “No amount of praise is enough for MS Dhoni for making his players believe that nothing works better than a collective force. Chennai’s happy state is also due to the fact that each player knows his responsibility and role.”
 
 Recalling his own experience as part of the Indian ODI team that lifted the 1983 World Cup and the World Championship of Cricket two years later in Australia, Srikkanth equated these successful units with other ICC trophy-winning Indian teams and  , who have won the   twice. 
 
 “Looking back at India’s four major limited-over crowns, the 1983 and 2011 World Cup, the 2007 World T20 and the 1985 WCC, one thing is ascertained, nothing works like team work. In all these wins, there would have been some brilliant individual performances, but what mattered in the end was the entire unit pulling its weight together. For this reason alone, CSK stands clear of the other teams in the history of the IPL,” he wrote.
