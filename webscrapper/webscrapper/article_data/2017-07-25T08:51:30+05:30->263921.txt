NEW DELHI: Shankersinh Vaghela’s exit from the   will not have much impact as the party has been preparing for a fight without him for three months, but the perception that the party is indecisive and unprepared might hurt, senior congress leaders told ET.
 
  “Jab samundramanthan hota hai, toh sabse pehle vish bahar nikalta hai (When sea churning happens, the poison from the pot goes out first)” a congress party member said, explaining that worse could have happened with Vaghela’s exit but fortunately for the party, “now there was one CM candidate less for the party to consider.”
  
  But the party leaders do feel that at a time the Congress should have been talking about floods and how   could have handled it differently, it was all becoming about how “Vaghela was walking into the sunset, but not without giving a blow to the Congress.” Vaghela in the last few months had met Congress president Sonia Gandhi over his dissatisfaction with the party.
  
  He had also been offered a RS seat by Congress. “His main problem was with PCC chief  . He wanted complete say in ticket distribution and was looking at CM candidature,” the leader added.
  
  According to most Congress leaders in Gujarat, the party did the right thing by not giving in to the demands of Vaghela which would have sent more fissures among other leaders.
  
  “Most of us are glad that it was not another Narhari Amin episode where in there was not even time to manage the crisis.” Amin, a former Congress leader and deputy CM, had quit the Congress on the eve of December 2012 assembly elections and joined the BJP after he was denied ticket. “Now the party can focus on local factors,” the leader said.
  
  Vaghela has not made his future plans clear except to say he won’t join the BJP. But political analysts believe that he will be in alliance with the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) after forming an outfit of his own, mostly third front.
