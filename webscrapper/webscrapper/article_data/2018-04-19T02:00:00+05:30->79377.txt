GAYA: With the mercury crossing the 40 degree mark and the dipping water level, water supply has been hit in several areas of the town. 

 As per rough estimate, tap water is available to only 40% of nearly 70,000 municipal holdings and the remaining 60% Gayaites depend on pumped ground water. The water is pumped either through tubewells or submersible pumps.
 
 Confirming water scarcity in the town, mayor Birendra Kumar said, “Altogether   have already been pressed into service. These tankers are owned by the municipal body. The Gaya Municipal Corporation (GMC) would requisite more tankers from public health and engineering department (PHED) soon. Areas like Ramshila, Gewalbigha and part of Rampur are the few areas which are worst hit.”
 
 Experts said that the situation is bound to deteriorate till the monsoon breaks. “Only a heavy downpour not only in Gaya but Chatra district of neighbouring Jharkhand can redeem the situation,” said Lalji Prasad, a former member of the standing committee of the Gaya Municipal Corporation. Falgu river originates in Chatra.
 
 Apprehending further worsening of the situation, Prasad said, “A private company that installed high power pumps in Falgu river bed was mandated to lower the submersible pumps 80 feet deep. But the pumps have been lowered only 40 feet deep. Dipping water table is bound to reduce and may even dry up the source,” said Prasad. 
 
 Earlier, Gaya MLA and the then urban development minister Prem Kumar came out with the proposal to link Falgu with Ganga near Fatuha to ease the water crisis. Gaya MP Hari Manjhi too had demanded linking of Falgu with Sone. Both the proposal has made little head way.
