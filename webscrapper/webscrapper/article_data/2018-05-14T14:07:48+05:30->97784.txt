SURAT: More than 2,250 industrial plot holders in   industrial area have opposed the new block rates of assessment which have been declared by the state government. The plot holders now will have to pay 25% higher construction tax. The total tax billing has risen to Rs 22 crore from Rs 17.5 crore in Sachin. 

 Sachin Industrial Cooperative Society secretary   told TOI, “This change has not just affected plot holders in Sachin but also 31 other industrial areas in the state. Twenty five per cent hike in assessment rate of construction was decided at a meeting on February 19. This is not acceptable to us because we have not be taken into confidence. We have total budget of Rs 18 crore in Sachin. How can we pay up Rs 22 crore in taxes?” asked Golwala. He has written to the state government officials saying that the industry is yet to come out of recession caused by demonetization and implementation of GST. He has requested revoking of the latest hike in block rates. tnn
