PATNA: The   (ED) on Saturday attached properties worth around Rs 5 crore of Amit Kumar alias   for his alleged involvement in money laundering. 

 Bachcha hit the headlines in 2016 when the   (BSEB)’s topper scam rocked the state. The scam involved the BSEB officials who, allegedly in lieu of monetary gratification from the likes of Bachcha, helped undeserving students top the Class XII examination. 
 
 Many toppers belonged to   in Vaishali district, which was run by Bachcha. He is currently in jail.
 
 According to an ED press release, the attached assets include Bachcha’s 16 plots of land worth Rs 1.99 crore at Lalganj, Mahua, Bhagwanpur and Hajipur and five bank accounts with around Rs 55 lakh as deposit.
 
 The ED also attached 13 other plots worth Rs 1.05 crore of Bachcha’s wife Sangeeta Rai at Lalganj, Mahua, Bhagwanpur and Hajipur, a two-storey building in her name at Hajipur, her flat at Sarnaam Apartment in Mainpura locality of Patna and her three bank accounts with Rs 17.24 lakh as deposit.
 
 Two other bank accounts with deposits of Rs 39.01 lakh were also attached. These accounts are in the name of Bachcha’s minor daughter. “All these properties were amassed through the topper scam,” said an ED official.
 
 ED sources told TOI they had also come to know about Bachcha’s flats and houses in Noida, Jharsuguda (Odisha) and Seraikela (Jharkhand). “We are in the process of attaching them as well,” the ED official said.
 
 Besides Bachcha, former BSEB chairman Lalkeshwar Prasad Singh, secretary Harihar Nath Jha, Rajendra Balak High School principal Visheshwar Prasad and school’s mathematics teacher Sanjeev Kumar Suman are also behind bars in connection with the scam.
 
 The ED official said their inquiry into the properties of Lalkeshwar and his wife Usha Sinha, who has since been granted bail, was on.
