NEW DELHI:   (e-PoS) devices installed at fair price shops in Burari were found deficient in a surprise inspection by food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain. The department has been directed to take strict action against those found guilty of dereliction of duty.

 The government had recently announced a city-wide rollout of a month-long trial of ration disbursal through PoS   at all 2,254 fair price shops starting January 1. The new system can verify beneficiaries through Aadhaar authentication.
 
 “The shortcomings were noticed at nine fair price shops. There was connectivity problem at some of the shops leading to delay in distribution of ration to the beneficiaries. The system also hanged at some places when the e-PoS device was connected to electronic weighing machine. At one shop, the e-PoS device was sent for repairs,” said a press statement by Delhi government.
 
 In addition, four fair price shops were found not displaying the mandatory information on display boards at their premises. One shop was found locked during the working day. The minister issued directions to the food and civil supplies commissioner seeking explanation from   regarding the discrepancies and irregularities found at the five shops. Hussain also directed the commissioner to take disciplinary action against delinquent officials for gross negligence.
