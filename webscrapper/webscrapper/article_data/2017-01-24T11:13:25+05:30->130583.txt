HYDERABAD: From just a handful two years ago, the count of killer `black spots' in the city has shot to alarmingly high levels now, say  . While the Hyderabad belt has 84 such spots ­ it had 25 previously the number in Cyberabad has jumped from 5 to 29.

 A 'black spot' is usually defined as a small stretch of road (up to 500 meters in length) that has recorded a high number of accidents and fatalities. These 'danger zones' are further divided into three categories: 'A' (more than 20 accidents), 'B' (more than 10 accidents) and 'C'(more than 5 accidents).
 
 Shocked by the  , traffic cops have now undertaken a massive 'rectification' drive to fix these ' ' ­ both in and around the city and in other districts of Telangana. Turns out, the state is sitting pretty on a staggering 316 `black spots', adding to the fears of commuters and monitoring authorities.
 
 The state road safety authority, while pegging the total number of accidents caused due to road engineering defects ­ that lead to the formation of `black spots' ­ at around 15 per cent, they confess that their impact is severe. In 2015, for instance, these deadly `road defects' were among the primary reasons for snuffing out 900-1,100 lives across the state.
 
 “The analysis of road accidents reveals that `drivers' fault' accounted for 77.1 per cent of road accidents, followed by road designing defects. Apart from surveillance and enforcement measures, engineering issues too need to be addressed as these defect-related accidents are mostly fatal and each time a large number of lives are lost,“ said T Krishnaprasad, additional DG, road safety (Telangana).
 
 Over the last few days, cops have managed to rectify these spots in Ramagundam, Suryapet and Karimnagar. No such action has been takenin the city .
