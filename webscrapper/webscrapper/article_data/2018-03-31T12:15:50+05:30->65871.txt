VISAKHAPATNAM: Amid the ongoing political tussle over the Special Category Status (SCS) for AP,   official spokesperson   on Friday said, "CM N Chandrababu Naidu should seek the resignation of his party MPs if he truly wants to achieve special category status for Andhra Pradesh." 

 Speaking to the media in party office in   on Friday, Prasad Reddy alleged Naidu saying that he is trying to weaken the SCS movement. "YSRCP Chief YS   has become successful in making SCS a national issue. Several other political parties, which earlier claimed that there will be of no use with the SCS, are now part of the movement due to the relentless fight of Jaganmohan Reddy." 
 
 "TDP leaders have been making baseless allegations against YSRCP MP V Vijaysai Reddy for the latter grabbing all the national attention for his sincere fight for SCS in Parliament. TDP should stop resorting to cheap politics and stop YSRCP's fight for SCS," he added. 
 
 Reddy further added that Vizag MP K Haribabu is in cahoots with Naidu. "Haribabu has never questioned the TDP over land scam or any other prevailing issues. In the name of development, they looted the resources of Visakhapatnam," he said.
