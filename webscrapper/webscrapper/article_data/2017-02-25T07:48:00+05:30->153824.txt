GURUGRAM: Commuters are using fake identity documents, including those of defence personnel, and vehicle registration certificates (RC), to escape paying user fee at the   toll plaza. Between 2015 and 2016, the number of such defaulters shot up to 583 from 365 in the previous year. 

 “The toll authorities have a centralised databank of people who have been exempted from paying the toll fee. Everytime an ID or RC is produced, the toll operator tallies it online. If the details are found to be fake, the documents are seized and forwarded to authorities concerned,” said  , chairman,  , the toll operator. 
 
 The authorities have exempted defence personnel and residents of 31 villages from paying the toll tax. Verifying the documents is time-consuming process and also puts an additional burden on the toll operator as authorities concerned have to be involved. 
 
 In 2016, the toll officials witnessed as many as 325 commuters using fake identity documents as compared to 290 such cases observed the previous year.
 
 According to officials, a police complaint is filed whenever the toll employees come across a commuter faking the ID of a defence personnel, which is viewed as threat to national security. Around 126 such complaints were registered with police in 2016, while 119 complaints in this category were filed in 2015.
