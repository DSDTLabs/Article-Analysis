POROVORIM: Chief minister Manohar   on Monday said that the government should constitute a small committee, consisting of MLAs, to look into the issue of the use of LED lights by trawlers for fishing, instead of constituting a   committee. 

 While some MLAs wanted the government to allow the use of LED lights a few others wanted the government to crackdown on its use. 
 
 Even as fisheries minister   replied to the demands saying that a House committee would be formed look into the issue, Parrikar intervened and said that there was no need for a House committee and that “it is better to have a small committee”.
 
 Paleykar said the state policy on marine fisheries would be developed on the lines of the national policy before August 31.
