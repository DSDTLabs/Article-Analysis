HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad High Court on Monday directed Telangana to state its stand on pleas challenging the government’s decision to accord upto 20 marks weightage to contract and outsourced employees in the ongoing recruitment of doctors, staff nurses, lab technicians in the health department and engineers in TS   on a regular basis.

 The Bench of Acting Chief Justice Ramesh Ranganathan and Justice K   said that it would like to expeditiously decide the dispute arising out of the decision of the state government to grant weightage marks to contract employees while filling up numerous vacancies in several departments. The cases will be listed next Monday.
 
 Senior counsel S   argued against any concession to the existing contract and outsource employees because that would adversely affect the chances of scores of unemployed people. He cited certain judgments that spoke against such concessions.
 
 Advocate general D   said that the cited judgments dealt the issue from the perspective of contract employees who were seeking such concessions. “The current context is not about that. Here is a case where the state itself has come forward with a policy to extend such weightage to contract employees,” the   said.
 
 The Bench was dealing with cases filed by several jobless youth. They complained that 20 weightage marks are being given while filling posts of staff nurses, medical officers, civil assistant surgeons and engineers of Transco. The petitioners complained that not only temporary contract staff, even outsourced employees were being given weightage.
 
 The Bench directed the government to file its counter affidavit by next Monday. The case will be taken up next week for adjudication.
