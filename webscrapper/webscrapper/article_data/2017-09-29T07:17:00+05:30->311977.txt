 Rachna Gupta, a Class 3 teacher, said, “The counselling session was very helpful. We were told not to brush aside the questions students ask, but to listen to them. We were also asked to be their friend so that they share their problems with us.” 
 
 Neha Sardana, a Class 5 teacher said, “We have noticed that many students don’t want to use the washroom after Pradhyumn’s death. During the session we were taught how to rebuild their confidence.” Teachers unanimously said that this was the first counselling session held for the faculty in the school. “I counselled 10 teachers. Most of them are traumatised. They told me that everybody approaches them with suspicious eyes. My advice to them was to relax and take deep breaths. I told them to answer parents politely when they ask questions,” said Dr Shweta Sharma.
