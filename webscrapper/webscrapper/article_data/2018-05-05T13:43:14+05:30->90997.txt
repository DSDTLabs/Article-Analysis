MADURAI: The   bench of the Madras high court has sought a response from the central and state governments on a plea seeking to trace a ship that killed a fisherman and Rs 1 crore compensation to his family.

 One M Nagammal filed a case. When it came up for hearing, the petitioner’s counsel said that fishermen in   in Ramanathapuram district were facing untold suffering at the hands of Indian and Sri Lankan navies.
 
 This led the petitioner’s husband Murugesan to do fishing work with one Mariya Nelson of Tharuvaikulam in Tuticorin district who is the owner of a mechanised boat. The petitioner’s husband worked there for five years.
 
 On January 25, he along with other fishermen went for fishing in the mechanised boat. On January 30, a ship that came in a rash manner hit the boat, due to which the boat sank in the water. The fishermen were rescued and given first aid by a merchant ship that came over there. However, the petitioner’s husband lost his life.
 
 The Colachel Marine police registered a case. However, police did not crack the case. The details of the ship that hit the boat could be easily traced, but has not been done. Thus, the central and state governments are vicariously liable for the death of the petitioner’s husband, for which they have to pay compensation to the petitioner’s family. Regarding that, a representation was sent to the officials concerned on March 28. But, there was no action on their part. Hence, it was necessary to direct the governments to take action to find out the ship and take action against it. tnn
