BHOPAL: A mother of 11 children in   district is fighting for her life after complications in her 14th pregnancy. 

 Sharda Prajapati, 35, of   village in   has had six sons and five daughters since being married as a child. Her eldest son is 24. Two of her kids died in infancy and one was aborted.
 
 Sharda's son and her sister-in-law, Pushpa, brought her to   on Wednesday morning. Medical examinations showed her uterus to be very weak and bleeding, doctors said. Realising that her condition was very critical, they decided to operate on her immediately to deliver the baby.
 
 "After the surgery, a 4-kg baby boy was born," said Dr Nina Gidian, the hospital in-charge. When gynaecologists tried to find out why she was in such a bad state of health, they were shocked to know she had 11 children. Dr Gidian said, "The baby in the womb was in a very bad shape because of heavy bleeding. We wanted to remove the uterus for the patient's betterment but it was not possible."
 
 The baby is in the special newborn care unit (SNCU), Gidian said. Sharda is in critical condition and battling for life.
