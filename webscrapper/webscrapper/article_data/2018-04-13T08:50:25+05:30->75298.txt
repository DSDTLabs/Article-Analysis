LUCKNOW: The second route of  , the eastwest (E-W) corridor, will have three-coach trains and smaller stations.

 According to the revised detailed project report (DPR) of the   which will run from Vasantkunj to Charbagh, this is being done to reduce construction cost since the state government wants to minimise the financial burden of upcoming Metro projects in UP.
 
 Unlike the E-W corridor, the north-south corridor has six-coach trains and larger stations.
 
  
 Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC), the interim consultant to Lucknow Metro Rail Corporation (LMRC), had prepared the DPR for E-W corridor in 2013. However, since then, the construction cost has escalated by 5-7% every year. As five years have passed, LMRC decided to revise it according to the present geographical, financial and structural situation.
 
 The revised DPR has been finalised as per the Centre’s new Metro Policy and will be presented to the state government soon.
 
 LMRC has proposed to complete the E-W corridor by September 2023 if it gets the nod for construction by 2019. The daily number of passengers projected for the corridor by 2023 is over 2 lakh.
 
 The stretch will have seven underground Metro stations and five elevated stations. An LMRC official said, “Since the expected number of passengers on E-W corridor is lesser than the N-S corridor, it is better to run threecoach trains and build smaller stations.”
 
 While the previous DPR pegged the total cost at Rs 5,500 crore, the revised cost has been pegged at Rs 6,500 crore for the E-W section.
