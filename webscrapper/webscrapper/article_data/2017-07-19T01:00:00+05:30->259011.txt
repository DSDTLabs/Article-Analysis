After treating audiences to fun trailers and peppy songs, team ' ' will release a video today, which offers a sneak peek into the crazy family of the comic caper. 
The movie, directed by Anees Bazmee, features  , Arjun Kapoor,   D'Cruz,   Shetty, Pawan Malhotra, Ratna Pathak Shah, Rahul Dev, Karan Kundra, Gurpal Singh and Lalit Parimoo in pivotal roles. 
 The film also promises a lot of interesting firsts. To begin with, it will mark real-life chacha-bhatija Anil-Arjun’s debut outing together. Their camaraderie, as seen in the trailer, has already garnered a lot of appreciation. That’s not all; this is the first time Anil will be seen as a Sikh. Arjun’s pairing with Ileana and Athiya has also added to the excitement. 
 While the trailer has already given a glimpse of the hilarious dialogues (Anil’s query, “Iss baar Christmas 25 December ko hai na?” is one example), the film promises much more to tickle your funny bone. 
 The makers are also happy that the songs -- the title song, 'Hawa Hawa', 'The Goggle Song' and 'Jat Jaguar' -- have become popular party numbers. 
 'Mubarakan', produced by   Networks Productions and Murad Khetani and   of Cine1 Studios, releases on July 28.
