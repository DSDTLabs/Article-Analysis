Pilerne: Litigation between tenants over cultivation of fields has delayed the desiltation of the Saulem lake in Pilerne, Bardez.

 Nestled beneath the serene village of Pilerne and flanked on both sides by lush green hills lies the famous Saulem lake in Pilerne. This tourist hotspot has become a nesting ground for the white cranes and migratory birds which wade through the waters. Even though this lake has attracted a number of birdwatchers, the attempts to desilt the lake still remain in the pipeline due to some litigation between the farmers and the tenants over the cultivation of the fields. Speaking to TOI, a local resident of Pilerne, Vinayak Saulekar said that the lake needs to be desilted so that the water from the spring buried beneath the lake’s bed could spurt out and fill the lake with water which can be used for irrigation facilities, boating, as well as supplying water to neighbouring villages. 
 
 When TOI contacted sarpanch of Pilerne, Amaranth Govekar he said that the Pilerne panchayat had moved a proposal for desilting the lake four years ago during the tenure of former tourism minister Dilip Parulekar, but the proposal had fallen flat due to litigation between the tenants over the cultivation of their fields. “The panchayat will take up the proposal of desilting after the case is settled,” said Govekar.
