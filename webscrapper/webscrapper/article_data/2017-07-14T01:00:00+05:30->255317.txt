Madhur Bhandarkar’s next, ' ', starring Kirti Kulhari, Tota Roy Chaudhary, Anupam Kher and Neil Nitin Mukesh, not only recreates the   of 1975, imposed by the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, but also attempts to transport the audience back in time through its music. After recreating the classic qawwali 'Chadhta Sooraj Dheere Dheere', and a soulful number, 'Yeh Aawaz Hai', composer Anu Malik has devised a retro track titled ' ' to add to the album’s range.
Sung by Bappi Lahiri and Anmol Malik, the song is written by Punit Sharma and is a foot-tapping number reminiscent of compositions created by   and Laxmikant-Pyarelal.
 Madhur says, “I wanted the music to be in sync with the story and the milieu. I’m a huge fan of Panchamda’s work. In a way, this song attempts to pay a   to him.”
 'Indu Sarkar', presented by Bharat Shah and produced by Mega Bollywood and Bhandarkar Entertainment, releases on July 28.
