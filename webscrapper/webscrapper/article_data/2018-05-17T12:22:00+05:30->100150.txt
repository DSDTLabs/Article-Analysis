PANCHKULA: Shree Mata   shrine authorities have been polluting the   bank near Chowki village by dumping a lot religious offerings since long. 

 They have been throwing items like chunni, bangles, nail polish, vermilion (sindoor) and comb, offered to the goddess in the temple by the devotees, along the river side in the open. 
 
 During a visit to the spot by team TOI on Wednesday, the villagers said every Navratra, the Mansa Devi officials carry the items, which they receive from devoteesin huge amounts, in tractor-trolleys to the Ghaggar bank and throw them on the spot openly.
 
 Although on one hand, the government is promoting Swacchh Bharat, there is no check on the pollution created by these temple authorities.
 
 The entire river bank has turned vermilion and the residents living nearby are facing problems due to the pollution that is choking the area.
 
 One of the villagers,  , said, “I have seen trolleys from Mansa Devi temple come here and dump all religious waste on the river belt. They do not even flow it in the river as per rituals. Thus all these pile up on the bank itself.”
 
 When contacted, the chief executive officer (CEO), Shree Mata Mansa Devi Shrine Board, V G Goel, said, “We have a complete disposal plan with us. Also, we usually hand over the offerings back to the devotees soon after prayer.”
 
 Sometimes, the devotees leave these items at the temple only and that is when the temple’s waste disposal team members flow it in the river as per rituals, Goel said . “We had thought of to bury the items in the temple complex itself but the pundits advised us to flow them in the river water,” Goel added. 
 
 “If the concerned people have thrown the offered items in the open, it is indeed a matter to worry. I will personally go and check the place tomorrow. A strict action will be taken on anyone who creates pollution,” said Goel.
