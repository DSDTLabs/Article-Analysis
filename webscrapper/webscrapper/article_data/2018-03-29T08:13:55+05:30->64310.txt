MEERUT: An eight-year-old girl died due to accidental hanging on Tuesday in UP's Hapur. Simran had gone to play with her friends in the neighbourhood after she was allegedly hit by her father,  , over some issue. 

  Simran and her friends started watching  , a crime-based TV show. "Simran later tried to enact one of the scenes where a woman had hanged herself. She stood on a bucket, tied a dupatta around her neck and was helped by others who were clueless about how this act could go horribly wrong," Hemant Kutiyal, Hapur SP, said. 
 
  Her friends watched her in horror when she slipped and the bucket tumbled. As she struggled for breath, her friends, who were around the same age, panicked and ran away. After some time, they came back to the room and managed to bring down her body. Petrified, they covered her body with empty jute bags lying around and fled. 
 
 Pankaj Lavania, Hapur Kotwali station officer, said, "Her body was discovered later when the family of deceased began a frantic search for the missing girl." "We initially suspected the role of the family, but later the children narrated the entire incident," the SP said.
