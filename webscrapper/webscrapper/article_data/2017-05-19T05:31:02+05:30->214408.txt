BHOPAL: Former general secretary of   Govind Goyal demanded to shift all liquor shops outside the limits of   corporation. The liquor vends should down their shutters at 7pm every day, Goyal demanded. 

 Staging a protest against liquor shops on Thursday, Congress leader led a group of men and women at the alcohol shop at   near   and distributed milk asking people to shun alcohol.
 
 Protesting against the liquor shop, women went inside the ahata , a hall adjacent to liquor shop for drinking and distributed butter milk to people drinking inside the hall. 
 
 Goyal said if the government really wants to discourage liquor, vends selling liquor should be closed at 7 pm. But the fact remains, the shops in the state open at 9 in morning and booze business goes on till midnight. " Violating all norms, country-made liquor is available at India Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) shop in Bhopal," he alleged.
 
 On one hand, the chief minister says he is for prohibition, on the other hand, liquor sale is promoted by extending business hours at vends, he alleged. He said during the agitation at   shop last week, Congress workers found that country-made liquor was being sold at the IMFL shop.
