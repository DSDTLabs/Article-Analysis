CHANDIGARH: A man who eloped with a underage girl last year was on Thursday held guilty of   in a district court here.

 Additional district and session judge   held   guilty under Section 376 (punishment for rape), 366 (kidnapping, abducting or inducing a woman to compel her for marriage) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 4 and 8 of the POCSO (Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences) Act. The court will pronounce the quantum of sentence on Friday.
 
 The matter dates back to August 2016 when the convict was booked by police on the complaint of the minorâ€™s father. The victim is reported to be 17 years old. The complainant had reported her minor daughter missing and told police that Om Parkash might have kidnapped her. It was proved in the court that Om   used the pretext of marriage to lure the girl into eloping with him. Police caught them later near the Chandigarh railway station.
 
 During the trial, the minor victim turned hostile as witness, and stated that she had gone with the man by her own will. Still, the medical report confirmed rape and so the man had to be sentenced. On Thursday, he was convicted, and the detailed sentence will be pronounced on Friday.
