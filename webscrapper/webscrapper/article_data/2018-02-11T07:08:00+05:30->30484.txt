Ludhiana: Renowned Punjabi singer and music composer Sukhshinder   visited Ludhiana to support the ‘I Vote, I Lead’ voter awareness campaign ahead of the municipal corporation elections. The pop star was hosted by Harjinder Singh Kukreja, a social activist, and the team of Initiators of Change at a venue in Sarabha Nagar market. The team of youngsters executing the campaign for Ludhiana were also present on the occasion.

 Addressing the media, Shinda said: “I’m extremely happy to be a part of this movement, and support the ‘I Vote, I Lead’ campaign. Voting is a right we have achieved after a struggle for hundreds of years, and not using it is itself an insult to the nation’s freedom fighters, who died fighting for this right. We must all go out and vote smartly, by reading and knowing about our candidates.”
 
 Kukreja said: “It is wonderful that public figures and celebrities like Shinda are supporting democratic values, and have come out to campaign for a higher voter turnout in the upcoming elections. The youth follow celebrities like Shinda, and will definitely go out to vote on his appeal.”
 
 Talking about the campaign, Gauravdeep Singh (founder of Initiators of Change) said: “We have been running voter awareness campaigns for the past three elections, and have been highly successful in creating a positive impact in the minds of Ludhiana’s citizens towards voting and its importance. We are thankful to personalities like Shinda and Kukreja who took time out to support a cause for the youth.”
