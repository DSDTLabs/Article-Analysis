An almost jam-packed   echoed with spurts of giggles and chuckles when  , standup comedian, cracked jokes on every profession. Patnaites were in splits for three hours, pausing occasionally to catch their breath. Audience gave a thumbs up to Amit Tandon’s joke on doctor’s wedding. A bevy of Patna’s literati and intellectuals had come to watch his performance. After three hours of non-stop laughter, the comedian was swarmed by the audience for selfies which he happily obliged.
