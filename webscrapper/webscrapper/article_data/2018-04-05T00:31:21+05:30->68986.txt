Tuticorin: The disqualification of their MLAs has put paid to all hopes of the local people of Ottapidaram and Vilathikulam assembly segments in Tuticorin district to get their long-pending issues addressed. 

 These include the drinking water crisis and better irrigation system. However, residents of these assembly segments say they have grown used to the empty promises made during election campaigns.
 
 Ottapidaram MLA R Sundararaj said that some of the works such as construction of the storm water drains announced by J Jayalalithaa for Rs 73 crore following floods in Tuticorin in 2015 had not kickstarted. 
 
 “Roads that got damaged in the floods in Muthammal Colony, Adhiparasakthi Nagar, Nethaji Nagar that come under Ward No. 1, 2 and 5 in Tuticorin corporation are still in a very bad share,” he said. Sundararaj accused the chief minister and local minister Kadambur C Raju of showing favouritism for executing various schemes. 
 
 He also said that eight months ago he had allotted Rs 1.1 crore from his MLA fund for drinking water schemes in his assembly segment so that the works would have been completed before summer, but they had not started. 
 
 The disqualified MLA also said that he would have raised the Sterlite issue in the assembly as the company’s area under expansion and the villages where the protest was taking place fell in his assembly segment. 
 
 “Had Amma been the   she would have closed the plant by now. I have taken the issue to the notice of our party leader (TTV Dinakaran),” he added. Despite repeated attempts Vilathikulam MLA K Uma Maheshwari could not be reached over phone. 
 
 However, a spokesman said that works on more than 200 village roads and maintenance of drinking water tanks were pending in the assembly segment. 
 
 Efforts to make Ettayapuram a tourist place and establishing the SIPCOT were also pending.
