To   or not to when the   is played before a movie as mandated by the Supreme Court is an ongoing debate. But the issue was cause for a heated   on Saturday at the Bengaluru International Film Festival, when a section of the audience refused to stand for the national anthem before the screening of the Serbian film,  . The screening of the film was delayed by more than an hour and when it eventually got underway, a group of youngsters remained seated through the anthem, which incensed other members of the audience. 
A heated war of words ensued, with one of the youngsters adamant that it was his choice to remain seated. He was eventually escorted out of the movie hall by organizers and audience members who stood up for the cause of the anthem were heard congratulating each other. The show then went on.
