MUMBAI: State government-run   Hospital doctors on Thursday operated and removed a   from the right arm of an   pilgrim injured in the shoot-out in Jammu & Kashmir’s Anantnag district. Chhaya Meher (55), a resident of Dahanu, also had an arm fracture, which was fixed, said JJ   dean Dr T P Lahane.

 Two other Dahanu residents lost their lives in the attack, which claimed seven lives on Monday.
 
 “The patient was brought to JJ on Wednesday evening. She seemed stable and did not seem severely traumatised. But she did not speak much unless she was specifically asked a query,” said Dr Eknath Pawar, head of orthopedic department who operated on Meher. “She seems fine but bullet wounds take longer to heal. She may need to stay in hospital for two weeks or more,” he told TOI.
 
 “The patient is good right now. We are looking after her,” said Dr Lahane late on Thursday night.
 
 Meher, who is related to a woman killed in the attack, was airlifted from J&K on Tuesday. There was no clarity on when she would be brought home but she reached JJ Hospital late on Wednesday evening.
