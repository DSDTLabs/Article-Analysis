TIRUPUR: Unidentified textile dyeing units on Sunday were found to have discharged industrial effluent into  . 

 During evening hours, red-coloured effluent was flowing into the river under a road bridge on Perumanallur Road. Local residents claimed that the effluent could have flown for about two hours.
 
 As there are many dyeing units along the banks of Nallaru River at  , the   authorities suspect that a dyeing unit there could have released the effluent without following the Zero Liquid Discharge norm.
