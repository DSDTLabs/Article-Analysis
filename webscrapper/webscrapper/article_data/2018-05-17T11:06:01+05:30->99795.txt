 Addressing the audience,  , director of  , said, “For a city like Chandigarh, effective segregation of waste at the home and the establishment level is very important. Proper waste management is need of the hour. The solid waste needs to be segregated from the liquid waste in order to keep the production of methane at the land-fills and the treatment plants at the minimum. For a long time, centralised processes of waste management were being used but in a few cities some newly introduced de-centralised processes of waste processing like composting, community composting are getting popular. Parts of Gurgaon and Delhi are already trying these methods which are a great way to reduce the waste, than to process it even before it is discarded for being dumped in the landfills. Moreover, pertaining to the non-biodegradable nature of plastic, big restaurants, hotels and markets of wet-waste should be educated accordingly and they should tie-up with people for composting or pay for composting. Similarly, certain kinds of plastics such as ketchup sachets and straws should be completely banned.”
