Panaji: With the high tide range likely to surge to 2.37m at 11.40pm on Tuesday and 2.39m at 12.23am on Thursday morning, the revenue department has issued a weather advisory to coastal communities.  Hyderabad-based, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has issued a high wave alert to coastal states of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and Goa regarding the higher than normal tidal surge for five days till January 5. “The low-lying areas in the state of Goa, specially between Vasco, Mormugao and Panaji, should remain more alert,” a press release from revenue department stated. Goa, Kerala and West Bengal may face the effect of the above normal tidal surge while Tamil Nadu and Puducherry coasts are likely to be affected by the strong winds blowing at a speed of 45-55kmph. During the very severe cyclonic storm Ockhi and the simultaneous full moon in early December last year, the tidal surge damaged 50 shacks in North Goa and 34 in South Goa in what shack operators described as “worse than Tsunami”.
