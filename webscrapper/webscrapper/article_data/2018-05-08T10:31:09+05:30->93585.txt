CHANDIGARH:   may introduce ambulance-equipped two-wheeler service in the state on the pattern of Israel. This possibility has emerged after chief minister  , who is leading a high-level delegation to Israel, on Monday visited United Hatzalah in Jerusalem where he interacted with officials to know about the concept of community-based ambulance services provided through on two-wheelers. It has been launched in the crowded cities of Israel to meet emergencies. 

 With the CM evincing keen interest in the service which can help save time and lives, United Hatzalah of Israel has agreed to send a delegation to Haryana soon to explore the possibilities of a tie-up. Called ambucycles, these two-wheelers have an attached first-aid case designed to hold all necessary medical equipment. Unlike cars and ambulances, Ambucycles, due to their size, are not held up in traffic jams or in narrow streets. These are used by United Hatzalah's volunteers throughout Israel to make sure people get emergency treatment within the first few minutes of any mishap.
 
 The high-level delegation led by the CM includes minister of state for social justice Krishan Kumar Bedi. United Hatzalah of Israel is the largest independent, non-profit, voluntary emergency medical service organization which provides fastest and free emergency medical first response throughout Israel.
