NEW DELHI:  , who is under CBI investigation for an alleged bribery and corruption case, on Thursday left for London on what his father described as a scheduled trip.

 "Karti is travelling as per earlier travel plans. He will return after a few days. There is no ban on his travel," his father and senior   leader   said here.
 
 The CBI, on Tuesday, had carried out searches at Karti's homes and offices in four cities to probe charges that he had received money from a media firm owned by Indrani and   to help them evade a tax probe.
 
 Karti Chidambaram has denied all the charges made against him.
 
 The CBI had filed an FIR against Karti and the Mukerjeas on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, receiving illegal gratification, influencing public servants and criminal misconduct.
 
 It alleged that Karti received money from INX Media for using his influence to manipulate a tax probe against it in a case of violation of   conditions for an investment from Mauritius.
