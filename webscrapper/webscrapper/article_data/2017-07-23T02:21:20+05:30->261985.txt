GURUGRAM:   residents have raised serious concerns over a detailed project report ( ) prepared by a consultant for the proposed   of the township by  .

 In a letter to the MCG commissioner V Umashankar, the residents said that the consultant had underestimated the infrastructural requirement of the society with regard to water, electricity, sewage and road.
 
 The DPR states that 40% of the roads in the township need repairing.“Further, the report submitted by the consultant says only some of those broken roads need a fresh coat of single or double layer. However, all the roads in the society should be revamped fully,” claimed Abhay Poonia, an RWA member.
 
 The residents further pointed out that the existing water supply   was unable to cater to their needs. And to make the situation worse, the estimate projected by the consultant has not accounted for the consumption by schools and commercial complexes located on the society premises. Also, sewage lines are nonexistent at a lot of places while electricity lines have not been laid following the rules set by DHBVN. “The DPR does not take into account the load of group housing societies within the Suncity premises on the sewage pipelines and the storm water drainage,” pointed out Pramod Sharma, another RWA member.
 
 With regard to sewage treatment, the agency has stressed on the need for an STP with a capacity of 1.5 KLD, whereas the residents claim that the requirement is almost double. “The report says sewage produced in the area is 41 lakh litres, 75% of which goes through the sewage system. It means that around 31 lakh litres sewage has to be treated,” said Poonia.
 
 A senior MCG official said they were open to suggestions from the developer and the residents. “All their concerns will be taken into account before the takeover.”
