When the girl’s parents and other parents reached the school and tried to thrash the teacher, the principal informed the police. 
 
 “The incident took place in the first week of January and an FIR was registered on January 6. The teacher was arrested on the same day and sent to police custody for two days,” said senior inspector Ajay Landge. The teacher was later sent to magisterial custody remand.
