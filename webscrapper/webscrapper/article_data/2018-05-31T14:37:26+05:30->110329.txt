LUDHIANA: A 38-year-old woman was killed and 18 others injured after their mini bus driver fell asleep and rear-ended a truck on G T Road in Khanna around 12.15am on Wednesday.

 The family had hired the mini bus (DL1VC-1669) from Delhi to Vaishno Devi Shrine in Katra and left the Capital on Tuesday evening. 
 
 Police said near a mall on GT Road, the mini bus driver fell asleep and ran the vehicle into a truck (PB13AW-6089).

 Sadar Khanna police station head constable Jagdev Singh said, “One of the devotees died on the spot. An ambulance was called and the injured were taken to a nearby Khanna hospital. Some of them have been shifted to a private hospital in Ludhiana. The condition of most of them is stated to be stable.”
 
 Police have booked the mini bus driver under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 304 A (causing death due to negligence) of the Indian Penal Code. 
 
 A local said the stretch between Mandi Gobindgarh and Khanna had witnessed many fatal accidents as the road was not well lit at many places.
