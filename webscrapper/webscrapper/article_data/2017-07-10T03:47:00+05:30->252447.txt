Panaji: In view of the rising spate of road accidents across the state, a sizeable number of which involve youth, schools across the state will soon incorporate road safety as part of the syllabus. This move is aimed at sensitizing youngsters to the importance of responsible driving behaviour. “We are likely to incorporate road safety in this academic year’s curriculum, after the Diwlai vacations. If not, we will incorporate it in the next academic year,” director of education, Gajanan Bhat told TOI. Roads accidents claimed 25 more lives in 2016 as compared to 311 deaths in 2015, accounting for almost one road death for each day of the year. In the first three months of 2017, close to 80 people lost their lives on Goa’s roads. The decision to include road safety in the school curriculum was thus taken to create awareness among school children from a young age itself. “Teaching a child about traffic rules and responsible driving/riding at the school level will help us build responsible citizens in the society,” said deputy superintendent of police, North Goa traffic cell, Dharmesh Angle. Bhat said that the course will comprise theory as well as practical education. Students will be evaluated according to their performance in both. “A special text book will be put in place for the theoretical studies. For practicals, students, accompanied by the teachers, will be involved in road safety patrolling in the vicinity of their respective schools,” he said. The state council of education research and training, Porvorim, has requested the state transport department and traffic cell to make relevant material available to them for the said purpose.  Considering the increase in accidents in the state, the chief minister Manohar Parrikar in May had suggested that traffic education should be taught in schools.
