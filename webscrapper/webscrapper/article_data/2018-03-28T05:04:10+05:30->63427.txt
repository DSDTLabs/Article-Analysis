NEW DELHI: As a "Fumble harmer" whom circumstances propelled to prime ministership and turned into an overnight phenomenon, the coming   elections would be HD Deve  's last stand in the electoral arena. 

 As his party JD(S) shrank with time, losing its pre-eminence of early 90s, Gowda perfected the art of using his position as "kingmaker" to prop up governments and even rule the state. His son HD Kumaraswamy managed to become the CM with the help of  .
 
  Fittingly, Gowda's perceived final Act in politics is poised for a similar finale. By calculations in   and BJP both, JD(S) may win between 25-30 seats and emerge as the indispensable player in government formation. For a marginal player, a hung assembly would be the best outcome of the battle that would be a face-off between Congress and BJP. 
 
 Gowda can join hands with Congress and BJP both, depending on what suits his party best.
 
  The future promises to be exciting. Holding the Congress flag is chief minister  , the man who spent decades by Gowda's side only to rebel against his "dynastic designs". He joined Congress and managed to become the CM. 
 
 By all accounts, Gowda's first condition would be to avenge the humiliation at the hands of Siddaramaiah.
 
 Congress has unleashed a shrill attack on JD(S), calling it the "B team" of RSS.
 
 Directly fighting JD(S) in one region, the Vokkaliga belt, Congress would want to minimize Gowda's tally to reduce his bargaining power in a hung assembly.
 
  Similarly, JD(S) would prefer a weak Congress to extract a better deal in a power-sharing agreement in case a coalition if required. 
 
  With that objective in mind, Congress suspects JD(S) would field "suitable" candidates in constituencies where BJP and Congress would be locked in a direct fight, with the idea that it would hurt the prospects of Congress. "He benefits either way, provided it is a hung assembly. A close election is what he must be praying for," a Congress leader said.
