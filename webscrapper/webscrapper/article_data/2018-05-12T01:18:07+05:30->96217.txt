NEW DELHI: Delhi Police has registered a case against unidentified people for pasting   having images of Prime Minister   with the tagline “The Lie Lama”. The posters were found pasted on a wall at J block in Lutyens’ Delhi’s Mandir Marg area.

 A case for defacement of property was registered at the Mandir Marg police on the complaint of the BJP after senior leaders of the party had raised an objection to the posters. It was found that the miscreants had pasted the posters in some areas of Model Town and   as well, which were also removed.
 
 The posters showed the Prime Minister’s face with “The Lie Lama” written in red over them. BJP leaders said that the posters were not only in bad taste for the Prime Minister but were also mocking the religious leader, Dalai Lama.
 
 Police officers said that three posters pasted in Mandir Marg were seized after the complaint and sent for analysis. The posters do not name any person or organisation.
 
 Cops suspect the hand of some groups involved in vandalising bus stops and other areas. CCTV cameras in the area are being scanned to identify them.
 
 The matter was reported after a senior leader who was campaigning for the BJP in Karnataka returned to the city and noticed some of the posters. Following this, the state BJP unit was asked to approach the cops and register a complaint.
