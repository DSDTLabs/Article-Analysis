 MUMBAI: In the coming years, you may not need to dive into the Arabian Sea off the   coast to catch a glimpse of the glorious coral reefs there. Giving a big boost to tourism in the Konkan belt, the state budget has allocated Rs 49 crore to acquire a battery-operated submarine, which will let tourists enjoy the marine life while sitting in closed cabins.

 Minister of state for finance   said, “One of the major projects to promote tourism will be a battery-operated submarine in Sindhudurg. Tourists can go deep into the sea and view the coral biodiversity in the submarine. A detailed project report will be prepared by December 2018.”
 
 The state government has also kept aside Rs 10 crore to restore Sindhudurg Fort, Rs 20 crore for Ganpatipule beautification and Rs 22 crore for conservation of laterite stone paintings across Konkan. The around 400-year-old paintings will undergo massive conservation programme.
 
 The Konkan economy is dependent on tourism and farming, and the state government has set aside Rs 100 crore for cashew and mango farming. Taking cue from   and Goa, the state will also promote coir industry in Konkan and Rs 10 crore budgetary support has been provided for the same.
