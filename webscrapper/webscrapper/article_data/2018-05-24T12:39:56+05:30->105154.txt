NAGPUR: State BJP president   said his party was of the firm view that all like-minded parties should be together while facing the next elections in the state. However, such binding needs reciprocal action, he said.

 Danve was in the city on Wednesday and spoke informally to reporters before leaving for   to join the poll campaign.
 
 Asked about his response to   executive president Uddhav Thackeray’s threats of severing ties with the BJP for all times to come, Danve said, “So, you expect BJP to run after Shiv Sena?”
 
 The state BJP president accused Sena of already breaching the “alliance dharma” by fielding its candidate against the BJP in Lok Sabha by-election for Palghar seat, which along with Bhandara -Gondia, goes to polls on May 28. “As in sports, any breach invites disqualification, same is in politics by way of rejection,” he said, implying that people would not approve of the Sena poaching on BJP and giving ticket to deceased party MP Chintamani Wanga’s son.
 
 Responding to Sena leader Diwakar Raote’s comment that the BJP will have to pay the price for importing leaders from other parties, Danve said after the Wanga incident in Palghar, the Sena had no moral authority to comment on engineering defections.
 
 About the rising costs of petrol and diesel and the burden of it on common man, Danve admitted that it was a grave issue but said the central government will address the problem soon, probably by slashing taxes on fuels.
