NEW DELHI: A day after minister of human resource development,  , came out strongly against attempts to rename Dyal Singh (Evening) College, the governing body (GB) chairperson claimed that they have followed all rules to change the name to  .

 Amitabh Sinha said that while DU is yet to approve the name change, the college has done so in its own capacity. Sinha also alleged that Javadekar’s statement was “arm-twisted, provoked and mislead by the SAD MP Harsimrat Kaur Badal”.
 
 The controversy over the name change came back into the limelight recently, when the erstwhile evening college, in their annual prize distribution function on April 25, put up a banner with the name ‘Vande Mataram Dyal Singh college’. Several teachers and politicians claimed this was an insult to the philanthropist Dyal Singh Majithia, after whom the college was named.
 
 “The name changed at the college programme was illegal. They have yet to get an approval from the university,” a teacher of the college said.
 
 However, Sinha said the name of   will remain as it is. It is only the evening college’s name that has changed. The name change at the programme was also a student initiative, a fact that was confirmed by Rajan Payla, secretary of DSC evening.
 
 Sinha also attacked Delhi SAD MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa for “playing Sikh politics”, saying only a prefix of Vande Mataram has been added to the erstwhile evening college’s name.
 
 Hitting back, Sirsa said the issue of renaming has been taken at the highest level by Union cabinet minister   with the Prime Minister and the MHRD. “Sinha is trying grab media attention with his falseclaims, as the power of naming or renaming lies with executive council of   and thereafter with the approval of vice-chancellor and chancellor.”
