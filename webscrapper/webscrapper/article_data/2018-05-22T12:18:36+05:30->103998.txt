  The warning was issued by senior superintendent of police ( )   on Monday in view of wide-spread use of social media networks in spreading fake news, inflammatory messages and gory pictures with the intent to disturb law and order situation, mainly to fuel communal tension as had been seen in the region in the recent past.
  
  A message on a WhatsApp group — ‘Bareilly Police Forum’ — administered by the public relation officer of the SSP and which members are journalist from across the media — reading as an ‘important information’ was flashed by the group admin with a warning: “Your post on FB and WhatsApp may land you in jail.”
  
  In that post, SSP warned: “If anyone posts or forwards any catastrophic and inflammatory article, photo or video on WhatsApp or on  , an FIR would be lodged against that person under sections 505 (statements conducing public mischief), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on ground of religion, race, place of birth, residence and language), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 298 (uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Not just that, action could also be taken against the offender under NSA.”
  
  The district police head also advised people to be cautious before sharing any post on social media platforms as that may contain disturbing content from other districts, states or even countries. “Ignore such posts. Besides, it is the responsibility of the group admin to remove such members who circulate disturbing contents from the group and immediately inform police,” he said.
  
  Notably, the SSP also directed SPs (city, rural and crime) and circle officer (crime) to keep a tab on social media contents.
