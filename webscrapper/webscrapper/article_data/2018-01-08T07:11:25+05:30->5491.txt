HYDERABAD:   sleuths recorded the statements of around 100 farmers and 50 organisers who revealed that they didn't lease their land to seed companies,   seeds and  . 

 The raids, which begun on Thursday in four states on offices and residences of directors of Nuziveedu Seeds of NSL group headquartered in Banjara Hills and   Seeds in SD Road in Secunderabad, concluded on Saturday evening. Some of the farmers told I-T sleuths that they had suffered losses too.
 
 Sources said the two major seed companies claimed exemption for an income of around 800 crore in the past five years, of which 30% tax was supposed to be paid. They kept stating that it was agricultural revenue, when actually they had brought seeds from farmers, which was business activity. The department is looking at huge documents and statements recorded to prove that it was business activity. 
 
 Statements of farmers and organisers were recorded in Gadwal and Mahabubnagar in Telangana, Eluru, Nandyal and Kurnool in AP, Ahmedabad and   in  , and Davanagare and Bellary in Karnataka.
 
 Seed companies claimed that they took 40,000 acres each and supplied foundation seeds and gave technical inputs to farmers and "reimbursed" expenses of farmers.
 
 An I-T source said, "Some of the farmers said they had suffered losses, as sometimes their seeds were of bad quality and rejected by the companies. As a result, they had to sell them outside to other buyers at a nominal price. If the land was leased out, why would the farmers suffer loses or their seeds be rejected? Farmers were paid an advance and the same was collected back with interest. Even the organisers confessed that they brought the seeds from farmers by paying money."
