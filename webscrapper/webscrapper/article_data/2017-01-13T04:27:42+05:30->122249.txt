CHENNAI: Three men hacked an   to death at Thiruneermalai near   on Thursday. 

 Police said A Abusali, 34, a scrap iron dealer, was sitting in his shop at Nagalkeni when the men, who came of two bikes, attacked him with lethal weapons. The gang made sure Abusali died on the spot before fleeing.
 
 The Chromepet police, who rushed to the spot, moved the body to Chromepet Government Hospital for postmortem. Traders in the area staged a protest alleging threat to their lives. 
 
 Tension prevailed for some time as they raised slogans against police and blamed them for not providing adequate security.
 
 Police, who have formed a special team to track the assailants, said Abusali was considered a popular party worker. They suspect that Palayamkottai Rafiq, a notorious kidnapper now lodged in Puzhal prison, is behind the killing. 
 
 Police said last December, Mohamed Ali, a scrap iron dealer and Abusali's uncle, was kidnapped by Rafiq from Pallavaram. Mohamed was released after his family paid Rs 10 lakh as ransom. Later, Abusali approached police and got Rafiq arrested. 
 
 Police said Rafiq, who has a string of cases against him, might have got Abusali bumped off as an act of revenge.
