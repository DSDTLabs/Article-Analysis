According to the reports in the BoxofficeIndia.com, the   directorial collected Rs 1.25 crore on Saturday.

 The film is a quirky horror-comedy where a ghost falls in love with a crook. The unconventional love story is packaged with impactful writings and impressive performances.
 
 Speaking of being part of mainstream cinema like ‘Nanu Ki Jaanu’, Abhay Deol had reportedly said that he always tries to do middle-of-the-road cinema. The film is like that too. He added that he never wanted to be all out artistic to the level where it isolates people and that he has done the non-mainstream movies too like ‘Manorama Six Feet Under’, ‘Road the Movie’ and ‘Shanghai’. But largely all his effort has always been to do middle-of-the-road films.
 
 The comedy film is reportedly based on the 2014 Tamil hit ‘Pisaasu’. When asked if Patralekha watched the original as part of her legwork for her role, she reportedly said that her film ‘City Lights’ was a remake of an English film, but she didn’t watch that and she didn’t watch ‘Pisaasu’ either. The actress feels that her character and her film should be her own interpretation.
