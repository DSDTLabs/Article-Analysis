DHARAMSHALA: Prime Minister  's visit to Israel, the first by an Indian PM, has ushered in a new era of hope for the residents of   in the Kangra district, also known as Mini-Israel. There are high expectations that his visit will boost tourism in the area. 

 For Israelis, Dharamkot is home away from home as many Israeli visitors have simply loved the place. Located at the height of around 2, 200 meter, this village also boasts a Jewish center - a Chabad house. The place was also famous for celebrating the Isreali New Year - Rosh-Hashana. 
 
 Deepak Deewan one of the oldest travel agents of the area told it was the visa restrictions earlier which had affected tourism. "Israeli tourists use to get a visa for six months which could be renewed in a gap of a week or days. But later the rules were changed as the norms tightened," he said. This has reduced the number of tourists to this village. "The inflow of tourists was hampered," said  , a restaurant owner in Dharamkot.
 
 Manjeet Singh, a trekker from the village told that they learnt that visa norms were relaxed few months ago, but still it isn't reflected in the number of tourists as it was earlier. "I am pretty sure that Modi's visit is going to have an impact," he said.
 
 Israelis have explored this village in ''90s and were regular visitors here that was a culture shock to this village originally belonging to the 'Gaddi' tribe of the state. Shops here have sign boards written in Hebrew, clocks hanging on the walls display the time of Tel Aviv, Israel's capital. This small village also has pay phone booths with the keyboards in the internet cafes written in Hebrew. 
 
 Restaurant owners use slangs in Israeli language which they have picked up from customers. 
 
 Villagers emulate hair styles from Israelis.
