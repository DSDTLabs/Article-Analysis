Fed up of submitting memorandums to the   demanding action against the   in the city,   under the   (NECF) have put up banners with the Deputy Commissioner’s photo near open drains around Mangaluru where  .

 The banners in Kannada, addressed to Deputy Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada K G Jagadeesh read thus: “If you are truly the Deputy Commissioner of this region, please set right this d; otherwise you can leave the city. Even though there is a government order, why are you not doing anything about it?” They have shared the deputy Commissioner’s number on the banner. Speaking to Bangalore Mirror, Shashidhar Shetty, convener of NECF, said, “We put up the banners on Saturday in about 10 places where open drains exist and we noticed that one near Pumpwell has already been taken off. 
 
 We are fed up of submitting memorandums. No action is being taken. All our requests are falling on deaf ears. All the waste from the open drains joins the river or sea. Lot of money is available through the KUDCEMP Project and it is important to set right the drainage problem of the city,” he said.
 
 Shetty said, “Swachh Bharat is not about cleaning roads only and sharing a picture. While cleaning roads is important, it is more important to get the drains cleaned as they act as a breeding ground for mosquitoes and spread diseases.
 
 There is a mafia that operates behind this too. Some of the buildings do not have drainage connection and the manholes at a few places are connected to these open drains.
 
 “The Mangaluru City Corporation is not willing to take action against them. This is polluting the river water. The quality of water is dropping. Allowing this situation to prevail forces us to think if we are actually a smart city or a clean city,” said Shetty.
