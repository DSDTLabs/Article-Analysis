Nagpur: In August last year, over 25 cases of jaundice were reported from Nagpur Municipal Corporation’s (NMC) Dhantoli zone comprising Bhagwan Nagar, Bank Colony and Naik Nagar. On Tuesday night, residents of   and Bhagwan Nagar recounted the health scare after receiving odorous and pale drinking   in their taps.

 According to corporator Manoj Gawande, several residents were forced to buy drinking water cans on Wednesday. “The problem is at the treatment plant. All houses in the area supplied by Omkar Nagar tank have received contaminated water, which can cause serious health issues,” he said.
 
 Mukund Malwe, a resident of Bhagwan Nagar, said, “We’ve been forced to buy water cans. We are a family of 10 and buying cans is expensive. We have been facing the issue since Tuesday, and hope the matter is resolved at the earliest.” 
 
 Atul Bhange, resident of Rameshwari, said that while the water looked pale yellow on Tuesday night, it was fine on Wednesday. “However, there was a persistent odour. I have six members in my family and there are nearly 15 families in our society, all of whom have been forced to buy drinking water. We have collectively complained to the corporator and have been assured some action in this regard,” he said. 
 
 Raju Shrivastav, who lives in Vasant Nagar, said his area also received polluted water on Wednesday morning. “While we were lucky to have stored water, we were forced to use water of boring well for some time, until we were finally able to buy water cans,” he said.
 
 Secretary of Congress city committee Manish Chandekar said that if the matter remains unsolved, they would approach the mayor for a solution.
 
 NMC executive engineer Sanjay Gaikwad said he was unaware about the issue as he had not received any complaint. He said that officials will look into the matter. OCW officer in charge Raju Pawar said that the water supply is done at 7pm everyday and he would personally inspect the area on Thursday evening.
