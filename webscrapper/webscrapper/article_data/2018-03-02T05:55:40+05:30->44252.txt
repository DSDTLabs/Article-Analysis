ANANDPUR SAHIB: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and SAD (A) held political conferences on the occasion of   here on Thursday while the ruling   and opposition AAP decided against organizing conventions. 

 Speaking on the occasion, SAD president Sukhbir Badal ridiculed Punjab finance minister   for referring to Rs 2,000 crore spent by former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal to preserve the heritage in the state as wasteful expenditure.
 
 He said history had proven that only those communities who preserved their culture and heritage progressed. He claimed that the former CM had established the Virasat-e-Khalsa, Chhota and Vadda Ghallughara monuments besides establishing the Baba Banda Singh Bahadur memorial and the heritage street in Amritsar. 
 
 "Today, our schoolchildren visit these memorials to learn about their rich glorious past. Thousands of Punjabis visit the Virasat-e-Khalsa from across the world to reconnect with their roots. Saying that money had been wasted to create these world-class memorials is indeed shameful," he maintained.
 
 Sukhbir alleged that the incumbent government did not respect its own culture and heritage. "  did not visit Darbar Sahib after taking over as chief minister," he said.
 
 The former deputy CM said they ensured free power facility for farmers but the Congress government was set to impose power bills on farmers soon. Sukhbir said, "Welfare benefits, including old-age pension, shagun and scholarship schemes for SC students are no more there, besides around 800 schools have been closed and the annual World Kabaddi Cup was also not hosted." He said SAD had decided to wake up the government from its slumber by gheraoing the Punjab Vidhan Sabha on the first day of the forthcoming budget session. Union minister and Punjab BJP president Vijay Sampla, Anandpur Sahib MP Prem Singh Chandumajra and others were also present.
