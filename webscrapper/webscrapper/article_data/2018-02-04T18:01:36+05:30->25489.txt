Veteran actor   revealed that she was sexually abused and raped by   producer  .

  
  
 The actress was a part of the movie   which was produced by Weinstein.
 
 Post the release of the movie, she met Weinstein for the first time along with his former wife.
 
 In an interview, she said, "He used to spend hours talking to me about the material and complimenting my mind and validating me. It possibly made me overlook warning signs. This was my champion. I was never any kind of studio darling. He had a chokehold on the type of films and directors that were right for me."
 
 According to a New york daily, the first incident happened at his suite in a hotel in London where the producer tried to force himself on Thurman and molested her.
 
 The actress severed all ties with him immediately after the incident and, on the other hand, Weinstein stopped doing any projects with her.
 
 Later, she received a bouquet of yellow roses from the producer along with a note said, "You have great instincts."
 
 In return, she offered to meet Weinstein in a hotel room to clear the matter. That was the time when she was assaulted. The producer apparently pressurised the actor to not reveal about the incident as he threatened her with leaking their pictures, she revealed during the interview.
 
 The production of the movie   again brought Thurman and Weinstein together.
 
 Thurman confided in their director   about the incident at Paris hotel, who further confronted Harvey and that ended their abusive work relationship.
