 Earlier, VACB director   himself had come under severe criticism from the vigilance special court, citing laxity in probing the cases against ministers. The court, while considering the petition against Mercykutty Amma, had expressed its displeasure in the agency's lukewarm attitude in launching the probe over the complaint. The court had remarked that the agency decided to take up the case only after the complaint reached the court thrice.
