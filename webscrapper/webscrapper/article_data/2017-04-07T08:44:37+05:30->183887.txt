MUMBAI: In a stunning development, the   dropped veteran off-spinner   from their IPL-10 opener against Rising Pune Supergiant at Pune on Thursday night.

 The debatable decision, which seems to be a combined call taken by skipper Rohit Sharma and new coach  , may have come back to bite MI as they sorely missed the experience of the tweaker while failing to defend 184 on a flat MCA Stadium pitch. "It was a tactical decision. Looking at the pitch in Pune, MI decided to go with four pacers and a left-arm spinner ( ) for this game," said a source. "It was a call which surprised 'Bhajji', more than it hurt him," said another source. It's learnt that the slow bowler had travelled with the team to Pune, and was told that he wasn't playing on Wednesday. 
 
 This is the first time that Harbhajan has been dropped in his 125-match career for MI, in which he's picked 119 wickets, at average of 26.21, and an economy rate of 7.00, which is wonderful by T20 standards. The feisty bowler has been with the Mumbai team since the inaugural edition in 2008, and even led the team to the Champions League T20 title in 2011, and was the MI captain in the 2012 edition too. A successful   in 2015 (18 wickets in 15 games@24.77, econ rate: 24.77) helped him return to the Indian team, but in the last edition of the glitzy T20 tournament, all the offie could manage was nine wickets in 14 games@43.55, with an economy rate of 8.00, and that seems to have influenced his omission on Thursday. 
 
 The axe is the latest blow in Harbhajan's long, illustrious but currently dwindling career, which seems set to halt to a close now. The 36-year-old, who wasn't even included in the list of 32 centrally-contracted-contracted players announced by the BCCI recently, played the last of his 103 Tests for India in August 2015 against Sri Lanka in the first Test of that series in Galle- a game in which he picked up just one wicket as India lost by 63 runs. In his last ODI for India, he conceded 70 runs in 10 overs as South Africa plundered a record 438 for four in 50 overs on a batting beauty at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on October 25, 2015. His last T20 international was against UAE in the Asia Cup in March last year, when he took 1-11 off his four overs.
 
 Choosing to spend time with his new-born daughter, Hinaya Heer Plaha, Harbhajan didn't play in the Ranji Trophy this season, though he did lead Punjab in the limited overs tournaments later.
 
 It remains to be seen if the 'Turbanator' will be recalled by MI for their second game against the Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday night at the Wankhede Stadium, where's generally been difficult to score off. It would be interesting to see if the spinner, who has 417 Test wickets under his belt, is able to bounce back from this setback, or throws in the towel.
