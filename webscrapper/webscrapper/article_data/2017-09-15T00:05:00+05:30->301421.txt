The biggest indicator of an expanding urbanscape is probably the number of apartment complexes that sprout in the city and on its fringes. From local residents, settlers to passers-by, these housing blocks are inhabited by people from different places of origin, following varied professions and of a range of age groups. However, although they live in the same building, there are instances when people have probably never spoken to each other or not even bothered to find out who stays next door. But, again there are opposite cases too.

  Jagriti Theatre’s latest play, 
 , is about people in an apartment block. “You know them well — they will make you laugh, squirm, retch and want to run away, but you can’t. Because, when you reach home they will be there — in the garden, lift and kids’ playground.”
 
  “The play is a colloquial insight on the shenanigans of apartment living. It is right up your street and you cannot miss it. Despite the diversity, when you stay in an apartment block, the everyday problems are quite identical — be it security issues or garbage management. The housing complexes have created their own cultures, but there is a certain kind of detachment too,” says director  .
 
  The cast of the play includes Anirudh Acharya, Arundhati Raja, David Selvaraj, Hemanth Narayan, Jaya Kalyanaraman, Karn Malhotra, K Kalyanaraman, Paramita Gupta, Roomi Daroowala, Sagaram Dhananjai, Shlok Menon, Urvashi Goverdhan and Vijay Sharma.
 
  
 
 
  Societal Woes is about you and me, and how we tend to live with our neighbours. We love and hate the people we interact with just as they love and hate us.
