CHANDIGARH: The   on Wednesday stayed the arrest of Hisar central jail superintendent Shamsher Singh Dahiya in a case filed against him by an inmate accusing him of torture and extortion. Four other constables who are posted at the jail and were accused in the case along with Dahiya, have also been granted bail.

 Justice H S Sidhu of the HC passed the orders after hearing an anticipatory bail plea of   and four others. The court has also issued notice to the complainant, seeking his reply by February 2 on the contentions raised by Dahiya against his summoning in the case.
 
 “The petitioners shall appear before the summoning court on January 7, 2016, which shall admit them to interim anticipatory bail, on their furnishing bail bonds/surety bonds to its satisfaction,” ordered the court.
 
 One Rajbir Singh, an inmate of Hisar jail had filed a complaint before the judicial magistrate Hisar accusing Dahiya and others for accusing and demanding money. Allegations under   ( ) Act were also levelled against them. Acting on the complaint, the judicial magistrate Hisar had summoned Dahiya and other accused. Their appeal against the orders of magistrate was also dismissed by the sessions court, Hisar.
 
 In his petition, Dahiya submitted that the complainant had registered a false complaint against him just to settle a score because he had caught him using mobile phone inside the jail and registered an FIR and ordered confinement in the ward. 
 
 The petitioners argued that in view of sections 4 and 5 of the Prevention of corruption act and Section 14 of the SC & ST Act (as amended by the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015), a magistrate has no power to take cognizance of the offence under these Acts and, as such, the impugned order is wholly without jurisdiction.
