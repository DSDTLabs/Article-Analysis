AHMEDABAD: Students of Hemchandracharya Sanskrit Pathshala raised the curtain for the Saptak-2017 finale, on Friday. Their renditions were like an ecstatic prayer in the temple of music where over the past 13 days, 150 classical musicians had performed.

  brought alive the Parampara (tradition) of classical dance accompanied by her son, Revanta. They transported rasikas to the world of divine bliss with their representation of the dance contest between Lord Shiva and Ma Parvati, in Raga Kamboj. Satish Vyas is not only the senior most disciple of Pandit Shiv Kumar Sharma, but also does justice to his musician father, C S Vyas. He offered a rare raga, Kaushik Dhwani. It was like the dance of Lord Shiva and Ma Parvati again, bathing in the ballet of snowflakes.
 
  The living divinities of Indian classical music, Pandits Rajan and  , enchanted rasikas with their vocal symphony. They brought with them 300 years of Banaras inheritance in sterling quintessence. They rendered   in its kosher structure, meandering through rich impromptu leitmotifs of intricate laykaari.
