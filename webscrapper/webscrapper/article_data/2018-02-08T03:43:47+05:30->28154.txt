NOIDA: ‘Noida Express’,   who received a boisterous welcome at DND Flyway on Wednesday was handed over a cheque of just Rs 51,000 for his outstanding performance by the district administration. But according to Phool Chand Sharma, Mavi’s coach of 11 years, the administration had ignored the fast bowler’s achievements before the Under-19 World Cup.

 Speaking to TOI, Sharma rued that even after the win, no one from the administration congratulated the player or the coach who received the first call of congratulations on Tuesday when he was informed that they will be offering the cheque to Shivam. “In June 2017, a list of 171 emerging sportsmen from the district to be honoured was issued by the district sports officer but it did not have Shivam’s name,” he added.
 
 The district sports officer, however, said that she never received documents from the coach.
 
 “We did not get any help or recognition from the district administration earlier and now, we received a call from the DM’s office only when the matter came to limelight. Two players have played international level matches for India but no one from the DM office or the district sports officer’s office ever recognised their contributions,” he said. 
 
 However, the district sports officer told TOI that she did not receive documents of the Shivam and Harsh from the coach so that they could be considered for the prize.
 
 “I only received a phone call from the coach about the teenagers playing for England. I had asked him to come and meet me in my office and hand over their documents to me along with an application. But the same was not done. I get applications from so many candidates who apply. I had asked them to apply even till the last date so that their name can be added but the same was not done,” she said.
