This magical look was created by New York-based stylist Nikki Lee, who demonstrated how to create a   glitter fishtail braid.
You can get going on this look with some   glitter gel. If need be, you can also use craft glitter, but we cannot guarantee how the look will turn out.
 Whether you use the   to cover all your hair, or just one strand, let your imagination run wild. “It is an innovative   for young and creative party animals, who can now add a new dimension to their look. Apart from nightclubs and quirky music festivals, the look can be sported at high-fashion events. Go for a bold makeup with this look,” says makeup and hair stylist Zara Syed.
 So, go bold and turn heads with this look.
