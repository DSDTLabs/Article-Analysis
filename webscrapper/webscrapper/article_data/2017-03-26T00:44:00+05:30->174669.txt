Mangaluru: A woman’s complaint to a minister over phone has led to the cancellation of the licence of a   run by a cooperative society in Shaktinagar on Friday. 

 Minister for food, civil supplies U T Khader on March 23 received a phone call from a BPL card holder in Shaktinagar. The woman complained to Khader that the shop run by Naguri Vyavasaya Sahakari Sangha did not issue rice to her under ‘Anna Bhagya’ for the month. 
 
 The shop had allegedly denied rice for the month on March 23 despite a government order that makes it mandatory for shops to continue distribution of foodgrains till the end of the particular month. The person at the fair price shop reportedly asked the woman to visit the shop again in April citing no stock of rice. 
 
 On reaching home, the woman called the minister and explained her grievance. The woman told the minister that the shopkeeper did not listen to her when she questioned about the violation of the government order that mandates continuous distribution of food grains all through the month. She also made mention about similar experiences she had in the past. 
 
 Responding to the woman’s complaint, Khader directed department deputy director A T Jayappa to conduct an inquiry. Following this, Jayappa conducted a spot visit, checked records and collected details. The officer found that the fair price shop had violated the rules by not distributing rice under Anna Bhagya to other BPL card holders as well. 
 
 “The deputy director submitted a report to the deputy commissioner mentioning the lapse on the part of the fair price shop. Following this, the DC has directed the department to cancel the licence of the shop with immediate effect,” stated a release from the department of information and public relations.
