PATNA:   jawan   (25) was shot at during an attempt to rob him on the   bridge under the Gandhi Maidan police station area in Patna at around 3.15am on Sunday.

 Police said six criminals on three bikes intercepted Rai and shot at in the back of his left shoulder when he resisted their attempt to rob him. Rai belongs to Sasaram and had come to Patna after attending a marriage ceremony at Bikram in the district, his family sources said. 
 
 DIG (central range) Rajesh Kumar said Rai had a scuffle with the criminals who tried to loot his bike and valuables. He said the incident was the result of poor police patrolling. “The victim is unconscious and undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Raja Bazaar area. No empty cartridge was recovered from the spot,” he said.
 
 Soon after the incident, the DIG suspended   for dereliction of duty and attached him to the police lines. He also suspended the police patrolling party comprising ASI Priyaranjan Singh and three home guard jawans on duty near the bridge at that time.
 
 This was the third major crime in the state capital within 24 hours after trader Ram Bacchan Rai (45) was shot dead at Digha and a couple was killed inside their residence near Bihta on Saturday.
 
 The DIG said a 17-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the Digha trader’s murder.
 
 City SP (Central) D Amarkesh said Sunny Rai (25), Vikash Rai (22), Lallu Rai (40) and the arrested juvenile were named as accused in an FIR lodged by the deceased’s younger brother Tarkeshwar Kumar. He said the murder was a fallout of old enmity and raids were on to nab the other accused in the case.
 
 The DIG also attached Digha police station SHO Rajesh Kumar Dubey to the police lines as he has been ill for the last one month while other officers were available to replace him.
 
 Police were yet to achieve any breakthrough in the Bihta couple’s murder case. The DIG spared Bihta police station SHO Ranjeet Kumar Singh with a warning after the double murder.
