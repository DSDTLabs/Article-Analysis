GURGAON: Over 100 cyber-crime cases were filed in the city this past week.

 TOI reported on January 1 that at least 67 cyber-crime cases were filed on December 29 December 30, as cops registered all such complaints, received in the past one year, at one go. Sources told TOI the city’s cyber cell, with a team of 7-8 and without any special equipment, receives 20-30 cases a day on average. Cyber crime   are filed only after the cell carries out preliminary probe and recommends worthy cases.
 
 For this probe, the cyber cell needs to involve banks, social media or concerned groups, which further delays the process. In several of last year’s cases, plaintiffs said they received calls from impostors, posing as bank representatives who knew their names and banks where they had accounts, to ask for account or credit card details. In such cases, cops have to ask the banks for transaction statements.
 
 Similarly, in cases involving impersonators on social media, the cell has to contact the concerned website with a DCP (crime) approved notice (Section 91, CrPC Act), as not everyone can avail such sensitive details. Thereafter, the internet service provider is contacted to trace the accused’s IP address. A similar procedure is followed in case of hoax calls. The complex verification process, coupled with manpower shortage and absence of specialised equipment, leads to long delays in registering complaints, giving offenders an edge.
 
 Sources said Gurgaon police, however, is registering cyber-crime more pro-actively in the past week.
