KOCHI: Opposition leader   demanded inquiry into the alleged involvement of chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the appointment of relatives of former minister E P Jayarajan.

 Speaking while inaugurating UDF district meet here on Saturday, Chennithala said he would write to the vigilance in this regard.
 
 “The vigilance and anti-corruption bureau has become a puppet at the hands of the LDF government. It is observed that the agency takes up cases only a day prior to when the case comes up in courts,” Chennithala said. 
 
 In a veiled attack on power minister M M Mani, the opposition leader questioned him continuing in office even after court rejected the latter’s discharge petition in a murder case and sought explanation from CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechuri.
 
 Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said the Congress would not allow the government sabotage the public distribution system in the name of the new food safety act. tnn
