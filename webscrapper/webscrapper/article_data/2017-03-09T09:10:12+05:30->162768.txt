CHENNAI:   rebel leader   on Wednesday said health minister   would be the first one to be arrested in connection to former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's death. "For 75 days none of us were allowed to meet Jayalalithaa. On the corridors of  , state health minister C Vijayabaskar had posted some people to monitor visitors to the hospital. Once an enquiry is ordered I am ready to be the first person to be questioned, but Vijayabaskar will be the first to be arrested," said Panneerselvam. 

 In the morning, Panneerselvam arrived at the venue at 9am to cheers and sloganeering from cadres, hailing him as the future chief minister. The venue wore a festive look with cadres from various city assembly segments trickling in and shaking hands with Panneerselvam. A speech delivered by Jayalalithaa in 2009 praising him was played repeatedly, enthusing supporters. 
 
 In the speech delivered during a family function of Panneerselvam at Periyakulam in 2009, Jayalalithaa had recalled OPS's rise from an ordinary cadre to the level of a minister and later chief minister. She wanted the youth and others who joined the party to be patient and work sincerely for the party. Once the crowd swelled and all available chairs were occupied, former AIADMK legislator JCD Prabhakar said, "Wait for an important announcement and please don't shout." 
 
 Soon the entire speech was relayed and OPS supporters went into a frenzy. "I have yet to find a person who has returned kingship just like Panneerselvam did. (Panneerselvam resigned from the chief minister's post in 2002 after the   acquitted her in the Tansi case and again in 2015 after her acquittal in the disproportionate assets case by the Karnataka high court). But I could find such a person only in the Ramayana where Bharata gave back the kingship to Lord Rama when the latter returned to Ayodhya from the forest," said Jayalalithaa.
