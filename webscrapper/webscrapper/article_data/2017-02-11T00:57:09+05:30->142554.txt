 Coimbatore: An AIADMK functionary on Friday petitioned the deputy commissioner of police (DCP, law & order) S Lakshmi, demanding that the police find out the eight MLAs of Coimbatore district who are “missing” now. Accepting the plea, the city police issued a receipt of community service register (CSR) to the petitioner. 
 
 In his petition, Srinivasan SMV, an AIADMK deputy ward secretary (52nd ward) claimed that the party MLAs were elected by the people of Coimbatore district, “so they cannot remain untraceable”. Their whereabouts are not known for the past one week, he said, and demanded the police trace them soon. “Kavundampalayam constituency MLA VC Arukutty has taken the right decision by backing the people’s decision to support O Panneerselvam. The people in the constituency can easily approach him over phone now, but the whereabouts of rest of the eight MLAs are unknown. They failed to do their work for people,” Srinivasan said.
 
 He also said that the people voted for former chief minister J Jayalalithaa not the MLAs. “The elected MLAs should understand that the people selected them to work for their constituencies. But, they are not reachable for the past one week. The party won’t get any votes from the public if they don’t come out,” Srinivasan said.
 
 Srinivasan, a native of Thanjavur district, supplyies organic fertilizers to farmers in Coimbatore. He is an AIADMK party member for the past 20 years. “I stopped going to tea shops or restaurants because people everywhere are asking me about the MLAs,” he said.
 
 After receiving the complaint, the DCP forwarded the petition to the Race Course police inspector V Selvaraj for further action. The inspector, after inquiring with Srinivasan, issued a CSR receipt on Friday evening.
