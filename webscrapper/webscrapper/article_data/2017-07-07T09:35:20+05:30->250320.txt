GANDHINAGAR: More than 50 lakh voters will exercise their franchise in the 2017   assembly elections for the first time. These voters, aged between 18 and 22, became eligible to vote after the 2012 assembly elections.

 Gujarat chief electoral officer (CEO), B B Swain, said that from 3.8 crore voters in the 2012 assembly election, the number of voters has increased to 4.27 crore, an increase of 47 lakh. We expect to add around 10 lakh more voters, mostly in the 18 to 22 age group. This is a substantial rise in the number of first-time voters. 
 
 There were a total of 44,579 polling booths in 2012, which has increased to 50,218 (an increase of 5,639). 
 
 The number of polling stations has risen from 27,161 in 2012 to 28,640 in 2017. According to   norms, one polling booth is to be provided for every 1,200 voters in rural areas and 1,400 voters in urban areas. In geographic terms the norm is a booth within a 2km radius of every voter.”
 
 “We are holding awareness drives in colleges to get persons who have turned 18 registered and to inform them about their rights as voters. The 2017 elections will have the largest ever participation of first-time voters,” Swain added.
 
 It is expected that both the   and   will earnestly try to reach out to young voters, to win the most seats.
