KOTTAYAM: A 28-year-old   instructor, imparting lessons in self-defence to girls, was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student, police said on Wednesday.

 Identifying the accused as Jithu  , police said he repeatedly raped the minor girl, a Class V student, over the past several months in the dojo.
 
 The incident came to light when the girl confided the matter to her mother, who informed the police.
 
 A medical examination revealed that the girl had been sexually abused.
 
 Joseph was produced before a court and remanded in judicial custody for 14 days, police said, adding that he had not abused any other student.
 
 A child welfare committee member said the case was one of 'aggravated penetrative sexual assault'. The case was charged under sections 376 (F) and Pocso Act sections 5 and 6, which could warrant a maximum imprisonment of 10 years.
