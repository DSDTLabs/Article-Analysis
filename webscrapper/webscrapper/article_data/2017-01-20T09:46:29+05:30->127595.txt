THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The state government has given strict instructions to all government and aided schools in the state to furnish the   of all students from Class I to Class X to the government, latest by January 31. 

 The general education department's decision to assess the student strength in government/aided schools with the help of UID had faced several setbacks in the past few years. There were gross mismatch in the original student strength and the claims of the aided school managements. Some of the schools had even furnished the UID of grown up people to the government, as if they belonged to students in their schools. Following the mismatches, the government has decided to hold the class teacher, headmaster and school managers together responsible for any discrepancies.
 
 According to circular issued by the director of public instructions (DPI), the UID details of around one lakh students were still not available with the government.
 
 "The headmasters should ensure that the student details are entered on the web link provided on the IT@School website," the circular said. Several students who did not receive the UID number at the time of admission had furnished the enrolment ID which is given while registering for the UID. The UID number of such students should be updated with immediate effect.
