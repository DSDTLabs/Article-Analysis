AHMEDABAD: The state anti-corruption bureau (ACB) on Friday filed an   against the managing director and joint director of   ( ) Ltd after it found Rs 56.5 lakh cash in a search and seizure operation at the corporation’s headquarters in Gandhinagar on Thursday night.   also conducted searches at the residences of five officials, from whose offices the cash was found, along with their bank lockers.

 ACB officials said they carried out a major search operation at the GLDC office with seven assistant directors (AD) and 15 inspectors, searching more than 10 offices. The team found Rs 1.28 lakh cash from the office of managing director K S Detroja, Rs 40.52 lakh from the office of joint director K C Parmar, Rs 9 lakh from that of assistant director M K Desai, Rs 5 lakh from finance officer S M Vaghela and Rs 70,000 from the company secretary S V Shah.
 
 ACB found gold ornaments worth Rs 63 lakh from a bank locker in Patan, belonging to M K Desai. More searches will be carried out, said officials. ACB has intimated the income tax department about the searches at the properties of the persons involved.
 
 “The probe so far has found that both Detroja and Parmar were on extension after their retirement and were in connivance. The officials have been unable to explain the cash found in their offices. It is believed that Parmar was collecting money on Detroja’s behalf. We have filed an FIR under sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Detroja and Parmar,” said an ACB official. ACB officials said this is the biggest cash seizure at a government office during a search operation. It is also the first instance where industrial grade cash counting machines were employed and the first case where so many simultaneous searches (at six locations) took place.
