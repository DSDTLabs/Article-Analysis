AHMEDABAD: The use of the   has led to the event needing police protection. The dominant Darbar (Rajput) community objected to the word ‘Sinh’ suffixed to the names of the groom’s nephews. Certain Darbars threatened the family, residents of Golgaam village in Vav taluka of   district, with dire consequences.

 The dalit man involved, Kanji Bhadru, who has so far got at least 50 calls from Darbars, warning him to withdraw the cards, has been a policeman with Deesa town police for five years. The suffix ‘Sinh’ or ‘Singh’ is usually used by men of the Darbar community.
 
 Bhadru said that his younger brother, Hitesh, a computer operator with the village panchayat, is to be married on May 12. Considering the threats from Darbars of the village or nearby villages, Bhadru sought police protection for the pre-marriage feast on May 11 and the wedding procession on May 12.
 
 “I had printed the names of my nephews as ‘Uttamsinh’ and ‘Azadsinh’ in the tahuko (the invitation by children in a wedding card) section, which the Darbars objected to and they started threatening me on the phone. I have received at least 50 such calls since April 27, where various callers introducing them as Darbars threatened me with dire consequences if I did not withdraw the card. They even threatened to ruin the wedding. These abusive calls began flooding in after I sent the invitation card via social media to my relatives, and it went viral,” said Bhadru.
 
 Bhadru said anyone can use the suffix ‘Sinh’ in their name in a democratic country that is governed by the Constitution.
 
 Bhadru added that the Darbar callers also objected to the use of the word ‘haveli’ for the house of a Dalit.
 
 “I have sought police protection to conduct the event peacefully at my home,” added Bhadru. An FIR was registered with Deesa police on April 30 and inspector J N Khant has been conducting the investigation.
