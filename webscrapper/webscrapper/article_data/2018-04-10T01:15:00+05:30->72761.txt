Chennai: From denying Dalit Christians priesthood and opportunities to hold administrative positions in the parish to building separate caste-based chapels, a public hearing report has brought to light the practice of untouchability against Dalits prevailing in Catholic diocese of Sivaganga district.

 The findings of the public hearing was released here on Monday by the Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front (TNUEF) in the presence of the hearing committee's jurists including D Hariparanthaman, retired judge of Madras high court, V Vasanthi Devi, former vice chancellor of Manonmaniam Sundaranar University, and activist A Marx, among others.
 
 "The (Sivaganga) diocese has touched the zenith of untouchability practice in the Roman Catholic Church. Among the Catholics in this diocese, 25% are Devendra Kula Vellalar (a subsect of Dalits). In the 30 years since its formation, not a single Dalit community person has been ordained as priest. Some (Dalits) have been evicted from the seminary after several years of training," said K Samuel Raj, general secretary, TNUEF.
 
 The public hearing was conducted on March 16, 2017 at R S Mangalam in Ramanathapuram district. The trigger for the public hearing, according to Raj, was the refusal to ordain as priest Michael Raja, who was sent out of St Paul's theological seminary in Trichy for an alleged indiscretion. Though he was later absolved of the accusation, and allowed to complete the course, Raja was not ordained into the diocese which led to protests from Dalit community members, the report said.
 
 Around 700 people were interviewed during the course of the public hearing that was conducted in three sessions. "Even festival car of the chapels of caste Christians goes only to the area where they reside and does not enter the Dalit Christian streets in the same village," the report said.
