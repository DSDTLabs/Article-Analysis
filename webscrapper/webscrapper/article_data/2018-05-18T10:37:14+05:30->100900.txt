CHANDIGARH: The Hisar police has placed under suspension an SHO of a women police station after she was indicted in a graft case involving honeytrap, which was exposed after the arrest of her driver by state vigilance bureau on April 29.

 Inspector   Bala, the accused SHO, has been suspended after she had gone elusive after the registration of the corruption case against her. The vigilance team on April 29 caught Surender Singh, the driver of SHO’s car, and Yogesh Kumar, manager of a private hotel, while accepting a gratification of Rs 70,000 from a local resident, who was booked by women police station in a case of rape. During interrogation, the two revealed that of the total Rs 70,000, inspector   was to get Rs 60,000 while the remaining Rs 5,000 were to be pocketed by each of them.
 
 According to information, the cause of action dates back to April 26 when Rajesh (name changed) had approached vigilance police station with a complaint against Saroj. He informed the police that he had come in contact with a woman, who was part of the alleged honeytrap gang. Acting on her complaint, a case of rape was registered against him. Rajesh alleged that Saroj was investigating the case and had demanded Rs 3 lakh from him.
 
 He said later Yogesh approached him and claimed that he shall get the case settled in less amount as Surender was known to him. Consequently, they had rounds of talks and the amount was finally settled for Rs 70,000. On April 29, Surender and Yogesh were arrested while Saroj managed to escape and went into hiding.
 
 “Vigilance is doing its own probe. She has been placed under suspension on administrative ground and will face a departmental probe in both cases,” an officer associated with investigations said.
