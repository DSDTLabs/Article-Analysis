GUWAHATI:  , 37, a mountaineer from   and a mother of two,   for the   on Tuesday. She stamped her conquest by hoisting the national flag, handed over to her by the Dalai Lama in April, atop the world's highest summit. 

 Jamsenpa will attempt the second climb in the next 10 days, an achievement that will make her the only woman in the world to complete the double ascent feat twice. "She reached the summit at 9am IST. Anshu's double ascent expedition was flagged off by His Holiness Dalai Lama on April 2 from Guwahati. If she is successful with her double ascent, Anshu will add to her record of having climbed Everest five times," her PR manager Nanda Kirati Dewan said.
 
 In 2011, Anshu became the world's first woman to do a double ascent within 10 days of her first climb. She had taken a shot at the record of two double ascents in 2015 but the climb was called off due to the Nepal earthquake. Her third conquest of the world's highest peak was on May 18, 2013.
 
  "Anshu started at 1.45 am on May 13 (Saturday), and reached the top at 9am on Tuesday. She is fine and will attempt a double ascent," Dewan added.
