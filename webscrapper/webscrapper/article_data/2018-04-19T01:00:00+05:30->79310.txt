From playing a docile bahu in ' ' to a strong-willed wrestler in 'Ikyawann',   has come a long way. The actress admits that this role is a huge leap from what she has done in her previous shows. She says, “TV actresses end up repeating themselves; there is hardly any scope for them to do something different, but I was fortunate to get something different. Of course, when the makers of Ikyawann first approached me to play a wrestler, I was shocked. But then, I decided to take it up as a challenge. I didn’t have much time to prepare for the role, so I learnt the stunts on the set last week.” So, has she been asked to gain weight for her role? “Not really. In any case, I don’t have an issue putting on weight for a role. I don’t bother about looking slim on screen, I believe in looking the part.” 
Meanwhile, on the personal front, Rajshri denies rumours of link-up with her co-actor   from her previous show, Suhani... She says, “No, I am happily single and have no time for a relationship.”
