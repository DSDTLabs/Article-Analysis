LUDHIANA: In the incident of firing and alleged attack on Congress workers outside DAV Public School, BRS Nagar, which was the polling booth of ward number 75, Sarabha Nagar police registered an FIR against several persons, including  , husband of SAD candidate from the ward Sukhminder Kaur Bhinda.

 Others booked include Bhinda’s close associates, Harpreet Minkad, Kulwinder Singh Kinda, Arjinder Singh, Sameer, Sonu , Neetu Bajaj, Manik Bajaj, Harbhagat Singh, Davinder Singh and Sharanjit Singh. Sharanjit, who was rounded up on Saturday evening from a house opposite the polling booth where the violence and firing occurred, was sent to jail on Sunday. 
 
 The FIR has also been registered against 50-60 unidentified persons, who, according to complainant Congress worker  , injured the party supporters with rods, sticks and even fired shots. 
 
 However, police found no evidence of shots being fired. Assistant sub-inspector Jaspal Singh, who is investigating the case, said, “The complainant has claimed that he was shot at, but we cannot confirm this until we get any evidence. So far no shell has been recovered, but our investigation is on. Raids are also being conducted to nab the on-the-run accused.”
 
 City’s prominent businessman, Ramesh Mago, who is the owner of Kitty Bread, has also been booked. Speaking to the TOI, one of the close family friends said, “It is unfortunate that a case has been registered against Mago. He was not even there at the time of the incident. No one can believe that a dignified person like him can be involved in such an attack. He has been named in the FIR for supporting SAD candidate.”
 
 Apart from Mago, Neetu Bajaj and Manik Bajaj, the father-son duo named in the FIR, are owners of the house from where Sharanjit was rounded up. After the incident when Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and MLA   arrived at the spot, Congress workers said Bajajs helped the accused. Bajajs denied the claim when confronted by Ashu.
