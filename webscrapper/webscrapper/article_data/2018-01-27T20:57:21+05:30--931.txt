 The ICC and match officials later confirmed that the third Sunfoil Test match against India at the Bidvest Wanderers stadium will start as scheduled at 10am on Saturday. Play was suspended shortly before stumps on Friday. 
 
 The ICC issued the following statement: “The on-field umpires (  and  ) in consultation with the match referee, and after speaking with both captains and groundsmen, have decided that the Johannesburg Test will resume on time on Saturday. The on-field umpires will continue to monitor the pitch and consult with the match referee should the pitch deteriorate further. The welfare of the players is paramount and two of the most experienced match officials are in charge of the game and will take appropriate decisions. Play on Friday was suspended shortly before the scheduled close because the on-field umpires wanted to consult the match referee regarding the condition of the pitch.”
