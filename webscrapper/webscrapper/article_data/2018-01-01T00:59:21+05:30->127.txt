Chennai: Morning walkers and residents around Besant Gardens often have to fight with the   as road contractors use   to dump   from road repair work carried out elsewhere.

 Residents were shocked to see the road lined with debris two days ago and got it removed after complaints to civic authorities. People say this is a perennial issue. For over a week, residents claimed they have been seeing debris and mounds of mud settled along the otherwise well-maintained road.
 
 According to some residents, after road laying work was completed in nearby Gandhi Nagar, the debris removed after milling existing roads was dumped on the road side. In milling, the existing paved surface of the road is removed and recycled before laying a new road. 
 
 “The contractor carrying out road laying in Gandhi Nagar ensured that the existing road was milled before laying a new road but the problem has become in disposing the debris. It has been left along Besant Avenue and the corporation officials did not know about it when we informed them,” said a resident of Shastri Nagar. He also said locals had to keep constant watch to prevent the road from being used as a   by contractors. “We have complained and gotten debris removed a few times,” he added.
 
 A zone-level official, when contacted, said that no such thing was brought to his notice. “We have not seen dumping of debris on the road. It will be removed if spotted,” the official said.
