CHENNAI: Pedestrians on   are used to stray dogs feasting off overflowing garbage bins, but on Wednesday morning they were in for a surprise. A herd of spotted deer had escaped from the IIT Madras campus and made its way to a vacant plot of land near the American International School and passersby were seen feeding the ruminants, foraging for food below the MRTS corridor, watermelons.

 The herd had strayed off the green campus, contiguous with the  , where a spotted deer was run over by a vehicle on Tuesday. Anurag, a research scholar at the department of mechanical engineering, said deer often escape from the premises through the   gate. “They could be looking for food at the garbage vats outside. Sometimes they stray far off the campus,” he said.
 
 Wildlife ranger headquarters P   said a herd of deer that has strayed needs to be lured to a particular spot before being caged. “If the deer find food at the particular spot for a few days, they will start frequenting it. Then using a net or a cage, the animals can be trapped,” he said.
 
 Murugesan said before luring the herd, a couple of watchers will have to monitor its movement. “This will help in identifying the right place to keep the food. If the deer is seen in an open area, then it will be difficult to trap them as they can get frightened and sprint away,” he said.
 
 This is not the first time deer from the IIT campus have been in the news. Last year, in a reply to an RTI query, IIT-M had said that 220 deer and eight blackbuck died on the campus in two years.
