THANE: The much-delayed fifth and sixth railway corridor between   and   would be made operational by 2019 providing a much required relief for commuters travelling from these two suburbs. 

 The announcement was made by Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation (MRVC) officials during a joint inspection of progress of the work by MP Shrikant Shinde, Central Railways and officials from the civic corporation on Thursday. 
 
 MRVC said the work on the stretch was in full swing and could be operational in the next two years. The project is already behind schedule by several years and was expected to be completed by 2017 latest as was announced by a senior railway officer in 2015. “Work on a small tunnel on the route is complete while work on a ramp along the existing line is also in progress,” said an officer. tnn
