Historians estimate that this basadi was constructed sometime between 8th to 12th Century AD.

This capital of Tulu speaking population also has connections to Vijayanagar empire with Pandari Deva the governor of the region under Harihara II of the empire.

Remnants of Alupa kingdom can be seen in the area, highlighting significance of the area as a tourist spot.
