NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked state governments to mandatorily register FIRs in all “untoward incidents” happening in the name of  , the   was informed on Tuesday.

 Minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir said the responsibility to maintain law and order, protect life and property and check incidents of attacks on cattle traders, beef eaters, Muslims, Dalits and dairy farmers rested primarily with state governments.
 
 An advisory with regard to untoward incidents over cattle, disturbance of law and order by miscreants in the name of cow protection, compulsory registration of an FIR for cognisable offences irrespective of territorial jurisdiction, and making available a copy of the FIR has been issued to states/UTs, Ahir said in reply to a written question.
 
 PM   had on Sunday said it was the responsibility of states to check   and asked them to take “stringent action against anti-social elements”. The PM also sought the support of opposition parties in tackling “communal violence” in the name of cow protection, and slammed attempts at giving a political or communal colour to the issue.
 
 The   advisory on cow vigilantism, issued to states in August last year, had emphasised that though cow slaughter was a crime in most states, no person or group could take the law into their own hands in the name of protecting cows as Section 39 of CrPC made them liable to report such offences to the police or the nearest magistrate.
 
 “No person can, under any circumstances, take the law into their own hands. Any person, or persons, doing so have to be dealt with strictly under the relevant laws, and brought to justice,” the MHA had conveyed to the states.
