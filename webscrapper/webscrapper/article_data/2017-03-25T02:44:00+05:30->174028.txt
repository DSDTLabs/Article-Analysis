Kolkata: A Ponzi firm owner has been arrested for allegedly cheating small investors who parked a total Rs 150 crore with the company. This is the first arrest by the Directorate of Economic Offences (DEO) after it was set up by the Mamata Banerjee government in May 2015. The accused is Prashanta Chakrabarty, owner of Equinox Infratech Ltd. 

 The DEO has also taken over the probe into complaints against seven such firms including Alchemist and Rose Valley. OSD to the DEO Dilip Adak said they have drawn up the two cases based on separate police complaints. 
 
 Incidentally, Kolkata Police too has drawn up a separate case against Alchemist, hours before the HC asked CBI to take over the Narada probe on March 17. DEO officials, however, did not divulge the date they decided to take over the Alchemist probe. “We will share our investigation details with the CBI or any other central agency if they require any information from us,” the investigating officer said. DEO has the power to put the property under hammer to return the money.
 
 Chakrabarty has been found violating Section 3 under the new state law. “The local police arrested Pratik, Prashanta’s son. But Prashanta was absconding. We arrested him at Dharmatala,” said Adak.
