JABALPUR/  : MP high court on Saturday restrained   from rejecting NEET applications from candidates, who have lost a year between Class XI and XII. A division bench comprising Justice   and Justice   passed this interim order in the course of hearing a writ petition filed by NEET candidate Ayushman Shrivastava, who passed class XI in 2012 and class XII in 2014. 

 The CBSE counsel told the court that a similar case was pending before Delhi high court, which has passed an interim order. Madhya Pradesh HC then asked all the parties involved to inform about the Delhi court’s decision in two weeks and asked CBSE, which conducts NEET, not to reject the petitioner’s application till then. Ayushman’s counsel contended in court that CBSE’s condition of mandatory two years’ regular and study of physics, chemistry, biology at 10+2 level for NEET candidates is unreasonable and against Article 14 of Constitution.
