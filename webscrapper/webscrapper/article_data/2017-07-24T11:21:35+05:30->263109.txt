The   rejected the bail plea of actor   who was arrested for conspiring against the Malayalam actress' abduction and assault case. 

 HC said that there are strong prima facie evidences against the actor. He will be continued in remand. According to the reports considering the observation of the prosecution that there will be more involved in the case, HC said the entire incident is 'shocking'. 
 
  Dileep has already served 10 days in jail and had approached the High Court last week after the Angamaly Judicial First Class Magistrate court rejected his bail plea. The actor's counsel had argued at the Angamaly court that there was no proper evidence to connect him with the crime as the whole case against him is built on the basis of statement of the prime accused Pulsar Suni. The prosecution opposed the bail plea strongly saying that the investigation is progressing in the right direction and that allowing him bail at this crucial juncture would affect further evidence collection, including the original phone and memory card used to record the assault of the female actor.
 
  On February 17, the actress was abducted and molested by a group of men in Ernakulam. The Police have claimed that the conspiracy to abduct and assault the actress and film it was hatched by Dileep and Pulsar Suni.
