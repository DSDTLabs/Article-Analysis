NAGPUR: “After record-breaking 53 hours of cooking, I could have continued for more but I chose to halt,” said city’s celebrity chef   on Tuesday. In an interactive session at   on Tuesday, he said, “I thought if touch 56 hours, the next one could be 60 hours by someone else. What if my health doesn’t allow me to beat that record in future,” he asked.

 On April 23, Manohar brought laurels to city with his spoon and ladle by cooking non-stop for 53 hours beating the 40-hour record by Benjamin Perry of the US.

He turned down all the relief and medical care that was provided to him. There were times when he did feel a bit low but his greatest motivational factors were the peppy music and dance by the crowd. He was overwhelmed with the response he received when he served his recipes to visitors.
