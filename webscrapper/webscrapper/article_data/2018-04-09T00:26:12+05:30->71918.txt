Bathinda: Former Akali minister Sikandar Singh Maluka is not new to controversies either in Punjab or outside. Just as he has had to face heat of Punjabis at Melbourne in Australia on Sunday, he was met with opposition from some Sikhs in Abbotsford in Canada on July 19, 2015 as a result of which he had to cancel a political meeting. The then rural development minister in the SAD-BJP government, Maluka had further courted controversy by venting his ire at Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) by terming the Canadian police as ‘nalayak’. Then Punjab origin MP in Calgary (Canada) Devinder Shory had accused Maluka of criticising the Canadian police for narrow gains. In Punjab too, Maluka had remained in line of fire at his home turf of Rampura Phool in Bathinda and beyond for one reason or another. It was on July 26, 2015 that the anti-injustice action committee consisting of teachers, students, women, farmers and labourers had held protests in his constituency and accused Maluka of using his influence to get government senior secondary school principal Daljit Singh transferred from Bhagta. On November 19, 2015, Maluka was accused of misbehaving with old man Jarnail Singh of Hamirgarh village after getting into heated exchange with him over Bargari sacrilege incident, just two days after his tiff with labourers at Kotha Guru village. Previously, on November 25, 2016 Maluka got embroiled in a controversy when he had an altercation with a policeman during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Bathinda to lay the foundation stone of All India Institute of Medical sciences. He had then abused head constable Kanwaljit Singh when asked to park his vehicle away from the VVIP parking. However, Sikandar Singh Maluka was not available for comments.
