NEW DELHI: It's US President  's first   in the   and carrying on with the Obama-era tradition, he will host a dinner on the occasion for 200 Indian-Americans at 1600, Pennsylvania Avenue.

  The Indian-American community in the US hopes that Trump will address some visa-related issues with community members during this dinner. 
 
  In fact, the community is hoping Trump will also consider their request that he address a rally in Chicago for around 15,000 Indian Americans, said  , Trump supporter and founder of the ' '.
 
 In June, Trump famously ended a decades-long White House tradition of celebrating Ramzan with an 'iftar' dinner, so there were some apprehensions in the Indian-American community whether the Diwali dinner too would be canceled.
 
  It appears it won't.
 
 A similar Diwali dinner was first hosted by former US President Barack Obama in 2009. This White House Diwali celebration has since become an annual affair. 
 
  In a letter written this week to White House chief of staff John Kelly, Republican senator Orrin Hatch urged the Trump administration to make the Diwali bash even more grand. He said the Indian-American community's support for Republicans peaked in the 2016 US Presidential election and therefore the constituency's demands and concerns must be addressed seriously.
 
 The 'Republican Hindu Coalition''s Kumar, who advised Trump on campaigning in the Indian-American community, told TOI's sister publication Nav Bharat Times (NBT) that the White House is taking Hatch's suggestions seriously.
 
  The Indian-American community hopes 'Diwali Diplomacy' will help ease the community's fears about Trump's call for a stricter visa regime.
