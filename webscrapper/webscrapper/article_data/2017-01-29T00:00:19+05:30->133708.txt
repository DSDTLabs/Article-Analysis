 You may be cycling in the gym to attain those shapely legs, now how about biking under water? Pool biking is all about using rust-resistant bikes made especially for underwater workouts. It makes for complete resistance training for the body as sweating it out in water is a lot gentler on the joints than on land. It also improves flexibility as your muscles get more exercise.
  When you’re done with your workout for the day, you can just dive into the water for a quick cool down.
