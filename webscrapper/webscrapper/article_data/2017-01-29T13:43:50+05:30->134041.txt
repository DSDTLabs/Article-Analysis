DALTONGANJ: A joint team of   led by   and two officials from the   destroyed more than three acres of   on Saturday.

 Giving this information, DSP Barwar said that poppy cultivation was not burnt as the fire damages biodiversity in the region, besides creating pollution. Instead, the poppy farms were destroyed with the help of a tractor which battered down the plants without causing any damage to the land.
 Two or three days back the central team of   held a meeting in Daltonganj with DSP level police officers, to discuss the problem of poppy cultivation in Palamu.
 
 The strike against poppy cultivation on Saturday was one in a series of strategies drawn in the recent meeting of the central team of narcotics control bureau with Palamu police officials.
 
 He said the three acres of poppy lands were mostly under the forest department but some raiyyati lands have also been identified by the land revenue official accompanying the raiding team.
 
 Barwar said the most distressing part of the cultivation is that raiyyati lands belong to the tribal families of Kharwar who are either intimidated or tempted by the Maoists or other splinter group of the extremists to lend their land for poppy cultivation.
 
 He said, "Poppy cultivation on the raiyyati land will invite a criminal case against the raiyyats, to whom the land belongs and here the Kharwars will have to suffer as neither the Maoists nor the splinter group of naxals ever help the Kharwars in their distress."
