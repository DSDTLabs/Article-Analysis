 and his '  2' heroine   kicked off rehearsals for the   production last week. The film will go on the floors in August with a song, which also happens to be one of the opening sequences.

 A source close to the development revealed to Mirror, "The song will see Tiger and Disha perform a lot of acrobatics. Unfortunately, Disha was advised rest for two weeks after an ankle injury because of which there was a lull in prep. But she has recovered now and rehearsals are set to resume soon. The song is being choreographed by director  ."
 
  
  
 In the run-up to the first schedule of the actioner, a huge set is being erected at a Mumbai studio, after which, the team will head to Delhi for a month-long schedule. After wrap-up on the second schedule, Tiger will head to Hong Kong to train with acclaimed action director Tony Ching for at least a month in different styles of Wushu.
 
 While this is Tiger and Disha’s first film together, the rumoured couple has previously featured in the music video 'Befikra'. In the first 'Baaghi', which was directed by Tiger’s frequent collaborator Sabbir Khan and hit the marquee last year, the 27-year-old actor was cast opposite Shraddha Kapoor.
