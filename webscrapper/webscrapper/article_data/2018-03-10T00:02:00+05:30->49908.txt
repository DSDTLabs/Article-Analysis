Pune: Amruta Chaudhari’s heart skipped a beat when she heard his two-year-old hearing-impaired son call her ‘mummy’ for the first time. With the help of a cochlear implant and therapy from Big Ears Clinic at the KEM Hospital, her son Ishwar will now be able to lead a normal life. According to Amruta, Ishwar was born with hearing impairment. “We didn’t realize it until three to four months of his birth. He would not react to sounds around him and would sleep peacefully even under loud noise. We finally saw a doctor and he told us to conduct a brainstem evoked response audiometry (BERA) test. The result showed that Ishwar was completely hearing-impaired,” she explained. At the age of 13 months, Ishwar underwent a cochlear implant. The device is powered by a processor that amplifies the sound signal and stimulates the cochlea. Post his surgery, he had to go through sound and speech training, said Ishwar’s father Tushar Chaudhari. Now, at the age of five and a half years, Ishwar has completed his training at Big Ears Clinic along with 39 other children with his condition. All these children were dressed in black cloaks to receive certificates for their journey from silence to sound during a ceremony held here on Friday. Veteran actor Vikram Gokhale presented the certificates. “As many as 57 children were scheduled for graduation, but only 40 attended the ceremony. All of them are now fit to attend any school and lead a normal life,” said Neelam Vaid, associate professor at the department of ENT at KEM Hospital Pune and head of Big Ears Clinic. Gokhale said he was impressed with the combined efforts of the doctors, staff and donors towards improving the life of these children.
