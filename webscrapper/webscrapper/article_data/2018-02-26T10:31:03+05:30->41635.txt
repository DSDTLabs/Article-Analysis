PUNE:   kept their playoff hopes alive after humiliating   4-0 in an Indian Super League game at the Balewadi stadium here on Sunday. A brace from   top scorer   and a goal apiece from   and   handed Pune their heaviest defeat of the season in which they also had skipper Marcelinho sent off.

 
 Pune remain in second place with 29 points from 17 games while Goa move up to sixth with 24 points from 16 games. Lanzarote had the first chance of the match in the eighth minute as he cut in from the right on his favoured left foot and tried to curl it in but the ball went straight into Pune keeper Vishal Kaith's arms.
 
 Pune left-back   then headed the ball just wide from Marcelinho's chipped free-kick a couple of minutes later.
 
 Both sides struggled to find any fluency until the half hour mark when Pune's Adil Khan clattered into Boumous inside the 18-yard box and the referee pointed straight to the spot. Lanzarote sent Kaith the wrong way and put Goa 1-0 up.
