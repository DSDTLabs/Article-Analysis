Calangute: Waste water treated at the sewerage treatment plant (STP) at Baga, Calangute, will be pumped to the garbage treatment plant (GTP) at the Calangute-Saligao plateau, and will not be released into the Baga creek, said deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo.  The sewerage treatment plant issue was rasied at the last gram sabha at Calangute and questions rasied for not completing the project. Lobo told TOI that once the STP at Baga starts functioning in the next few months, the treated water would be pumped through a ‘reverse pipeline’ to the GTP, and used to water plants there. The public works department (PWD) would shortly be issuing tenders for connecting the hotels, resorts and other commercial establishments in Calangute to the sewerage pipeline network which is close to completion. “In the first phase we will only be connecting the commercial establishments,” Lobo said, adding that the sewerage pipeline network has been completed in all the wards of Calangute, except in Gauravaddo where work on 80 connecting chambers and 18 manholes is also pending. “It should be completed in the next two months. There are 18 manholes remaining to be completed on the main road from Jhambleshwar temple to Kamat holiday homes, which we are taking up now as we wanted to avoid the digging work during the peak season.”  “Also, land for two pumping stations at Gauravado has already been acquired,” he said.
