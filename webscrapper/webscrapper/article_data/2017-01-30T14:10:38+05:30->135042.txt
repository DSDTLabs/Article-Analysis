While women around the globe are giving a tough fight to gender issues, a rather revolutionary move comes from within the city. In a survey conducted by  , a leading Internet   providing beauty services at home, Mumbai women have said that dark   is something they don’t worry about. This indeed comes as a pleasant surprise for a country obsessed with fair skin. 
 
 Pratichi Basu, an advertising professional says, “While most matrimonial ads still feature the typical, ‘Fair, tall and slim’ as the key requirements to be acknowledged as an Indian bride, this is a refreshing change. Yes, most Indians have dark skin and I don’t think it’s a hindrance for us in any way, neither career wise or in our personal lives. Hence, we need not worry about it.” Pratichi thinks slowly and steadily the society is undergoing a change, which will help empower women in more ways than one.
  
 This is something that makers of skin lightening creams must take note, that women of today are defying the notion that dark skin is something they need to worry about. The survey was included 512 women in the age group of 17 and 35 from Mumbai and Pune, and only 2 per cent of all respondents said they were worried or concerned about the   of their skin.
  
 Richa Singh, CEO at BigStylist.com said, “As the leading Internet salon, we are committed to provide the best quality salon experience at home and in order to do that, we wanted to better understand the skin-related concerns of our customers. The findings of our survey are indeed startling and have broken many stereotypes about how Indian women perceive their skin.”
  
 In fact, the findings of the survey further corroborate the media reports in recent years that the sales of fairness creams are experiencing a declining rate of growth.
