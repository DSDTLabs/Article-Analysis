NEW DELHI: India’s growth rate will improve to 7.4% in 2017-18 and 7.6% in 2018-19, remaining ahead of China, the   said in its economic outlook for the region. The bank said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to invalidate high-value bank notes is likely to have a positive impact over the medium term.
 
  “Along with the forthcoming implementation of the goods and services tax,   will widen the tax net and improve tax compliance,” ADB said in its flagship economic publication on Thursday.
  
  It said with more people channelising their savings into banks, there will be more money to lend at lower rates. A drop in aggregate deposit costs should improve bank profitability, further increasing their lending capacity, it added.
  
  On November 9 last year, the government withdrew the legal tender status of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes.
  
  The ADB report noted that the move was aimed at checking corruption, counterfeiting and funding of terrorism.
  
  “This decision augmented measures introduced earlier to fight corruption, including tax amnesties to encourage the disclosure of black money, agreements with other countries to share banking information and the renegotiation of treaties to avoid double taxation,” it said.
  
  The Asian Development Outlook (ADO) 2017 said the impact of demonetisation is dissipating with the entry of replacement notes in circulation. It said stronger consumption and fiscal reforms are expected to improve business confidence and investment prospects in the country.
  
  Asia’s third-largest economy grew 7.1% during 2016-17.
  
  “In India, the sub-region’s largest economy, growth is expected to pick up to 7.4% in fiscal year (2017-18) and 7.6% in 2018-19, following the 7.1% registered last FY,” ADB said.
  
  On China, the bank said overall output growth is expected to slow to 6.5% in 2017 and 6.2 % in 2018, down from 6.7% in 2016.
  
  The Chinese government’s efforts to maintain financial and fiscal stability would continue to be a modest drag, it said, adding the continued structural reform would help in maintain growth in the target range. ADB said South Asia will remain the fastestgrowing of all sub-regions.
