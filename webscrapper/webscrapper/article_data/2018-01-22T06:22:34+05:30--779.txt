AMRITSAR: A young Muslim researcher from Pakistan has urged Sikh devotees visiting his country not to limit themselves to just paying obeisance at gurdwara, rather explore the layers of Sikh history there.

 Jahandad Khan (26), who hails from Hazara in north-eastern   province of Pakistan, said that Sikhs only visit   and  , whereas Pakistan had layers and layers of Sikh history.
 
 “There are so many battlefields, forts and infrastructure set up and built by the Sikhs. They were not only fighters but also builders,” said Khan.
 
 Khan was awarded for his work by Guru Gobind Singh Foundation, Washington. He said the world had a great deal to learn from the Sikh legend  .
 
 “My parents used to tell us that our home was built by a Sikh, who was the commander of a great Sikh army. That led me to study more about Nalwa. My journey has taken me on an overlapping quest to connect with my own identity, and I have learned that my own roots connected me with great legends like Hari Singh Nalwa and Maharaja Ranjit Singh, along with other Sikh heritage,” he said.
 
 He said that his message to the youth was to understand history rationally.
 
 “I would also like to appeal to Sikhs, particularly to youth, to come to these places. There is no substitute to interaction with the local population,” he said.
 
 “We are pleased to see Jahandad’s passion for Nalwa and his drive to create better understanding among Sikhs and the people of Pakistan, especially in the Hazara region. We feel that his work needs to be supported by all Sikhs and by major Sikh institutions,” said Guru Gobind Singh Foundation secretary Rajwant Singh
 
 “Nalwa is a great role model for the youth and his life needs to be presented in a creative manner. Nations, especially India and Pakistan, and the people in the   can take clues from Nalwa's life to create a better environment in the entire region.”
