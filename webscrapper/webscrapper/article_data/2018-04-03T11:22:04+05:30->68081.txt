 HYDERABAD: Hyderabadis were shocked on Monday after petrol and diesel prices shot up to their highest in four years. While the   will pinch people’s pockets, many were more concerned about the upward spiral expected in essential commodities.
 
 The hike in prices has come as a major blow to people in spite of the regular fluctuation in petrol and diesel prices for months. On Monday, prices stood at Rs 78.19 per litre for petrol and Rs 70.28 per litre for diesel.
 
 
 Md Gulzar, a 22-year-old ice cream van owner, who has to buy fuel every day to run his business, said the price hike was not easy to cope with. “Some months back, my daily expenditure on fuel was Rs 100 and now it has increased to Rs 150. It is a big deal for people like us,” he said.
 
 When petrol prices were highest in the state in 2013, at Rs 83.07 per litre, it cost the government more than $100 to buy each barrel. Now, the government is shelling out $70 per barrel.
 
 
 Kashish Naredi, the owner an   in Somajiguda said, “Daily customers sometimes are not even aware of price fluctuations and the price hike because it has become a daily routine.”
 
 
 Joint secretary of Consortium of Indian Petroleum Dealers,  , said people should have paid 30% less in petrol and diesel than four years ago, when prices were quite high. “But now we are ending up paying more for impure oil that contains ethanol. The silence of the government and the opposition parties is alarming,” Amaram said.
