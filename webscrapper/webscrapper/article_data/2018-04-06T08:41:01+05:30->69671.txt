 According to BSF sources, at about 5.30am in the morning the 79th Battalion of BSF, patrolling the Vigokot border, noticed movement near Pillar No. 1,127 on the international border. “We found a man, dressed in a shabby Pathani suit. He said his name is Mohammed Ali and he is from Valinki Kot in Tharparkar district. We have arranged for an interpreter as he only knows the Sindhi dialect spoken in Tharparkar district,” said a senior BSF official.
