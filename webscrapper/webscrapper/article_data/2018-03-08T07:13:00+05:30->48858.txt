Chandigarh: Even after an hour of struggle on Wednesday, the residents of Manimajra couldn’t connect to the telephone   of the municipal corporation to report non-functional street lights.

 Poonam, who lives in a duplex housing complex of Manimajra, said that she had tried all three helpline numbers of the MC (5009333, 5009444, and 5009555) on Tuesday but got only one response: “The number you have dialled is not correct.” The two street lights near houses 5683 to 5686 are dead for the past one week, so the residents face a lot of insecurity and commuting trouble after dark. She searched these helpline numbers on Google and tried for almost an hour to get her complaint registered with the department concerned.
 
 She said the civic authorities concerned should upload their correct telephone numbers on the website so that the residents are not harassed while reporting their grievances.
 
 In the dock
 
 The civic authorities have issued these toll-free numbers to the residents to help them report their electricity problems 24x7. If residents are finding an issue in connecting to the response team, it must be some technical snag from the backend. There is no problem from the corporation side
