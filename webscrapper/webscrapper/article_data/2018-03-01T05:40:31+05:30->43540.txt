NEW DELHI: Wedding celebrations turned sour when a bridegroom died during   in east Delhi's   during his ghudchadi ceremony on Tuesday evening. Two of  's friends are the prime suspects and have been apprehended. 

  Recalling the incident, family members spoke about how their life changed within minutes. "We didn't even hear the gunshot and just saw Deepak collapse," said his aunt, Kavita Devi. "Some of the women in the family were getting ready at a beauty parlour nearby when the ceremony started. Before his mother and sister joined the function, he dropped unconscious, with a bullet injury in his head. Everybody is still in a state of shock." 
 
 "The gunshot was fired around 8pm, soon after which we rushed Deepak to the hospital. At 11pm, the doctors told us that they have removed the bullet from his head and will discharge him on Thursday, but only when we began to thank God, they told us that he has succumbed to his wounds. Our world collapsed that very moment," said Devi.
 
  "One moment everyone was dancing around Deepak and the next moment they were gathered to help him," said Radha. "There were over 200-250 people in the when it happened. This seems to be like a well-planned attack more than a celebratory firing. The men had fired more than seven times," she sobbed.
 
 The bride's brother, who too was present at Deepak's house when TOI visited, said,"Deepak was to get married to my youngest sister. She is in a state of shock and is inconsolable ever since she heard the news,".
