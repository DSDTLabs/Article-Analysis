Kanyakumari: Nine minor boys staying at the Government Adi Dravida Welfare hostel for boys at Kuzhithurai in Kanyakumari were allegedly subjected to repeated penetrative sexual assault and abuse by their cook for nearly three months. The shocking incident came to light last week when a teacher came to know about the abuse of a boy, following which eight more boys of the hostel also gave written statements on the sexual abuse they were suffering at his hands. District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) officials who conducted an inquiry with the boys on Tuesday night and Wednesday said that there were 25 boys in the hostel who were studying in two government middle and higher secondary schools at Kuzhithurai. It is learnt that the boys were safe till their previous cook got transferred about three months ago. The trouble started after his assistant Vishwambaran got promoted as the cook. The warden of the hostel at Thuckalay was in additional charge of the one at Kuzhithurai and did not stay here. Hence, Vishwambaran and his assistant Wilson stayed at the hostel. “The abused boys were from third to seventh standard. They said that Vishwambaran used to get drunk at night and force boys into oral and penetrative sex. He also tortured the boys who resisted his actions,” said district child protection officer (DCPO) S Kumuda. She told TOI that the matter did not come to light so far as he had threatened to kill them if they complained to anyone. “The remaining boys in the hostel were from classes 8 to 12 and were staying on the first floor. They did not face sexual abuse, but were victims of physical abuse. The abuser also forced the boys to do the hostel work including toilet cleaning,” she added.
