BENGALURU: Some 30 children studying at Sri Chaitanya Techno School, Nagarbhavi, west Bengaluru, were rushed to a private hospital by panicky parents on Monday, who thought they fell ill because of the measles-rubella (MR) vaccine.

 Doctors, however, said the vaccine had nothing to do with the kids feeling uneasy and nauseated; all of them were discharged within an hour. Dr Harish J of   said: “Around noon, some 30 kids came to our hospital. Parents said the children had been vomiting and were also giddy .They said the children had taken ill after they were administered the MR vaccine.We checked each child and found that only one had experienced uneasiness and vomited. In this case, the child hadn't eaten properly. The others might have fallen ill because they panicked. We assured the parents and kids that the vaccine had no sideeffects,“ he added.
 
 School principal   said: “We have a nodal doctor and a team from the government on the school premises, and they have a tieup with the Unity Lifeline Hospital India. The hospital had informed the school and parents that if the kids experience any sort of discomfort they should be taken to the hospital. We had clearly informed the parents that symptoms of weakness would be evident soon after vaccination. We were aware of the situation and had also called for an ambulance.However, the students were rushed to the hospital in the schoolbus itself."
