NEW DELHI: The   on Wednesday sought response from the CBI on a plea filed by a convict in the   assassination case, A G  , seeking recall of its order upholding his conviction in 1999 in the light of revelations by a former CBI official that he left out some statements while recording his confession. 

 V Thiagarajan, a 1981-batch IPS officer, had recorded the confessional statement of Perarivalan in 1991 in which the accused had admitted that he had purchased two batteries and handed them over to Sivarasan, which were later used to detonate the human bomb to kill the former PM. 
 
 Perarivalan also stated that he was not aware of the purpose for which the batteries were bought and did not know about the assassination plot. But Thiagarajan later admitted he did not record this part of the statement as the probe was still going on at that time. The officer in his affidavit told the court that the convict didn’t know about the plan to
 
 kill the former PM and his version of not being aware about the plot was not recorded in his confessional statement which was heavily relied on by the courts to convict him. The officer’s affidavit said Perarivalan’s particular statement was “omitted” from his confessional statements. “It is humbly stated that accused Perarivalan’s statement that
 
 he was totally in the dark as to the purpose for which the batteries were purchased was not recorded by me, because it would be an exculpatory statement and hence the whole purpose of recording the confessional statement would be lost. Further, I did not deem it fit to record this exculpatory statement because the investigation regarding the bomb was pending at the time of recording the confessional statement,” he said in his affidavit. 
 
 The officer’s statements is contradictory to the SC verdict. Agreeing to hear Perarivalan’s plea to re-examine the case, a bench of Justices   and R Banumathi asked CBI to file its response on his petition within three weeks.
