MUMBAI: The family of a ride-hailing company's cab driver who died in a   incident in the eastern suburbs last month will get Rs 4.5 lakh, the company has announced. 

 Saleem Shaikh, 38, who was thrashed by three youths on Ahilyabai Holkar Marg at Shivaji Nagar in   on February 12 over overtaking, had died of his injuries.
 
 Shaikh, an   driver, is survived by his wife and two small children, and was the sole bread earner for the family. He had taken a vehicle loan to buy a WagonR which he was driving for Ola. The family fell on very hard times after his death. The compensation will come as a major relief.
 
 "My uncle was earning a handsome amount from Ola. He used to pay an EMI of Rs 12,000, besides bear other expenses of the household and the children's school fees. Now with uncle dead, we have not paid a single instalment. Ola informed us that they will compensate, but we don't know how much," said Shaikh's nephew Azaz. 
 
 Ola officials told TOI they are handing over a demand draft of Rs 4.5 lakh so that the vehicle loan can be cleared. "On humanitarian grounds, the company is also considering appointing Shaikh's close relative to run the car so that the family gets a monthly income," said a spokesperson. 
 
 On February 12, three youths on bikes had dragged Shaikh out of his car, thrashed and kicked him after a row over overtaking. One of them smashed Shaikh's head on the ground before fleeing. An unconscious Shaikh was taken to Rajawadi Hospital by passersby, but died within a few hours of admission.
 
 The Shivaji Nagar police is all set to file the chargesheet against the three -  , 19, Abdul Wahab, 21, and Wajid Ali, 20 - who have been arrested under the IPC sections for murder. They were tracked after an eyewitness gave the police the registration number of one of their bikes.
