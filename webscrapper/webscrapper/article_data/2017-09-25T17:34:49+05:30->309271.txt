 The movie that stars   and Samantha in lead roles is based on a village backdrop, and even features Anasuya in a key role. Rumours state that she might play Ram Charan’s character’s menatta (aunt) in the film and only time can tell if this is true. 
 
 Recently, the filmmakers shot a few scenes in Godavari and shifted the shoot to Hyderabad. A set worth Rs 10 Cr has also been reportedly set up in Hyderabad for the same. The film’s unit is on a short break though as Ram Charan is reportedly said to be busy with the pre-production of his father Chiranjeevi’s ‘Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy’, also starring Nayanthara, Amitabh Bachchan, Sundeep, Vijay Sethupathy and others in key roles. 
 
 Recent reports state that Sukumar is planning to rope in a Bollywood beauty for a special song in the film and it’s Bebo and PeeCee’s names that are doing rounds. In fact, some reports also state that Bebo has already given her vebal consent for the song and that an official announcement will be made soon!
 
 While the reports are unconfirmed, it is fun to imagine Bebo or PeeCee shaking a leg alongside mana Mega hero Ram Charan. The first look for the film that will have music by Devi Sri Prasad is expected to be released on Dussehra by Power Star Pawan Kalyan.
