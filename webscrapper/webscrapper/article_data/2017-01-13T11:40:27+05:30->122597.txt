 He also informed that police patrolling teams have been asked to prevent haba daba, a local form of gambling prevalent in rural areas in Kolhan.

 "Earlier this month, Ichagarh MLA, Sadhu   and the district administration were at loggerheads following the BJP leader's adamant stand on organizing cock fight for Tusu in Domuhani but the issue was resolved after the MLA relented," said a senior police officer of the district. 
 
 "We cannot let anyone demonstrate cruelty against animals on the pretext of community tradition and festive ritual," said People for Animal volunteer,  . 
 
 Veteran environmentalist K K   also expressed disappointment on the killing of animals for personal pleasure. "Injury to animals is normal in fighting contests and in some cases the injured animals die on the spot. We cannot play with the lives of the innocent animals just for pleasure's sake," said Sharma, who heads the state chapter of Indian Society of Chronobiology.
