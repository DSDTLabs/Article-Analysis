LUCKNOW: The ongoing Yadav family drama, rapidly degenerating into a farce, witnessed yet another volte-face by   (SP) patriarch  , who called a press conference on Friday to make a “big announcement”, only to call it off minutes before it was to begin.

 Prior to the presser-that wasn’t, possibilities of a truce had brightened — and not for the first time in the last few weeks — when   called on his nephew   at his CM residence at 5, Kalidas Marg, inviting him for talks with Mulayam at his home in presence of senior party official Azam Khan.
 
 Around the same time, another Mulayam loyalist, Ambika Chaudhary, met Azam at his residence, inviting him to join discussions with his son.
 
 But, the proposal collapsed after Azam learnt that the “root cause” of the family unrest,  , too had reached Mulayam’s house for the meeting. The two camps then began blaming each other for the failed attempt at securing truce.
 
  MP   accused “Mulayamwadi” Amar of derailing the efforts of other seniors to work out a compromise between Mulayam and Akhilesh.“He is the cause of the problem, and if he wants the issue to be resolved, he should stay away from the family and the party and quit the Rajya Sabha,” Agarwal said, accusing Amar of acting as an agent of the  . 
 
 Reacting to Agarwal’s charge, Amar said it was an irony that people who have switched sides several times before joining SP, are pointing fingers at him — a direct reference to Agarwal’s party-hoppings in the past.
 
 “I want to clarify that I am no hurdle in the path of Akhilesh Yadav,” Amar said, adding that he too was in favour of a patch-up between the two sides. “Whatever is happening in the party is not because of me but because of a supporter of Akhilesh,” he said, hinting at  , who has been Akhilesh’s mentor in the theatrical Yadav war.
