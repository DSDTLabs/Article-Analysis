NEW DELHI: Hailing the   government’s tough stand on ‘One Belt one Road ( )’ issue, RSS’ economic wing   (SJM) on Sunday exhorted the Centre to bar all Chinese companies from government tendering processes, restrict imports from the neighbouring country and keep Chinese firms off investments in India.
 
  In a resolution passed by its National Council on Sunda in Guwahati, SJM has welcomed the recent government moves to boost indigenisation in government procurement by way of the amended Rule 153 of General Financial Rules 2017 and called for a full-fledged legislation on the lines of Buy America Act, 1933 for preferential treatment to Indian companies.
  
  “This act of the government would definitely free the government's procurement of Chinese and other foreign goods. Swadeshi Jagran Manch demands that the government should extend this preferential policy to the indigenous services also and no foreign consultants and foreign service providers should be hired in the government departments. Apart from saving valuable foreign exchange this would go a long way to reduce foreign influence on our policy making”, the SJM resolution said.
  
  “We further urge upon the central government to persuade state governments to follow the suit for preferential treatment to the ingenious goods,” the resolution adds.
