 Keshav Kumar, in-charge director, ACB, said that in past one year there is lot of emphasis on making water tight cases. Due to which many accused in the high profile cases have been denied bail after thier arrest. Moreover the conviction rate has gone up from 21% in 2016 to 31% till July this year.
 
 “It would surely be a good exposure for the future lawyers to hone their skills while they work with a government agency,” he said.
 
 ACB officials said that the students are working closely with the legal advisor of the agency and helping find references for corruption-related cases including important judgements from across India to prepare better case papers. They added that the intern-ship opportunity also allows working closely with the field team and helps in creating awareness about legal rights.
 
 Saubhagya Dubey, a fourth year student from GNLU who is heading the team, said that for them it is a whole new world compared to the course work at the university. “We compiled the relevant orders for the agency by Gujarat Vigilance Commission (GVC) and went through ACB manual. We also understood the process of a case - right from trap to conviction,” he said.
