Actor   has compared the 'Black Panther' movie to a ' ' film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

 "When I first started talking to Marvel, one thing they were interested in was for Panther to be their version of James Bond, which I thought was incredibly interesting and exciting. It was a really outside-of-the-box way to look at T'Challa," Coogler told Total Film magazine.
 
 He added: "There are some Bond films that I really, really like, and it gave me the opportunity to go watch some other ones."
 
 The movie is based around the first ever black superhero in mainstream American comics who was created by legendary   writer   and the equally iconic artist-and-writer Jack Kirby and first appeared in 'Fantastic Four #52' back in 1966, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
 
 The motion picture is expected to expand on the storyline that was first introduced in 'Captain America: Civil War' of how T'Challa becomes the superhero.
 
 T'Challa's father T'Chaka is king of the African nation Wakanda and has the ceremonial title Black Panther as the chief of the Panther Tribe, but is killed when a bomb goes off at the UN, making his son the Black Panther.
 
 The film stars Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, Forest Whitaker, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman and Andy Serkis.
 
 'Black Panther' is slated to release in February.
