Margao: Around 129 pilgrims from Goa will be travelling to Saudi Arabia for Haj in July this year, All-India Haj Committee vice-chairman Shaikh Jina, said.  Haj is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca and a mandatory religious duty for all physically and financially capable adult Muslims.  “We are grateful to Union minorities minister Muktar Abbas Naqvi, chief minister Manohar Parrikar, and South Goa Lok Sabha MP Narendra Sawaikar for ensuring that Goa continues to remain an embarkation point,” Jina, who is also a BJP functionary, said. tnn
