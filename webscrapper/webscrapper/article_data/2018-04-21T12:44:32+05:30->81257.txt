 and Jackie   are all set to give a Gujarati twist to Priyanka Chopra’s Marathi movie ‘Ventilator’.

 Earlier this year,   became a part of the Gujarati version of Priyanka Chopra’s Marathi movie ‘Ventilator’. And now, a Gujarati bahu in real life Juhi will be featuring alongside Jackie. The actress will be making her debut in Gujarati movies with this one. 
 
 She was quoted in a tabloid saying that it had been wonderful time working with   (Jackie Shroff) and that he is one of the most chilled out co-stars ever. She added that Jackie is a person who is everyone’s friend and that they will be working together after a long time. She also revealed that it was her co-star Jackie who had initially told her that the producers of the Gujarati movie were considering her for the role. 
 
 Juhi will be essaying the role that was played by Boman Irani in the original Marathi version of the film – she will be playing the character Dr Shroff.
 Juhi, the 'Gujarat ni bahu’ (everyone calls her that because she is married into a Gujarati family. Jay Mehta is her husband) is mighty thrilled to be a part of this film because she had always dreamt that she would be working in one film in every Indian language. She has already been a part of Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali and Punjabi films.
