THANE: Senior NCP leader   has criticized the   likening them to a warring couple who is washing their dirty linen in public. The leader claimed that the verbal spats between the parties after their split and ahead of the civic polls seemed to be staged and in all likelihood the parties will patch up to assume power in Thane and Mumbai. 

 The NCP leader was in Thane on Thursday night to participate in a public rally. “The   and   fight seems more like a husband and wife tiff. The quarrel looks staged and the parties would, in all likelihood, unite after the results are announced,” said Sule. The NCP senior leader said that cities like Mumbai and Thane faced so many civic issues that needed to be addressed. Instead, the ruling parties were busy mud-slinging, she said. 
 
 Meanwhile,   got a taste of the peak hour Mumbai and Thane traffic congestion due to which she was forced to step down from an open air van and ride pillion on a bike. Sule was supposed to reach Thane at 7:30pm to attend a rally at Khopat but was getting late as she was stuck in traffic. So, she decided to ride pillion on a bike driven by a party activist to reach Thane in time. 
 
 However, activists have raised questions about how she did not adhere to the traffic norms as she drove down nearly 30kms riding without a helmet. Interestingly, none of the traffic cops stopped them for flouting the rules.
