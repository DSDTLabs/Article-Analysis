NEW DELHI: Chief minister   has urged lieutenant governor   to clear the schemes for   of   and quality  . Both   were re-sent to the LG’s office on Thursday.

 An official said that the two schemes were among the topics discussed during a regular meeting between the   and the   on Wednesday. “Both schemes are of significant public interest. People of Delhi would benefit a lot with their implementation,” Kejriwal tweeted on Thursday. 
 
 In December last year, the LG had returned the proposal to offer doorstep delivery of 40 public services for “reconsideration” to the government over various issues, including traffic congestion, pollution and security. It triggered another controversy with the government rejecting the concerns and accusing the LG of trying to protect a corrupt system. 
 
 The scheme aims to provide services such as making of caste, income and disability certificates at the doorstep of every Delhiite. Currently, people have to travel to the office of the subdivisional magistrate to get the certificates. Under the health scheme, people who can’t have surgeries at a government hospital will be entitled to undergo the same for free at private hospitals. The bill, for which no upper limit was set, will be paid by the Delhi government. The government claimed that the “LG has also raised objections to it” as he had asked the government to include an income criteria.
