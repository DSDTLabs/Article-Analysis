Rajkot: Patidar agitation leader Hardik Patel will now join farmers of 12 villages of Ghogha taluka in Bhavnagar who are protesting against state-run company the Gujarat Power Corporation Limited (GPCL) taking possession of their land for its lignite based-power project, nearly two decades after it was acquired. The Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti leader will address a public rally in Ghogha on Sunday. The district administration has already imposed banned assembly of four or more persons in the 12 villages who are opposing GPCL’s move. Farmer leader Narendrasinh Gohil circulate a message among the villagers asking them to gather on the crossroads of Ghogha Surka road and Bhavnagar Koliyak road on Sunday evening.  “Hardik is coming to support our cause. As per the new act, if the land is not used for five years after the acquisition, the land should be handed over to the original owner and acquisition process should be done as per new law,” Gohil said. Of the total 2,980 hectare land required, GPCL has acquired 1,415 hectare of government and private land between 1997 and 2005 in three mining blocks — Ghogha-Surka, Khadsaliya-I and Khadsaliya-II. The remaining 1,565 ha will be acquired in phases once the power plant, which is to be set up by GPCL subsidiary Bhavnagar Electric Company Ltd (BECL), is fully commissioned. tnn
