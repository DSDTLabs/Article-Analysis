While most actors say that their film career took off in Mumbai,   feels that it was Delhi that set his foundation as an actor. “I started my career from Delhi. This was the city I came to to accomplish my dreams. I used to stay in South Ex and got my portfolio made in a studio in Malviya Nagar. Whenever I come to Delhi, I think of my struggling days when I would travel in crowded buses for auditions. Those memories are still precious to me. This is the place where my dreams actually took shape,” Sonu tells us. The actor was here to promote his film ' ' with his co-star Amyra Dastur.

  Sonu says that this year already looks like an exciting one to him. 'Kung Fu Yoga', that also stars Jackie Chan, is already making waves overseas, and his other Chinese film, ' ', was China’s official entry to the Oscars. “I am very excited that my film was in the race for an Oscar,” he says, adding, “China has great infrastructure and techniques and I think India and China should make many films together. Indian actors are working in Chinese films and vice versa, and both countries are gaining from this exchange. The two countries might share a different relationship politically, but cinema is bringing them together. More Chinese filmmakers now want to come to India and make films here. Director Stanley Tong (who has also directed Kung Fu Yoga) is very keen to come to India and work with me on a film.”
