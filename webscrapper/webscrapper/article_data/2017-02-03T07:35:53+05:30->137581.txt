Ahmedabad:   on Thursday ordered the state government to pay three months’ pending salaries to 39,965   in response to a PIL. 

 A bench of Chief Justice R S Reddy and Justice   directed the authorities to pay the salary for the month of November by February 10. In next ten days thereafter, the salary for December has been ordered to be paid, said petitioner-advocate K R Koshti. In his PIL, advocate   submitted that non-payment of salary and allowances – Rs 204 per day - to Home Guards has left their families in deep trouble. He urged the HC to direct the state authorities to immediately release the withheld amount to Home Guards. The bench headed by Justice M R Shah had earlier questioned the petitioner why none of the Home Guards has made this complaint on their own.
