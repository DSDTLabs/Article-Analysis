BHOPAL: Witch doctors are on the hit list of suspects of   STF (wildlife) for the death of tigress in   jungles.

 A team has been dispatched to Seoni for investigations.
 
 Remains of the tigress were found on the Kanha-Pench corridor on Saturday with its claws and jaw hacked off.
 
 This is the same area from where four witch doctors were arrested for inciting tribals to kill tigers and leopards with a promise to “rain money in new notes.” The ‘new note rain’ was said to be a part of a con that has been underway much longer, with the tantriks initially promising tribals to double the money in their bank accounts through spells performed with the felines’ paws.
 
 Unsuspecting, illiterate tribals had killed three tigers and as many leopards in the Kanha-Pench jungle corridor in four-five months that year. More than 50 people were arrested.
 
 STF officials believe that people associated with the same gang must be involved in killing of this tigress too.
 
 Their interrogation revealed that tribals killed the big cats by electrocuting them, and then burned the carcasses after removing the paws. They killed two tigers using electric traps connected to an 11KV line of the   project, located between the Kanha and   tiger reserves.
 
 In 2016, forest officials had first got a whiff of the foul play when a tiger’s carcass was found at Sitapathor in Balaghat on November 20 with all the paws chopped off. The skin and fangs — for which tigers are generally poached — were intact. Same happened in this case too. “There must be a link between the old and new case.
 
 We are working on it,” said an officer. He said sorcerers are involved in the killing of many more animals.
 
 Meanwhile, another tiger was found dead inside Kanha taking death toll of the big cats in MP to 30. Officials said it was killed by another tiger over territorial supremacy. No poaching suspected.
