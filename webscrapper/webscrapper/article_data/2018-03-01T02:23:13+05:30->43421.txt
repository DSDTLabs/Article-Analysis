Pune: Japanese manufacturer Horiba expects to increase its business in India because of emerging emissions-related regulations across the country. 
 
 From April 1, 2020, the tailpipe emissions for motor vehicles will be measured as per the Bharat Stage-VI emission standards. Even the Central Pollution Control Board is prescribing new emission limits for factory emissions. 
  
 So far, the company imported most of the testing equipment into India that automakers and other plants used for testing in their factories. The company has now introduced an exhaust gas manufacturing system in the country that will measure emissions of large engines like high-power gensets, emissions at thermal stations etc. 
  
 “It would be particularly effective in highly polluting industries like electric power, cement, iron and steel, pharmaceutical, fertilizers, refiners, pesticides, textiles and tanneries to name a few. Since the system is designed to handle harsh process conditions it can be extremely useful for any industry that emits gaseous pollutants into atmosphere to monitor its degree of pollution as prescribed by the pollution control boards,” said Jai Hakhu, chairman, Horiba India. 
  
 The company said it is looking to get a 20% market share in this segment in the next couple of years. Horiba, which recorded about Rs 350 crore of revenue in the year ended 2017, expects to be Rs 500 crore company by the year 2020. 
  
 Also, the company is looking at a couple of places in Maharashtra and Karnataka to set up a medical reagent manufacturing base at a cost of Rs 100 crore. So far, the company said it has invested Rs 200 crore in the Indian market.
