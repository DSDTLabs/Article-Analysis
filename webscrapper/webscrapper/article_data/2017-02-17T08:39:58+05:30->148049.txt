PIMPRI CHINCHWAD: The BJP, after much delay, plans to release its manifesto by Saturday, four days before the municipal elections.

  president and Chinchwad MLA Laxman Jagtap said the party is planning to release the manifesto through chief minister   who will address a rally on Saturday in Pimpri. Fadnavis had come last week to launch the election campaign. Party sources said the chief minister was keen on BJP getting a full majority in Pimpri Chinchwad. If he cannot release the manifesto, guardian minister   will do so on Friday.
 
 On the rebellion and independents, Jagtap said, “There were over 500 aspirants for tickets. We could give nominations for only 128 seats. We have been able to pacify most of the rebel candidates. In the next few days, we would be able to calm some more. We have denied nominations to 40 NCP corporators. The BJP will win 70 to 75 seats.”
 
 Meanwhile, defence minister   will address a rally at Talawade on Friday. State president Raosaheb Danve and education minister Vinod Tawde will address more rallies in Pimpri Chinchwad on Friday.
