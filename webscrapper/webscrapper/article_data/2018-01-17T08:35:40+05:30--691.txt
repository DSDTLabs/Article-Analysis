DIBRUGARH: In a major offensive, suspected militants of NSCN (Khaplang) and Ulfa (Independent) allegedly attacked a fleet of crude oil tankers at Jagun in  's   district on Tuesday, in which, at least eight tankers were gutted. 

 A fleet of 10 fully loaded crude oil tankers was to reach the Digboi oil refinery from Kharsang oil field in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Due to threats from militant groups, the tankers get police protection from Namchik Gate up to Digboi refinery. On Tuesday, however, the drivers were waiting for the escort team to arrive when a group of 15-20 armed militants reportedly reached the spot around 4.50pm and opened indiscriminate fire targeting the tankers.
 
 The miscreants also took away one tanker and snatched the cellphones of the drivers. Four families travelling in the route in private vehicles had a narrow escape after coming under the range of gunfire, sources said.
