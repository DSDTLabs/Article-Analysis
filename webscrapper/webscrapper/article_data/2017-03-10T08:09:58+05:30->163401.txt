On the night of March 6, the trio along with their associates Muneer and Prithvi had stolen a cell phone from daily-wage worker Ch Srikanth at Spicy Dhabha in Ghatkesar. "The accused noticed Srikanth alone relieving himself on the road-side. They threatened him and snatched away his cellphone. Srikanth tried to chase the thieves on his bike, but they managed to flee in Muneer's auto," Ghatkesar inspector B Prakash said.
 
 Based on a complaint lodged by Srikanth, police registered an extortion case on March 7 and analysed the nearby CCTV camera footages. Police found the getaway auto's registration number (AP 24 TA 7649) in the footage and picked up auto driver Muneer. Based on his confession, Mahesh, Uday, Rohit and Prithvi were arrested on March 8 from their houses in Balaji Nagar. Police also recovered the stolen cell phone.
 
 As SSC and inter question papers were kept in the lock-up of the Ghatkesar police station, the arrested accused were made to sit outside the lock-up while police constables kept a watch on them.
 
 "At 2.30 am on Thursday, Mahesh, Rohit and Uday requested one of the on-duty constables to permit them to go out to attend to call of nature. The constable accompanied them for some distance, but the trio went to a blind spot behind the station and vanished," the inspector said. As the trio did not return, the constable raised an alarm and senior officials were alerted about the incident. 
 
 A manhunt was launched and two of the fugitives, Mahesh and Rohit were caught at the Bhongir.
