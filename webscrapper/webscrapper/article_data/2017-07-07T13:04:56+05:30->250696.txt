BHUBANESWAR: CBI on Friday conducted simultaneous raids at 12 locations in the country, including Puri and Bhubaneswar in connection with an alleged tender scam, surrounding former railway minister Lalu Prasad Yadav. 

 Lalu’s role came under scanner after he “fraudulently” awarded leasing of two railway hotels in Puri and Ranchi to a private hotelier in 2006, CBI sources said. CBI said Lalu, during his tenure as railway minister, allegedly rigged and manipulated tenders to help award the operational management of the   (BNR) heritage hotels at Puri and Ranchi to the hotelier. 
 
 According to CBI’s FIR, copy of which is with TOI, the railways had transferred the BNR hotels to its subsidiary Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) in March 2004. “After Lalu was inducted as the railway minister in May 2004, he allegedly conspired with Harsh Kochhar and Vinay Kochhar of Sujata Hotel Private Limited (proprietors of Hotel Chanakya in Patna). Lalu in connivance with former   managing director P K Goel rigged and manipulated tender documents and handed over the BNR Hotels’ operational management to Sujata Hotel Private Limited,” the FIR copy read. 
 
 CBI officials said the company in return transferred a 3 acre land in Western Patna to a benami firm of Lalu in very low cost. “Subsequently, between 2010-14, the land was transferred to  , owned by family members of Lalu,” said a CBI officer. 
 
 The BNR Hotel at Puri was set up in 1902, a year after the introduction of the Calcutta-Puri train service by the erstwhile Bengal Nagpur Railway (now South-Eastern Railway). While the railways managed the hotel for long time, the sea-facing property went to the hand of private player —   — in 2006-07, sources said. 
 
 The heritage hotel was a delightful sojourn for towering personalities like Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi, filmmaker Satyajit Ray and music director S D Burman, hotel sources said.
