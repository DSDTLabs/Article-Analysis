PATNA: College of Arts and Crafts campus is buzzing with activities for the 79th   of the institution which will be celebrated on January 25. At least 240 students are taking part in different activities to make the foundation day function a success despite the prevailing cold weather conditions in the city. 

 The students start their work as early as 10am to give a facelift to the art landscape of the campus for which the raw material is provided by the college administration. While the first year students are busy in decorating the campus with motifs and installations, those from fourth year are coordinating with their juniors.
 
 Prakriti Bhusan, a first year student, was engrossed painting Madhubani art on the boundary wall of the college. “This is my first foundation day programme and the seniors are guiding me in making various art forms. I am eagerly waiting for the celebrations,” she added.
 
 Kumari Simple and Uma Kumari were busy rolling a roller on limestone as part of lithography.   is the process of printing from a plane surface (such as a smooth stone or metal plate) on which the image to be printed is ink-receptive and the blank area ink-repellent. “It takes a day to make one painting,” claimed the students. 
 
 Ankita Raj, a fourth year student of the college, said innovation was the key for budding artists to excel in the industry. “Artists should employ new methods and ideas to tell a story,” she said. Ankita has used doodle art form and drawn a village scene on the wall, which is different from the other paintings. 
 
 Students can also be seen making 3D graffiti art forms on campus. “One of the works depicts comic element ‘Joker’ and ‘Captain America’. “3D graffiti art is quite popular in metros. The work requires a great deal of attention and creativity,” said  , a fourth year student of the college.
