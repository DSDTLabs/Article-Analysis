CHANDIGARH: Members of the Haryana   employees’ unions observed a strike at Hisar and Jind on Thursday. They were protesting against the new state transport policy that gives more routes to private bus operators. Though the union members did not allow any bus to run from the Jind bus stand from 10.30 am to 12 noon, commuters at the Hisar bus stand suffered from 9 am to 7.30 pm.

 Speaking to TOI, Haryana Roadways Sanyukt Karamchari Sangh president Dalbir Singh Kirmara said, “Despite earlier assurance by the state government on April 13 to employees’ unions, private bus operators were allowed to start operation as per the new policy.”
 
 He added as the private bus operators entered the Jind bus stand on Thursday morning, employees’ union members closed the bus stand. It was only after transport authorities assured that private buses would not operate as per the new policy till the next date of hearing of the case in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on May 16, that transport buses resumed operations from Jind.
 
 Kirmara also informed that in Hisar, representatives of eight employees’ unions met deputy commissioner   and also held talks with transport minister Krishan Lal Pawar on telephone. After he assured that private buses would not be allowed to ply before May 16 as per the new policy, Haryana roadways buses resumed operations around 7.30 pm at Hisar.
 
 Kirmara said the employees’ unions’ representatives would be meeting additional chief secretary of transport department SS Dhillon on May 16 at Chandigarh.
