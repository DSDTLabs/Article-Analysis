ABOHAR: Resignation of   councillor   from presidentship of   municipal council has left the saffron   in a quandary. Party sources said   did not consult the party or local BJP legislature before submitting his resignation. 

 In an emergency meeting held at the residence of Arun Narang, BJP MLA late on Saturday night, the party did not accept the resignation, terming it unconstitutional and unwarranted. At the meeting, headed by district BJP chief Vishnu Bhagwan Dellu, office-bearers deliberated on the sudden move. Party members expressed unhappiness at the fact that Kalni did not discuss the issue with them before going public with the decision.
 
 "Since the party has not received a formal letter from Kalani informing about resigning from the positions of president and councillor, therefore the question of accepting the resignation does not arise," said Vishnu Bhagwan.
 
 Meanwhile, all efforts to reach Kalani for the second consecutive day proved futile. His mobile phone is switched off and family members declined to comment.
