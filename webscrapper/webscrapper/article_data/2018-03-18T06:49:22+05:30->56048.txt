 Following the leak of the summary that was questioned by the   high  , the hospital intiated a probe and an ethics committee looked into the matter.
 
 
 Commodore Indru Wadhwani, CEO, Mallya Hospital, said the   was issued on Saturday, but he refused to reveal the contents of the notice. “His services have not been terminated, as wrongly reported in some sections of the media. An internal committee is looking into the matter,” he said.
 
 ‘Statement contorted’
 
 Dr   said his statements had been contorted. He said that he has been condemned without being heard. He added it was highly improbable for anyone to pass derogatory remarks if they had studied the discharge summary prepared with reference to the entire case sheet and his professional opinion.
 
 “My statement in the discharge summary will stand vindicated on a perusal of the entire case sheet,” he said. He further stated that he was not aware of medical records produced in court and would not comment on it.
