MUMBAI: Oshiwara police has registered a case against a 23-year-old woman for reportedly publishing   article on her   account. The case was registered on April 18 based on a complaint received from a resident from Andheri (west). On learning about the complaint, the suspect approached the city sessions court that rejected her bail application. Later on May 18, she approached the Bombay high court and got an interim bail.

 Investigators said the woman has posted an article on Facebook which is defamatory in nature and has hurt the feelings of a particular class of people from the society. “The arrest will be done based on the court proceedings. At present the woman has got an interim bail and the anticipatory bail application hearing is scheduled on June 8,” said senior police inspector  .
 
 Investigators are yet to recover the said mobile phone of the applicant from which the said post was published. 
 
 A case under the Indian Penal Code sections 153 (A) (1) (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) has been registered against the woman.
 
 On May 18, the applicant’s advocate   argued that his client’s custodial interrogation may be avoided as she is a woman and that she is willing to co-operate with the investigating agency. 
 
 Thus, Justice A S Gadkari ordered that the applicant accused be released in the event of an arrest on a Rs 25,000 bond. Also, the accused has been asked to attend to the investigating officer and co-operate with the investigation.
 
  The high court also ordered that she shall not tamper with the evidence and/or influence the prosecution witnesses.
