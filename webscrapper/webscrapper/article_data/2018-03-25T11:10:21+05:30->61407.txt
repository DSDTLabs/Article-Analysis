INDORE: While the beauty of   still allures several visitors from near and far, the lack of basic amenities becomes a big turn off for the tourists who come here to behold its beauty with their own eyes.

 Known across as the best garden palace in the Central India, today Lal Bagh stands beside an unmaintained garden with its speciality – the red roses- nowhere to be found. Pigs and dogs can be found roaming around in the garden, making it even worst for people, who come from far places to relax in the open area. Moreover, with no dustbins available in the garden, people end up throwing the garbage near the trees and pavements across the garden.
 
 “The palace is as beautiful as I had read. But, the campus is not at all in a good condition. It’s just the opposite of what I had read in a travel website that said it has a beautiful garden. Plus, the washrooms are outside the campus and in a sorry state,” said Isha Sharma (26), who had come from Jaipur for the first time to visit the palace.
 
 There is no canteen on the campus and it becomes a task to get refreshments for the tourist. Moreover, the only drinking water point that is available on the campus is in a bad condition.
 
 Nishant Muley, who had come to visit the palace for the first time from Nashik, said “We’ve been to Lal Bagh palace in Vadodara and there we found all the basic amenities like canteen, proper drinking water dispenser and washrooms. Here they don’t have these facilities.”
 
 Although, the visitors find the palace beautiful from the inside, most of them crib about the unavailability of the basic facilities. 
 
 Speaking to TOI,   deputy director KL Dabhi said, “I have taken note of the lack of the basic amenities. We will ensure availability of the basic amenities on the premises of the palace as soon and possible on a priority basis.”
