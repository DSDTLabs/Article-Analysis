MUMBAI: Street children have brought to a halt the escalator at   on several occasions by activating the emergency stop button, preventing many passengers from using the facility since it was opened on Monday. 

 The escalator has an opening in the non-ticketing area on the station's east and connects the new footbridge at the station's north. Railway activist   said, "When I complained to the railway administration, an official told me children keep pressing the red emergency button. Every time this is done, the system needs to be reset."
 
 Following complaints, the railways deployed security personnel near the escalator. When TOI visited the site, it found that children were attempting to alight from the escalator in the wrong direction and a teenager had brought his bicycle close to the escalator's entry. All this was going on despite the presence of security personnel.
 
 "People in the area, especially parents, should be cautioned. A misadventure by children may prove fatal. Blame will have to be shared by the railways."
 
 Commuters have slammed the railway administration for poor maintenance of the new facilities at the station. Thane resident   said, "The newly constructed footbridge is occupied by street children. It's like a second home for them. Many use the ticketing area as a shelter."
 
 Another commuter,  , said, "None of the indicators at the bridge work. I have stopped using it."
