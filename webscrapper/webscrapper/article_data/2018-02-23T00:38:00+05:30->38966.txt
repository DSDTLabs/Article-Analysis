Coimbatore: Don’t be surprised if an electric vehicle comes to your gate to collect garbage. The city corporation has placed an order to buy 50 such vehicles with a capacity of 350kg to ease the workload of its sanitary workers and to speed up garbage collection. “We will provide these vehicles to all the zones and purchase more once they are put to use. We will employ drivers on contract to operate them. A sanitary worker will collect the waste and put it in the bins,” said a corporation official. Currently, battery-operated vehicles are being used in ward 90 in Kovai Pudur, at the city airport and at Sarvanampatti by NGO NO Dumping. But, it uses them only to collect and transport waste and not for door-to-door collection. “When it comes to door-to-door collection, we need to see how useful they will be. Every sanitary worker covers at least 3kms in a ward a day,” the official told TOI. “We will ensure that the sanitary workers are trained and all the difficulties will be resolved,” said a senior corporation officer. City corporation commissioner K Vijayakarthikeyan had inspected a vehicle at the corporation main office recently. “The order has been placed and the vehicles will reach the city in a couple of days. They will also help us improve our ranking in the Swachh Sarvekshan,” said a zonal sanitary officer. City-based activists said that while the heart was in the right place, the infrastructure for such an initiative was not available. “These vehicles will be very useful. But, they can be operated only for eight hours. We need to charge them regularly. There will be difficulties if the vehicle stops at some location,” said an activist. Charging points need to be set up in various locations in case of interruptions, he added.
