TRICHY: Drought-relief of Rs2,247crore announced by the new chief minister   on Tuesday has failed to appease debt-ridden delta   in Tamil Nadu who seek   of Rs25,000 for each acre of crop loss.

 The chief minister said that the monies would be released directly into the bank accounts of the farmers. Of the total Rs2247crore, he allotted Rs2049crore as compensation for agriculture cultivation mainly paddy for 28, 99,877 farmers who cultivated on 46, 27,142 acres. As per the announcement, the farmers will get Rs5465 per acre for paddy and other agriculture crops, as compensation.
 
 Farmers say that this compensation is meagre, considering the expenses incurred for cultivation. “The state government believes that this small amount will comfort the farmers. The irony is that the government itself sanctions Rs24,000 per acre as crop loan. But when it comes to compensation, they sanction only Rs5465 per acre,” said President of Tamil Nadu   Coordination Committee PR Pandian in Trichy, adding that the drought had claimed the lives of 275 farmers in Tamil Nadu last year.
 
 The farmers also urged the government to take into account uncultivated land for compensation. “Due to uncertainty over release of water, the farmers left 70% of fertile lands uncultivated. So, the government should consider such farmers eligible for compensation,” said district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam Ayilai Sivasurian. 
 
 Late chief minister   had waived off crop loans of marginal and small farmers soon after her victory in the assembly elections last May. The farmers now wanted the government to make the bigger farmers eligible for this benefit.
