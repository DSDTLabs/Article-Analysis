Chennai: Samvardhana Motherson Reflectec (SMR), part of the Motherson group, is setting up its third plant in Wallajabad near Chennai.  The auto parts maker is looking to expand capacity by 30-40% with its new facility as well as add new products like actuators to the range.  The company’s existing plants make rear view mirrors, mirror glass, wiring harness and other parts for well-known vehicle makers like Hyundai, Nissan, Ford and Daimler India Commercial Vehicles. The company's two older factories are on Poonamallee Highway. Refusing to divulge investment for the new Chennai plant, G N Gauba, CFO, Motherson group said, “Our overall capex for the current year for India is Rs 200-250 crore and next year too we will spend around Rs 200 crore on capacity addition and new products in India. Whenever we add fresh capacity, it means we have already reached at least 80% capacity utilisation at our current location. Apart from rear view mirrors, we make a host of parts in Chennai including wiring harness, plastic parts for the dashboard etc. The new location is close to our OEM clients like Ford and Nissan.” The company had acquired the land a few years ago and the building is currently underway. Given that the new plant will expand capacity by 30-40%, there will also be significant additional employment opportunities though the company is tightlipped about the numbers. The capacity expansion is the result of an uptick in automotive demand as well as the company’s strategy of making more products inhouse. The group has been investing aggressively both in India and abroad with nearly Rs 1,800 crore earmarked for its overseas capex this year alone.  “Next year the India share of the capex will be more,” said Gauba.The company recently consolidated its factories in Noida to accommodate an expanded capacity as well as in-house production of newer parts, he added.
