Pune: Long hours spent in front of gadget screens, coupled with air pollution, have prompted many to start using anti-glare or blue-cut zero-numbered spectacles.

 Over the last few years, the demand for such spectacles has shot up with many ophthalmologists prescribing them.
 
 Gauri Deshpande, a city-based IT professional, says, “Working in an IT company, my screen-use time is long. I felt my pupils had begun to get very dry. I opted for these zero-number anti-glare glasses and the dryness in my eyes has reduced.” 
 
 Meenakshi Bhagli, an ophthalmologist, says dry-eye syndrome and computer vision syndrome (CVS) have been on the rise. “Screen-use time has gone up with smartphones and computers being used for almost everything. The ultra-violet radiation from the screens causes dryness in the eyes. Also, during spring, many people suffer from allergies due to pollen, dust particles and pollution in the air,” she adds. Bhagli adds these spectacles reflect the UV radiation and help keep the eyes moist. “We tell people to wear zero-number glasses whenever they are outdoors, especially when travelling on bikes or autorickshaws,” she says.
 
 Supriya Mulik, an optometrist, says, “Mostly, people working in the IT sector purchase either anti-glare or blue-cut glasses.”
 
 Kiran Ingale, manager of an eyewear store, says, “We get 4-5 enquiries for anti-glare zero-number glasses daily. The demand is not limited to any age group,” she says.
