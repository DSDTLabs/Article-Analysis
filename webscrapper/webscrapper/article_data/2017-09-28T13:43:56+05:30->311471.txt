Actor Dileep's latest film 'Ramaleela,' in which he plays a politician put behind the bars, is finally in theaters after getting delayed for about 3 months. Waiting for the first half review highlights? Here they are! 

 In an out and out political thriller of 2 hours 38 minutes duration, Dileep plays advocate Ramanunni, who was the MLA of leftist CDP. Son of Rakthasakshi Raghavan, he develops differences with the top leaders of the party and leaves it to join the opposition NSP. Certain scenes and sequences of the movie may seem coincidental to real life. However, unlike what was expected, the actual story of the film is far different from what has been happening to Dileep in real life. But, will the second half half have more of instances that resemble his life? We will have to wait and watch! 
 
 
 
 The first half is promising, tightly edited and fast moving. There are jokes but they are not the typical humour one is used to seeing in a Dileep film. He doesn't go the usual over the top exaggerated slapstick route either . Prayaga plays the female lead, while Radhika acts as his mother whom the party pits against Ramanunni as the rival candidate.
 
 Will the second half too be as entertaining as the first? Keep checking out this space!
