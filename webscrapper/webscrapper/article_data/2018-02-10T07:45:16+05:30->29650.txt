AHMEDABAD: A  , Subramaniyam Parniwel alias Ghetiyo, was shot dead by city crime branch personnel in 2009. However, on government records, he is alive and lodged in jail, nine years after his death. 

 Ghetiyo was the last of the series of the encounter killings involving city police, especially crime branch. Convicted, accused and wanted in various crimes, the last offence registered against Ghetiyo was with crime branch for extortion calls to a leading city-based builder. A few days later, on May 16, 2009, he was allegedly killed in a shootout near the   flyover by a crime branch team. He got a bullet in his head.
 
 However, on January 30, the state government told   high court that Ghetiyo was in a jail in connection with some crime.
 
 The cause for the authorities bringing Ghetiyo to life so casually is a case registered against him in 1998, when he and others was booked and convicted in a case of loot in the Maninagar area. He was convicted in 2002, which he challenged before the high court.
 
 Ghetiyo's appeal came up for hearing 16 years later. The superintendent of Jamnagar district jail sent his remarks on the case on January 24 by fax, saying, "The accused has already completed his sentence on February 24, 2005, and he is undergoing imprisonment as an undertrial prisoner in some other cases." This statement was recorded by Justice  . The judge disposed Ghetiyo's appeal as infructuous after so many years, particularly when he had already served his term for the loot he had committed.
 
 Ghetiyo's advocate,  , who was not at the court proceedings, was bemused at such a submission by the authorities. "Ghetiyo was killed nine years ago in a police encounter, so how can he be lodged in any jail now?" the lawyer asked, questioning the casual attitude of the jail authorities in informing the high court about the status of a prisoner without verifying facts about his existence.
