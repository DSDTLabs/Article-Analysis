AMRITSAR: With the entire official machinery working overtime following molasses leakage into   river that had left hundreds of fish dead, people living in the vicinity of Bhagatanwala   in Amritsar wonder if the government was waiting for a disaster to happen before it came to their rescue.

 “We wonder whether the government is waiting for a tragedy to happen or death of people living in neighbourhood of the toxic dump before it acts,” Sanjay  , president of Sanjhi Sangarash Committee ( ), told TOI.
 
 People living near   dump, especially in the ward numbers 37, 38 and 39 of the Amritsar municipal corporation, are fearful of contracting diseases owing to round-the-clock billowing of smoke from the simmering heaps of garbage in the landfill, said SSC general secretary Naval Chawla. He said fire in the dump on May 21 had made the air hazy.
 
 According to Central Pollution Control Board ( ) air quality monitoring machined installed near the Golden Temple, fine particulate matter in the air referred as PM 2.5 in the air quality index (AQI) was 264 on May 21, which shot to 474 on May 22, posing a threat to healthy people and endangering those with existing diseases. It came down to 220 on May 25, which comes in poor category giving breathing discomfort to the people on prolonged exposure.
 
 “When the government is doing so much after death of fish due to pollution, why it has kept it eyes closed when human beings are dying a slow death. Does the government wants some calamity to happen here too?” Chawla said.
 
 Kurl said those who dump the garbage, often set it on fire to make place for throwing more waste. He said rag pickers also set the garbage to fire to find something valuable for them.
 
 “We have appealed to almost everyone be it politicians or bureaucrats, but nothing has happened so far,” he said, adding that they were left with the last resort to resume their agitation to get the dump shifted from the area.
