KOLHAPUR: Over 14 vehicle organisations across the district on Wednesday staged a demonstration and   of the Centre’s Government   (GR) on the licence fee hike in the   (RTO) premises. They warned to continue agitations till the decision is revoked.

 Through the 22nd amendment in the Motor Vehicle Act, 1989, the Centre had hiked various fees like licences for learners, renewal, transfer of ownership and endorsing the purchase or lease agreement.
 
 The vehicle organisations started raising their voice against the resolution with agitators chanting slogans against the state and central government. They also criticised the government over its promise of ‘Achhe Din’.
 
 Subhash Jadhav   district lorry operators’ association president led the   and blamed the Centre for keeping vehicle organisations in the dark over this decision.
 
 “This is another blow after demonetisation which has ruined our business. We were trying to recover from the note ban, but the hike in various vehicle fees has crippled our business. We could have understood the 10% hike, but they hiked the fees by 300%. We can’t justify such a hike as it is exorbitant and should be immediately revoked. We will not stop until they cancel the GR. We have decided to organise protests at the taluka level,” Jadhav said. 
 
 The district chief of the Maharashtra Wahatuk (transportation) Sena Chandrakant Bhosale, said, “We were not expecting such a decision under the ‘Achhe Din’ dream of the government. The decision shows that the government doesn’t want common people like us to live a normal life. We are already under the burden of various taxes and insurance fees.”
 
 Organisations handed over the petition of demands to regional transport officer. RTO D T Pawar said, “We do not have the power to cancel the hike. We can send the demand to the Centre and only they can take a decision on this.”
