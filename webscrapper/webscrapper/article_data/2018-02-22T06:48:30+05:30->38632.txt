KOLKATA: Calcutta   vice-chancellor  , who had been on the campus since Tuesday, left on Wednesday evening after being holed up in her office for over 30 hours.

 The VC had been on the campus when around 50 students — among the 57 who have been barred from appearing in the first and third semester examinations in the Bengali MA programme as they had failed to meet the requisite 55% attendance criterion — went on a dharna outside the Bengali department in Asutosh Building.
 
 The total number of examinees for these two semesters was 753.
 
 Though the students said they had not prevented the VC from leaving the campus, the she said since the girls are agitating overnight on campus, she too will not leave office till the students return home. “Today, I came out because I was feeling extremely unwell,” she said on Wednesday.
 
 On being informed about the ruckus, the VC left her office on Tuesday evening and went to the Bengali department on the College Street campus. The teachers who had been held hostage were freed, but the VC returned to her office and stayed overnight. Along with the VC, pro-VC (academics)   and pro-VC (finance) too stayed on the campus. They too left on Wednesday.
 
 The number of protesters came down to around 25 by Wednesday evening. Some students claimed that though they were in class, attendance was not registered. Others claimed their inability to attend classes was due to dengue and floods in their districts.
