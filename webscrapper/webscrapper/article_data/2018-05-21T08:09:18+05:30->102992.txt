NEW DELHI: The build-up to Delhi Daredevils’ IPL-11 campaign was woven around the return of   to his home, Ferozeshah Kotla — the ghar waapsi for the hero. But as another disappointing campaign for Delhi came to a close, the 2018 season will be remembered for the emergence of another Delhi boy,  , as a force to be reckoned with.

 
 
 
 
 The 20-year-old was one of three players retained by DD apart from Chris Morris and Shreyas Iyer who replaced Gambhir as captain midway through the season. Despite his relative inexperience, the Daredevils management backed his talent and domestic form, especially in T20s where he had scored a record 32-ball ton for Delhi in Vijay Hazare Trophy this season.
 
 
 
 
 Leading the batting chart after the league stage was over with 684 runs, and the highest knock of the season, 128 not out against SRH, to his credit, Pant has been head and shoulders above anyone else in the Delhi squad.
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 It’s not just about his runs but the manner in which he has scored them. His season kicked into gear against Royal Challengers Bangalore with a 48-balls 85, even as Daredevils succumbed to AB de Villiers’ brilliance. But Kotla was where the southpaw found his true range with scores of 69, 128*, 61 and finally 64 on Sunday afternoon against the Mumbai Indians.
 
 “It was an outstanding season for Rishabh…he was fabulous in an otherwise disappointing season for us. He currently holds the Orange Cap but Kane Williamson (Sunrisers Hyderabad) is breathing down his neck. I hope he manages to hold on to the Orange Cap as it will be a just reward for his hardwork,” Daredevils coach Ricky Ponting said about Pant.
 
 The century against the Sunrisers, albeit in a nine-wicket loss, stood out for the sheer audacity of strokeplay, especially the way he took apart Bhuvneshwar Kumar. On Sunday too, on a slow Kotla track, where most of the other batsmen struggled to force the pace, Pant muscled his way to a 44-ball 64 with four massive sixes.
