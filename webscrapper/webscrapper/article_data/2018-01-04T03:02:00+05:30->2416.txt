Panaji: In the wake of a “series of happenings that threaten the very idea of India”, including the latest “uncalled for attack on the Dalits” in Pune, the Catholic Bishop’s Conference of India ( ) has appealed to leaders across the political spectrum to recognise that groups and individuals sowing hatred are increasing and being emboldened. It has also urged that cow vigilantism, which has created a fear psychosis in parts of the country, be ended. 

 “We need to come down heavily on mobs of whatever colour or shade they may be. Groups and organisations indulging in violence or even threatening to take law into their hands should be dealt with severely. Individuals, whether ministers, members of parliament or even local leaders, who indulge in disruption of communal harmony, should be publicly denounced by their parties and action should be taken against them,” CBCI secretary general, Bishop Theodore Mascarenhas, said in a statement issued on Wednesday. 
 
 Appealing to preserve brotherhood, peace and harmony in the country, Mascarenhas also referred to St Mary’s Post Graduate College in Vidisha, Madhya Pradesh, where ABVP activists have threatened trouble on Thursday. The college has already been attacked once, when some persons scaled its walls and demanded that a certain type of worship be enforced by the college.
 
 “This type of terrorism is unacceptable. This false nationalism must stop. That mobs of these type are being emboldened, as was earlier seen in Satna, is worrying and disturbing,” he said, adding, “Assurances of pre-emptive action on January 4 from the police in Madhya Pradesh, to thwart the threatened attack by goons on St Mary’s College has boosted the confidence of our Fathers there.”
 
 He, however, appreciated PM Narendra Modi’s desire to work for all Indians. The statement also thanked home minister Rajnath Singh for ensuring safety during Christmas celebrations.
