KOLKATA: The supply of compressed natural gas ( ) or coal-bed methane (CBM) to greater Kolkata has hit a major roadblock. The   government has said that supply of green fuel will only be permitted in the   ( ) area. This, at a time when   (India) has finalized a joint venture agreement (JVA) with the Greater Calcutta Gas Supply Corporation Ltd (GCGSCL) for supply of green fuel to greater Kolkata.

 GAIL had decided to set up 40 charged areas (CAs) but only 10 will be possible now. GAIL has called this a major deviation from the agreed position and sought a meeting to review the agreement. GAIL, in a letter written to the state on April 5, has sought an explanation and pointed out that viability of the project may be at stake due to this. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board may also impose a penalty, GAIL believes.
 
 Plans to supply CNG or CBM to greater Kolkata through GCGSCL was first mooted in 2011. When nothing happened till 2015, environment activist   moved an application in the National Green Tribunal (NGT). After the NGT’s intervention, the JVA was planned with 76% stake with GAIL. The green bench also directed the chief secretary to finalise the agreement and place the draft before the state cabinet. After the cabinet meeting on February 28, the state wrote to GAIL, informing that supply would only be allowed in a restricted area.
 
 “I think that the state is under some sort of pressure and doesn’t want green fuel to be used here. The cabinet has said that supply to other areas won’t be possible taking into account legal and technical aspects. I wonder who the experts are. This is nothing short of treachery with the people of the state and the environment,” Datta added.
