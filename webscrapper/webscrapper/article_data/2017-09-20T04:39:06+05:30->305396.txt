NEW DELHI:   ( ) on Monday gave an undertaking to the high court that it won’t disconnect power or water connection to luxury hotel Le   till the eviction proceedings was decided.

 NDMC’s undertaking came after the hotel challenged a public notice brought out by the council warning the hotel that it might face disconnection of supply if Rs 605 crore dues were not cleared, following termination of licence agreement. In another relief for the hotel, NDMC withdrew a paragraph from its notice warning the hotel to stop further bookings of guests.
