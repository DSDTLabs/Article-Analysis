Vadodara: The ambitious Smart City Transport Hub planned outside the railway station area will not consume a heritage building located near-by.

 The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is looking to retain the 150-year-old Damajirao Dharamshala behind Pathik Bhavan that was razed completely on Tuesday. 
 
 Heritage lovers in the city had been expressing concern about the fate of the dharamshala ever since the major razing drive kicked off in the railway station area in January. The structure is located behind the Pathik Bhavan whose razing ended on Tuesday morning.
 
 Much like the Pathik Bhavan, the Damajirao Dharamshala was in the possession of the Vadodara district panchayat. Both were recently transferred to the civic body for work on the transport hub. The dharamshala has constructed around 150 years back during the reign of Maharaja Ganpatrao Gaekwad and the existing structure was constructed by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III.
 
 The lodge is today in a rundown condition. “It will be restored and the design of the new structure will be such that the dharamshala can be put to some use as a heritage entrance from one side of the hub or as a lounge or for some other purpose,” said VMC commissioner Vinod Rao.
 
 According to sources, Maharaj Ganpatrao had constructed the building to facilitate the stay of officials working for the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway. Maharaja Khanderao had added some rooms and other facilities to it. After the work on railways got over, it was used by travellers.
 
 It was Sayajirao who constructed the present structure around 1875. Since the time of Maharaja Ganpatrao, the structure was named after Maharaja Damajirao Gaekwad. It is the only building in the city named after Damajirao.
 
 It has been built in the Indo-Saracenic style of architecture that was widely used during the reign of Sayajirao III. Damajirao had conquered the better part of Gujarat and brought it under the Gaekwadi rule.
