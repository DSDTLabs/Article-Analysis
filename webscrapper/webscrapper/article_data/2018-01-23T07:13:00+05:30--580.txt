Chandigarh: Punjab’s tableau on the Republic Day at Delhi has been themed around ‘Sangat and Pangat’, depicting the oneness of humanity with the spirit of communal harmony as preached by Sikh gurus.

 The tableau would showcase the humane traditions in which the ‘sangat’ (congregation of people) sits together transcending the boundaries of caste, creed, race, colour and religion in ‘pangat’ (a row). The tableau would also exhibit the way in which the free community kitchen called ‘langar’ is prepared wholly through the voluntary efforts of the people thus lending in their minds a feeling of supreme bliss regarding the entire process. The ‘Shabad’ (sermons) to be played at the backdrop of the tableau is recited by Padma Shri Bhai Nirmal Singh.
 
 The institution of langar was started by the first Sikh guru — Guru Nanak Dev. Third guru, Guru Amar Dass, continued the great tradition and made it a rule that nobody would be granted an audience until he/she contributes to langar. Even Mughal Emperor Akbar had to first partake of langar when he visited Guru Amar Dass. The institution of langar has been serving as a symbol of unity of mankind since last four centuries thus spreading the message of peace and communal harmony.
