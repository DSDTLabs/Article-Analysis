MUMBAI: Passengers boarding   out of Mumbai this weekend need not worry about delays, at least not on account of the navigation aid that has been switched off for over two weeks. 

 The new instrument   on runway 27 may start from Saturday, signalling an end to delays from May 17. 
 
 A notice to pilots and air traffic controllers had said the navigation aid on main runway 27 was to remain shut till June 5. A new navigation aid was being installed, and so in the interim, pilots of aircraft on approach to land have been relying on basic navigation aids.
