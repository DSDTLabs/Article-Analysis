CHARMINAR: Stashed in a garbage dump and away from prying eyes in  , an ancient cannon was discovered by children, who stumbled upon it on Thursday.

 The cannon was found next to a discarded car with garbage strewn around it near a fortified wall built by past rulers to provide security.
 
 Historians said it was used during wars to fire heavy projectiles. One of the residents told the authorities that there are a few more in the area and all of them need to be preserved in a museum.
 
 "The area is full of ancient monuments, tombs, war memorials and artillery. The officials do not take any interest in protecting them," said  , a resident.
 
 In March 2016, another cannon was found during a digging work to widen the   road near Charminar. "These are very interesting finds and the government should make sure they are well protected for future generations," said  , co-convener of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage.
 
 "We will verify but the cannons that are outside the limits of the museums are not under our maintenance," N R Visalatchy, director of the  , said.
