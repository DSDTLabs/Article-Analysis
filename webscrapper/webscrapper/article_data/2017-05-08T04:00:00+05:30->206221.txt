AHMEDABAD: No arbitrary re-adjustments of plots in   will be entertained from now nor will there be any deviation from draft TP schemes before plots are finalized by the state urban development department. This is the first time that the state’s   is tightening the noose around TP officers in  .

 “Usually most of the decisions are taken and finalized by the TPO. Except for compensation and contribution related issues in case of plots, none of the decisions of the TPO can be challenged. But now this will change,” said a senior   official. 
 
 The official pointed out that a lot of changes occur in the overall physical layout of the TP scheme at the finalization stage as a result of individual negotiations between the land owners and the TP officer.
 
 Another aspect that the state government is looking into is the arbitrariness with which the financial aspects are worked out regarding TP schemes. 
 
 “To begin with, the process of valuation that is followed is flawed. It is based on the jantri or the ready-reckoner for land and there is a substantial difference between the land values prescribed in the jantri and the prevalent market rates,” the UD official said. 
 
 “Some new laws will be in place where costs of the TP schemes that are estimated per sq m of development cost will be worked out. This will be a major change in two decades,” the UD official said.
