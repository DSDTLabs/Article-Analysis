After impressing fans with the teaser trailer of the   starrer sports drama ‘Guru’, the makers unveiled the first trailer at the film's audio launch, and it certainly looks promising. 

  
  
  The clip introduces us to Venkatesh's character of a grouchy and aged boxing coach  , who is passionate about the sport. He trains a young girl from the streets - played by Ritika Singh- who promises to be a protégée. Venkatesh is absolutely ruthless as he pushes Ritika to the breaking point in order to make her the very best in the sport. 
 
 'Guru', that is a Telugu remake of R  's ' ', sees Venkatesh playing the hot-headed boxing coach with ease. Leading lady   will be reprising her role in this remake. Much like the first film, she manages to hold her own opposite her leading man. 
 
 Directed by National Award winning filmmaker Sudha Kongara, 'Guru' hits theatres on April 7.
