NEW DELHI: Members of the   (DFC) and their families, who were evicted from their   at Safdarjung airport after their residences were sealed on April 18, moved the Delhi   seeking a direction to the   (AAI) to unseal their homes.

 HC is likely to hear the matter on Monday. The court had in March sought replies from the Centre and the AAI on the issue.
 
 The court issued notices to the authorities seeking their reply to the plea of the DFC, which was established in 1928, against the eviction notice issued by the AAI.
 
 The club had sought interim protection from the eviction till   is made functional. It submitted that since there is no appellate tribunal, therefore, it has moved the high court. To which the court posed a query to the club on whether it can give them the relief in the absence of the tribunal.
 
 Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, former Orissa chief minister Biju Patnaik and former air chief marshal and Padma Vibhushan awardee PC Lal were some of the alumni of the DFC.
 
 The club had submitted before the apex court that it had a licence for operation from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation till 2020 but the rent was enhanced by the AAI.
 
 The DFC challenged the February 2 order of Delhi HC in the apex court, in which it has been held that the AAI was clearly the competent authority to determine the amount of rent and collect any dues, and its decision to pursue recovery of dues is valid.
 
 HC had said that the DFC had a right to challenge the eviction order in the appropriate forum and had given four weeks to assail it.
