MUMBAI: An MBA graduate from   has taken to social media to narrate about increasing incidents of motorists being looted on JVLR by ' ' gangs. The latest theft occurred on Thursday night. 

 The incident took place when the MBA grad,   (27), was returning from Poonam Nagar towards her house in Oberoi Splendor, Jogeshwari. "It was 8.55pm and traffic was moving slow on JVLR. I was using my phone when my brother pointed out that I should be more careful as 'tak tak' gangs strike frequently on this stretch. I kept my phone inside my handbag and the next moment, I saw a man approach a white Corolla Altis standing next to us at the signal. Under the pretext of crossing the road, the pedestrian came in front of the Altis and pretended that he had been hit. Soon, another man popped up from and started banging on the car's window, hurling abuses at the motorist," Chaturvedi wrote on  .
 
 The frightened motorist, in his mid 40s, rolled down his car window a bit to see what was happening. "While one of the men kept yelling at him, his associate slid a hand inside the car, picked up the motorist's phone and ran away. The man, who pretended that he was hit, jumped on the divider and followed his associate. The motorist drove off not knowing that he had been looted. The episode unfolded 200m from a spot where two cops were stationed," Chaturvedi said. 
 
 On March 21, another motorist Ishaan Pancholi had taken to Facebook after his phone was stolen by a 'tak tak' gang member on JVLR. Another motorist had clicked a picture of the thief and it was handed over to the cops. "Pancholi's case occurred at the same spot. The gang strikes motorists headed towards  . As there is no U-turn, victims cannot chase the thieves who run across to the opposite side," said Chaturvedi.
