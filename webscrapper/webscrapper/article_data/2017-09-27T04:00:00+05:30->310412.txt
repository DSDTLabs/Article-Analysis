Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) has compelled a BJP councillor to close his two shops that he had been running illegally from the ground floor of his residential premises in Adajan area of the city for some time.

 Incidentally, the BJP councillor is chairman of the health committee of the municipal corporation and also of Ganesh Utsav Samiti. Anil Biscuitwala had opened both the shops in his bungalow without taking permission from competent authorities in the city. The building plan shows parking and puja room at the ground floor of the building where he had built the shops. 
 
 “The construction is in violation of the building plan. The bungalow owner did not take permission for opening the shops in residential premises,” an SMC officer of Rander zone said. 
 
 D M Patel, Rander zonal chief, said, “We have asked the house owner to submit proper documents to us. We won’t let anyone to run commercial establishments like these.” 
 
 Biscuitwala said, “I accept my mistake. I should have taken permission from municipal authorities before opening the shops in my bungalow. I have closed the shops and will soon approach the authorities concerned for permission to run the shops.”
