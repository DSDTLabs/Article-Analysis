Shilpa Mahna Bhatnagar, CEO & Co-founder at   talks about managing her work-life balance. 

  
 
 The way we prioritise things based on our needs and aspirations is the key to having a balance. Each one of us has a unique way to achieve work-life balance. For me, self-restraint is the key ingredient. During my personal time, if I have the urge to work, I put up a mental firewall which tells me to prioritise things and take action. 
 
  
 
 Being fit is a state of mind. There are days when I feel extremely fit as I am happy and in high spirits, and then there are days when even if everything is fine, I feel unfit.
 
  
 
 Dancing is close to my heart and gives me immense joy and energy for the entire day.
 
  
 
 I am an entrepreneur, hence, a risk taker. Life for an entrepreneur is full of choices which may or may not work. I strongly feel micro planners can never be successful as compared to entrepreneurs as they are averse to touching new and unknown boundaries. Entrepreneurs move ahead using their intelligence and gut. 
 
  
 
 Buddhism is close to my heart and acts like a spiritual ready reckoner. I do believe in the The Secret (Rhonda Byrneâ€™s book). 
 
  
 
 I handle success with celebrations and failure with a mug of beer.
 
  
 
 Patience and perseverance are key tools to manage a crisis. Each time, I have to handle a crisis, I tell myself to go with the flow, not to panic and make informed choices.
