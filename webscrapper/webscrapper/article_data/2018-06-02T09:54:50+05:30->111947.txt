KOCHI:   will soon launch ‘Calling Bell’, an initiative to help elderly people living alone in homes.

 Senior citizens, in case of emergency, can give a missed call to Snehitha, the gender help desk of Kudumbashree. The information will be later forwarded to   police and community counsellors for taking further action.
 
 The project also envisions social integration of senior citizens who lead an isolated life in their homes by connecting them with ‘Ayalkoottam’ groups under the Kudumbashree and gradually integrating them with the society by visiting and speaking to them once in three days.
 
 “The identification process of the potential beneficiaries is progressing and is expected to be completed within two weeks’ time. With the help of palliative agencies and Snehitha workers, houses of senior citizens living alone will be identified,” said   T M, district mission coordinator.
 
 The list will be compiled under each area development societies (ADS). Ayalkoottam health volunteers will be assigned with the care-taking of the beneficiaries identified in their ADS.
 
 “The initiative was following the news of a couple of deaths of elderly people due to unavailability of help in case of emergencies while living alone. Recently, a 65-year-old woman was robbed and killed in  . A growing number of senior citizens are living alone now, owing to their children being abroad or in a different city for their jobs and children’s education. The new initiative will cater to delivering emergency help to a large number of people,” said  , gender self-learning executive with Kudumbashree.
 
 A review meeting will be held once in two months under the district mission as well.
