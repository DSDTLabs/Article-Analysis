LUDHIANA: A woman set herself afire outside the office of a councillor, alleging his brother failed to get her money for her baby “sold” to a resident of  .

 The police said around 11am on Monday, the 28-year-old woman reached the office of councillor of ward number four Sarabjeet Singh Laadi. She poured kerosene on her body and set herself on fire. Cops said the councillor and a few residents came out of the office and doused the flames. She suffered burns and was rushed to the civil hospital, where doctors referred her to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, as her condition worsened. The councillor said while dousing the fire, he suffered injuries on the left arm and his beard also got burnt.
 
 “In 2014, she divorced her husband, with whom she had two children. After that she developed illicit relations with a man and gave birth to a boy about two months ago. As she didn’t want to keep the baby, she gave it to a mother of three daughters in our area about 10 days ago. Later, she said she wanted her son back. Last Wednesday, she approached   police, after which we got her Rs 2 lakh for the baby,” claimed the councillor.
 
 “A few days ago, she contacted my brother and asked for Rs 5 lakh for her baby, but he refused. She then started blackmailing us that she will commit suicide if we didn’t get her money,” he alleged.
 
 The councillor and his brother had acted as facilitators in giving the baby to the other family.
 
 The police have not registered a case, though the hospital found it to be a self-immolation bid.
 
 ADCP-IV   said they had sent two duty magistrates to the civil hospital in Ludhiana and Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, but they couldn’t record the statement as she was referred to PGI, Chandigarh. “We cannot say anything till she gives a statement,” he added.
 
 Police officials said the victim has suffered more than 90% burns and may not survive. They added that she may have been troubled by councillor’s brother, which is why she took the step.
