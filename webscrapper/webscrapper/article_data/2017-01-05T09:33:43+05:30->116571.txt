JAIPUR: Jagadguru Ramanandacharya Rajasthan   has indefinitely postponed the   slated for the post of two   for `sankya yoga' on January 6 on Wednesday .

 The move came after TOI carried a news article titled 'Sanskrit university 'bends' norms to recruit teachers' on January 4 edition, highlighting how   norms were violated in the recruitment process. It is learnt that the governor took the report into cognisance and directed the registrar of the university to stall the interview and syndicate meeting until next orders were issued.
 
 The university has now issued an order stating that the syndicate meeting scheduled to be held on January 6 has been cancelled. However, the order did not state that the agenda for the syndicate meeting was to approve the selection of candidates for the post on the same day . Sources confirmed that the university has called all 44 selected candidates for the interview about the postponement.
 
 “The governor has questioned the vice-chancellor and the registrar on the way they initiated the recruitment process without meeting the UGC guidelines,“ said a source. The university had invited applications without following the National Eligibility Test (NET) criterion which is compulsory under UGC rules.   was added to the list for NET by UGC in April 2016.
 
 As per UGC norms, a can didate, besides securing 55% marks in the master's exams, should also have cleared NET conducted by the UGC.
 
 The university had selected 44 candidates for the final round of interviews. “Many of these selected candidates were not PhD holders nor NET qualified,“ said a source. TOI called up vice-chancellor Vinod Shastri and asked him the reasons for postponing the meeting, but he told us to “speak to the registrar“.
