NEW DELHI: The finance ministry has reopened the case for restructuring of  , including a possible sale of government stake to private players, as it seeks to stop a further burden on the exchequer and use the money for other social security schemes. The government, which holds 78% in the bank, had put its plan to pare stake in the erstwhile financial institution on hold amid reluctance within the finance ministry to reduce the Centre’s holding as officials feared that they may be hounded by investigative and audit agencies in future. 

 
 To compound the problem, the mounting losses in the state-run banking sector derailed the proposal to model   Bank on the lines of   where the government is a small shareholder with the shares held by the Specified Undertaking of UTI, or SUUTI.
 
  
  
 
 Sources said that the government has once again started looking at all options related to IDBI Bank, although they did not indicate a time frame, given the political constraints due to next year’s general elections. The sources said that the plan was to move ahead with IDBI’s restructuring, but the fraud at   came as a setback and resulted in the government’s energy being diverted to address the immediate problem.
 
 At the same time, they realised that the Centre was going ahead with disinvestment of Air India, the national carrier and another cash-guzzling public sector player.
 
 Meanwhile, the new management at IDBI Bank — led by MD and CEO M K Jain — has started getting rid of non-core assets, including real estate, to raise funds. This is expected to partly allay fears some officials had as they saw massive real estate holdings in south Mumbai and other upmarket localities as an area of concern while valuing the state-owned lender. 
 
 Sources said that the government is not in a position to keep pumping resources into public sector lenders as the same money can be deployed elsewhere, given the huge requirement to fund crucial sectors such as health and education.
