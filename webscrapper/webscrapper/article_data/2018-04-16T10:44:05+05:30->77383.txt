CHANDIGARH: The policy of garbage  , which was introduced with much fanfare, has not been implemented properly, said residents of ward number 22.

 Residents of the ward, which covers sectors 31, 47 and 48, on Sunday, complained that door-to-door   collectors are not segregating garbage and residents are doing it at source level. 
 
 But since garbage collectors have discontinued the practice of   segregation, residents are also following suit, they said, expressing concern over issues of cleanliness. 
 
 “Cleanliness is a big issue in Sector 47. Dustbins put up near parks have been uprooted, although we don’t know why. I think they dustbins were never emptied and were overflowing, which is probably why people uprooted them,” said A K  , a resident of Sector 47C.
 
 The mayor conceded to the problem. “Jaypee Plant is not working currently and the MC is processing waste on its own. Waste needs to be segregated into dry and wet waste. As of now, only 17% of the waste collected is segregated. We need more active public participation for efficient disposal and processing,” he said. 
 
 Residents asked why they should pay extra when the waste is not being segregated. Another resident of Sector 48, S   said, “After the waste segregation drive, charges of garbage collection were increased. But garbage disposal is still the same. Even though garbage is segregated at source level now, we don’t see the garbage collector segregating waste further. Garbage is being dumped as per the earlier practice and garbage segregation is not happening.”
