NEW YORK: Children who are two to three inches shorter than average for their age are at an increased risk of suffering a stroke in adulthood, a major Danish study warns.

 The research, published in the journal ‘Stroke’, examined data of more than 3,00,000 Danish schoolchildren born between 1930-1989.
 
 Scientists noted that boys and girls who were two to three inches shorter than average for their age were at increased risk of clot-related (ischemic) stroke when they reached adulthood, with men also at higher risk of a bleeding stroke. “Our study suggests that short height in children is a possible marker of stroke risk,” said   from the   at   and   in the US. “These children should pay extra attention to changing or treating modifiable risk factors for stroke throughout life...,” said Baker.
 
 While adult height is genetically determined, it is also influenced by maternal diet during pregnancy, childhood diet and stress. PTI
