Kolkata: A septuagenarian woman was found guarding the corpse of her husband inside her flat at Haridevpur on Saturday. Police suspect the man, Amar Kumar Sanyal (82), had died at least three days ago.

 Sanyals’ neighbours on Saturday informed cops about a stench coming from the first floor flat of an apartment. When cops broke open the door, they found Hasi Rani sitting with her husband’s body. 
 
 “She was in a sari and had smeared vermilion on her forehead. She started complaining to the corpse saying that her meditation was being disturbed,” said Kalpana Banerjee, a neighbour. She was sent to mental home on Sunday.
