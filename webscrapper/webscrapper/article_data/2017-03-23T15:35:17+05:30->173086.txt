Actress   says she might perform at  's Purpose World Tour here in May but nothing has been finalised so far. 

 The Grammy Award winning global pop sensation is slated to perform here in his maiden concert on May 10. There were reports that Sonakshi may join him too. On the speculations, the actress said, "Filaal toh bas baat chidi hai (right now there has only been some talk). Nothing has been finalised yet. But if something like this happens, then I'll be very happy because it will be a great platform and I really like his music. But when it gets finalised, I will let you all know," she said. 
 
  
  
 The actress was talking to reporters at the launch of '  2.0' song from her upcoming film ' '. The track, composed by Amaal Malik, is a recreated version of the iconic yesteryear song - 'Gulabi aankhein...'. 
 
 Sonakshi feels there is nothing wrong in remixing the popular retro songs as they appeal to a generation who may not have heard the original. "The older generation would definitely have a very special connection to the old songs but people from our generation, younger than us, kids of this generation have not heard the songs," she said. 
 
 "All we are doing is repackaging them and giving it to them in a way they understand and like. I think it's a great idea. I have thoroughly enjoyed all the remixes of classic songs that we have had in the last 1-2 years," she said. 
 
 Directed by Sunhil Sippy, 'Noor' is based on Pakistani author Saba Imtiaz's novel 'Karachi, You're Killing Me!'.
