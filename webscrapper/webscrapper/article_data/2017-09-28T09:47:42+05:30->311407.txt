MUMBAI: The   management, under the direct authority of the Supreme Court-appointed   ( ) is busy making big plans to revamp the National Cricket Academy and will soon approach a leading headhunter to appoint a new project head for the same.

 In February this year, the CoA had completed all formalities with regards to the payment for the 25-acre land in   in Bengaluru ­ a plot in the defence and the aerospace park ­ following which BCCI CEO   was given the charge to look at introducing a new structure. While Johri goes about his job, beginning with a meeting of the existing NCA staff in Bengaluru on Thursday , the Indian team management ­ more importantly the cricketers ­ have their own wishlist the BCCI should have in the new academy .
 
 Sharing views with TOI, the team management said it hopes BCCI will study and take into account the international standards for sports academies before putting the required expertise at the NCA. “It has to create a new benchmark. Centres of excellence around the world always raise the bar and given where Indian cricket stands, BCCI needs to do the same. We can start by first beginning to understand how various sports across the globe function at the highest level,”sources told TOI.
