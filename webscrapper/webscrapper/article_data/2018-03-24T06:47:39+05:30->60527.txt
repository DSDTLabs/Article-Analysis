KOCHI: It was expected that about 1,000 private buses operating in the city will complete installing GPS/GPRSbased bus tracking system by April first week, but both operators and Kochi   Rail Ltd (KMRL) fear that they will miss the deadline.

 With private bus operators saying that it would take them considerable time to complete installing the system in all buses, Metro officials associated with the project insist on speeding up the process.
 
 “Dissemination of information through live tracking of buses, including destination, route number, expected time of arrival, journey status (on time/late) will attract more people to use the public transportation network. If we want to promote public transport system in the city, these activities have to be completed on a war-footing,” said a KMRL official.
 
 The   ( ) had signed agreements with seven private bus operating companies for providing an ‘informed transit’ application through Kochi 1 App, using GPS/GPRS-based bus tracking system and on-board passenger information system.
 
 In fact, KMRL has facilitated in signing of agreements between UMTC and bus operators.
 
 According to KMRL. this initiative is based on the state government’s vision to ‘move people and not personalized vehicles’ and aims to promote and maximize travel through public transportation modes, to reduce congestion on roads, air pollution and accidents.
 
 “There has been some delay in completing installation of GPS in the buses. We are in constant touch with KMRL. All the seven bus companies will have to take the same interest. Around 500 government buses have to install the GPS system,” said  , president of Kochi Metropolitan Transport Cooperative Society (KMTCS).
 
 
 The model adopted here in Kochi is that the seven bus companies would pay Rs 5 per bus daily to UMTC as service charge. The bus operators can recover the expenditure if they could get one additional passenger on bus in a day.
