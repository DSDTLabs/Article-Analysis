CHENNAI: In a reprieve to actor  , the   on Thursday stayed all further proceedings in a defamation case initiated against him by a film   before a magistrate court in the city.

 Justice N Sathiskumar granted the interim relief on a petition filed by Rajinikanth. The injunction would be in operation till June 25. The issue pertains to a private complaint moved by financier  , seeking defamation proceedings against the actor. Bothra claimed that   Kasthuri Raja, the father-in-law of Rajinikanth’s daughter, had obtained a loan of Rs 40 lakh from him on January 2, 2012 for interest.
 
 Raja later approached him on July 13, 2012, for a further loan of Rs 25 lakh for which Bothra demanded surety. Bothra said Raja wrote a letter on the same day stating that even if he failed to pay the loan, Rajinikanth would repay it. As Raja failed to pay back the loan, the financier moved a criminal case against him which was eventually dismissed.
 
 Subsequently, based on the alleged letter, the financier moved a city civil court against Rajinikanth to recover the loan. The   filed an application claiming that the suit had been moved to “extort money” from him. Claiming that Rajinikanth’s allegation had brought him disrepute, the financier moved a private defamation complaint which was taken cognizance of by the magistrate which in turn ordered summons to the actor.
