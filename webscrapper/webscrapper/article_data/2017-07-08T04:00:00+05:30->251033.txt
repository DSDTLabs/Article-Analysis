Vadodara: It was in 2013 that a long drawn legal battle for the properties worth thousands of crores owned by the royal Gaekwad family was settled. The properties were divided between the families of Samarjitsinh Gaekwad, his uncle Pratapsinh Gaekwad and their sisters. The settlement had paved the way for the families to develop their properties. 

 However, the legal suit filed by distant cousins of Samarjitsinh, has again brought focus back on the properties. The descendants of Govindrao Gaekwad I, who was great grandfather of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, have claimed that the property that was divided between Samarjitsinh and Sangramsinh is ancestral property and sought share in it. 
 
 The legal suit may put spanner in the projects that the Gaekwads have undertaken after the division of property. “The petitioners tried to blackmail us and sought crores of rupees. When I didn’t agree, they filed this case. It is also an attempt to drive away people who may be interested in developing our properties,” Samarjitsinh said.
 
 “Our properties were divided four years ago with every family member’s consent. Why did the petitioners file the case now? Their petition has no legal standing as they were earlier evicted from our land by a court order. They don’t have any share in the family property,” said Samarjitsinh. After the division in 2013, the royal Gaekwads have taken up several commercial projects on their properties.
 
 While a deal for a big commercial complex in Nazarbaug compound was done by Sangramsinh, Samarjitsinh too is planning to convert the grand Laxmi Vilas Palace into a resort. Apart from the palaces and buildings, the royal property also includes precious diamonds, vintage cars, gold and silver jewellery, paintings.
