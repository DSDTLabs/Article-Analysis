GURGAON: Civic agencies in Gurgaon have initiated some measures to arrest the rising   levels in the city but they still have a long way to go to in cleaning up the air, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) officials observed on Friday. 

 Following a prod from the Supreme Court earlier this week, CPCB teams carried out inspections across the city on Wednesday and Thursday, analysing compliance of anti-pollution norms by civic authorities and   (HSPCB). After the two-day-long recce, CPCB officials claimed that government agencies seemed to have implemented some steps such as vacuum cleaning roads and fining contractors/agencies violating pollution norms at construction sites. However, a lot more has still not been done to ensure a tangible change, they maintained.
 
 “So far, we have noticed that polluting industries, construction firms and brick kilns have been penalised in a big way. Also, mechanised vacuum cleaners have been introduced by Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon (MCG). Still, the road ahead is quite long. For instance,   to settle down dust have not been installed, civic bodies have not been able to completely ban waste burning in and around the city,” a senior official at CPCB told TOI, requesting anonymity.
 
 The official also expressed concerns over waste management. “We visited   waste treatment plant. It is in bad shape… waste hasn’t been treated for the last three years. Garbage from the city is being simply dumped there every day. There is a need to convert waste into energy at the plant to minimise health hazards,” he added.
