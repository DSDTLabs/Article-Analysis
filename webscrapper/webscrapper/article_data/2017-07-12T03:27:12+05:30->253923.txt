Navi Mumbai: A   man,   (23), was detained by the Navi Mumbai cyber crime branch on Tuesday after a   retailer from Rabale complained about an hacker having gained unauthorised access to an app provided by the mobile service provider. The suspect, a resident of Sujangarh in Churu district, is a master of computer application student.

 The complainant said that the hacker duplicated the data. The breach came to light on Monday after a website magica.pk put up Jio consumer details like names, e-mails, mobile numbers, dates of SIM card activation and circle it was activated in. Enforcement agencies have suspended the site.
 
 An official said, “The retailer has been authorized by the company to lodge a complaint. Every Jio retailer has been given with an app that can be accessed using an user ID and password. When the retailer recharges a SIM card, s/he gets access to some data. This data can doesn’t include details of Aadhar, PAN nor addresses.”
 
 “This is not theft but unauthorized access. The hacker has not downloaded the data from the retailer’s computer nor saved it in a cloud,” the official added.
