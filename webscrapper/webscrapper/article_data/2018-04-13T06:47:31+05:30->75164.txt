LUCKNOW: Prime minister  's pitch for yoga is being given a further push in UP. The   government has roped in  's yoga guru HR Nagendra to promote yoga as an evidence-based science. For this, he would help the department of AYUSH start department of naturopathy and yoga at 18 divisional headquarters. 

 Nagendra, a recipient of Padma Shri award, was in the city on Thursday with his team to finalise the blueprint. 
 
 "These departments that would come up at medical colleges and AYUSH hospitals, would work to reduce the burden of diabetes and oral, breast and cervical cancers," he said. 
 
 Secretary, AYUSH, Mukesh Meshram, said that the centers would be coming up under   government's plan to promote and popularise yoga in urban and rural areas of the state. 
 
 
 
 
 These Centers would be creating awareness, screening and investigating people diseases and train workforce to make intervention and will undertake research to prove the power of yoga,” he said. Nagendra and associates launched ‘Niyantrit Madhumeh Bharat’ programme to study trends of diabetes. Of the 60 districts covered in the project, six were from UP.
