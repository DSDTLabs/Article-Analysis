Margao: Goans For Dabolim Only (GFDO) on Saturday challenged Union aviation minister Suresh Prabhu to a debate as to whether the proposed   Greenfield airport is beneficial for the state.

 Convenor Fr Eremito Rebelo said that GFDO will write to President Ram Nath Kovind, urging him to direct the aviation minister to focus on promoting state-run entities rather than making inexplicable statements which promote the business and share prices of private airports.
