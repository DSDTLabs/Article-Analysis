 Talking to TOI amid sobs, Rajesh Sharma said he was told by the school that his son had met with an accident.
 
 His wife Reena, still in shock, stands numb beside him.
 
 “I got a call around 10am on Tuesday. A school official told me that my son had met with an accident in school and had been admitted to KGMU trauma centre. I was numb for a few moments initially. I rushed to the hospital with my wife,” said Rajesh, stammering.
 
 “When I reached the hospital, I saw that my son was in a critical condition. He was not in a condition to talk. That was the most difficult time. I had no idea what had happened to him. On Wednesday, when he woke up, he narrated the sequence of events of how he was attacked by a senior girl, whom he addressed as ‘didi’, in the school,” recalled Rajesh.
 
 The parents were slightly relieved on Wednesday morning when they saw some improvement in their son’s condition.
 
 “We sat up all night beside him without drinking a drop of water,” said his mother Reena.
 
 The Sharmas, however, said they have a firm belief in the school administration to give justice to them.
 
 “My older son, Hitesh, is a student of Class VI in the same school. He has been unwell for a few days and is not attending school,” said Rajesh.
 
 Hrithik has been a student in the school from nursery but never complained about bullying in the past.
 
 Rajesh is a class-IV employee in the high court while Reena is a homemaker.
