DISPUR: Chief minister   launched the Pradhan Mantri   Yojana (PMUY) scheme at Golokganj in Dhubri on Saturday. 

 The programme will enable many rural women of the district to get access to free LPG connections. PMUY is a pet programme of Prime Minister   for the development of rural women below the poverty line. Sonowal said, "Women in rural underprivileged households have to invest a lot of time and energy in finding firewood for their daily cooking and have to suffer because of the smoke emanating from the fire. All this will change for the better as Ujjwala will provide free LPG connections to all these women. LPG penetration, at 28% in Dhubri, will see a quantum leap to 80%."
