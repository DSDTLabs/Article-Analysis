JAIPUR: While the ATMs across the nation are still running dry, one malfunctioning ATM in   on Tuesday dispensed notes of Rs 2,000 in place of Rs 100. Around   until bank officials closed the ATM room.

 The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon when one Jitesh Diwakar reached a   near collector circle in Tonk district and typed Rs 3,500 but the machine dispensed Rs 70,000.
 
 Before Diwakar could complained bank officials about the glitch, other people got the wind of malfunction and withdrew extra cash. According to Harishankar Meena, branch's chief manager, the malfunction was caused due to the mistake of agency responsible for putting the cash into ATM box.
 
 “A cash machine has multiple drawers for different currency notes. The operators made a mistake and placed notes of Rs 2,000 on the cash drawer reserved for notes of Rs 100. This led to a mas sive malfunction and a person withdrawing Rs 100 got Rs 2,000,“ Meena told TOI over phone.
 
 He added that the cash machine was recently recalibrated to accommodate new currency notes of Rs 2,000.“Around nine people took away extra cash, by the time we could close the cash machine, Rs 6 lakhs were already dispensed,“ Meena told TOI.
 
 Soon the news of the malfunction spread across the town like a wildfire and score of people lined up outside the ATM to reap the benefits of a glitch. But Diwaker informed the bank about the technical error and security guards closed the shutters of the ATM room, leaving many people disappointed.
 
 The bank officials are now planning to trace down the people who made away with extra cash. “We have gone through the list of people who withdrew extra cash. We are contacting their respective banks and we would take back the cash,“ Meena added.
 
 However, a few people on Wednesday reached the bank's branch and deposited the extra cash.
