PATIALA: A   on Friday allowed an application moved by the defence counsel of Jagtar Singh Tara, accused in Rashtriya Sikh Sangat chief  , seeking a ‘privilege meeting’ with his client inside the  , Chandigarh.

 Tara’s counsel Brijinder Singh Sodhi moved the application in which he contended that as per the jail manual, a lawyer could meet his client inside the jail ‘within sight, but out of hearing’ to ensure their privacy under elaborate security arrangement.
 
 Allowing the application, the court ordered the jail authorities to make arrangements for the same and even imposed restrictions on videography of the meeting.
 
 Tara, one of the accused in the former Punjab chief minister Beant Singh’s assassination case, was arrested from Thailand in January 2015 and is currently lodged in Burail Jail, Chandigarh. He is also facing charges of murdering Rulda Singh, head of Rashtriya Sikh Sangat, an affiliate of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), who had been gunned down by assailants outside his house in 2009 in Patiala.
 
 Sodhi said in all probability he would be meeting his client in the Burail jail on Saturday after which he would even challenge Section 268 of the CrPC imposed on Tara under which he was not allowed to be taken out of the jail premises and produced before the courts only through video conferencing. He said Tara was facing health issues and had severe pain in his spinal cord.
 
 Sodhi said even as a board of doctors has suggested that he should undergo an MRI scan at a government hospital, the jail authorities were not taking him for the scan citing Section 268 of CrPC.
 
 “The section is imposed in regard with the court hearings, but was being misinterpreted by the jail staff. In case an inmate suffers a heart attack, won’t he be taken to hospital for immediate treatment,” he contended.
