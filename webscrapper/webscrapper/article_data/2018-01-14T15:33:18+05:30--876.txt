It looks like sit-coms are the flavour of the season on Malayalam TV these days, as programmes such as Uppum Mulakum and Marimayam has been garnering the attention of the audience. The latest episode of Marimayam deals with yet another contemporary subject that has been making waves in the society. 

 According to the promo that was shared on its social media page, the episode, that will go on air on   at 8 pm on Sunday, deals with the online feud that happened between actress Parvathy and   fans. 
 
 It is said that being able to laugh at oneself is the best thing that a human should do. The actors of Marimayam mock both parties equally, and characters resembling the people concerned gain centre-stage.
 
 Here, the actress in question is named Mandu and one is left wondering if that implies a regressive name to be associating the actress with. The actor is Shyamalan, and the fans decide how to pull down the actress. And as she gets trolled in umpteen ways on social media, the fans divulge as to how they have handed over the laptops to ten random people, who have been asked to sit at home and send abusive messages.
