JODHPUR : In a major development in the field of genetic research in  , the   of Jodhpur has signed an MoU with the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology of CSIR, New Delhi. Both the institutions will begin a collaborative research in Pediatric Urologic disorders and Pediatric Neurology & Neurogenetics.

 Terming it to be first of its kind and a new chapter in genetic research, principal of the   college   said that the research would pave the way for identification of the genes causing congenital diseases of various types and then prevent those diseases from occurring.
 
 He further said that based on the studies, the affected families with gene anomaly would be provided counselling so that genetic diseases could be controlled or at the best avoided.
 
 Under this MoU, the faculties and staff sharing between the two institutions as well as research facilities and technologies will lead to an intensive study on the cases with genetic disorders and collection of data thereof.
 
 Describing the importance of this MoU, professor of the Pediatric Nurology, Manish Parakh said that as far as the gene based congenital diseases are concerned, they could not be treated unless the gene, causing the disease, was identified and treated.
 
 “Thus, this MoU, would help in an intensive research by studying the cases in the field, map their genetic history and prepare a data”, he said adding that this would help in identifying the gene, treat it and prevent the disease caused by it.
 
 Bhat said that this was just a beginning where a laboratory would be set up for testing of the samples to identify the genes and proceeding further to develop Jodhpur as a regional center for genetic studies.
 
 “Through this collaboration, we look forward to extend treatment to 90% children with genetic anomaly, which include both neurological and urological disorders. By doing so, we would be able to contain the maximum diseases in their families”, Bhat said.
