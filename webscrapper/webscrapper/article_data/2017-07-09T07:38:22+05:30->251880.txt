PUNE: City-based builder  , who blew the lid off  , has said that the state government must not reinstate   as a cabinet minister going by the findings of   but must wait for completion of probe by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB).

 “Till date, I had not commented on the Zoting committee. There are talks that the committee has not recommended criminal action against Khadse and hence he can be back in cabinet. This would be wrong on the part of the government as ACB has registered a first information report gainst Khadse, including his wife and son-in-law, in connection with a 3.1-acre MIDC land,” said Gavande.
 
 Early this year, the Bombay High Court directed ACB to investigate a complaint filed by Gawande at Bund Garden Police Station on May 30, 2016, for a probe into the Bhosari MIDC land deal. 
 
 Gawande had moved court after police did not act on his complaint. 
 
 The ACB then annexed his complaint letter with the FIR for offences punishable under sections 13 (1) (d), 13 (2) and 15 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which deal with criminal misconduct by a public servant for obtaining pecuniary gains for him or any other person, and Section 109 of the Indian Penal Code (abetment). 
 
 “The Zoting committee is not a higher authority than the high court concerned. I would like to have a copy of the report as I had lodged a complaint in connection with the case,” said Gavande.
