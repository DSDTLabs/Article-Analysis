Vellore: A second-year mechanical engineering student of a campus in Katpadi committed suicide inside a common bathroom in the hostel in the early hours of Thursday. 

 Nallam Sathya Basker Santhosh, 20, son of N V Rama Rao, a native of Jamshedpur in Jharkhand, was found dead with his head in a polythene bag sealed with adhesive tape. 
 
 Police recovered from his laptop a suicide note addressed to his parents. 
 
 “The note said the student was not able to meet the expectations of his parents,” Vellore superintendent of police P Pakalavan said. 
 
 Santhosh shared a room with three other students. “He went to the bathroom around 3.30am on Thursday. When he did not return after half an hour, his roommates became suspicious and knocked on the bathroom door. Since there was no response they called the hostel warden who broke open the door and found him dead,” said a police officer.
 
 “Forensic experts inspected the crime scene and confirmed it as a case of suicide,” the SP added.
 
 Police shifted the body to Government Vellore Medical College Hospital for postmortem. 
 
 They filed a case under Section 174 of CrPC and started an inquiry.
