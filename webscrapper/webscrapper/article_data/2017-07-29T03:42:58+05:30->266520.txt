MUMBAI: The day TOI reported about Shiv   man Sunil   being under the scanner for his Powai lounge, the BMC swung into action and   an illegal structure erected by him in Ghatkopar to allegedly encroach an open space. 

 Shitap, who owns several disputed properties, was arrested after the ground-plus-four-storey   in Ghatkopar collapsed on Tuesday, killing 17 persons. Resident of the building alleged that Shitap had carried out illegal repairs on the ground floor, causing the disaster.
 
 On Friday, officials from N ward pulled down the illegal structure in Altaf Nagar on Andheri-Ghatkopar Link Road. Though the BMC claimed that the demolished structure, which looked like a shanty from outside, was 1,200 sq ft, when TOI visited the site, it did not seem to be more than 3,000 square feet. Shitap had rented out the structure to a local mandal as well to a caterer, who specialises in making biryanis for parties and marriages. Surprisingly, the BMC had provided a water connection at the site, which has now been disconnected.
 
 BMC officials said that the electricity bill was in Shitap’s name. “The encroached plot was part of a BMC road,” said a civic official.
 
 Sources said that Shitap had allegedly brought two or three nearby slums and then encroached upon the open land adjoining them. “Like he did in Powai for Rumours lounge, Shitap here too encroached and then sublet it to someone else. When the BMC served him a notice and tried to demolish the structure in 2010, Shitap managed to get a stay from the city civil court. Shitap reportedly planned to build a hotel or pub as this property was bang on the main road,” said a source.
 
 Bhagyashree Kapse, assistant municipal commissioner, N ward, said that the court lifted the stay on July 12. The structure has been in existence prior to 2010. “As the stay was lifted, BMC officials, along with the police personnel, demolished the structure on Friday,” said an official.
