Tirupur: Scores of Aadhar cards meant to be distributed to the public were found dumped in garbage mound near a canal in the city on Monday. Revenue officials have seized the Aadhar cards and launched an inquiry. The postal department meanwhile has assured an inquiry since the cards were supposed to be delivered to the cardholders through the department. According to residents of Alagumalai near Pongalur in Tirupur, a few children were playing with ‘papers’ from a sack dumped in the garbage mound along the irrigation canal. When passers-by spotted the papers, they found those were Aadhar cards bearing identity of people living in Samundipuram, Gandhinagar and Siluvapatti. They informed the local revenue officials who in turn alerted tahsildar Gopalakrishnan. He recovered all the cards and took them to the taluk office. The officials also found there were several other letters of communication dumped along with the cards at the place. Residents alleged that it must be the handiwork of postmen who would have dumped the cards to avoid the duty of distributing them to so many addresses.TNN
