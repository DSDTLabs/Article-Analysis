LUCKNOW:   in   would be mitigated to some extent with a new sub-station in sector-5. The   will improve supply and rid the area of   and voltage fluctuation.

 The colony has only two   against the sanctioned eight. Residents complain of long and frequent power cuts and voltage fluctuation. The two 20MVA sub-stations have not been able to cater to the increasing number of consumers in the area. 
 
 “A new one will be made functional soon,” said executive engineer Vrindavan Colony NK Mishra. The colony also has an under-developed power distribution infrastructure, for example lesser number of transformers and long distribution lines.
 
 Another 20MVA sub-station has been proposed in sector-D1 of LDA Colony on Kanpur Road. Land has been provided by LDA to Lucknow Electricity Supply Administration for the new facility.
 
 The colony gets 8% to 10% enhancement in load every month, leading to voltage fluctuations.
