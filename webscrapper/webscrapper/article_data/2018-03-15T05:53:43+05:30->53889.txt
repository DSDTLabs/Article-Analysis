CHANDIGARH: BJP's   candidate from Haryana,   (retd), is facing charges of cheating in the multiple plot allotment scam in the state. Vats was allotted a plot in the   ( ) developed sector in   under the defence quota and later got another plot in Gurugram from state government's discretionary quota. 

 The rules state that a person can't be allotted more than one plot under any category. The multiple plot allotment scam had surfaced in 2013, when the Punjab and   high court found out that a large number of defence personnel in Haryana had got more than one plot by concealing allotments. 
 
 Lt Gen D P Vats told TOI that his case does not fall within the definition of the multiple allotments because there was no such policy when the first plot was allotted in 1979.
 
 Cancel nomination of Vats: Congress leader
 
 An investigation had found that the defence personnel had got anywhere between two and 25 plots by giving false affidavits.
 
 Vats filed his nomination for the Rajya Sabha on Monday. On Tuesday, Congress leader and Palwal MLA Karan Singh Dalal approached the returning officer with a complaint about the pending criminal case against Vats. Dalal demanded that Vatsâ€™s nomination be cancelled for not disclosing details of the FIR against him in his affidavit.
 
 Documents accessed by TOI show that Vats was allotted the first plot (number 4,274) under the defence quota on February 19, 1979, in Sector 11 of Jind. He was allotted another plot (number 2,928) under the discretionary quota in Sector 46 of Gurgaon on April 22, 1996.
 
 Investigations had revealed that Vats was booked (FIR no. 1,038) on October 30, 2015, in Gurgaon for cheating on a complaint by HUDA authorities. Criminal proceedings against him are pending.
