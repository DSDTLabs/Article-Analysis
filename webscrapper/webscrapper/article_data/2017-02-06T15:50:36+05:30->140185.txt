CHENNAI: A day after   general secretary V K Sasikala was elected as legislature party leader, paving way for her to be the chief minister, former Union finance minister and senior Congress leader P   on Monday said people in   and the AIADMK are moving in opposite directions. 

 “It is the right of the AIADMK MLAs to elect their leader. It is the right of the people to ask if the leader deserves to be the Tamil Nadu chief minister,” Chidambaram tweeted.
 
 “Looking back with pride, Tamil Nadu chief minister’s chair was occupied by K Kamaraj and C N Annadurai,” tweeted Chidambaram.
 
 RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy said he had never seen a person so hated within and outside the party becoming the chief minister. 
 
 “Sasikala, the new CM. No celebrations. No crackers. No cheer. Eerie silence. Never seen a person so hated within and outside the party becoming CM,” Gurumurthy tweeted.
