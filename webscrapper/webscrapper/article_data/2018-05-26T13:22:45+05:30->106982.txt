SHIMLA: The   government has sent a proposal to the central government for establishing a Rs 4,751-crore rainwater-harvesting project in the state, said chief minister Jai Ram   here on Friday.

 
 Thankur, who was presiding over a review meeting of the state irrigation and public health department, added that the state also sent a Rs 798-crore for central funding for remodeling and augmentation of 1,421 water-supply schemes in the state, to ensure adequate supply to people. Thakur said rainwater flows downstream in the hill state goes to waste in the absence of structures for water conservation. “We can use this same water for irrigation and other purposes in days of scarcity with the help of such conservation structures,” he said.
 
 The CM added that it was the state government’s responsibility to ensure water is not scarce in case of droughtlike conditions. “Special steps will be taken to check leakages in pipelines. Tourist season is at its peak and efforts should be made to ensure there is no inconvenience to visitors.
 
 Arrangements will be made in advance to meet any eventuality due to the prolonged dry spell,” he said. “No snowfall in winter adversely affected water sources of the state. Efforts will be made for adopting alternative arrangements in area with water scarcity. We will install handpumps in dry areas.” He said services of tankers should be pressed into service for supply of water.
