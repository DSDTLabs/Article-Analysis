HYDERABAD:   chief minister   has directed officials to link Aadhaar numbers with pattadar passbooks, to be distributed to farmers as part of Land Records Updation Programme (LRUP). Farmers who do not come forward to link their Aadhaar with passbooks, their land would be treated as   land, he said. 

 "It has come to my notice that some people in Medchal, Ranga Reddy and other districts have not linked their Aadhaar with land records. They should give their Aadhaar details at the earliest. Lands that are not linked with Aadhaar number will be treated as Benami properties," CM said.
 
  The state government is planning to give input subsidy to farmers from the next financial year. The passbooks will be used for taking loans from banks. KCR reviewed distribution of passbooks with revenue officials at   on Friday. He asked officials to issue pattadar passbooks to farmers holding government-assigned lands along with patta land owners. He instructed officials to identify assignees and their rights before issuing passbooks.
 
 The state government is planning to issue passbooks to farmers from March 11 this year, but the process is likely to be delayed further. 
 
 "The passbooks should be made on the names of the owners. Every entry in the passbooks should be scrutinized thoroughly and there shall not be any mistake or error in the entries. While doing so, there should not be any undue haste," the chief minister said. 
 
 KCR said if a farmer holds non-agriculture land in the village, those details also should be made as an entry into the passbooks and an additional column should be provided for this purpose.
