PATNA: The   and MLCs appear to have shed their heartburns and past complaints against CM  , as they are ‘nearly decided’ to attend the ‘bhoj’ (feast) that the CM is scheduled to host on Monday.
 
  Though the   has not yet taken any formal decision on attending the feast at 1, Anne Marg, the overwhelming mood in the state legislature party seems to be that its MLAs and MLCs should attend the “bhoj”. “Nitish is not just JD(U) national president, but also the   CM. The PM and CM are above party lines in such matters. The BJP lawmakers would attend the feast hosted by the CM,” said state BJP chief spokesman and MLC Vinod Narayan Jha.
  
  Incidentally, after the formation of the JD(U)-BJP government in the state in November 2005, CM Nitish used to host a feast after the end of the budget session. Similarly, the Speaker of the state assembly also used to organize feasts for the lawmakers after the budget session. However, Nitish discontinued with the tradition after the fall of the   government in June 2013.
  
  To further complicate the matters, back in June 2010, CM Nitish had cancelled the feast he had announced for the senior national BJP functionaries, including L K Advani, who were participating in the party’s two-day national executive meet. Later, it continued to haunt and sour the BJP-JD(U) relations to the bitter level after the two parties parted ways in 2013.
  
  As for today, the BJP is the main opposition party, unleashing vitriolic criticism against CM and the grand alliance government in and outside the two Houses.
  
  “Yes, we have been doing what the BJP lawmakers should do as the lead opposition party, but the CM has hosted feast to resume the convention that he himself had snapped. The BJP lawmakers will attend the feast for the healthy parliamentary practice, and nothing much should be read into it,” Jha said.
