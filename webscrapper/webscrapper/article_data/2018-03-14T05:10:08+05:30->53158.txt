MUMBAI: A routine morning walk turned into an ordeal for   Asha Matthew and her 10-month-old daughter as she got dragged a few metres and witnessed her little one being run over by an autorickshaw. Asha's handbag got entangled in the handle of a bike that was zooming by, triggering the freak chain of events. 

  At the time of the incident, the   (35) was holding the baby, Esther, in her arms. Both were headed to  's grandmother's house when Asha lost control, fell down and lost her grip on the baby. Motorists and pedestrians rushed to their rescue and took them to a nearby nursing home where the baby underwent a full-body CT scan.
 
  The scan revealed that Esther had suffered a chest injury with accumulation of air and blood around the lungs and a hint of hairline fracture. She could barely breathe. Seeing the child in terrible pain, the family shifted her to Fortis Hospital, Mulund. 
 
 Recalling the traumatizing incident, Asha said, "Everything happened in minutes. It was horrible to watch her in so much pain. I am happy that the moment of despair is finally over". Esther was recently discharged from hospital after nearly two weeks. 
 
  The child was admitted to the paediatric ICU. The child was first started on painkillers as doctors worked simultaneously to improve her breathing. "The child was crying, in shock and pain. We immediately put her on pain medication and supported her breathing by a lung support device. The baby responded well and was kept under observation for a few days," said Dr Jesal Sheth, neonatal intensivist. He added that the child is alright now. 
 
 Asha said the hospital helped her to cope with the trauma through counselling and assurances that her baby would recover.
