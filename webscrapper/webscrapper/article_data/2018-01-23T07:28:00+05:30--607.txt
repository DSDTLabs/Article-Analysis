Chandigarh: Panjab University Teachers’ Association ( ) president Rajesh Gill, on Monday, wrote to the PU vice-chancellor Arun Kumar Grover to expedite the reconstruction of service books of teachers on a priority basis. Eight months after the service books were destroyed in fire that engulfed the first floor of the varsity’s administrative block, they have not been reconstructed, due to which the arrears of the teachers are pending.

 “This has reference to the unfortunate incident last year, wherein the service books of a number of teachers were burnt in fire. Even after so many months, a number of teachers have been desperately making the rounds of the concerned branches at the administrative office, to get their service books reconstructed. In a number of cases, the arrears of teachers have been lying pending for want of service books. This issue was raised by the undersigned as president of PUTA in last senate meeting held on December 16, 2017, to which the university authorities had assured that these would be reconstructed without delay,” read the letter sent by the PUTA president. 
 
 PUTA president Rajesh Gill said in the recent meeting of PUTA executives held on January 16, 2018, Ram Mehar, USOL, raised the issue, citing the “pathetic” state of a number of teachers, who have been suffering due to the loss of their service books. Their pleas to the authorities have failed to produce any desired result, causing avoidable desperation among them.
 
 PUTA has demanded to get all the service books of teachers reconstructed on priority, without any further delay. “Further, this must not be done on a pick and choose basis, to avoid any kind of alienation among the faculty members,” read the communication.
