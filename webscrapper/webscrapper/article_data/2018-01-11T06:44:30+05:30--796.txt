AHMEDABAD: Here is a challenge for Amdavadis to keep their   till January 26. CII’s Young Indians (Yi) group launched a campaign this January called #mutedrivechallenge on Facebook where Amdavadis have been asked to reset tripmeters to ‘zero’ and post a picture along with #mutedrivechallenge. 

 The challenge is to collectively as a city clock 50,000km without honking. “On January 25, Amdavadis will have to post another picture of their tripmeters with the kilometres they travelled without honking. We will add up the numbers on the tripmeters to clock 50,000km in silence,” said Shrinjay Joshi, chair of Yi, Ahmedabad.
 
 “We have to begin somewhere as a city. The campaign will provide positive feedback,” Joshi said.
 
 On Wednesday morning municipal commissioner Mukesh Kumar tweeted a pledge to avoid honking for all of 2018. “Cities will work for citizens only if there is collective ownership and responsibility. If you work for the city, the city works for you. Honking is one such responsibility for the quieter experience we yearn for in our lives and our city. It is a big challenge for me and I feel it’s worth taking,” says Kumar.
