HYDERABAD: The new political party   Jana Samithi (TJS) will contest the gram panchayat elections likely to be held in the near future. TJS president   said candidates who are committed for development of villages can apply to TJS.

 
 A screening committee will be set up to verify every application. Politicians and candidates who have social work background will be given preference in the party. The proforma to apply to TJS is being finalised and would be made available to the people soon through the media, Facebook, Whatsapp and the TJS website.
 
 “The decentralisation of finances and power to the gram panchayats as envisaged by the 73rd and 74th Constitutional amendments has not taken place in Telangana at the desired levels. The TJS has been getting lots of response from every gram panchayat. There is a need to strengthen the gram panchayats, increase the participation of people in development process and finally gram panchayats should play a crucial role in the development of Telangana state,” Kodandaram said while inviting interested candidates to join TJS ahead of the panchayat elections.
 
 He also appealed to the TJS leaders and cadre at village and mandal level to encourage every citizen to verify his or her name in the electoral rolls the revision of which for the panchayat polls is going on. The last date is May 8 as such all the TJS leaders should ensure that every citizen is enrolled on the voters list, Kodandaram said.
 
 Former MLC   said the TJS is supporting the demand of state government employees for abolition of contributory pension scheme and restoration of old pension scheme. TJS leader G Vidyadhar Reddy demanded that government should pay adequate compensation to the farmers losing their agriculture activity due to laying of high tension electricity wires and erection of towers through their agriculture fields.
 
 TJS leader   said the technical committee of the TJS would expose the corrupt policies of TRS government.
