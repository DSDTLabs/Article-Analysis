COIMBATORE: The Social Democratic Auto Union ( ) on Monday urged the Coimbatore district administration to revise the autorickshaw fares in the district and fix the minimum fare at Rs 35 for 1.8 km. 

 The SDTU, which submitted a petition to the district administration, said the government should fix a fare which is economically viable for autorickshaw drivers.
 
 SDTU members said the autorickshaw fares should be revised immediately and be made Rs 35 for the first 1.8km and Rs 18 for every additional kilometer. 
 
 “None of the autorickshaw drivers follow the old fare because it is economically unviable in Coimbatore, where living costs constantly go up,” said SDTU district secretary Rahubu Nithar. 
 
 “The profits and money earned by drivers here is also different. We can follow the new fare only if it is reasonable,” said Nithar.
