MUMBAI: A Byculla resident lost Rs80,000 to card   after the money was withdrawn from ATMs in   and   on July 17. Varun Nambiar (25) was shocked when he found through transaction details that the money was withdrawn within an hour even though his debit card has a Rs40,000 withdrawal limit per day. The bank and JJ Marg police have not registered an FIR case despite repeated follow-ups by Nambiar. 

 The money was withdrawn at night when the 25-year-old post-graduate student pursuing an MBA was asleep. “I lost the entire money I earned while working with a CA firm and studying in the last one year. Surprisingly, the money was withdrawn from ATMs when the withdrawal limit was Rs40,000, which shows the bank’s flaw,” Nambiar told TOI.
 
 The first two transactions of Rs20,000 were carried out at 12.03am and 12.05am, while the other five for Rs10,000 each were done in between 12.05am-1am. “When I called the bank customer care number at night, they replied that the money would get reversed in the morning. When I checked online in the morning, nothing was left in my account. Now, the bank has put up its hands up,” he said.
 
 Police, instead of registering an FIR, only acknowledged Nambiar’s written complaint on July 17. Senior inspector   said he will look into the matter and told the victim to visit the police station to lodge an FIR on Sunday.
