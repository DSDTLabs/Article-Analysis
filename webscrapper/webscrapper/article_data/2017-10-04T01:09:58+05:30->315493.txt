MUMBAI:   Praful and Usha Barad (both 35) and two of their   were killed in an   on   in Anand district in   on Sunday evening. One of their relatives, who was travelling with them in a car, is hospitalized with eight hip fractures. 

  The couple lived in a joint family at Rathodi village in Malad (W). Praful, who owned a car, worked as a driver with a cab aggregator. The Barads’ neighbours said Praful was a ‘safe driver’ and a teetotaller. 
 
 On Sunday, the Barads, Praful’s uncle Bhanji Barad (70), and aunts Kanchan (55) and Rama Bamaniya (51) left for their hometown near Ahmedabad in his car. The couple wanted to perform a puja at a temple in their hometown.
 
 “Around 4.30pm, two trucks collided into their car near Kasbara village. The car was completely crushed. The bodies were extricated with great difficulty,” said a family friend. Only Rama survived with severe injuries.
 
 Neighbours said Praful grew up in Rathodi, an East Indian village, and spoke the local dialect of Marathi. 
 
 “We would fondly call him ‘Mac’ because he was so much like us,” said Noella Varela, a neighbour. “Usha was very keen to have a baby and followed any ritual suggested to her. Half an hour before the accident, she called up her sister-in-law in Malad and asked her to feed her pet rabbit. Later, the sister-in-law received a call from Usha’s phone and a stranger told her about the accident and the four deaths.”
