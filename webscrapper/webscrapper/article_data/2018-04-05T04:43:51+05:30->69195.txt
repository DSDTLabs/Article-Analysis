A day after a two-year-old girl from Kalyan drowned after falling into the   in Kerala during a boat ride, sources close to the family said negligence might have caused the accident and she might have been saved if the houseboat had safety systems. 

 Anvitha Shetty, 2, was playing with her parents and brother in the forward section of the houseboat when she slipped from her father's grasp and fell into the river. Her father, Sivaprasad Shetty, said, "My right hand was fractured a month ago in Mumbai and I just couldn't catch her."
 
 Samir Bhalerao, a close friend of the family, who had suggested that they undertake the houseboat cruise in Alappuzha, said safety measures like installing railings around the boat edge could have prevented the tragedy. "The sides and forward sections lack railings and chances are high that someone might fall over," said Bhalerao. "There was a delay in saving the child and she died. We need good boat crews who can act as a lifeguard during emergencies," he said.
 
 Anvitha's body has been handed over to her father at 11.45am after completing legal and medical formalities at  . The body was to be flown to Mumbai on Wednesday, said sources.
 
 District collector   said she will hold a discussion with houseboat owners to avoid such accidents in future. "Children are safe when they are with parents and here a child died in their presence. I feel lifejacket for babies is impractical. We will discuss the safety aspects with tourism department," she said.
