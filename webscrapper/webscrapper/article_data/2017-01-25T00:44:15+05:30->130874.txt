MUMBAI: Weeks after the polls to the municipal corporations and   were notified, the   government has come to a standstill due to the election code and as several bureaucrats and police officers have been deployed in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.

 A high-ranking bureaucrat said 119 officials have been deployed in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab.
 
 “The entire state has been covered under the code of conduct. Besides the elections to the 10 municipal corporations and 25 zilla parishads, elections are scheduled from the teachers’ and graduates’ constituencies. As a result, we have been restrained from undertaking any developmental work across the state,” he added.
 
 Under the code of conduct, since there are stringent restrictions even routine work has been hampered. “No minister will take up routine work even if it is not against the code of conduct and well within the framework of law. Till the entire election process for the civic and zilla parishad polls is over, no policy decisions will be taken,” he said.
 
 The bureaucrat pointed out that two leaders, state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve and dairy development minister Mahadev Jankar are already under the Election Commission’s scrutiny and criminal cases have been registered against them for violation of the poll code. 
 
 Meanwhile, the general administration department has set up a three member committee headed by chief secretary Swadheen Kshatriya for processing the proposals received by the state government.
