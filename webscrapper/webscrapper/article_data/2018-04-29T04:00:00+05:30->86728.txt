Surat: The special operations group (SOG) of Valsad police recovered 285 live cartridges from a 23-year-old labourer of a paper mill in Vapi on Saturday. Ten different types of cartridges were seized from the man by the police.

 Police arrested Ganesh Saroj, a resident of Quality Pulp and Paper Mill compound in Vapi GIDC, who told them that he had found the cartridges in a box from the waste material imported from a foreign country to be used for making paper. Police recovered the cartridges in a container from the accused worth Rs28,500. An offence was registered at Vapi GIDC police station and further investigation handed over to SOG.
 
 Police investigation revealed that Saroj, a native of Pratapgarh in Uttar Pradesh, had found the cartridges while segregating the waste. He did not inform his employers at Quality Pulp and Paper Mill and took the cartridges home. He was in search of some buyers when the police nabbed him.
 
 “We are yet to find out how Saroj found the cartridges. We are interrogating him and further investigation will reveal how he found the cartridges. There are 10 different types of cartridges and they are of sophisticated make,” superintendent of police, Valsad, Sunil Joshi said.
 
 Police will be recovering CCTV footages of the paper unit to find out if Saroj is telling the truth. They are also examining details of the containers that had brought imported waste to the unit. 
 
 “Once it is confirmed that the cartridges were found from imported waste, then police will try to find out from where the container had got customs clearance. It is a serious matter that cartridges in such a large quantity had reached an industrial unit,”the police said.
