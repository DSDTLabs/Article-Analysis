PATNA: The district administration will deploy over 1,000 police personnel in and around the city on Friday to avoid any untoward incident during the special session of Bihar assembly for the floor test of the newly formed NDA government headed by chief minister  . 

 Apprehending sporadic violence following change of guard in the state, the government has also asked all districts to remain on alert. Sources said security personnel and magistrates will be deployed in at least 76 points in the city to maintain law and order.
 
 A senior Patna district administration official said valid pass will be mandatory for everyone entering the assembly premises. “All officials have been asked to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedure for VIP security,” he added.
 
 The worry of the state government could be gauged from the fact that the Union ministry of home affairs okayed Z+ security for Nitish soon after he tendered his resignation on Wednesday. However, the CM refused to accept Z+ security cover.
 
 Around 200 armed Bihar Military Police personnel have been made available to Patna police for deployment on the streets on Friday. “Altogether 10 DSPs, four inspectors and 15 sub-inspectors will be on duty,” said a source.
 
 District public relations officer   said DM   has instructed   to keep an eye on security arrangements. “ADM (law and order) Ashutosh Verma and city SP (central)   have also been asked to check force deployment at all the 76 points,” he added.
