LUCKNOW:   has directed UP state election commission to use ballot papers in the polls for urban bodies even as BSP, SP and   have raised question mark on the assembly polls alleging that   (EVMs) were tampered. 

 UP's chief election officer S K Agarwal told TOI that in a telephonic conversation with him,   Nasim Zaidi regretted that the EVMs being used at present were worn out and were being used since before 2006. "We are prepared to hold the forthcoming elections to urban bodies using ballot papers provided the CEC informs us within a day or two," said Agarwal. 
 
 These elections are due in June and notification will be announced by the end of May. Revision of voter list and other preparations are already underway. 
 
 The SEC had written a letter to the   last year to provide EVMs for the election of mayors and nagar nigam wards while asking for using ballot papers for nagar panchayat and nagar panchayat parishad polls. This pattern was used in 2012 as well.
 
 Two days ago, when the SEC reminded the EC about EVMs, the central body expressed its inability to send the same, saying most of them were worn out.
