It was yet another day in the backstreets of the   bazaar for 11-year-old Moshe who spent many more hours at the Chabad   on Wednesday saying his morning prayers, chatting with guests including Rabbi Eliezer Ashkenazi from the Chabad in Thailand and returning to the House again for his evening meal, notwithstanding the ghastly terror strike that had killed his parents, nine years ago. 

 His face framed by long-curled side locks hanging from the corners of his head, typical of men and boys in the   Jewish community, Moshe along with his grandparents visited the Yaakov Finkelstein, Israel’s Consul General in Lower Parel later in the day and stopped by the   in Mahalaxmi for a look at Mumbai’s largest human powered laundry. Lauding Moshe for his “bravery of returning to Mumbai” Finkelstein said, “We discussed the meaningful symbolism in Moshe and his family’s return to the city and the circles they have opened and closed with this visit.”
 
 For  , ‘Baby’ Moshe’s uncle and younger brother of slain   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s arrival in Mumbai on Wednesday evening alongside  , the was a gesture that could speak volumes about solidarity against acts of terror. “We’re super excited. It is a strong statement that answers terrorism. Love will douse hate and light will overpower darkness. We would also like to see justice for all the victims of terrorists. As we know, most of the terrorists have not been accounted for,” he told TOI on Wednesday.
