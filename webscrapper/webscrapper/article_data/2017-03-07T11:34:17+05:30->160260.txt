City peeps got their weekly fix of music, munchies and masti at a cafe in   recently. Youngsters   and   on the guitars along with   on the keyboard doled out some great jazz, rock and reggae tunes. The music set a great mood for the folks in the cafe getting their evening cuppa. Cheering and hooting every chance they got, the guests made the most of the evening and looked like they had a great time.
