These have the best of both worlds.   from   Experience, says, "You can get the natural nail look and flexibility of a gel nail with the strength and control of an acrylic nail with this latest nail trend - T3 LED/ UV Cool Cure Sculpting Gel."

 It is always best to remove gel nails with the help of nail technicians at a professional nail bar, where they have the best quality products. However, if you want to do it yourself, you must invest in a gel remover especially formulated for this. Begin by soaking cotton in the gel remover and placing on your nail carefully. Using a foil, wrap it up and then cover with a hand towel. This can take almost an hour. When you see the gel sliding off, use a clean cuticle pusher and clean the nail bed. Be gentle and then use cuticle oil. Apply a generous coat of cuticle moisturiser.
