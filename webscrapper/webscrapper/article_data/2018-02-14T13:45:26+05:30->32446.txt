TIRUPUR: A day after allegation of swindling of Rs 2.03 crore was made against the former president of   panchayat, officials in the district administration are yet to look into the petition submitted by   cadres in this regard. 

 Sources, including a higher revenue official, admitted that the petition submitted on Monday has been forwarded to the assistant director of panchayats (Tirupur). But when   contacted AD of panchayats, he said, “I did not receive the petition, so far.”
 
 Block development officer (BDO) of   said, “Since the amount mentioned in the allegation was higher, the petition must be with the higher authority. We, so far, did not hear anything about it.”
 
 TOI attempted to track the petition but all the officials including audit division officials replied that they were yet to hear about it.
 
 However, a senior official associated with the directorate of rural development agency said, “Generally, one cannot come to a conclusion that there was corruption based on the remarks made in the annual audit reports. When the remarks are made, if the civic body authorities were able to produce right reason and adequate documents including bill receipts immediately or later, the remarks will be ratified. Otherwise, the auditor- deputy BDO (audit) - could issue a charge memo against the civic body.”
 
 “With that charge memo, the government will recover the loss from the civic body authorities under the Revenue Recovery Act,” he said. 
 
 “But so far, we did not issue any such charge memos against former Palangarai panchayat president  , who was in the office between 2006 and 2016 when Rs 2.02 crore was allegedly swindled from the panchayat,” said the senior official.
 
 M Palanisamy of CPM obtained the information about annual audit reports for 2006-16 under the   act.
