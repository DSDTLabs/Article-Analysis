More than a thousand engineering students from colleges across   participated in the technical fest ‘IGNITE – 2017’, held at Gurunanak Institute of Technology, Ibrahimpatanam recently. While the students showcased some very innovative creations, the highlight of the fest was the All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) Nebula. Touted as the most powerful ATV with a smallest wheel base, the Nebula garnered the maximum attention from the people. Among the other innovative creations on display were an award winning go-kart, an automatic fly jet dam, live water recycling systems, and an array of bikes and hovercrafts.
Events like flash mob, vintage bike rally, drag race and an air show gave the students plenty to cheer about.
