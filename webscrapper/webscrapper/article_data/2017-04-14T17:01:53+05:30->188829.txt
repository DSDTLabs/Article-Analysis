BENGALURU: This might please those who felt   has been given an unduly high salary — the   CEO has received only 46% of his target variable compensation for 2016-17.

 It’s a reflection of the modest performance of the company in the year. But it might also be, partially, in deference to co-founder N R   and other promoters who have been 
  increases given to top executives, including Sikka and chief operating officer  , over the past year or so. Sikka has received $3.68 million of his target variable compensation of $8 million for 2016-17. He has a fixed compensation of $3 million. So his total take home for the year is $6.68 million of the total $11 million. This is lower than the $7.45 million that he drew in 2015-16.
 
 The company board and Sikka have consistently maintained that the increase in compensation granted was primarily in the variable portion, and that the variable compensation was tied to steep performance goals. What those goals are have not been publicly disclosed. Asked about Sikka’s compensation for the last fiscal, chairman   said the variable compensation was linked to performance. “I have not come across any other company where compensation is linked to targets.
 
 And Vishal, to his eternal credit, said since he has articulated the target ($20 billion by 2020-21), he would like to hold himself accountable to this vision. It is not often that people would have that kind of courage.”
 
 Infosys’ performance in 2016-17 has been disappointing, after three downward revisions in its revenue guidance over the year. The performance makes it extremely difficult for the company to meet Sikka’s aspiration to hit $20 billion in revenue by 2020-21.
 
 Sikka’s variable compensation is divided into three parts —  , restricted stock units (RSUs), and stock options. For 2016-17, he will receive $0.82 million of the $3 million of target variable pay, and $2.86 million of the targeted $5 million in RSUs and stock options.
