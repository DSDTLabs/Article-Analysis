NEW DELHI: For the sixth time in just two months, high   levels in Yamuna have led to sub-optimal functioning of water-treatment plants, affecting   in many areas. Delhi government is now planning to take its   counterpart to   on the issue. 

 Dinesh Mohania, vice-chairman of DJB and AAP MLA from Sangam Vihar, said: “The problem is occurring repeatedly from the Haryana side. We will either approach the Supreme court or NGT soon.” A DJB’s quality control department official claimed that despite several meetings with Haryana officials, there had been no improvement in the quality of river   flowing in from that state.
 
 Ammonia level, which ideally should be nil, has crossed 2ppm. DJB can only treat 0.9 parts per million ppm of ammonia content. “The Panipat dye drain is bringing all untreated industrial waste into Yamuna due to which color, chloride, hardness and ammonia levels have increased. We can manage other impurities, but the colour and ammonia levels are way beyond acceptable limits,” a senior DJB official said.
 
 DJB officials said they had no option, but to go in for rationing. Over the last two days, the situation has improved at the Haiderpur and Bawana plants. But Wazirabad and Chandrawal are still operating 20MGD and 10MGD below their capacity, the DJB official said. 
 
 Many areas in north and west Delhi have been receiving water at reduced pressure. Ritesh Dewan from Shalimar Bagh’s RWA said due to low pressure, water supply was erratic on upper floors. Sudha Sinha, general secretary of Federation of CGHS Dwarka, complained of a similar problem. “We were asked to remove our booster pumps recently and now the supply has further deteriorated,” Sinha said.
