At a fashion event held in Mumbai on Saturday,   actresses  ,  ,   and   ditched the traditional portrayal of Indian brides and chose to be fun, frolic and flirtatious on ramp instead. The ladies — all walked as showstoppers for different designers — were carefree on stage and their relaxed, bohemian spirit cast a spell on one and all.

 Dressed in a heavily embellished lehenga, Sushmita Sen danced her heart away and channelled the inner yesteryear Bollywood bombshells within her. Bipasha, on the other hand, was seen in a one-shoulder red cocktail gown that complimented her bold lips and chocolate brown mane.Talking about her outfit, Bipasha jokingly said, “Ever since I got married, all the designers are making me wear red. But yes, red is my favourite colour. Thank you for making me look beautiful.”
 
 Tamannaah, too, was in her element — smiling from ear-to-ear and giving hilarious media interviews. The ‘Baahubali’ actress, who was the showstopper for an apsara-themed collection, said her golden and red lehenga was for today’s bride. “It is for today’s bride. A bride who wants to dance her heart out and run around at her wedding. It is for the modern, free-spirited bride and I love the costumes.” As for Aditi, that lustrous hair and her natural pout did all the talking!
