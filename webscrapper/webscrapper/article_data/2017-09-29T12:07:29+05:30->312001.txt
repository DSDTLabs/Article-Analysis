CHANDIGARH: Punjab has shown the worst performance in implementation of the central government’s Unnat Jyoti Affordable LEDs for All (Ujala) scheme as compared to  ,   and Chandigarh.

 Ujala is the Union government’s energy-efficiency pan-India programme launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in January 2015 to promote use of most efficient lighting technology at affordable rates by consumers. The Centre also intends to reduce energy consumption in lighting so as to help power distribution companies manage peak demand.
 
 Till Thursday, around 2.50 lakh LED bulbs, 13,380 LED tubelights and 5,704 energy efficient fans had been distributed in 10 districts of Punjab by the Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a joint venture company of power ministry’s public sector undertakings. As per EESL, the distribution of just around 2.50 lakh LED bulbs till date would help Punjab save 32,558 mega watt of energy per year, the cost of which amounts to Rs 13 crore.
 
 Haryana tops the region in implementation of Ujala scheme, followed by hill state Himachal Pradesh and union territory Chandigarh. Around 1.33 crore LED bulbs, 1.46 lakh LED tubelights and 42,442 energy efficients fans had been distributed in 22 districts of Haryana till Thursday. However, Himachal Pradesh has recorded distribution of around 76.36 lakh LED bulbs, 37,993 LED tubelights and 10,172 energy efficients fans till now. As many as 3.18 lakh LED bulbs, 34,598 LED tubelights and 11,752 energy efficients fans had been distributed to Chandigarh residents in the past.
 
 Punjab’s principal secretary power, A Venu Prasad, told TOI that implementation of the scheme was being monitored by the Centre and the EESL was distributing the LED bulbs by setting up kiosks in different districts. “Since the scheme was launched in Punjab after the assembly elections this year, the response has been slow. It may pick up later,” said Prasad.
 
 Till date, there has been no implementation of Ujala scheme in   and Pathankot districts facing   bypoll on October 11. Other such districts include Moga, Faridkot, Fatehgarh Sahib, Muktsar, Bathinda, Mansa, Sangrur, Barnala, Hoshiarpur, Rupnagar and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar.
 
 The nodal organisation, EESL, was tasked to set up phase-wise LED distribution centers across the country to distribute affordable LED bulbs, tubelights and fans on either upfront basis or through on-bill financing. LED bulb is being sold for Rs 70, 20 watt LED tubelight for Rs 230 and energy efficient fan for Rs 1,150 against the market price of around Rs 150, Rs 800 and Rs 1,800, respectively.
