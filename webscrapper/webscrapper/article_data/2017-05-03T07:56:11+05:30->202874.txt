JAIPUR: Setting the momentum for upcoming state assembly elections, government is all set to issue lease deed to   who have settled on panchayat   before December 31, 2016 in nominal amount. 

 For 300 square yard of land, villagers will have to pay a token amount of Rs 200 to get the lease deed. Beyond that government will charge 25% of the existing   rates. The decision is likely to benefit more than 4 lakh families living in rural parts of the state.
 
 Sources claim that chief minister has given her approval and notification is expected to be issued in next two days. “Once vetted by the law department notification for amendments in the Panchayati Raj rules will be released” said an official. 
 
 Similar amendments were made in the year 1996 with cut-off date fixed at December 31, 1996. However those benefits were granted to only 20 selected communities. Major among them were SC, ST, nomadic, semi-nomadic, divyangs, gadiya lohar and  . 
 
 “Except 20 communities, all settlers on   land after 1996 were to pay regular fee for getting the land deed” added the official. In the proposed amendments government will open it for all the villagers, removing the cap of caste. 
 
 For the distribution of land deeds, special camps will be organized at the panchayat level. Sources claim that, decision has opened window for those to have land on their own name, even if they at present are the encroachers. 
 
 The decision would not need approval from the cabinet as it is policy decision for which department is authorized to take a call.
