CHENNAI: Angry snakes chase anyone who gets too close.That is just one of many myths about snakes and snakebites. The truth is people usually stumble upon a snake and, in their fear, think the snake is after them.

 A puppetry show at Chennai Snake Park on Sunday unravelled many false beliefs about what are really fascinating reptiles.
 
 Prof R Kaleeswaran of  , who conducted the hour-long show, said the storyline was based on creating awareness about false beliefs surrounding snakes and snakebites.
 
 While the first half was dedicated to puppetry , the se cond half had folk dances of Tamil Nadu. These dance forms had themes related to snakes, hence they were chosen for the programme, Kaleeswaran said. The 30-minute show be gins by explaining about various snakes from around the world. It graduates to the most important bit -what to do when bitten by a snake, which is mostly about first aid -and ends with how to protect oneself from snakebites. This is followed by traditional dances (Silambattam, Karagattam, Oyilattam and Thappattam) of   performed by folk artists.
 
  member S   said the four-day programme was organised as part of Wildlife Week celebrations starting on Monday. As there was a good response for the show in the last four days, it was decided to hold it every Sunday at the park.
