The six-pack-hunk of M-town,   is happy that he got to explore another creative side of his. And you know how? He recently wrote the lyrics for a song in   and also sung it!

  A visibly excited Unni says, 'It was something which I had never done earlier and it sounds really cute and beautiful!'
 The film's music is by Ratheesh Vega. Talking about his singing experience, the actor says, 'Though I have given voice overs for my movies, I never had an experience of singing in a studio. It took Ratheeshettan and me five hours to write the lyrics and I sang it in just one-and-a-half hours. We just finished the recording on Sunday.' 
  Quiz the actor as to what prompted him to try singing, Unni reveals, 'We had a small after shoot party recently at Vagamon and we were all singing. As the impromptu session gained momentum, it turned out to be a jugalbandi session between Jayaramettan and me. While everybody was cheering for us, the director of the movie, Kannan Thamarakulam suggested why don't I sing for the film.' 
 
 Unni says that he was a bit hesitant and that's when Ratheesh Vega too motivated him to try. 'Ratheeshettan encouraged me and we thought of coming up with something that suits the movie,' he adds. 
 
  On the song, the composer tells us that it will be a three-and-a-half minute long romantic melody. 'It was a surprise for me to know that there is a singer beneath his six packs,' says Ratheesh, who also had made Amala Paul and Prakash Raj sing for the film.
