At the most basic level, the human body is a conglomeration of all the nutrients. We provide it through food. In other words, you are what you eat. For decades now we have been trying to identify the most nutritious elements of food, and how they interact within our bodies to provide the necessary fuel for development. Every day there is news of at least one food item that may be good (or bad) for the health. There is one class of food that has been in the “good for health” side most of the time, namely, the   and seeds. We are still learning about the components of nuts and seeds that make them so healthful, and their various health benefits.

 A recent systematic analysis of 36 studies involving 30,708 patients demonstrated a link between daily nut consumption and overall risk of developing cancer. The studies included in this analysis had follow-up periods ranging from 4 to 30 years. The association between nuts and the   was especially evident for colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and pancreatic cancer. However, the risk of other   types or type 2 diabetes was found to be relatively unaffected by the intake of nuts, although there wasn’t enough evidence to completely eliminate an association in these cases. The heart-protective effects of nuts have been extensively examined previously, and this study highlighted the lack of information on their cancer-protective effects, thus paving the way for a more detailed assessment of the beneficial effects of nuts on the prevention of various types of cancer. 
 
 As the saying goes, good things come in small packages, and a handful of these little gems everyday can shield you from some of the most debilitating diseases known to man.
