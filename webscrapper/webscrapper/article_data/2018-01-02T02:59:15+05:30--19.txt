Inderjeet, who was wanted in several extortion cases in the past, told the police that he desperately needed money and, while having tea at a roadside stall in Mayur Vihar, saw the victim, Jawahar Lal, coming out of a bank and mistook him to be a customer carrying a lot of money in his bag. 
 
 Lal (60), who works as a peon at the bank in Acharya Niketan, said he was abducted when he was heading home after work in an auto and thrashed continuously by one of the accused as the men kept looking for a place to drop him. Lal, who has got an extension, said the three men in a white Santro car abducted him after he refused to hand over his cash and mobile phone. 
 
 After receiving a PCR call around 5.40pm, a team from Pandav Nagar police station was sent to trace Lal. “A team led by ACP Shobhit Saksena was formed to determine the identity of the accused and nab them,” said Omvir Singh, deputy commissioner of police (east).

Soon Lal was traced at a private hospital in Sector 157, Noida. 
 
 Besides Bhati, who owned the car, the other accused have been identified as Manoj Dedha (26), who thrashed Lal, and Guddu Chamkan (21), an addict who wanted money to buy drugs. They were arrested from different places in east Delhi. Based on their interrogation, the police have also seized the car.
