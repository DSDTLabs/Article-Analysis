SS Rajamouli’s ‘
 ’ (Hindi) has continued its romp at the Indian box-office by collecting an estimated total of Rs 15.50 crore nett on its second Tuesday. This collection has thus helped the film cross another 100-crore milestone with collections recording at Rs 112 crore approximately, within five days of its second week, according to reports on Boxofficeindia.com.
 
 The Hindi version of ‘Baahubali 2’ collected as much as Rs 245 crore in its first week at the ticket window, and continued to roar at the box-office by starting off its second weekend with collections recording in at Rs 20 crore on Friday and Rs 26.50 crore on Saturday, Rs 33.50 crore approx on Sunday and Monday’s collection recording in at approximately Rs 16.50 crore. Rounding up Tuesday’s collection thus takes the grand domestic total of the Hindi version to approximately Rs 357 crore.
 
 
  
 Within five days into the second week, the film has thus broken the second week box-office record, previously held by Aamir Khan’s ‘Dangal’ that had collected Rs 111.56 crore nett. This in itself is being considered a huge feat as the film crossed the 100-crore benchmark in its second week, without the benefit of a holiday or an extended festive weekend.
  
 As there seems to be no stop to ‘Baahubali 2’ at the box-office, the film’s second week collections are expected to rise even further, thus leaving behind ‘Dangal’ with collections of Rs 111.56 crore, ‘PK’ collections of Rs 96.37 crore, Salman Khan’s ‘Bajrangi Bhaijaan’ at Rs 86.28 crore and ‘Dhoom 3’ closing in the fifth spot with Rs 64.51 crore.
