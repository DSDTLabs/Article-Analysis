NEW DELHI:   leader 
  batteries charged to today ridicule avid yoga practitioner PM   for not being able to do the 'padmasana', or the lotus position - in short, to talk about the PM's "insincerity."

 "I saw PM Modi doing yoga on yoga day. The PM did all kinds of asanas - quite well - but he could not do the padmasana," the Congress vice president said at the 'Jan Vedna Sammelan' of the Congress in Delhi.
 
 "I've done some yoga. Admittedly, I'm not very good at it, but my yoga guru used to tell me that if you practice yoga regularly, you can very easily do the padmasana. The converse though isn't true. Anyone who doesn't do yoga regularly can't do the Padmasana," Rahul said, piling insult upon injury.
 
 The Congress leader's broad brush ridiculed the PM for various things with his yoga example. On the one hand, Rahul was accusing the Prime Minister of not being able to perform any task well, or even adequately. Thus, the accusation about him not being able to do the padmasana.
 
 In addition, Rahul was also targeting Modi for what he believed is his "insincerity". Thus, Rahul said, here's this man who talks of being a regular yoga practitioner, but he can't even do the simple padmasana. The implication being that the PM is "insincere."
 
 Rahul gave another example to demonstrate the PM's "incompetence." He talked about at an event when PM Modi handed brooms to people - and held one himself - to demonstrate how he was going to clean a "corrupt India."
 
 "When the PM went with a broom to talk about cleaning India up, did you see how he was holding the broom? Nothing gets cleaned if you hold the broom like that," Rahul said to the guffaws of the crowd.
 
 Rahul attacked PM Modi directly for 
  and said that "for the first time, an Indian PM is being ridiculed across the world for taking a decision like this." "No credible economist has supported the demonetization," Rahul said.
