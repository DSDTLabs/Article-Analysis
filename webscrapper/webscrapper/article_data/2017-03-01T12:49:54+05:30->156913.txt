After the teaser of Pawan Kalyan’s ‘Katamarayudu’ received a phenomenal response from fans, the makers dropped a surprise behind the scenes video of the actor receiving a special gift on the film sets.

  
  
 The video presumably shot while the   was still shooting, shows a surprised and happy PK being gifted a double edged golden sword by fellow actor  . Going by the video, Pawan seemed ecstatic with his gift that he went parading it around the sets with comedian   in tow, who cracks the famous Sholay line, ”Yeh haath mujhe dede Thakur.” 
 
 Overall, it looks like the Powerstar had a good time on the sets with his cast and crew. ‘Katamarayudu’ is reportedly all set for an Ugadi release this month.
