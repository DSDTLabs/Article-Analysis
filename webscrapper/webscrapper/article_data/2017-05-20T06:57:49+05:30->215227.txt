HYDERABAD: Following in the footsteps of the   (CBSE), Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, has issued an elaborate list of items prohibited in exam centres during the joint entrance exam (JEE) (Advanced) on May 21. 

 As many as 15,115 candidates will appear for the exam in the four regions of Telangana — Hyderabad, Mahbubnagar, Nizamabad and Warangal. The organising committee has imposed stringent security measures to prevent malpractice, just like it was done for the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) on May 7. Many NEET candidates were asked to cut the length of their sleeves and made to remove shoes and jewellery. Some were even seen borrowing chappals from their parents.
 
 According to the instructions, JEE (Advanced) candidates “should not wear charms,  , items containing metals such as ring, bracelet, earrings, nose-pin, chains/necklace, pendants, badge, brooch, hair pin, hair band, clothes with full sleeves or big buttons.” Students have been asked to wear open footwear like chappal and sandal instead of shoes. The list goes on to say that violation of any rule at any stage of the examination will lead to the cancellation of candidature.
 
 The stringent measures have left candidates jittery. “In our coaching institutes, we are constantly reminded about the restrictions imposed at exam centres. Although I will go well-prepared for the exam, I am worried about the frisking that will happen,” said Radhika Kondety, an aspirant. 
 
 Coaching centres owners also said the measures were a tad too harsh. 
 
 “The examination last year went off peacefully with hardly any incidences of malpractices. Such stringent measures only make students more nervous as their focus shifts away from the exam,” said  , IIT programme in-charge at Narayana Educational Pvt Ltd.
