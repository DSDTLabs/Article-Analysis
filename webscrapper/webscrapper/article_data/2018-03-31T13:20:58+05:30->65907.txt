BHUBANESWAR: The Naveen Patnaik-led   on Friday said that it would not support the impeachment motion against Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra. 

 BJD Rajya Sabha MP   said such rumours are being spread by political rivals. "We have the highest regard for the CJI. We strongly condemn   messages being spread by rumour-mongers. 
 
 Those with vested interests must have done this. They believe in divisive politics," he said. A poster has been doing the rounds on social   claiming BJD is in favour of the impeachment motion.
