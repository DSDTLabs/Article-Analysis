CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister   once again raised the demand with the central government to settle the Rs 31,000 crore cash credit limit (CCL) gap amount converted by the Union government into a long-term loan. Seeking the Prime Minister’s intervention, he urged that the settlement should be made implementing the ‘principle of shared responsibilities’ amongst the stakeholders in the procurement process of foodgrains. These include the central government, Punjab government and the consortium of banks.

 In separate letters written to Prime Minister   and Union minister of food and public distribution Ram Vilas  , the chief minister said the CCL gap could not be solely attributed to the Punjab. Amarinder added that the CCL gap had arisen due to systemic and structural reasons.
 
 The chief minister had earlier on January 15, written a letter after which a meeting was held at the level of central government’s secretary expenditure, attended by Punjab government’s representative, in February. “However, no decision has yet been taken,” he added.
 
 In a separate letter to Paswan, the chief minister also raised the issue of release of the pending VAT payment amounting to Rs 952 crore to to the state procurement agencies, as well as non-reimbursement of actual expenditure on procurement of gunny bags, to the state procurement agencies. He has urged the Union ministry and the FCI to reimburse the actual cost of gunny bags to the state as these are purchased for food grains procured on behalf of the central government. 
 
 He reasoned the cost of gunny bags is paid out of the funds borrowed from banks as short term loan, which is repaid by FCI against delivery of food grains. Whereas non-reimbursement of actual expenditure on gunny bags results in huge gap in CCL causing unnecessary burden on state finances. In the current wheat procurement season, 44.63 lakh metric tonnes have been purchased in the Punjab mandis till April 19.
