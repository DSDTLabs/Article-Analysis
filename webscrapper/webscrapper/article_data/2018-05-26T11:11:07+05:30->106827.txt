HYDERABAD: All that glitters is not necessarily gold. At least not for people in Hyderabad. Many price-conscious are elbowing out   jewellery from their must-buy list and settling for imitations. 

 Survey conducted by an online fashion jewellery platform showed that the sale of   has grown by 38% between January and April this year, compared to the figures in the corresponding period in 2017.
 
 "More people are opting for imitation. Of late, its demand has certainly gone up compared to traditional jewellery," the survey said.
 
 They have become a hit with people of all age groups. "I prefer imitation because it's very contemporary and there's so much variety compared to the traditional ones. I can even mix-and-match it with my outfits. It's economical and fashionable at the same time," said an office-goer Anisha Prasad.
 
 Dr Garima Singh, co-founder and CEO of an online fashion jewellery platform, said, "Imitation jewellery is the best choice for the new-age woman. In terms of volume of orders, imitation jewellery grew by 15-20% in the past couple of years in this region. In Hyderabad alone, there's been a growth of 42% in terms of orders placed."
 
 The switch to imitation jewellery has also been spurred by the rising number of chain-snatching incidents in Hyderabad. Among imitation jewellery, those plated with gold are in great demand.
