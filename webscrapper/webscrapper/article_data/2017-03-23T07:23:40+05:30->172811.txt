AHMEDABAD: Members of the Muslim Hit Rakshak Samiti on Wednesday opposed the possible participation of Bangladeshi novelist Taslima Nasrin and Pakistan-born Canadian writer   in the sixth edition of the book fair to be organized by the   (AMC) from May 1.

  The body submitted a memorandum to municipal commissioner   and requested him not to go ahead with the plan, if there was any, to invite the controversial writers to the event. The municipal commissioner, however, said that the AMC was not contemplating an invitation to these writers.
 
 The situation arose after the AMC invited suggestions and many followers of the AMC page on Facebook suggested the names of the two writers.

 Danish Qureshi, who was part of the samiti’s delegation, said that the presence of Fatah and Nasrin might jeopardize peace in the city because of their controversial stand on various issues relating to the Muslim community. “Both writers are refugees. They had to leave their countries because of their positions on several issues that hurt sentiments of Muslims,” Qureshi said. “Their participation could result in the same problem here too.”
