Shimla: Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has hit back at Congress leaders for questioning his frequent visits to Delhi. Addressing a public meeting at Bangana in the Kutlehar assembly constituency, Una district on Sunday, he said that in the interest of getting funds for the state, he would not refrain from taking frequent trips to the National Capital.

 Thakur said the picture has changed in Delhi with Narendra Modi at the helm. The Prime Minister is concerned about the people of Himachal Pradesh unlike the previous incumbent, Thakur said adding had the Union government not granted a loan of Rs 500 crore lately, the coffers of the state government would have been empty without a penny to give to employees. 
 
 Thakur said that it was the Congress government which appointed a number of chief parliamentary secretaries, chairmen and vice-chairmen to various boards and corporations emptying the state coffers. Showering praises on the NDA government at the Centre, he said the country never witnessed such a massive change in terms of development and progress towards digital India. 
 
 He also dared the Congress leaders to prove any act of omission during the four-year rule of the Modi government. “Today India is a super power under Narendra Modi and the whole world acknowledges it,” he added.
 
 Thakur also lambasted the previous Congress government in the state for dilli-dallying preparation of detailed project reports fearing that the Union government would get all the credit. He said that consultancy services for preparation of Detailed Project Report would be completed by March 31 and thereafter the tender process will begin for all sanctioned national highways.
