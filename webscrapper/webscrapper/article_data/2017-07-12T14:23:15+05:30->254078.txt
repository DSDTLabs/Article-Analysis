CHENNAI: For more than a year, residents of   in Chromepet have been hit by an unbearable stench when they open their taps. After repeated complaints about petrol from a gas station on   seeping into groundwater,   Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) officials collected samples of the   last year but no action was taken. 

 Social activist and longtime Chromepet resident   said, "The groundwater close to a   fuel bunk was contaminated due to leakage of petrol. Residents complained to the Pallavaram municipality, the pollution control board and the company. All have said that the quality of water would be restored. But after many spells of rain, the odour of petrol remains and residents are unable to use the water. It's time the company addresses the issue and the pollution control board should monitor the process." 
 
 Another resident S M Govindarajan said, "The recent spell of rain has replenished groundwater but it continues to be contaminated with petrol. People have got skin allergies and health issues due to this."
 
 Residents of Patel Street and Ramachandra Street too voiced their concerns about the issue and said the petrol bunk owner has not responded to their requests for a chemical engineer to visit the place and rectify the problem. A resident who did not wish to be identified said, "No municipality official has come here to address the issue despite the residents suffering. This water cannot even be used to water plants as it contains chemicals."
 
 "Hindustan Petroleum, Pallavaram municipality and other concerned authorities should work in tandem and ensure that this problem is solved. We are forced to buy bottled water for drinking," added Govindarajan. The residents' associations are planning to move the Madras high court against the petroleum company if the issue is not resolved.
