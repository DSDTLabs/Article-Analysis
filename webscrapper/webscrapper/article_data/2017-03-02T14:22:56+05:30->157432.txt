NAGPUR: “Urbanization has led to fast vanishing of  , once known as the greenest city in India. Nagpur may also go the Bengaluru way as a lot of   are taking place here for which trees are chopped down, leading to loss of green cover,” said  , professor and coordinator of energy and welfare research group, Centre for Ecological Science, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.

 Delivering a lecture on ‘Carbon footprint of Bengaluru with rapid urbanization’, organized by CSIR-Neeri to celebrate National Science Day on Wednesday, Ramchandra explained the impact of urbanization on Nature and said that the governments concerned should ensure that other cities do not become like Bengaluru, Mumbai or Delhi which have substantially lost water bodies and green cover at the cost of infrastructure development. There can and should not be any opposition to development, but the planners should make sustained efforts to maintain the ecosystem, he said.
 
 In Bengaluru, Ramchandra said, there is only one tree for seven persons. Ideally, there should be at least eight trees per person. “The garden city has become a garbage city,” he added. The Nature has been giving enough hints to stop wanton destruction of trees and water bodies. Floods in Uttarakhand and Chennai, and drought in Kerala are clear indications of the climatic changes, he added.
 
 In his address,  , director of CSIR-Neeri, said that “One need not be a scientist to speak as the grim situation on the green front is clearly visible.”
