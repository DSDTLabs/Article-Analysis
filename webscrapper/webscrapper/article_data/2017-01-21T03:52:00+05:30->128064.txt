Panaji: A people centric map, which indicates each and every detail like the ward, the panchayat and the person in charge of that landscape, etc. is the need of the hour for Goa, said former chief town planner, government of India, Edgar Ribeiro. He was speaking at a conference on ‘Changing Climates: Evolving Landscapes’ on Friday. “Besides mapping different zones and areas, there is a need to map wards and village areas as well. Also, each of the wards has a councilor and each of the panchayats has a panch. They should be accountable for what goes on in the area. Yet, parliamentarians and law makers do not take them much into confidence while preparing a map. There is a huge disconnect,” Ribeiro said. He further added that leaders have their own agenda when it comes to mapping areas in Goa. “An accountable ward councilor is what we require for our wards. But in Goa maps are made according to how the developer or the land owner wants them. Also, politicians don’t want Goa to be mapped because they can then take decisions through files. These files can always be changed and manipulated,” he said. Ribeiro also said that citizens are left frustrated since not all of them are aware who the agents of actions are in their jurisdiction. The elaborate mapping will therefore bridge this gap between councilor/panch member and citizens.
