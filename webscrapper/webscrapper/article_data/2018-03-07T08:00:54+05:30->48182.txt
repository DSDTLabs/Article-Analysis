LUCKNOW: Once Metro rail starts plying on North-South corridor by April 2019, people will also get to commute on much smoother roads below the corridor.   (LMRC) has proposed to restore all broken roads and infrastructure that got damaged during the construction of Metro. LMRC will soon float a tender, worth Rs 22 crore, for repair of all damaged roads along the Metro route. The N-S corridor runs from   to Munshipulia Crossing. 

 Since about 8.5 km priority stretch from   to Charbagh has been commissioned with the road getting repaired early last year, the new tender will not include this stretch. Officials said, "The tender will include repair of roads along the 23 km long N-S corridor minus the 8.5 km priority section. The total length is 14.5 km covering Station, Sachivalaya, MG Marg, University and Faizabad Road."
