GURUGRAM: A woman had a close shave on Friday when her   turned turtle near Rapid Metro’s Sector 53-54 station on  , merely 800-metre from   underpass where a cab rammed into a divider last Friday.

 According to eyewitnesses, the woman apparently lost control of her   when a   suddenly came in front of her, and went on to dash a cab (Tata Indica) and a Honda City from behind. Finally, the SUV hit a divider and overturned, disrupting traffic flow for some time.
 
 While the woman sustained minor injuries, the drivers of the Tata Indica and the Honda City escaped unhurt.
 
 Police said the woman, a resident of DLF 4 area, was going towards Sikanderpur from Sector 56 in her Honda CRV around 4pm. 
 
 Later, traffic cops reached the spot and removed the SUV, which was badly damaged, from the road and streamlined vehicular movement. A senior police officer said the woman was taken to hospital, where doctors discharged her after first aid. No FIR was filed because neither the woman nor the drivers of the two cars damaged in the accident filed any complaint with the police.
 
 “We reached the spot after receiving a call from a commuter. All the three drivers were found safe,” said head constable Anil Kumar.
 
 Inspector Arvind Dahiya, SHO of Sector 56 police station, said, “Prima facie it seems the accident happened due to a cow. The woman and the two drivers amicably resolved the issue among themselves.”
 
 On May 18, an Uber cab driver had a narrow escape after his car rammed into a parked tractor and then hit a divider near Genpact Chowk underpass. According to the 30-year-old cab driver, he was heading towards Sector 56 from   at 7.30 am when the accident happened. He told cops that he had fallen asleep while driving and woke up when his car, a white WagonR, hit a tractor near Genpact Chowk.
