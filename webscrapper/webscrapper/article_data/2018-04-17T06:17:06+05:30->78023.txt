GURUGRAM: A new   insulated   (GIS) has been operationalised in Sector 57 by power transmission company Haryana Vidyut Prasaran Nigam (HVPN). It is touted as the state’s first departmentally commissioned GIS sub-station. It was built to supply power to   ( ) lines that extended into the city and Rapid Metro.

 GIS high voltage substations’ advanced electrical engineering requires a larger investment, but their sealed technology means lower installation and maintenance costs.
 
 The sub-station was supposed to be built by a company called Isolux Ingenieria which was blacklisted internationally, thus leaving the work midway in October last year. The HVPN then decided to deploy its own manpower and technology to get the sub-station constructed.
 
 “This is a 220 kV GIS sub-station that was to be built by a company which was blacklisted internationally due to some reasons. It left the work midway last October but the project was very important for us. This substation would not only supply power to the DMRC but also to the Rapid Metro. Besides, it is meant to supply power to 66 kV sub-stations in sectors 68, 38 and 35,” said Anil Yadav, superintending engineer, HVPN. “This substation alone will add 100 mega-volt ampere of additional capacity to Gurugram city,” he added.
 
 Officials said the project has been completed at a cost of Rs 40 crore. “We instructed our staff to do it themselves. Normally we don’t do such big projects. We outsource them because of amplitude of manpower and technical input it needs. It was a tough job for us and with its completion it has become Haryana’s first departmentally commissioned GIS substation,” Yadav said.
