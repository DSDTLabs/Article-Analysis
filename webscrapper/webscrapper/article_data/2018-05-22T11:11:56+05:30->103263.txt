Director   was in for a rude shock 
 

 Aditya, who’s known to be a calm and composed person, wasn’t okay with behaviour from the restopub’s end and wanted to know exactly why they were treated like that. He added, “After almost two years I lost my cool. What happened with us was bizarre and embarrassing. I would have agreed if there were any dress code issues but this wasn’t the case. Right in front of our eyes, four other guys were let in but the lady at the gate had an issue with us. I also asked her to call the manager of the restopub to have a word with him, but she refused to call him, saying that I should only speak to her and she won't call over the manager. She also called the bouncers and asked us to leave the premises. I never expected such rude behaviour from a well-known restopub’s official.”
 
 On contacting  , a senior official from The Grid, today morning, he said, “I heard of this incident but all I can say that if we find anyone suspicious, we do not allow them to enter. I wasn’t present at the restopub yesterday so I need to go to office and check the CCTV footage and also hear the conversation between them the group and the PR manger. We have everything recorded and also have a microphone attached to the CCTV. I will know what exactly happened last night.”
 
 Sushmita Ghosh, PR manager, The Grid, said, “We have a protocol at our restopub and only allow standard people. Whatever happened yesterday is recorded with us and I cannot give out any details unless I’m instructed by our general manager”
