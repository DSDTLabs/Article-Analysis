LUDHIANA: A 16-year-old boy has committed suicide by hanging himself in his house following alleged pressure from his relatives to marry a minor girl against his wishes. Moreover, after hearing the news of his suicide, the minor girl too jumped off the second floor of her house from the rooftop on Tuesday afternoon, sustaining severe injuries. She is now undergoing treatment in hospital.

 According to information, the boy and the girl are relatives. The boy’s brother said their family belonged to Bihar, and his younger brother came to Ludhiana three months ago. The girl is a relative of his wife. He alleged his in-laws were pressurizing his brother to marry the girl, but the young boy was reluctant. He also alleged his in-laws had threatened his brother and approached a cop to pressurize him.
 
 He further said: “They had taken my brother to the police station, where some officials threatened to trap him in a forgery case if he did not marry the girl. Since then, my brother was mentally disturbed. On Tuesday, he hanged himself with hook from the roof. I came to know about it in the afternoon, when I came home for lunch.” 
 
 On the other side, as soon as the minor girl — who was believed to have a liking for the boy — jumped off the second floor of her house after hearing the news of the boy’s suicide. She was rushed to hospital, and is stated to be in a serious condition.
 
 Meanwhile, a police official has denied all the allegations levelled by the family of the deceased. He said: “If both the girl and boy were minor, how could the police push them to get married?” He added that both had an affair and wanted to marry each other. But as they were minors, the families were against their marriage, following which the boy ended his life.
