NEW DELHI: The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that BS-VI   would be made available in 17 of the 23 districts of the National Capital Region and in Agra from April, 2019, a year before the less polluting fuel is to roll out for the entire country. It, however, said it was not possible to provide the fuel to other 12 major cities as suggested by the court before the rollout date.

 As BS-VI fuel has been made available in all retail outlets of the national capital (NCT) from April this year, the apex court had asked the Centre to explore the possibility to ensure its supply to the entire National Capital Region and 12 other metro cities as was done by the government while enforcing BS-IV norm in the country in 2010 to check the rising levels of vehicular pollution. 
 
 Responding to the court’s suggestion, the Centre said it had held consultations with oil marketing companies(OMCs) to explore the possibility of introducing BS-VI fuel in   and 13 other metro cities from April 2019, but it was told that this is not feasible. 
 
 “It is submitted that as far as NCR is concerned, public sector OMCs have said it has been found feasible to introduce BS-VI fuel in phases in 17 of 23 districts and two districts adjoining NCR, ahead of pan-India schedule of April 1, 2020. However, it is not feasible to supply fuel in Bhiwani, Rohtak, Sonepat, Panipat, Jind and Karnal districts in NCR,” the Centre said in its affidavit.
 
 “With respect to the status and feasibility of introduction of BS-VI fuel in 12 cities, the public sector OMCs, in consultation with Reliance India Ltd and Essar Oil, have informed that the supply of the fuel is feasible only in the city of Agra out of 12 cities, ,” the affidavit said.
