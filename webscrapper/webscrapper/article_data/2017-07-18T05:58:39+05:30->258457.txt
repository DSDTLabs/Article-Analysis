KOLKATA: Actor   on Monday moved a bail plea before the   district and sessions court. The court will hear the petition on July 20.Vikram is remanded in prison till July 24.

 According to sources, in the petition, Vikram has strenuously argued against the circumstances leading to his arrest early on July 7.The petition argues that 304 IPC charges were added by police on May 30. He had filed for anticipatory bail in the Calcutta high court on June 5. Police found no reason to arrest him in the next month and only did so after the high court, on July 6, fixed the case for hearing.
 
 Police, however, indicated they will oppose the bail plea. Police claims Vikram had been evading calls and didn't comply with the bail conditions to cooperate with police. He was also not found in his ho me by the cops. Police say they have enough evidence to implicate the actor for culpable homicide and bail at this point could impact the probe which is not yet complete.
