SURAT: Police in south   have accelerated process to attach properties of the bootleggers from   booked under Prohibition Act in Gujarat following the Gujarat high court refusing to quash FIRs against them.

 Over 160 people booked in one or more prohibition cases have been avoiding arrest since 2008. 
 
 “It is a big achievement for police in south Gujarat that the demand of the accused booked in the prohibition cases was rejected by the HC. The judgement is a moral booster for us since police is doing good work to arrest the accused,” said Shamsher Singh, IGP, Surat range.
 
 Two special investigation and monitoring committees ( ) headed by Nirlipt Rai, superintendent of police, Surat, and Sunil Joshi, superintendent of police, Valsad, were formed by Singh in February to investigate 200 cases in which arrest of around 160 bootleggers was pending. 
 
 The SIMCs have approached court to declare the accused as absconder under criminal procedure code (CrPC) section 70. After declaring them absconders, now police have started process to attach their properties as per the law.
 
 Police have put up the notices at residence of the accused in Daman. Valsad police have started process to attach the properties in 36 cases while in Surat, Navsari and Tapi districts out of 11 cases the process has been initiated in four cases.
 
 “The accused argued in court that there is no prohibition law in Daman but police investigations has established that they are involved in the crime by helping the bootleggers based in Daman. They are not permitted to sell more than six units of liquor to an individual but police caught truckload of liquor being sent to Gujarat. Further, they don’t maintain required records to carry out the illegal activity,” said Singh.
