KOCHI: ' ', a mural painting by P K Sadanandan which is on display at   2016 will soon inspire the students of Aided   (AMUPS) in Malappuram. The artwork will adorn the covers of notebooks designed by Art by Children (ABC) which will be distributed to 2,000 students in the school in the next academic year. The portion of the painting which shows the story of   will be used to illustrate the cover page of the notebooks. 

 "There is a reason for choosing the Naranath Bhranthan story for the cover image as he crossed set boundaries and borders without caring about what people thought of him. Moreover, he was a philosopher. Children should know of him and learn about him," said Sadanandan.
 
 He added the story of Parayi Petta Pantheerukulam and their characters were significant even now which should be taught to children to bring social integrity. "Every student today uses a minimum of seven notebooks every year. If we print different artworks and introduce different artists through such books, that is a considerable art education effort. We can even introduce artists according to age groups," said Manu Jose who heads the ABC programme. He added that though some schools were already bringing out notebooks designed for their students, the pictures were limited to annual day gatherings or committee meetings.
 
 The inside front jacket of the notebook would carry a short biography of the artist whose work is displayed on the cover page, the rear cover would have the image of the wall art's evolution.
 
 The artist said that the initiative was a novel way to introduce the mural style of painting as well as our folklore to the students. 
 
 "Promoting art education at different levels has become one of the  's primary concerns. Launching a specially designed notebook cover is an engaging way to attract students and make them aware about art practices," said   secretary Riyas Komu at the function.
