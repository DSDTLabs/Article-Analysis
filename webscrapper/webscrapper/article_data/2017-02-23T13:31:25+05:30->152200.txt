PATNA: DG (vigilance)   has advised the district SSPs and SPs to evolve a mechanism for ensuring a more effective control over their police stations and SHOs to  .

 Addressing a function organised to mark the beginning of   celebrations on the Bihar Agriculture Management and Extension Training Institute premises on Wednesday, Kumar underlined the need to check corrupt practices of the state’s men in khaki. 
 
 “The state government has 42 departments, and the maximum number of complaints are made against the police department. At least one-fourths of the government officials trapped in graft cases are policemen,” the state vigilance police chief said.
 
 Bihar Police Building Contraction Corporation’s DG- cum- chairman  , who was the chief guest at the function, said police officers should concentrate on investigation with honesty, professional integrity, patience and dedication so that accusing fingers were not raised at them.
 
 DG (training) K S Dwivedi also expressed concern over the functioning of police at district level. “Inventory records for vehicles and arms and ammunitions are not maintained properly. A single inspection is done every year and sometimes police do not even know which weapon was issued to whom and when,” he said, adding police week celebrations are aimed at organisational development.
 
 ADG (CID) Vinay Kumar regretted that police have almost forgotten the practice of gathering intelligence through informers at ground level. “Taking help of electronic gadgets is okay, but the traditional practice of manual intelligence gathering must also be revived,” the ADG said.
 
 The SSPs and SPs from most of the districts attended the inaugural function. The celebrations, to continue till February 27, will include events at which National Investigation Agency and Intelligence Bureau officers will hold sessions on terrorism, cyberattack, community policing, organised crime, illegal arms manufacturing and crime against women, among other things.
