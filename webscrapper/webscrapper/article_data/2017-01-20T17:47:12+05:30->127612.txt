NEW DELHI: The outgoing President Barack   wrote an emotional public letter thanking Americans and encouraging them to participate in "daily acts of citizenship."

 "Before I leave my note for our 45th president, I wanted to say one final thank you for the honor of serving as your 44th," the outgoing commander-in-chief wrote. "Because all that I've learned in my time in office, I've learned from you. You made me a better president, and you made me a better man."
 Obama recalled low points - like the 
  - and high points - like the 
  - during his presidency. 
 
 He also urged the American people, regardless of political affiliation, to commit themselves to the "joyous 
  ."
 
 "I've seen you, the American people, in all your decency, determination, good humor and kindness. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I've seen our future unfolding," he said.
 
 "All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into that work - the joyous work of citizenship. Not just when there's an election, not just when our own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime."
 
 Obama has said he will remain engaged in issues he cares about in his post-White House life.
 
 "I'll be right there with you every step of the way," he wrote. "And when the arc of progress seems slow, remember:   is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word 'We.' 'We the People.' 'We shall overcome.'"
 
 "Yes, we can," he added.
 
 He also made some subtle digs at the President-elect in referring to issues on which they are divided. He spoke of the success of his Obamacare health scheme, which the President-elect has vowed to undo. And he mentioned that even young children reminded us of our "obligations to care for refugees."
