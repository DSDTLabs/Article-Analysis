AMARAVATI: The   government is mulling a cap on the number of visits made by individual devotees of   to the   (TTD).

 The quota system, which could be a first for any temple in the world, is being proposed as many devotees visit the temple a number of times every month, thereby straining the arrangements made by the management.
 
 Addressing the media on Monday, endowments minister P Manikyala Rao said that many devotees visit the temple twice or thrice in a month, causing problem to those who come for darshan once in while or a year. He said they will seek public opinion on the matter.
  
  
 Rao said the government is inviting suggestions from the devotees, media, and the public on this issue. The minister said that about 70,000 devotees take the Lord’s darshan every day, and that they are trying introduce more changes in the online system. Rao had earlier also hinted that the TTD is mulling introduction of ‘one darshan per year’ system. The government is trying to use technology to facilitate more devotees take the darshan of the Lord.
 
 The idea of introducing quota for darshan first surfaced in the united Andhra Pradesh, when N   was the chief minister. 
 
 A proposal was made, and a preliminary study was also conducted. The proposal is still on paper, even as the TTD has been slowly increasing the online quota for darshan .
 
 Rao said that apart from TTD, the endowments department is formulating a plan to see that at all temples, devotees can take darshan within 30 minutes. At present, there are about 50,000 devotees who are allowed to take the darshan at the temples at free of cost. Now, efforts are on to increase this number to 1.5 lakh.
 
 The government is also mulling to change the name of endowments department as Andhra Pradesh Dharmadaya Deva Sakha. 
 
 He also assured that the government will take steps to provide employment to medically fit candidates on compassionate grounds in the department.
