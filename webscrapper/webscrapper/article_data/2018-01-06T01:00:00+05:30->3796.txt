MUNGER:   workers engaged for cleanliness work in the municipal corporation area by an NGO demonstrated before the office of the corporation on Friday and paraded through the main thoroughfares of the town shouting slogans against the NGO and demanding direct employment through the corporation.

 One of the general secretaries of the Nagar Nigam-NGO Safai Mazdoor Karamchari Sangh Heera Raut led the demonstration. 
 
 The striking sanitation workers with banner and placards also demanded a fixed payment from the corporation. 
 
 Municipal commissioner Shyamal Kishore Pathak said that without proper advice from the state government, the corporation was not in a position to accept the demand of the sanitation employees who are on strike for the last three weeks. Meanwhile, the corporation had already issued tenders for hiring new NGOs who can engage ‘safai karmacharis (sanitation workers)’ and out of a dozen NGOs, four have been shortlisted. “Three of them will be selected,” said the mayor.
