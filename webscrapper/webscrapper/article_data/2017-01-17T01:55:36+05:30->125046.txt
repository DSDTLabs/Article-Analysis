Gurgaon: A team of Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) officials were at the receiving end of ire of locals when they visited Dhani Chiter Sain village on Sunday to register a   case. 

 The team, led by the sub-divisional officer Bhagirath Lodha, reached the village around 6.45am and tried to register a power theft case against a resident, Om Prakash. 
 
 “The officials wanted Om Prakash’s son to sign the Line Loss 1 document, pertaining to power theft, when their neighbour, Shyotaj, intervened and asked Krishna (Om Prakash’s son) to not to sign the document.
