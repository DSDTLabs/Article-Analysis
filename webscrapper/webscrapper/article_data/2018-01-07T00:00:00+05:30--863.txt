I’m a sardarni with very ‘heavy duty’ sardarni genes. I love eating, and the sinful food on my lips would simply settle on my great Punjabi hips. My mum has “healthy” hips. My grandmother had the same. There was no reason, why I shouldn’t have carried on the tradition. And I did for a while. Quite happily too – for all my adolescent life, and well into 12 years of my career in entertainment! In 2008, I was part of an action-based reality show, I wanted to be superfit and strong. Hence, I got down to the serious business of getting fit. 

 It was the starting point. I never looked back. Being healthy and in good shape became of utmost importance to me. How I really changed was when I broke my foot. The first thought that crossed my mind was “how will I exercise?” An operation later, I found myself taking membership of a club only because of its swimming pool; 6 weeks of rehab later, I found my way back to weights and cardio. I became a 5k runner after that injury. When I was 38, I got pregnant. From a happy weight of 52 kg, I was up to 74 kg at the time of delivery. Six months later, I got back to my pre-pregnancy weight. I ran 2 half marathons. 
 
 It is now, in my 40s, that I am my strongest and fittest self. I have found a way of eating and exercising that I could sustain and live with. I exercise 5 times a week. But I like to mix it up. It’s either 90 minutes gym time, or 1.25k of swimming, or a 10k run, or if I have no access to a gym, then just a 40-minute intense bodyweight workout. I have no trainer. I am extremely self motivated and design my workouts myself. 
 
 I start my every morning with utmost gratitude for the amazing work and opportunities that I get. Every day I try to be the best version of myself.
