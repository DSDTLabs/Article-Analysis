KOTTAYAM: The   (CSDS) leaders alleged that the CPM is scared of the growth of the CSDS in   Addressing a press conference here on Monday,   said as a result of this fear, the CPM is unleashing planned attacks on Dalits.

 The CSDS has called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal in Kottayam district to protest against the atrocities against the dalits allegedly by the CPM, DYFI and SFI.
 
 "CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on a visit to Kottayam had told party workers that the base of CPM in the district has become shaky. He had attributed the reason for this for the growth of organisations like CSDS. The atrocities against the dalits in the district began after this speech by Kodiyeri," alleged Suresh.
  
 It was SFI activists who brutally ragged the dalit student O S Avinash in Nattakom Polytechnic College. The dalit MPhil student Vivek Kumaran was also attacked by the SFI activists in MG University college hostel," added Suresh.

There are several other cases reported in Kottayam, Puthuppally, Payyappady and Vaikom where Dalit people including women were attacked. The CSDS has urged the arrest of the culprits in all these cases.
