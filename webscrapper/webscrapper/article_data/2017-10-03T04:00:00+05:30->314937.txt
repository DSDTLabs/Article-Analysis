Vadodara: Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel on Monday announced that the state government will procure groundnut and cotton from the farmers at minimum support price (MSP). He announced this during Chhota Udepur leg of BJP’s Gujarat Gaurav Yatra.

 “This year there is bumper production of groundnut and cotton in the state. If the farmers will not get good price in the market, government will open centers everywhere and procure the farm produce at MSP,” said Patel. He added that the government has always stood by the citizens and solved their issues whether it be road, health and water.
 
 Patel also lashed out at Congress during his public address in Chhota Udepur town. “Congress has done corruption amounting to Rs 12 lakh crore and it is not talking accountability,” he said.
 
 The yatra travelled across the district and then proceeded towards Dahod. On Tuesday, the yatra will pass through Dahod, Mahisagar and Panchmahal districts.
