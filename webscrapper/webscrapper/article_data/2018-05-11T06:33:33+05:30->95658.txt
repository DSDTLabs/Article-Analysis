NEW DELHI: Setting the narrative for 2019 general election, the   government will project the works done during its 48 months at the Centre so far, pitting it against the ‘48-year rule by the Gandhi family’. Sources said “48 months versus 48 years” will be the tagline for the fourth anniversary celebrations of the Modi dispensation.

 
 “One family either directly or indirectly ruled the country for 48 years,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said in February while addressing a public meeting in Puducherry while referring to the governments of Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.
 
 The tagline will be significant in the context of Rahul Gandhi’s statement that he could become the next PM.
 
 Sources said while the government will highlight the works done in the past four years and its ‘no-corruption’ track record, it will attack large-scale corruption during the   rule.
 
 Another focus area will be the campaign to electrify every house after it has achieved the target of providing electricity connection to all villages. Highways ministry’s achievement to push road construction to 28 km a day and free gas connection to the poor under Ujjawala scheme will be some of the major highlights of the anniversary report card.
 
 TOI has learnt that each ministry will prepare small video clips of achievements and carry out publicity campaign. All ministers in the Modi cabinet will visit different states and will hold press conferences to disseminate the Centre’s achievements.
 
 As reported by TOI on Sunday, the government will also put the number of jobs created during its four-year in office to counter Congress’ claim of rise in joblessness.
