KOLKATA: The city started to shiver on Friday as the mercury slid by two-and-half degrees. With the chilly north-westerly blowing in, Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 13.5°C. It is set drop further over the weekend, when the mercury may plunge below 12°C, said the   (RMC). But the warmth could return on Monday under the influence of an approaching western disturbance.

 “The temperature wil drop on Saturday. A further slide is not being ruled out since icy winds from the north are still flowing in. It remains very cold in the neighbouring states of Bihar and Jharkhand. The conditions are bound to be similar in south Bengal,” said GK Das, director, RMC.
 
 An approaching western disturbance, however, could stop the cold spell abruptly end on Monday. “It is now stationed near Jammu & Kashmir. Once it nears Uttar Pradesh, the impact could be felt across the region. It will block the north-westerly and pull the mercury up. Depending on the period it lingers, there could be stray showers. But it’s still too early to predict,” said Das.
