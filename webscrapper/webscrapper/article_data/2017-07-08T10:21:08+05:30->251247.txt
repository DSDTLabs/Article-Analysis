LONDON: At one stage of her third-round clash against crowd-favourite Heather Watson, comeback mom  's remodelled serve appeared to be coming apart. Much like her intricately braided hairdo.

 In the 2 hour 6-minute Centre Court meeting, the Belarusian sent down three aces and eight double faults and dropped three of 13 service games. The average speed of her first serve was just under 100 mph, not quite as brutal as the sun smiling down on SW19. Azarenka, however, came together in stirring fashion in the tenth game of the deciding set. The 27-year-old, playing before a wildly cheering home crowd, in only her second tournament since her return to competition, shut out the fans and her opponent in a game that was more about nerve than serve.
 
 In other third round matches, fourth-seed   put out Russia's Karen Khachanov 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3); seventh-seed   knocked out American   6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4 in a clash of the big servers. Among the women, the second seeded Halep beat China's Shuai Peng 6-4, 7-6 (9-7); fourth-seeded Elina Svitolina of Ukraine was too good for Carina Withoeft of Germany, winning 6-1, 7-5; sixth seeded Johanna Konta put out Greece's Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-1. In an upset result on an outside court eighth-seeded   bowed to the big-hitting young gun Ana Konjuh of Croatia 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-4.
 
 Azarenka, ranked 683, but playing with a protected ranking of No.6, won 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 against a player, who was punching way above her world No.102 status. Sporting a classic A-line dress, Azarenka, moving superbly and striking the ball fiercely, will play the second-seeded Simona Halep in the fourth round on Monday.
 
 The former No.1 said she probably wouldn't have rebuilt her serve if she didn't break from the game for almost a year to have her son Leo. "When the season is 10 months long and you only have two months where you still have to fit in some vacation in that period, I don't think there's enough time to rebuild your game. I'm glad I actually had that," Azarenka said.
 
 
 
 
 The all-Indian pairing of Purav Raja and Divij Sharan went down fighting to the seventh-seeded Raven Klassen/Rajeev Ram in a men's doubles second round clash 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-7(8), 10-8.   and Frenchman Edouard Roger-Vasselin too bowed out to British wildcard pair of Ken and Neal Skupski 6-7(8), 3-6, 7-6(5), 3-6 on Friday.
