Rajkot: A speeding utility vehicle mowed down a 65-year-old man on the new 150-feet Ring Road on the outskirts of Rajkot late evening on Friday.

 According to university police station officials, the deceased was identified as Karsan Lokhil, a resident of Munjka village. Police sources said that on Friday afternoon, some people spotted a utility vehicle lying turtle on the new 150-feet Ring Road near Munjka and rushed to help them. However, the vehicle driver and others escaped from the spot after it was brought back on its wheels. But they did not reveal that they had mowed down an elderly person.
 
 Karsan Lokhil had left his residence on Friday afternoon to visit his farm but did not return until late night. So, his family members went out in search for him. They found him dead in the shrubs by the roadside. Some of the people who had gone to search for Lokhil realized that he might have been run over by the vehicle that was lying overturned near the village. However, some of them had clicked the photos of the overturned vehicle which they supplied to the police. Cops have lodged a complaint on basis of the vehicle number that was visible in the photographs.
