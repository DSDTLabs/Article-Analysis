VISAKHAPATNAM: The district administration plans to set up around 200 mobile towers in the rural areas including a major portion of   to curb   movement as well as address various other issues. 

 “We need to address several issues besides the Maoist menace such as establishing a communication channel in tribal welfare schools and various departments in Visakha Agency and other mandals,” district collector Pravin Kumar told TOI.
 
 Around 10 mobile towers were set up in the agency in the past two years of which some of them were set up near police stations or outposts at   and Rudakota.
 
 The union government had given a nod to setting up mobile towers in naxal-infested states in 2013. When service providers expressed fears about Maoist attacks,   cops had come forward to provide space in their police stations in Visakha Agency and other districts like   and East Godavari. Till last year, BSNL completed installation of around 2,200 mobile towers in Maoist-affected areas of around 10 states at an estimated cost of Rs 3,570 crore. The network connected 12,700 villages with around 40 lakh mobile connection in 90 districts of 10 states.
 
 “The mobile towers are needed to implement bio-metric attendance system and web-casting. Now, the district administration is chalking out plans to set up mobile towers wherever the need is more,” the collector said.
