Surat: The contentious issue of re-leasing the SMC land at very frugal rate will come up for discussion in the standing committee on Thursday. On one hand,  ,000 sq metre of Surat Textile Market (STM) land to be released at throwaway prices,  , SMC is thinking of charging according to the provisions of Land Disposal Act 2002, which will earn the civic body about Rs 35 crore as rent on yearly basis. 

 In 1967, SMC leased 24,435 sq metre of land to the STM Housing Society for textile market. Then the rent of the space was decided as Rs 2.10 per sq metre. Now, as the 50-year lease period is over, the society has asked for the extension of lease for another 50 years and offered the rent as Rs 57.57 per year per sq metre. 
 
 At present, the jantri rate for this place is Rs 52,250 per sq meter. Whereas the market rate of this land is at least 2.5 times that of jantri rate . Today the market rate in this textile market area of land in prime locality like the STM is Rs 1.25 to Rs 1.5 lakh per sq meter. 
 
 “According to the old agreement, lease of 50 years got over on April 19, 2018. Now, we will be working on provisions of Land Disposal Act 2002. We will decide what needs to be charged as rent per year for this SMC land,” said standing committee chairman Rajesh Desai. 
 
 “This is purely commercial activity that they have been doing there since past 50 years, and so we have given them a second option of buying the land at one go from SMC at decided price, which will be near to the actual market price. If they don’t go for that, they will be paying the rent as per the present day norms,” a senior SMC official said. 
 
 Another standing committee member said, “We are looking at about 15% of the market value as the rent per year for SMC, with the first priority to existing tenants. So if the market value is decided at 15-20% less than the projected value of Rs 350 core and nearby, the market value can be around Rs 300 crore and 15% of that can work up to Rs 40-45 crore and nearby.” 
 
 However, it remains to be seen if the rulers of BJP are able to take this critical decision at a time when SMC faces cash crunch on one hand and textile traders are fighting the Goods and Servie Tax battle with government on the other hand.
