Amritsar:   police were in a tizzy after three persons in a car jumped a barrier near the Indo-Pak border under suspicious circumstances, abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot in Bamiyal sector on Tuesday night.

 Narot Jaimal Singh SHO Bharat Bhushan informed TOI on Wednesday that on Tuesday night a suspected vehicle was coming from Gurdaspur, which didn’t stop at a police barrier put up at Baharampur and instead sped away. He said that as soon as Narot Jaimal Singh police got the information about the suspected car, a police party chased it but its three occupants abandoned it near Makhanpur village close to Bamiyal and fled. Makhanpur is about 6 km from the international border.
 
 Pakistani terrorists, who had stormed the Dinanagar police station of Gurdaspur district in July 2015 and the Pathankot Air Force station in January 2016, had entered India from Bamiyal sector. SHO Bhushan stated that the police carried out search operation in the villages but didn’t find the suspects. Ruling out any terrorist angle, Pathankot SSP V S Soni stated that the police had identified the accused and soon they would be in the police net, adding that it was a case of snatching.
 
 The Mahindra Scorpio was forcibly taken from Vijayanagar in Sambha district of Jammu and Kashmir and had a fake registration number plate. The police later found the vehicle’s original registration number and other papers from the car. Asked whether there was a possibility of suspects crossing over to Pakistan, BSF inspector general (  frontier) Mukesh Goel said that the force was on high alert to look into such a possibility.
