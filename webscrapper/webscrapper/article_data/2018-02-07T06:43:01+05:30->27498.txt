AHMEDABAD: The   (NCDRC) has rejected an appeal by   demanding Rs 1 lakh compensation from a   and a local beauty product store after the   caused reaction leading to postponement of her marriage proposal and cancellation of her Singapore tour a decade ago.

 Earlier, two consumer courts in Gujarat had rejected her demand, which led her to approach the NCDRC.
 
  
  According to Khambhatta’s complaint, she had purchased a moisturising face cream Happyderm from a local store Lalit Beauty Centre in 2007. She had applied the same on her face and immediately thereafter suffered from severe allergic reaction. There was burning, redness and rashes. She had undergone unbearable pain and itching, due to which she needed heavy medical treatment.
 
 When she called the store, she was offered a compensation of Rs 25,000, which she refused and later dashed off a legal notice to the store as well as to L’Oréal. Finally, she sued the cosmetic company and the store.Her claims were contested by the store owner and L’Oréal. They termed Khambhatta’s claim that she was offered Rs 25,000 compensation a got-up story. They told the court that the cream’s samples conformed to the standards when tested in a laboratory in Germany. After perusing records, the NCDRC said, “It is seen from the cash memo that the bill No. 838 is for a Maybelline product and not of L’Oreal and nowhere does it mention that moisturising cream was the product purchased. In fact, the cash memo mentions ‘camp’.” tnn
