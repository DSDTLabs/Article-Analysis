Ludhiana: Candidates to various posts of the District Bar Association (DBA) have been organising   to woo voters. The candidates for posts including president, vice-president, secretary, finance secretary, joint secretary with the exception of those contesting for executive members posts are organising such parties.

 “We have organised two such parties including lunch get together for lady members of DBA apart from a tea party. The purpose of these functions was to put forth my achievements during my tenures as Bar president and my agenda for the future. Also apart from meeting the members face to face, such functions enable us to develop social contacts,” said Vijay B Verma, candidate for the president’s post of DBA. The candidates say that the parties do enable them to gauge the mood of voters.
 
 “I organised a tea party on March 26 which was attended by around 500 advocates. The main purpose of organising the party was to talk to the voters at one place. However I could also gauge the response to my candidature,” said Mandeep Singh Sidhu, a candidate for the secretary’s post. He added that apart from other issues like more chambers for lawyers, if elected he will push for making NOC (no objection) certificate for the clients from previous lawyers of the case mandatory so that there is nothing outstanding to him from client.
