GURUGRAM: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has directed the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) to implement the graded response action plan in the city to improve air quality this  .

 The graded response system, prepared by the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA), charts out an action plan to be taken by all departments, including traffic police, civic bodies and pollution control board when the concentration of pollutants, especially particulate matter, reach a certain level.
 
 “CPCB has directed us to implement the graded response system. The system gives out a plan on what to do to keep air pollution under control and how to tackle an emergency situation. I think it is the right time to gear up to deal with air pollution as Diwali is hardly a month away. Also, weather conditions are getting adverse,” said an official of HSPCB in Gurgaon.
 
 As per the system, authorities have to ensure mechanised sweeping, sprinkling of water on roads, smooth flow of traffic, closure of brick kilns, ban on crop burning, ban on firecrackers and enforcement of pollution under control (PUC) norms.
 
 Talking about the importance of the graded response system, Niranjan Raje, a former EPCA member, said, “The system puts various agencies, stakeholders and departments on the job to gear up for winters and Diwali season when air pollution levels become very high. It is a well laid out plan to make sure we prepare for the high levels of pollution and minimise their impact.”
 
 The district administration has already ordered all brick kilns that don’t use eco-friendly zig-zag technology to close down for at least four months to bring down rising air pollution levels in Gurgaon. There are 101 brick kilns in the district. However, not even a single one has zig-zag technology installed.
