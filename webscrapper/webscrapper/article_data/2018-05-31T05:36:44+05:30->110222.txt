CHENNAI: Two construction workers died and two others were injured when a precast concrete slab fell on them at a building under construction in   on Wednesday evening.

 At least 10 other workers escaped unhurt. The police questioned the site safety supervisor and sought copies of the building permission licence and other documents from a Bengaluru-based firm that is constructing the building.
 
 The deceased, who police identified as Raja, 30, of Tiruvannamalai, and S Gunasekar, 23, of Nannilam near Thiruvarur, were working on the second floor of the building on East Spur Tank Road when the incident occurred. The bodies were sent for autopsy to Kilpauk Medical College and Hospital where P Manikandan, 27, of Vilva Nagar in Cuddalore and C Arul, 25, of Villupuram were also taken. Arul was later referred to the Government General Hospital.
 
 The workers had been staying at a makeshift tent near the work site. Around 10 people were at the spot when the police arrived. A team of fire and rescue services personnel removed some of the debris and cordoned off the spot, including the police and media.
 
 Ranjitha Mary, a journalist who lives in the apartment building adjacent to the construction site, said she saw Gunasekar, one of the injured men, thrown into her compound. “We informed the 108 ambulance service but after about 10 minutes I took the man in my car to the hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival,” she said.
 
 Additional commissioner of police M C Sarangan, deputy commissioner of police S Rajendran and Kilkpauk assistant commissioner of police G Harikumar visited the site. A Coimbatore-based chain of restaurants plans to set up a restaurant in the three-storey building, a police officer said.
