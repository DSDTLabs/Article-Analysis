BENGALURU: “It was around 10.30pm and we were about to leave Farzi Cafe when a man wearing half coat and jubba stumbled against my fractured right leg. With pain, I requested him – ‘Brother, please see and walk’. Irked by my words, the man shouted, ‘You know who I am? I am son of local MLA Haris. Who are you to tell me, you b*****d. I am   Haris. Kiss my shoe and say sorry. Or else, I shall kill you,” L Vidvat, who was assaulted allegedly by   and his friends, said in a statement recorded in the chargesheet.

 Vidvat, son of a businessman, was allegedly thrashed by Mohammed Nalapad Haris and friends in Farzi Cafe on the night of February 17, 2018.
 
 Central Crime Branch (CCB) cops probing the case recently submitted the chargesheet to a local court, naming   as the prime accused. The chargesheet, which is around 400 pages, has statements from around 25 persons, including eyewitnesses, Vidvat’s friends, cafe staff,   doctors, among others.
 
  Vidvat has made it clear that it was Nalapad who beat him first. “When I refused to say sorry, Nalapad slapped me on my left chin. Soon, using different objects including ice bucket, knuckle ring and other things, his friends rained blows on me. I managed to escape and came outside. One of Nalapad’s friend took me back and they beat me again. A little later, I was shifted to Mallya Hospital. There too, Nalapad and others attacked me and my brother   when he tried to stop them,” Vidvat alleged.
