 “I ordered an inquiry after the video went viral. Those found responsible have been suspended,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said.

The video shot on a mobile phone camera shows easy accessibility of the liquor den located on first floor of a commercial building. It was operating from an open space covered with plastic sheets.
