MUMBAI: About 73,000 students were wrongly failed in examinations conducted by the University of Mumbai between 2014 and 2016. These students cleared the red after they filed for revaluation. The university charges Rs 500 for revaluation and Rs 100 for a photocopy of answer book.

 Last year, 1.2 lakh candidates of nearly 3.5 lakh who wrote an exam — about one out of three — applied to the university for revaluation, raising a question over the quality of evaluation. During the first half of 2016, of 44,441 who applied for revaluation, 16,934 cleared the exam, revealed an RTI query filed by activist  .
 
 The situation is more confounding for those who don't get revaluation results in time as they have to appear for the supplementary exam. In many cases, revaluation results are declared after students take the supplementary exam. TOI had reported in its edition dated October 7, 2015 about how  's revaluation revenue had jumped 2.5 times in five years. Between 2010 and 2014 revaluation fee rose from Rs 2 crore to Rs 5.6 crore.
 
 “The university should publish a model standard answer paper set and give it to paper-checkers and also publish the same on its website,“ said Durve. “The university should appoint sufficient paper checkers so there is no pressure on them in terms of time. Payment to paper-checkers must be in line with the work. Strict action must be taken against those who err..“ Durve has sought reduction in revaluation fee and demanded that fee be refunded and compensation paid to those who are wrongly failed.
 
 Data procured by Durve shows that, over time, the number of students applying for re valuation has risen steadily .Durve had, in an earlier RTI query, found that in 2012, 14,586 of 68,653 who applied for revaluation had passed. In the first half of 2013, of 43,256 who applied, 10,509 cleared the exam.
 
 A former exam controller said, “As time of evaluation of papers coincides with vacations, many teachers are reluctant to correct papers, thus putting pressure on those who take up.“
