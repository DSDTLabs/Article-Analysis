CHENNAI: A   near the IIT-M campus is violating norms, say residents. They have petitioned the chief minister, demanding relocation of the outlet that is near a medical shop and some educational institutions.

 The outlet, on Sriram Nagar Main Road, is also close to Adyar cancer institute.
 
 A few residents in the area told TOI that customers coming to the outlet were a nuisance, gathering there right from the morning and many coming back through the day.
 
 M Kavitha Prasad, a resident, said that the government should relocate the shop immediately. “The kin of many cancer patients come to the medical store and the drunk men harass women who pass by,'' he said. Last week, there was an incident where some drunk men tried to misbehave with women who wereaccompanying cancer patients to the hospital, a few residents said. The reputed   is located right opposite the road on which the outlet is located.
 
 “No one can enter the medical shop as drunk men are found here all the time. This is the pharmacy closest to the hospital. The authorities should come and see for themselves the nuisance these drunk men create, many urinating in the open. The area around the shop stinks and the authorities are turning a blind eye to the menace. The shop should be closed down immediately , or we will come to the streets to protest," said M Lakshminarayan who lives in the area.
 
 Shop keepers say there is no patrolling by police and that tipsy men had a free run, some of them even lying half naked on the road, making it particularly difficult for women.
 
 Schoolchildren and college students too have been affected, they said.
