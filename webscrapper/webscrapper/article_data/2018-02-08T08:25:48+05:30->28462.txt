HYDERABAD: The junior doctors’ strike at   came to an end on Wednesday afternoon, but not before disrupting medical services for better part of the day. On the third day of strike, over the issue of ‘false allegations’ being levelled against them, doctors continued with their boycott of out-patient and elective services.

 As a result several patients — some of the from far off places — who walked in during the morning hours had to return unattended. And this after waiting at the hospital for hours.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 “I waited for close to two hours before being asked to leave by the security guards. I returned even on Monday without getting any time or date for consultation. I was told that the surgery has to be done at the earliest but I have not been able to meet any doctor,” said Anjum Begum (40) who had come to schedule a fibroid removal surgery.
 
 The strike was called off after the Director of   (DME), Dr Ramesh Reddy, met the junior doctors and requested them to resume duty. “The superintendent (Dr P  ) also apologised and clarified that he levelled no allegation against doctors. Hence we called off the strike,” said Dr  , president,   (Gandhi Hospital unit).
 
 Over 600 junior, PG doctors and house surgeons launched the strike on Monday alleging that the hospital superintendent had falsely charged them for being hand in glove with private labs for testing blood samples. This came a day after Dr Sravan Kumar nabbed two private lab technicians red-handed, at Gandhi, and lodged a police complaint against them. He had even questioned doctors over their involvement in the incident.
