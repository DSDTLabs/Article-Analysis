GURUGRAM: New changes were made in the recently imposed traffic diversions near   on Wednesday. On Sunday night, a sewer line had burst at the Jharsa village crossing near Delhi-Gurgaon expressway. The leakage underground had weakened the patch of the road on the expressway and as a result, it caved in. Following this, the route was diverted. 

 Now, traffic coming from Sector 15 towards Jharsa village will be allowed to take the slip road for a left turn towards Jaipur. Here, only a single lane is allotted. A trial was conducted for it on Tuesday, and a traffic snarl wasn’t observed on any side of Jharsa crossing.
 
 Besides this, vehicles coming from the Delhi side can now take the Jharsa road exit (Exit 9) on NH-8 and travel towards Sector 15 or Jharsa village as both roads are functional. Also, coming from the Jaipur side, traffic can turn left towards Sector 15, but access to Jharsa is blocked.
 
 Similarly, traffic coming from Sector 15 and Jaipur side can turn towards   to go to Jharsa. Vehicles can turn left on Bakhtawar Singh Road towards   hospital. From here, another left turn can be taken from opposite the hospital to reach Jharsa Village.
 
 Traffic coming from Jharsa village and going towards Sector 15 and Delhi will have to take a mandatory left towards Rajiv Chowk. Then vehicles will take a U-turn on the Delhi-Gurgaon expressway before Rajiv Chowk and head to their respective destination. 
 
 “The civic agencies are repairing the road, but it is still not confirmed how long it will take to fix the leakage underground. The caved portion can be only be filled after that. Till then the diversions have been imposed to ensure that those coming from Jharsa village have some mobility,” said  , road safety officer.
