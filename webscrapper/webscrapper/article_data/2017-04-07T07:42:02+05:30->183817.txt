ALAPPUZHA: A Plus-Two student was murdered over a suspected triangular love affair at Neelimangalam near Vayalar late on Wednesday. 

 The murder prompted both the   and   to separately call for a district-wide dawn-to-dusk hartal on Friday. The fronts alleged that 17-year-old Anandu aka Nandu fell victim to political violence, even as investigators said they were suspecting teenage romance had led to the killing.
 
 Police have detained 10 people, including four minors in connection with the murder that took place during the festival of Rajarajeshwari temple at Neelimangalam around 10.30pm. 
 
 Anandu, a student of Rama Varma Higher Secondary School at Vayalar, was allegedly attacked by a 10-member gang while he was returning home. The gang was not armed, police said.
 
 "Head injuries resulted in his death," inspector of Cherthala police circle V P Mohanlal said. "Local residents rushed him to the   here, but he had already died."
 
 Police were suspecting that Anandu, son of Pattanakkad-resident Ashokan, was in a relationship with a girl, who was the love interest of another teen. "This (love affair) could be the motive. They did not intent to murder him," the officer said while ruling out political rivalry could have led to the incident. 
 
 Political parties, however, refused to believe the police version.   leaders alleged that Anandu was an RSS activist, but had been, of late, keeping a distance from the activities of that organization, which ended in his murder.
 
 CPM district secretary Saji Cherian cited the festival of Sree Karthiyayini Temple to exempt Chertahla town from the hartal.
 
 Besides father Ashokan, Anandu leaves behind mother Vimala and sister Athira.
