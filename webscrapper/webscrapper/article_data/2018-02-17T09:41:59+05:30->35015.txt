The English paper was circulated through WhatsApp when the examination was going on but it was done after almost one and half hours after the exam started.

 Despite holding the exam under the surveillance of CCTV cameras, at least 28 candidates were expelled. Two invigilators were also caught by exam authorities for using mobile phones in prohibited exam zones in lower Assam, though Seba is yet to confirm their expulsion. A candidate from Morigaon allegedly committed suicide under exam pressure, while another board examinee,  , died in a road accident at Sonari as he was leaving the exam centre after appearing for the English paper.
