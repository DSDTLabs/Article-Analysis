Acclaimed cinematographer Ramachandra Babu has found his heroine for his upcoming 3D directorial, Professor Dinkan. 

 The filmmaker has roped in   for the role, and she will be romancing   in the movie.
 
  The director tells us, “Namitha is the daughter of a magician, played by its scriptwriter, Rafi. He incidentally trains Dileep’s character in magic tricks from his childhood.” Dileep and Namitha had earlier teamed up for Villali Veeran and Chandrettan Evideya. The filmmaker says that the movie will have a romantic track featuring duo, but that will not be the sole focus of the movie.
 
 “Magic is the central theme of the film, which has a bit of fantasy and is a comedy,” says the director, adding that the film will start shoot from next week in Trivandrum. Apart from the trio, the movie will also have Aju Varghese, Suraj Venjaramoodu and Srinda.
 
 Meanwhile, Namitha is also part of Rafi’s directorial Role Models, which has Fahadh Faasil in the lead. The actress plays a water sports trainer in the film.
