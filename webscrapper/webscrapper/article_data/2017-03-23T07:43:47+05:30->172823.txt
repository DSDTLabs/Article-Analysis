CHENNAI: Two subordinate court orders last week one asking a bail applicant to cut 'seema karuvelam' (prosopis juliflora) trees and the other asking a litigant to fill troughs of   have come under fire from the   which has termed them 'obnoxious'. 

 An Ariyalur court last week granted a petitioner bail, but directed him to cut a specified number of 'seema karuvelam' trees. Then, a court in   asked a person in a poaching case to fill troughs created by the forest department for a month.
 
 Justice P Devadas, calling it an 'obnoxious practice,' said he would never subscribe to such 'odd,' 'onerous' conditions. "The present spree or competition among judges in our state to impose such bail conditions, signals not march of law but an onslaught on human rights and human sentiments," he said. The judge was prompted to make the observations when counsel for a bail petitioner requested him not to lay down conditions such as cutting   for his client.
 
 A person is presumed innocent till convicted, and except the 'accused' tag he/she is a normal person, Justice Devadas said, pointing out that even a convicted person is not denuded of basic human rights.
 
 Asking a man to cut trees in the presence of others will leave an impression in the minds of others that he might be guilty, the judge said, adding, "He is almost punished even before trial."
 
 Courts are not above law. "They are not extra-constitutional authorities on earth which had suddenly descended from the heaven. In a democratic country based on written Constitution, courts exercising sovereign powers of state must do so in accordance with law," Justice Devadas said.
 
  "This kind of odd conditions will be counter-productive. Would-be criminals will be emboldened to commit crimes, cut karuvelam trees, come out on bail from jail and go scot-free. And they will be interested in indulging in further crimes."
