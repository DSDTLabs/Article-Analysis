AHMEDABAD:   MP from Mumbai North, Poonam  , said on Sunday that every Indian woman, including herself, has faced “sexual trouble” or harassment at some stage.

 Speaking at The   at the Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad (IIM-A), Mahajan said that self-pity should not be the response to such experiences.
 
 “I used to take a train to my classes in Versova from   as I could not afford to travel by car at the time. But I did not feel selfpity that someone was looking at me in a disagreeable way. Every woman on this planet, especially in India, has faced that,” Mahan said.
 
 “Every Indian woman has had remarks passed about her or has been touched inappropriately,” she added.
 
 Speaking on the theme ‘Breaking the Glass-Ceiling’, Mahajan said that men can afford mediocrity in politics but women cannot. “Mediocrity does not suit women. We need strength and we have shown that,” said Mahajan, the daughter of the late BJP leader  .
 
 “We connect goddesses to every aspect of life. In some respects, we are ahead of America,” Mahajan said. “They do not have a woman president. But in India, women have assumed the role of President, Prime Minister, defence minister, and chief ministers. These leaders have broken the glass ceiling. It is up to us to continue that tradition. It is up to us not to harbour self-pity. If someone harasses you, slap him and don’t think why he did that.”
