NAVELIM (Goa): A late goal by substitute   guided   to a solitary goal win over Chandigarh in the opening match of the 71st   football tournament on Sunday.

 The all-important goal was scored in the 90th minute when Sannik Murmu split the defence with a through pass to substitute Faiaz who raced down and after entering the box beat the rival keeper   with a low shot to the far corner of the net.
 
 Play was confined to midfield for most part of the match which saw few goal-bound moves.
 
 West Bengal, who had better ball possession in the first half, looked more thrustful in their attack and had the first chance to take the lead but Moirangthem Basanta directed the ball straight to rival keeper Harpritpal Singh in the 15th minute.
 
 West Bengal kept on pressuring and had another chance to forge ahead five minute later but Chandigarh keeper Harpritpal once again came to his side's rescue when he blocked Rana Gharami's stiff shot.
 
 After the change of ends, Chandigarh improved their game by several notches and had a clear chance to score five minute before the end but Amandeep Singh, who was found free inside the box, saw his shot missed the target narrowly.
 
 West Bengal retaliated and scored the winner just before the final whistle.
