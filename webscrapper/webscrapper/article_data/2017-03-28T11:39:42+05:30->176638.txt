NEW DELHI: Kashmir’s senior   leader   refused to retract his criticism of   chief minister Aditya Nath Yogi on Monday.
 
 On Saturday, Supreme Court lawyer Dr Abhishek Atrey had served a defamation notice to   for his tweets about the UP CM on March 19. “Those celebrating #YogiAdityanath should remember that this country is great only because of its diversity, not coz of these bigots,” Nizami had tweeted from his official handle.
  
 “I am not scared and I stand by my words. I will reply to the notice through my lawyer. You cannot force someone to sing songs of your choice. I firmly believe that Yogi doesn’t deserve the position he has got. Had he been face of BJP in UP, the party would have got a drubbing,” Nizami said in a press statement released on Monday.
  
 The Congress leader alleged that he was being targeted for his views on UP CM. “My constitution has given me the right to take on every such individual who propagates hatred and communal bias,” he said.
  
 Nizami’s controversial tweets about Yogi and controversial Islamic preacher Dr Zakir Naik, had triggered social media outrage. “Zakir Naik is being hounded despite no evidence against him.   has cases of murder, riots registered against him. He is made the CM of UP!” he had tweeted.
