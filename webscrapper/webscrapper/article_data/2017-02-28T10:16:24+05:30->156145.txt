SECUNDERABAD: Travel woes of over one lakh people traversing through the Tukaramgate railway crossing may continue for some more time as the state government is yet to release funds for a ' ' (RUB) near the Lalaguda railway station. Once it is constructed, it would benefit commuters from Malkajgiri,  , Lalaguda and Mettuguda.

 In the 2015-16 Railway budget, the central government had sanctioned Rs 29.05 crore to construct the RUB, a drainage system and approach roads.Out of this amount, the Telangana government had to contribute Rs 13.05 crore. But it was only about two months ago that the file reached the   ( ) which is dealing with the project on behalf of the Telangana government as the location falls in its limits.
 
 Since then there has been no progress on it. “The GHMC is dealing with the subject and somewhere it got stuck,“ a source in GHMC told TOI. “A meeting will be convened soon with GHMC Commissioner B Janardhana Reddy to take a final decision,“ he said.
 
 Already the GHMC has identified nearly 50 properties for acquisition of land. The South Central Railway (SCR) would construct the four-lane RUB, but GHMC has to provide the `right of way'. Also, footpaths and stormwater drains have to be put in place, a senior GHMC official said.
 
 “Once we get the financial clearance, tenders will be floa ted to take up work,“ the GHMC official said.
 
 Lakhs of commuters face problems daily during peak hours. “At times we are forced to wait for 45 minutes to an hour at the level crossing,“ said Prashant Reddy, a resident of Malkajgiri.
 
 K Narayana, a resident of Shantinagar and a retired R&B official, said, “Even after the Centre has sanctioned the amount to construct the RUB, the Telangana government's inordinate delay in sanctioning its share has caused a lot of inconvenience to lakhs of commuters.“
