CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Monday asked if the case involving online homestay aggregator Stayzilla could be decided by mediation.

 When the bail application of Stayzilla CEO   came up for hearing before Justice S Bhaskaran, the latter made a passing reference about the charge of breach of trust mentioned in the FIR and asked since it being "breach of trust" arising out of business transaction, could it not be resolved by mediation. He then posted the hearing to Tuesday .
 
 This is Vasupal's third bail attempt--his first plea was rejected by a special court for CCB-CBCID cases at   on March 23.
 
 The second bail petition was rejected by the principal sessions judge here on March 28.
 
 Stayzilla's unpaid dues of Rs 1.6 crore to Chennai-based advertising firm   landed him in trouble, after C S Aditya of the advertising firm lodged a complaint against Vasupal and his partner Sachit Singhi. Aditya alleged that the duo criminally intimidated him when he demanded the refund. The duo is facing charges of cheating, criminal breach of trust and criminal intimidation.
 
 It had been the contention of Vasupal's counsel all along that there was no written contract for services rendered and that it was a civil dispute, whereas the prosecution had argued that it was a clear case of cheating and that a co-accused was yet to be arrested.
