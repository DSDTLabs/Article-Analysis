Vadodara: Two videos of persons giving mock speeches in a booze party sent the BJP into a tizzy on Tuesday. The persons in the videos were allegedly workers of the party and even displayed a party flag during the session.

 The persons seen in the video appearing to be in an inebriated condition are seen acting as if they were addressing a public meeting. Customary welcome of the speakers and their introduction is also done much akin gatherings of political parties.
 
 It was this session of introductions that led to the identification of the persons in the videos. Interestingly, with a burning cigarette in hand, one of the seemingly drunk persons in the video even gives a sermon to youth. Others too are heard trying to guide the ‘society’.
 
 One of the persons brings a BJP flag and puts it inside a plastic soda or cold drink bottle. The flag is soon removed from the table. A liquor bottle is also visible in a video and one of the persons sitting around a table is seen trying to get even the last drops out of it.
 
 BJP city unit general secretary Keyur Rokadiya said that the persons were not known to him and did not seem to be very active members. “If they are found to be members of the party, action will be taken against them,” he said.
