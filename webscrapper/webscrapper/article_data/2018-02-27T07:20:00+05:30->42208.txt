Ghaziabad: Three men were arrested on Sunday night for brutally killing 40-years-old   turned businessman   on February 18.

 Fafrana’s neighbour and contractor Rahul, who has at least three murder cases against him, and two of his accomplices were arrested from Modi Nagar area.
 
 Police recovered three pistols and a large number of live cartridges along with a car used in the crime from their possession. The other two accused have been identified as Vivek and Ashu Chauhan. 
 
 The police on Monday said that the fight for supremacy led to the murder of Fafrana.
 
 SP (rural), Arvind Kumar Maurya said, “Both Rahul and Fafrana were planning to contest the next block elections from Bhojpur and the latter had forbidden the former from participating in it. Fafrana had also threatened to destroy Rahul’s advertising business. This infuriated Rahul, so he hatched the murder plan of Fafrana along with his two accomplices. They conducted a recce for one month to understand the movement pattern of Fafrana.”
 
 Fafrana, who ran a brick kiln, was gunned down by unknown car-borne assailants in Mau Khas village of Modi Nagar while he was travelling with his cousin. Police said that his body had received 20 bullet shots.
 
 Maurya added that Rahul was also involved in the murder of a home guard platoon commander in 2010 and a bank employee in Kotwali area in 2013. His accomplice, Vivek was also involved in the second murder. Ashu, however, does not have any criminal case registered against him.
 
 According to police, Fafrana had nearly 15 criminal cases registered against him and was a history-sheeter at Modi Nagar police station. In past, he also held a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head.
