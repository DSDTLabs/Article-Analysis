NEW DELHI: In a bid to promote extra-curricular activities, the   has introduced a once-a-week “bagless day” in its schools.

 SDMC mayor   said one day in a week will be reserved for activities such as quizzes, puzzle-solving and sports, when students will not have to bring their bags to school.
 
 “Under the smart learning programme, we have introduced the concept of a bagless day when students will be encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities. This is an attempt to provide a different module of learning for better performance,” said Sehrawat.
 
 "We are yet to decide the different types of activities on the bagless day. It will be introduced from upcoming academic session,” she added.
 
 There are 581 schools catering to about 3 lakh students under the south corporation. Sources said the north and east corporations were also planning to follow SDMC’s lead in their schools.
 
 “Our focus is mainly on improving the quality of education at SDMC schools. There is a dip in enrollment due to mushrooming of public schools but in the few schools where we have introduced smart learning for children, we have received a good response,” Sehrawat said.
