Noble pledge | St Joseph’s School joins hands with TOI in promoting  

 Chandigarh: More than 200 students joined hands to make a human chain at St Joseph’s Senior Secondary School, Sector 44, here on Thursday, which marked the end of Times Organ Donation Week.
 
 The participants were from Classes XI and XII. With banners and slogans such as “we stand with organ donation”, they created public awareness about the noble cause. The Times of India is part of this initiative with Mohan (Multi-Organ Harvesting Aid Network) Foundation. 
 
 After a straight line, they formed a semi-circle. For the event, Punjabi singer Gulnazar Singh, besides Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital’s executive director Dr Ram Narain and assistant vice-president Shrenik Mehta came over from Mumbai. Gulnazar Singh said: “I would like to pledge my organs for donation after death. I feel honoured to see the enthusiasm today and learn.”
 
 On the progress of organ-donation awareness, Dr Narain said: “This is the fourth good year of our association with TOI in this important initiative. There is a huge gap between the demand and supply or organs. Even though cadaveric donations are happening, the numbers needs to increase.”
 
 St Joesph’s School principal Monica Chawla said: “For maximum awareness, I suggest everyone motivates at least five people in a lifetime to pledge their organs.”
