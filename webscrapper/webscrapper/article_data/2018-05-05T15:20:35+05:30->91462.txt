JAMUI: A photograph of a Pakistani girl was mistakenly published on school stationery meant to promote ' ' and 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' initiative in Bihar's Jamui district.

 Booklets published with the girl's photograph by Patna's Suprabh Enterprises were distributed in all schools in the area.
 
 District Coordinator of sanitation and water Sudhir Kumar called the distribution of notebooks "a mistake".
 
  
  
 In the photograph, the girl can also be seen drawing a Pakistan flag.
 
 The girl's photo is available on portals of several humanitarian organisations engaged in promoting girl's education in Pakistan, including UNICEF.
