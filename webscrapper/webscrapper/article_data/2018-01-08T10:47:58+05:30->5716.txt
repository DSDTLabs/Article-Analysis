Since the Supreme Court on Friday adjourned a petition seeking withdrawal of voting rights given to the nine nominated councillors of Chandigarh  , this will be the first time in the history of the city that none of the nominated councillors will vote in the mayoral election. TOI spoke to  , a   leader and a former elected councillor of Chandigarh MC, who is the petitioner in the case, asking him what he feels about the political repercussions of the development.

 
 
 
 
 This will curtail horsetrading in mayoral election, and bring in transparency.
 
 The development will ensure natural leadership in the MC.
 
 
 
 Parties will think seriously about good candidates, so people will be given enough voices. Also, it will end political corruption. Now, nominated councillors wonâ€™t be members in MC panel too. This will keep them away from financial decisions.
 
 
 
 Yes, I strongly feel that. Also, it is a fact that voting right to nominated councillors was creating hurdles in day-to-day functioning of elected representatives. In the past, nominated councillors were used for political vendetta.
 
 
 
 
 I agree. Chandigarh administration was also using nominated councillors to pass agenda items in  , otherwise not wanted by elected representatives.
 
 
 
 
 My party supported me from the first day. National leaders, like J P   and Aarti Mehra, held a press conference on this issue. In the past, top local leaders Harmohan Dhawan, Satya Pal Jain and Sanjay Tandon submitted a memorandum together to officers of the UT administration to quash voting rights given to nominated councillors
