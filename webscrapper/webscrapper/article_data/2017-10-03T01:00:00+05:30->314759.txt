Actors who indulge in method acting often go that extra mile not only to get into character, but also to stay in it. Sample this — the late Heath Ledger didn’t leave his apartment for almost a month and recorded his eerie thoughts in a diary to play the role of The Joker in 'The Dark Knight'. While shooting for the film 'My Left Foot', Daniel Day Lewis wanted the cast and crew members to feed him during breaks. Reason: He needed to stay in character of a man suffering from cerebral palsy.

 Bollywood actors also adopt interesting ways to play the role to the T.  , who is known to sink his teeth into the roles he essays, decided to literally sniff the character out when he shot for ' '. To perform intense scenes as the anti-hero,   in the period drama, he would apply a rare ittar from Turkey. The woody scent was gifted by a friend, as the actor is fond of collecting unique fragrances.
 
 However, during the course of the shoot, the ittar bottle got lost and couldn’t be procured in record time. So, all that   could do was to remind himself of the powerful fragrance and complete the film’s shoot.
