NEW DELHI: Two more Afghan cities will be connected by direct flights to Delhi this week, the government said on Monday, a move that is expected to further ease trade and commerce between the two countries.

 The cities are  , in Afghanistan’s north, and   in the west.
 
 The inaugural direct flight took off from the Maulana Jalalludin Balkhi airport in Mazar-e-Sharif for   at 10.30am on Monday. Kam Air — a private airline of the Kamgar Group — will operate two flights a week from Mazar-e-Sharif, on Mondays and Wednesdays, and from Herat on Tuesdays and Fridays.
 
 The flight was inaugurated by Mohammad Afzal Hadeed, chairman of the Provincial Council of Balkh province, and Manjish Grover, consul general of India in Mazar-e-Sharif. Grover said there couldn’t have been a better day to start the flight than the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the embodiment of non-violence and peace.
 
 “The consul general said there had been a demand for direct flight to Delhi from Mazar for a long time, and Afghan people in the northern provinces who travel to India for medical treatment will benefit the most. He also felt that this will lead to easier trade and commerce from north   with India as business travellers will find it easier to use this direct connection,” a statement issued by the Indian consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif said.
 
 In June, India and Afghanistan had launched a dedicated air freight corridor. The corridor was launched as Pakistan had been creating hurdles in the transport of goods between India and Afghanistan. Currently,   and SpiceJet operate direct flights from India to Kabul.
