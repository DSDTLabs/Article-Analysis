Panaji: The directorate general of mines safety (DGMS) has asked leaseholders to take appropriate safety measures before closing operations. The instructions were given in light of the Supreme Court order that mining operations in Goa should shut down by March 15. The directorate said that leaseholders who were granted the second renewal in violation of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Goa Foundation case are given time to manage their affairs and may continue mining till March 15 and then stop all operations till fresh mining leases and environmental clearances are granted.  The directorate also said that all mine owners, agents and managers against whom the verdict is applicable are requested to take suitable safety measures as required under regulation 6, regulation 110, and regulation 115 of the Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961, and all other applicable statues as per the provisions of the Mines Act, 1952. Meanwhile, the mines department has said that all leaseholders have been instructed to remove all movable machinery from their lease areas by 1pm on March 15 unless otherwise directed by the office of the regional controller of mines or the regional office of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), Bengaluru, both of which are final authorities concerning mining operations in accordance with provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and rules. The mines director said that from 1pm on March 15, the leases shall be inspected by technical staff of the state mines directorate either independently or together with officials of the Indian Bureau of Mines, directorate of mines safety, forest department, MoEFCC, Goa State State Pollution Control Board, and other bodies.  Recently, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) had decided not to grant consent to operate for the extraction of iron ore that has been redistributed by the mines department. As mining activities were supposed to come to standstill, the directorate of mines and geology had redistributed the extraction limit among operational mines to achieve the 20 MT cap before March 15. The directorate general of mines safety said that all mine owners, agents and managers against whom the verdict is applicable are requested to take suitable safety measures as required under the Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961
