CHENNAI: Even three months after the Madras high court directed Avadi police to conduct preliminary inquiry against  , former managing director of  , the order has not been complied with till date.

 The complaint pertains to discrimination faced by  , former MTC conductor, who filed a series of   petitions todig out violation of communal reservation norms while promoting staffs belonging to SC and ST communities since 2007.
 
 In 2007, no SC/ST driver or conductor was promoted, says replies to RTI query. “Lapses while promoting SC/ST staffs in MTC have been continuing, and those from other communities have been promoted over them,” Kothandam told TOI.
 
 Government records accessed by TOI too revealed that of all the staff belonging to ST communities recruited by MTC, only one was promoted in 2017.
 
 In a bid to dissuade him from unearthing the irregularities, the management transferred him five times, marked him absent for 862days and suspended him for 350 days on various ‘charges’, said Kothandam.
 
 As his complaints were not registered by police, he moved the court. “After the court issued a direction to inquire the alleged discrimination I faced in the last eight years, I was asked by police to give my complaint in writing once again. There was no communication from them after that,” hesaid.
 
 Rejecting this, Avadi police said inquiry had indeed been conducted and reply was sent to him. A senior MTC official responded by stating that though there were lapses in filling ST posts, SCs were recruited in excess.
