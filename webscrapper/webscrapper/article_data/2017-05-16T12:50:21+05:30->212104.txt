Palanpur: As many as 29 cows died after eating green fodder containing castor plant residues at Dod village in Tharad taluka of Banaskantha late on Sunday night. Over 200 cows were affected at the cattle shed run by a private trust some 15km from Tharad town.

 Of the cows that suffered food poisoning 18 died on the spot while 11 others succumbed during treatment at the animal hospital, said district animal husbandry officer S B Upadhyay on Monday.
 
 The poisonous effect of the castor leaves mixed in the fodder came to light when the animals began falling one by one on ground in the cattle shed, he added.
 
 “As we received information, three teams of veterinarians from Tharad, a team from Jalaram Gaushala Bhabhar and a team from Banas Dairy were rushed to the village to start treatment early,” said Upadhyay.
 
 According to Upadhyay, it being a crop harvesting season, some leaves and stems of the castor plants were found lying outside the field and may have got mixed with fodder causing its death. “Primary investigation suggest that the cows ate castor plant which caused food poisoning as we found castor leaves near the field where the fodder is kept,” he added. 
 
 R G Chaudhary, police sub-inspector at Tharad said that so far, no police complaint has been lodged by the cow shed authorities.
