CHENNAI: Daily power cuts have given residents in several parts of the city an unpleasant sneak peek at what is in store this  , with bottlenecks in distribution taking a toll despite the state having a power surplus. 

 
 
  
 
 Though there is enough electricity to meet the demand, problems in feeder lines and   have led to these unscheduled outages.   officials attend to the problems and restore power, which could take a few minutes or sometimes even a few hours. 
 
 Residents of  ,  , Adyar, Mandaveli,  , parts of   and areas in   experience power cuts almost daily. 
 
 “We are aware of the problems faced by residents across Chennai. Almost all the sub-stations are maintained regularly and there is no problem with old or worn out cables. Unscheduled power cuts happen during the summer when the load increases,” said a senior Tangedco distribution official. 
 
 “We are monitoring the load 24/7 based on the demand at each sub-station. If the load suddenly increases in an area, it may lead to tripping of the distribution line. Our workers have to find the spot where the line has been cut and then carry out repairs,” said the official. Such problems will take some time and until then there will be power cuts to prevent workers being electrocuted, he said. 
 
 Officials said the headquarters has received several complaints from consumers who have attempted to raise power-related grievances in vain through the 1912 helpline. “A few days ago, we had a meeting with all assistant engineers (AE) along with the call centre which is managing the complaint number. We asked the AEs to call the number after midnight to check whether there is a proper answer. We will take action if complaints about this continue,” said the official.
