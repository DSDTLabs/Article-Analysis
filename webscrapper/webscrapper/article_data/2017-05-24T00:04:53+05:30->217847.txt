MUMBAI: The transport department has given kaali-peeli   drivers relief till June 30 to instal speed governors in vehicles. TOI had reported on Monday about nearly 4,000 taxis going off the road as the RTO did not renew their vehicle fitness certificates on the grounds that speed governors hadn’t been installed in them. Now, taxi drivers can go back to the RTOs to get fitness certificates. The speed limit for taxis is 80 kmph.

 Union leader A L Quadros said, “We are happy with the relief. But we are opposed to the speed governor rule and have challenged it in the high court. The hearing is scheduled for Thursday.” 
 
 The city has nearly 22,000   plying on the road daily and Quadros pointed out that absence of 18% taxis has affected citizens. “From Wednesday, the taxis whose fitness certificates have not been renewed will go to the four city RTOs in batches. Senior transport officials have assured us that they will clear all the backlog,” he said. 
 
 Quadros alleged that there was a shortage of speed governors. “New devices should be approved by testing agencies like   before rules are issued.” 
 
 According to a source in the transport commissioner’s office, the Centre has taken a decision to amend the motor vehicle rules and make governors mandatory for all taxis. “We have extended the deadline. But cabbies will have to compulsorily have speed governors in their vehicles from July 1. As for checks on roads, we will give relief till October 31 for drivers who can’t make it for fitness tests in the coming weeks. From November 1, we will prosecute all taxis found without speed governors,’’ the source added.
