CHENNAI: It is a first anniversary any self-respecting statutory body would strive to forget. Come May 13, the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) will complete one year without a regular chairman. Despite being a national body having appellate jurisdiction over such happening topics as patent, trademark, geographical indication (GI) and design,   is today a one-member entity, crippled due to lack of coram.

 IPAB is supposed to be headed by a retired judge of a high court as chairman to be assisted by a vice-chairman, technical member (patent), technical member (trade mark) and technical member. While the chairman will be a permanent fixture, technical member of a particular expertise will sit with them as third member depending upon the type of dispute taken up.
 
 Since May 13, 2016, when the then chairman Justice K N Basha retired, IPAB has no chairman, and it is being helmed by Sanjeev Kumar Chaswal, who was the lone technical member (trademark) at that time, as acting chairman.
 
 With nearly 50,000 applications and appeals pending before it, IPAB is all but a dead body , said advocate P Sanjai Gandhi, president of   ( ).
 
 As a result of utter inaction, this year's US Trade Representative ( ), special report has put India in its `Priority Watch List' for poor record, along with 10 other non-compliant nationsrued Sanjai Gandhi, whose IPRAA has written two letters to the Centre, without much success. IPAB's growing importance and global relevance could be gauged from the Centre's latest decision bring all related activities under one umbrella Â­   (IPO).
 
 While all these are welcome, what is the point in having an IPAB, which is appellate forum above all these, without a chairman and technical members, asked Sanjai Gandhi.IPRAA plans to take up the issue of unfilled vacancies more seriously by meeting union ministers, he said.
