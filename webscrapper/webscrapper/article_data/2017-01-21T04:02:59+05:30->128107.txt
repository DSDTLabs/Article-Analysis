CHENNAI: A 'shariat council' that had been conducting unauthorised 'conciliation' programmes and settling matrimonial and other cases at   on   was rapped by the Madras high court, which said the council gave the impression that it was some kind of judicial forum. 

 The first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice M  , concurring with the submissions of senior counsel A Sirajudeen, referred to "the alleged orders and the board which has been placed at the spot where the proceedings are stated to be carried out, that too, inside the mosque. The board clearly showed that what is set out is as if the shariat council is a court. In fact, the word 'court' is used twice. Thus, the impression which is conveyed to the public at large is of a court functioning."
 
 The bench was passing further orders on a PIL of   who wanted a direction to the state government, the DGP and the Chennai city commissioner of police to take immediate measures to stop the functioning of the council and all other similar organisations working as a dispute adjudicating body in Tamil Nadu.
 
 The bench, which had already held in its last orders that no place of worship should be used for non-religious work, said on Friday: "We have also to take note of the fact that persons visiting the mosque may be from different social status and insofar as the less educated persons may be concerned, or women who are vulnerable, certainly the board would give an impression as if in the nature of a judicial forum is working."
 
 Taking exception to the court-like procedure adopted by the council, the judges said: "If we see the notice issued, it refers to the registration of a case and calls upon views to be given in response. The decision is cited as a shariat decision, refers to a case number, the parties as plaintiff and defendant and in the end states that it is a shariat decision and is signed by three persons. In this format it unequivocally seeks to convey that it has some judicial sanctity."
