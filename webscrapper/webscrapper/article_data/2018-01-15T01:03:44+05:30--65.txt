NEW DELHI: Delhi BJP’s Poorvanchal wing organised a cultural event to celebrate   on Sunday. The event was attended by thousands of supporters from the community and party members. 

 It is being seen as an attempt by state unit   Manoj Tiwari to consolidate the Poorvanchal vote bank and silence his detractors. Several party members from the Poorvanchal community attended the function, including Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Giriraj Singh. West Delhi MP Parvesh Verma,   national secretaries Arun Singh and Anil Jain, spokespersons Syed Shahnawaz Hussain and Sambit Patra, Delhi BJP in charge Shyam Jaju and organisational secretary Sidharthan were also present.
 
 With Lok Sabha elections scheduled in 2019, the party wants to cash in on the vote bank, which played a crucial role in AAP’s win in the 2015 assembly elections. BJP members said the party is making serious attempts to strengthen its base in slums and unauthorised colonies, which have a high percentage of Poorvanchali population. Addressing the gathering, Ravi Shankar Prasad said   are present in every corner of the world and have contributed towards development. 
 
 BJP’s decision to elevate Tiwari as the Delhi unit chief, many in the party say, proved to be a game-changer in the municipal elections last year. 
 
 The decision to appoint a Poorvanchali as its state chief and give more tickets to people from the community helped the party win all the three corporations, despite strong anti-incumbency. 
 
 Ever since his elevation, there is discontent within the party. Sunday’s event, party members say, was an attempt to silence his detractors. “The people of Poorvanchal have achieved their place with the help of their hard labour,” said Tiwari.
