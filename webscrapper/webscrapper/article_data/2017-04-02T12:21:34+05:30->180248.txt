MUMBAI:  , the former broadcast rights holder of Indian cricket, before   took over in 2012, has lost a five-year long arbitration with the Indian cricket board and will now pay the latter a sum of Rs 328.405 crores.

 The arbitral tribunal comprising Justice BP Jeevan Reddy, Justice AS Anand and co-arbitrator Justice SP Kurudkar awarded the arbitration in favour of the   and have directed   to pay the amount "towards unpaid right fees for matches in respect for which Nimbus had already exploited the media rights under the MRLA".
 
 Nimbus also has been directed to pay an additional Rs 25 lakh as costs within two months from the date of the award - which was given out last week, alongside interest on the entire amounts at 9% interest per annum from 18 August, 2012 till realisation.
 
 "The Arbitral Tribunal has also dismissed all the counter-claims put forward by Nimbus," the adjudication read. BCCI was represented by its law firm  , who now work full time with the cricket board in coordination with CEO  .
 
 In 2012, Nimbus had filed three arbitration claims against BCCI after the latter terminated its contract for broadcast rights in 2011.
 
 The first claim, which went in favour of Nimbus, was that BCCI defaulted on its payment for supply of OB equipment and technical services. The BCCI's counter claims were dismissed.
 
 The second claim was that BCCI defaulted on payments for television production. For this, Nimbus has claimed Rs 14.5 crore (Rs 145 million) with accumulated interest and the arbitration was awarded in their favour in 2015.
 
 The third arbitration claim was for termination of Nimbus' media rights agreement with the BCCI.
 
 Nimbus won the first two claims but has lost out on the following ones. The loss of third claim should come as a huge setback to the former broadcaster as they were confident of winning it.
