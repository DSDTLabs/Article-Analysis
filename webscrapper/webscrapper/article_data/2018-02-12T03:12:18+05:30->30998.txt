NEW DELHI: A spell of light to moderate rain on Monday afternoon is likely to halt Delhi’s rising mercury levels, met officials predict. The city’s maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 25.5° Celsius — three notches above normal. Monday’s forecast shows the maximum temperature may fall to as low as 20° Celsius.

 “Light rain on Monday afternoon will bring down the mercury level to below normal once again. Maximum temperature may fall to as low as 18° over the next few days and it is likely to provide some relief to the region,” said a scientist at the Regional   Forecasting Centre.
 
 Sunday’s minimum temperature was recorded at 8.5 degrees Celsius, which is two degrees below normal for the season. Officials say the minimum temperature may hover around 11° on Monday. Maximum temperature remained equally high across the capital, with all weather stations recording a maximum above 25° Celsius.
 
 The capital last saw rain on January 23, after which the mercury took a plunge. Delhi’s air quality, however, was recorded in the “very poor” category on Sunday with an Air Quality Index of 310. The average PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels hovered around three times the safe standard. Experts say that Delhi’s air quality is likely to improve once again due to the rain with readings expected to fall below 300 on Monday.
