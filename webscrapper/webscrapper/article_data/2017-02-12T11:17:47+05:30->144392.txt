NASHIK: After Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the   ( ) and   are ready to release their manifestos for the upcoming civic elections on Sunday and Monday respectively.

 Yuva Sena chief Aditya Thackeray will release the party   — touted to be a people’s manifesto — for the Nashik Municipal Corporation (NMC) elections on February 13.
 
 City president Ajay Boraste said, “Our manifesto is ready. Aditya will be coming to Nashik on February 13 and we plan to publish the party manifesto for the polls on that day.”
 
 He added, “We sought opinions of different people in the city while preparing the manifesto, like architects, engineers, entrepreneurs, artists, women and others. The manifesto will reflect what the citizens want. It is a manifesto of the Nashikites.”
 
 Meanwhile, the MNS is planning to release its manifesto on Sunday. “Our manifesto is ready. We are planning to publish it by Sunday evening,” said senior MNS leader and spokesperson Avinash Abhyankar.
 
 All eyes are set on the MNS manifesto. The party that has been in power for the last five years has been bragging about beautification and road works. Though citizens have welcomed these works, they expect more from the party that promised to bring about a revolution in the city.
 
 “This election, the promises of saffron parties (BJP and Sena) and MNS would be interesting. The MNS has done little as compared to the tall promises they made during the last polls while the SS-BJP alliance before that hardly did much. This time with all parties planning to go solo, their assurances are worth a watch. Barring some beautification works the only infrastructure work that MNS has done are road works across the city,” said Rakesh Shastri, an entrepreneur.
