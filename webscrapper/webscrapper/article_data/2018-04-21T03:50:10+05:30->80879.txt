MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday discharged a contempt notice issued to civic chief Ajoy   for not taking action against illegal pandals put up during festivals last year. However, a bench of Justices   and   cautioned: “We make it clear that hereafter during any of the religious festivals, any breach is noticed, the same will be viewed seriously and may amount to a case of aggravated contempt.”

 Mehta had been issued a show-cause notice on November 2, 2017. The judges had noted that out of 268 pandals put up in the city, BMC found 78 illegal. A chart showed that 42 of these had been spared.
 
 The judges said an affidavit filed by the BMC shows relevant directions had not been complied, but from an affidavit filed by Mehta, “it appears to us that there is no intentional breach on his part”.
