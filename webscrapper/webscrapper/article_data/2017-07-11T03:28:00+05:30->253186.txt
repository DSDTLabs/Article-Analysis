Panaji: Deputy speaker and Calangute MLA Michael Lobo said Goa police have failed to identify the culprits involved in the incidents of desecration of crosses. If they can’t arrest those involved, the investigation should be handed over to the CBI, he said at a press conference on Monday. Lobo said he suspects an “outside hand” in the repeated incidents of desecration of crosses over the last few days and this has to be stopped. “Investigation has to be handed over to the CBI if Goa police are unable to nab the culprits. Goa police are not working,” said Lobo. The Calangute MLA, who has always been vociferous, said he will take up this matter with chief minister Manohar Parrikar once he returns from his trip to the US. Parrikar is scheduled to return from his week-long tour on Wednesday evening. Saying the people were let down by the police, Lobo said “Somewhere, something is wrong” and suggested that police reintroduce the methods it had adopted a few years ago when similar incidents of vandalism were reported in Goa. Although he denied there was a law and order problem in the state, Lobo said,“Somebody is trying to create such a problem.”
