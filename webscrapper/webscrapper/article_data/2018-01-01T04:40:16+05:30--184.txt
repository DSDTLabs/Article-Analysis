NEW DELHI: The   has asked chief ministers not to make surprise visits to other states without informing the host government, as they might pose security risk. 

  In a communication to chief secretaries/UT administrators, the ministry conveyed that it has come to know that sometimes chief minister of a state travels to another state without informing the host government. "This not only compromises the security of the visiting chief ministers, it can lead to potential embarrassing situations where the security detail accompanying the visiting chief minister is told that it has no jurisdiction outside the home state," it said. 
 
 The ministry told the chief secretaries to convey to the respective chief ministers the need to inform the host state when he or she visits another state in interest of security.
 
  All CMs are 'Z' or 'Z-plus' protectees and as per procedure, when a chief minister travels to another state, it is the duty of the host state to provide adequate security. Under Z or Z-plus category, a dignitary usually gets 40-50 police officers/commandos in personal security detail wherever he/she travels.
