Visakhapatnam: Andhra University vice-chancellor Prof G Nageswara Rao on Saturday met the teaching and non-teaching staff of the university who staged a protest against the statement made by MLC MVVS Murthy. He said, “If he has made demeaning statements regarding his alma mater, he must apologise immediately.” 

 At the launch of the Mahanadu poster at his house on Wednesday, the former MP had alleged that Andhra University has become ‘a devil’s den’ and hosting the Mahanadu will improve the campus environment.
 
 The AU Executive Council condemned his remarks and issued a public statement stating, “It is unfortunate that a senior educationalist like MVVS Murthy should have said these words. He himself is an alumnus of this university and he should not disrespect it. The university's name is not dependent on politicians or political parties but on the academic work by its faculty and academic community.”
 
 Prof Rao was quite guarded in his remarks and observed, “Andhra University is a 90-year-old university with a great history and tradition. Nobody can belittle the university which is still considered one of the best in the country.” 
 
 However, the non-teaching staff decided to continue their protest till the MLC withdraws his comments and apologises for having made such statements.
