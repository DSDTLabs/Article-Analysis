 Tiwary said, “We have water facilities but to wash the railway tracks, we need a jet of water that comes only from water booth which we do not have right now.”
 
 Tiwary said the outsourcer will collect garbage from only two major Delhi bound trains namely Up and Dn   and Up and Dn Rajdhani Express trains.
 
 He conceded that passengers of these two long distance trains throw their leftovers right on the railway tracks when the trains are stationed for two minutes here which present a very bleak look of the tracks.
 
 The MoU is for 3 years but it can be reviewed with the imposition of penalty in case services are satisfactory, Tiwary said .
