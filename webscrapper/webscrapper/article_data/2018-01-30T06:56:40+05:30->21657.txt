AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday refused to grant any relief to famous Bollywood filmmaker   and he withdrew his petitions demanding   in   in Rajkot.

 Santoshi withdrew his petitions after the high court indicated it was not inclined to entertain them. Santoshi has made famous movies like Ghayal, Damini and Andaz Apna Apna.
 
 The case pertains to two cheques worth Rs 17 lakh and Rs 5 lakh issued by Santoshi to real estate baron Anil Jethani of Rajkot, who had produced a film ‘Ankur Arora Murder Case’. Santoshi had reportedly brought a proposal for a film to Jethani, but the project did not materialize. After the cheques were not honoured, Jethani sued Santoshi in a court in Rajkot. He filed two complaints, and Santoshi was summoned by the court repeatedly.
 
 Finally, Santoshi appeared before the court last year. He was warned by the court not to ignore court proceedings in future before being granted bail on a surety of Rs 25,000.
