AHMEDABAD: The state’s in-charge DGP   has been given a three-month extension in service. A notification issued by the central government on Tuesday said that Pandey, who was to retire on January 31, had been given extension up to April 30. 

 Pandey, a 1980-batch IPS officer, was made in-charge DGP after the state’s last full-time DGP and IGP, PC Thakur, was transferred to Delhi in April last year. Pandey is currently posted as director of state anti-corruption bureau (ACB).
 
 Sources said that SS Khandwawala was the last DGP to get a three-month extension in 2010.
 
 According to the notification dates January 31, 2017, the Union ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions, and the appointments committee of the cabinet has approved the proposal of the Gujarat government for an extension in service to PP Pandey as in-charge DGP and director, state ACB. 
 
 He has been given extension for three months beyond January 31 under rule 16(1) of All India Services Rules, 1958.
 
 Sources close to the DGP office said the extension to Pandey move has triggered a race among top IPS officers for the post of the next DGP. 
 
 Who the next DGP is crucial as assembly polls in Gujarat will be held in 2017. Currently, the state has four DGP-rank officers. 
 
 Apart from Pandey, HP Singh (1980 batch), Geetha Johari (1982 batch) and Pramod Kumar (1983 batch) are the senior-most IPS officers in the state.
 
 “Singh, DGP of civil defence and home guards, does not stand a chance now as he is retiring in March this year,” said a source. 
 
 “The tenure of Johari, managing director of   (GPHC), will come to an end in November. Pramod Kumar, DGP, state armed police, will retire in February next year. Both Johari and Kumar have met chief minister and deputy chief minister recently,” the source said.
 
 The grapevine is that  , a 1983-batch IPS officer currently posted as ADGP, CID (IB), is also in the race.
