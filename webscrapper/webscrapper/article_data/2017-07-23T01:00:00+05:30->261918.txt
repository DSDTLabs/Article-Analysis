BHAGALPUR: Bhagalpur IG Sushil M Khopde has directed the SPs of districts under the zone to undertake a drive against white-collared  .

 A high-level meeting with senior police officials of neighbouring districts in Jharkhand and West Bengal is also likely to be held soon to discuss steps to stop inter-state liquor smuggling.
 
 The drive against liquor smugglers and consumers will be launched in Bhagalpur, Banka, Naugachhia, Munger, Jamui, Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai, Begusarai and Khagaria districts under the Bhagalpur police zone. Sources said the IG felt the need to launch such a drive in view of frequent arrests of bootleggers and consumers in different districts.
 
 In this connection, the IG held meetings with the SPs of the zoneâ€™s nine districts and the Bhagalpur and Munger DIGs. The IG directed the SPs to prepare a dossier of liquor smugglers and suspects so that action, if need be, could could be taken against them without delay. He also directed the SPs to take legal steps for confiscating the properties of liquor mafia and bootleggers.
 
 According to the sources, police have received information about the involvement of inter-state gangs in liquor smuggling. Licensed liquor shop owners and distributors in neighbouring states allegedly make supply to the smugglers at a premium, the sources said.
 
 Talking to TOI on Saturday, the IG said directives had been issued to the SPs to send action taken reports against the police personnel found lax in enforcing the prohibition laws. Reports have also been sought on the number of arrests of bootleggers and their properties confiscated so far since the prohibition was enforced in the state in April last year.
