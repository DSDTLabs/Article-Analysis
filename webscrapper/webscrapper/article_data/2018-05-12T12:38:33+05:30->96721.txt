BHUBANESWAR: The   ( ) on Thursday decided to do away with physical transaction of holding tax collection and activate its online system from June in a bid to reduce manual work and help taxpayers clear their dues on time. 

 
 Holding tax is collected from individual households, business establishments, commercial centres, shops, malls, private and government offices on the basis of plinth area covered. It is a major component of revenue for the civic body. It collected Rs 42 crore in holding tax in the 2017-18 financial year.
 
 To ensure 100% online collection of   of the taxpayers, the BMC issued an order scrapping the manual system. "Firstly, it will help us collect last-minute dues from people as they can do so by opening the online gateway. Secondly, we won't have to use pen and paper to maintain tax records and track defaulters. The partner bank sends us the transaction statement about the online payment made. We manually record them in the register, at present. But after mandatory online application, we will furnish the payment details, in e-municipality module, which has the facility to store data in soft form," said BMC deputy commissioner  .
 
 Though the civic body had set a target of collecting Rs 45 crore as holding tax in the 2017-18 financial year, it received only Rs 42 crore. It had put up hoarding bearing the names of the tax defaulters, but that didn't help collect the pending dues. "A week before the end of the financial year, we had put up the names of 253 defaulters. Of that, only one individual turned up to pay the dues. Once the holding tax payment is made compulsorily online, the defaulters intending to pay the dues in the last moment can do so," said an official of BMC.
 
 The civic body started receiving holding tax online since 2015. But it hasn't been a success as most of the work related to the   is still handled manually.
