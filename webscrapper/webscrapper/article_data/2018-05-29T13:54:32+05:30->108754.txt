SURAT: The Surat Citizen Council Trust ( ) has appealed to the   (SMC) to refrain from spending lakhs of rupees on ‘jal pujan’ event to be held on May 31 to mark the conclusion of ‘Sujalam Sufalam Jal Abhiyan’ and invoke the blessings of rain god. 

 
 
 In a letter to municipal commissioner and mayor, SCCT president Sharad   stated that the ‘jal pujan’ event would incur expenditure of several lakhs and that there is no guarantee that this will bring rains in sufficient quantity. 
 
 Kapadia further stated that SCCT does not oppose or criticize well-intentioned religious ceremonies, but would definitely like to point out that the results of this activity are not assured. This amount instead should be spent on rainwater harvesting and recharging of borewells as that would be more beneficial, he said. 
 
 Kapadia told TOI, “The meteorology department has also forecast that there will be timely and normal rainfall this year. As such the rain forecast is scientific. Therefore, we earnestly appeal to SMC to refrain from this activity and save the money for water management. The Diamond City is on the verge of facing an acute water shortage in the coming years and the problem of water hyacinth in river   is also of grave concern. SMC must utilize its resources in right direction.”
