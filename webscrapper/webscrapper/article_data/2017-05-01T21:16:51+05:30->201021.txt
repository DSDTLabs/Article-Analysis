BENGALURU: A 25-year-old man has allegedly murdered his wife for hiding her first marriage from him and dumped the body in a wooded area near  ,  . A few days after the incident, Bengaluru police arrested Ajay Das from his village in Assam on Saturday.

 Ajay had met Junali Goola, 23, a garment worker at a garment factory in Electronic City. He had come to Bengaluru from Assam three years ago, while Junali two years ago. Ajay courted Junali for a long time and the couple married six months ago, but knew little about each other’s background. Last week, Junali tested positive for pregnancy and was taken to a gynaecologist.
 
 During the examination, the doctor asked Junali if she had been pregnant earlier and to Ajay’s shock, she said she had two children. “Though she told him that she was forced to marry at a young age and she ran away from the bad marriage to the city, he was not convinced,” said police.
 
 After reaching home that night, Ajay attacked her with a blunt object and strangled her to death with a shawl. He later dumped the woman’s body wrapped in a bedsheet. Three days later, ragpickers found the body. It was decomposed and except for a ring, where were no identification. Based on the lead that she could be from northeast, police searched houses in the nearby area.
 
 “A man informed us that a couple lived in a house nearby, but now there’s no information about them. When we inspected the house, we found blood stains,” said the officer.
 
 Police found out that it’s Ajay Das’s house and the body was that of his wife. They zeroed in the accused after collecting his address in Assam from his workplace.
