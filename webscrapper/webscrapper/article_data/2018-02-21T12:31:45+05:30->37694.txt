PORVORIM: The treasury as well as opposition members of the House have expressed concern over the   order in which the renewal of 88   leases have been quashed. They demanded that the government come up with a solution.

 Taking part in the governor’s speech address, deputy speaker   said around two lakh people have been affected by the latest verdict on mining. “We need to find a solution to the mining issue immediately,” Lobo said, adding that chief minister   should recover quickly and come back to the state to hold a high-power meeting on mining to solve the issue.
 
 “Mining has to resume through whichever way possible, including auctioning of leases,” Lobo said. He also said all MLAs should unite to come up with a solution to the mining issue.
 
 Former chief minister and   Pratapsingh Rane said the governor avoided mentioning anything about mining in her address. He said he would be calling attention on Wednesday to raise the issue. “There are around 4,000 trucks and a lot of truck owners. Sometimes, five families survive on the earnings of a single truck. Not only do banks earn interest in the mining economy, but also others who run small businesses,” Rane said. He also expressed fear of a spurt in theft cases in the mining belt as a fallout of the ban.
 
 Rane further said the government should translate all laws passed by the Portuguese government. “Some of these laws are in force,” he stated. The Poriem MLA also said theft cases in   have increased and that the government should come up with an education policy and finalise the Regional Plan 2021.
 
 Curtorim MLA Aleixo Lourenco said mining was dependent on natural resources and the Presidential address to the   clearly stated that all natural resources should be auctioned. “Mining resources cannot be replenished. “We have told the government not to renew leases and settle the issue,” Lourenco said. “We are not here to oppose anybody. All stakeholders should follow the rule of law.”
