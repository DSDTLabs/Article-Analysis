NEW DELHI: The work at the much-delayed   project has resumed. Though it will miss the May deadline, officials claim that the project is now likely to get completed by  . 

 The bridge aims to reduce the travel time between north and northeast Delhi by improving   between Ring Road and northeast Delhi. The contractors had stopped work due to non-payment of funds. 
 
  
  
 Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) officials said 95% of the work was over. “Initially, only two-wheelers will be allowed, and after two months, four-wheelers will get access,” said an official.
 
 The bridge, which will be suspended on cables, can handle both light and heavy four-wheelers only after these cables are 100% stressed, he said. The trial run will begin in June.
 
 The existing Wazirabad Bridge, the main access between northeast and north Delhi, is in a bad shape. PWD is now repairing the bridge, which will be completed in three phases. “Each phase will be finished in three months as we cannot shut the entire bridge at one go,” said a senior official. 
 
 In a meeting held by deputy CM   in March, the authorities were directed to speed up the Signature Bridge work and complete the project in a time-bound manner. Sisodia had said more funds would be released to complete the project. 
  
 The project was conceptualised in 2004 and got the nod from the Delhi cabinet in 2007. The first deadline was fixed ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games but it was revised to 2013. The initial cost of the project was Rs 887 crore, which has now esclated to Rs 1,574 crore. The bridge will be the first asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge in the country, which will be 675-metre long and 35.2-metre wide. The pylon, which will be 154m high, has already been constructed.
