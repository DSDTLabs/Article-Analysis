VIJAYAWADA: Pouring cold water on aspirations of political parties fighting for the special category status to Andhra Pradesh, the Union government made it clear in   on Tuesday that   will not be granted to any state.

 Union minister of state Pon Radhakrishnan, in a reply to YSRC MP  , said that the SCS will not come under the purview of the 15th finance commission. It may be noted that earlier, the Centre had also said   could not be granted SCS because it was the recommendation of the 14th finance commission. Asked whether the 15th finance commission is planning to roll back all the central schemes, the minister said that there is no such proposal.
