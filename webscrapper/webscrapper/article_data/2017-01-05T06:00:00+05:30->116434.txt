Visakhapatnam: Senior accountant in the district treasury department G Srinivas was caught red-handed by Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) officials while demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 6,000 from a junior lecturer here on Wednesday. 

 Addressing the media, ACB DSP K Ramakrishna Prasad said the junior lecturer of Government Junior College in Pendurthi was recently regularised. However, his salary was pending for the past six months. The bills were cleared by the tribunal and passed on to the treasury department for clearance.
 
 When the complainant approached Srinivas, who is a Group-II officer, for release of his salary amount, the accused demanded a bribe of Rs 8,000 for doing the work. However, he later agreed to accept Rs 6,000. 
 
 Fed up with the harassment, the junior lecturer approached the ACB officials who laid a trap and arrested Srinivas when he was accepting the bribe.
