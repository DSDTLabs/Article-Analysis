PANAJI: With the water resources department ( ) designating its officials to oversee the process of granting assistance under ‘Nital Goem Nital Baim’, there is hope for cleaning these sources but other related schemes should be linked to it.

 The public works department (PWD) sponsors and supports a scheme   offering kits to test the quality of well water. Another scheme coordinated through the primary health centre at the local level and village health, nutrition and sanitation of each panchayat body contributes to controlling vector-borne diseases by introducing guppy fish.
 
 “If Nital Goem, Nital Baim schemes is tied up with these two schemes, it could be a boon to well owners as well as help in cleaning underground water sources,” said   of GOACAN.
 
 Under the scheme, each beneficiary will receive financial assistance up to Rs 50,000 to repair the existing private wells for public use. The government notified on Thursday the executive and assistant engineers of WRD to oversee the process in all 12 talukas.
 
 Some years ago, a statewide programme for use of the kits, bought at a cost of Rs 11 lakh, to check water sources in rural areas through community effort came a cropper, as the panchayats did not show much interest in using the free kits. 
 
 “The appointed officials will process the applications, which can also be filed online,” WRD minister   told TOI on Friday.
