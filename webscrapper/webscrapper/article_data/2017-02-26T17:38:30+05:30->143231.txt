The Thattathin Marayathu girl   is making steady inroads into Bollywood with two superstar projects in her kitty,  's Chef and  's Tubelight. While Isha had a great time working with the Khans, she feels blessed to have worked with the legendary actor   in his last film.

 Isha, who shot with Om Puri in Kulu and Manali, says, 'We worked for about three months together, on and off. He would take us out to the Manali market; ask us to try various fruits that are from the region. He was a big foodie.' The late veteran actor also told her about how a man like him, who couldn't speak a line of English, worked in Hollywood and the French film industry and the like, to become one of the few actors of his time to explore the territory of world cinema. 'I listened to it all wide-eyed like a kid,' Isha says.
 
 The actress adds that she is thankful that she got to act with him in a scene in his last movie! 'The day of the shoot remains etched in my memory. He even got me a beautiful pashmina scarf and gifted it like he would, to a daughter,' Isha says. His absence made a huge difference on the set, as he always used to be lively, she recalls.
 
 Speaking about working with Salman Khan, she says, 'He mostly keeps to himself on the sets but would crack a joke or two at times. He is chilled out and fun.' The actress has a retro look in Tubelight and plays a simple girl from a small town, who lived during the Sino-Indian war of 1962. 'I haven't been threading my eye-brows or even wearing clothes that have any new age print or texture, or colour for the movie, so that it looks authentic to the core. Also, no coloured hair or long nails,' says Isha.
