Ludhiana: After receiving a complaint from area residents, civic officials sealed two illegal parking sites (inside vacant plots behind the district court complex) late on Thursday night. Residents had complained that due to these sites, they were facing problems, as the road had become congested. Moreover, traffic inside the lane had increased, as people were coming there to park their vehicles inside the parking sites.

 Members of Model Gram Welfare Society complained that though there was facility of parking in the multi-level parking lot inside the Mini Secretariat, people still came to park their vehicles in these illegal sites. Residents rued that it was for the past several years that illegal parking sites were operational in the area, but now for some time, the vehicles were being parked on the road instead of the vacant plot.
 
 Assistant town planner (headquarters) SS Bindra said they had received a complaint regarding these illegal parking sites through residents, and operators did not take any permission from MC for making parking provisions inside vacant plots. Moreover, the parking sites were developed inside a residential area, so they sealed the premises, he added.
 
 Notably, in many residential areas, people are minting money by allowing other residents to park their vehicles inside vacant plots, and in return, they collect charges from them. In this case also, the parking sites were operational for many years, but officials acted only when residents complained about it.
