RAMPUR: Bhawna Rastogi, wife of the serial offender arrested by police from east Delhi's Ashok Nagar for sexually abusing many minor girls, has said that she and her children seek capital punishment for the paedophile whose notoriety has made their lives "hell". 

 Bhawna, who has five children from the 17-year-old marriage and is suffering from bone tumour which has caused deformity in her spinal cord, told TOI on Tuesday that her husband was always "looking for sex" and used to frequent Delhi-NCR to target innocent kids. 
 
 "I was badly tortured by Sunil (Rastogi) when I opposed his filthy deeds. Desperate for sex, he often ran away from the house without informing anybody to look for vulnerable targets. Six months ago when he was released from Haldwani jail, I had advised him to stop his activities as his own daughters could be targeted by a pervert someday. But he ignored me and continued with his depraved acts," Bhawna said.
 
 The couple, who got married in Ghaziabad's   locality where Sunil used to work as a tailor, has been shifting houses frequently due to his criminal activities. His kids, 16-year-old brother-sister twins, two boys aged 13 and 8 and another nine-year-old girl, have never attended school and the older ones do odd jobs to support their mother.
 
 In 2016 when Sunil was jailed for sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl in Rudrapur, the family shifted to   tehsil in Rampur and began to live with Bhawna's brother Naresh Saini, who works as a plumber. "Seventeen years ago, when they had an arranged marriage, Sunil was known as a good tailor in the vicinity," Saini said. 
 
 Sunil was released from Haldwani jail in May 2016 and came back to Bilaspur. However, when his notoriety began to affect even Saini's family, Bhawna had to shift again.
