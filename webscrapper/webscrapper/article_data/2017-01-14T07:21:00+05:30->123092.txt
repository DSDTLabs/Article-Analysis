BHATINDA: Congress candidate from Budhlada assembly constituency in Mansa, Ranjit Kaur Bhatti’s accomplice-cum-driver Parvesh Kumar ran away from police custody late on Friday afternoon, along with handcuffs, from an election meeting at Malko village. Proceedings for declaring Parvesh a proclaimed offender were going on in the court of   (JMFC) Manmohan Kaur in Ludhiana. A head constable Jagjit Singh, from Ludhiana, along with other policemen and some persons in plain clothes had come to arrest Parvesh.

 He had put handcuffs and was about to make him sit in the vehicle when Parvesh, taking help from supporters, ran away, said sources. Bhatti was present in the election meeting when the incident happened at Malko. In the melee, Bhatti and her associate Harpreet Kaur fell down and sustained injuries. Bhatti was taken to Budhlada Hospital. Punjab Congress secretary   said: “Some policemen in plain clothes came to Malko and tried to arrest Parvesh. They had an altercation with the Congress workers. In the melee, our candidate Bhatti and her accomplice fell down and sustained injuries.” 
 
  (SDP)   said: “As per the complaint filed by head constable Jagjit, Ludhiana resident Inder Singh had filed a petition against Parvesh about dishonour of a cheque. A court had issued summons on January 11 to arrest Parvesh. The head constable had reached Malko and arrested Parvesh. He had put handcuffs when some persons from the election meeting came near him, and taking advantage of the situation, Parvesh ran away with handcuffs. Parvesh is still at large and efforts are being made to arrest him.”
