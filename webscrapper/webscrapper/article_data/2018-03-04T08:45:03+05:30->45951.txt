 Vidvat added he was hit with beer bottles even after he apologised. “The impact of the attack rendered him unconscious,” police said.
 
 “I repeatedly apologised and requested the attackers to stop. The more I said sorry, the more punches I received. They even hit me with ice buckets and other objects picked up from tables,” Vidvat told the cops. The cafe’s staff and other customers then came to his rescue.

 A CCB team headed by an ACP recorded Vidvat’s statement in the presence of doctors. On two earlier occassions, police returned as doctors said he was in no condition to speak with them.
