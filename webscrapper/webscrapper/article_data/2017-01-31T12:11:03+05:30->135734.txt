NEW DELHI: There are several anecdotes from  's storied career to keep one entertained but this one in particular will leave you in awe of the master's humility and open-mindedness. 

 Tendulkar has revealed that suggestion from a Chennai waiter helped him improve his batting.
 
 "If you have an open mind you can develop so many things," Tendulkar said during an event in Mumbai on Monday. "In Chennai it was a waiter who came up to me and said if you don't mind and don't get offended I want to tell you something. I said go ahead. He said my elbow guard restricts my bat swing. And he was 100 percent right." 
 
 Considered to be the best batsman to have graced the game, Tendulkar scored 34357 runs across formats with 100 international centuries.
 
 Tendulkar was aware of the discomfort his elbow guard was causing but ignored it. Later, when he got hit on his elbow while batting, it prompted him to redesign the guard.
 
 "I knew I was feeling uncomfortable but I never thought of doing it myself. A few years down the line I got hit a couple of times on my elbow guard and it hurt. That's when I realised padding on elbow guard is inadequate," he said.
 
 "I instantly redesigned my elbow guard. I needed to re-open it and work on it. Get the fibre and cushion on either side to absorb the impact. In our country everyone from panwala to CEOs will give you advice. But one should still be open about ideas," added Tendulkar.
 
 Something we all can learn about being receptive to ideas no matter where they are coming from. Isn't it?
