AHMEDABAD: After the CBSE-affiliated schools, a school affiliated with the   (ICSE) Board approached   high court on Friday, challenging the validity of the recently introduced Gujarat   (Regulation of Fees) Act.

 While the high court refused to stay implementation of the new law, it issued notice to the state go FEE & vernment and sought reply by FAIR June 12. Like it did for   affiliated schools, the HC extended the deadline from May 25 to June 15 for ICSE-affiliated schools also for supplying details including accounts of the school to the fee regulation committee concerned.
 
 The private self-financed schools have taken strong objection to the diktat that those schools that are charging fees more than fixed caps Â­ Rs 15,000 for primary schools, Rs 25,000 for secondary and higher secondary schools in general stream and Rs 27,000 for higher secondary in science stream, should submit proposal for approval of fee structure from the committee. On Thursday, the schools affiliated with CBSE raised a contention that the government does not allocate enough funds for education sector and it has failed to provide quality education in its own schools, which lack even basic infrastructure. In such circumstances, the government must not take measures by enacting laws that could discourage investment and funding in education sector.
