Hyderabad: Bengaluru-headquartered beauty salon chain R & R Salons Pvt Ltd, which runs salons under the   (You Look Great) brand, announced its foray into the Hyderabad market on Thursday and unveiled plans to invest Rs 65 crore in setting up 100 new salons over the next three years.

 The company, in which Everstone Capital Partners Llc holds majority stake and is backed by Helion Venture Partners, also plans to take its `Made in India’ consumer retail, body hair management products range — Slogro — international, YLG founder, director and CEO Rahul Bhalchandra told TOI.
 
 “We plan to take Slogro international over the next 24-36 months starting with Middle East, going on to Africa and Asian market. We are also applying for a global patent,” he said, adding that though it will manage the salon chain expansion through internal accruals, it will look at PE funding over the next 24 months to expand its product range.
 
 The company, which currently operates 57 salons across Bengaluru (44), Chennai (10) and Hyderabad (3), also plans to add eight salons in these cities by March 2018, including three in Hyderabad. 
 
 Talking about the Hyderabad foray, Bhalchandra said: “After our successful stints in Bengaluru and Chennai, Hyderabad was our obvious choice for expansion as it is among the best cities in terms of quality of living where women are spending significantly on beauty and wellness products and services. We are committed to building a strong network of outlets in Hyderabad and strengthen our position as leaders in South India.” 
 
 Founded in 2008 by IIT graduates Rahul Bhalchandra and Vaijayanti Bhalchandra, R & R Salons clocked Rs 50 crore revenues in FY17 and is eyeing Rs 70 crore in FY18. It also operates in the home salon segment and offers the YLG range of professional beauty care products, which are developed and manufactured by a Spanish player for YLG.
