Rajkot: A 72-year-old woman living alone was brutally killed in her house in Master Society at   in Rajkot. 

 The victim Jaishree Shukla, a retired schoolteacher, is suspected to have been murdered in the five days but the crime came to light only on Thursday. “Her neighbours did not see Shukla out of her house for the past five days. They also found stench emanating from the house following which they informed the police. The door was opened and police found her decomposed body,” VK Gadhvi, Bhaktinagar police station inspector said. 
 
 The assailants had slit her throat, said Gadhvi. 
 
 Police have ruled out loot as the motive behind the murder as valuables and jewellery in the house were intact. Shukla was a divorcee and had no children. Her marriage lasted only for six months after which she had been living alone for many years. 
 
 Postmortem report confirmed her death caused by slashing of her throat with a knife. 
 
 “We have registered a case based on the the complaint lodged by Shukla’s brother Vishnu Shukla who lives in   on  . We are probing several angles. It may be the case of a fight over property or an internal dispute between the family members,” Gadhvi added. 
 
 Police have booked the unidentified assailants whose numbers are yet to be ascertained. Police are checking the footages of   cameras installed at the locations close to her house to get more clues.
