NEW DELHI: In the aftermath of the   and murder case, Vice President   warned that communal forces were working to fracture social harmony for their own political agenda.

 
 "Unfortunately, various forces in the country are trying to divide the nation for their narrow political gains," Naidu said at the launch of the book 'Dr Babasaheb  : Vyakti Nahin Sankalp' at the Rashtrapati Bhawan on Saturday.
 
 Naidu, who has deep roots in the  's ideological fountainhead, the  , went on to say that a nationalist is someone who respects all individuals living in the country.
 
 "Nation means all living creatures of this land, unless one respect each human being, one cannot be called a nationalist," the BJP leader said, as reported by ANI.
 
 Naidu's remarks came against the backdrop of heightened communal tensions in Jammu and Kashmir following the horrific gangrape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim Bakerwal girl in Kathua district. The minor was repeatedly raped while being held captive at a temple for several days. Police said the premeditated attack was as a way to terrify the Bakarwals into leaving the area.
 
 Soon after the suspects were arrested, members of right-wing Hindu groups marched through the streets of Jammu, demanding that police release the men. Two BJP ministers seen attending one such rally were pressured into stepping down owing to public anger at their apparent support for the eight accused.
 
 Also in attendance at the book launch was President  , who targeted politics of vested interests and said the country needs to be rid of casteism as it hinders economic development and disintegrates peace and harmony in society.
 
 "People must work with the mindset of 'don't break but integrate the relations'," Kovind said as quoted by PTI.
