There’s an interesting story behind 'Jolly Good Fellow', the latest promotional track from Subhash Kapoor’s 'Jolly LLB 2'. The idea for the song, which will be released today, came from lead actor Akshay Kumar’s four-year-old daughter,  , as BT had reported earlier. 
 The song begins where the film’s story draws to a close, with hundreds of junior artistes posing as Jolly’s (Akshay) well-wishers. “It shows the entire city celebrating his victory in the court. It also dwells on the person that Jolly is,” a source says. 
 
 The track was shot at a studio in the city in a day, and BT was present on location. While the first half of the shoot focussed on creating a carnival-like atmosphere celebrating Jolly’s victory, the second half revolved around filming dance moves with junior artistes posing as pandits, lawyers and even Lord Krishna. 
 
 Huma Qureshi, Akshay’s leading lady in the film, also features in the number, which has been choreographed by  . The actor danced with abandon, though his back had suffered an injury while shooting for another film.
