LUCKNOW: Indians should steer clear of mercenaries and infiltrators and stay unified against extremism, while madrassa students should not pay heed to external calls of jihad from wahabis, said Syrian Arab Republic's general mufti Ahmad Badr Eddine Hassoun. Hassoun is on a two-day visit to the city. Talking to TOI on Monday, he said there should be a meeting of all religious heads to safeguard India.

 “Syrian crisis is not sectarian or religious. It is political interference of the western world, especially US, UK, Israel and Saudi Arabia, who want to destroy Arab countries. The situation is widely misrepresented by these forces who don't want the world to know the truth and this is why we have come here to share the truth with not just our Muslim brethren but all Indians," said Hassoun.
 
 The mufti was accompanied by Syrian ambassador to India Riyadh Abbas and his political adviser  . He compared India and Syria and cautioned madrassa students here against extremism and terrorism.
 
 “A 100 years ago, Syria was like undivided India. We had Palestine,  ,   and present Syria. All of us shared the same language and culture but the British and French divided us into four countries. Just as India was divided, these forces want partition in Middle East and Syria is paying the price," he said.
 
 Their visit was organised by the ministry of external affairs. They will also visit Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir.
