NEW DELHI: A   opened fire from his service pistol on the premises of   while trying to disperse a mob that was   during an   on Monday night. 

 The police said six people had been detained and an inquiry had been ordered to find out the cause of firing.
 
 Around 8pm, two people got into an argument in the unpaid area of the Metro station over exiting a token gate. DMRC personnel resolved the issue and tried to stop one of them from creating a ruckus during which the accused, later found to be a teenager from a JJ colony in the area, punched an official in the face. Soon CISF security personnel intervened and found the teenager to be drunk. 
 
 CISF officials said as some security officers tried to take the teenager to the DMRC office to fine him for travelling inebriated, he refused to accompany them. While security officials tried to convince him, he spoke to his family members over the phone. Soon a group of 20-25 people, including some women, reached the station. 
 
 They started manhandling officials and one of them even dragged the CISF duty in-charge, Mohammad Umar, by his collar and tried to thrash him. When officials tried to inform the police control room, their mobile phones were snatched and a few Metro properties were also damaged, said an official.
 
 Umar then pulled out his pistol and fired a warning shot in the air. Hearing the gunshot, the people started fleeing. However, six of them were caught.
 
 DCP (Metro) Pankaj Singh said a team from the Kashmere Gate Metro police station, under which Azadpur station falls, soon reached the station and detained the six people. An FIR has been registered for preventing a public servant from conducting his duties and assaulting a public servant on duty. An inquiry has also been initiated against Umar to find out what prompted him to open fire.
