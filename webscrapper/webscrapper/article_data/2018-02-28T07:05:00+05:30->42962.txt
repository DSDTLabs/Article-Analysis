GREATER NOIDA: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) has found almost 50% of   in its area to have violated layout plans. The YIEDA had scanned 28 projects involving around 28,000 flats.

 Sources said that the   had found builders to have constructed more towers than the sanctioned number and even violating on the allowed width of roads, drains and so on. Some were found to have carved out more plots in their projects than approved in the building sanctioned plans.
 
 The audit was carried out by a committee headed by the additional CEO (ACEO) Amarnath Upadhyay. On YEIDA’s scanner were all the ongoing projects with approved building maps in the city.
 
 “I am yet to receive the report. No one will be spared. If the final report from the committee brings up the violations, the builders will be issued notices. If we do not get satisfactory responses, we will also cancel the approval of the building plans. We will even not shy away from cancelling the land allotments,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of the YEIDA.
 
 YIEDA officials said the audit had been carried out for the sake of homebuyers who are having to run pillar to post for getting possession of their long delayed flats. “We had been receiving complaints from homebuyers that several builders had violated layout plans and the approved maps,” said Singh.
 
 “These complaints included allegations that builders had constructed in green areas and not left the required area for parking as per the sanctioned plans. We had also received complaints that some builders had constructed many more units than the number sanctioned besides making constructions on additional Floor Area Ratio, creating a problem for the residents. All allegations were examined in the audit after our teams went out and inspected each project on the ground,” he added.
