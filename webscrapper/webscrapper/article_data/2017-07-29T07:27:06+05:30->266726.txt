MANALI: The   and camping by thousands of trekkers at the 14,000ft-high   in   ranges is polluting its pristine environment. The Manali-Hamta Pass-Spiti routes has become one of the busiest trek routes in India, which sees hundreds of trekkers every day during the trekking season.

 Local trek operators allege that large travel agencies from other states were sending thousands of tourists to Hamta Pass, ruining the serenity of the place. “If you want to pitch a tent anywhere on this route and you dig land, you will find buried plastic containers and bottles. The trek route has turned into a permanent path way and trekkers do not get the feel of being in the wild,” a local operator Gaurav Thakur said. Some agencies were bringing in large groups of around 100 trekkers and were camping without following environmental rules and regulations, leaving the area littered with trash.
 
 There are people who were even erecting concrete toilets in their camps, alleged some locals. HP Travel Agents Association president O P Thakur said many local agents have been complaining that some outsiders are exploiting the area without following regulations. “We have been encouraging trek operators not to take more than 30 trekkers at a time and bring back every piece of trash. They are directed to protect small plants and herbs and install toilets away from water sources. There should be no permanent construction and safety of the trekkers should be ensured,” he said.
 
 Forest department has also taken strict action against camping in the forests here. The forest guards have been asked to increase patrol and fine those without requisite permits. Kullu divisional forest officer   said the field staff had been asked to increase patrol on the busy trek routes and camping sites and to keep litter and construction in check. “All are required to pay fee and obtain permission to install camps in forest land,” he said.
