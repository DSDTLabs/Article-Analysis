BENGALURU: Former junior World No. 1   may not be the finished product yet, but he has the firepower to punch holes in the defenses of more experienced players.

 Monk-like in his   debut, the 20-year-old   lad made  ' P Kashyap huff and puff before faltering at the Koramangala Indoor Stadium.
 
 Kashyap, playing his Trump Match, gave Chennai Smashers a 3-1 lead with the win after Thai teammate Tanongsak Saensomboonsuk lost to Warriors' Hong Kong star Wing Ki Vincent Wong 11-6, 9-11, 10-12. The Brit pair of Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock levelled the tie defeating Warriors' Bodin Isara and Prajakta Sawant 11-4, 11-9.
 
 With Saina opting out and avoiding meeting Smashers' PV Sindhu, the Olympic medalist beat Rituparna Das 11-4, 11-6 to seal the tie 4-1. Warriors' V Shem Goh and Markis Kido then downed Mads Pieler Kolding and B Sumeeth Reddy 12-10, 11-8 in a Trump Match as the tie ended 4-3 in Chennai's favour.
 
 Joshi, who spent eight weeks at the summit of junior badminton in 2014, stole the show with his effort. Filling in for the rested K Srikanth, he was a player transformed following a tame first game loss.
 
 Joshi took every opportunity to stretch Kashyap in the next and didn't give him room to unleash the big smash. His net play had the 30-year-old struggling as he win the second game to draw parity.
 
 In the decider, Joshi took a 6-5 lead before errors crept in. He let his rival to go ahead 8-6 and although Kashyap mishit a smash to allow Joshi back in, the youngster's drop shot crashed into the net. Ahead at 10-7 Kashyap didn't need a second invitation.
