NAMAKKAL: “The saints had kept their silence all these days. We will not keep mum anymore. We all know how to hurl soda bottles and stones very well,” said the head of the   temple  , speaking at a meeting in Tiruchengode on Friday, condemning lyricist Vairamuthu for his statement on Hindu deity Andal.

 Vairamuthu had courted controversy for referring to Andal as a devadasi in an essay he wrote for a vernacular daily.
 
 Addressing a gathering at an event organised by   and  , the spiritual leader urged members of all Hindu forums and outfits to protest against Vairamuthu if he refused to express an apology on or before February 3. “All Hindus should raise their voice if anyone attacks Hinduism and our Gods. We should not allow them to speak like that,” he said.
 
 He also urged the saints and Hindu gurus to come out and stop those insulting Hindu religion. “We will stage an agitation if anyone insults Hindu Gods. But, we want to face all issues calmly, the ahimsa way.”
 
 Earlier, the organisers of the meeting attempted to conduct a rally near Car Street in Tiruchengode. But, police refused them permission.
