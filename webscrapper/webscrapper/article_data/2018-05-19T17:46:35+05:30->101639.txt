BENGALURU: The entire focus may be on efforts by   and JD(S) to keep their flocks together. But the ruling party fighting for survival is having jitters with many of its 104 MLAs yet to arrive in Bengaluru till late Friday evening.

 
 Asked about rumours surrounding the JD(S) and Congress poaching Vokkaliga MLAs, including first-time legislator from Hassan City J Preetham Gowda, Karandlaje said she had spoken to him around 4.30pm and that he would be coming to Bengaluru by 8pm. He’s said to have gone back to Hassan from Bengaluru on Thursday night to collect his certificate.
 
 Party sources said   had made adequate room bookings at the   hotel in   for all 104 MLAs. Most are on twin-sharing basis, with only senior members being given individual rooms. “The rooms are primarily meant for those who don’t have a place to live in the city. The old guard have their own rooms in Legislators’ Home and people like former chief minister Jagadish Shettar and others have their own houses here,” said a party worker.
