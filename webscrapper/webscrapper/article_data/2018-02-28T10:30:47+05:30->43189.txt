Just after she got through her Class XII, this Sector 40 resident left for the United States to study this art at the  , at the age of 18. Seven years on, she is back in town, teaching dance and giving performances.
 
 She has always pushed her limits and enchanted her audience. Ask her what she likes about dance and she says: “That it’s a way of communication I use to express myself.”
 
 Her tribe is increasing but who would have expected the dance scene in Chandigarh to be so alive and kicking. Take the case of 20-year-old Ankur Gharti of  , who got serious about dancing at 11. “My sister was a dancer, too, and she inspired me,” he says. “Dance is my key to fame and fortune.”
 
 For them, Tricity is home and they have no plans to move to Mumbai, dream destination of every Indian entertainer. “Of course, you won’t get the exposure here that you’d get in Mumbai. But this is home, right?” says Ankur. Anshul wants to stay in Chandigarh because he can’t abandon his mother. Devanshi, who is open to options, would still prefer to set up base in a familiar place. “Mumbai will happen, if it has to happen,” she says. Anshul milks the internet for side income, while Devanshi and Ankur give dance lessons. Ankur teaches at Vijay Public School, Sector 17, and GenNext Public School, Sector 27, in Panchkula.
 
 Two years ago, Devanshi opened a dance studio in Sector 40 and she invites artistes from Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata for special workshops in Chandigarh. “If you are smart, there’s money in dance,” she says. “I know dancers have been moving out of town for a living but I do dance because I love it. Many people choose a career for happiness instead of money,” she says. “Just be the best at what you do and make sure to work smartly.” Recently, Devanshi opened a branch of her dance studio in Mohali as well.
