NAGPUR: Shades of six seasons came alive and gave connoisseurs of music a peek into changing nature as singers and accompanying artistes gave full justice to   ‘Saha Rutunche Saha Sohale’, organized by Saptak, at Dr   on Thursday.

 Renuka Deshkar, who conceptualized and compèred the programme, explained vivid colours of six ‘rutus’ — Vasant, Greeshm, Varsha, Sharad, Shishir and Hemant — with her narrative and the songs thereon. A packed hall gave thunderous applause to the songs that depicted the nature so beautifully rendered. 
 
 The programme began with the felicitation of artistes at the hands of Vikas Sirpurkar, former judge of the Supreme Court. 
 
 ‘Ketki gulab juhi champak baan phule’, made immortal by Pt   and Manna Dey, was the first song of the programme that highlighted the onset of Vasant rutu (spring). This was followed by ‘Ghan ghan mala nabhi datalya kosalti dhara’, ‘Sawaan aaye ya na aaye’, ‘Aaj kuni tari yaave’, ‘Jaab deep jaale aana’, ‘Tora maan darpan kahalaye’, ‘Jhanak jhanak tori baje payaliya’ and many more lilting songs. All these songs were based on different raagas based on six seasons. 
 
 The singers were Aniruddha Deshpande, Sugandha Laturkar, Mukul Pandey and Shruti Chaudhary. The accompanying artistes were Shailesh Dani, Avnindra Shewalikar, Shirish Bhalerao, Valmik Dhande, Arvind Upadhyay, Sandesh Popatkar, Manish Madankar and  .
 
 Some songs were played on sitar, santoor and flute that won hearts of the audience. Said Avnindra Shewlikar, a famous sitar player, “This being the first time to perform with a large group and different instruments, I had a feeling of togetherness.” 
 
 The programme concluded with ‘Tarana’ presented in chorus that got repeated calls for ‘once more’.
