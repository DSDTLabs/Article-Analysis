Indore: The revenue of Indore Municipal Corporation has seen a rise of 12.3 per cent till the end of the third quarter of the current fiscal. The civic body managed to collect Rs 214 crore till December end. The collection during the same duration in the last fiscal was Rs 191.03 crore. The target set by the civic body is Rs 300 crore. Officials said that with the constant drives against tax evasion that are being conducted across the city, they would easily achieve the target. Moreover, data of the civic body suggest that demonetisation also played a major role in collection of taxes. Sources revealed that a lot of money was collected during the time of demonetization. Sources of IMC said that there was a significant rise in property tax collection. More than Rs 150 crore was collected as property tax alone.

A total of Rs 24 crore was collected by the water works department. “We are constantly regularizing illegal water connections in the city.
