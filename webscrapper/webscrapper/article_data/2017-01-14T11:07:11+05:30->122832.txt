CHHAPRA: Two employees of a private road construction firm were killed at their base camp in   village under Derni police station area of   district late Thursday night. The company,  , is engaged in the construction of state highway between Dighwara and Bheldi. The deceased have been identified as Dharmbir Kumar Rai (35) of Rukanpura under Fatuha police station area in Patna district and Lal Babu Mishra (55) of Matihani in Begusarai district.

 The police sources said the criminals shot Rai and Mishra dead in their sleep. People came to know about the twin murder only on Friday morning. 
 
  said, “This appears to be a case of personal enmity.” 
 
 Sonepur DSP Ali Ansari also said the miscreants did not take anything from the camp. Although it’s a Moist-dominated area, the DSP ruled out the possibilities of their involvement as no official had received any levy or related demand from the Red side. 
 
 The sources, however, said the workers engaged in the project fled from the site after the killings. “The nearby villagers are also tight-lipped,” said a police source.
 
 The bodies have been sent for postmortem. “We will be able to say anything only after getting the postmortem report,” a police officer said. 
 
 Several incidents of arson, loot and killings by the suspected Maoists have been recorded in Derni, Garkha and Amnour areas in the recent past. “Police registered cases, but no one was arrested. We are conducting raids on the possible hideouts of suspected criminals,” the DSP said.
