 Indeed, the TNRERA is already enquiring into complaints of several homebuyers over delay in delivery of units in MARG Swarnabhoomi since September 2017. But, the real estate authority in Tamil Nadu is yet to initiate any final order despite completing several rounds of hearings that witnessed the participation of the representatives of the promoter and buyers.

But, the regulatory body has not passed any final order on violating developer in the last 10 months since its inception. So far, the TNRERA has received 310 complaints from the homebuyers.
