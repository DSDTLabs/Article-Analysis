MYSURU: Although they shared the dais on Saturday , BJP state unit president BS   and leader of the opposition in the legislative council   had refused to greet one another.However, in what appeared to be a reluctant display of bonhomie on the concluding day of the party's state executive meet, the duo was seen shaking hands on Sunday .

 The two warring leaders also did not hold back in expressing their admiration for each other While   announced that Yeddyurappa was the party's chief ministerial candidate in his address, the latter showered praise on the tall   leader. “Unlike Saturday , the two lead ers were cordial to each other and their body language was vastly different as well. This is a good sign for the party,“ said a leader who attended the meet.
 
 However, shadow boxing be tween the two leaders continued along the sidelines of the meet. In a veiled attack on Yeddurappa, Es hwarappa said, “The party has failed to reach out to people in drought-affected regions. We need to have more programmes in order to accomplish this.“
 
  Party sources said that Esh warappa was absent at the pho to session where Union minister for state for commerce and industry   was present.
