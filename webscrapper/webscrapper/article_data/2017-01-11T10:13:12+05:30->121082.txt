RAJKOT: Hundreds of cash-starved villagers protested and sporadically blocked traffic on the   highway near Tankara town for two days in a row. Villagers also agitated and locked bank offices in places like Amran village of   and Navagam village of Jamnagar district. 

 In Tankara, villagers had begun protesting on Monday as they were unable to get cash from banks and ATMs even after 63 days having passed from demonetization of old Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes. They complained that most didn’t have enough cash needed to fulfil daily needs.
 
 Morbi district police detained 10 agitators, including those held on Tuesday, when they blocked the highway near Tankara.
 
 “On Tuesday, we warned all four bank branch officers that they can open their branch only if they are able to give Rs24,000 in cash to each customer, or we will force them to shut,” said  , who led the protests in Tankara town.
 
 “Today,” said Kagathara, “we have not allowed any bank branch to operate in Tankara.” 
 
 Tankara town has branches of four banks, SBI,  , Bank of Baroda and Rajkot District Cooperative Bank Ltd.
 
 “Every day, villagers have to stand in queue for hours and they just get Rs 2,000. They are unable to do their daily work because of the cash crunch. Government has failed miserably in supplying cash to people even after its repeated assurance,’’ Kagathara added. 
 
 Similarly, villagers in Amran village of Morbi district locked bank offices after bank officials said they did not have cash to give customers. In Navagam village of Kalawad taluka of Jamnagar district, villagers locked   as its officials had been unable to provide enough cash for many days. 
 
 In some places, Congress, too, joined people in their protests to highlight the hardships caused due to cash crunch after demonetization.
