Bengaluru boy and cricketer   got   over the weekend to  , the daughter of city top cop,  . “We have known each other for about seven years. Aashita is very grounded and one of the nicest people I know and that’s what I like about her the most,” says Mayank, who had a very romantic proposal at the London Eye just before the New Year.
“I had no idea that Mayank was coming to London, even though we had been talking about meeting up. Towards the end of December, his phone was not reachable for a couple of days and when I checked with him he claimed that he was having issues with the handset. He was actually on his way to London and surprised me here. The proposal also came out of the blue,” says Aashita, who has just finished her Masters in Intellectual Property Law in London.
 The engagement was a quiet affair at a city hotel with only close family and a few friends in attendance. So, have they set a date for their big day? “Not really. We need to figure out Mayank’s schedule and see when he will get a fairly long break to plan our wedding. But it will most definitely be later this year. We will get married in Bengaluru, as we are both from here,” says Aashita. Mayank adds, “My brother is getting married next month, so any planning will happen after that.”
