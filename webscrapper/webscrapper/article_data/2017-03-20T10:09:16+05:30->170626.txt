BENGALURU: The posters at railway stations seeking information about the ATM attacker have finally been removed. Madhukar Reddy, the suspect who attacked a woman in a cash vending kiosk in November 2013, is back in judicial custody after all police procedures, including the identification parade, are over. 

 While investigators are preparing a chargesheet to build a water-tight case against Reddy, sources did not rule out the possibility of the suspect being taken back to   given the cases against him there. The cases, including murder, are pending against Reddy in Andhra Pradesh and he might be taken back as part of investigation by   police after obtaining a body warrant. However, so far no such requests have been made, said senior officers.
 
  If there are no such requests, he will remain in Bengaluru till the end of the trial. With Reddy's track record of having escaped from prison once, security will be tighter. 
 
 Though there were 217 murders reported in the city during 2013, the ATM attack drew attention as gruesome   images of banker Jyothi Uday being attacked with a machete went viral, even making it to global TV. 
 
 On Friday, Jyothi Uday identified her attacker after three years, from a line-up of five people. The attacker had stolen Jyothi's cellphone and sold it to a man named Mujeeb, who has also identified Reddy. 
 
 Chandragupta, deputy commissioner of police (central), said the machete used by the attacker was recovered by AP police. "As part of the investigation, there's is a provision to obtain the weapon. There's is no information on his involvement in any other crime in the city," he said.
