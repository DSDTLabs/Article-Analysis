BENGALURU: The   retained the   assembly constituency in Bengaluru with N   defeating PM   (BJP) by 25,492 votes.

 
 Polling in the constituency was deferred to May 28 after 10,000 electoral photo identity cards were found in a flat
 
 in Jalahalli on May 9, three days before the polls. Muniratna was booked for electoral malpractice. “The results prove the allegations are motivated and that the people are with me,” Muniratna said.
 
 The Congress and JD(S) — alliance partners ruling Karnataka — decided to fight against each other in   and CM HD Kumaraswamy described it as ‘friendly fight’. The strategy paid off as the presence of JD(S) candidate GH Ramachandra is believed to have resulted in a division of Vokkaliga votes between JD(S) and BJP and consolidation of Congress votes. “I’m happy the result is in favour of Congress-JD(S) combine. We stopped the BJP,” the CM said.
 
 With this, the Congress tally in the assembly has gone up to 78. The party had 78 MLAs when results were announced on May 15. The number came down to 77 after Jamkhandi MLA Siddu Nyamagouda died in a road accident. The Congress-JD(S) combine’s strength is now 114 with JD(S) having 36 MLAs and its alliance partner, BSP, one. The combine is backed by one independent and another MLA representing a minor party.
