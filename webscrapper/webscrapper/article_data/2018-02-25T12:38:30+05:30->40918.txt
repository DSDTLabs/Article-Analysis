BARGARH: One of the four persons who were injured in pre-poll violence in the   assembly segment on Thursday died on Saturday. 

 The deceased - Dileswar Sahu, alias Maagi - was part of a group comprising   Singh, the younger brother of state labour minister and BJD leader  , and his aides   and Khageswar Mahamallik which was attacked by unidentified miscreants in the run-up to Saturday's byelection. He died in SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.
 
 The minister's brother and the others had gone to   village, under Sohela police station near Bijepur, after getting information that some people were distributing money among the electorate. When they reached the village, they were attacked with bricks and stones. Their vehicle, being driven by Dileswar, was damaged.
 
 All four sustained injuries and were taken to Veer Surendra Sai Institute of Medical Sciences and Research (Vimsar) in Burla. Dileswar was referred to SCB after his condition deteriorated.
 
 Police have arrested three persons in connection with the violence. The BJD has accused   of orchestrating the attack.
 
 IGP (Northern Range) Susant Nath said police will invoke murder charges against the attackers. "Around 20 to 25 people were in the group that attacked the minister's brother and his friends. Some people from Chhattisgarh and Sambalpur were also there," he said.
 
 Subrat and his aides are currently undergoing treatment at the trauma centre in Vimsar.
