VADODARA:   was detained along with former   MP Prabha Taviad in   for holding protests against the Zydus Hospital and Medical College. The duo along with others was opposing the privatisation of the hospital that was earlier state run.

 Mevani had reached Dahod on Saturday afternoon and was joined by Taviad in protests in the bus depot area. The group was, however, prevented from going further and was detained. They were taken to the Dahod town police station.
 
 A row took place at the police station when supporters of Taviad allegedly misbehaved with the media persons there. The media persons were reportedly threatened by some persons present at the police station. They later made representations regarding the issue to the Dahod superintendent of police.
 
 Mevani and other protestors were allowed to go later in the day. The protests against the hospital were triggered after a couple of deaths recently. 
 
 The district administration, however, holds that the condition in the hospital has only improved after the public private partnership arrangement was implemented. The deaths have also been attributed to the fact that he cases were very serious and two of them were suicide bids.
