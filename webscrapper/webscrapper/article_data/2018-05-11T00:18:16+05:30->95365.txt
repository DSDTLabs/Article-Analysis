Jaisalmer: The Gudamalani town in Barmer district is fraught with tension after an apparent love jihad incident where a Muslim youth ran away with a minor Hindu girl studying in class XI on April 8.

 The entire town remained shut in a Bandh-like situation in protest and Sarva Hindu Samaj took out an Aakrosh rally and submitted a memorandum to Barmer SP Gagandeep Singla demanding to locate the girl within 24 hours. Police have already formed five teams and sent them to different places. They have also called a few people for questioning.
 
 The memorandum submitted by the Samiti states that the Muslim boy and his friends had gone to Delhi few days ago and other cities and took training from various Muslim organisations and have also taken economic assistance. They have also uploaded photos on social media. They said earlier too Muslim organisations have given shape to such incidents.
 
 They said prima facie it appears to be a case of love jihad and demanded immediate action. They have warned police to locate the couple within 24 hours otherwise the agitation will be intensified.
 
 Gudamalani SHO Jaikishan Soni said the couple had been good friends since the past one year.
