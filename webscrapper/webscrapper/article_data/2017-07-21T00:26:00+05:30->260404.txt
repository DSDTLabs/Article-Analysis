Chandigarh: Panjab University is contemplating going department-wise for   hike. This was discussed in the first meeting of the joint committee set to decide fee for the PU-affiliated colleges and the university departments here on Thursday.

 Sources said that the members in the meeting pointed out that there were departments on the university campus, which needed infrastructure upliftment. Interestingly, these were departments where students were willing to pay more fee. So, it was discussed in the meeting that the university could think of going department-wise to decide the fee.
 
 Moreover, several other problems of colleges were discussed in the meeting. It was pointed out that sustenance and development were the big issues before colleges. It was discussed that the colleges had a fee hike of 2.5% in 2015 and no fee hike in 2016 and resultantly, no salaries had been paid to the staff of the colleges for months together. The sources said that it was discussed in the meeting that on one hand development was necessary for which fee needs to be increased, whereas on the other hand fee hike wonâ€™t be acceptable by students. Since it is a tricky issue, it needs to be discussed extensively before taking any decision, said sources. 
 
 Since this was the first meeting of the joint committee of the colleges and university, only deliberations were made. The joint committee had been formed for rationalising fee of colleges and departments of the university.
