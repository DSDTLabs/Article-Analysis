 And you know what happened? After ten days on 16th of December 2016, I heard the news that Mrs.   revealed that her production is making a film based on his life, starring AKSHAY KUMAR,”
 
  
 
 He further wrote, “Recently, the PADMAN trailer released, and most of the scenes has been taken from the summary I had sent to MR. Ryan stephan. Yes, they even copied my fictional scenes(Check out the Rakshabandan scene. In real life, Arunachalam Muruganantham has no sister.)
