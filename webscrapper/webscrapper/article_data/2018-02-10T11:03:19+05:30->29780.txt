HYDERABAD:   will get 17.9 tmc feet water from river Krishna to meet the irrigation and drinking water needs in February. At the same time, the Krishna River Management Board (KRMB) also allocated an identical 17.09 tmc feet water for Andhra Pradesh for the same period. With meagre reserves in Srisailam and  , both states have to utilise the available water till fresh inflows start in July.

 The KRMB also asked the two states to follow its schedule to ensure sufficient reserves for summer.
 
 
 
  
 
 
 Both states have to take water from Srisailam reservoir which should be released through the right canal power house station. This means AP will get the opportunity to continue power generation while releasing the water in February.
 
 The left canal power house is under the control of Telangana and presently, the two states are operating their hydel power stations at Srisailam to release more than 19,900 cusecs per day. While AP has reported a peak generation of 385 MW from the right canal power house, TGenco has generated 706 MW through the left canal power house.
 
 KRMB has said that a total of 34.99 tmc feet water should be released from Srisailam reservoir in February. Though AP has requested for 27.12 tmc feet water for its February needs, the Board after calculating the water already utilised through Pothireddypadu, Muchumarri and   projects, has allowed only 17.09 tmc feet. Telangana has already made a complaint on over-utilisation by AP and found fault with KRMB for not acting on its complaint.
 
 On Friday, Srisailam had a total storage of 90.98 tmc feet water with the level hovering at 854.7 feet against the Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 885 feet. At Nagarjunasagar, the water level is 526.8 feet against the FRL of 590 feet. The dam has a total storage of 162 tmc feet.
