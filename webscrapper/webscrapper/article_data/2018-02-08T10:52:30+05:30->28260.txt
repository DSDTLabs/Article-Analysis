NAGPUR: As a last chance to advocate  , the Supreme Court on Wednesday permitted him to tender an unconditional apology before the   judges for scandalizing the court and vilifying the judicial process. He had been convicted for contempt by the Nagpur bench in February last year, and sentenced to two months imprisonment.

 The apex court’s division bench comprising justices   and Navin Sinha granted him the last opportunity while hearing his review petition filed through senior counsel  , former HRD minister in UPA government. Uke was charged with abusing the legal process by filing fake and frivolous litigations before the HC.
 
 The petitioner gained a notorious reputation of moving various applications, seeking transfer of cases, asking judges to recuse, seeking exemption from appearing in court, and adjournments to move the SC. After showing leniency for a considerable period, the HC moved a suo motu contempt petition initiated by justice  .
 
 The contemnor was convicted by the HC and entire proceeding was videotaped, making it the first ever such instance in the history of Nagpur bench. He was subsequently sentenced to two months simple imprisonment under Section 12 of Contempt of Courts Act.
 
 After being convicted and issuance of a non-bailable warrant against him, Uke has been absconding for nearly a year. His property was seized and deposit of Rs2 lakh with HC registry was also forfeited. The contemnor also attempted to overturn his conviction before the principal bench in Mumbai, but the Chief Justice slammed him for bench hunting and forum shopping. The lawyer has over Rs4 lakh unpaid fines, imposed by the court from time to time for failure to comply with its directives.
 
 On August 8 last year, Uke filed a criminal appeal before the apex court to challenge the HC conviction, which was promptly dismissed by division bench of justices Gogoi and Sinha while upholding the HC’s verdict.
