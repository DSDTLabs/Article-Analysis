VADODARA: She was to take vows with her to be   on Wednesday evening, but the woman decked-up as a bride reached   police station in the afternoon to give a complaint against the man with whom she was deeply in love. She reached police station after she learnt that the groom had fled home without informing anyone.

 The woman, who worked at a call centre in the city, was in relationship with the man for two years. When they decided to get married, they put the proposal to their parents for their permission. But, when the match was rejected by their parents they secretly married in court last year. Later, they informed their families about it and they too accepted the marriage.
 
 It was then decided to marry as per traditional rituals. On Wednesday when the wedding was to take place, the girl called the boy when she was leaving for the marriage hall from her home. But instead of the boy, his father answered the call and told her that he was not home. When she enquired further, his father said that he has left without informing anyone.
 
 The girl then approached the cops. The police called the boy’s father and brother who told the police that he had left home in the morning.
 
 The police have taken the girl’s application to register complaint and are searching for the man.
