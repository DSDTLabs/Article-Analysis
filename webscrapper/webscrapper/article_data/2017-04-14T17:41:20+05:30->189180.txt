NAGPUR: Prime Minister   on Friday said Deekshabhoomi, where Bharat Ratna Dr Babasaheb   embraced the Buddhism in 1956, would continue to motivate crores of Indians. He wrote these words in the visitors’ book after visiting the historic place to pay tributes to the architect of the Indian constitution on his 126th birth anniversary at Deekshabhomi in Nagpur. He said he felt privileged and honoured of visiting the historic site and paying tribute to the Dalit icon.

 He was accompanied by Maharashtra Governor Ch   Rao, chief minister  , Union minister for road, shipping and transport Nitin Gadkari, union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar, social justice minister Ramdas Athawale, and MP Kripal Tumane accompanied him.
 
 The Prime Minister’s convoy arrived at Deekshabhoomi at 10.45 am. He was welcomed by Deekshabhoomi Smarak Samiti secretary Vilas Gajghate. He informed the PM and other guests about the historic place. He paid floral tributes to Dr Ambedkar’s urn and statue of Gautam Buddha. He also meditated for a while near the statue. Afterwards Deekshabhoomi Smarak Samiti president Arya Bhadant Surai Sasai, Sadanand Fulzele and other members felicitated the PM.
 
 Modi then took a round of Deekshabhoomi and also garlanded Dr Ambedkar’s statue outside along with Fadnavis. He greeted a big crowd who thronged the venue since morning to catch his glimpse. Many climbed atop trees and nearby buildings to have a look. All of them were however, disappointed as PM’s special protection group denied entry to anyone inside the premises. Even media was barred entry.
