NEW DELHI: With the BJP looking to give a final push to its bid to unseat the Manik Sarkar-led Left government in  , PM   will address two rallies on Thursday, the penultimate day of campaigning for the February 18 poll. 

 “There was a time when 20-25 people used to gather and the party was satisfied with it. But most rallies of the party president had a turnout of over 20,000 people,” BJP’s national media coordinator Anil Baluni, who accompanied party chief   on his twoday Tripura visit, claimed. 
 
 Modi was in the northeastern state last week and will visit again while Shah held several public meetings and roadshows. Home minister  , highways minister Nitin Gadkari and Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath have been key campaigners for the party. For the BJP, which got less than 2% of votes in the last assembly polls, the task at hand could not be more arduous. 
 
 The Left got over 50% of votes last time and CM Manik Sarkar has a standing that surmounts the common refrain about lack of employment, development, and basic issues of drinking water and electricity. The state has been under Left rule since 1978 barring a five-year period between 1988-93 and Sarkar has been at the helm since 1998. 
 
 If the Left is promising continuity with its focus on rural development and the poor, the BJP has let it be known that with the party in power at the Centre, it can shower the state with goodies and funds which the CPM can’t. “When finance minister Arun Jaitley released our vision document and promised that government employees will get salaries as per seventh pay commission and not fourth, which is the case now, then it is clear that we mean business,” state BJP president Biplab Deb said. Jaitley had released the document on Sunday. 
 
 The CPM, on its part, has termed the BJP’s promises, including smartphones for the youth, a ‘jumla’ (poll rhetoric).
