PUNE: Bhushan Ahire of Nashik more than made up for the heartbreak of having missed becoming a class I officer by just one mark two years ago when he topped the state in this year's   (MPSC) examination. The results were declared on Thursday evening. 

 The 29-year-old Ahire scored 526 marks to be selected as a deputy collector.   of Pandharpur finished second with 522 marks while   was first among the women candidates with 507 marks. Patil, an engineer, has been selected for the post of deputy superintendent of police.
 
 Ahire, who hails from Gorane village in Satana, Nashik, completed his engineering and subsequently spent four-and-a-half years preparing for the MPSC exam. His mother is a zilla parishad teacher and his father a primary school principal at Gorane.
 
 An elated Ahire told TOI, "The one mark I lost two years ago had dashed all my hopes. However, since it was my parents' dream to see me become a class I officer, I decided to give the exam another shot. Topping the state was never on my mind as I was still reeling from the one-mark loss."
