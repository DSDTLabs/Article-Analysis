 The girl, who used to stay with her 60-year-old father and 25-year-old stepmother in Loni, was found loitering near the railway station in Jaipur in December last year and was handed over to child welfare committee in Ghaziabad by its counterpart in Jaipur. Subsequently, the CWC wrote to the police to file an FIR against the minorâ€™s father and mother.
