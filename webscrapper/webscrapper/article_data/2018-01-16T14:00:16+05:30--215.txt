RAIPUR: RSS chief  , who is on a three-day visit to  , was hit with questions on Twitter by the state   chief   on Monday. 

 Launching attack via his tweets, Baghel asked five questions from Bhagwat. Baghel questioned, Wouldn't RSS chief speak on BJP government hogging upon commission on the donations meant for cows? Wouldn't he speak on the game of loot taking place in the name of cows? In his second tweet, Baghel asked, I would like to know RSS's opinion on Raman Singh government's monopoly on retailing of liquor in Chhattisgarh. Isn't selling liquor against Indian culture?
 
 Asking Bhagwat about his opinion on safety of women, Baghel said, "27,000 women and girls missing in Chhattisgarh. Though women have no place in Sangh, does that indicate that women are unsafe in all the BJP-ruled states?
 
 In his fourth question, Congress chief said that the tribals in Bastar come under crossfire of police and Maoists, women, children face torture and atrocities at high level. While many wings of Sangh have been claiming to have been working for tribals, why are they silent over atrocities on tribals in Bastar ? He expressed surprise in his fifth question over silence of RSS on serious cases of corruption by BJP ministers in the state. Has Sangh become the provider to corruption? TNN
