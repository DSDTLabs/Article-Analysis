CHARMINAR:   (MIM) president,  , on Tuesday said the crux of the   -   case is a title dispute and that it must not be confused with a 'partnership case'. 

 Reacting to the  's suggestion that all parties on both sides of the dispute settle the case by means of arbitration, the Hyderabad parliamentarian took to Twitter to say: "Please remember Babri Masjid case is about Title which Allahabad court wrongly decided as a Partnership case hence the Appeal in Apex court ( sic)." 
 
 Later in the day, Owaisi spoke to TOI and said that the apex court should deal with the contempt petition, which has been pending for around 25 years. He wondered if charges against senior   leaders such as M M Joshi, L K Advani and Uma Bharti allegedly involved in the conspiracy case will be held. 
 
 "The   (AIMPLB) has observed that talks were held six times. This did not result in anything. The case should be heard on a day-to-day basis. The court should hear the case during the (summer) vacations like it is going to hear the oral triple talaq case," Owaisi said reiterating that the case is a title dispute and not a case of aastha. 
 
 On the other hand, the AIMPLB's   (CBM) exercised caution while reacting to the apex court's suggestion. 
 
 New Delhi-based Syed Qasim Rasool Ilyas, convener, CBM said, "We are not rejecting the offer of arbitration or mediation as it is the Chief Justice of India J S Khehar who has offered. However, we should be given equal status and there is no preconceived notion or position. Arbitration should be done based on evidence and not aastha. It has been our experience that six times talks have not yielded any result." The committee is pursuing seven petitions in connection with the Babri Masjid - Ram Janmabhoomi case, he added.
