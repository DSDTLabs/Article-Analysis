Vadodara: Three constables of Varnama police station were attacked by a bootlegger and his aides when they went to raid him at Ratanpur village in Vadodara taluka late on Saturday night. Besides the cops, the bootlegger Hitesh alias Pappu Jaiswal also injured himself when he ran behind the PCR van when the former were trying to escape from the village.
