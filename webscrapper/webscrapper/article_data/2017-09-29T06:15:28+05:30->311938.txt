RAJKOT: Vain attempts to recover Rs 19 lakh which he had lent to his friend and his uncle drove   (24) to  , said police on Thursday. 

 Police have booked Rishi Nathwani and his friend’s uncle Jitu Nathwani under sections 306, 587, 406, 420, 506(2) and 114 of the Indian Penal Code on the complaint of Parth’s father Praful Thakarar. 
 
 In his complaint, Thakarar alleged that Parth had lent Rs 19 lakh to the Nathwani duo who had not returned the money after the stipulated time period. 
 
 “When Parth asked for the money, the duo threatened to book him under a false case and demanded Rs 3 lakh more if he did not want to be implicated in the case. When Parth’s wife approached the Nathwani duo and beseeched them to clear the dues, saying if they did not pay up, Parth would be left with no choice but to commit suicide, the duo allegedly told her to come when he ended his life,” said an official from Aji Dam police station, where the case in this regard has been registered. 
 
 After this, Parth committed suicide by jumping into Aji Dam on September 21.
