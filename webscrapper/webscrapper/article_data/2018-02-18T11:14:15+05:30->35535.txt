Ludhiana: In a major crackdown against GST evasion, zonal unit of the directorate general of GST intelligence (DGGI) on Friday surveyed a local a real estate group that has a project on canal road.

 Department sources said the survey was conducted under the instructions from DGGI’s additional director general Gurusharan Singh after getting specific inputs that the group has been collecting receipts worth crores from the buyers in lieu of sale of property in their township and had charged GST from them on sales. But he did not deposit the GST to the government.
 
 The survey ended after the group agreed to pay the amount and deposited close to Rs 85 lakh on the spot to DGGI officials to evade strict action.
 
 This is one of the highest GST recoveries by the DGGI. Sources revealed that several other real estate groups are also on department’s radar as they have got inputs that groups have usurped GST paid by clients on purchase of properties.
 
 Nitin Saini, additional director of department, refused to comment on the issue.
 
 The survey on the real estate group comes days after DGGI arrested a Gobindgarh-based businessman for his involvement into a central excise duty fraud involving crores of rupees in which he cheated the government of Rs 7 crore tax by running a nexus of supplying fake purchase bills of non-existent firms to 20 companies based in   and other locations who used to claim central excise duty from government by showing the tax paid on their purchases.
