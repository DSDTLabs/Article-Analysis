 The 49-year-old actress believes her husband   and their children Faith, six, and Sunday, eight, would not be able to survive without her.
 
 "Keith is the rock but I'm very much the glue. I mean, I hate to say it, but yeah, you're the heartbeat of the family.   says it. The girls say it. They just like when I'm at home. There's just that female energy in the house, which is powerful",   said. 
 
 The actress said she has decided to keep her children out of the spotlight because she likes the 'privacy' that comes with her family.
