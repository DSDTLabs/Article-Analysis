AHMEDABAD: While some   and   drivers have decided to resume work out of helplessness, a large chunk of drivers associated with the   continued their strike. Some 3,500 cab drivers who are part of the association of drivers associated with cab aggregators have been on   for the past six days, seeking an increase in their payments.

 “We used to get a certain compensation per hour earlier, in addition to our earning from each trip. Subtracting 25% commission, we made a handsome sum which sustained us. The company recently cut its prices and discontinued the hourly payments and other incentives, while keeping the commission at 25%. It is not possible to sustain ourselves on such meagre payments,” said a member of the association, on condition of anonymity.
 
 “While most members won’t resume work from Saturday, some who recently bought cars and have to pay EMIs are helpless and are forced to get back to work,” he added.
 
 Cab owners say they submitted a memorandum to the state transport ministry three months ago, to regularize cab tariffs however. While they had been assured of it, drivers issues have not been redressed yet.
 
 Ever since the cabbies went on strike, customers dependent on cabs for their daily commute are having a tough time, especially as temperatures rise. 
 
 “In the 43°C heat, having no cabs available is a nightmare. I don’t have a vehicle of my own and my job involves travelling. I can’t even find a rickshaw most of the time. It is difficult to travel around,” said Falguni Patel, a city-based fashion consultant.
 
 “I don’t have a car and commute by two-wheeler. Cabs were my means to take my aging mother to the hospital. She is suffering from dehydration due to the heat and I thought I’ll could take her to the hospital by cab but none were available,” said Saurabh Deshpande, a resident of Thaltej.
