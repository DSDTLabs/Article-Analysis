JAIPUR: The state education department is set to push its human resource (teachers) to make   (admission festival) a success with record breaking admissions in the election year.

 The tentative dates for the festival are May 1 to 19 and June 19 to 30. The department has hinted that they would give teachers different outreach activities to reach out to families to enroll their wards.
 
 They will carry out ‘prabhat pheres’ (awareness programme) in areas highlighting the importance of education, achievements made by respective schools to convince parents to admit their children.
 
 Other than sending teachers for door-to-door activities, they will be asked to find out about drop-outs and admit them again.
 
 By activating school management committees, gram panchayats in rural areas,   and NGOs, the department hopes to ensure that no child is left behind in the special enrolment drive. Every teacher will be given a target of at least 20 students from their locality who are school dropouts and illiterate, said a department source.
 
 The admission festival has been a fruitful exercise for the education department to increase enrolments. “Our target is not to leave a single child behind. Since the government schools have seen a makeover, it has helped in winning the hearts of parents and increased enrolments,” said  .
 
 Enrolments and learning outcomes have become major ‘political’ parameters for judging education. After reversing the trend in enrolments and improving learning outcomes (NAS achievement survey), the department wants to leave no room for the   to raise any issue on education. The government has claimed to have added 18 lakh more students compared to private schools after they came to power in 2013.
