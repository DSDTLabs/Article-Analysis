NEW DELHI: All   or shops   anywhere in the country will have to get registered and follow certain do's and don'ts to ensure that these aquatic creatures are kept in hygienic conditions.

 The government has made registration compulsory by notifying new rules to regulate aquarium and fish tank animals (live fish or other live aquatic animals) under provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. Local animal welfare boards will have the power to grant registration.
 
 The registration rules are, however, not meant for people who keep   inside their homes or private areas.The rules will only be applicable for aquariums on public display or for shops selling fish tank animals.
 
 “Though such registration is not meant for people having aquariums inside their houses, they are also supposed to adhere to certain do's and don'ts to prevent cruelty. They must procure fish tank animals only from registered shops,“ said Gauri Maulekhi whose petition in the Delhi high court resulted in the notification of new rules.
 
 As far as dog breeding is concerned, the rules mandate obtaining of a certificate of registration from local animal welfare board for breeding activity, ow ning or housing dogs for breeding or for sale of dogs and pups.
 
 Under the Dog Breeding and Marketing Rules, such a certificate will be valid for a period of one year and it will not be transferable. The rules require the breeder to maintain records of all the animals housed in an establishment including the dogs being used for breeding and for sale.
