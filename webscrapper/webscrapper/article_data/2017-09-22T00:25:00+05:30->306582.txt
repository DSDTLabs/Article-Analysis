Madurai: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has reserved its order on a batch of cases relating to setting up amenities for devotees coming to the world famous Sri Rameswaram temple, safety of Pamban bridge and settlement at Dhanushkodi by directing the commissioner of the state’s Hindu religious and charitable endowment (HR&CE) and the executive officer of Lord Sri Ramanathaswamy temple to appear before it on Friday. 

 The division bench of justices K K Sasidharan and J Nishabanu heard the cases on Thursday. When the court asked about the presence of HR&CE commissioner, it was informed that the commissioner was at a meeting in the temple to address the issue of mixing of sewage water into Agni theertham (sea). 
 
 This drew the court’s ire. It said, “Regarding the issues the court had inspected the places concerned and specifically posted the cases for hearing on Thursday. It was expected that the HR&CE commissioner and the executive officer would appear before the court during the hearing. But both of them did not turn up. They should appear before the court on Friday.”
 
 The government side then told the court that already a proposal for providing underground sewerage system with sewage treatment plant at a cost of Rs 50 crore is awaiting approval of the government.
 
 It also said the proposal to provide a new road at the south of the temple from Agni theertham to telephone exchange to ease congestion has been returned to furnish the proposal along with clearance under the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification, 2011. 
 
 Following it the court reserved its order. However it would pass interim order with some directions. TNN
