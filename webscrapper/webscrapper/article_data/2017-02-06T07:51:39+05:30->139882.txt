HOWRAH: The   on Sunday kicked off a pilot project to generate development funds and employment by angling -a   (fish hooks).

 The proposed project aims to take over nearly 250 ponds and lakes in HMC's zone that have either been abandoned or have no claimants, clean them up and lease them to private individuals annually to breed fish. It is, therefore, expected to generate employment. As part of this project,   released fishlings in HMC's   in Ward 45. HMC has spent Rs 10 lakh to clean this 11-bigha waterbody.
 
 HMC's development adviser  , said, “ According to a preliminary HMC survey, we have about 250 ponds and lakes in out area. These have have been abandoned. The HMC will now clean these waterbodies and make them fit for fishing. It will then lease them out on a yearon-year basis. The lease amount will help fund the development and beautification projects in the particular ward where the waterbody lies. The effort today is a pilot project to understand how much funds can be generated from such efforts.“
 
 Mayor Chakraborty said, “The idea is to develop self-sustaining models to generate funds.Apart from the state grants and HMC's own revenue, we need more funds to develop Howrah. This is one among them.“
 
 He also said: “The ponds we have identified have no claimants or records. They are lying abandoned. These are not only polluting the environment but may be filled up by unscrupulous developers hitting the ecological balance. So this project also wants to put an end to that.“
