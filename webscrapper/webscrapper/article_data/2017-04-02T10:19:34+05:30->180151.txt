HYDERABAD: Mild tension prevailed at a public hearing (gram sabha), conducted by   (GHMC) and revenue authorities, for acquiring 13 properties for the much-delayed Charminar Pedestrainisation Project (CPP). Most property owners refused to part with their land.

 Officials had identified 13 properties to be acquired at two locations for the ongoing CPP. The Hyderabad district administration had issued a notification on March 6 for conducting 'social impact assessment' (SIA) to acquire eight properties for the proposed 30-feet road between   and Mittika Sher (opp  ) and five pro perties for widening the stretch between   temple and  .
 
 The property owners got in a heated argument with the GHMC officials stating that they have been running their businesses for several decades and parting with land would hit their livelihood. “We will lose our livelihood if we part with our land,“ a shop owner said. “We will oppose the CPP ,“ another property owner said.
 
 Ghansi Bazar corporator Renu Soni, who attended the grama sabha said, “The shop keepers are not willing to part with their land for CPP. The government has to rethink on the project and take a decision.“
 
 The public hearing was conducted by the GHMC-Land Acquisition authorities as the civic body has taken up the CPP. As per a survey conducted to acquire land between Laad Bazar and Mittika Sher, eight properties would lose land between 3.74 square feet and 124 sq feet, while for the Char Kaman temple-Agra Hotel stretch, the property owners would have to part between 9.37 sq feet and 59 sq feet.
 
 “As per Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement (LARR) Act 2013, we have to conduct SIA. After taking views of property owners likely to be affected into consideration, a final report will be prepared,“ GHMC land acquisition officer P Chandraiah told STOI.
