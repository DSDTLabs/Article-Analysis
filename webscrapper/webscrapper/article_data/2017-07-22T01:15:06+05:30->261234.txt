MUMBAI: In yet another chance to make corrections to first year junior college (FYJC) application forms, the   will set up a kiosk at   in   on July 26 and 27 for students who were rejected admission due to discrepancies in information submitted. 

 “The   will be verified and the corrections will be made to the online form so that the students do not get rejected in the next round as well. Junior colleges have to give students a system generated receipt in case they are rejecting admission. Students with this receipt will be able to make corrections,” explained BB Chavan, deputy director of education, Mumbai. 
 
 The education department had allowed corrections to be made to applications for three days before the first merit list was announced. In spite of this, in the first round of admission, over 250 students were rejected admission. “We received applications from students that corrections were to be made in their applications,” said Chavan. “In some cases, the corrections are not reflecting in the system in spite of the software agency being informed. A lot of students applied under a certain quota but do not have the necessary documents when they go to the college to seek admission.”
 
 On July 26 and 27, all students will also be able to make changes to the selection of colleges ahead of the third merit list which will be announced on July 29.
