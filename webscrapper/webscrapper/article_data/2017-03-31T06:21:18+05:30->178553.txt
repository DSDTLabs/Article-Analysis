Kolkata: To give equal weightage to the Class XI final examinations and Class XII test examinations   for   Examination (WBCHE) has decided to change the number division from next year. The final call will be taken after a discussion with chief minister  .

 According to the proposal, that will be sent to education minister   next week, the council has decided to allot 10 marks for Class XI final examinations and XII test examinations. The marks secured by the students in these examinations will be added in the percentage along with the marks secured in the higher secondary examinations.
 
 “Currently, in science stream 70 marks is allotted for written exam and 30 marks for practicals. For commerce and arts, 80 marks is allotted for theoretical and 20 marks for project. Initially it has been decided this ten marks will be taken from the practical for science students and from the project for the arts and commerce students,” a source in the council said.
 
 “Education minster said he will give a final decision after discussing the proposal with the chief minister,” said   president.
 
 The sources added, it has been observed higher secondary students occasionally lose interest in the Class XI examination and test because of their apparent irrelevance to marks. “There is a natural tendency to skip Class XI syllabus and prepare only for higher secondary,” the source said. However, educationalists fear the weightage given to class XI or test examination might have a flip side as the marks entirely depends on the choice of the school. Thus, there may be a tendency of over marking giving the students an edge in the higher secondary.
