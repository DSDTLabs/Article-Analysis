JALANDHAR: If AAP and SAD have lost Punjab assembly elections, the worst hit among key parties that were in the contest appears to be BJP even though it got a majority in politically important Uttar Pradesh. 

 The party’s vote share has dipped to its lowest since the 1997 elections, when its performance was highest in terms of getting MLAs elected and vote share. In 1997, the party got 19 MLAs and 8.33% vote share. However, in this election, BJP’s vote share fell to 5.4%. Even in the 2014 parliamentary elections, the party had a vote share of 8.5%. 
 
 The loss would come as a major setback for the party when it comes to ambitions of spreading its wings in the state. After winning the 2014 Haryana assembly electoons, internal meetings of the party resonated with the tagline: “Haryana to jhanki hai, Punjab abhi baaki hai (Haryana is only a trailer, Punjab is still left).” The party was on a high due to its performance in the 2014 general elections, and then the victory in Haryana had come like an icing on the cake.
 
 With the BJP’s influence rising, its leaders even started building pressure on SAD and started advising leaders of its alliance partner to resign from the state cabinet who were facing probe in synthetic drug racket case. When the assembly elections started approaching, its leaders got on the back foot and joined SAD in claiming that Punjab was being defamed on the issue of drugs. 
 
 During Haryana election former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu, who later parted ways due to his strong opposition to SAD, also attacked SAD at BJP rallies in Haryana elections for aligning with INLD and “backstabbing” BJP. “After the general elections and the party’s performance in Haryana, our workers wanted to go alone in Punjab, but then the top leadership did not want to disturb the alliance because it considered the tie-up not just political, but social also,” said a senior BJP leader.
