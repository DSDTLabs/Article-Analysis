Nagpur: Prakash  , member of Legislative Council (MLC), and his supporters, have demanded prompt arrest of leaders who fomented the riot at Bhima Koregaon on January 1. The Nationalist Congress Party leader also staged a demonstration at Samvidhan chowk after the incident wearing black badges.

 Gajbhiye, who led the silent protest in front of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar statue, strongly criticized the stone-pelting on innocent Ambedkarites who had assembled at Bhima-Koregaon to pay obeisance at the war memorial. In a press note, Gajbhiye condemned the incident as a blot on humanity. 
 
 Appealing to maintain peace, Gajbhiye stated that some political forces were trying to take advantage by dividing Dalit and Maratha communities. Gajbhiye, also at the helm of the NCPâ€™s state minority cell, said on the occasion that police had already known of the developments taking place in Pune and the violence could have been prevented. Despite knowing the instigators trying to vitiate the situation, the police did not take any precaution at Bhima-Koregaon leading to major clashes that later spread to other parts of the state too. The leader appealed to the people not to follow rumours. 
 
 Gajbhiye also demanded a thorough probe by an independent agency like State CID to take action against the communally motivated leadership.
