Reality TV personality   fears her daughter  , who is rumoured to be pregnant, is being "exploited" by her employees in her own home.

 Kylie called her mother to inform her that she caught one of her employees taking photos of her in her own home. Kris is upset about it, reports femalefirst.co.uk.
 
 "I really feel bad for Kylie because there's always somebody that's trying to exploit a certain situation," Kris said.
 
 "To have somebody in her own home trying to snap pictures they shouldn't be snapping is really, really stressful. You want to be able to trust the people that you're surrounded by, but we have to really be on alert at all time, and that's extremely upsetting when you feel like you can't be in your own bedroom or bathroom."
 
 
  
 The 62-year-old pondered whether she should be getting police involved.
 
 She questioned: "Should we have her arrested?"
 
 Kris was also stressed over son  's custody dispute with former fiancee Blac   over their daughter Dream, 14 months.
 
 She said: "I've got kids with problems, I can't stay anywhere for more than five minutes! I swear to God, I'm going to lock myself in a funny farm. There's just a lot going on. It's Rob and the whole custody thing, and settling, and it's just wild. 
  
 "It's stressful, because at the end of the day, I'm trying to help him navigate this because he's never gone through anything like this before."
