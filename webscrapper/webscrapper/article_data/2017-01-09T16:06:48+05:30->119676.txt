Singer   made the most of her trip to   and took selfies with baby  . 

 The 24-year-old pop star posted the picture of herself with two of the calves on her Instagram. 
 
  
  
 ' !!!' she captioned the picture. 
 Lovato then posted a selfie with one of the elephants, where one could see just the trunk of the animal, resting on her shoulder and touching her face. 
 
 She also wrote, "Caption this. Wait actually... don't." 
 
 
  
 
 This wasn't Lovato's first trip to Kenya. In 2013, she had spent ten days as a participant in a volunteer trip sponsored by the Me to We and Free the Children organisations. 
 She also is a celebrity ambassador to these organisations. 
 
 Three years ago, she had celebrated her 21st birthday in Kenya and received a goat as a gift. She had named him Billy. But instead of taking Billy along with her, she gave him to a family in need. 
 
 The singer's latest getaway has come after months of touring. 
 
 In December, she was seen performing at the Z Festival in Brazil and the Z100 Jingle Ball in New York. 
 
 Lovato will be back on stage on February 3 at Dubai's Red Fest DXB festival.
