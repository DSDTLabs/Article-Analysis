HYDERABAD: Taking forward his efforts to form a federal front at the national level,   has roped in state government advisors and bureaucrats to study the socio-economic conditions, best practices, planning and development in countries such as China, Japan and Singapore. Based on these inputs, KCR wants to prepare an agenda for the federal front, which will be put for discussions during his interaction with retired bureaucrats, and employees' organisations. 

 The TRS chief has already started preparations. The state government has about half a dozen bureaucrats as advisors, including former IAS officers Rajiv Sharma, AK Goel, Papa Rao, former DGP   and former IRS officer GR Reddy. Official sources said some serving IAS officers like principal secretary of finance   have been asked to give inputs. Experts will also collect data on agriculture, industries, unemployment, irrigation, power and other important sectors of other countries and compare the country's statistics. 
 
 KCR held a meeting at   on Friday with Rajiv Sharma and Kria (NGO) CEO Balaji Utla, several retired bureaucrats and officers on preparation of a national agenda for development and the viability of the existing methods, both merits and demerits. 
 
 "Though the country became independent seventy years ago, development for the past 70 years has not been on the lines as people expected. Though other countries in the world are racing towards development, we are still not able to fulfil the basic needs. Several states have water disputes that are not being settled. Several reforms suggested by experts on Centre-state relations have not been complied with. The true federal spirit has not been reflected. Under these circumstances, there is a need for preparing an agenda for the national development," KCR said.
