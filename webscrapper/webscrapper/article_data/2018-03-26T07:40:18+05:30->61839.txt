 After seeking help from nagarsheths (sheriffs), Vadilal Sarabhai and Chunilal Chinai, for construction of VS Hospital, Sardar had written to the provincial government for a grant of Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh in April 1927. It was then that Vadilal Sarabhai and Chunilal Chinai contributed for constructing a new hospital and a 21 acre plot was earmarked for it.
 
 When contacted, Dr Sandip Malhan, superintendent of VS Hospital, said that the cancellation of FCRA licence will not make any impact on the functioning of the hospital. “The hospital account was lying dormant for around 10 years and we did not prefer to put proposal for renewing its licence last year, so ultimately its licence got cancelled,” Malhan told TOI.
