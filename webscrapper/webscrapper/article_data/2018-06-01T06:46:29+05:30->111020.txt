PANAJI: Stating that the closure of iron ore   operations had “brought an economic catastrophe” onto Goa, the Congress on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister  , holding the   responsible for the current turmoil in the industry and in the state’s economy.

 Goa Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) president Girish Chodankar, in the letter, said that the BJP-led Goa government was a complete failure in the absence of chief minister Manohar Parrikar.
 
 “It was owing to the acts of the BJP-led government that Goa has been witnessing turmoil as regards to the mining industry and the economy of the state,” Chodankar said in the letter. “The BJP government led by Parrikar is only giving false hope to the people of Goa without providing any relief, despite having central and state governments since the closure of mining seven years back.”
 
 “If mining is not resumed immediately after the monsoon, the economy of Goa will be in a real shambles. We have always been supportive of the over three lakh mining dependents in the state and would always support a correct and appropriate initiative, whether legislative or judicial, within the mandate of the SC order and MMDR Act, in order to ensure that mining dependents get relief and their livelihood is not under duress,” Chodankar said.
 
 Mandrem MLA Dayanand Sopte accused the BJP of ignoring the Congress despite it supporting efforts to restart mining. He told reporters it was shameful for Ayush minister Shripad Naik to ask the Congress for solutions to the mining issue.
 
 “If a minister in the central government and a five-time MP is asking the Congress for a solution to mining, it is a shame for the BJP which is in power at the Centre and in Goa,” Sopte said.
