 I had an arranged marriage and two months ago we moved to a new city because of my job. My wife had to leave her job because of the same. Now, the issue is that ever since we have moved here, she has become too aggressive and also gets   at times, that too at small things. She broke her phone last week, while attempting to hit me with it. Last to last week, she slapped and pushed me the moment I came back from work just because I forgot to get milk. These are some of the instances that I am sharing. I am getting too worried about her changed attitude. We used to have our fights earlier too, but not to this degree, where she'd turn so aggressive. I can never imagine fighting back like this. How should I handle the situation?
 
  
 Surely, this is frustrating and calls for immediate attention. I completely empathise with your situation but would advice you not to retaliate back, as it might exacerbate the situation further. Many times when women leave their job, or move cities, the transitions can cause immense discomfort, and high agitation. There is a high probability that she is harbouring grudges or anger against you, and hence she needs to talk or express about her feelings to someone. The best way would be to involve any close member of her family with whom she shares a good rapport. Allow her to vent out, in your absence. You can also seek professional help, where you both, visit a psychologist and understand where things are going wrong. Some people cannot channelize their anger and frustration and they don't even realise that itâ€™s getting manifested into something so serious. Nonetheless, it can be resolved.
