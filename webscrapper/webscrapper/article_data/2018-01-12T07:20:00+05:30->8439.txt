GURGAON: Forced to marry at 14, molested by father-in-law and brother-in-law,   (name changed), now 16, filed a complaint at Sector 9A police station against her   and the couple who had persuaded her   to get her   in the family. 

 The girl, in her complaint, told cops that two years ago when their neighbour, Seema and Yadram, informed her father about her prospective groom, she was against the idea. As her father was impressed by the groom and his family the marriage was culminated. “Accepting the marriage as my fate, I tried to adjust in my new home. For a few days, things were good, but after a month by father-in-law and brother-in-law started misbehaving with me. Whenever they got an opportunity, they harassed me both physically and mentally. I finally gained courage and moved out of the house last month,” Sunita said in her complaint. 
 
 The police produced her in a city court on Thursday for recording her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC. An FIR was then registered against Seema, Yadram, the girl’s father-in-law and brother-in-law under Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and sections 9 and 10 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 at Sector 9 A police station.
 
 “The girl hasn’t named her husband in her complaint. We have registered the case and are verifying the facts,” said inspector  , SHO, Sector 9A police station.
