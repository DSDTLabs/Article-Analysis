RAJKOT: Body of Dhiru Gujarathi (45), a witness in the sensational rape case of the 50-year-old woman of Mandvi village of Bhavnagar, who allegedly committed suicide 10 days ago was cremated on Tuesday after police lodged an FIR against unknown police officials from   and Bhavnagar police stations for abatement of suicide.

 Family members of Gujarathi had earlier refused to cremate his body alleging that the deceased had committed suicide because of harassment by some cops investigating the rape and murder case. However, after the FIR was lodged against unidentified cops, they performed last rites at his village.
 
 He was an important witness in the crime that had sparked off angry protests by   (Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti) in December last year. Rattled by the protests, the state government had handed over the probe in the case to Bhavnagar Range IG Amit Vishwakarma.
 
 On Monday, PAAS convener  , along with   leaders Siddharth Patel and Amreli MLA Paresh Dhanani had visited Gujarathiâ€™s family members and had convinced them to cremate the body which has been lying in a freezer at his residence since last 10 days. But the ceremony was cancelled at the last moment as police failed to provide them the inquest report along with copy of the FIR against the accused cops.
