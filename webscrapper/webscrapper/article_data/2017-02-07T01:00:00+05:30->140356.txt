Even though   is known for his   regime, not many know that he also has a sweet tooth. The actor, who is particular about what he eats and when, couldn’t resist indulging in ice cream while shooting the romantic number 'Bawra Mann' with   for ' ' in Lucknow.
Given that the film is based in Uttar Pradesh, the real setting naturally became the backdrop of the song. In between shots, an ice cream cart, that was part of the setting, caught Akshay’s attention. Unable to resist the temptation, the actor, suggested that it would add to the scene if Huma and he could be shot eating ice-cream. Director Subhash Kapoor, instantly liked the idea and asked the production team to organise half-a-dozen ice creams for the lead actors.
 By the time the shot was ready, Akki and Huma had gobbled down the dessert, one by one. Well, that’s not all. More flavoured cones were ordered once the camera started rolling. When we quizzed Akshay about his ice cream binge, he admitted, “Well, I have a sweet tooth, but I indulged in it only in the afternoon during the shoot. Since I was working the rest of the day I knew that I would burn those extra calories. You can indulge during the day, but the problem arises when you eat after 7.30 pm because you don’t do much activity to sweat it off.”
