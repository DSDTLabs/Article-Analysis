MUMBAI: Nearly nine months after chief minister   announced the   scheme, it appears that loans worth Rs 25,000 crore of 55 lakh farmers will be waived following   after the   to Mumbai on March 12. This includes loans worth Rs 14,271 crore of around 36.6 lakh farmers that have been waived.

 A high ranking official told TOI that when the CM had declared the loan waiver scheme on June 28 last year, it was proposed to waive loans worth Rs 34,022 crore of 89 lakh farmers. Then it was proposed to make 40 lakh farmers debt-free and waive loans up to Rs 1.5 lakh of 49 lakh farmers.
 
 Subsequently, it was found that there were errors in the data compiled by the state level bankers committee as well as goof up in recording the Aadhaar details. Significantly, initially the CM had stated that the loan waiver exercise will be completed by Dussera. However, there was inordinate delay in waiving the loans. Even today, all the eligible farmers are yet to get the benefit of the loan waiver scheme. “The CM must fix the responsibility for the prolonged delay,’’ he said.
