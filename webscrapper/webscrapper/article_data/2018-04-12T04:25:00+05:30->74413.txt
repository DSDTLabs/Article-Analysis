Vadodara: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) will have to go much beyond its estimate to drill 15 tube wells in different parts of the city to take care of any possible shortage of water this summer. The civic body had taken the decision due to the uncertainty regarding availability of Narmada project water and the depleting water level in Ajwa reservoir.

 The VMC had invited bids on three occasions for the work, but got only one bid on the first and second attempts. The contractor who had bid on the second attempt did not fit in the pre-qualification bid criteria. On the third attempt, three contractors came forward and only one was qualified.
 
 The bid was higher than the VMCâ€™s estimates and after negotiations. The final rate was fixed at a rate of 28.28 per cent higher than the estimates. The administration has now sought a hike of 30 per cent in the amount of Rs 75lakh sanctioned for the project.
