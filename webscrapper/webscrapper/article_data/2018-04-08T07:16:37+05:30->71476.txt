HYDERABAD: Thirty minutes of heavy rain and hailstorm on Friday night was enough to bring the city to its knees as 279 areas plunged into darkness. Officials said the power disruptions were caused by tree branches falling on power lines, cables getting cut and other technical problems.

 
  
  
 
 The mess left behind by the hailstorm was such that the call centre of   State Southern Power Distribution Company Ltd (TSSPDCL) was flooded with calls of power outages and disruptions till late in the night and electricity was restored by midnight.
 
 Officials said power interruptions were reported in 220 areas in Hyderabad metro zone, 32 locations in   east division and 27 in Ranga Reddy north division. In the   limits, falling of trees was reported in Erramanzil, IICT, Nacharam, Jubilee Hills, Banjara Hills, Chilkalguda, Asifnagar, Charlapally, Kushaiguda, NBT Nagar in   and Tolichowki.
 
 Snapping of cables and jumper cut caused power disruption in Amberpet, SD Eye Hospital and   industrial area.
 
 Supply was disrupted in Changicherla, Jubilee Hills, Saketh, Bowenpally, NIMS, Malakpet, Miralam, Santoshnagar, Laxminagar and Kanchanbagh owing to technical issues.
 
 “Our patrolling teams attended to all the complaints and restored power supply within two hours in many areas,” director (operations), TSSPDCL, J Srinivas Reddy told TOI. However, the damages and interruptions were less when compared to last year as trimming of tree branches has been happening since January.
