 is living his Bollywood dream of being an actor. With just a few years into the industry, Sidharth has definitely made his presence felt in the industry. It’s apparent that of late, the ‘Aiyyary’ actor has not been able to hit gold at the box office. Sidharth has although been staying in Bandra, a posh area in Mumbai suburbs. However, as per reports, it’s time for Sidharth to bring in some changes. 

 
 According to a report by a daily, the ‘Baar Baar Dekho’ actor, who is currently residing in Bandra, has been looking into moving out from this place for some time now. Moreover, Sid has already shortlisted one apartment and reportedly, the negotiations for the same is on. And interestingly, the place is quite near to Mukesh and Mahesh Bhatt’s office. 
 
 
 On the work front, Sidharth Malhotra is going through a flat phase because none of his recent films have done great at the box office. However, his upcoming film, which is based Captain Vikram Batra’s life is something that the actor is counting on. And he reportedly will also be seen in Ekta Kapoor’s next titled ‘Shotgun Shaadi’, which will also feature his ‘Ek Villain’ co-star Shraddha Kapoor.
