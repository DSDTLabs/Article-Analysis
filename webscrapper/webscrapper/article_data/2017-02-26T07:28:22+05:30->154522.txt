BELAGAVI: The fight in the Congress party between   president   and   is getting worse by the day.

 Hebbalkar is all set to raise the issue of Satish Jarkiholi’s anti-party strategy in the recent elections for the posts of president and vice-president of the Belagavi Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at the party’s coordination committee meeting in Bengaluru on Sunday. The committee has 11 members including chief minister Siddaramaiah, KPCC president  , ministers D K Shivkumar, K J George, M B Patil, R V Deshpande and Laxmi Hebbalkar. 
 
 “I’ll raise the issue at meeting because such activities sends a wrong message to workers,” Hebbalkar told STOI. She refuted reports about making an official complaint to KPCC, as reported by some sections of the media. 
 
 Jarkiholi had shocked the Congress by playing a crucial role in the APMC elections on February 18, by joining hands with the BJP and Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti (MES) members. MES member   and BJP’s Renuka Patil were elected president and vice-president, defeating official Congress candidates. 
 
 Hebbalkar was worried by the fact that Jarkiholi and BJP’s Belagavi (Rural) MLA Sanjay Patil joined forces in this election. Hebbalkar aspires to be the Belagavi (Rural) constituency candidate in the upcoming assembly elections. She had lost by a small margin in the last elections. 
 
 According to Jarkiholi, there’s no need to give much importance to local bodies elections which are not fight on party lines. However, Hebbalkar took strong objection to the anti-party activites and newspaper advertisements which had pictures of Satish and MES and BJP candidates and leaders after elections. According to Hebbalkar, such activities harm the party.
 
 When asked, district in-charge minister Ramesh Jarkiholi said the high command knows everything. “We don’t need to make a complaint. Top party leaders know about this issue and they’ll take an appropriate decision at the appropriate time,” he said.
