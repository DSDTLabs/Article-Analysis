Mumbai:   has launched a facility under which the company will reimburse   claims of up to Rs 20,000 within two days on the basis of documents uploaded through a mobile application. This will benefit those who are seeking treatment from hospitals which are outside the ‘cashless’ network where bills are directly settled with the insurance company.

 At present, an insured not availing cashless facility or receiving treatment at a non-network hospital, has to share original hardcopies of claim documents with insurance provider to process health reimbursement claims. As a result it takes 8-10 days for the insurance company to process the claim and make the payment to the customer, the company said. “Through this new facility, post-intimating the claim through company’s self-service mobile application —  , the policyholder will have to upload copies of the requisite claim documents on the mobile application,” said Abhijeet Ghosh, health administration head at Bajaj Allianz General Insurance.
 
 “Today, even though insurers provide cashless facility, a considerable chunk of health insurance claims received are reimbursement claims. Currently, it takes 8-10 days to settle a health reimbursement claim due to significant time being spent on movement of documents. By using this facility our customers can instantly register and share claims documents with us allowing immediate assessment and overall reduction in the time taken to process claims,” said Ghosh.
 
 The claims process involves downloading the app from Playstore, entering claim details, and the claimants have to select the policy number under which insured intends to register the claim followed by the name of patient and the hospital. Once the claim is generated, the customer has to scan documents, after marking them as “submitted” to claim from Bajaj Allianz.
