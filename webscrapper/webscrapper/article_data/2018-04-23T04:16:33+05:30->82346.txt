People go to the SC with great trust. He should earn the trust and then start dispensing his work. Till that happens, we feel the CJI should think if he should work as a judge or not. This is an appeal to his conscience.”
 
 Senior lawyers in Rajya Sabha K T S Tulsi, Tankha and Ami Yagnik, and   spokesman  , also attacked the   for making the matter appear a partisan issue. They said no one party needs to defend the CJI. If you do, you are dishonouring him and embarrassing him.
