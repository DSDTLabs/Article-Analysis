COIMBATORE: The counselling for undergraduate agriculture and science and technology courses offered by the   Agricultural University (TNAU), its 14 constituent colleges and 26 affiliated private colleges across the state would go online from this year, said   vice-chancellor K Ramasamy on Monday.

 The online application process will start on May 18 and will go on till June 17. Document verification for special reservations will be held from June 18 to June 20. The rank list will be published on June 22. Counselling for special reservation will be held on July 7, which will be a face-to-face counselling.
 
 The counselling would be held in two phases -- the first phase from July 9 to July 13 and the second phase from July 23 to July 27. Both will be online.
  
 “The university had been receiving applications online for the past four years. From this year, the counselling process would go online. This would make it easy for students from across the state as they will not have to come to Coimbatore to attend TNAU counselling,” Ramasamy said.
 
 TNAU has introduced sliding system in counselling, where a student can opt for a course on the top of his priority list if that falls vacant.
 
 As directed by the Centre, three faculties at the university will be upgraded to colleges. “The faculties of plant molecular biology and biotechnology, sericulture and agri business would be upgraded into colleges from this year,” he said.
 
 There are 3,422 seats for the agriculture, science and technology courses offered by TNAU and constituent and affiliated colleges. Of these, 65% will be filled through the state quota and the rest 35% will be filled by the colleges, from the list of students who apply online on the TNAU portal.
