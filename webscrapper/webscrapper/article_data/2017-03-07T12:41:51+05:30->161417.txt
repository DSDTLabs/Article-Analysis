And the one celebrity we couldn’t keep our eyes off was  . She was there to support her friends Shah Rukh Khan and  . And, even Shah Rukh Khan couldn’t stop himself from ignoring Kajol. While she was simply enjoying, the ramp walk, Shah Rukh Khan stopped midway to her hug her special friend. 

  While Kajol was there to support the show, her look clearly stole the show. She was seen wearing a white sari with sheer blouse by Manish Malhotra. And, her skin was glowing like never, she complemented her look with a bright red lipstick. And when it came to her hairstyle, she brought the vintage charm with the side-swept chignon. 
 
  Looking at Kajol’s look from the show, we can clearly say that she was born for the camera. Here are her stunning photographs from the show:
