MEERUT: Among the top five rankers in his school with 87% marks in Class XII,   gives credit for his success to his 23-year-old elder sister Payal, who took upon herself the responsibility of the family after their father’s demise three years ago. 

 Aman’s father, a tea stall owner in Meerut, died of asthma. It was then that his sister Payal, who had completed her B.Com and was set to pursue M.Com gave up her own dream of becoming a Chartered Accountant and took up a job in a publishing house to support the family and help her siblings complete their education.
 
 “My marks are like a gift to my sister who worked day in and day out to earn a living for the family. The entire family is extremely happy and I hope to crack the competitive exams for engineering and become an engineer one day,” said Aman, a science student at  , Sadar. 
 A resident of Meerut’s Shiv Shakti Nagar, Aman lives with his mother Pushpa and two older sisters Payal and Kajal.
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 Recalling the sudden death of his father, Payal said, “The world had come crashing down that day. He was the only earning member in the family and we didn’t know what to do next. It was then that I joined a publication house in Meerut just 15 days after my father’s death. I completed by M.Com alongside but could not pursue my dream of becoming a chartered accountant because somebody in the family had to earn. I had to ensure that my younger sister and brother finish their studies. Throughout these three years, I have always felt my father to be by my side in the form of the strength I got after he passed away,” said Payal.
 
 Aman’s mother Pushpa Mittal is a housewife while his sister Kajal is a second-year student of M.Sc. in Meerut. 
 
 “My sister is an example to all those who think girls cannot do enough. Had it not been for her, I do not know how I would have been able to complete my schooling,” said Aman.
