NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear during summer vacation in May an appeal filed by 92-year-old former telecom minister   challenging a trial court verdict convicting him in a 22-year-old telecom contract scam.

 Senior advocate  , appearing for nonagenarian Sukhram, told a bench headed by CJI Dipak   that his client does not want to die a tainted man and requested for early hearing of the six-year-old appeal. 
 
 The bench posted the matter for hearing during summer break. The SC had in January 2012 granted bail to Sukhram and other accused while dealing with their appeal against a December 2011 Delhi HC judgement upholding a trial court verdict awarding him three yearsâ€™ in prison.
 
 Sukhram was convicted for awarding a lucrative contract to a private telecom firm for supplying cables to the government at inflated rates after receiving a bribe of Rs 3 lakh in 1996 in abuse of his official position. Then telecom minister had awarded private firm   (HTL) a contract worth Rs 30 crore to supply 3.5 Lakh Conductor Kilometers (LCKM) of Polythene Insulated Jelly Filled (PIJF) cables to the telecom department.
