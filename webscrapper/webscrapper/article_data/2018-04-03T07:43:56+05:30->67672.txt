PANAJI: The state government plans to make a fresh attempt to connect each home in Goa with high-speed  . The IT department is set to take up four constituencies on a pilot basis by May this year, said IT minister Rohan  .

 Given the unreliable   connectivity in the state, the department of information and technology is also looking at revamping the existing  , which is currently operated by United Telecoms Limited (UTL) in collaboration with the state government.
 
 “The vision of this government is to touch up on every household,” Khaunte told TOI. “Like a basic electricity, water, or gas connection, every household will have a broadband connection,” he said.
 
 Khaunte acknowledged that internet penetration in rural Goa is negligible and that reliable internet remains dismally poor in the state, where the government is trying to push tech startups and innovation. To drive the IT ecosystem and enhance learning, Khaunte hopes that high-speed internet will enable children and youth to learn online through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), while adults are able to avail government services without visiting government offices. “Today every house needs connectivity,” Khaunte said. “Even the remotest place needs connectivity.” 
 
 In 2006, then information technology minister,  , signed an agreement with Bangalore-based UTL to connect all villages and households through a broadband network. UTL had to complete the project with broadband connectivity to government offices, educational institutions, panchayats, and households by September 2007, but the scope of the project was changed and the project never moved beyond the panchayat level.
 
 “We are looking at two options; one is continuing the same contract with improvements in infrastructure. The second option is a whole new network which can be put in. We have to contemplate which would be better, faster and economical,” Khaunte said.
