Tirupur: Police arrested eight Nigerians on charges of staying in the city without passports and proper identification cards on Thursday.  Police also warned the locals against renting out houses to Nigerians without cross-checking their documents with the police.  As per records, only four Nigerians have registered with the police to do business in Tirupur. However, more than 200 Nigerians are involved in the trade at Khaderpettai garments market. Earlier, the city police gave them an ultimatum to leave the country. Nevertheless, in the last week of January, they arrested six of them. On Thursday, the Anupparpalayam police arrested six people - Nwankpae Onyeikacg, Nicholas Uchenna Eoozip, Onajite, Nelson O Mbaegbo, Nwonu Okwudihi and Toy Dnyebilchi- at Pichampalayam. Similarly, the North police arrested Stephen and Johnson, who were residing at Rayapuram in Tirupur and Vadavalli in Coimbatore. Police took the help of the Nigerians who know the local language and were staying legally to question the arrested ones. During interrogation, the police learned that the arrested Nigerians neither had proper identification cards nor produced passport or visa, a higher police official said. “Sensing police crackdown, many Nigerians who were staying illegally had vacated from Khaderpettai market and fled from the city. We have intensified the search and warned the local people against giving accommodation to Nigerians without police knowledge,” the official said. The eight Nigerians were booked under sections 3 (2) (C) and 14 of Foreigners Act and were remanded in judicial custody. Since they could not be lodged in Coimbatore central jail, they were sent to Puzhal central jail in Chennai.
