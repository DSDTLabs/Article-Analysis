Bestselling author of 
 and 
 
 , Gillian Flynn is now the writer for the TV show 
 .

 
  is an English TV show that gathered quite a cult following. The show is about the characters who find a manuscript that appears to be the second part of a graphic novel titled 'The Utopia Experiments'. According to legend, the original Utopia Experiments predicted a number of global catastrophes. However, on finding the comic, they fall under the radar of a mysterious group, The Network, and are now hunted by the organisation.
 
 The show lasted two seasons, and despite the following, it didn't get a third season in the UK. A channel tried to bring it to America earlier, with Gillian Flynn as the writer, but couldn't due to budgetary conflicts with the director. Now, it's finally coming back to the small screen with Amazon and Gillian Flynn is still attached to this project.
 
 In a statement published by The Muse, Flynn said: "
 is pure creative catnip to me. Dennis Kelly’s show blew my mind, and he has been so incredibly generous in letting me crack open his world and play around in it and make it my own weird, wild place. Utopia is all about exploring resonant issues within dark, twisted storytelling — it’s a series that’s urgent and current and a little holy-crap!, but a hell of a lot of a fun."
 
 The author is no stranger to the screen, for her book 
  was adapted to a movie and 
  has been adapted to a TV show, releasing this summer.
