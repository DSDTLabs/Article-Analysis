AHMEDABAD: With Gujarat staring at a major water crisis while water levels in Narmada continue at alarmingly low levels, Union minister of state for road transport and highways,   told reporters in the city that the level of water in Narmada depended on natural factors and there was little the government could do about that.   had come to speak at a session on the ‘New India Budget’ organized in Ahmedabad by the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industries (GCCI) and   (IDMA). 

 When asked about concerns over low water levels in Narmada, Mandaviya said, “It is dependent on nature, what can we do about it?”
 
 Speaking about schemes Mandaviya said, “We have come up with   so thatn Narmada water can be channelized through canals and be provided to farmers in north Gujarat for irrigation. Similarly, we launched the Sauni Yojana to provide Narmada water to farmers in Saurashtra.”
 
 He added, “We came up with alternatives in the form of these schemes. Earlier, even this much had not been done.”
 
 Mandaviya pointed out how the recently announced Union budget has made provisions to give minimum support price that is one and a half times the cost of production to help farmers.
 
 Highlighting the importance of focusing on farmers, Mandaviya said, “Social inequality should not increase, else it will give rise to one or the other form of agitation which will cost the society adversely.”
 
 He added, “This is why we are focusing on the poor and middle-class and raising their standard of living as it will take the country on the path of being a developed country. This is why we focused on farmers in the budget.”
