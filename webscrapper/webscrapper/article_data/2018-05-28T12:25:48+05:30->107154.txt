GREATER NOIDA: A group of residents from   society alleged on Saturday that   hired by the developer manhandled them and snatched banners to stop them from organising a car/bike rally from the society to the district collectorate over poor maintenance in the society.

 Residents also alleged that the guards had snatched a mobile phone of a resident when he tried to record the manhandling. 
 
 Later, the residents and the guards filed complaints against each other in Bisrakh police station.
 
 “The developer has been collecting exorbitant maintenance charges. If someone questions them about this, the power supply is disconnected. Six towers have been completed and people have moved in. But, the construction work in the remaining towers is going on and this also creates a problem for the residents,” said  , a resident of Gaur Saundaryam in Tech Zone IV.
 
 Residents had asked the developer to improve the services, but apparently no heed was paid. On Saturday morning, residents were planning to take out a rally when the guards and bouncers arrived there. 
 
 “They snatched our banners and a mobile phone,” Dubey alleged. 
 
 Rakesh Sharma, facility in-charge of society, denied the allegations of manhandling. 
 
 He said residents were carrying misleading and derogatory banners. 
 
 “The guards asked the residents not to protest on campus. The residents started creating a ruckus upon which we had to call the police,” he said. Sharma said some residents are not paying maintenance fee and creating undue pressure. 
 
 He also clarified that one resident’s phone fell on the ground in the ruckus and it was not snatched.
 
 Akhilesh Tripathi, SHO, Bisrak police station said, “The guards have also alleged a resident had ran over his car on a guard’s foot. We’re probing the matter from all angles,” he said.
