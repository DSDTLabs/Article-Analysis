 IGIMS-Patna’s medical superintendent and 1988-batch alumnus Dr Manish Mandal said, “Even after playing cricket for four hours, I am not tired. Of the 40 students from my batch who attended the meet, 10 played and won the match. We even talked about our English teacher Andy Costa and civics teacher Rocky Costa.”
 
 Recalling his school days, Ashutosh told this newspaper, “SMHS was my second home... Now, it is better and bigger, but is missed terribly.”
 
 During the annual general body meeting of the school’s alumni association, secretary   talked about the development works done by the body in one year. He asked the alumni to “help educate underprivileged kids”.
 
 The association secretary also announced names of the new office-bearers.
