CHENNAI: RK Nagar MLA T T V Dhinakaran on Thursday accused speaker   of going back on his promise to give him time to speak in the assembly. 

 Dhinakaran said he sent a plea to the speaker on Wednesday evening, seeking a chance to speak in the assembly on Thursday. The newly elected MLA said he would be unable to attend the assembly session on Friday, when the session ends, as he would be in Bengaluru to meet his aunt   in prison. 
 
 Dhinakaran, who came to the assembly around 11.30am, raised his hand to speak. Soon after DMK MLA P T R Palanivel Thiagarajan finished his speech, the speaker, however, signalled to   ally   to speak. But Dhinakaran stood up and told the speaker, "You said you will allocate time for me." But the speaker said he had only promised to consider his request. 
 
 Even as the argument between speaker and Dhinakaran continued, Ansari began to speak, prompting the independent MLA to ask him to stop. After the speaker refused to give him time saying that on Thursday, only political party leaders would be permitted to speak, Dhinakaran walked out in protest. He told reporters later that the speaker had promised to give him time to speak. 
 
 "On January 8, I asked the speaker to give me a chance to speak and he said he would look into it. But on Wednesday my assistant met him and presented a plea and the speaker told him that I will get a chance during lunch hour," Dhinakaran told reporters. He accused the speaker of not doing his job and being partisan. 
 
 Dhinakaran said he wanted to raise several issues faced by RK Nagar people. "People in my constituency are facing drinking water shortage. They were also promised houses by former chief minister  ," he said.
