 Talking about the inspiration behind the film, Neeraj said in a past interview, “The seeds of 'Aiyaary' were sown during the shoot of 'Baby' (2015), when we were interacting with personnel from the army and intelligence services. The title, 'Aiyaary', has been on my mind for a long time. It’s from the fantasy novel, 'Chandrakanta', written by Devaki Nandan Khatri. The word means ultimate trickery. The title is apt for the story in which a Colonel (Manoj Bajpayee) plays mentor to a Major (Sidharth Malhotra) in the Indian Army. Sidharth looks up to Manoj’s character, but the story reaches a turning point when they have conflicting views about a situation.”
