PATNA: The RJD and state   on Saturday hailed “victory of truth” in  , where BJP’s B S Yeddyurappa resigned as chief minister before facing a crucial trust vote in the assembly.

 “Truth can never be defeated! Truth will always defeat a lie or liar!” leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who will attend the swearing-in ceremony of H D Kumaraswamy on Monday, tweeted soon after Yeddyurappa tendered his resignation. 
 
 Congress said it was an inevitable outcome as Yeddyurappa did not have required number to pass the test. “That the B S Yeddyurappa government would fall even before facing the confidence vote had become quite obvious, but the real pride of place must go to the Supreme Court because its constant vigil and strict instructions helped in preventing the murder of democracy in the country by the BJP,” Bihar Congress acting president Kaukab Quadri said.
 
 State BJP president Nityanand Rai, on the other hand, said Yeddyurappa made a dignified speech in the House before tendering his resignation. “It had the echo of the exemplary performance of the then PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee on the floor of the Lok Sabha in 1996,” Rai said, adding the BJP was committed to upholding democracy.
