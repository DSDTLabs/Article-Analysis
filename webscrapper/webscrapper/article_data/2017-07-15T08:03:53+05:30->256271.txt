 Police said the accused appeared to be an acquaintance of the victim,  , as the entry to the house was “friendly”. She lived in a flat on the first floor of a building located in lane number six of Lalita Park. 
 
 Her in-laws lived on the ground floor while her brother-in-law, Ashwini, lived on the second floor. Bansal’s husband had died a year ago due to some ailment, police said. She has two daughters who are married and live separately.
 
 She works as the caretaker of a women’s PG in her neighbourhood. Around 10pm on Thursday, Bansal’s sister-in-law allegedly saw two men locking the house from outside and leaving. Thinking that Bansal would be downstairs, she went to check. Later, she came upstairs and alerted her husband. They found her lying in a pool of blood. Police were informed and the crime scene was inspected by a forensic team. Cops have found no ransacking in the house and hence, are not treating robbery as their first line of probe. 
 
 Initial investigations have revealed that Bansal’s huaband, Anil, was a financier and some people owed him money. Cops are probing if a dispute over payments led to the murder. The family has, however, not informed cops of any such dispute.
 
 Police found two glasses of water on the table. This indicates that the killer must be known to her, they said. The fingerprints lifted from these glasses are being analysed. 
 
 A neighbour has told cops that the woman had bought some snacks from her shop around 9.30pm. Police are trying to ascertain if she was expecting some guests.   footage from the locality and the victim’s call records are being scanned for clues. An FIR has been registered and three teams formed to crack the murder, cops said.
