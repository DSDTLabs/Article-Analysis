KLHAPUR:   (SSS), a farmers’ outfit of the MP   displayed black flags before the chief minister   at Sangli.

 The CM had arrived for the inauguration ceremony of a new building of the district administration on Friday afternoon. The CM was accompanying another leader of the outfit Sadabhau Khot, who was earlier a member of the SSS’s political wing — Swabhimani Paksha. He is now a minister in the state cabinet.
 
 The black flags were shown to protest the state’s apathy in waiving off farmers’ loans, a promise made by Fadnavis before he came to power.
 
 Two days ago, local leaders of the outfit had announced that they would block the CM’s vehicle and question him about the forgotten promise. Owing to this threat, the police department deployed a heavy security force along the CM’s route.
 
 SSS district vice-president,  , said, “Prior to the election, the BJP had promised to waive off loans to the farmers and pay them a good price for their produce. The people voted for the BJP in large numbers, but now they seem to have forgotten their promises. We are protesting against the government to free farmers from any debt as this is leading to farmers’ suicides.” 
 
 At present, the SSS is on the verge of a split owing to the differences between Khot and Shetti. Workers claimed that Khot is unable to address the farmers’ concerns despite being the minister. 
 
 While speaking at Miraj, Fadnavis said the government has decided to run the irrigation projects on solar power. “The decision has been taken to free farmers from the electricity bills. The survey for undertaking the task will start soon,” he said.
