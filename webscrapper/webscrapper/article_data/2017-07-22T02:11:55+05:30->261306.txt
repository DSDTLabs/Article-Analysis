NEW DELHI: Pulling up Delhi Police for its “lethargy” and failure to reach a “definitive conclusion” about the cause of   Pushkar’s death, a court on Friday ordered de-sealing of suite number 345 of Hotel Leela, where her body was found. 

 “The hotel cannot be put to unending hardship and loss due to lethargy on the part of the investigating team,” observed metropolitan magistrate  . The court said that the hotel room must be de-sealed within four weeks. 
 
 It further said that no reasonable ground had been put forth by the police for keeping the suite locked for more time. “In the name of investigation, the suite of Hotel Leela cannot be locked forever,” the magistrate said.
 
 Police seemed unsure when the court enquired if they required the room for further investigation. The court said there was no definitive conclusion in police’s status report regarding the cause of Pushkar’s death.
 
 “It goes without saying that if the investigating agency is unable to conclude probe by this time due to some exceptional circu-mstances warranting more time, it may approach the court by way of appropriate application for further extension of time with an advance notice to Hotel Leela,” the court said.
 
 The hotel on Friday submitted that insects and bugs had infested the locked room and it is willing to transfer the materials inside it to another room so that the investigation was not hampered. It further said that the room had been lying locked since January 17, 2014 and no police team had inspected it for over a year. Huge financial loss is being incurred by the hotel, it submitted. An FIR was registered by Delhi Police on January 1, 2015 against unknown persons under IPC section 302 (murder). 
 
 Sunanda Pushkar, wife of Congress MP  , was found dead under mysterious circumstances in the hotel on January 17, 2014.
