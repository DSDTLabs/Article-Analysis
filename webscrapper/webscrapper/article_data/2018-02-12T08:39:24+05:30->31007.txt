QUEPEM: The local assistant transport director’s office catering to Sanguem and Quepem talukas has been operating without an official vehicle of its own for the past four months. The situation which has come to the fore during the 8th State Road Safety Week has routinely been hampering work and forcing officials to use their private vehicles for official purposes.

 The department currently owns just a rusty jeep that was officially declared unfit and is parked inside the government building’s premises. Assistant transport director   confirmed that the old vehicle has been condemned four months back. “I have informed the director of transport regarding the situation,” he said.
 
 Without a vehicle, officials find it difficult to issue challans for traffic violators, conduct inspections, checking processes and attend to complaints, sources said.
 
 Meanwhile, the Quepem transport department office is observing State Road Safety Week in full swing, with awareness programmes and lectures having been delivered at four higher secondary schools from Quepem and Sanguem talukas—Pope John (Quepem), Guardian Angel (Curchorem),   (Curchorem) and Government College, Sanguem. RTO officials spoke to the youth about ensuring safety while driving and said around 180 youths in the 18-25 age group die every year in road accidents.
 
 The department also conducted a medical camp at the Quepem primary health centre where Dr  , an ophthalmic surgeon from GMC, conducted free check-up.
