PANCHKULA: Senior vice-chairperson of   Sacha Sauda management trust and member of sect's executive committee, P R Nain has admitted to burial of bones beneath the greenbelt in a portion of dera headquarters in Sirsa. However, in his interrogation by Sirsa special investigation team (SIT) headed by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Kuldeep Singh Beniwal, he has clarified that the bones were part of the ashes of the dera followers' kin which were scattered in the Sirsa headquarters after cremation at their respective native places.

 According to sources, same questions were put before dera trust chairperson Vipassana Insan, who also revealed the same information as given by Nain. The SIT has started quizzing members of dera's executive committee and management.
 
 Nain told the SIT that the sect followers believed that that they would attain salvation after their bones were buried in the dera complex. He added that the dera had run a drive to make followers bury the bones or ashes of their dead on the dera premises instead of immersing them in rivers and causing pollution.
 
 Sources added that Nain also provided SIT with records of 350 persons whose bones were buried in the dera complex. Sirsa police have started verification about burial of the dead on the basis of the details provided by the dera management.
 
 Nain, a key member of the dera, was heading the horticulture and agriculture projects run by the management. SIT had also questioned Nain about Honeypreet, dera spokesperson   and their role in violence that broke out in Sirsa when the special CBI court in Panchkula had convicted Gurmeet Singh for rape on August 25.
 
 Referring to Honeypreet, Nain said he had come to know about her return to Sirsa only after she had left the town. He added that he did not have any contact with Aditya. Nain also denied having a role in the violence in Sirsa and alleged it was an act of anti-social elements.
