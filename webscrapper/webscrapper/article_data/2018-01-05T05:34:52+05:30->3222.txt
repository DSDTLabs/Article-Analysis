MUMBAI: Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar on Thursday claimed that chief minister   has assured that the proposed commission of inquiry looking into the Koregaon Bhima clash will be given powers to award sentences to the culprits. However, Fadnavis was noncommittal on the same. 

 Fadnavis had on Tuesday ordered a judicial probe into the Koregaon Bhima episode. Notwithstanding Ambedkar's claim, as per the provisions of the Commission of Inquiry Act, while the panel has limited powers under the Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code, it has no powers to award sentences to the culprits. "The commission has powers to recommend, but the recommendations can not be enforced. It is for the government to take a decision on the recommendations. In the past, it was found that the entire report of the commission was rejected by the state government," a senior bureaucrat said.
 
  
  
 
 Fadnavis confirmed to TOI that a delegation led by Ambedkar did met him and submitted a memorandum demanding arrest of certain leaders. "We have taken note of their demand. My view is that the law will take its own course," Fadnavis, who has assured that a sitting   judge will head the commission, said. 
 
 Dalit leaders had warned of violent protests if the perpetrators behind the Koregaon Bhima episode were not punished. " Fadnavis has agreed to grant powers under the Criminal Procedure Code to the commission, as a result, its recommendations will be binding on the government," said Ambedkar.
 
 Ambedkar demanded the arrest of Shiv Pratisthan leader Sambhaji Bhide and Hindu Ekta Parishad president Milind Ekbote for instigating the rioters. He also wants the state to halt combing operations against Dalit activists across the state.
 
 A BJP minister has said that there was no question of arresting Bhide since he was not directly involved in the Bhima-Koregaon episode. "As for Ekbote, police will probe charges and then decide on the course of action," he added.
