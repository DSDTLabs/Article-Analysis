NEW DELHI: The issue of attack on African students in Greater Noida was raised in   on Thursday, with external affairs minister   informing the House that she had spoken to Uttar Pradesh chief minister   who had assured an “impartial probe” in the matter.

 The matter was raised by JDU member Sharad Yadav who said such racial attacks in India cannot be tolerated just as public opinion is hurt when Indians are attacked in United States or elsewhere. Even deputy chairman PJ Kurien condemned the attack on African students, asking the government to take “very strict action”.
 
 “We are condemning racial attacks on Indians in US and Australia, and at the same time racial attacks in our country cannot be justified. The government should be very vigilant and very strong action should be taken,” Kurien said.
 
 Swaraj said “it won’t be proper to say anything unless investigation is over”. “Both incidents are unfortunate.
 
 Firstly, a 19 year-old boy died, and thereafter, there was an attack on a Nigerian student. ...On behalf of Uttar Pradesh CM and myself, I want to assure that there will impartial probe,” she said. She said that state administration was taking steps to maintain law and order and that the Nigerian student is being treated in a hospital.
 
 Congress member Anand Sharma said India commands goodwill and its image is being sullied throughout the world with this incident. He demanded a special cell in external affairs and home ministries to protect such students.
