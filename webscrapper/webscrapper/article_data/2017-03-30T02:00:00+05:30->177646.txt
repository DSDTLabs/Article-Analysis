PATNA: The state government is all set to submit the proposals to the Centre on Thursday for the   contest. The proposal of Patna, which is based on decongestion theme, would cost Rs2,498 crore for its execution.

 Apart from Patna, Muzaffarpur and Biharsharif also presented their proposals in a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary   on Wednesday. Their proposals would also be sent to the Centre.
 
 “The chief secretary has given nod and the proposals would now be sent to the Union urban development department, which will select the best proposals from across the country,” said a   ( ) official, adding, “The Patna proposal has been designed while keeping in mind the heritage value and future expansion of the city.”
 
 Another official said though all the areas, including the riverfront, Patna Junction, slum areas, Gandhi Maidan besides residential and commercial places have been considered for development, the main focus is on easing traffic congestion in the city.
 
 If Patna wins the contest, it would get Rs200 crore from the Centre and the state government for five years, making the total of Rs1,000 crore. Since the cost of plan execution is more than the grant the city would get, the PMC would carry rest of the development works on   mode and through the ongoing central and state schemes, the official said. 
 
 It is to be noted that Patna and 13 other cities, which were not among the selected 98 cities, were given wild card entries to plead their cases. “It is mandatory to score 55 marks out of 100 to get selected. The marks are given on the parameters set by the selection committee,” said the PMC official.
