 actress   Pinkett   opened up about her struggle with hair loss. "It was terrifying when it first started. I was in the shower one day and had just handfuls of hair in my hands and I was just like, 'Oh my god, am I going bald? It was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking in fear. That's why I cut my hair, and why I continue to cut it," she said.

  
  
  Jada said doctors and specialists have not been able to diagnose what's causing the hair loss, but she adds ... her friends think it's stress. "The higher power takes so much from people... and, by golly, if the higher power wants to take your hair. That's it" she said on a positive note.
 
    also used the occasion to dwell upon on how she likes the way she looks with a hair wrap. "When my hair is wrapped I feel like a queen. I love having a wrapped head," Jada added.
