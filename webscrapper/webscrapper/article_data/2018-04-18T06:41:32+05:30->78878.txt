KOLKATA: A day after a young   resident chased down her molester and got him arrested, several women in the township on Tuesday came forward to share their apprehensions while venturing out on the roads.

 Manjarini Mallik, a student of   for Basic Sciences in Salt Lake’s JD Block, said, “I am scared of walking on Salt Lake roads, especially in the evening. Often men pass comments and make indecent gestures.”
 
 Manjarini’s fear was echoed by another Salt Lake resident, Payel Chandra, who shifted from her AG-block home to her other house in Beliaghata. “My son studies in a school at CL block in Salt Lake, but I have left my home near Karunamoyee bus stand. This township is unsafe, especially in the evening. I have often been stalked and teased while walking deserted alleys in the afternoon and evenings. I don’t feel very safe living here,” she said.
 
 Some other places in the township, including the areas around Baisakhi footbridge, behind Bidhannagar subdivisional hospital, the road between City Centre and the  , CK and CL blocks and the lanes and alleys opposite Bidhannagar College, are not safe, said the residents.
 
 The streetlights around Salt Lake stadium got an upgrade during the Under-17 Fifa World Cup. The main roads were lit brightly, but the alleys and interiors remain dark.
 
 A senior officer of  , however, refuted the claims. “There has been no major rise in the rate of crime related to women safety in the township. Sporadic incidents may happen, but that cannot be treated as a trend. We implement every possible measure for safety of women,” he said.
