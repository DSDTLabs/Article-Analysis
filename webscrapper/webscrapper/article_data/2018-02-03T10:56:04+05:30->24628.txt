BATHINDA: A thirty five-year-old woman of   village in   district has accused Kotbhai police Station House Officer (SHO)   of keeping her in illegal confinement and also, of beating her up.

 The victim Binder Kaur alleged that her brother residing in Chhateana village had lured a girl and took her away. Going by his misdeeds, the family had disowned him a few months ago.
 
 However, the SHO on Friday, took her to police station and kept her in illegal confinement. She said despite telling him that the family has nothing to do with her brother, who has already been disowned, the SHO kept on inquiring about his whereabouts and also thrashed her in the police station. She was only let off when her family members called up and informed the   about the incident.
 
 Her husband Baltej Singh said the SHO has threatened us not to complain to anyone.
 
 However, SHO Krishan Kumar denied the charges and termed these as false allegations.
 
 Earlier last month, Krishan had a tiff with   (SAD) leader   on the issue of detaining a SAD activist.
 
  DSP  , when contacted, said, “I have just reached the police station to inquire the matter. The woman will be called to record her statement and matter will be thoroughly probed. If the allegations are found to be true, strict action will be recommended against the SHO.”
