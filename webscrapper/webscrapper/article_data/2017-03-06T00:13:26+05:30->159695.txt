Gurgaon: Expediting the rehabilitation of Dwarka expressway oustees, Huda has begun demarcating Sector 110A. 

 Oustees from New Palam Vihar are likely to get possession of alternative plots in the next few days and will be given six months to vacate the structures coming in the alignment of the road, paving way for completion of the remaining portion of Dwarka expresssway.
 
 “We have cleared the land in sector 110A and begun demarcating it. In the coming days, we will start alloting these plots to the oustees who have received the allotment letters,” said Huda administrator Yashpal Yadav.
 
 Huda has already given physical possession of alternative plots to oustees of Dwarka Expressway from Khedki Daula in Sector 37-C. Of the 18-km Dwarka expressway being constructed by Huda, around 14.5km of the road has already been built. The remaining portion — New Palam Vihar and Kherki Daula – was stuck due to delay in rehabilitation of the oustees.
 
 The proposed 150m wide Dwarka expressway was envisaged 10 years ago. The project which was to be ready before Commonwealth Games 2010 has already missed six deadlines.
 
 Yadav said Huda will complete developmental work in sectors 37C and 110A in four months, much ahead of the six-month deadline to the oustees.
 
 With this Huda will complete rehabilitation of all eligible oustees, except those with general power of attorney (GPA) and special power of attorney (SPA).
