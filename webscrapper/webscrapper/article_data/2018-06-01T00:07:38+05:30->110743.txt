Kochi: The high court has, for the second time. declined bail to the priest accused of raping a minor girl though over a year has passed since the alleged incident took place.

 Justice Sunil Thomas declined bail to main accused father Robin alias Mathew Vadakkencheril, who was the vicar of Neendunokki parish at Kottiyoor under Mananthavadi diocese of Syro Malabar Church. According to the prosecution, the priest had raped the 16 year old when she arrived at church premises to attend computer classes.
 
 The court directed that the investigation team should file the chargesheet within 40 days after completing the probe and the trial in the case should be completed within six months.
 
 In the bail plea, the priest contended that he has been in jail since February last year and trial proceedings have not started yet. In these circumstances, he should be granted bail (by imposing strict conditions, if required), it was said.
 
 Senior public prosecutor Suman Chakravarthy, strongly opposing the bail plea, argued that there was high chance of the accused influencing the rape survivor and her family as they belong to the same denomination of the church. “This is a case where the survivor had initially implicated her father to save the priest. Finally, the baby delivered by the survivor was subjected to DNA test to nail the priest. Therefore, if bail is granted, there is every chance that the accused would influence the girl and her family and it would affect a successful trial,” the prosecution submitted. The court was also informed by the prosecution that the priest was nabbed by police while he was trying to flee to Canada
 
 “The accused would flee from the clutches of law. Therefore, bail should not be granted in the case as the accused is not only influential but may also try to escape a trial,” the prosecution submitted adding that long period of detention was not a ground to grant bail.
