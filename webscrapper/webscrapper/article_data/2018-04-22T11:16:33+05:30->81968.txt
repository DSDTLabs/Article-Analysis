The signs were already there at the DI show last December. But this Thursday proved that Mel and the boys have come some distance since then. As the guitar strings bent and shimmered, the harmonica wailed, Saul’s booming voice — three parts Memphis, one part Chicago — soared and pulsed, you knew it was a blues night alright. Anyway, you couldn’t possibly miss the ladies dancing. And the barmen too.

  
 For the Thursday Jazz Encounter gig at Phoenix, Astor Hotel, marked a return to full-throated, feet-stomping blues and blues rock at the hands of four most unlikely musicians — two schoolteachers, a marketing man and a just-out-of-college chap. Two of them also happen to be father and son. The music the   Blues Band played through the evening traversed families though. There was BB King for good measure — The thrill is gone, Every day I have the blues — a dash of  , some Rolling Stones, Hendrix and quite at the end, an unexpected foray into Bob Marley.
  
  
 The evening threw up many such anecdotes, but what needs to be talked about is the band’s music, which swept up in waves of beauty and took the audience with it. Father and son, backed up solidly by   on the bass guitar and   on the drums, showed that if there’s good music playing, there’s always an audience for it.
 Oh yes, at the risk of perpetuating a stereotype, it has to be mentioned that all the four musicians are Anglo-Indians, that melodic community which gave you Park Street music that everyone keeps raving about long after it’s dead. But as Mel and his gang played into the night, just a few blocks away from Park Street, the thrill, indeed, was not gone.
 There’s still hope for our Calcutta. Lord have mercy.
