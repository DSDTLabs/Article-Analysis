GURUGRAM: Minister of state and Gurugram MP   called on railways minister   in   on Tuesday and pressed for modernisation of Gurugram  . Singh also demanded that nearby stations at Basai, Dhankot and Garhi Harsaru be developed into bigger facilities, in keeping with the requirements of this rapidly growing city.

 “Lakhs of people from across the country live and work in Gurugram. I met the railways minister and urged him to take steps to upgrade the existing railway station in Gurugram on a par with those located in other cities. The railways minister assured me of action, and has directed his officials to look into this matter. I have also requested him to speed up the electrification work on Delhi-Rewari section,” Singh said.
 
 “There is not much land available at the existing Gurugram station for its expansion. Hence, I have requested him (Goyal) to look at the alternate places nearby, such as Basai, Dhankot and Garhi Harsaru, where space is available for expansion,” the Gurugram MP added.
 
 Also, Singh claimed to have reiterated the long-pending demand for linking Mewat with the railway network. As of now, Mewat, which figured in the list of 115 most backward districts in the country as per a recent NITI Aayog report, does not have any rail connectivity.
