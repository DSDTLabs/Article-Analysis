Panaji: Directorate of panchayats (DoP) had asked panchayat bodies in the state to hold  , which were scheduled in January and stalled due to assembly elections, but a delay in convening the meetings as required has irked members in various villages.

 Many panchayats promptly convened the gram sabhas after DoP issued a circular, requesting the panchayats to hold the meetings, as per the rules, but a sizeable chunk of them have not shown interest in fulfilling the requirement, sources said.
 
 “We have already issued a circular to the panchayats. They have to hold the gram sabhas to pass the budget. We will initiate action if they fail to do so,” director, DoP, G P Pilarnekar said.
 
 The gram sabha members of Chimbel panchayat have petitioned the block development officer (BDO), Tiswadi, alleging that the local panchayat body is delaying the holding of the January meeting. 
 
 “Many illegal constructions, land conversions, deforestation and other illegalities have occurred in Chimbel. Complaints had been filed before the panchayat as well as with police,” a member of Chimbel Manch, a NGO said.
 
 Chandrakant Kunkolkar, deputy sarpanch, Chimbel denied the charges, stating that it happened before his term and assured that the gram sabha will be held shortly. 
 
 The members are apprehensive as the term of panchayats is ending. “In Merces, the meetings have not been held as per the requirement, as the panchayat authorities want to avoid queries and criticism from villagers,” a villager said.
