SALIGAO: Work on widening the narrow road leading to   beach in Nerul, Bardez, commenced on Monday.

 Minister for   and   MLA Jayesh   inaugurated the works of building a one-and-half meter retaining wall and also widening the narrow stretch. Last year, TOI had reported about the narrow road access which was putting commuters, especially two-wheeler riders at risk. This narrow road witnesses a lot of traffic during peak tourist season making it difficult for four wheelers including tourist buses to access the beach area. 
 
 Tourists and locals traveling on two wheelers, have to also ride precariously on this narrow stretch in order to allow a bus or a car to pass by.
 
 “We have obtained permission from farmers and the comunidade of Nerul,” Salgaonkar said. He added that members of the boat owners association have collected some funds to provide relief to farmers who have sacrificed part of their fields for the work.
