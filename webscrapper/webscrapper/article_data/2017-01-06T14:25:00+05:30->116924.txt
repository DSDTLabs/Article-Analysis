MUMBAI: A day after   chief Uddhav Thackeray criticized the Centre’s plan to unveil the Budget on February, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis skipped an inauguration event organized by the transport and environment departments, which are controlled by the Sena. 

 The invitation cards sent out for the event mentioned both Thackeray and Fadnavis as the chief guests for the event at which a new taxi scheme for rural Maharashtra was announced and air purifying units were installed.
 
 The event that was supposed to begin at 10.30am, began only at 12.30pm after Uddhav arrived at the venue. In a party meeting on Wednesday at Rang Sharda, Uddhav had criticized the   government calling it autocratic and also hinted that he would like to contest solo in the upcoming civic elections. 
 
 Officials from the CM’s office said that Fadnavis had already intimated the department that he wouldn’t be able to attend the function as he was visiting Aurangabad and Nagpur for different events. “Even if the CM is not in the city, it has been decided by both the parties to include the names of both leaders for such functions,” said an official. There has been a cold war brewing between the leaders of both these two parties for a while now and with the civic elections approaching, the friction will only increase.
 
 Maharashtra transport minister Diwakar Raote announced that the department would launching the ‘bhagwa–aboli’ coloured autos that will be driven by women at a function in Thane on Friday. “This is an initiative which will empower women from the weaker sections of the society,” said Raote.
 
 As many as 548 women from across the state, including 314 from the Mumbai region, had bagged auto permits through a lottery process.
