Shimla: A team of the Union ministry of civil aviation would arrive in the state on a two-day visit on May 7 to inspect sites for the proposed international airport in Mandi.

 The team would inspect three locations — Ner Dangu in Balh sub-division, Gogardhar in Paddhar sub-division and Moviseri in Gohar sub-division.
 
 On April 23, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur had raised the airport issue in Mandi district with Union civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu in New Delhi.
 
 Sources said adequate land is already available to set up an airport at all the proposed sites. Now only technical specifications are needed to be looked into to confirm whether an airport could be constructed at these sites.
 
 Power minister Anil Sharma on Monday had directed the officials to include two sites — Basadhar and Nandgarh — for the proposed project. He had asked the officials to complete the required formalities before the arrival of central team so that the visiting team could be taken to these sites too for an inspection.
 
 Himachal Pradesh presently has three airports at Shimla, Bhuntar and Gaggal, but these could not be expanded to meet the requirement of international airport due to the unavailability of required land and state-of-the-art technology.
 
 A profile study done by the research bureau of PHD Chamber on Himachal Pradesh in 2012 had said there was a need to set up an international airport in the state, which is capable of handling larger aircraft, to facilitate international tourists from Europe and South East Asia.
 
 “Improving air connectivity within the state and rest of the country needs to be taken up on a priority, not only for attracting tourists but also for attracting investments from sunrise sectors like information technology and biotechnology,” the study had said.
