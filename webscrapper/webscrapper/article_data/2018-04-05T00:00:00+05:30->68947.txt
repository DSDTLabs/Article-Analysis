Over the years, the 2013 black comedy Moodar Koodam, directed by Naveen, has managed to generate a fan following, even though it did not do well at the box office at its time of release despite being warmly received by the critics. Now, we hear that   is making another film in the same genre and has titled it   2. 

 US-based Sumathi, who was part of the first film, has now acted in this film as well. Says the actress, “I had come here for vacation when I got the opportunity to be part of Moodar Koodam. When Naveen informed me he was making his next, I wanted to act in it as well and came to India. This film is not a sequel, but has a different story. However, the team is more or less the same.”
 
 She reveals that the film is set against a gangster backdrop. “Everyone is a gangster in this film. But they are gangsters in a black comedy,” she informs, but refuses to disclose any further details. “Even though the film is in the post-production phase, and I have finished dubbing for my role, the director hasn’t made it official yet, so it wouldn’t be right to talk about the film in detail,” she apologises. 
 
 The actress says that she has received two offers, but is yet to take them up. While shooting for Naveen’s film, she says that she had also met with Pa Ranjith. “He is my favourite director and I told him that I’d love to act in his film. But, by then, he had finished the shoot of Kaala. I hope I get a chance to work with him in the future,” she signs off.
