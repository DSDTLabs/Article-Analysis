Vadodara: Vadodara’s in-charge district education officer (DEO) has decided to send an officer to two schools on Wednesday after receiving a representation from parents’ body against leaving certificates they issued to students over non-payment of pending fees by their parents. 

 On Tuesday, members of the Vadodara Parents Association (VPA) had approached in-charge DEO M N Patel complaining against two city-based schools including Navrachana School, Sama and Shannen School. VPA claims that the schools have issued leaving certificates to seven students. 
 
 “While there are five students who have been issued leaving certificates by Navrachana School, Sama, there are two wards of a single parent who have been issued leaving certificates by Shannen School,” said Kishore Pillai, VPA’s spokesperson .
 
 “The in-charge DEO has assured us that he will seek an explanation from the school authorities. Based on the response we get on Wednesday, we will make further representation before the Vadodara district collector against the schools,” he said, adding that the parents have sought the education department’s intervention to get the kids re-instated in the schools. 
 
 “We have received the representation and we will send an officer to know from the schools why the leaving certificates have been issued by them,” Patel told TOI.
