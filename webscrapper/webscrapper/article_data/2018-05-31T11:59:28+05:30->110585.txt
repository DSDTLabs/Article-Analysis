MEERUT: In a fresh twist to the alleged   ‘love jihad’ case, the woman, who had eloped with a local history-sheeter named   and later resurfaced claiming that she was willingly living with him, was on Wednesday arrested and jailed after her brother told police that he had seen her with his assailants.

 
 
  
  The woman was married to another man from Muzaffarnagar on April 2. While returning to her husband’s house on April 8, she was allegedly abducted by a group of car-borne assailants. On May 17, her brother filed an FIR at Bhawanpur police station claiming that he was shot at by a group of men while returning home. The complainant had named Shahzad as the main accused.
  
  On May 26, the woman gave her statement in court saying that she had willingly eloped with Shahzad and that she wasn’t abducted. Two days later on May 28, her brother submitted an affidavit to police claiming that his sister was in the car with Shahzad and his associates when he was shot.
  
  According to station officer of Bhawanpur police station, Ashutosh Kumar, “On May 17, the woman’s brother was shot and on April 28, two days after she refuted charges of abduction against her lover filed by her family, he gave an affidavit stating that his sister was present at the time of the attack. So we booked her under   section 307 (attempt to murder) and arrested her.”
  
  After the couple eloped, several Hindu groups cried ‘love jihad’ and blamed the local police and administration for not acting against the accused.
  
  Officials said that Shahzad, a resident of Parikshitgarh, has more than half-a-dozen cases of attempt to murder, loot and robbery against him at various police stations. Currently out on bail, he is also accused of robbing a Bareilly jeweller of Rs 1 crore in 2015.
