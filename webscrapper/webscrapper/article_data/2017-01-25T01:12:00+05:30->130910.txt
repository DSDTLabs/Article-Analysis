MUMBAI: While politicians of various hues are making a beeline for the saffron camp,   leader   on Tuesday joined the NCP in the presence of its state chief Sunil Tatkare. 

 Gawande, a former minister of state, had declared his plan to join NCP during the state legislature’s winter session. A firebrand leader, Gawande was instrumental in Shiv Sena’s growth in Akola and surrounding districts.
 
  Gawande was first elected to the legislative assembly from Karanja constituency in 1991 and re-elected in 1995, however, he lost in 1999, but was re-elected in 2004. Tatkare appointed Gawande as the party’s vice-president. “Gawande will be an asset to our organization,” Tatkare said.
 
 After the 2009 and 2014 elections, Gawande was completely sidelined by Shiv Sena. Gawande’s decision to quit Shiv Sena assumes political significance, as from the time he made it clear that he was leaving the party, many outfits were trying to rope him in due to his organisational skills.
