KOLKATA: A 73-year-old man and his 17-year-old grandson with learning disability were found dead at their   residence on Friday afternoon. Though police are yet to ascertain the cause of deaths, they suspect that the elderly man laced milk with poison and fed his grandson before killing himself the same way.

 The septuagenarian’s wife  , who works as an ayah, found her husband   and their only grandson   lying dead in a room after returning home from her job. According to locals, Aridip, who had difficulty in talking and walking, used to live with his grandparents in the rented accommodation while his father Arindam, a small-time trader, lives in another house with wife  .
 
 “The septuagenarian had fallen ill and was almost bedridden for over six months. The elderly couple was having a tough time looking after Aridip,” a local woman said.
 
 “We have initiated two separate unnatural death cases. We are waiting for the autopsy report to know the exact cause behind their deaths,” a senior district police officer said.
