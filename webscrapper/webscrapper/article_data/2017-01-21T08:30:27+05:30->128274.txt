KOCHI: A mini-lorry rammed into a tanker truck carrying   sparking panic among passers-by in Kalamassery here on Friday morning as the fuming liquid rushed out from the tank. Five units of the fire force rushed to the spot to avoid untoward incidents. 

 The incident happened along the HMT Road near a weigh bridge facility at Pottakuzhy. The tanker, carrying about 13 tonnes of liquid nitrogen to Ambalamugal Bharath Petroleum Corporation Ltd was parked to be weighed when the collision happened. 
 
 According to preliminary estimates about 1.5 tonne nitrogen was leaked in the collision. The fire tenders were able to seal the tanker within 45 minutes. "Liquid nitrogen is flammable only if sufficient heat is applied. However, upon exposure to atmosphere the liquid nitrogen will get converted into high volumes of nitrogen gas creating a deficiency of oxygen in the area," said a fire official. "The tanker was pumped with water to lower the density of nitrogen. Later, the tanker was sealed. None of the fire officials or passers-by suffered any health problems," said the official. A huge vapour cloud was however formed in the area, raising concerns of cold burns. An FIR of fire occurrence has been lodged at  .
