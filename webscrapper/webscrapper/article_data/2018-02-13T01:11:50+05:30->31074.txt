VADODARA: On  , a group of Barodians will take a unique initiative to not just save but also work for revival of the Vishwamitri River. 

 Members of the   group will gather on the ghaats of the river near   and take an oath to protect the river. They will also paint and decorate the ghaat which has been lying neglected for years. 
 
 “The river is important for its rich biodiversity and for maintaining the underground water table. The authorities, though, have ignored this river and even tried to damage its biodiversity. So we decided to take this initiative to spread awareness among citizens,” said Dr  , a group member 
 
 
 
 
 
 “We will take an oath to protect the river amid chants of Lord Shiva on Tuesday,” said  , another member of the group. 
 
 On Sunday, the group picked up the garbage lying on this ghaat. The ghaat has a temple of Lord Shiva apart from some unique heritage.
