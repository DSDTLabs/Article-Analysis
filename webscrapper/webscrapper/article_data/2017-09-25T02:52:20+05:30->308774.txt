NEW DELHI: Tourism ministry’s ‘Incredible India’ campaign received a fillip on Sunday with   Narendra   — in his ‘Mann Ki Baat’ radio address — asking people to take pride in India’s   and tour its farthest corners.

 “We should feel India’s diversity, touch it, feel its fragrance... Diwali is drawing near, all around in our country, there is an inclination to travel,” he said. Citing leaders like Gandhi, Lokmanya Tilak, Swami Vivekananda and APJ Abdul Kalam, who toured India to understand it, Modi advised young Indians to do so too.
 
 “All these great men... tried to know and understand India; tried to live India within themselves. Can we make an effort as a student to learn, understand and try to live as per the traditions, culture, attire, eating habits and beliefs of different states, different societies, different groups of our country?” he asked.
 
 “...during these vacations do not go out just for a change but leave with the intention to know, understand and gain something. Internalise India. Internalise the diversities.”
 
 Coming just before the start of the peak tourist season in India (October to March), the PM asked Indian tourists to share their experiences with the government, through the MyGov and Na-Mo apps. He also asked people to suggest top seven destinations in every state.
