PUNE: Both   and   party workers are unhappy about their leaders moving towards forming an   for the civic polls in Pune.

 Congress city unit chief Ramesh Bagwe and NCP city chief   agreed that both parties should have a tie-up to fight ‘communal’ forces and hinted that they would finalize the seat sharing formula in a few days. Bagwe and Chavan have had preliminary discussions on the alliance and have decided to take forward the talks. However, party workers and aspirants have registered their protest over the proposed alliance. 
 
 Congress workers from the city have approached former chief minister Prithviraj Chavan who is the party’s election in-charge for Pune. Chavan has repeatedly opposed any understanding or an alliance with the NCP anywhere in the state. 
 
 “We have communicated our sentiments to Chavan and he has said he will take up the issue with senior state leaders,” a senior Congress leader said.
 
 Some NCP leaders in Pune met former deputy CM Ajit Pawar saying that the party must go alone in the polls. 
 
 Bagwe said a decision on an alliance will be taken only after consultations with party workers.
