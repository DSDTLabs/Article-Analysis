LUCKNOW: Alarmed by a large number of accidents on Agra-Lucknow Expressway, the state government has decided to install cameras on the 302-km stretch. The plan, which was mooted during the state cabinet meeting on Tuesday, entails installation of cameras on strategic points to keep a hawk-eyed vigil on over-speeding vehicles, illegal entry of heavy vehicles and ones plying wrong side. 

 Briefing reporters after the cabinet meeting, principal secretary (information)   said that use of cameras was being mulled as a long-term solution to check accidents on the expressway. He said that the state government would also seek more deployment of police on certain points to check illegal entry of heavy vehicles on the expressway. Lending a significant push to construction of the ambitious   connecting Lucknow with Ghazipur, the state cabinet headed by UP chief minister  , also set a deadline for completing the bids by March end. The expressway project, which is to be the longest in the country, would be constructed in eight packages, connecting Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Allahabad and Ayodhya.
