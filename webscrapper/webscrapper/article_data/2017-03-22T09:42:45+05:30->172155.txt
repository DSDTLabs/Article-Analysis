The popular Turkish show  , originally titled Fatmagül’ün Suçu Ne? (What Is Fatmagül’s Fault?) which has enjoyed a successful run in India over the last year, now has an official Indian adaptation that will air on Star Plus. Kya Qusoor Hai Amala Ka? has   stepping into Turkish actress Beren Saat’s shoes.
 
  The show revolved around a village girl, Fatmagul, who is engaged to marry a fisherman, Mustafa Nalçal, in a month’s time. Her dreams of a happy married life are shattered after she becomes a victim of a gang rape.
  
  
 
  
  The setting has moved to Dharamsala in the Indian adaptation but will continue to chronicle the anger and sorrow of the rape survivor as the people around her, including her own family, start judging her.
  
  “I learnt Himachali so I’d look like I was from Dharamsala and met a psychiatrist who deals in rape cases so I can project the pain and turmoil of her character convincingly. The writer of the Turkish show Ece Yorenc was flown down to speak to our team about the original show which I watched as part of the prep,” says Pankhuri who likes the simplicity of her character. “There’s no melodrama and every character has a back story.”
  
  Is she prepared for comparisons with the original? “Yes, we are. The audience loved the original so we will not divert too much from the main story,” she signs off.
