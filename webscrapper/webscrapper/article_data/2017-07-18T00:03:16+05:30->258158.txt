Madurai: A PIL has been filed at the Madurai bench of the Madras high court, seeking continuation of excavation at the archaeological site of Adhichanallur in Tuticorin district and direction to archaeological survey of India ( ) to file reports on previous excavations held at the site.

 The division bench headed by justice K K Sasidharan, which heard the petition, ordered notice to the Union culture secretary, director general of ASI, stateâ€™s archaeology secretary and commissioner, superintending archaeologist of ASI and Tuticorin district collector. 
 
 According to the petitioner, the ASI started excavation work at Adhichanallur in 2004 and found a burial site spread over 14 acres on the right bank of the Tamirabarani river. It unearthed hundreds of urns with human skeletons inside them and also iron weapons, gold ornaments, bronze material and other valuables. The skeletons found in the urns dated back to 3,800 years. The articles were later taken to Chennai. 
 
 The petitioner said that a German national, Jagor, had conducted an excavation at Adhichanallur in 1876 and unearthed 50 types of utensils, human skulls and skeletons, which are still preserved in a museum in Berlin in Germany. 
 
 The government set up a museum-cum-information centre at Adhichanallur a couple of years ago. However, it is yet to be opened. The Indian government should retrieve the articles from Germany and put the same in the museum here. The ASI which has a huge collection of articles found from Adhichanallur lying in Chennai should also display them at the museum.
 
 Hence, it is necessary to issue direction to the central and state government officials to continue excavation at Adhichanallur and to display the articles taken from Adhichanallur in the museum, the petitioner prayed.
