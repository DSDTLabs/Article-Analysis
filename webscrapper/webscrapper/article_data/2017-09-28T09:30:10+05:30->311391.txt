BENGALURU: Bengaluru is a happy hunting ground for leg-spinner  . The 27-year-old, who turns out for  , earned the Indian skipper's trust at the   franchisee and lived up to it with a six-wicket haul against England in the one-off T20 last year. With a good run in the ODI series so far, the Haryana bowler has also forged a successful partnership with chinaman   in this series.

 “We have played with each other a lot. If I bowl first, then I brief him about the wicket. If he bowls first, then he tells me about the wicket and the right areas to bowl,”he said.
 
 On the pitch, he said, “The wicket said, “The wicket has changed. The wicket now offers more assistance to the spinners. Unlike before, it is a bit slow and there is grip.”
