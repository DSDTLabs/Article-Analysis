KOZHIKODE: Police have dropped K P   alias Nadi from the list of the accused in the case related to the sighting of members of a Maoist squad at a tribal colony in Aralam in   district. 

 In a reply to a query under the Right to Information Act filed by Nadir, the DSP (internal security investigation branch) said that Nadir has been removed from the list of the accused and a has been submitted in the court.
 
 Nadir was arrested on the premises of the   Medical College Hospital in December 2016, in a case registered by the Iritty police. He was accused of barging into the Vietnam Colony inside the Aralam farm with other members of the People's Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) of the CPI (Maoist).
 
 Police claimed that witnesses had stated that Nadir was among the group that distributed copies of Kattuthee, the official mouthpiece of the Maoists and spent more than one hour at the colony. They also claimed that he had shown the revolver and the rounds he had with him to the inhabitants of the colony.
 
 He was released from the custody after the intervention from the human rights activists and political parties. But the police were reluctant to exonerate him from the case and his photo had appeared in the list of wanted Maoists. But the high court ordered that the case against Nadir should be conducted in a time-bound manner and a report should be submitted in the court.
 
 In his post in the Facebook, Nadir said that the police had identified the real accused and it was the confusion over the similarity with the person that created problem for him. "I won the case after a legal struggle that lasted for one-and-half-years," Nadir said in the post.
 
 "I had gone through untold mental agony in these years. I lost a job in the Gulf that could have fetched Rs 50,000 a month," he said in the post.
