MUMBAI: For the first time since it was commissioned last year, an 81m hydraulic platform was put to use on Sunday to rescue a labourer who was stranded on seventh floor of the   commercial complex that caught fire. 

 "While the ladder was taken along on various fire calls over the past year, this was the first time we used it," said a fire official.
 
 After a video of the labourer pleading for help from fire officials who were standing below started making rounds on Monday, citizens questioned the delay in rescuing him. In the video, the labourer can be seen standing at the edge and waving through the broken glass facade. 
 
  corporator   said that when he reached the spot around 4.30pm, he spotted the man seeking help. "He was brought down only around 6.30pm. There was a problem in fetching the ladder to the spot sooner. The man was gesturing that he would jump off. Had the fire gone out of control, it could have been life threatening," said Thakur. 
 
 Fire brigade's chief fire officer   said that the 81m hydraulic platform had to be called in from Borivli. "There was traffic on the way and hence, it was delayed. But once it arrived, we brought him down in 30 minutes."
 
 The 81m ladder was purchased for Rs 15 crore from a Finland-based company,  . The 81m ladder was brought in to bridge the gap between the 70m and 90m one that was commissioned in 2015.
