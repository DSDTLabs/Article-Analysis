AHMEDABAD:   has asked the   (VMC) to file an   on whether the rules of General Development Control Regulations (GDCR) were followed in   in the city. The court sought an answer after the issue of construction norms was raised in a PIL filed in 2015. Petitioner Rajesh Bhodwani’s advocate Hasit Dave submitted that the civic body granted permission to as many as 14 multiplexes in the city without proper scrutiny, and GDCR norms have been blatantly violated.

 It was submitted that according to GDCR norms, multiplexes fall under superstructures in commercial buildings and there are specific provisions that should be taken into consideration. All such buildings are required to leave six metres space open on three sides, but there is narrow space left. Citing the issue of public safety, petitioner’s advocate highlighted that due to such narrow space, fire engines cannot operate during the time of emergency.
 
 Advocate Dave also submitted about small parking spaces in multiplexes which have nearly 800 to 1,000 seats. But the parking space is for only 70-80 cars. This results in complete chaos on main roads, and traffic movement is hampered. The petitioner cited examples of two multiplexes in this regard. He further submitted that various representations had been made before all concerned authorities, but to no effect.
 
 On submission that Rule 18 of the GDCR has not been complied with, the bench of Chief Justice RS Reddy and Justice VM Pancholi directed VMC to explain this issue on an affidavit by March 21.
