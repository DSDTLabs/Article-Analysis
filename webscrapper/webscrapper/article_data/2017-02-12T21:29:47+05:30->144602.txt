Navi Mumbai: The civic administration was recently in an awkward spot after giving permission for a wedding to be held on a public playground. The   in sector 19,   became a venue for a glitzy wedding recently.

 A major portion of the ground was taken over to host the lavish event, said locals. Activists have been asking why the event was allowed to be held. 
 
 “The civic administration that prefers to conduct all procedures by the book and expect the residents to do so too, this blatant violation comes as a surprise. Public playgrounds are not meant for hosting personal events but NMMC seems clueless or unaware of this rule,” said resident and activist Anarjit Chauhan. 
 
 Surprisingly, after the activist sought a response from the administration on the online grievance redressal system, the ward office categorized the occasion as a religious function. “The reply stated that it was marriage and further described it as a religious function, which is beyond my understanding,” added Chauhan. 
 
 Vashi-based social activist Sandeep Thakur, who is a petitioner in a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) challenging the renting of playgrounds for weddings said he will file a civil petition in this regard. 
 
 “By allowing a private function to be held on civic playground, the administration has violated the provisions of section 37 (A) of MRTP Act. Since hearing on my PIL is pending, I will be drawing attention of the court to this violation through a civil petition,” said Thakur. 
 
 When contacted none of the civic officials were able to provide an explanation over the alleged violation. 
 
 Additional commissioner Ankush Chavan said, “I have sought and am waiting for an explanation from the deputy municipal commissioner.”
