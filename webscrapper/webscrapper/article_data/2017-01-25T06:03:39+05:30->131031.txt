GUWAHATI: The district administration has divided the city into   to carry out   on   shortly. 

 The campaigns will be carried out by the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), the   (ASDMA) and the Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC).
 
 "Guwahati is the most important and dense urban centre of the northeast. It is located in Zone V which is the most seismically active region of the country. Lack of adequate open spaces and high density of urban population will make disaster management very challenging," a statement of the administration said.
 
 The DDMA and ASDMA will conduct sensitization programmes on various hazards in all municipal wards. They will also hold mock earthquake drills in collaboration with the GMC, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), fire and emergency services,   (SDRF), civil defence, NGOs and civil society organizations.
 
 "The aim of the drill is to harness the strengths and capabilities of the local community and prepare them for urban catastrophes," said an official of the DDMA.
 
 For effective implementation of the programme, the city has been divided into the central, eastern and western zones. Three composite teams of NDRF, SDRF, fire and civil defence have been constituted to conduct three tabletop exercises and three mock drills in each zone.
 
 Elected representatives of the various municipal wards are one of the important stakeholders of the entire exercise. The ASDMA and DDMA recently conducted a meeting with the mayor and councillors and discussed the proposed campaign with them. 
 
 "The ward councillors are providing their full support and cooperation in making the programme a great success," said an official of the GMC.
