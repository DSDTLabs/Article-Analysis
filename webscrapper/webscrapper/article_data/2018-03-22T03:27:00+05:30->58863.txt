Chilakaluripet (Guntur): Launching a scathing attack on chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, YSR Congress Party chief Jaganmohan Reddy blamed Naidu for solely being responsible for Centre not granting special category status (SCS) to Andhra Pradesh. 

 He said that Naidu had virtually mortgaged SCS to Centre for his selfish gains and started voicing his concern on the issue only upon learning about the public anger in the state.
 
    was addressing a public meeting here on Wednesday. He said that Naidu’s decision to accept the special package two years ago did the biggest damage to the state’s interests. He rued that Andhra Pradesh would have easily achieved SCS, had Naidu turned down the package when Centre offered it two years ago. 
 
 “Instead of speaking against the package, Naidu had acknowledged his thanks and appreciation to the Centre for being generous to grant the package to the state. He denounced the SCS right on the floor of the assembly,” Jagan alleged. 
 
 He said that the chief minister had made every attempt to foil the agitations and protests launched by YSRCP and other political parties demanding SCS in the last two years. He said that the chief minister had openly threatened to send everyone who protested for SCS to jails. 
 
 After failing to meet his selfish ends, the chief minister started demanding SCS all of a sudden, Jagan alleged. “I wanted to know as to why Naidu could not raise the issue in the last two years,” he asked. 
 
 Jagan said that it was Naidu who bowed down his head to the Centre and shamelessly mortgaged the interests of the state. 
 
 He accused Naidu and his men for ‘looting’ the natural resources including sand and gravel in the satate.
 
  Party leaders Marri Rajasekhar, Kasu Mahesh Reddy, Ambati Rambabu, A Varaprasada Reddy and former MP Balasoury were also present during the public meet.
