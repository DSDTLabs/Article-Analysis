AMRITSAR: A garbage dump has yet again turned into an election issue in  . Nearly 40,000 residents living in the vicinity of the city's Bhagtanwala dump have announced to boycott candidates of all parties unless they give them a written assurance to shift the landfill from its present location.

 Nirmal Singh, a member of the joint committee that has been formed by the residents of the city's wards 37, 38, and 39 to demand that the dump be shifted, said they had decided to boycott the parties because none of them had given them a written assurance.
 
 He said former SAD leader and now Congress nominee  , Akali candidate   and AAP contestant Dr   had visited them several times and assured them that they would resolve the issue.“How can we trust their words? Every politician has been saying this for decades.We are dying and acquiring serious diseases due to the gases emitted from the dump,“ said a local resident, Surinder Singh.
 
 When he was the MLA, Bolaria had resigned from his party to demand that the dump be shifted. Nirmal said their area comprised nearly 40,000 people, and this could dent the winning prospects of any candidate.
 
 Sources in the constituency said leaders of all political parties were trying to woo the agitating residents. The agitation to demand the dump be shifted began in November 2014. Since then, residents of the three wards have been sitting on protest every day, except for a 42-day period when it was lifted.
 
 Another agitating resident of the area,  , said elections were the best time to raise their voice. “If they wouldn't do anything to shift the dump, we will not vote for them,“ he said. Nirmal said they were expecting individual meetings with all candidates contesting from Amritsar South in a day or two.
