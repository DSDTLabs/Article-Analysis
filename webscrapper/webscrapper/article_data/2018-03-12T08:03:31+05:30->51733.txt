CHENNAI: With the underground   getting ready on Anna Salai,   Limited (CMRL) has started to look for skilledworkers for maintaining its stations. It has floated tenders to outsource all services required for the functioning of the stations. The 3.3km underground line between Saidapet and AG-DMS is expected to open by April.

 Metro rail wants skilled workers to provide management services including mechanized housekeeping and manual cleaning, ticket vending, platform management, customer care and parking management services at all its underground stations that are getting ready to open. It includes four stations between Saidapet and AG-DMS, which are expected to open along with Central Metro and   this year.
 
 
 The underground stations require efficient airconditioning, cleaning and ventilation and will need professional agencies experienced in handling the operation. The agency will also carry out repairs and other safety checks like preventing water seepage inside the station. The platforms and tracks need to be cleaned so that the air is safer and pollution minimal.
 
 The stations between Saidapet and DMS are ready with only minor work that needstobecompletedbefore they could be opened. The entry and exittothestations like Nandanam and Teynampet are being built.
 
 CMRL is also looking for maintaining its other underground station that are still under construction including Thousand Lights, LIC and   as well as High Court, Mannadi and Washermenpet.
 
 However, the tender invite does not include Central and Egmore.
 
 CMRL began outsourcing some of the maintenance work when it started its first service between Koyambedu and Alandur in June 2015. “Outsourcing maintenance gets work done efficiently. We only have to monitor the performance,” an official said.
