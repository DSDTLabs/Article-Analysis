Bathinda: In a move to dissuade farmer’s organisation BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) Bathinda from burning wheat stubble, the district administration held two crucial meetings with the outfit on Wednesday. However, several activists held protests across the Malwa region outside the offices of the deputy commissioners (DCs) against the government’s action against burning of crop stubble.

 The activists demanded the government rescind the penalty imposed on farmers who burn crop stubble. According to them, if the government is serious, it should provide a compensation of Rs 2,000 per acre and eight hours of power supply to the farm sector to help them prepare fields without burning straw.
 
 “We put forward our point of view before the administrative officials in the back-to-back meetings and told them that some industrial units spread more pollution than straw burning. The farmers have no other option than burning straw, and it could be avoided if government accepts our demands,” said BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) leaders Jhanda Singh Jethuke and Shingara Singh Mann.
 
 Mreanwhile deceased farmer Mukhtiar Singh’s body could not be cremated even on Wednesday as the Bathinda district administration refused to accept the demand of farmer organisations which asked for Rs 10 lakh as compensation to his family and a job to one family member. Mukhtiar (65) had died of cardiac arrest during the International Labour Day protest on May 1. His body is lying at the Bathinda civil hospital. Bathinda DC Diprava Lakra said, “Though there is no such provision to compensate a family when he dies due to health problem, the administration will take up the matter with the state government on compassionate grounds.”
