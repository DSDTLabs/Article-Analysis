INDORE: Following a scuffle over a petty issue, a man allegedly doused his son with petrol and set him on fire. The victim's cousin also   when he tried to save him.

 The shocking incident took place in Pipliyahana Kankad in Kanadia area late on Saturday while the 18-year-old youth,  , was near his house. He allegedly got into a fight with his father Sajjan Singh.
 
 Sajjan, who sells balloons for a living, allegedly tried to take out petrol from his son’s motorcycle. “His son doesn’t let him drive his bike and so he was trying to take out petrol and use it in another bike as he had to go somewhere. When his son asked him not to do so, he started smashing the bike,” Jagdeesh Goyal, Kanadia police station in-charge said while speaking to TOI.
 
 Sunil and his cousin tried to stop Sajjan, following which the fight ensued and Sajjan allegedly threw the petrol that he had taken out from Sunil’s bike. “Sajjan took out a matchstick and set Sunil on fire. His cousin also sustained burns while trying to save Sunil,” said Goyal.
 
 Neighbours and locals present at the spot immediately doused the flames and rushed both of them to a nearby clinic. The neighbours thrashed the father for his misdeed.
 
 Kanadia police were informed about the incident on Sunday morning, after which Sunil and his cousin were shifted to MY hospital for treatment. Doctors claimed their condition was stable.
 
 “We have registered an attempt to murder case against the father and he has been arrested. However, we are trying to interrogate family members on why they didn’t inform us about the incident earlier,” said Goyal.
