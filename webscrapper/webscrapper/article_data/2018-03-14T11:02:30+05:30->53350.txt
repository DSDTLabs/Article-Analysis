NEW DELHI: Clarifying his stand on beef ban in Tripura, BJP leader   said that states in which beef is consumed by majority population, the ban should not be imposed.

 
  â€œHere (in Tripura) there are lots of Christians and Muslims, there are also some Hindus who consume beef. I believe that there shouldn't be a ban on it (consuming beef)," Deodhar clarified.
 
  
  
 Deodhar, who played an instrumental role in BJP's victory in the recently concluded assembly polls in the state, said that ban on beef in a particular state should take into account the preferences of the majority population in that state. 
 
  Some decisions must be taken keeping in view the people's sentiments, Deodhar said.
 
  Last year, a senior BJP leader had assured the people of Meghalaya that if his party comes to power in the state then it would not impose a ban on beef, but would regulate the rates and slaughter houses to allow for an ease of meat consumption.
 
  Earlier this month, the National People's Party, with BJP as one of its ally, came to power in the state.
 
  Following the victory of BJP-led NDA alliance at the Centre in 2014, the saffron party had made ban on beef one its main political agendas. 
 
  There have been several instances of cow-related violence, including assault, harassment and extortion, especially against people belonging to the minority community and lower-caste Hindus.
 
  As per a Reuters report, between 2010 and 2017, twenty-eight people have been killed and 124 injured in cow-related violence in the country.
