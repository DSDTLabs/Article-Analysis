THANE: A much-married conman, Abhay Gawat (42), from Sindhudurg was arrested by the Kalwa police for tying a knot with a woman and cheating her and her family of Rs 20 lakh. 

 Gawat had told the woman’s family that he was employed with the   (Mhada). Gawat met the woman on a matrimonial website. “He left his first wife and married a divorcee having two children. He married the woman in Kalwa and but didn’t disclose his history. They married in a simple ceremony, but Gawat knocked off Rs 20 lakh from the woman and her relatives,” said a police officer.
 
 The Kalwa police nabbed him recently from Vasari in Thane district and found that he has cheated several people. “He would identify himself as former chief minister Narayan Rane’s son-in-law or Maharashtra minister Pankaja Munde’s cousin to his target victims. He told his unsuspecting victims that he owned a oil factory,” the officer added. 
 
 During the probe, it transpired that he had cheated a senior railway officer of Rs 72 lakh on the pretext of starting an shelter for senior citizens. “We are probing the case from all the angles. But a primary probe reveals that the accused met the railway officer and even showed him a plot of land where he was planning to build an old age home. Through his contacts, the officer paid Rs 72 lakh,” said the officer. Gawat fled after getting the cash. 
 
 “We suspect that Gawat has cheated many people and we expect his victims to approach us in the days to come,” said a police official.
