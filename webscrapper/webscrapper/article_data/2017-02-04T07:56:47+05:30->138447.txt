JODHPUR: An   has been registered by the   (JNVU) against two professors, one from the  , Delhi and the other of JNVU for   in a   organized by the Department of English.

 Besides this, an inquiry committee has also been set up by JNVU administration to probe in all aspects of the seminar, where the incident took place on Thursday. 
 
 The action followed protest by   members after Nivedita Menon, who teaches Political Science at JNU, delivered an anti-national speech in a session, “History Reconstructed through Literature”.
 
 Vice chancellor R P Singh has registered an FIR against Menon and organising secretary of the English department, Raj Shree Ranawat, has also set up an inquiry into the matter.
 
 “We have registered an FIR against Menon and Ranawat besides constituting an inquiry team to look into the entire episode starting from the invitation of Menon till her speech in the seminar,” Singh said. In her address, Menon showed the Indian flag upside down during a slide presentation and said that she kept the flag in this position even in her office.
 
 Menon, raising the question on the map of India and also on Tricolour said everybody calls it Bharat Mata but I do not see any Mata in this map. I see it this way because the earth is round and if so, a map can be seen anyways.
 
 She further said that she did not accept this map and Tricolour, which she thinks not original. “The flag is not original. It belonged to post-independent India. Earlier, it did not have any spiked ring in its center,” she said. Menon also spoke against the Indian Army and Hinduism.
 
 Though, shocked by her speech, the session was put to an abrupt end to avoid any further embarrassment, but it led to widespread resentment among students who shut all the faculties of the university and demanded action from the vice chancellor.
