The Nashik rural   have decided to start   counselling centres at its head office in Adgaon and   within the next few days.

 A senior official said that there was a large number of domestic violence cases lodged at various police stations in the rural areas. Most   involved in these cases are in the age bracket of 25-35. In some cases, the couples approached the police two months after their wedding. On this backdrop, they had decided to start the pre-marriage   centre.
 
 Ankush Shinde, superintendent of Nashik rural police, said, “Marriage brings two families together. But, the lack of communication or misunderstanding between the husband and wife, coupled with financial responsibilities and ego clashes leads to arguments involving all the families. Such things can be resolved through talks as many times, the ego of the husband or wife or their respective families comes in the way, because of which the couple decided to separate from one another.”
 
 Shinde said that the centre could be the first in the state in any police department. “The aim of starting the counselling centre is to guide the couple on problems they may face in their married lives and how they can tackle it,” he said. Youths about to get married can register online once the counselling centre starts. Once, the police gets 30 applications, they will decide the date to call the people.
