Kanyakumari/Tirunelveli: No cases were booked by the Kanyakumari district police while more than  ,900 cases were booked by the Tirunelveli city and district police units on Monday to prevent road accidents by mischief mongers in the pretext of New Year celebrations.

 “We did not want the public to start the New Year on a sad note. Booking them for various violations would hurt their sentiments, but we caught more than 1,100 motorists indulging in different violations. Most of them were youth and instead of booking cases we organised awareness programs for them,” said Kanyakumari SP M Durai.
 
 Talking to TOI, the SP said that intensive vehicle checks were organised from the late hours of Sunday at accident prone spots and vulnerable places where youth would engage in rash driving and over speeding. This included quite a few pockets on the Beach Road and other connecting roads.
 
 Around 1,100 vehicles were caught in 12 places by 11 pm. Their vehicles were seized for a couple of hours, during which time police officers gave advice to the violators. They were surprised with a cake cutting ceremony when the clock struck 12. The SP took part in the cake cutting at Vadasery Junction and Vettunimadam Junction.
 
 “The initiative was successful. The offenders were happy over the way the events were organised and that they were not booked. No fatality was reported that night” the SP added. Thousands of people thronged the Sunrise Point at Kanyakumari to witness the first sun rise of 2018.
 
 Tirunelveli district police were engaged in intensive vehicle checks at 117 places while 63 four-wheeler patrolling teams were also engaged in ensuring peaceful New Year celebrations.
