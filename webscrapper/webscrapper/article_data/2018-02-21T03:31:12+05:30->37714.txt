 A delegation of women auto drivers had complained that the male auto drivers at the auto stand near D-mart mall in Panvel were not allowing the women auto drivers to wait in queue at the auto stand, she added. "Hence,we have put a notice at the said auto stand warning the male auto drivers that legal action will be taken if they prevent the women drivers form waiting in queue at the auto stand as long as their autos are registered and are plying legally as permitted by Panvel RTO."
 
 She said, "We are surveying the other nodes in our jurisdiction like near railway stations and malls and inquiring whether the women auto drivers in those areas are facing similar problems. Accordingly, legal action will be taken against the miscreant male auto drivers."
 
 Panvel RTO has no plans to start separate auto stands for women auto drivers. But it will be ensured that the women auto drivers get equal right of waiting in queue at auto stands across Panvel taluka, said Patil.
