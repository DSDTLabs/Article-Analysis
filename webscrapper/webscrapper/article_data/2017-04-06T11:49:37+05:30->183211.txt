VARANASI: Rajya Sabha member and former SP leader   on Wednesday slammed SP patriarch   and party supremo   for the treatment he had received at their hands, but praised UP's BJP government led by Aditya Nath Yogi for waiving loans of farmers. 

 "I will never forget the treatment given to me by the father-son duo. Mulayam Singh forgot all what I had done for him and his family. Now after being ousted from SP, I have no political relation with him," he said.
 
 Singh, along with Jaya Prada, was at Vindhyachal in Mirzapur district to take part in a programme organised on the occasion of Ram Navmi on Wednesday. 
 
 He also offered prayers at Vindhyavasini temple on the occasion. Talking to reporters, Singh said that Mulayan Singh politically deceived him. 
 
 Targeting Akhilesh, he said that he (Akhilesh) gave a slogan 'kaam bolta hai' by highlighting the incomplete Metro and highways projects. Singh also targeted senior SP leader Azam Khan and said that he did not spare even the land of graveyard.
 
 Singh praised Aditya Nath Yogi government for waiving farmers loans. "The government is working for the welfare of the poor," he added.
