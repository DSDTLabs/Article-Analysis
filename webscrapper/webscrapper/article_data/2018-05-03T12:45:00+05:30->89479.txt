PUNE: Her dedication to arts has always stood her in good stead – right from being the   doodle winner in 2014 to bagging a 100% scholarship at  , where the acceptance rate is below 7% of the total applications.

 Her feat is all the more spectacular in a country where conventional thinking favours opting for science after Class X. Vaidehi Reddy chose arts even after scoring over 90% in Class X and never regretted her decision. Her parents believe it is her choice of subject that made all the difference to her. 
 
 “The College of Architecture, Art and Planning, has approved her application to   University for the fall of 2018. A financial assistance of $66645, which includes tuition fee, dining fee, books, housing, health, miscellaneous and transportation charges, among others, will be provided by the university. All we have to pay for is her visa, her flight tickets and her art supplies,” said Vaidehi’s mother Gayatri.
 
 Vaidehi (17) is currently awaiting her Class XII results. “I am really excited about this opportunity. The biggest difference in bachelor of fine arts courses in Indian universities and Cornell is that here, we teach the skill of painting but not the philosophy of art. I want my art to make a difference,” she said.
 
 Vaidehi hopes to land a job in Pixar or   studio one day. Her mother is a housewife and her father is in government service. Sending their daughter abroad without a scholarship was impossible for them. But both parents had complete faith in her abilities. “The message we want to send out to parents is to support their kids if they show special interest in something, or if they have a talent ,” said Gayatri.
 
 Vaidehi also was the sole representative from India as a ‘web ranger’ in the Google Global Summit held at the search engine's headquarters in San Francisco in 2016. She had also won the second prize in International Korean tourism award last year.
