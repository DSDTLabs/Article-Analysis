LUCKNOW: The next Lok   elections may be less than a year from now, but the   government steered clear of populism in its budget for 2018-19.

 While about Rs 14,000 crore has been set aside for new projects, the government did not announced any big-ticket scheme in the budget. Instead of kick-starting any big project or social welfare scheme which may take time in implementation and results becoming visible, the Yogi government has transferred the major portion of state’s budget to ongoing Centrally sponsored schemes which are catering to the needs of farmers, youth and rural areas.
 
 Addressing newspersons soon after the budget was tabled by finance minister Rajesh Agarwal, Yogi claimed that the budget would play a key role in providing jobs to youth, push industrial growth and increase agricultural production thereby helping farmers to achieve double price of their cost of production.

 The farmer focus was evident in nearly Rs 8,400 crore allocation for agriculture sector and the foodgrain target being raised to 581 lakh metric tonnes. The government has earmarked Rs 68,000 crore for education, Rs 29,000 crore for roads and Rs 28,000 crore for power, totalling around Rs 1,27,500 crore, i.e., roughly one third of the total annual budget for more than other 80 departments.
 
 Besides giving a lion’s share to infrastructure, education, energy and health, the budget also provides Rs 98 crore for cow shelters in all districts, Rs 1,500 crore for Kumbh celebrations, Rs 100 crore for Brij Pilgrimage Development Council and Rs 70 crore for promoting tourism. Yogi Adityanath’s home district Gorakhpur has also been showered with projects and funds for development. The budget for minority development, too, has seen a marginal rise of Rs 280 crore-.However, only Rs 500 crore was allocated for various Metro projects in the state and nearly Rs 2,000 crore for Poorvanchal Expressway, Bundelkhand Expressway and near-complete Agra-Lucknow Expressway even though the combined estimated cost of Metros and eways would not be less than 1,50,000 crore.
 
 In a bid to promote traditional industries and handicraft, Rs 250 crore has been given for one district one product (ODOP) scheme.
 
 The budget has special focus on Bundelkhand region and provides for digging of 5,000 ponds to meet the challenge of water scarcity and Rs 131crore for solar-powered water pumps.
