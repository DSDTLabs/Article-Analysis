High-ranking retired officials of public sector banks who allegedly indulged in malpractices and didn’t face any action by banks will now come under the scanner of the  .

 The   has asked all PSBs to make sure any matter related to vigilance/corruption against retired senior officials of banks is reported to the commission at the first stage itself so that it is able to refer such cases promptly to the  , if needed.
 
 The move comes after the CBI booked several top-ranking former officials of stateowned banks on charges of corruption and irregularities.
 
 The CVC, in a communication last week, told the banks that the “Commission is required to be consulted at first stage (pertaining to misconduct or vigilance/corruption) as well as second stage (when action/penalty is being decided), in matters of retired officers, i.e. officers of SMGS-V (Senior Management Grade Scale-V) and above (AGMs to CMDs), as per the prescribed procedure when action is proposed to be initiated after retirement under the pension regulations too”.
 
 The decision was taken after the CVC found that PSBs are not consulting it for first stage advice — which pertains to matters related to vigilance or before initiating action under pension regulations. The trigger, sources said, was a case where the   management took a decision on charges against a DGM without keeping the CVC in the loop.
 
 When contacted, central vigilance commissioner   told TOI, “We had taken the (UCO) matter as a policy issue and reported it to the department of financial services. We said whoever is under the jurisdiction of the CVC has to consult the commission on retired officers.”
 
 CBI officials pointed out that banks do not report corruption matters against senior management/officers in time and sometimes, complaints pertaining to frauds involving hundreds of crores are sent after 2-3 years.
