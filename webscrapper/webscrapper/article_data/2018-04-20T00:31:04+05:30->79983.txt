NEW DELHI:   may not be allowed at   for the   as it is yet to prove   in its   to the   ( ). 

 After noticing a number of deficiencies last year, AICTE asked for a compliance report. After the college failed to submit the report, a showcause notice was sent to it on October 11. The college was also called for a hearing on January 11 where it was placed under the ‘No Admission’ category for 2018-19.
 
 Following a review plea on February 5, the college was again asked to file some documents. However, it reportedly didn’t submit some documents again. Principal O P Verma claimed all documents were submitted on time “but our land documents are for GB Pant Polytechnic College. According to AICTE rules, the land documents should be the same as the college’s name”. The college will appeal again on Friday.
 
 M P Poonia, vice-chairman of AICTE, also said the college could appeal before its executive council meeting on April 26.
