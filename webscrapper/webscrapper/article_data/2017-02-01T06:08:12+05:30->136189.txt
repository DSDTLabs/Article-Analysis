BENGALURU:   started his first day at work as director general and inspector general of police (DG&IGP) on Tuesday by, perhaps unintentionally, criticizing the  , of which he was special director (internal security) till the previous day. While talking about improving the quality of investigation in the  , Dutta said the current functioning of the CBI would result in the collapse of the system.

 While speaking to the media after assuming office, Dutta wondered why cases should go to the CBI, which comprises officers from the different states.
 
 “I was in the CBI and I know how it is dealing with the cases. It will be (end in) total collapse of the system if things go on like this. So in the states, we need to make investigations at police stations stronger,“ he said.
 
 Dutta, a 1981 batch IPS officer of the Karnataka cadre, was the most senior officer in the CBI and had completed three terms in the agency.The Centre recently appointed Delhi police commissioner   as the new CBI director.
 
 Asked about the Centre's decision to appoint Verma instead of him as the agency director, Dutta said: “I don't want to comment on the government's decision. All I can say is that I have no sadness because I know that I have done my best in the organisation. I have worked for over 12 hours every day and held charge of all zones, over a span of three tenures. I have done my best.“
 
  
  
 
 He went on say that if given a choice between serving in the CBI and the state police, he would choose the latter as the state government had shown confidence in him and given him the responsibility of leading the Karnataka police.
 
 The order regarding his appointment was issued by the Karnataka government last Friday, and Dutta took charge from outgoing police chief Om Prakash on Tuesday. Dutta will have a ninemonth tenure as he is set to retire in October this year.
