Singer   had to stop her Sydney concert after a fan collapsed with a cardiac arrest. 

 The Grammy winner was forced to halt the performance when a 47-year-old woman suffered the heart condition and emergency services were called.
 
  More than 95,000 fans had made their way to the ANZ stadium last night and had to clear a path to allow paramedics to get to the ill woman. 
 
  
  
 The fan was taken to a local hospital in a serious condition, and Adele seemed upset about what had happened. 
 
 Eyewitness   says she was sitting in the next row from the woman. "She (Adele) stopped the concert and she was like, 'I'm so sorry but someone got hurt and I have to check they're okay'."
 
 "She actually seemed really tearful."
