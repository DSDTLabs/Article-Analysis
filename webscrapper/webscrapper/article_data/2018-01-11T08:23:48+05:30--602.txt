NEW DELHI: Having failed to muster enough support in the   to pass legislation banning instant “talaq-e-biddat (triple talaq)”, the government is likely to take the ordinance route to criminalise it.

 According to sources, the government is looking at all options, including bringing an ordinance and convening a joint session of Parliament during the budget session to get the legislation passed without having to go through the Rajya Sabha, where the bill faces formidable opposition hurdles.
 
 The bill to criminalise talaq-e-biddat was passed by the   in the winter session but is stuck in the Rajya Sabha with opposition parties as well as NDA ally TDP having reservations over criminal provisions in the draft law.
 
 Asection of MPs in the upper House had demanded that the bill be referred to a parliamentary committee for review. The   and various women’s groups too are ranged against the bill. The women’s groups are particularly opposed to the criminal provisions in the bill.
 
 The bill proposes to make triple talaq a cognisable and non-bailable offence and provides for three-year imprisonment along with a fine. At least half a dozen BJP states have backed the bill. Tamil Nadu was the only non-BJP state to send its response to the Centre but it demanded that the criminal provisions in the bill be dropped. The legislation is applicable only to instant triple talaq and not on talaq.
