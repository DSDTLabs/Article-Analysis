HYDERABAD: It has been four years since the city hosted a Test match and the   (HCA) is leaving no stone unturned to make the one-off India-Bangladesh Test match beginning here on February 9 a grand success. 

  Denizens were slow on the uptake as news slowly trickled in that the world No.1 Test team assembled here on Monday and hit the ground running. But there should be no dearth of enthusiasm on Thursday.
 
 HCA secretary   informed that ticket prices will range between 100 and 1,000 and they are available on www.eventsnow.com 
 
 Keeping with the   ( ) directive to all state associations, the HCA has ensured a large turnout of school children on the days the matches are scheduled to be held. Nearly 5,000 seats have been allotted to schoolchildren every day and they will be seated in Eastern and Western stands. "Arrangements are on in full swing. Nearly 1,600 school children from St Andrews have confirmed their presence for the first day," the HCA secretary told TOI. 
 
 The Bangladesh team, who will be playing their first Test on Indian soil, arrived here nearly a week ahead of the match to acclimatise to the conditions after a poor tour of New Zealand. If their performance in the tour game was any indication, Hyderabadi fans have plenty to look forward to from   and the team.
