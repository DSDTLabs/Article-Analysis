AHMEDABAD: Gujarat   has got its new chairman as the board members and the director elected   from Rajkot for the post. Retired IPS officer A I Saiyed was the last chairman of the board.

 Hira has been members of the Board in the last term also, which ended in 2016. The state government got a flak for not constituting a new board for more than a year and it had to assure   high court that it would form the Board by October 31.
 
 However, the governmentâ€™s failure to form the new wakf Board led to filing of a contempt of court petition earlier this month. Finally, the state government appointed members of the Board last month with majority of them being repeated.
 
 As soon as the new Wakf Board was formed, two PILs were filed in the high court seeking its dissolution claiming that the election process was not undertaken for appointment of members in certain categories.
 
 The Board has also been in a controversy after it granted nod to the sale of 26 properties of religious trusts, which are regulated by the Wakf body, despite the Wakf Act prohibited any such sale in 2013.   refused to comment on the issue stating that these issues are sub-judice.
