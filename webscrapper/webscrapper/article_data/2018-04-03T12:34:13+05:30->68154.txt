Despite her chock-a-block schedule, Rituparna Sengupta has always remained involved with the cause of artistes in Tollygunge, helping many in need. Now the superstar has been nominated as the president of Shilpi Sangsad, a forum of artistes in the Bengali film industry. Earlier, some of the greats like Uttam Kumar and Supriya Devi helmed the post. The announcement was made yesterday at Nehru Childrenâ€™s Museum in presence of Goutam Ghose, Madhabi Mukherjee and others. Rituparna was very close to Supriya Devi and would often visit the ailing actress. The yesteryear actress breathed her last on January 26.
