NEW DELHI: Hours before campaigning for the reserved Charilam assembly seat ended on Saturday, the CPM-led Left Front in   withdrew its candidate from the race citing “extremely terrible situation” in the tribal-dominated area as the reason for pulling out. BJP’s  , sworn in as deputy CM in the government, and who was BJP’s candidate from Charilam, will now be elected to the Tripura assembly, unopposed.

 A day earlier, a   delegation had petitioned chief election commissioner Om Prakash Rawat to put off the Charilam assembly polls until peace and normalcy was restored in the state.
 
 Tripura has witnessed sporadic post-poll violence following the BJP-IPFT combine upset the 25-year-old Left Front government in the state. The CPM has claimed that the violence was “instigated and endorsed” by the BJP. BJP has denied the charge.
 
 On Saturday, however, following CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury’s arrival in Tripura and a spot check of the areas that have allegedly been attacked, the CPM issued a statement that it had decided to withdraw from the race since the EC did not respond to its request.
 
 Polling could not be held in Charilam on February 18 due to the death of the CPM candidate. It was scheduled to be held on March 12. “The situation in Charilam assembly constituency is horrifically bad due to reign of terror since the BJP got the majority in the election on Saturday,” Left Front convener   said.
