COIMBATORE: The city police on Friday arrested six members of Puratchikara Ilaignar Munnani (Revolutionary Youth Front), who were attempting to send   to Prime Minister   to condemn 12% goods and services tax (GST) on them.

 The protesters had gathered in front of the head post office to send sanitary napkins in small parcels to the PM. They told reporters that the central government exempted many products from GST, which are not essential. “However, it fixed 12% GST on sanitary napkins and 18% GST on food for children. However, pizzas attract only 5% GST,” a protester said.
 
 “Students and women have been protesting against the 12% GST on sanitary napkins. But the government did not take any step to reduce it. The State government reduced the entertainment tax for cinema industries, but ignored women’s demand. To condemn the Union government for implementing GST, we will send sanitary napkins to the PM, union finance minister Arun Jaitely and union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman,  , Menaka Gandhi and  ,” she said.
 
 Variety Hall Road police registered a case against the protesters, including three women. They were let off in the evening.
