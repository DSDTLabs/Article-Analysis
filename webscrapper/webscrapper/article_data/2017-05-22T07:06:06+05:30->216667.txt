The   has always believed in empowering its readers. In its 179 years of existence, the   and its readers have moved in tandem — both  , shaping and being shaped by people and events around them. Look in the mirror for one and you will inevitably find the other. 

 In addition to informing, educating and entertaining, TOI has been happy to play the role of friend and facilitator. For instance, in 2008, it launched ‘Pune Next’ as part of its drive to find out what lies ahead for the city. From corporate czars to bureaucrats and from international experts to the man on the street, all were given a platform to share their ideas on ways and means to transform Pune into the country’s IT/knowledge capital. 
 
 Under ‘City Of Angels’, every week we brought you inspiring stories of ordinary men and women doing extraordinary work — without any expectation of fame or even recognition — to better the lives of the less privileged in the city. 
 
 From overarching national campaigns such as ‘India Poised’ and ‘Lead India’ to more city-focus initiatives like ‘Living on the Edge’ and ‘Every Drop Counts’, The Times of India has consistently focused its energies on issues and concerns that resonate with our rainbow coalition of readers. 
 
 Where we have believed we can make a difference, we have not hesitated to take up cudgels — for instance, our campaign against noise pollution. We are particularly proud of our organ donation drive — in the five years since it was launched, there has been a sea change in the attitudes of governments, institutions and the public on what is quite literally a matter of life and death. 
 
 At a more local level, TOI has tackled head-on civic issues such as roads and transport, health and education, water and electricity, pollution and open spaces with the same clarity of purpose and doggedness that has placed it in a position to lead change across the country for so long. 
 
 This is the power we want to share with you more and more. By giving you multiple platforms to articulate your problems, highlight the dirty and the tardy, and most importantly, to right a wrong. With social media being a big part of our lives, TOI has not only occupied top-of-mind space on FB and Twitter, it is also redefining how news and views are sourced, distributed and consumed.
