HYDERABAD: Chillies keep generating heat on the ruling TRS with the   market yard still being the core of the issue and opposition parties leaving no stone unturned to win the hearts of the farmers. 

 After the Congress, Left Parties and Telugu Desam leaders visited Khammam, it was the turn of BJP legislature party leader   to meet the chilli farmers arrested and lodged in the sub-jail. However, Kishan Reddy was nabbed for taking out a rally in solidarity with the chilli farmers in Khammam. Cops said the BJP leader who was released later had violated prohibitory orders. 
 
 Reddy met the farmers in jail and said the failure of the state government had prompted the farmer- friendly Centre to announce remunerative price for chilli through market intervension scheme. "Even now, the ruling TRS wants to pass the buck on the Centre stating that the remunerative price is not enough and should be increased. Why don't the ruling TRS give the remaining money as bonus so that farmers get break-even price?," he added.
 
 The Congress blamed both the Centre and state government for the plight of chilli farmers despite a bumper crop. "Even today, the ruling TRS is not coming forward to give bonus in addition to the remunerative price from the Centre. Having seen the real face of the TRS farmers will teach them a befitting lesson," AICC former Secretary and Deputy leader in the   Ponguleti   said.
 
 Telangana Rythu Sangham leaders hit out at the state government for leaving the farmers to the middlemen's mercy and not coming to their rescue. "It is the responsibility of the state government to extend remunerative price for chilli," said Sangham state vice-president Bonthala Chandra Reddy. Marketing minister   and roads and buildings minister Tummala Nageswara Rao tightened grip on traders for fast trading of chillies that triggered the unrest.
