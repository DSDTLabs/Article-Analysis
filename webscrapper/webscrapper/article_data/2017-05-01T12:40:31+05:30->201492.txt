NEW DELHI:  's man-in-form   lost his control while batting against   in Match 37 of the   on Sunday.

 Chasing a massive 210-run target, KKR were reduced to 12/2 in 2.3 overs with both their openers - Gautam Gambhir (11) and Sunil Narine (1) back in the pavilion that might have left Uthappa, the new batsman at the crease, frustrated. After getting off the mark with a boundary between mid-on and mid-wicket off  , Uthappa was clearly seen shouldering the bowler when he was walking towards his partner Manish Pandey at the end of the third over.
 
 Apparently Kaul was shocked by Uthappa's reaction which was totally uncalled for. The incident prompted Sunrisers batsman   to intervene when the match was interrupted due to rain. Yuvarj went to Uthappa and had a chat with him perhaps making him realize that what he had done was completely against the spirit of the game.
 
 
  
 Skipper David Warner's 59-ball 126-run innings helped Sunrisers notched up a comfortable 48-run win over table-toppers Knight Riders.
