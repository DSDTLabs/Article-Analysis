SURAT: Many Surtis and residents of Dumas will gather at   on Tuesday to pay tributes to the soldiers of   from Dumas, Bhimpore and Gaviyar villages who died fighting in World War-I from 1914 to 1918. A total of 34 soldiers from these villages had died in the Battle of Basra.

 Hundreds of people from Surat, Dumas, Bhimpore and Gaviyar villages will gather at the monument built at Langar crossroads to pay tributes to these 34 soldiers who made the supreme sacrifice along with thousands of other   about 100 years ago. Students from the villages will offer a guard of honour to martyrs at the memorial. 
 
 British rulers had built the memorial at Langar crossroads with names of the 34 martyrs engraved on it in January 1928. Later, they even placed a 15-tonne iron anchor at the Langar crossroads on way to Dumas beach, a picnic spot for Surtis. The memorial depicts names of the 34 soldiers from Dumas, Bhimpore and Gaviyar villages who died in the Battle of Basra. However, not many locals are aware about its significance. 
 
 “Every year, we organize a small function to pay tributes to the soldiers, but this year we are trying to involve more people from the city. The monument is protected by locals as the authorities don’t do enough. It a matter of great pride for us that the soldiers from our villages had fought in a battle so far from our homeland in the World War-I,” said Ramesh Lashkari, a local resident. 
 
 “Thousands of people visit Dumas daily, but very few know about the importance of this monument. We thought about creating awareness about the sacrifice made by the soldiers from our villages in the centenary year of World War-I. We are hopeful that many Surtis will join us in paying tributes to the soldiers,” said  , who is working to create awareness about the contribution of these soldiers in the war. Bhatt and his friend Shailesh Tank had made a short film in 2017 about the participation of young men from the villages here in the World War-I.
