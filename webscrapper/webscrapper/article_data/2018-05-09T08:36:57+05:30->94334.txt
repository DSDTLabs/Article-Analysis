ALLAHABAD: The   (CBI) is scanning the answer copies of all sub-divisional magistrates and deputy superintendents of police, who were selected through Provincial Civil Services exams conducted by the   (UPPSC) from 2012 to 2017, after lodging the first FIR in the case on May 5. The agency is probing 584 results through which 19,000 recruitments were done during the five-year period. About 360 SDMs and  , posted across the state, are under   scanner. The probe started in the first week of February and the first FIR was lodged against unidentified UPPSC officials and persons on May 5. 

 
 
 As per the FIR, the commission officials had connived with the candidates to help them clear the exams.
 
 They kept mum about those candidates who were making ‘unique features’ in the answer scripts for identification during evaluation.
 
 “Some candidates marked unique features in their answer scripts, which could have easily led to their identification during evaluation of the answer scripts. However, none of the evaluator or UPPSC official pointed out the conduct of the candidates during evaluation of the answer scripts. Moreover, no marks were deducted on this count. This shows ulterior motive on the part of unknown officials of UPPSC,” said the FIR lodged by DSP (CBI) Satendra Singh.
