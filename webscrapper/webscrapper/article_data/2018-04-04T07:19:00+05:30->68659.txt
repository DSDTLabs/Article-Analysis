GURUGRAM: The department of town and country planning ( ) on Monday cancelled occupation certificates issued under the self-certification system to seven residential buildings in   2 for violating building norms. Officials claimed the action was aimed at checking misuse of the scheme that was launched in January to reduce the time for processing OC applications for residential houses in licensed colonies as well as decrease the pendency rate at the   office.

 “It has emerged that changes were made in the buildings on individual plots, particularly those of smaller sizes, after receiving OCs. The OCs are hereby withdrawn. One cannot make changes in building after getting OCs, without necessary approval,” said district town planner (DTP) RS Batth.
 
 The irregularities were found during random inspections of the plots/houses, which were given OCs recently by the department under the self- self-certification scheme. “Officials had randomly checked eight files from Sushant Lok 2, of which seven were found not to be in proper order. The plot owners were found to have made changes in designs or structures after receiving OCs for their 60sq-yard plots. 
 
 “The owners have either increased the ground coverage or made changes in internal designs of their houses or built additional floors,” said a senior official.
 
 The department introduced self-certification system in January, doing away with the mandatory inspection of sites by a junior engineer before granting OC. 
 
 Under the new system, a plot owner, through his architect, can give an undertaking that all rules were followed and submit it along with the OC application. Subsequently, the department issues the OC, presuming that the owner has followed the rules.
 
 “The self-certification scheme was introduced to simplify the process and bring in transparency. But we cannot allow misuse of the system. We will conduct random inspections before or after granting OCs to crack down on violators,” said Batth.
