In the latest episode of  , Shivaay tells Anika, Dadi, Omkara, Gauri, Rudra and Bhavya that the society romanticises the idea of parenthood. It is not as rosy as it is shown in films or TV. 

 
 Gauri counters Shivaay and tells him that it is a beautiful feeling to see your child smiling, eating and walking for the first time. She further tells him how special it feels when the child calls papa and mumma for the first time. They all visualise themselves with their kids, having a joyous time. 
 
 However, Shivaay cuts through and makes them see the other side of the story. He tells them how they won’t be able to spend time with their spouses and their world would then revolve around their kids. They will have problems at night when the baby won’t sleep and how all this would lead to fights between them. 
 
 
 Shivaay then apologises to Dadi for putting forth his opinions uninhibitedly. Dadi tells him she is fine with it. When she asks each couple if they are ready for a new member, Gauri tells her she is. Omkara supports her and tells Dadi he will be a better dad than his own father. Shivaay tells him he would be the best. 
 
 
 Shivaay finds Anika disturbed and asks her the reason. She tells him she understands that he doesn’t want a baby and goes to her room. Shivaay follows her and finds her crying. It is then that Anika reveals she has a feeling she might be pregnant. This leaves Shivaay surprised. He then asks her if this is what she wanted to talk about in the morning, Anika nods. 
 
 
 Shivaay looks at all the special arrangements Anika had made to inform him about the good news. He feels disappointed with himself. He apologises to Anika and tells her that she has his full support and they are in it together. He also tells her that he wouldn’t have said all that, had he known before. They decide to pay a visit to the doctor to confirm the news.
