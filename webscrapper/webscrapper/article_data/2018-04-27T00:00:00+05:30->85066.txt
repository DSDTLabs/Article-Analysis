One of the biggest reasons for Bengaluru having a low voter turnout is the fact that there is just too much apathy. This is a very do-it-to-me society, filled with arm-chair analysts, in which no one takes responsibility.   need to wake up. They need to instill the national pride within themselves, and understand the responsibility that they have with this opportunity to  . They must not squander this.
Being the daughter of an army officer, I have always exercised my right to franchise. The fact that today there are a lot more   and people wanting to be the mediators of change is laudable. Iâ€™m definitely crossing my fingers and toes for this change.
 
 One of the reasons for this   to have so much buzz is that social media has taken over, and how! There is information available online. If one had an issue with the BBMP, for instance, they had to go on a wild goose chase, because the institution is a headless, soulless entity. But, today, social media can help in getting the required attention. 
 
 Another important factor is that more women need to be encouraged to step out and vote, and also made to understand that their vote counts as well. Women are often made to seem limited in their roles. But if they want to see systemic changes, then more people should talk to women and make them understand that every vote is important. People should begin this from the grassroot level. One could take the onus of educating the people around them, like their domestic helps, and such simple steps go a long way in bringing change a step closer.
