SECUNDERABAD: The L&THyderabad Metro Rail Ltd (HMRL) has defaulted on a payment of `89 lakh to the   (SCB), for using cantonment land for the ongoing project, said   sources on Monday .   is constructing a part of Corridor-II, running between   and  , in this area.

 According to officials of SCB's revenue wing, the deadline for payment of this lease amount expired long ago.“Yet, the leasees have made no effort to clear the dues. Our officials have been making the rounds of HMRL for close to 10 months now,“ said a source in the know of things, adding, “We will wait for another few days and even then if we receive no response from HMRL, we will have to take a decision on the issue in consultation with the top brass at L&T and HMRL.“
 
 Revenue generated from leasing is one of the major income generators for SCB after property tax and water bills, said sources.
 
 In March 2011, the SCB had granted permission to utilise right side of the way between YMCA junction (Ganesh temple) and Jubilee Bus Station (JBS) for   to take up different works including construction of pillars within cantonment limits. It also passed a resolution too in the board meeting to allot 9,800 square metres of land on lease for a total rent of nearly `89 lakh per year for an initial period of 30 years. The lease rent is calculated on the `Standard Tariff Rates' (STR) and it is four times higher than the lease rate levied on leasees for residential purpose.
 
 As part of routine process, SCB has sent a demand notice to L&T-HMRL in August 2016 regarding payment of lease amount, but failed to get any response from them. A second reminder was sent second in February 2017, which yielded the same result.
