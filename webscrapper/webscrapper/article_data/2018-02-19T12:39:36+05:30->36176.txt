PANAJI: The kingdom of heaven is not just about building a relationship with God, but also about building unity in our community through service of our brethren, archbishop Filipe Neri Ferrao said. 

 Delivering the homily at the mass after the walking ‘Kakllutichi Yatra’ (Divine Mercy) pilgrimage to the church of   and St Jude at Gancim, Batim, on Sunday, Ferrao stressed on the importance of standing against injustice and living honestly.
 
 Parishioners from nine parishes — Agassaim, Azossim, Batim, Curca, Goa Velha, Mandur, Neura, Siridão and Talaulim (Santana) — which come under the Goa Velha deanery first arrived at the Our Lady of   church, Batim. They then wended their way up the hill, praying and singing hymns. Here, outside the church, an apparition of Mother Mary had been seen many years back. 
 
 Ferrao also reminded the faithful that the kingdom of God is at hand.
 
 Dean of Goa Velha deanery Fr Roland Carvalho explained how the archbishop had suggested the walking pilgrimage in the spirit of penance during the holy season on Lent. A huge number of devotees participated in the pilgrimage for the deanery’s parishes, which coincided with the first Sunday of Lent.
