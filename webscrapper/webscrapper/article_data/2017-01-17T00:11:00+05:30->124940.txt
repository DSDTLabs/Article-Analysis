Guwahati: For the first time in its history, the Board of Secondary  , Assam, ( ), will digitally evaluate answer scripts of Class X board examinees this year.

 While only the General Mathematics paper will be digitally checked this year, board officials hoped the drive would be extended to other papers in future.
 
 The move will have several advantages. Once answer scripts are digitized, they will no longer be vulnerable to fires or misplacement. Evaluation will become foolproof and the scripts can be digitally preserved for future reference.
 
 “Digital evaluation is a major initiative in Seba’s history. Each and every page of the General Mathematics answer scripts of all candidates this year will be preserved digitally and evaluation will be done on computers, on the scanned scripts,” Seba’s controller of examinations Nayan Jyoti Sarmah told TOI. He added that every evaluator to be engaged in the   evaluation process will have to do their job with utmost sincerity.
 
 About four lakh candidates will take the Class X state board examination this year. General Mathematics is a compulsory subject. Apart from keeping answer scripts secure, the digital evaluation process is also expected to be less time-consuming.
 
 A Seba official, however, added that the exercise to preserve and check scripts online would be an expensive affair and the future of the project would depend largely on government funds. “Manually, 25 to 30 answer scripts can be evaluated per day, but, online, around 40 scripts can be checked daily,” Sarmah said.
 
 The board had also found that many evaluators skipped checking each and every page of answer scripts. This would result in anomalies after declaration of the results and also hurt the future of many students. “In the rest country, too, digital evaluation is a very new thing. It ensures error-free evaluation of answer scripts,” the source added.
