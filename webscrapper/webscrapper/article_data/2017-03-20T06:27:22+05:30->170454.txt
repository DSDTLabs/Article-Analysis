AIZAWL: The state government is yet to appoint a senior advocate to represent 15 students of a nursing school in a case of sexual harassment allegedly committed by the director of the school. 

 The nursing students have complained that the director,  , molested them last September when they appeared before him for a physical check up during the entrance test and interview for admission into the nursing school, said  , one of the two women's rights activists who approached the state commission for women to expedite the appointment of   as counsel for the victims. Colney and  , popularly known as Ruatfela Nu, had also approached the state government regarding this. 
 
 "The students did not come out earlier as many of them thought it was a routine check up for the entrance test," she said, adding that they later realized, after frequent discussions, that what the director did was wrong. 
 
 A case of sexual harassment and insult to the modesty of women was registered at the   police station here and the accused was arrested. The accused was, however, released on bail as the sections of the IPC under which he had been booked were both bailable offences.
 
 Colney said that only 15 students filed an FIR, though over 25 girls had been molested.
 
 A mother of one of the victims said they learned about the incident only last month after their daughters consulted the senior students who, in turn, contacted the parents of the victims. "We met and deliberated upon this a number of times. We were reluctant about approaching the authorities as well since it could affect the careers of our daughters," she said. She added that they finally decided to go ahead and let the victims file FIRs to ensure that such an incident is not repeated.
