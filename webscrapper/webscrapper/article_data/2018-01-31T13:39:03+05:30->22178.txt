PATNA: Electricity connection of around 2.5 lakh consumers in the state were cut over the last four months as per a recent decision of the   and North Bihar Power Distribution Company not to supply power if the energy bill for more than a month remains unpaid.

 State energy department sources said on Tuesday power supply to altogether 2,43,973 consumers were disconnected between October 2017 and January 2018 owing to delay in payment of electricity bills by the consumers.
 
 “The North and South Bihar Power Distribution companies had to take such stringent measures to reduce the Bihar State Power Holding Company Limited’s transmission and distribution losses. We expect that such steps shall compel consumers to pay their monthly electricity bills on time or else they shall face power disconnection,” read a statement issued by the energy department.
 
 The statement said an additional amount of Rs 200 will be required to be paid for re-connection, out of which Rs 100 will be charged as the disconnection fee and Rs 100 as the reconnection fee.
 
 As per a recent order issued by the discoms, one gets 15 days — from the day of issuance of the electricity bill — to make the payment. Another 15 days are given as the notice period. The consumer faces disconnection if s/he fails to pay the bill even during the notice period.
 
 The two discoms have directed their executive engineers to regularly prepare a list of the consumers who fail to pay the bills on time. The electrical engineer and assistant electrical engineer have been asked to expedite the process of disconnection.
 
 If a consumer is found using electricity during surprise inspection despite the disconnection, an FIR would be lodged and penalty imposed.
 
 Power consumers can pay their bills online by visiting www.sbpdcl.co.in (for South Bihar consumers) and www.nbpdcl.co.in (for North Bihar consumers). They can also avail an additional discount of 2.5% by paying the bills in time.
