 “The central security agencies acted swiftly and got in touch with their counterparts in Dubai. Devdiwala, believed to be an aide of underworld don   and his right-hand man Chhota Shakeel, was soon detained. Central agencies are awaiting his deportation,” said a senior ATS official.
 
 Gujarat ATS sources said that to avenge the killings of Muslims in the post-Babri riots in Surat, Dawood Ibrahim and   had planned a series of bombings in the city.
 
 “They also allegedly planned to target local political figures affiliated with right-wing organisations. One of them was a municipal councillor then,” said a senior ATS official.
 
 ATS sources said that at the instance of Dawood and Chota Shakeel, who are also named in the   lodged with the Surat detection of crime branch, Devdiwala allegedly smuggled in 2kg of RDX to be used in serial blasts. “Their plan was leaked at the last moment and eight persons were charged with conspiracy to trigger blasts and carry out killings in Surat. The accused were acquitted by a lower court. The Gujarat government’s appeal is pending in the high court,” an ATS official said.
