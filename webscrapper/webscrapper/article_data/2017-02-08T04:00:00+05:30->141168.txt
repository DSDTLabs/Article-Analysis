Newspapers donated by citizens ensured that 15 girl students from the lesser privileged families stay in school after paying fees for the ongoing academic session. As a part of its initiative to promote education for the girl child, TOI-Times Foundation donated Rs20,925 to help girls from Shri Khushalchand Kanya Vidyalaya.  The donation was made from the proceeds of the Pasti ki Masti campaign that had begun in October 2015 across the city. The distribution was organized in coordination with social worker Gulabsingh Rajput and his daughter Nishita Rajput, who have been working for the cause of educating the girl child. Individual donors, educational institutes and corporate houses had supported the initiative and donated old newspapers handsomely to bring education to every child.
