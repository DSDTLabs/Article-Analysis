 have opposed the proposed move by the Centre to merge Central Institute for Classical Tamil (CICT) in Chennai with  . 

  leader   and CPM state secretary   alleged that the merger proposal was to scuttle research works in the institute and to scale down the importance of the institute. 
 
 The proposal was mooted by Niti Aayog and was recently discussed in the executive council meeting of the varsity. But sources said the proposal was only in the discussion stage.
 
 "The autonomous functioning of CICT would be hit if it was merged with Tiruvarur Central University. The Centre should drop the plan and instead allot more funds for better functioning for CICT in Chennai,'' Ramakrishnan said in a statement.
 
 Ramadoss was more scathing in his attack, stating this was an extension of BJP government's agenda to thrust Sanskrit and Hindi by diluting the significance of other languages. "Though a few more languages were accorded classical status, a research institute was set up only for Tamil,'' Ramadoss recalled. He alleged that right from the day CICT was set up, the Centre meted out a step-motherly treatement compared to other central institutes. For a long time CICT was functioning even without a proper head, he said. CICT set up in 2006, as functioning in Mysuru for two years before shifting to Chennai. CICT was entrusted to carry out research in Tamil and also translate Tamil classics to other languages.
 
 "This is full-fledged autonomous institute of Central government and is qualified to be declared as a university by itself. Construction of building at a cost of 8 crore is underway in Chennai. It's not fair to merge it with another university,'' said Prof K Ramasamy, who was officer - in - charge when it was shifted to Chennai in 2006. 
 
 Tamil scholars associated with CICT said the chief minister is the chairperson of the institute's governing council and hence it is bigger than the university.
