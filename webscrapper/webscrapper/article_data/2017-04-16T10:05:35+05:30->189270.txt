 “I normally wake up around 5 but since I was thirsty I woke up early and found that the door of the store room was open and many items were missing from the wardrobe. I rushed downstairs to see that the door to my tenant’s house was also open,” said Anand Jadon while speaking to TOI. Jadon immediately alerted his family members and informed Banganga police.
 
 As per CCTV footages, thieves roamed in the room for 30 minutes and then fled the scene. The complainant also claimed that all the rooms were found to be locked from outside.
 
 Jadon also has a tenant,   who is posted in   police station, as a constable. “Sanjay is on vacation. His loss would be known only upon his return,” said Jadon.
