The striking range of young composer   is evident when you listen to his songs in ' '. While 'Roke Na Ruke Naina' has that soul-stirring intensity in its soothing melody, 'Aashiq Surrender Hua' could easily be labelled as one of the perkiest, fun numbers of the year so far. And both are remarkably different in their music.

 Talking about it Amaal says, “Aashiq... is my tribute to the 90s David   era. Usually, Dharma Productions doesn’t have this kind of music.” Shabbir Ahmed’s Hinglish lyrics and Amaal’s score has made this quirky, flirty track, a chart-topper. The boyish charm of Amaan’s honest voice was apt for Varun. He says, “Karan Sir (Johar),   ( ) and the team felt that my voice had the vibe they were looking for and suited Badri perfectly.”
 
 For Roke... Amaal got the insuperable  . “I love this song more; it’s very me, and has a universal connect. Anyone can relate to it. I’d always wanted to do a romantic song like this for Dharma. When I made it, I only thought of Arijit and he has done a splendid job. The song has an old-world charm with ghazal-ish words by Kumar and I am happy it is working.”
 
 After 'O Khuda' ('Hero'), 'Aashiq... is the composer-singer’s next song and he will also be heard in his upcoming movie album, 'Noor'.
