NEW DELHI: External Affairs Minister   today said she may still be under treatment after undergoing a kidney operation, but that she won't be well if she takes a break from her job to rest and recover. 

 She was responding to a Twitter user who noted that she's been working hard, and expressed concern for Swaraj's well-being.
 
  
  
 
 Sushma Swaraj, who underwent a kidney transplant last month, is well-known for using social media to connect with, and help citizens in need of her ministry's help.
 
 Even while she was recuperating in the hospital, Swaraj continued to promptly respond to pleas for helping Indians abroad.
 
 Today, Swaraj announced to the nation that two Indians were among the 39 people killed in a terrorist attack that occurred earlier in the day in Istanbul, Turkey. She's been busy helping the relatives of the victims travel to Turkey, by organising visas and co-coordinating with the Indian Ambassador in Turkey, Rahul Kulshreshth.
