Badminton player and 2016 Rio Olympics silver medallist, PV Sindhu received two awards at the Mahindra Scorpio Times of India Sports Awards (TOISA) in Mumbai on Monday. This is her third   award and this year she bagged the trophy of Sportsperson of the Year. For the awards, PV Sindhu was seen shimmering in a burgundy gown by Monisha Jaising.
