If any of our local breweries tries to pass off Indian-made whisky as ‘scotch’ whisky, then they might attract a very serious legal concern. Geographical indications registry (GIR), the agency responsible for administering the laws relating to Geographical Indication of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act of 1999, has granted GI tag ‘scotch’ to Scotch Whiskey Association of Edinburgh, UK. Since 2004, 12 GI tags were registered by foreign organizations or governments in the Indian registry to protect their products.

 The trend started with the embassy of Peru registering Peruvian Pisco, a colourless or yellow/amber-coloured brandy produced in their country, in 2005 with GIR in Chennai. Three years later, Comite Interprofessionnel du Vin de   (Inter-professional Committee of Champagne Wine) from France registered ‘champagne’ in India. The same year,   Vintners Association from the US registered ‘Napa Valley’, another wine of distinguished taste and quality tethered to their region, historically.
 
 Similarly the Italians registered ‘prosciutto di Parma’ (Parma’s ham), ‘parmigiano reggiano’ (Parmesan cheese), ‘prosecco’ (an Italian white wine made from that variety of grapes) and ‘Asiago’ (cheese from Asiago region of Italy).
 
 ‘Tequila’, another famous drink, was protected in India in 2011 by Consejo Regulador Del Tequila, a regulatory body for tequila, from Mexico. A Portuguese organization – Instituto dos Vinhos do   e Porto (Institute of Wine from Douro and Porto) – registered ‘porto’ and ‘douro’, two of their famous varieties, in India in 2010.
