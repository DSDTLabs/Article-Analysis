Mumbai: It is a proud moment for  . The   at IIT-B is among the 36 chosen globally for the international university rover challenge organised by the US-based Mars Society. The competition is slated to be held at the Mars Desert Research Station, Hanksville, Utah, between May 31 and June 2. 

 A rover is a vehicle that moves on any territorial surface for a scientific experiment.
 
 There are four other teams from the country which will take part in the competition-one from Manipal in Karnataka, one from Vellore in Tamil Nadu, SRM University also from Tamil Nadu and IIT-Madras.
 
  Agrim Gupta of the   of India said that the rover recently completed what is known as the 'systems acceptance review'. The big day, said Gupta, was Friday when the team was informed that the rover had been chosen for the global competition.
 
 "We transmitted all the data through a video to the Mars Society in the US which carried out the evaluation," Gupta said. The rover was on display at the Mumbai IIT's TechFest last December.
 
 Compared to a previous rover, one of the major changes made to the current one is that its weight has been drastically reduced. "The earlier one weighed 70 kg, while the current one is between 46 and 47 kg," said Gupta. "With four wheels, it has the capability to operate on rough terrain."
