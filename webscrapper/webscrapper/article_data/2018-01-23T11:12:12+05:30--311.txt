MOTIHARI: Acting on a tip-off, the police seized 982 bottles of Nepali   from two SUVs and two motorcycles bearing   department board at Chhoradano on Sunday evening. 

 The police arrested Ashahab Alam, a constable of customs department, and one Munna Sah. However, one Nagina   managed to escape, a police source said adding it was the first case of liquor smuggling on Indo-Nepal border in which a customs constable was arrested.
 
 Chhoradano police station SHO   said on Monday the police, on a tip-off, reached near the customs office where the cartons of Nepali liquor were unloaded from the vehicles. “The arrested constable of customs department was posted at Chhoradano customs check post. Munna is a local and brother of a police constable,” Singh said, adding both were sent to jail on Monday.
 
 The customs officials confirmed that one of the SUVs bearing the department’s nameplate had been hired on monthly rent. “The smuggling of Nepali liquor to   has become a matter of serious concern for the security agencies, local police, excise and customs department. Night patrolling has also been introduced, but if the department’s people get involved in smuggling then it will be very difficult to check it,” a police official said. 
 
 Deputy commissioner of customs at Raxaul, Santosh Kumar, said he had sent a customs superintendent to Chhoradano office to inquire the case and take details about seizures. “After getting details, I will take serious action against the guilty employees,” he said.
