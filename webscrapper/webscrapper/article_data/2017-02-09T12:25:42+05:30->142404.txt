RANCHI: Urban development minister CP Singh on Wednesday extended the last day for submitting the self-assessment forms (SAF) of property by 15 days. Those who fail to meet the deadline will face a penalty of Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 for residential and commercial properties respectively, Singh said.

 Addressing the media on Wednesday, Singh said, “The date has been extended for public convenience. However, this does not mean that people can relax and delay in submitting the forms. The decision has been made only after watching the eagerness of the people in submitting the forms and paying their taxes.”
 
 Earlier, the last day to submit the SAF was Wednesday. Till Wednesday, Ranchi   collected nearly Rs 16.20 crore and over 80,000 self-assessment forms.
 
 Singh said in case any employee, who is collecting the SAFs, demand extra money it should be brought to his notice immediately. “I will make sure that the person is not just suspended but an FIR is also lodged against him,” Singh said.
 
 In the past two,   collectors have been suspended for charging money from the citizens. Deputy mayor   said, “This decision is in favour of the common people. We are all thankful to the minister for being considerate on the issue.”
