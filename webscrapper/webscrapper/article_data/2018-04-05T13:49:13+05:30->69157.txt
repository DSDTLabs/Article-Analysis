MANGALURU: A day after the Election Commission issued a notice to the management of the Sri Durgaparameshwari Temple Kateel alleging one of their Yakshagana Melas violated the  , the body has withdrawn its notice citing lack of evidence.

 The issue pertains to one of the six Melas, promoted by the temple, allegedly imitating AICC president Rahul Gandhi’s reciting 12th century social reformer Basavanna’s vachana.
 
 Prasanna, returning officer, Moodbidri, told TOI the Election Commission issued the notice after the public complained that the artistes, during a performance, had shown Rahul Gandhi in bad light and that it amounted to violation of the poll code. The video has been widely shared since then.
 
 “Based on complaints that the play was staged in Padumarnadu near Moodbidri on April 1, we issued a notice to the temple management on Tuesday. The management then suspended artiste Poornesh Acharya, who is seen in the video. However, today (Wednesday), we learnt that Acharya imitated Rahul during a play staged in Kerala either on March 24 or March 27. Moreover, there was no evidence to suggest that he or any of the other artistes imitated Rahul during the Padumarnadu show on April 1. Hence, we withdrew the notice,” Prasanna said. The model code of conduct came into force on March 28.
 
 On February 24, addressing the gathering at Athani in Belagavi, Rahul tried reproducing the vachana of Basavanna: Ivanaarava, ivanaarava, ivanaarava endenisadirayya, iva nammava, iva nammava, iva nammavanendenisayya, Koodalasangamadevaa nimma maneya maganendenisayya. However, he ended up reciting the vachana inappropriately.
 
 The   borrowed these errors and used them in one of its sequences in order to up its humour quotient. Artiste Acharya was not available for a comment.
