Mumbai: Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and   Aerospace have unveiled a new   launcher prototype, heralding another attempt to boost the performance of naval warships. 

 The new prototype provides superior firepower compared to the twin canister and has the capability to launch four missiles in a single or salvo (simultaneous) mode. Besides, the quad launcher is suitable for warships which have space constraints to accommodate a vertical launch module. 
 
 The quad launcher, which was unveiled after conducting rigorous trials, will hit production once the Navy confirms an order. In that case, the quad launcher will be ready for deployment on naval ships within 18 months, said Jayant Patil, head of L&T’s defence business. The quad launcher will be manufactured at L&T’s Pune facility. The $17-billion engineering and construction giant has been associated with BrahMos, a joint venture between Defence Research and Development Organisation ( ) and   Mashinostroyenia of Russia, for the development of naval missile programme since 2000. 
 
 L&T has been upping its stake on the country’s defence market after the government announced plans to cut down dependence on foreign military arms that has made India the world’s top importer in the sector. Currently, defence accounts for nearly 4% of L&T’s revenues.
