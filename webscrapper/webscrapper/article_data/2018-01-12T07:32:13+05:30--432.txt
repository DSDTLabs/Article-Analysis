CHENNAI: The state government now has a mobile command and control station to operate and monitor different unmanned aerial systems (UAV) or drones developed for a variety of purposes including disaster relief, surveillance, crowd monitoring and surveying of land. 

  Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday inaugurated the mobile command and control station called Anjas developed by the Centre for Aerospace Research (CASR) of Anna University. 
 
 The command station can be used to operate three kinds of UAVs — fixed wing, quadrotor and tethered — developed by Madras Institute of Technology, under Anna University. The UAVs have already been deployed sucessfully by law enforcement agencies, revenue administrative authorities, forest department and police in TN, Kerala and West Bengal.
 
 The mobile station has a back up so it can be operated for three days even after failure of its telecommunication network and power system. 
 
 Based on the drones developed, another project for photogrammetric mapping towards flood prepardness was sanctioned and is underway in Cuddalore district. 
 
 CASR is working on getting more clients among government departments for use of its drones. The centre has suggested using drones in agriculture, tourism, land survey, mining, quantity survey and infrastructure monitoring. It has also started working on upgrading the design of its UAVs to suit some of these applications.
 
 Higher education minister K P Anbazhagan, higher education secretary Sunil Paliwal, Anna University registrar Ganesan, CASR director K Senthil Kumar also attended the inauguration of the station.
