Industry hearsay is that Dinesh Vijan’s ' ', that travels between two eras, is ‘visually’ inspired in parts by ' ', a Hollywood fantasy war drama. Recently, the trailer was shown to a few industry seniors who applauded the effort with words of praise. One of the seniors who saw the trailer, on condition of anonymity, says, “It’s beautifully done and looks larger-than-life. Sushant (Singh Rajput) and Kriti (Sanon) look great. The eras have been neatly etched out.”

 Not so long ago, we met Sushant, who plays the hero in the romantic drama. When we asked him about the '300'-like look of certain portions of 'Raabta', he told BT, “Ah! You already know it! Yes, there is something like that. We’ve tried our best to make the film look great. There is a part of the film that is set in another era. And there is no reference for that time period. There’s no image. So,we’ve created something of our own. We just hope it resonates with the audience. We’ve put our heart into it.”
