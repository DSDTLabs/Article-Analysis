PATNA: Thanks to sustained public expenditure in the health sector over the last 15 years, infant mortality rate (IMR) and maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Bihar have bettered, and somewhat commensurate with the UN-sponsored millennium development goals (MDG) 2000-15. However, the achievement is still below the national mark.   Sources said the state is now readying to enter the new phase of UN- sponsored sustainable development goals (SDG) 2015-30 to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all in all ages” to which India is also a signatory. The SDG was adopted after the completion of work under the MDG 2000-15.    According to Central Statistical Organisation, the Centre under the MDG targeted to reduce the country’s IMR from 80 deaths (valid for 1990) to 27 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2015. It was estimated to have reached 39 by 2015. Against that, the Bihar figure stood at 42 in 2013, and has continued to hover around it.    Similarly, the country’s MMR of 437 per one lakh live births in 1990 was to be reduced to 109. Against that, the average MMR was 167 in 2011-13, and was estimated to have reached 140 by 2015. The Bihar average of MMR in 2011-13 stood at 208.    Incidentally, Bihar, along with UP, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan contributed 67% of the country’s MMR.    Another positive aspect pertaining to Bihar is that the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel at government and private hospitals has been rising steadily and stands at 53.2% of total births. As a result, life expectancy at birth in the state improved to 65.8 years during the 2006-10 against the national average of 66.1 years.    The per capita expenditure in the medical and public health sectors in Bihar has gone up from Rs 97 in 2005-06 to Rs 147 in 2010-11. It increased to Rs 295 in 2014-15, and was Rs 305 in 2015-16.    However, state finance department sources said, the revenue loss due to demonetisation and prohibition, coupled with the financial burden caused by the Seventh Pay Commission recommendations, will make it difficult to sustain the increased expenditure in the health sector.    The situation will become clear only from the state budget for 2017-18 to be presented in the assembly in February. The ray of hope is that the Centre has agreed to the World Health Organisation’s proposal to increase the health expenditure to 2.5% of the GDP by 2020, which should also benefit Bihar.
