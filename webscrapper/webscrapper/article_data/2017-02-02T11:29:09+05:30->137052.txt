PANAJI: The Congress, NCP and   (GFP) have joined hands to form a united opposition in Siolim to defeat the BJP candidate  . 

 General secretary,   district Congress committee, and Congress and NCP block presidents of Siolim along with sarpanchas joined hands to support GFP candidate   in Siolim.
 
 GFP president Prabhakar Timble, and party spokesperson   said despite Goa Forward being a new party, its victory was guaranteed because of the other parties rallying behind it. The constituency was deprived of development for the past two decades, Milton said.
 
 Palienkar urged people to vote for his party to protect goenkarponn, alleging that the BJP candidate was involved in corruption for the past 18 years. 
 
 Timble said the party, despite being ditched by the Congress, is open to a post -poll alliance. Where special status is concerned, Timble said, it is not easy to get it done at the Centre. Instead the party will enact local laws to protect agricultural land and reserve jobs for locals. He added that a blanket ban is not possible.
