NEW DELHI. After the former Pakistani Prime Minister   made a stunning revelation and confessed to his country’s role in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, the BJP lashed out at   and questioned if the grand old party will apologize for defaming RSS.

  “I want to ask our opponents and the Congress whose senior party leaders had launched a book which claimed that 26/11 attack was an RSS conspiracy. Will they apologise for it now?” asked  , the national spokesperson of the BJP.
 
 In 2010, the then Congress general secretary   had attended the launch of the book 26/11 RSS Ki Saazish? (26/11,An RSS Conspiracy?) in Mumbai. The book was authored by Aziz Burney.
 
  Last week, while speaking to Dawn, Sharif admitted that terrorist organisations were thriving in Pakistan and "non-state actors" were responsible for the series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai on November 26, 2008 which claimed over 160 lives.
 
  “Militant organisations are active. Call them non-state actors, should we allow them to cross the border and kill 150 people in Mumbai?” said Sharif.
 
  Trivedi said that the startling admission from Pakistan came because   government cornered the neighbouring nation on every aspect.
 
  “Whatever was there in Sharif’s mind has come out from his mouth. It shows the immense diplomatic pressure on Pakistan on issue of terrorism & rigorous efforts by Narendra Modi government which has almost cornered Pakistan on every aspect,” he said.
