PATNA: Chief minister (CM)   will launch ‘Gandhi Smriti Yatra’ from Motihari on April 15 to mark the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi’s ‘Champaran satyagraha’ against British rule.

 Mahatma Gandhi had arrived in Motihari (now headquarters of East Champaran district) from Muzaffarpur by train on April 15, 1917.
 
 A Bihar government official said the CM would launch the yatra from a Gandhiji-related place near Motihari on April 15 to mark the arrival of Bapu to the land of Champaran 100 years ago. The yatra will be followed by a series of social, cultural and political programmes based on Gandhiji and his movement for indigo farmers in Champaran.
 
 The official said the state-level function to mark the centenary year of the historic ‘Chamaparan satyagrah’ would begin in Patna on April 10, five days ahead of the proposed Gandhi Smriti Yatra.
 
 The main state level function would be held at the newly built Gyan Bhavan on April 10, the official said. Gandhi had first arrived in Patna on April 10, 1917 to visit Champaran to launch an agitation against the British rule and landlords who had been forcing farmers for cultivation of indigo.
 
 The state information and public relations department, education department, art, culture and youth affairs department and tourism department have been asked to arrange a series of programmes throughout the year for the centenary celebration, the official said.
