NAGPUR: With   winning municipal elections in other parts of the state, ‘Jai Vidarbha’ has now become a forgotten cry in the party circles.

 It is doubtful whether the party will grant statehood to   risking a backlash from rest of the state. Moreover, in spite of regular trading of charges, the alliance with Shiv Sena has not broken down. Shiv Sena is dead against statehood.
 
 Going by region, BJP’s performance in Vidarbha was the best. However, nowhere in the election rallies did BJP leaders talk about a separate Vidarbha. The party leaders may very well reach a conclusion that they can retain Vidarbha without granting statehood.
 
 Vidarbha protagonist Anil Kilor, Jan Manch president, however, feels that statehood to Vidarbha still had a chance. “Shiv Sena had campaigned that if people voted for BJP, then it would create a separate Vidarbha. This did not cut ice with voters. This is because people of rest of Maharashtra are not averse to granting statehood to Vidarbha and BJP leaders should realize this.”
 
 Another Vidarbha protagonist Shriniwas Khandewale strikes a different chord. “I don’t think there is any possibility of BJP granting Vidarbha statehood as long as it is in alliance with Shiv Sena. BJP will think about statehood only if the alliance breaks down completely. Shiv Sena is dead against partition of Maharashtra,” he said.
 
 Slamming the BJP, the economist further said, “BJP always says that a resolution was passed in favour of Vidarbha statehood in its 1997 national executive meet. However, has the party moved even one inch in that direction?”
 
 A BJP leader close to chief minister   said that right now Vidarbha statehood was not on the party’s agenda. “It is too big a ris. We don’t know how people of other regions of the state will react,” he said.
