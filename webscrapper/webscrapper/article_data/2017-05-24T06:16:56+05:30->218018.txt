AHMEDABAD:   vice-chancellor   on Tuesday denied having issued any instruction to the examiners to increase marks in already assessed answersheets in order to improve result of second semester of BCom exams.

 A strong rumour spread across the university campus and commerce colleges that the coordinators have asked the examiners to increase marks of all those students who attained 10-15 marks to 23 marks so that they get 10 grace marks and are declared pass in the tests. 
 
 The instructions allegedly were issued after many of the assessors completed assessment of answersheets and when they came to the authorities to submit the bunch of answersheets.
 
 When the VC was asked about the issue, he said, “No such instruction is issued for increase in marks. Somebody appears to be spreading rumours by using my name.”
 
 In the past, poor result in BCom exams led to student agitations.
