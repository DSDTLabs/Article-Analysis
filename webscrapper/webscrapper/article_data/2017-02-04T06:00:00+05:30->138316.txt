Visakhapatnam: The Telangana government will not take any action against police personnel accused of having links with slain gangster Nayeem based only on photos appearing in the media, said Telangana home minister N Narasimha Reddy.

 Addressing the media in Chinnamushidivada after attending the Vanadurga Yagam at Sri Sarada Peetham on Friday, the minister said, “We have appointed an inquiry committee to probe the alleged links. Once the committee submits its report, we will not spare anybody even if politicians and cops are found guilty.” 
 
 Meanwhile, speaking on Prof Kodandaram’s accusations that the police have been harassing agitators who spoke against the TRS government’s ‘anti-people policies’, minister Narasimha Reddy said, “Kodandaram has joined hands with anti-government forces and is creating hurdles for various irrigation projects. There are no agitations in Telangana and hence there is no question of police harassment.”
