Visakhapatnam: Four students, including three minors, were reportedly taken into custody by PM Palem police on Monday for stealing a car.

 The students reportedly stole several cars in the past to engage in   and joyrides.
 
 This came to light after the students met with an accident with a car that they had stolen on Rushikonda Beach Road four days ago. After nabbing the youths in the car, police were shocked to know that all of them were students including an engineering student studying at a reputed engineering college on the Rushikonda Beach Road and two other students who are pursuing Intermediate. 
 
 The other one is said to be an expert in stealing vehicles.
 
 A group of five students allegedly stole a Volkswagen parked in the cellar of an apartment at Akkayyapalem. They fled with the car when the watchman was not around. 
 
 A student of Gitam college, who was the victimâ€™s neighbour, saw the car being driven on the Beach Road. After coming to know that it was stolen, he immediately informed the police that he saw the car being driven on the Beach Road. 
 
 Police then launched a search for the car. The next day, the accused students were driving the car on the Bhimili beach road when they hit a motorcycle. In an attempt to escape from the spot, they put the car in reverse but in their nervousness, ended up hitting another car. The car then stalled after suffering heavy damage, leaving the youngsters stranded on the road. Four persons were injured in the accident including two bikers and two persons in another car.
 
 After receiving a complaint, Fourth Town police transferred the case to PM Palem police who are now investigating the case. According to sources, the PM Palem cops were surprised after coming to know that the students stole cars for indulging in racing and joyrides. One of the persons in the five-member gang is a habitual offender and an expert at stealing cars and bikes, sources said.
