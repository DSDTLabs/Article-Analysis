KOCHI: Solving the issue of lack of space faced by the   department in the state to an extent, a new   building of the   customs department is set to come up at North End, Willingdon Island.

 The department has received a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the Cochin Port Trust (CPT) to construct a building in the 2.43 acres of land here, customs sources said.
 
 
 The headquarters of Commissionerate of Customs (preventive) will be moved to the new building, which will have space for labs, staff quarters and storage.
 
 Currently, the preventive office is operating from a rented space at Broadway, while the Cochin customs is running from the   building at Willingdon Island.
 
 With the new annex building coming up, all customs formations would become easily accessible to the public. While Customs House, Kochi, has jurisdiction over customs activity in Greater Kochi, the customs preventive has jurisdiction over the rest of the state.
 
 Though the land was exchanged with CPT in 1952, infrastructure projects were held up for want of finalization of land-transfer documents.
 
 Customs commissioner Sumit Kumar said that the annex building is proposed as the Customs House building is over 60 years old where scope of expansion is limited.
 
 “After receiving NOC from CPT, we have approached the district collector for further permission for the construction. The tahsildar of Willingdon Island has been assigned to conduct a survey of the said property. We are expecting a final clearance within a month,” said the commissioner.
 
 “The said plot has buildings, which had remained vacant for years, and they are in bad condition. These would be demolished before the construction of the new building,” the commissioner said.
 
 He added that the department is working towards making it public-friendly.
 
 “The commissioner’s office is open to the public and with the new annex coming close to the Customs House in Island, we will become more accessible,” he said.
