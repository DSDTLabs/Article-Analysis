VIJAYAWADA: Call it a quirky twist or destiny's will, Ayesha Meera's mother   feels sorry for   Babu, who was portrayed as the 'killer' of her daughter in 2007. "Satyam Babu should be paid Rs 1 crore for losing eight years of his precious life in prison. The court's   of Rs 1 lakh is not enough for the poor boy," Begum, a school teacher, told TOI after the verdict. 

 "At a time when I had lost all my faith in getting justice for my daughter, I feel there is a ray of hope for my daughter through this verdict," Begum told TOI over phone from her   residence in Guntur district. Her husband Iqbal Basha, who is also a teacher, chipped in: "Satyam has lost several years of his youth and Rs 1 lakh doesn't compensate for that loss. The government must grant him Rs 1 crore at least."
 
 Begum said they have been telling that Satyam was innocent and that then government and police had misled the court on the investigation. "Our daughter would get justice only when the real culprit goes behind bars. We want CM Chandrababu Naidu to set up a fast-track court and conduct an impartial probe to nail the accused," she said.
 
 Basha reiterated his charge that former minister Koneru Ranga Rao's family members were involved in the rape and murder of his daughter. "We firmly believe that the cops misled the investigation and caused great trauma to Satyam Babu and his family. The case must be reopened and the culprit is given stringent punishment," he said. When contacted, Vijayawada city commissioner of police Gautam Sawang said that he was taken aback by the verdict.
