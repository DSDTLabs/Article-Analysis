THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The national chief commissioner for persons with disabilities   has directed the state government to implement the Supreme Court directive on appointment of persons with disabilities (PWD) in government jobs as per the PWD Act. With legal backing under the   (RPWD) Act-2016 in place, the states would be pulled up and the officials violating rules would face punitive action, said the commissioner who was here on an official visit.

 In reply to a query on the struggle of the disabled in Kerala as they are denied government jobs despite the SC directive which mandates states to implement the reservation roster of 1, 34 and 67 which means that the first vacancy should be reserved for the disabled, then the 34th and 67th, Pandey said that he had met the Kerala chief secretary S M Vijayanand and officials of the social justice department (SJD) and had sought to ensure that the state implements the provisions of the new Act.
 
 “According to the RPWD Act, the states will have to constitute a   (SCC) and will have to work in coordination with the central coordination committee (CCC),“   said.
