LUCKNOW: The   of the   has set aside the ordinance for admission to LU's   which provided for 80 percent seats to its own  . The bench also directed the university to re-frame the ordinance which would be enforced from 2017-18 session.

 The bench directed the university to complete the admission process of the current session which is held up owing to the court's earlier interim direction. It expected that teachers would cooperate to finish the course so that examinations could be held on schedule.
 
 Justice D K Upadhyay passed the above order on a writ petition filed by an LLM aspirant. The petitioner had questioned the validity of the ordinance for admission to LLM course as it provided that 80 percent seats would be filled up from amongst LU law Graduates. The petitioner pleaded that the Supreme Court provided that institutional reservation could be permitted only up to fifty percent .
 
 LU pleaded that national law universities and private universities had adopted a grading system and as such, their students secure more marks in LLB examination, whereas its own students generally secure 70-75 percent marks and hence, they were not in a position to get admission in other universities.
 
 Refuting the arguments of LU, the bench observed, “No study appears to have been conducted by the university before framing the impugned ordinance, neither any such material has been supplied to conclude as to how in the absence of a grading system to evaluate LLB examination is resulting in irreparable disadvantage to   law graduates.“
