MADURAI: It was chief minister   who made the   government which was in the ICU after late chief minister J Jayalalithaa’s death, vibrant enough to participate in the Olympics and win medals. He will continue to act for the welfare of the Tamils said state revenue minister R B   here on Sunday. 

 Addressing party cadres at a meeting organised to discuss the preparations for the party’s protest to be held on April 3 in Madurai, he said that the chief minister assisted by the deputy chief minister   was taking all efforts to put the state on the path of development. It is wrong to state that the government was not taking steps to solve the   issue. It was AIADMK MPs who are continuously making the demand for the CMB in the parliament.
 
 “Many have been asking why the MPs did not resign over the non-constitution of the Cauvery management board, but it is important that they remain in the parliament to pressurise the Centre and implement the   order,” he said.
