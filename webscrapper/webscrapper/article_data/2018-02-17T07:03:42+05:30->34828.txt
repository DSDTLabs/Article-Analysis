KOLKATA: A 32-year-old software engineer was allegedly molested by her co-passenger on the ride between   and Sector V on Friday. The mother of two then dragged the accused, BPO executive Suman Bera, to a police station, complaining that he had inappropriately brushed against her and had kept doing so even after she voiced her uneasiness.

 “When the car crossed Chingrighata, the woman had raised her voice and asked the man to sit properly. The accused had then blamed the woman for maligning him and started an argument. As the car stopped at College More, the man attempted to get out of the car, but the woman held him by the collar and dragged him to the police station,” said a senior officer of Bidhannagar Commissionerate.
 
  
 Police said the woman, who works with a multinational firm in Sector V, wrote in her complaint that the man had tormented her for quite sometime during the journey. She had allegedly asked him to sit properly on multiple occasions before raising her voice.
 
 “She said the man denied having touched her when other co-passengers charged him. He even tried to get off the car before his destination,” the officer added.
 
 Officers of Electronic Complex police station took down the woman’s complaint and arrested the man. Police said Bera is a resident of Parnasree and works with a private firm in Sector V. He will be produced in a   court on Saturday. The cops plan to oppose his bail plea and would seek judicial custody to organise the test identification parade as early as possible.
