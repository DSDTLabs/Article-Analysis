BHUBANESWAR: In an effort to deal with   ups, the   has decided to ban multiple stops by private passenger buses in the city. 

 Transport commissioner   recently wrote a letter, a copy of which is with TOI, to Khurda district collector Niranjan Sahoo asking him to convene a meeting with regional transport authorities of zones one and two here, to implement the ban. 
 
 The proposal to curb multiple stoppages was mooted by the traffic management committee, comprising representatives from the  , commissionerate police, home, transport and works departments. 
 
 The letter said that stage carriages or private passenger buses will not be allowed to stop at multiple places inside Bhubaneswar. "The buses, starting from or terminating at Bhubaneswar, should not be allowed to stop at multiple places to pick up and drop passengers other than Baramunda bus stand and the city bus stand at Master Canteen," the letter read.
 
 Three or four interchange points should be identified from where passengers can be dropped or picked up, from where passengers can travel to different places in the city via city buses, the letter added.
 
 At present, around 100 city buses ply inside Bhubaneswar under the   mode. We propose to strengthen the existing fleet of city buses, a transport official said.
 
 Passengers are upset over the proposed restriction. 
 
 "The proposed ban will be a bane for us. Passengers coming to Bhubaneswar from Puri or Cuttack get down at different stoppages as per convenience. Why shall someone be forced to alight at Baramunda if he or she wants to halt at Rasulgarh or Vani Vihar or Acharya Vihar? Baramunda will be around 15 kilometres from Rasulgarh. There is no logic in the new restriction," said Pradosh Mishra, a daily commuter between Puri and Bhubaneswar.
