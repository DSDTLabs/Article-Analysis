MUMBAI: In a city where 24x7 water supply still remains a pipe dream for many, civic officials busted a   in   and demolished a 50,000 litre   concealed in a slum pocket. Civic officials claimed the local water mafia would sell water for Rs 300 per tanker. 

 The   has decided to recover a   of Rs 56 lakh from those who used the illegal storage tank.
 
 In the first week of February, officials from B ward were on an inspection inside a slum area on Surat Street when they stumbled upon the illegal water storage tank. Assistant municipal commissioner of B ward Udaykumar Shiroorkar said, “Water was being supplied to tankers without BMC permission at Rs 300 a tanker. We demolished the tank and confiscated over 12 illegal water pumps from the area.” 
 
 While the capacity of the water tank was 50,000 litres, civic officials said according to the water supplied to the area daily, it is likely that 5,000 litres would be stored in it daily. Calculating the water charges on 5,000 litres a day, the BMC plans to recover Rs 56 lakh from those who used the tank. “We will ensure that the penalty is recovered,” assured Shiroorkar.
