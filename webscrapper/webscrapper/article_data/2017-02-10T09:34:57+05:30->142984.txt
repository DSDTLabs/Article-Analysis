BHOPAL: New   pharmacy, where generic medicines will be sold at less than half price of branded medicines, will open at   (AIIMS), Bhopal, this month.

 It is expected to sell low-cost, quality generic medicine meant for treating diabetes, cardiac complaints, blood pressure and gastric problems apart from vitamins and antibiotics among others. Prices are expected to be 3 to 14 times lower compared to branded medicines.
 
 It will be another government pharmacy at the premier institute. AMRIT pharmacy, which offers on-demand medicine for generic and prescription-based drugs to patients began operating at the hospital last year. 
 
 AIIMS Bhopal medical superintendent Dr   said Jan Aushadhi shop is aimed at making available quality generic drugs at affordable prices. Jan Aushadhi is part of a campaign initiated by the department of pharmaceuticals under the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers.
 
 Jan Aushdhi shops will be of high standard even though their price would be less than half of branded drugs. Sources said the hospital would also make efforts to educate people in order to dispel a general notion of generic drugs inferior to branded one.
 
 A generic drugs store on the campus would make way for a full-fledged generic drugs pharmacy. The location of the new drug store would be in the hospital building. It has been allocated space next to the AMRIT pharmacy.
 
 Currently, there are five Jan Aushadhi shops in the state. Medicines used for treatment of ailments like gastroenterology diseases, diabetes, respiratory diseases and cardiovascular disease, would be available.
 
 The government has identified around 400 types of drugs based on overall sales and then narrowed down to medicines produced using these drugs. These drugs cover nearly all therapeutic categories. Government officials say over time, more drugs and more medicines will be included in Jan Aushadhi Yojana.
