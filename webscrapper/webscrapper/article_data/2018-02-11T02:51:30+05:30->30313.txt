 Police sources said the girl’s father was a labourer at a factory. She used to study at a government school in northwest Delhi, but had recently dropped out. She was looking for a job when she had met the accused youth.
 
 Based on the complaints by the survivor’s father, a case of abduction has been registered at the Adarsh Nagar police station. Further sections of trafficking, rape and POCSO would be added too, police said.
