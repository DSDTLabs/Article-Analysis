NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court has sought the Centre’s response on whether it is feasible to introduce ‘One Nation-One Education Board’ in the country under which all schools would have a common syllabus. 

 
 Agreeing to hear a plea of   leader  , a bench of Justices   and U U Lalit issued notice to the Centre seeking its response on the feasibility of introducing such a system. The court granted eight weeks’ time for the government to file its response. At the outset, the bench was reluctant to entertain the plea while raising doubt on the enforceability of its order in case it decided in favour of one board for all schools. “It looks very rosy and attractive but it may not be enforceable. We should not pass order which can’t be implemented. You should approach the government,” the bench told the petitioner.
 
 The court, however, agreed to hear the plea after the petitioner insisted that the bench should at least seek response from the government. It also asked additional solicitor general   to assist the court on how to implement and achieve one   for all schools. “Value-based common education system, which includes common syllabus is not only necessary for social and economic equality but also essential to promote fraternity, assuring dignity of the individual and national integration. Many countries have already implemented it. In India too, not only the syllabus and curriculum, even the uniform is common in all Central Schools and   ,” the petitioner said. 
 
 A bench headed by CJI   had dismissed a similar petition in December saying that it was impossible to introduce a common syllabus for all schools in the country.
