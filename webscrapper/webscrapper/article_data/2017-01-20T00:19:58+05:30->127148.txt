NAVI MUMBAI: City and Industrial Development Corporation of Maharashtra Limited ( ) has issued a public announcement stating that no compensation will be given to any new structures that have come up within the 10 acquired gaothan areas of the designated   International   (NMIA).

 “We have noticed that a few illegal structures had come up on the acquired land, as some persons are under the impression that more compensation will be given to them in the rehabilitation package. However, such structures will be removed and no compensation will be given,” said a Cidco official associated with the airport project.
 
 Senior Cidco spokesperson Mohan Ninawe had also issued a press release to this effect earlier this week. “Cidco has already acquired the gaothan land for the airport project and the compensation package deal for the project affected persons ( ) has also been finalized.”
 
 While the total area for the project is 2,268 hectares (ha), the land acquired from the 10   measures 671 ha. Cidco has to rehabilitate around 3,500 families living on this acquired land. 
 
 “The villagers have got the best rehabilitation deal, as they are getting 22.5 per cent of their original land at Pushpak Nagar, a developed site close to the proposed airport. They will also get floor space index of 2 at the new site,” added an official.
 
 NMIA is expected to support the rapidly growing air travel needs of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region and handle 60 million passengers.
