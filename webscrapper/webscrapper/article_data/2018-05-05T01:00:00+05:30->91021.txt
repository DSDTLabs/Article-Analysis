Instead of opting for the usual style of celebrating a milestone wedding anniversary by throwing a bash,   and  , who completed 10 years of marriage on May 3, invited their friends to a gurudwara. The couple organised a 48-hour-long Akhand Path, which was followed by keertan, bhog and langar. The celebration was attended by their industry friends like Sonu Nigam,  , Rajev Paul, Karishma Tanna, Rajeshwari Sachdev and  , among others. Vandana jokes, “Rajesh and I wanted to celebrate our 10th anniversary in a special way. We were pleasantly surprised to see friends, who don’t show up for regular parties, turn up for this one. We fed everybody present. It was a surreal and beautiful feeling.”

 On the professional front, the real-life couple worked together on 'Kya Qusoor Hai Amala Ka?', which was a remake of the hit Turkish show 'Fatmagul'. He was seen as a businessman and Vandana played his screen spouse. That was a special show as the real-life couple was cast together for the first time on the small screen. The show also marked Vandana's comeback to TV after seven years.
