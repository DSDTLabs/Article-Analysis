 After Bal’s FB post started a debate, a few designers approached the   (FDCI) to discuss what can be done to stop plagiarism.  , president,  , says, “We can only work as an enabler. The first initiative or the legal action has to be taken by the designers. We decided to get on board a lawyer who specialises in IPR to assist the designers. Rohit Bal has spent time and money to get copyright on his designs. Like it’s said, once bitten, twice shy. He did not want to take any chances, given the fact that there are so many copies of his previous works. This sets an example for other designers to follow.”
