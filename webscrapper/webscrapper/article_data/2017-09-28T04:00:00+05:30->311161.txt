Present day garbas involve a fancy ambiance decorated with disco lights teamed with modern ‘dodhiya’ steps grooved on ‘jhankaar’ beats — a trend which began around the mid 1980’s onwards,  

 The temple of goddess Bhawani at Bhawani Vad within the walled city area has an interesting local folk lore attached to it. Bhawani Vad area gets its name from a gigantic banyan tree (Vad in Gujarati) that existed there. It is said that in the 1700’s, a tantrik had got three huge banyan and two palm (taad) trees flying in the air to create a ruckus. Had they fallen on the ground, there would have been huge destruction, but a holy man Shiv Dutt Shukla ensured that they landed gently at five different places in Surat, which were then named after the respective trees – Bhavani Vad, Mumbai Vad, Agra Vad , Kshetrapal Taad and Ravan Taad.
 
 “Shiv Dutt Shukla was my ancestor and this story was handed down since ages in the form of a prayer book. It was handwritten way back then and I have a printed version now. Bhawani temple was established with the tree, and when the city of Surat caught fire, this was the spot the fire extinguished by itself, hence Bhawani Ma is known as the city’s protector and Navratri garbas began from here first played out in her praise and spreading out to different sheris in Surat thereafter,” says Amarnath Shukla, who stays close to the temple.
 
 Although the floods of 1962 managed to rot the great Bhawani Vad — whose reference is found in many European travelogues as “a huge great tree, being a very popular place of worship for the baniyas of Surat” — the temple here exists till date and customary garbas are played out beginning with an ode to the goddess first followed by prachin (ancient) and arvachin (contemporary) compositions.
 
 “This temple is also important to south Indians as visiting it is a must in the ritual of guru-shishya (teacher-disciple) tradition from the time of Aadi Shankaracharya,” said Sanjay Choksi, who chronicles Surat’s folklores.
