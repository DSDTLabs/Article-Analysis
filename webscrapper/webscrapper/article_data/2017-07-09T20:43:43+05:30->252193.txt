NEW DELHI: The government on Sunday said the international community must come together in condemning Pakistan's "support and sponsorship" of terror, which was evident in the blatant endorsement of terror outfits and their operatives by 
  .

 "First Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson read from banned LeT's script. Now Pakistan's COAS glorifies  . Pakistan's terror support and sponsorship needs to be condemned by one and all," foreign ministry spokesperson   said in a tweet today.
 
  
  
 Baglay was referring to a tweet from the official Twitter handle of   spokesperson Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor, who said army chief   had reportedly eulogised Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani on July 8, the day he was killed in an encounter with Indian security forces in Kashmir last year.
 
 "Kashmiris have right of self determination. Sacrifices of Burhan Wani and generations against Indian atrocities are a testimony of their resolve," Ghafoor had tweeted quoting Gen Bajwa on Saturday.
 
 Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif too paid tributes to Wani on Saturday and said his death had galvanised Kashmir's movement for self-determination.
 
 "The blood rendered by Burhan Muzaffar Wani has infused a new spirit in the freedom movement. The Kashmiri people are steadfast to take their movement to logical conclusion," Sharif had said.
 
 Earlier, Pakistan's Foreign Office had come out in defence of

 At the recently concluded   Summit in Germany, Prime Minister   had made a strong pitch for action against countries that provide a platform to terror organisations for political ends. Bracketing Pakistan-based terror groups like LeT and JeM with   and al-Qaeda, PM Modi said G20 nations should also "collectively oppose terrorism financing, franchises, safe havens, support and sponsors."
