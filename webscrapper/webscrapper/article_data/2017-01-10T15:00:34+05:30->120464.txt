NEW DELHI: Delhi chief minister   was at his acerbic best this morning as he slammed Prime Minister   for using his mother for political gains.

 Modi tweeted today that he met his mother this morning, that they had breakfast together and that it was "great spending time together."
 
 
  
  
 
 Later, in tweets, Kejriwal said he thinks it's odd the PM finds meeting with his mother remarkable, because Hindu scripture says one should have one's mother and wife living with one. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) founder said his mother lives with him, and he gets her blessings every morning and doesn't tom-tom about it to the whole world.
 
 "Hindu scripture says you should have your mother and your wife staying with you. (PM Modi), your residence is large, now try and expand your heart," Kejriwal tweeted.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Then, in one fell swoop, or in one tweet, the Delhi CM managed to take a swipe at demonetisation as well as the PM's penchant "to use his mother" for political gain.
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 "To serve my political needs, I don't have my mom go and stand in a bank line either," Kejriwal tweeted.
  
 The Delhi CM was referring to a November incident after the PM scrapped Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. Modi's mother, 97-year-old Heeraben was seen visiting a bank in   to exchange Rs 4,500 worth of old currency notes. 
 
 She was shown being taken in a wheelchair, holding what looked like the scrapped Rs 500 notes. With the aid of two people she shuffled toward a bank a counter and signed some forms.
