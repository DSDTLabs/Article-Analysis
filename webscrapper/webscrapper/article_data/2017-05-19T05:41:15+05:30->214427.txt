LUCKNOW: The   student  , barred by the Dr APJ Kalam Technical University for setting  , checking copy and evaluation of the subject he taught in his   course, wrote an email to vice-chancellor Vinay Kumar Pathak requesting to be given a chance to prove that he has been falsely charged.

 Talking to TOI, Ojha said, “I have emailed to the vice-chancellor that paper setting and evaluation was given to me by the examination committee and my guide professors J B Srivasatva and N B Singh. I only followed their directions and was helpless to go against their instructions.” When contacted, Pathak denied receiving any such mail, saying, “I have not received any email from Phd scholar Devesh Ojha. I have checked my inbox several times.”
