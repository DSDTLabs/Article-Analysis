Faizabad : Oldest litigant in the   /Babri Masjid title suit,   (90) breathed his last in Faizabad, early Saturday morning. He had suffered a heart attack late Thursday evening and was admitted to a private hospital in a critical condition. 

 Mahant Bhaskar Das had moved Faizabad civil court of in 1956, claiming the   land was property of Nirmohi Akhara, following which, the Babri Masjid was locked and no prayers were allowed there. Nirmohi Akhara had also sought permission to offer puja of Lord Ram at that place.
 
 Mahant Bhaskar Das’s successor Pujari Ram Das told TOI, “There are two original litigants in this case—Nirmohi Akhara and the Sunni Central Waqf Board. After Nirmohi Akhara moved court in 1956, Sunni Central Waqf Board lodged its claim in 1961 since the Babri Masjid had been in possession of Sunni Muslims till 23/24 December, 1949, when idols were placed inside the masjid.”
 
 There was neither any state or Union minister present at the mahant’s cremation on Saturday, nor any senior BJP or VHP leader of national stature. Mahant Bhaskar Das was head priest of the 200-year-old Hanuman Garhi temple in Faizabad and maintained harmonious relations with the Muslim community of Ayodhya-Faizabad. He was a good friend of Hashim Ansari, the oldest litigant and his opponent in the case, who passed away in July, last year.
 
 “Mahant Bhaskar Das’s death is a blow to communal harmony in Ayodhya-Faizabad twin towns,” said a Muslim leader Captain Afzal Ahmad Khan. Mahant was cremated on the banks of Saryu in   and last rites were performed by his successor Pujari Ram Das.
