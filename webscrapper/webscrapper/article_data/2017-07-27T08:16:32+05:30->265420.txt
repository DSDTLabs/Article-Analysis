KOLHAPUR:  ,000 students enrolled for First Year Junior College (FYJC) in 32 colleges across the city attended their first day in Class XI on Tuesday.

 The students were greeted with welcome lectures and flowers for a new beginning.
 
 “The   concluded on Monday with the   (ATKT) admissions, which received comparatively less response in this session. ATKT forms are still being scrutinised and therefore it is not possible to announce the final numbers now,” said an official from the   (CAP).
 
 ATKT is a special provision which was started in 2009 by the Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE). This provision has got lesser response over the year and according to the officials, less than 100 admissions were claimed this year. 
 
 The figures for CAP admissions on Friday stood at 7,409 that were claimed through the regular students in the four-day long process that started last week. 
 
 Under this provision, students who have failed in less than two subjects in their Secondary school certificate (SSC) examination can take admission in class XI, under the condition that the candidates will clear the board exam either in July (earlier October) or March.
 
 A city based college principal said, “This year, the commerce stream has garnered a good admission rate and it is most likely because of the implementation of GST.”
 
 “The colleges which have vacant seats for the respective streams will get occupied under the management quota soon,” he added.
 
 “It so happens that many students do not get the college of their choice because of high cut-offs or not getting selected in the merit list. Such students can opt admission through management quota, said an SUK official.
