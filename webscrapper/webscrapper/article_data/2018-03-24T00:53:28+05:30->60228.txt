MUMBAI: Scores of commuters, especially office-goers, were shocked when a suburban   missed its scheduled halt at Jogeshwari   on Western Railway on Friday morning.

 The Borivli-Churchgate train sped past   station around 10.40 and halted at Andheri. “This is uncalled for. There were several passengers waiting near the doorway as the station arrived. Some wanted to jump out as the train entered platform 4 at Jogeshwari station but it did not stop. Fortunately, there was no untoward incident,” said a commuter.
 
 WR chief PRO Ravinder Bhakar said the motorman and guard were replaced after the train reached the next station. “We are conducting a departmental inquiry and the motorman will be questioned,” he said.
 
 Sources said a signal passed at danger incident is considered equivalent to an accident and hence the motorman is immediately removed from duty and chargesheeted later. He may face suspension, the sources stated.
 
 The reason behind the motorman skipping the station is unclear. “It left Goregaon around 10.36am and was scheduled to stop at Jogeshwari at 10.40am,” the official said, adding that it raised concerns about passenger safety. There have been some cases of trains overshooting platforms in the Andheri-Borivli section in the past, sources said.
 
 Earlier this month, Central Railway services were delayed by up to 20 minutes during evening peak hours, inconveniencing scores of commuters, as a train overshot a signal close to Thane station.
 
 A few years back, a train overshot Bandra harbour line station by a coach. A WR motorman had reportedly jumped a signal between Churchgate and Marine Lines in 2013. While the train came to a halt automatically (within 100 metres) due to a warning system installed on tracks, the motorman was taken off duty after the incident.
