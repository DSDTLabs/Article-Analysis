ALLAHABAD: While yajnas, holy dips, spiritual discourses and activities continue to attract devotees at the  , pilgrims flock to the ‘Ram Naam Sewa Sansthan’ camp at the mela campus looking for a solution to all their problems – salvation. 

 It is believed that a person can attain salvation by depositing booklets, with Ram’s name written on it in red ink.   Seva Sansthan has been organising a camp on the banks of Ganga for the last 12 years. There are around 80,000 devotees associated with the organisation. Devotees deposit the ‘Ram naam’ booklets after writing Ram’s name all over the them. 
 
 “It doesn’t matter who you are and where you come from, you can be a member of the organisation if you have faith in Ram and are ready to follow rules laid down by the sansthan,” said Ram Naam Seva Sansthan’s head, Gunjan Varshney. 
 
 The organisation offers the booklets to devotees free of cost and maintains a devotee’s account. Every time a person deposits a booklet, it is entered in the account. 
 
 Devotees, irrespective of their caste, gender, religion and even nationality, believe that it is an easy method to seek salvation by writing Ram’s name at least 1.25 lakh times. “We are the ones fascinated by Ram’s name for we know the power hidden in the three-letter word and what it is capable of doing,” said Manju Lata Sharma, who had been depositing the Ram naam booklets for the past several years. She plans to deposit the Ram Nam booklet at this camp after she completes writing the Ram’s name one crore times. 
 
 “Instead of chanting mantras I chose to write the name of Ram as it brings me immense satisfaction. Earlier, I used to worry about every small thing, but now even big problems seem to pass over like a cloud, ever since I started writing Ram’s name,” said Prabhu Dayal, a devotee from Jaunpur.
