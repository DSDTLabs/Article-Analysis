NEW DELHI: Pitching for “time-bound delivery of services”, lieutenant governor   on his first working day met top bureaucrats of the Delhi government, including chief secretary MM Kutty, the commissioners of all three corporations and the NDMC chairman. 

 Assured of full cooperation by Kutty, Baijal also made it clear that work would be done in keeping with the rule book, said sources. He asked the officers to come up with “innovative ideas” and focus on environment and sanitation.
 
 In a statement, the LG’s office said Baijal met all principal secretaries/secretaries/department heads. “The   exhorted the officers to ensure that there is timely delivery of services to the people of Delhi,” it said. “He directed all officers to address their (common people’s) issues promptly. He also assured the officers that   would extend all cooperation to the government in this regard.” The officers were also told to make the city clean and green. 
 
 According to the statement, Kutty assured the LG that the government would “continue to strive to do its best to ensure that public services are provided in a time-bound manner”.
 
 The meeting gains significance considering the ongoing tussle between the Delhi government and the Centre. On Saturday, after taking oath, Baijal was non-committal on his probable ties with the   government. “I don’t know the answer to whether the relationship will improve, how it will improve or why. What I can say is that we will sit together and we will talk,” he had said.
