 Agra: With secondary education officials directing teachers to hold special classes after the 8th period for academically weaker students, teachers have on Friday chalked out a plan and will start the session from Saturday. Education officials held a meeting with principals and teachers of all secondary schools in the city on Thursday and asked them to conduct special classes for class IX students. Schools functioning under the six-hour rule will now have to extend their timings by 40 minutes to accommodate 45 special classes in science, mathematics and English till October 30.  Vinod Rai, district inspector of schools, said, “Students enrolled in class IX have already been assessed on the basic knowledge of these subjects and some students have been asked to stay back for extra classes. The classes will ensure that they know their basics before entering class X.”  This year, 28,379 students will be given extra classes and also Rs 100 each to buy books. Sources said that teachers would be given an added honorarium of Rs 2,000 for the special classes.  Deputy director of secondary education, R P Sharma, said, “We want to decrease the number of failures in board examinations and this approach will prove beneficial.”
