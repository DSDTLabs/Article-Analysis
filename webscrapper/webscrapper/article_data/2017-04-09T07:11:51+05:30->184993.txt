 Another OFDR employee said, “On Friday, Lotekar was working in his section. He gathered the raw material and dumped it into a bin. Suddenly, an explosion took place and Lotekar got caught in the fire. The other employees managed to douse the fire and rushed Lotekar to the in-house clinic. He was later taken to a private hospital.”
 
 A special protective suit prevented the fire from spreading. “Had Lotekar not worn it, he would have suffered severe burns,” said another employee.
