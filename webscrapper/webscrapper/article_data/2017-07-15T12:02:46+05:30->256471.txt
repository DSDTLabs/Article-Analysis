 The procedure, which involves removing and freezing the ovarian tissue and remains in the realm of experiment, yields positive outcomes for nearly four of 10 women who undergo it, the researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in the US discovered. “The procedure is superior to egg freezing as it can also reverse menopause and restore natural fertility,“ said  , who performed the world's first such procedure of this kind in 1999.
 
 To assess the success rate of this procedure, the researchers examined data from 1999 to 2016. The procedure restored reproductive functions and reversed menopause, including menstruation, in nearly two out of three women (63.9%), and restored natural fertility in nearly 62.3%.
