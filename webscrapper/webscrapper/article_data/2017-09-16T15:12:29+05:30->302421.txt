PANAJI: In a fresh circular, the   (DoE) has instructed schools not to rush with completing portion by taking extra classes and burdening students.

 Educational institutions across the state were left in a fix after an earlier circular from the DoE advanced the first term examination/summative examination of the current academic year by seven days so that students could attend the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2017 matches scheduled for October 7, 10 and 13 in Goa. This resulted in a rush to complete the prescribed portion, as teachers realised that there were only 17 working days between the Ganesh Chaturthi and Diwali vacations.
 
 Friday’s circular, however, states that only the portion covered up to the day before the upcoming examination would be included. “If any more clarification is required, institutions may contact the concerned zonal offices of the department,” the letter, issued by education director Gajanan Bhat, reads.
 
 Members of the   (HISTAG) have cautioned the DoE against taking such sudden decisions in the future without taking the HISTAG and other allied associations into confidence.  , treasurer Deelip Dhargalkar and executive member Mauvin Miranda, said such moves could affect the academic prospects of students, as teachers had already begun scrambling to complete the syllabus.
