KS  's Sankranti offering ' ' starring Balakrishna,   and Natasha Doshi released today. The film charts the journey of Narasimha (Balakrishna), a do-gooder on the run with his one year old son. He travels to various places with his infant, looking after him with care and love. When he ends up in Kumbakonam with his child, he's accepted into the village temple's dharma karta's (Murali Mohan) home as one of their own.  's daughter (Natasha Doshi) gets embroiled in a hit and run case, but Narasimha takes the fall for it. 

 The first half of the film introduces Nayanthara as Gowri, his childhood sweetheart. The two grow up together, but now, Gowri is revealed to be married to the new, corrupt ASP of Kumbakonam for unknown reasons. She also seems to hold a dislike for Narasimha now. The film has also introduced Ashutosh Rana as Tota Rami Reddy, a man on death row who holds a grudge for Narasimha. The reason for the same are unknown too. 
 
 So far 'Jai Simha' has been an interesting ride story-wise if one ignores the outdated preachy dialogues and some draggy scenes. The song 'Ammakutti' garnered wolf whistles from the audience, for Balayya's dance and the massy tunes, so did some of the dialogues and action scenes. There's also a massive and surprising cliffhanger right before the interval. 
 Why does Gowri hate Narasimha now? What did Narasimha do to Tota Rami Reddy's son? These and many such questions are left to be answered in the second half.
