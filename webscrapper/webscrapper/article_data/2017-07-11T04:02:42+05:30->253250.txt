MUMBAI: The BEST undertaking has added 2,400 new connections in its existing   base in the past one year, a latest statistics from the undertaking reveal. This comes as a huge boost considering it faces stiff competition from   in the island city. 

 Assistant general manager (power supply)   confirmed the growth in number of consumers. “One of the reasons is the drop in tariff of BEST which is now cheaper than other power utility firms. BEST assures uninterrupted power supply and has a 24x7 operations and maintenance department to fix any outage and provide temporary connection at the earliest.”
 
 Another reason, experts say, was the roll back of TDLR (transport division loss recovery) surcharge in power bills. “After sustained efforts, TDLR was finally withdrawn and the power bills have dropped nearly 15% immediately after the roll back. It also helped us retain old customers,” said BEST panel member  .
 
 The data showed that metering problems had dropped, with 285 less cases of ‘nil consumption meter’ being registered this year. The cable failures too dropped from 1,552 cases to 1,451 cases in a year. The power interruptions dropped by 10% last year while the pre-arranged outages too dipped by 8%, the statistics revealed.
 
 “The arrears recovered so far was Rs 50.57 crore while the balance Rs 46.24 crore was to be recovered of which Rs 18.53 crore was disputed. The number of power theft cases detected in 2016-17 was 2,039 and the amount recovered was 12.5% more than the previous year,” the report stated.
