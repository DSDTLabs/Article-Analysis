Iyer Bhai and wife Babita refuse to play Holi with the rest of the society as they have been invited elsewhere by one of their friends and would head there instead. Everyone starts insisting them to celebrate the festival with them and cancel their personal programme, but Iyer is adamant on going to his friends' place.   says that he is the committee member and should stay back at Gokuldham.
 
  Popatlat says if Iyer and Babita will go out of the society to play Holi, then they would all cancel Holi celebration in Gokuldham. He is backed by Jethalal on the same. Babita asks Iyer if she can celebrate Holi with her friends in the society and he could celebrate it with his friend in the other society, Iyer tells him that it's not okay at all, instead he would also stay back and play Holi with everyone in Gokuldham. Everyone is happy!

  Popatlal gets a call from the marriage bureau regarding a proposal for him. He gets excited and thanks Champaklal for making a wish for his marriage at Holika Dahan. He switches on the Television and sees a reporter telling viewers to be careful about the colours that they use for playing Holi, as they were being mixed with chemicals. She also shows a real life case of a man whose engagement was called off as he went bald after playing with those Holi colours. Popatlal gets scared after watching this.
