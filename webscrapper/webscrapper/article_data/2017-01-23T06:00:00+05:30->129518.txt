JAIPUR: Former US ambassador to India, Robert Blackwill, said that although he was not in favour of Donald Trump as US president, there was no need to think that America has “permanently changed”.

 Speaking at the   ( ) on Sunday, he said there were contractual ties that bind the US and these would ensure a measure of continuity. Besides, Trump’s margin of victory was very narrow, he pointed out, saying that if even 80,000 voters had voted differently, the results might have been different.
 
 Professor Devesh Kapur of the Centre for the   at   said that India did have a huge stake as people of Indian origin (PIO) were the second largest group of immigrants in that country. If the H1B visa regime is hit, it may affect many Indians hoping work in the US. The information technology (IT) sector in India would also be adversely impacted.
 
 Foreign policy analyst C Raja Mohan pointed out that Trump, after all, was a businessman. He comes to statecraft from a different vantage point from earlier presidents. He said that “deal making” is not to be seen as necessarily negative – India too must understand that negotiation was necessary and be ready to enter such arrangements.
 
 Journalist Jyoti Malhotra, who moderated the discussion, attempted to draw comparisons between Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The panelists, however, were wary of making such comparisons and reminded her that it was still too early to begin an assessment of the Trump regime – it was, after all, just the third day of his presidency.
