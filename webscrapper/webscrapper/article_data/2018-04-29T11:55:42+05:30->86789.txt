GUWAHATI: Here's another gem from   Biplab Deb. The 47-year-old leader thinks   can help the government 'build society' if they join civil services because they have the 'knowledge of building things'.

 While addressing a function to mark Civil Services Day at   in Agartala on Saturday, Deb said, "Earlier, people from the arts stream used to become civil servants. Later, doctors and engineers joined the civil services. Civil engineers, not mechanical engineers, should join the civil services. The government needs to build society and civil engineers have knowledge of building things." He made this comment while addressing a function to mark Civil Services Day held at Prajna Bhavan in Agartala.
 
 The CM did not stop at that. He went on to say, "Civil servants should be all-rounders like Sachin Tendulkar and Kapil Dev. People take the names of special players such as Sachin and Kapil. Kapil's bowling was good and so was his batting. This is the age of specialization. All-rounders get high priority."
 
 Deb, however, expressed his regrets for his comment that Diana didn't deserve to become Miss World because she does not represent 'true Indian beauty'.
 
 "I was talking about how clothes made on handlooms in the state can be marketed. If anybody is hurt or feeling defamed, I regret... I respect all women as my mother," he told the media.
 
 While commenting on Diana, he had said Indian beauties should look like 'goddesses Lakshmi and Saraswati' and that only Aishwarya Rai had the looks of an Indian beauty. Before this, he had drawn flak for his comment that internet existed in the 'Mahabharata' period.
