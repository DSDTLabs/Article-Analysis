Bhopal: Amidst reports of reconciliation between UP and MP over sharing of water in the controversial Ken-Betwa river linking project, an anti-project movement is fast gaining momentum in Panna district. The disputed project may become an election issue in Panna during the assembly polls in the state. 

 Opposing the river linking project for “undermining the interests of the backward district of Bundelkhand” , the ‘rajmata’ of Panna has decided to take up cudgels against it. She said, “From Delhi to Bhopal, we will leave no stone unturned to stop the project if Panna’s interests are ignored”. After leading a mashal juloos last night in Panna, the ex-royal said she would create awareness among villagers against the river linking project. Speaking to TOI, Dilhar Kumari said, “The project would be disastrous for the district, particularly for Panna National Park where the most of the tiger habitat will be submerged. Moreover, people of Panna will remain thirsty. The dam will be constructed in Panna, but the district will not get benefits.We must act fast before the construction begins. We will soon start awareness campaign in the district.”
 
 Ankit Sharma, convener of Panna Parivartan evam Vikas Manch, said: “In the next 15 days, we will organise a jan sansad and question MLAs, MP and others over the issue. They must tell the people of Panna about their views”. 
 
 Linking of two rivers that flow through MP and Uttar Pradesh is part of the 30-link projects the Centre has conceived countrywide to meet irrigation, drinking water and electricity needs. With an estimated cost of more than Rs 7,600 crore, diversion of surplus water from Ken basin to water deficit Betwa basin is planned through a 221-km canal to irrigate 6.35 lakh hectare area of drought-prone Bundelkhand region . It is also claimed that it would provide drinking water to over 13 lakh people.
