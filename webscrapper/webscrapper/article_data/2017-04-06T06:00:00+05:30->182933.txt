KOLKATA: In a sting operation spanning several months, Burrbazar police on Tuesday arrested three persons, among them a Delhi resident, for duping a Chennai-based power service provider of Rs 10 lakh. Police, ironically, offered the same bait to trap Rashid, Vikas and Prasant Gupta, which the trio had used themselves.

 According to the July 2016 FIR lodged in Burrabazar police station by 20-year-old firm  , three persons — the MD and   and a meditator — had promised to sell them two generator sets and went off the radar after an advance payment of Rs 10 lakh was made. 
 
 The trio had formed a fictitious Kalpana Industries, where one posed as MD Vijay Singhania, another as GM   and the third person contacted Jaitech. A Howrah-based generator manufacturer was trying to sell two generator sets of nearly the same make and build and the fraudsters took the   representative there and seeing the equipment, Jaitech agreed to the deal.
 
  The trio rented an office space on Rash Behari Avenue for a day, hung a Kalpana Industries board outside and managed to dupe a Jaitech director into signing off on the purchase. Jaitech smelt a rat when the trio couldn’t be reached later on. 
 
 The Burrabazar police then kept tabs on the dead cellphones and a few weeks back, one among them — a Delhi number — was activated. A police source — a woman — gave a missed call to the number and when Rashid called back, he ended up conversing for days with an overtly friendly voice at the other end. He shared with her the numbers of his accomplices and they too called the woman. . 
 
 “The source said she knew a person who wanted to buy generators and the trio fell for it. Rashid was picked up from a planned meeting at a city hotel on Tuesday and the others were arrested based on his interrogation,” said an officer.
