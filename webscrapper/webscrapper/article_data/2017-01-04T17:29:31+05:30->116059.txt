BHOPAL: Taking a cue from 'no toilet, no ticket' policy to control open defecation,   State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has recommended the state government to implement 'no school going children, no ticket' policy for civic body polls including panchayat and municipalities. This would encourage the ticket aspirants to admit their wards in schools. 

 We have observed that often ticket aspirants in panchayat and municipal body elections do not send their children to schools due to ignorance or poor awareness. If the government makes it mandatory they will follow the rule in the interest of their children,'' said Dr Raghvendra Singh, state head of the commission. He said he had written a letter to the state government and chief minister   to include this policy in the interest of children who are not going to schools or are dropouts. This would also improve rural education, he added.
 
 As per census data, 25 lakh children in the age group of 6 to 14 years are out of school.
 
 Officials of the school education department said the recommendations are in the interest of promoting school education however, a decision in the regard is to be taken by the state cabinet.
