 GB Nagar district forest officer H V Girish told TOI that the encroachments came up in the area over a long period of time. “This is now a continuing drive as we want to take back control of all the forest land that has been encroached on. It takes time to get our action approved through the set legal procedure and get notices issued,” Girish said.
 
 According to the forest department, Greater Noida witnesses encroachment because of the premium value of the land.
