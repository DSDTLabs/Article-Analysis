GURUGRAM: Brace up for water shortage this summer as the irrigation department and the development authority have not reached a consensus over the maintenance and repair of NCR canal.

 The maintenance agency for the canal, the irrigation department, had on December 29 invited tenders for the required work. Following this, a company was selected but the work order could not be issued till date as Huda did not release Rs 1.61 crore required for the work. 
 
 An official of the irrigation department revealed that they were directed to carry out the repair and maintenance of the   in February 2017 but the work could not be carried out due to the lack of funds. 
 
 The NCR water canal was constructed 20 years ago and brings   from Sonipat to the   (WTP), that further caters to DLF, Sushant Lok, sectors 43-57 and other nearby colonies in the city. 
 
 “The water canal is not in good shape. Last summer, it was damaged on multiple occasions causing water scarcity in parts of the city,” said a senior Huda official. 
 
 Meanwhile, supply of water to the Basai water treatment plant, which fulfils nearly 70% water requirement of the city, was disrupted last week due to power cuts that lasted for 10-15 hours.
