FAZILKA: Son of SAD MP from Ferozepur Sher Singh Ghubaya, Davinder Singh, who had recently joined the Congress and is likely to be fielded from  , is now facing a controversy over his age. With different documents putting his age at 25 and 25, he either faces threat of being disqualified from   or charges of having misrepresented facts.

 Some Congress leaders have claimed that Davinder’s matriculation certificate mentions his date of birth as July 31, 1993, which would rendered him ineligible to contest the elections as he would be under 25 years of age on February 4 — the date of polls.
 
 A certificate issued by DAV Model School, Sector 15, Chandigarh, also mentions Davinder’s date of birth as July 31, 1993. Besides, his age has been mentioned as 22 years even in the voters’ list issued in 2016.
 
 On the other hand, in  , his date of birth has been mentioned as December 13, 1991.
 
 “There is no ambiguity on this issue as the date of birth given in the municipal records and the entries in the nursing home, where Davinder was born in Jalalabad, will be relied upon. The party has already taken legal opinion on this issue,” said a senior Congress leader requesting anonymity.
 
 When contacted, Davinder said the row was “unnecessary” and accused Congress leaders from Fazilka of raking up the  . “The laws are very clear on this issue. These say that the date mentioned in the hospital and municipal records will be relied in such cases, and the date mentioned in my matriculation certificate will have no relevance,” he said.
 
 Meanwhile, senior Congress Mohinder Rinwa, who had also applied for the party ticket from Fazilka, had apprised the party high command about the issue alleging that Davinder had misguided the party about his age to stake claim on the ticket. Rinwa said it was not merely a question of whether Davinder was eligible to contest, it was also a question of fraudulently giving wrong age for the school records.
