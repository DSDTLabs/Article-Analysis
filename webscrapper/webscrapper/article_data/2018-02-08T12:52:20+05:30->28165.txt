 “When Parmar told us that Jinal was Dhruv’s stepmother and that the couple fought over the stepmotherly treatment meted out to Dhruv by Jinal, we instantly suspected her of the crime and told Parmar to search his house thoroughly,” said police inspector K H Trivedi. 
 
 “While rummaging through the rooms of his house, Parmar stumbled upon a suitcase which was locked. When he asked for its key, Jinal said the key was lost. This aroused Parmar’s suspicion and he broke the lock of the suitcase with a hammer. When the suitcase was opened, he saw the body of Dhruv stuffed inside. Dhruv’s mouth was gagged with a scarf wrapped around his face and neck. Following this discovery, he immediately informed us,” added Trivedi.
