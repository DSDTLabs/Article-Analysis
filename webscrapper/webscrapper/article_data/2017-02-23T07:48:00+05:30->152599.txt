LUDHIANA: In a move likely to give jitters to those who deposited huge amounts of money in their bank accounts after demonetisation, the   has conducted surveys on 17 business establishments in Ludhiana and Moga. 

 As the department’s teams started a survey at two medical stores in Pindi Street, here, the entire market downed its shutters on Wednesday. Police rushed to the spot as some shopkeepers created a ruckus. 
 
 Sources said, “While the owner of one of the stores had deposited Rs 1.5 crore into his bank account, the other deposited Rs 1 crore after November 8.”
 
 The teams swooped down on a wool store in Gajja Jain Colony; an art gallery on Malhar Road and the house of a businessman in Sarabha Nagar, too. 
 
 Similar surveys were conducted at three shops in Moga, including a turban store. 
 
 The I-T department teams, led by principal commissioner of Range 7 Jagtar Singh, on Tuesday, conducted surveys at nine business establishments based in Ludhiana and Samana. These included a leading bus service company, a dry cleaner and a beauty parlour. 
 
 Sources said it would be premature to conclude that they were in possession of black money. “The picture will be clear after an investigation,” an official added.
