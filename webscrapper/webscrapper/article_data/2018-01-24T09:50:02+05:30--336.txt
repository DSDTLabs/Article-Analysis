MOHALI: The city is slowly coming up with new permanent spots of   dumps, the removal of which is a tedious task owing to the absence of supervision from municipal corporation officials. The entrance to the underground market in Sector 17 has been locked for a long time with piles of garbage dumped in front of it.

 The shop owners claimed that the pile is only removed from the spot prior to any official inspection. They said the place is always full of garbage and hardly gets removed by the sanitation team on duty.  , a shopkeeper in Sector 17 said, “We ensure that the waste generated from shops is collected at the common points with the intention to facilitate the sanitation teams. Despite the attempt, garbage heaps can be found in the area, which are never removed.”
 
 Pedestrians and other commuters said they were amazed to see certain spots in the market always flooded with garbage.  , a resident of Sector 18, said, “I pass through the same stretch every day during my evening walks and come across the pile daily.”
 
 The entrance to the underground market has become an eyesore for the people as the spot remains flooded with garbage with none removing it.  , a resident of Sector 22, said, “The garbage keeps stinking all day, which has become a cause of trouble for the house owners.”
 
 The locals demanded that since the passage is locked, the sanitation teams should ensure that garbage is not dumped there while people should restrain themselves from throwing the garbage at public places.
