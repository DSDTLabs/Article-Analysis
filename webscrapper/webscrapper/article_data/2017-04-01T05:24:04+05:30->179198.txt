NEW DELHI:   filed chargesheet against   CM  , his wife Pratibha and some others in a disproportionate assets case on Friday, soon after the Delhi high court refused to quash the FIR and lifted the stay on arrest. The high court dismissed the CM’s claim that the FIR is the result of “political vendetta”, paving the way for proceedings which were stalled following the   Pradesh HC’s October 1, 2015 order that restrained CBI from filing the chargesheet.

 The agency had started a formal probe in the case nearly two years ago against the CM, his wife, Anand Chauhan, an LIC agent, and a few others. After Justice Vipin Sanghi passed the verdict, CBI filed the chargesheet in a special court against nine people, including the 82-year-old Congress member, for abetment, forgery and under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. 
 
 CBI found that Singh, who was questioned by agency sleuths several times in Delhi, had amassed assets worth Rs 10.30 crore, about 192% more than his known sources of income. The chargesheet comes as a big embarrassment for Congress and Singh as Himachal is set to go to assembly polls later this year. The 500-page chargesheet has arrayed around 225 witnesses and 442 documents.
