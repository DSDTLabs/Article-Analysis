Mangaluru: Several measures taken by the city police to streamline traffic have yielded positive results. For, the city has witnessed a 17% reduction in   and 6.5% in non-fatal accidents during 2016 over previous year.

 According to data released by   city police, the number of fatal accidents have decreased from 163 in 2015 to 135 in 2016. Similarly the number of non-fatal accidents have   to 1,037 in 2016 from 1,110 in 2015. While 141 people were killed and 1,253 people sustained injuries in accidents on city roads in 2016, 171 were killed and 1,439 were injured in 2015.
 
 M Chandra Sekhar, city police commissioner, said that the number of accidents in the city have come down due to scientific analysis of accident spots and fixing them. “We identified several accident-prone spots in the city like Mukka Junction, Kulai and Haleyangadi Junction and took remedial measures. This apart, the Friday phone-in-programme, which was started a few months back, too has helped the city police to identify traffic issues and rectify them,” he added.
 
 However, there has been not much change in murder and rape cases reported in 2016. In 2015, as many as 25 murder and 17 cases were reported in the city while they came down by one and two cases respectively in 2016.
 
 Analysis of crime and identification of habitual offenders by police personnel has resulted in registration of 13 cases under Goonda Act in 2016. In 2015, the city police had registered just three cases. 
 
 The data also shows that Kudla police cracked down on drug mafia in a big way. As many as 239 cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act have been booked in 2016 alone, an almost five-fold rise from previous year, which saw just 49 cases registered. 
 
 The police commissioner said this was possible because of increased surveillance on old offenders and series of awareness programmes conducted by cops in schools and colleges. 
 
 Under Copta, police have booked 6,119 cases in 2016 as against 2,711 in 2015.
