VADODARA: A major fire incident was averted when a two-wheeler and a bike were caught in flames at a petrol pump on   on Saturday noon. Petrol pump attendants doused the fire which could have led to a big blast.

 The fire was first sparked in the two-wheeler due to unknown reasons. The rider left his scooter behind and fled from there. The fire then spread to the bike beside it which was being refuelled. The motorcyclist too ran from there to save his life.
 
 However, the petrol pump attendants, using their presence of mind, quickly got fire extinguishers and doused the fire.
