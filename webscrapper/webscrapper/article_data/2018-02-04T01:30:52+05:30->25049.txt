NEW DELHI: For over two days, around 300 students who stay in   are not getting any   at the mess. The   has stopped supplying raw materials over alleged non-payment of dues by the mess warden and cooking has stopped at the hostel, forcing the inmates to search for food at the campus dhabas. 

 Many of the students are especially unhappy as they have already cleared their mess dues. Last April, around 200 of the 348 hostel inmates had their mess privileges withdrawn for non-payment of dues. However, this year, students claim that almost all of them have cleared the dues till December 2017. 
 
 “They could easily pay the supplier. But we have found that the hostel administration hasn’t paid the supplier for months and he had been threatening to   supplies,” said Piyush Jha, who stays in the hostel.
 
 The students have approached the Dean of Students’ Welfare (DSW), Umesh Kadam, and demanded that the vendor be changed. “He often charges us extra for essential items and constantly threatens us. The DSW was also requested to conduct an audit of the mess accounts,” said Jha.
 
 Another student said that until the investigation was over, the Sutlej inmates should be allowed to eat at other hostels. “As the auditing will take time and students are asking for the supplier to be changed, it will be better if students can eat at Ganga and Jhelum.”
 
 Although Kadam claimed that “the matter has been resolved and cooking has resumed at the mess”, students said no food had been cooked. “We face this problem almost every semester,” a student said.
