VADODARA: Gotri police booked historysheeter   for allegedly manhandling a doctor and staff of a private hospital on Race Course Road on Sunday night.

 According to police, Thakor’s relative Rahul Thakkar was admitted to the hospital after being stabbed by Sunil Nair at state transport (ST) canteen near Trident complex on the same evening. Nair was booked for assault at Gorwa police station.
 
 The night supervisor of the hospital told the police in his complaint that after Thakkar was given primary treatment, the surgeon on duty Dr   informed his family members that a surgery will have to be performed on Thakkar which will cost them Rs 1.6 lakh. However, the family members decided to take Thakkar to another hospital.
 
 The hospital management was ready to discharge him but asked the family members to pay Rs 20,000 incurred towards the primary treatment including CT scan. Thakor, who was present there refused to pay the amount and held Chauhan’s collars. Others who were present there with Thakor hurled abuses at the cashier and the night supervisor.
 
 When the night supervisor was trying to call the police, Thakor snatched his phone. It was only after Thakkar was taken to another private hospital, the police was approached.
 
 On the other hand, Thakkar’s uncle told the police that Nair and Thakkar got into altercations since Nair allegedly hurled abuses at him. Later, Nair took out a knife and stabbed Thakkar on his abdomen and hands. No arrests have been made by police in both the cases. Thakor was mired into controversy when he was fired at by former vice-president of BJP’s   of Waghodiya Kalpesh Dalsaniya, outside his house in November 2014. Two years later Thakor’s friend Vinay Pathak had made an attempt to fire at Dalsaniya but had failed.
