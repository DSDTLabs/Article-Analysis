PATNA: The   has sought a sum of Rs 106 crore from the state contingency fund to pay salary of doctors and other employees of government hospitals.

 They have not been paid for last seven months. The situation has come to such a pas that a section of them registers symbolic protests like pen-down strike every now and then. A section of the doctors is working with black bands tied in their arms, reports said.
 
 Joint secretary (health)   said on Wednesday the file pertaining to the allocation of funds to pay salary arrears to government doctors and hospital employees was pending at the level of state health ministry.
 
 “The department last year allocated funds to all districts for salary disbursal. But instead of withdrawing salary, officials cleared their arrears,” Das said and refused to spell out a time frame under which the salary arrears were likely to be paid to the government doctors and hospital employees.
 
 According to sources, doctors as well as grade III and IV employees posted in sadar hospitals,  , sub-divisional hospitals and some   across the state have not been paid their salaries since June 2016. Madhepura and Patna are, however, exceptions in that the doctors and employees posted in the hospitals in the two districts have been paid their salaries till current month. 
 
 “We now find it difficult to take work from the unpaid medical officers and employees. We assign them a work, and pat get the reply, ‘first ensure salary payment’,” rued a health department official preferring anonymity. 
 
 Asked why the arrears were paid first when funds were allocated to districts for salary disbursal, the official said the backlog of arrears was also huge. “The   has allotted the health department only 52% of its budgeted funds,” he said, explaining the financial mess.
