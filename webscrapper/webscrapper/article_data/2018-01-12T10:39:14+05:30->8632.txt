LUCKNOW: Traffic signals will be installed at 12 more crossings of the city in preparation for the Investors’ Summit. These are the spots which have a heavy flow of traffic. But this, as a reality check by TOI found, may not be able to bring the desired relief. The reason being that even after installation of traffic signals, policemen are required to man traffic and there is an acute shortage of those in the city.

 Sample this: There are only 250 cops to man 777 big and small crossings in the city. Around 55 crossings have traffic signals but only 29 are in operation currently. TOI found 3-4 cops managing traffic at each crossing with signals, including Hazratganj, Shakti Bhavan, Lalbati, Vibhutikhand, near high court, Kapoorthala and  .
 
 “At Lalbatti crossing, there is a traffic signal but four cops have been deployed to ensure traffic management because people violate rules,” said a traffic sub-inspector. As per standard operation, four cops are required to maintain proper flow of traffic on a big crossing while two are required for managing small trisections/crossings. So there will a requirement of at least 36 cops at 12 crossings even after installation of signals, they added.
 
 ASP (traffic)   admitted it was difficult to manage city traffic. “But we are taking the help of Home Guards and will be trying to rope more of them in to man these signals as all these spots have heavy traffic,” he said. He also agreed that signals alone cannot discipline the commuters.
 
 “The leading example is of WPL 1090 crossing where last month only signal was erected but still we were forced to deploy Home Guards for its effective functioning,” said Nim.
 
 He added that the traffic from Engineering College crossing across   via   to   crossing is heavy, leading to congestion during peak hours. That is why signals have been planned at Engineering college crossing, Khurramnagar and  , he said.
