 An interactive session was also held after demonstration for elaborative discussion regarding feed and feeding management for higher fish productivity. According to technical co-ordinator of IFFA,  , supplementary fish feed is one of the major input in the fish culture operation and accounts for 60-70 % of the total expenditure. For getting higher benefits from fish farming, a good quality feed should be provided to fish in a compact form like pellets for maximum consumption and minimum wastage. Most of the farmers are following dough feeding practice, in which feed is not fully utilized by the fish. Pelleted feed is one of the method to reduce feed wastage. Further, the farmers were also advised to follow proper feeding management practices in terms of feed formulation, feeding rate and feeding time to reap maximum benefits without any additional nutrient input.
