MUMBAI: A group of imams, clerics and activists have launched a campaign to motivate people in the Muslim pockets to go out and vote during the BMC polls. 

 During a meeting at Raza Academy’s office in Bhendi Bazaar on Wednesday a group of clerics decided that imams would be requested to appeal from the pulpits of mosques during Friday sermons. “Friday sermons are very effective tools to reach out huge Muslim masses. We are requesting the imams to tell the masses about the importance of votes in a democracy and use their votes intelligently,” said Maulana Moin Ashraf Qadri (Moin Mian), head of Grant Road-based Madrassa Jamia Ashrafia Qadria.
 
 Apart from appeals from the mosques, banners, pamphlets and handbills too will be used to create awareness about the need to increase voting percentage among Muslim voters. “It is true that voting percentage is low in areas populated by Muslims. Voting is not just our constitutional right, but should also be seen as a duty. Even the Election Commission issues appeals to people to vote. I am glad the clerics have launched this awareness campaign,” said Mumbadevi MLA Amin Patel. In Ward B, comprising areas like Dongri, J J Hospital, Umarkhadi with sizeable Muslim population, the voter turnout during the last two BMC elections was, 37.39% (2012) and 38.64% (2007). In Ward E which has areas like Mazgaon, Nagpada, Kamathipura, Byculla, Mumbai Central, the turnout was 35.38% (2012) and 44.38% (2007). “Apart from imams in Mumbai, we are writing to the imams in all other cities and towns in Maharashtra where municipal elections are going to be held soon. People need to be persuaded to cast their votes as many use the voting day as a holiday and either go out of town or just sit at home, not taking the exercise seriously. That’s why we have named the campaign ‘come out of homes and vote’,” said Saeed Noorie, general secretary of Raza Academy.
