CHANDIGARH: Thousands of   of   (CHB) and rehabilitation colonies gathered in Sector 47D to discuss their problems with prominent   of all political parties on Sunday.

 They asked the political leaders to help them to apply their force to change the building bylaws. The federation representatives informed the leaders that while there is fresh hope that this time the need-based changes will be regularised, there is an apprehension that hurdles may again arise if old bylaws are not changed. The federation resolved that this campaign will now fully focus on the single goal of getting the bylaws changed. It was decided that after a general house meeting in the coming days, a new date would be declared for the next mega gathering in which at least fifty thousand people will participate.
 
 The residents’ federation representatives however expressed full satisfaction with the results of the ongoing campaign till now, as the annual penalty has been dropped and the process to decide on one-time settlement is underway. A committee to decide on the issue of the need-based changes in such CHB houses have been formed on which the federation has been given representation. Notices have been suspended till the decision on the committee’s recommendations is taken. The federation expressed its appreciation towards the support of the political parties.
 
 The three demands —reduction in board fees, reduction in exorbitant freehold fee and transfer of property to those who have the power of attorney executed before the cut-up date— are being taken up with the advisor. The committee is working on concessions to be granted to those who have made additions or alterations in their houses.
