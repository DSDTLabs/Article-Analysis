HYDERABAD: Two workers died and another suffered injuries after a portion of a compound wall of a demolished manufacturing unit collapsed on them at   in   on Saturday. The deceased were identified as  , 45, and M Chandru, 50. The third worker, U Das, 20, suffered injuries on his head and feet and was rushed to OGH for treatment, where he is believed to be out of danger.

 
 Initial investigations reveal the incident, which took place around noon, occurred when workers were carrying out earth excavating operations in a 1,100 square yard open land (where the unit was earlier located). This weakened the structural stability of the wall. Also, civic officials, who reached the site after the incident, said the load of mud being dumped on other side of the wall (on a site belonging to TSSPDCL) weakened it further. “As foundation of the wall had already been weakened because of digging, it couldn’t bear the burden of the mud dumped next to it. Together, it resulted in the fatal accident,” a   official said, adding the builder, Ramesh, who commissioned the earth-moving activity had no permission to execute the work.
 
 
  
 “The builder, we gather, was planning to construct a commercial structure on the land,” the official added.
 
 
 Soon after getting information about the incident, police reached the spot and found the three men lying at the site. “By the time we got there, only one worker was alive. So, we shifted him to hospital. The bodies of other two were sent for autopsy,” Amberpet inspector SVeeraiah said.
 
 
 The Amberpet police booked a case against land owner Ramesh under Section 304-A (causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). They said the the contractor would also be booked.
