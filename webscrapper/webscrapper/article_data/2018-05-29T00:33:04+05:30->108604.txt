NEW DELHI: The Centre might step in to ensure that work on the much-delayed Phase-IV of Delhi Metro takes off if a decision on the project is not taken by Delhi government, Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri indicated, while flagging off the   of   along with  

 Delhi Metro’s Phase-IV, which has a total length of 104 kms and will cost Rs 55,208 crore, was approved in principle by the Delhi government in January 2017. A final approval and financial commitment is, however, still awaited.
 
 Both the Delhi government and the Centre have an equal stake in Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) and follow a 50:50 equity sharing model.
 
 After flagging off the first train on the 25.6km corridor from   station, Puri said that the central government will take a decision on the delayed Phase-IV project if no decision is taken by the Delhi government. “Implementation of Phase-IV will help the rural belt of Delhi,” Puri said while referring to the project, which will connect the fringes of the capital with its central parts.
 
 Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that a decision on Phase-IV project will be taken soon by Delhi government. He said that the finance department had put objections regarding some of the corridors of the project. “When the proposal comes in front of the cabinet, we will discuss it,” he said.
 
 In March 2018, Kejriwal had said that his government had found some of the proposed corridors of Phase IV ‘financially unviable’.
