TIRUPATI: As hundreds of experts debate at the 104th session of the Indian Science Congress in Tirupati over India's technological and scientific advancement, the people of  ,   CM Chandrababu Naidu's native village, struggle to understand digitisation of banking transactions. 

 There is no ATM or a bank branch in Naravaripalle and a dozen other villages around it. People are forced to travel about 10 km to either Chandragiri or Tirupati in search of a working ATM or change notes, following demonetisation.
 
 Swiping machines are absent too. However, only a ration shop dealer has introduced electronic sale for supply of subsidised rice and other essential commodities.
 
 The nearby ATMs of  , which is two km away from Naravaripalle, have been defunct due to lack of connectivity.
 
 Highlighting demonetisation as a major economic reform, Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday stressed how Andhra Pradesh is racing towards digitisation of economy by boosting cashless transactions. Ironically, the state of his native villagers unfold a different story altogether.
