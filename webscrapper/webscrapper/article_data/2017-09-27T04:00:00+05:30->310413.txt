Surat: Food inspectors of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) will be keeping a close tab on sweets being made in shops during festive season especially during Chandi Padva. It is estimated that nearly 30% of the Ghari (a sweet made out of milk solids and dry fruits) for Chandi Padva is made by shops where there are no quality checks. 

 Dr Aashish Niak, chief medical officer of SMC said, “A large quantity of sweets are made for local distribution. More then business, it is a type of service at lower rates for the people of the community. However, till now there was absolutely no control on how the sweets were prepared. But now, we will make sure good quality sweets are made and distributed.” 
 
 According to an estimate, at least 100 tonne of Ghari is made in Surat during Chandi Padva that falls six days after Dusherra or 14 days before Diwali. Out of this at least 50% is made by SUMUL dairy and at least 25-30% is made by social organizations. 
 
 “For example a social organization run by Modh Vanik Samaj, makes Ghari in large quantity depending upon orders given by families from their community at a common place in city. However, there is no checks on ingredients or hygiene,” said an official from SMC health department. “This year, teams will be deployed at sweet shops, to keep a check on cleanliness, hygiene and even purity of material,” he added. tnn
