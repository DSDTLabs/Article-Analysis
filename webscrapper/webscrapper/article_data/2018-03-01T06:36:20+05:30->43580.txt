MUMBAI: With   being targeted the most around   by miscreants throwing  , security agencies have intensified patrolling.

 A study was conducted of stretches where such incidents were reported last year and additional personnel have been deployed. The biggest concern for authorities is commuters falling off moving trains and losing their life or limb, after being hit by balloons. “We have notified personnel not just in Mumbai but also in Vadodara and Ahmedabad to be on the alert. Certain sections of   are a problem. Not only water balloons, but miscreants are known to hurl trash, eggs or even grease packets on moving trains,” said chief security commissioner, RPF (WR), AK Singh. He added that personnel have been deployed in trains as well on tracks and station areas.
 
  
 
 The   (GRP) have started taking meetings of residents of slum colonies adjacent to the tracks. “Maximum instances of balloon throwing are reported from these slum colonies. Younger residents are warned against indulging in mischief,” said deputy police commissioner (CR) Samadhan Pawar. The police have also alerted informants to keep tabs on men assembling near tracks with water balloons or other liquids packed in plastic. “Commuters who witness someone getting injured due to balloon throwing should dial our helpline (1512) immediately,” said Pawar. In March 2014, Vaishali Damania, 33, was injured above her eye after being hit with a water balloon near Mira Road station. Mumbai police are also not taking any chances and have instructed personnel to make extra rounds as Rangpanchami draws closer. “Depending on the gravity of the injury sustained, an offence will be registered,” said police spokesperson Deepak Devraj.
