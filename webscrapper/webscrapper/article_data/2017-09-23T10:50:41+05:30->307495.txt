NAGPUR: A 27-year-old woman, who had gone to bring a water tanker, died after falling from the tractor attached to the tanker at Santosh Nagar on Thursday.

 The woman fell from the tractor after the driver applied brakes all of a sudden and succumbed due to severe head injuries.
 
 An offence of negligence in driving has been registered at   against the driver of tractor, identified as Sitaram Viramane (25), following a complaint by   (32).
 
 The deceased Sarita Uke, a resident of  , was staying with her husband Prakashmani, 14-month-old daughter Riya and son Pranay (4). 
 
 Prakashmani, a labourer and a resident of the area, said, “The authorities failed to send a water tanker to the locality since the last four days. Locals lodged several complaints but nobody paid attention.”
 
 Accordingly, Sarita and other four women decided to bring a water tanker on their own. Senior PI PY   said the women procured a slip to get a water tanker from OCW, which has given contracts of water supply to private contractors.
 
 “Of the five women, two, including Sarita, were not well. Hence, they told the driver to carry them along. Four women sat on the tractor, while another woman went on somebody else’s bike. The driver applied brakes all of a sudden after seeing a small nullah. Sarita, who probably didn’t hold the vehicle firmly, fell from the tractor and received serious head injuries,” Meshram said.
 
 Sarita was declared brought dead at Mayo hospital. Police have arrested the driver and also confiscated the tractor and tanker. The cops have sent a letter to RTO to verify condition of the vehicle.
