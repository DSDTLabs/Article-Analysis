BATHINDA: The Bathinda district electoral officer (DEO)-cum-deputy commissioner has summoned relevant record in the matter of dual vote of   (AAP) Talwandi Sabo MLA Baljinder Kaur. The DEO sought the record after the Talwandi Sabo electoral registration officer (ERO) observed in his report that she had deliberately made a false statement regarding her vote.

  said he would go through the record before sending it to the   chief electoral officer with his observations. Meanwhile, the MLA has approached the DEO to give her representation in the case.
 
 On February 8, Talwandi Sabo ERO-cum-sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Varinder Singh had given his report to the DEO indicting Baljinder of making false statement about her vote. The inquiry was made after a Bathinda-based RTI activist Harmilap Grewal approached the Election Commission of India accusing Baljinder of having dual votes prepared in 2005 and 2011 respectively. Harmilap said he would wait for the observation of the DEO for future course of action.
