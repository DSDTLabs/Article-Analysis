NEW DELHI: Traffic police have identified six   to conduct an anti-encroachment drive. At a meeting with the task force on decongestion, LG   also asked the traffic police to ensure that the stretch going towards Kashmere Gate from near Old Delhi railway station is eased up. 

 Over 40   on these roads have been identified to remove   for road widening. These would be levelled and relaid with asphalt to finish the potholes. Roads like Vikas Marg, which has been chosen for decongestion, caters to nearly 50,000 vehicles daily. 
 
 
  
 
 Illegal parking on these roads is a major challenge. To ease up roads like New Rohtak Road, police have proposed the removal of some bus stops. The other roads identified are Patel Road (roundabout Pusa to Moti Nagar Chowk), Outer Ring Road (Hanuman Setu to Chandgi Ram Akhara), Sahid Jagat Naryan Marg (Netaji Subhash Place to Madhuban Chowk) and Vikas Marg (ITO Chungi to Karkari Mor).
 
 Baijal also reviewed the traffic congestion around New Delhi and Old Delhi railway stations, and directed traffic police and UTTIPEC to study these roads and find out a way to clear them up. 
 
 Baijal also reviewed the decongestion measures taken on the five pilot corridors of Aurobindo Marg (Aurobindo Marg to Andheria Mor), Mathura Road (Neela Gumbad to Badarpur Flyover), Savitri Flyover (Chirag Dilli Crossing to Savitri Flyover), Dhaula Kuan, (Dhaula Kuan Flyover to GGR Flyover, Sanjay T-Point) and Sardar Patel Marg. 
 
 Police have told the LG that a free left turn on Mahipalpur-Mehrauli Road T-point is being created, and a traffic signal would be shifted by the month-end. They said that stack parking is being developed by the south corporation at Aurobindo Marg and near Adhchini T-point.
