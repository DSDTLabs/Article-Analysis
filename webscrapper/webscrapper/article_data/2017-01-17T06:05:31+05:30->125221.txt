 Eighty six, named after the institution’s house number, the canteen was a hit among students during summer as it was air-conditioned. 
 
 “The moment we received the alert around 6.10am, we immediately dispatched two engines. But by then the fire had already spread and our men cosuld do little,” said a senior fire department official.

 According to firemen, Monday’s fire at the canteen could have been prevented had there been proper equipment. 
 
 “There were no fire alarms and sprinklers inside. Since the fire broke out when there was nobody inside, it would have come in handy in minimising the damage. Also, the materials used for the false ceiling and partitions were combustible,” said the fireman
 
 The fire services department had asked the institute to step up its safety mechanism after the two chemistry laboratories were gutted in October 2010. Monday’s fire was the fifth in Presidency in the past six years.
 
 “A forensic examination will reveal the exact cause of the fire,” added the official. Vice-chancellor Anuradha Lohia said that the fire department and the   will be carrying out separate probes. PWD is responsible for the maintenance of the electrical wiring inside the university. 
 
 “It was a small fire. The damage is mainly to the overhead false ceiling, which is destroyed. We had plans to renovate the canteen after renovating the entire university,” said Lohia.
