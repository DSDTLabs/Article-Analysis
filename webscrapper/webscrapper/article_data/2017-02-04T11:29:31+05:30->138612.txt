VADODARA: The   (VMC) is eyeing an innovative model to fund public transport system in the city. If the civic body has its way, rickety buses cramped with passengers may be a thing of the past.

 A smart city transport system was one of the projects that the VMC had proposed to take up in its proposal for the Smart City Mission. 
 
 The civic body has already started working towards a   at the railway station area that will integrate city bus services, private bus services, railways as well as auto-rickshaws and taxis. It will also provide large space for parking.
 
 Going beyond this, the VMC is eyeing to have four regional transport hubs in each direction in the city for urban mobility. 
 
 The hubs will come up on a   (PPP) mode. These hubs will be fuelling the public transport system in the city.
 
 Besides space for city buses, auto-rickshaws and taxis, the hubs will have complexes for commercial activities. 
 
 The amount gathered from the lease of these hubs will be used for public transport. “The hubs will be the starting and termination points of city buses,” said VMC commissioner Dr  .
 
 The VMC will be handing over the operation of buses to a private operator with a condition that the fleet of buses has to be of state-of-the-art low floor buses. The buses will also have to be replaced periodically.
 
 Another option being examined is that of the developer taking up the transport hub project also operating the city bus services. The developer may make a consortium with a bus operator for the purpose.
 
 VMC is reluctant to operate the city bus services as it would amount to large overheads in terms of recruitment of staff as well as operation and maintenance of buses besides the capital cost of the buses. 
 
 It has already shelved plans for a   as it was found unviable for the city.
