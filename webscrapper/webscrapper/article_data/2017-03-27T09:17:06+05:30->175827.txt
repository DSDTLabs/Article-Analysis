JAIPUR: The state government received a major blow in its efforts to   by setting up urban haats. The central government has rejected the state’s proposal for establishing these haats in two districts.

 Minister of state for textiles   informed   on March 24 that proposal by the state has not been approved by his ministry. Rajasthan government had sought assistance from the Centre for establishing urban haats in Sikar and Alwar.
 
 According to the minister, proposal for Sikar was rejected by the high-level screening committee of the ministry. For   at Alwar, it was observed during inspection that the location was not suitable. “Organization, appointed by the state government, was advised to resubmit the proposal with another suitable location. The revised proposal has not been received yet,” said Tamta.
 
 The question was raised by Bhupendra Yadav, Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan who wanted to know constraints in setting up haats at both the locations.
 
 Even as permission for new haats was not been granted, the existing urban haats in the state too are not well. According to the officials, exhibitors are shying away from participating in the exhibitions organized at these locations. Jaipur and Jodhpur hold regular exhibitions but only a handful of customers show up on a single day.
 
 Earlier in the report released in 2016 ‘Review of Urban Haats’, a   noted that AC Nielsen ORG-MARG had pointed out that the urban haats lacked proper infrastructure, not just in Rajasthan but in other states too.
