MUMBAI: Twenty-two years after he was acquitted of killing his wife, the   has held Satara resident Ramchandra Lokhande guilty of her murder and sentenced him to  . 

 A division bench of Justice Vijaya Tahilramani and Justice Revati Dere directed Lokhande, who is now in his 60s, to surrender before the authorities in 12 weeks' time, failing which the police have been asked to trace him and take him into custody. “On going through the evi dence on record and especially the medical evidence, we are of the opinion that the view of acquittal taken by the sessions judge is a totally perverse view. The evidence on record shows that Nirmala (Lokhande's wife) met a homicidal death and that at the relevant time he and none else had the opportunity to assault and kill her and thereafter to set her on fire,“ said the judges.
 
 Nirmala's body was found at the couple's house on February 28, 1987. Lokhande was ar rested for stabbing her and setting her on fire. He claimed he was falsely implicated in the case and that his wife had committed suicide by stabbing and setting herself on fire. The sessions court in 1995 accepted his con tention and acquit ted him. Earlier this month, the state's appeal against the conviction came up for hearing. The HC cited the evidence of the doctor and the   which showed that the cause of Nirmala's death was the stab wound. Based on the post mortem report the HC concluded that Lokhande had first stabbed her to death when she was asleep and hours later set her body on fire to destroy evidence. The HC noted that the police had not recovered the blood stained knife. “If Lokhande's story was true, a blood stained knife would be found in the house,“ said the judges, adding, “It is not possible that Nirmala would have stabbed herself, would have washed the knife, kept it in place and thereafter set herself on fire. Such a sequence of events is just not possible and it is totally unthinkable.“
