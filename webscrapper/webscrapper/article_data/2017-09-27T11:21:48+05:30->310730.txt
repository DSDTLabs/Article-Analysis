It is not just the FBI and CIA which are struggling with  . In UP, probe into the mysterious death of a first-year MBBS student in Bareilly hit a roadblock after Hyderabad's forensic laboratory recently returned the locked   7 of Ananya Dixit to investigators.

 Experts at CFSL said it was difficult for them to extract data from it. This was the third time that 17-year-old Ananya's cellphone was sent back by forensic experts.
 
 Her body was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her hostel room on September 6. The only daughter of a senior manager in a prominent business house and a resident of Noida, Ananya had joined Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences in Bareilly in August.
 
 Her parents had alleged anomalies in police probe and did not buy the suicide theory .
 
 “Bareilly police ignored circumstantial evidence and have been trying to scuttle the probe under the pretext of examining Ananya's phone. College authorities acted in a negligent manner,“ said Anadi Dixit, her father.
 
 SP Bareilly rural Khyati Garg, who is supervising the probe, said, “It is impossible to crack the iPhone. Moradabad and Lucknow forensic laboratories and even the central lab in Hyderabad returned the phone after failing to crack the code,“ said Garg.
 
 Through call detail records, police identified two persons in touch with Ananya. They will be questioned.
