MUMBAI: Two days after the family of late   MP from Palghar, Chintaman Wanga, joined the  , chief minister   said that his party had decided to give the ticket to a family member for the  . The CM said he had also informed Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray about the decision. 

  Fadnavis said that he spoke to Uddhav last month saying they had finalized Wanga's son's name for the bypoll and that the Sena should help them. "Thackeray told me that the Sena does not contest bypolls and that he would ask Subhash Desai (Sena leader and cabinet minister) to talk to me about this. Desai also spoke to me on May 1 and the next I know on May 3, Wanga's kin joined Sena," said Fadnavis. Wanga passed away after a heart attack in January, his demise has necessitated the by-election. "We have a lot of respect for Chintaman Wanga as he helped the party increase its reach in Palghar. We only hope that his family members do not do anything which will be a loss to the his contribution to BJP," said Fadnavis on Saturday. 
 
  When asked that Wanga's son Srinivas had said that his family was trying to reach Fadnavis since 15 days before they joined Sena, but were not getting any response, Fadnavis, said, "There was some miscommunication." 
 
  "When I received their message saying that they wanted to meet me, I told them to come to my office. I asked my office to give them an appointment. And then all I get to know was that they have joined Sena," said Fadnavis. Fadnavis said that Wangas' accusation that the were sidelined by the local BJP unit was not true.
