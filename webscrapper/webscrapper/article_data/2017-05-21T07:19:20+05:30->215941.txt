 He served on the boards of several leading Indian companies as well as the Reserve Bank of India, and was president of the Bengal Chamber and the Associated Chambers of Commerce (Assocham) at a time when they enjoyed considerable heft.
 
 Mitter was educated at St. Xavier’s School and Cambridge University and qualified as a Barrister from Lincoln’s Inn in London. Instead of practising law, he joined   in 1947, and about 20 years on, rose to head it.
 
 He was a founder trustee of the Unit Trust of India when it was launched in 1964. An early proponent of modern management education, he was associated with the Indian Institute of Management in Kolkata.
 
 A man of diverse interests, Mitter was a keen gardener and was involved with many voluntary conservation efforts in the city. He was an authority on the local history of Kolkata and its environs, and travelled extensively around Bengal. He also supported numerous philanthropic activities through such organisations as the Ramakrishna Mission and the Rotary Club.
 
 He was known to a wide section of Kolkata society and was elected president of Bengal Club and Calcutta Club. He had a special interest in music, particularly Rabindra Sangeet. An avid sports lover, he was associated with Mohun Bagan Club for many years and was an enthusiastic supporter at cricket Test matches at Eden Gardens. In his younger days, he played tennis with proficiency and won the Bengal Junior Doubles.
 
 Those who knew Mitter well will testify to the fact that he could tell a story with great verve and humour — a quality he retained well into his 90s. His was a life well-spent; his only regret, had he been in a position to articulate it, might have been: “Jah, century-ta miss hoye galo.”
