MADURAI: The Kanyakumari collector and the chief engineer of the   have been directed to remove encroachments on   connecting Kerala with the Kanyakumari district after conducting a survey. A division bench headed by   was hearing a public interest litigation filed by  , secretary of the  , a voluntary organisation. 

 The PIL said that the 125 feet wide highway has shrunk into 80 feet at many places. "Tourists from Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, besides Tamil Nadu, go to Kanyakumari through NH 47. But, the easy flow of traffic has been affected due to encroachments," the petitioner's counsel said. "The national highway department, which is supposed to maintain the highway, has turned a blind eye to it. Due to it, many influential people have encroached on the highway land and have constructed buildings. Besides, the district authority has created revenue documents to the encroachments by giving pattas. The revenue department is not supposed to issue patta to the lands encroached," the counsel said. 
 
 "If the authority does not take action on the encroachments, the highway will disappear from the map. Though the association gave many representations to the officers concerned, including the collector and the chief engineer of the public works department since 2013, no action was taken," the counsel alleged.
