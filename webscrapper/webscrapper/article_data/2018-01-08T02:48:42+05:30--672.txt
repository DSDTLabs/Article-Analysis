NEW DELHI: A senior   (IIS) officer’s car was waylaid by three men and a woman near the embassy of Hungary in   on Friday night. The road rage case lasted around 15 minutes in which the accused not only misbehaved with the officer’s driver, but also kept her confined to the car.

 Confirming the incident, senior police officers said that a case of wrongful restraint has been registered against the unknown accused at Chanakyapuri police station. Efforts are on to track them down.
 
 Initial probe has revealed that the incident occurred around 8pm on Niti Marg. The officer’s car was overtaken near a roundabout by another vehicle. The occupants of the other vehicle, which included three men and a woman, had been shouting from their car asking the driver of the senior bureaucrat to stop.
 
 When the driver stopped, they surrounded the car and started hitting the windowpanes asking him to step out. The driver told police that the accused threatened to “teach him a lesson” for not giving them space to overtake.
 
 In the meantime, the bureaucrat called the PCR. This further agitated the accused group and they continued to harass the driver. They didn’t give the car space to move from there. When the officer called the cops again, the group sped away fearing they would be arrested.
 
 Police said the car of the accused had a Delhi registration number with 2710 as the last four digits. CCTV footage from the area is being scanned to ascertain the identity of the accused and the make of their vehicle.
