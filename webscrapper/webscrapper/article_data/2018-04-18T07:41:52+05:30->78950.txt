NAGPUR: When the   from Hyderabad landed in Nagpur on Tuesday evening, a few passengers were shocked to learn that their luggage was not on board.

 An IndiGo spokesperson confirmed the development saying the luggage was taken off because additional fuel was filled in anticipation of bad weather enroute. 20 pieces of bags were held back at Hyderabad airport to accommodate the changes.
 
 “Due to expected weather enroute, the pilot had to uplift additional fuel which resulted in a reduced payload. The staff had pro-actively informed the affected passengers about the situation and assured that their respective baggages will be transported via an alternate flight at the earliest,” the IndiGo spokesperson told TOI. 
 
 Passengers, however, were livid saying that they were informed about this only after landing at Nagpur and it resulted in major inconvenience.
 
 Deepak Mishra, a lawyer, was supposed to proceed immediately towards   (about 280km from here) for a court proceeding. “My lawyer’s gown was in that baggage and now I am stuck. IndiGo has assured me that I will get everything by noon on Wednesday but I am a bit sceptical,” said Mishra.
 
 The IndiGo ground staff at   told the affected passengers that their baggages will arrive by the morning flight on Wednesday. Ishita Khare, a student, said, “It’s a major inconvenience because a lot of important things are kept in the checked in baggage.”
 
 Arvind Joshi’s wife was also one of the affected passengers. “They should have at least informed us about it before we departed. People have come here to attend official and social events,” said Joshi.
