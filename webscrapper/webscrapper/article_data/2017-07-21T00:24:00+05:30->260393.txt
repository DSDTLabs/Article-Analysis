Pune: Planning to buy a property in the 23   slated for   in the PMC limits? Better check all the legal documents of the housing project before investing.

 Booming illegal constructions in the fringe villages slated for merger in the PMC limits have caught the attention of the civic authorities. Though Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has no direct role to play in the   activities in these villages, it has told the state government that the Pune Metropolitan Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) will keep a tab on the construction activity in the area.
 
 “The responsibility of controlling illegal constructions in these areas lies with the PMRDA,” PMC city engineer Prashant Waghmare told TOI. The PMC has clarified that it will not regularize illegal constructions in these villages once they are merged in the civic limits. 
 
 PMRDA officials said the authority has already readied an action plan against illegal constructions and was keeping a close watch on construction activity in areas under its jurisdiction. As per the PMRDA, there are a total of 18,000 illegal structures in areas under its limits.
 
 “Work is in progress to check how many of these structures can be regularized,” PMRDA officials said, adding that they have also started conducting a survey of such structures. A private agency has been appointed for the demolition drive. The agency is to be paid Rs 570/sqm, with the amount to be reclaimed from the building's owner, they said.
 
 The state assembly recently amended the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, which allows legalization of unauthorized constructions by paying a premium or a compounding fee. 
 
 The new rule will be applicable to structures built before December 2015. However, players in illegal construction market are confident that there will be more deadlines in coming years
