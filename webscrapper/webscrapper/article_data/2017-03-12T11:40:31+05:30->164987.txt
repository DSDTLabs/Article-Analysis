 Astute ticket distribution to non-Yadav backwards were given more than 130 nominations.

 
  Targeting of non-Jatav Dalits, with Pasis getting 25 tickets and Dhobis cornering nine. This amplified the signal given by Shah's earlier decision to appoint Keshav Maurya, a Kushwaha, as state party president.
 
 
  Induction of other backwards and non-Jatav dalits in the central ministry like Krishna Raj, Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti and Apna Dal's  .
 
 
 Poaching of influential BSP members like Swami Prasad Maurya and R K Chaudhary. This made BSP look like a party of Jatavs alone. The same tactic was used to highlight  's dependence on Yadavs.
 
 
  used demonetisation and surgical strikes to project PM Modi as a leader capable of taking decisive action and pro-poor measures.
 
 
 Speedy implementation of welfare schemes like Ujjwala, subsidy for toilets, and better supply of urea. Promises of more populist measures like farm loan waiver and interest-free loans were a hit.
 
 
  Stoked resentment against  's perceived tilt towards Muslims and Yadavs and benefited from a backlash. Modi and Shah promised end of "discrimination" in "rozgar and FIR".
 
 
  A not-so-subtle messaging to Hindus through promises to shut down mechanised abbatoirs and set up anti-Romeo squads.
 
 
  Denial of any tickets to Muslims helped it present itself as a Hindu party "correcting" its rivals' politics of "appeasement".
 
 
 BJP did not project a chief minister as it had no leader to match either Akhilesh or Mayawati. Any choice would have led to caste rivalries and unravelled the coalition. Focus remained on Modi who trumped rivals. Modi's interventions, BJP feels, boosted its prospects in 50 marginal seats.
