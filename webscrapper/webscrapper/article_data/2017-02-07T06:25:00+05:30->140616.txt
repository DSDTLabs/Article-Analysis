Noida: The busy Sector 18 market witnessed a   of over 20 hours on Monday after an 11kV feed-er broke down due to digging by private contractors hired by the Noida Authority. 

 The power cable of the feeder was damaged in at least two places in the wee hours of Sunday due to the digging, cutting off power supply to D, F, K and N blocks of the sector. Although it had been expected to be repaired by 5pm, PVVNL junior engineer Bhupendra Kumar Gangal, who is in charge of the area, said repair work was likely to continue till late evening. “The Authority is carrying out beautification work in Sector 18. The 11kV line has been damaged at many points. We are trying to fix the problem,” he said.
 
 “We had no power when the market opened at around 9am. We were told that the 11kV feeder number 6 was damaged around 1am, which has affected supply in most of the sector especially blocks D-1 and D-2, F, K and N, and that there was no alternative source of supply for this area,” said S K Jain, president of Sector 18 market association.
 
 He said necessary steps should be taken to avoid such outages in the future. “This is not the first time that the underground cables have been damaged. Being a busy commercial area, such long outages create immense problems in running our daily business,” Jain added.
 
 When contacted, PVVNL superintending engineer Mukul Singhal said that the Noida Authority had carried out some digging work in the area without informing them. “Normally, we get an intimation on any external or internal work carried out by the Authority. But in this case, the private contractor hired by the authority did not inform us of any work in progress,” Singhal told TOI.
