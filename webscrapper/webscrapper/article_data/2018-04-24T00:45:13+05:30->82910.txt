Around 140 differently-abled people from 16 teams across the state took part in the one-day tournament held in connection with the 65th birthday celebration of DMK working president M K Stalin.

Tirunelveli wrested the upper-hand in the second set scoring 25 against Coimbatore’s 18. However, the champions made a comeback by beating the home side 25-18 in the third and final set. Kanyakumari beat Tuticorin 30-14 in the clash for the third place. Cash prizes of Rs 65,000, Rs, 33,000 and Rs 11,000 were given away in that order to champions, second and third places.  The tournament was earlier planned to be conducted at the VOC ground in Palayamkottai but had to be rescheduled after permission was denied to them. S Subramanian, DMK Youth Wing, Tirunelveli East District, said that they had applied for permission for the event on March 5 and was given the clearance on the April 12. “We paid the ground rent of Rs 10,304 to Tirunelveli Corporation on April 13,” he said. The district administration cited that Tirunelveli Corporation had passed a resolution in its council meeting more than 15 years ago that the ground should not be given on rent to any political party for a political event. Officials cited installation of party flags by the DMK all over the ground and the road as reason for denial of permission.
