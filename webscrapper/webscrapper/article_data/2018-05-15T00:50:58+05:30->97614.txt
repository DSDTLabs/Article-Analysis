New Delhi: Some mediapersons   spoke to hours before her death were questioned by SIT in January 2015. Senior journalist  , who was the last person Pushkar had reportedly spoken to, recalled that the latter was upset over a lot of things. 

 “She was slurring and was really disturbed about the Mehr Tarar and   issues. I had asked her if she had dinner, to which she didn’t say anything. I had assured her that she was a wonderful woman, but she was clearly upset. I don’t remember what she was saying, but she had referred to the IPL mess a few times,” Singh said. 
 
 She said it was clear that Pushkar was distraught, but it would be difficult to say if that led her to commit suicide. “It will be a long-drawn battle in court for Tharoor and  ,” she said. 
 
 “She had called me around midnight. She was talking about the reported fight between her and Tharoor. I tried to console her, saying she was imagining a lot (of things). She was refusing to answer some of the questions about her health ...,” Singh said in her statement recorded before a magistrate. 
 
 Hours before her death, Pushkar had also spoken to journalist Barkha Dutt, who had told investigators that she had alleged that her husband was having an affair with Pakistani journalist Mehr Tarar and that she had moved out of Tharoor’s official residence into Leela Hotel because of this. Sunanda claimed that she had “taken the flak for him in IPL,” Dutt told cops in her statement.
 
 Pushkar had also called journalist Rahul Kanwal, saying she wanted to give an interview on certain undisclosed matters.
