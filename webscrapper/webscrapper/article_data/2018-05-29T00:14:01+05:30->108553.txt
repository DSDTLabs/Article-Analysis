Pune: Over 1,000 block level officials ( ) have come under the scanner for not reporting for the door-to-door voter enrolment drive, which began on May 15.

 Nearly 7,534 BLOs were supposed to be on duty for enrolment drive in Pune district. However, 1,132 officials did not report for it, district election officials said, adding that these officials will be issued notices for their absence.
 
 “They are bound to face action under the Representation of the People Act, 1951. There could be a department inquiry against them that could even lead to their suspension,” deputy election officer Monica Singh told TOI.
 
 The Election Commission of India had issued directions to have the BLOs conduct the door-to-door survey to ensure that no voter was left out from the voters’ list. “I have already spoken to both PMC and PCMC commissioners and necessary action will be initiated if the BLOs do not report to work,” Pune district collector Naval Kishore Ram said.
