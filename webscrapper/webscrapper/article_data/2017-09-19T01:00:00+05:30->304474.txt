If you think filmmaking is a cumbersome process, wait till you know what the makers of ' ' went through. Headlined by  , Pankaj Tripathi, Raghubir Yadav and Anjali Patil, the dark comedy, also presented by  , was originally expected to be shot in  . However, since they didn’t get permission from the forest department, the team relocated to Dalli Rajhara, a jungle in  , which is vulnerable to   attacks. With no access to mobile network for weeks, it became difficult for the team to stay in touch with their families.
The cast and crew reached the locations sans security since the locals had advised them to avoid seeking undue attention. Even the actors playing CRPF   were asked not to travel in their get-up, which could have created trouble. Director-writer Amit V Masurkar says, “When we were shooting in the middle of the jungle, a police party ordered us to leave immediately. Within 15 minutes, our 150-strong unit packed off in 35 vehicles in pin-drop silence. We went to shoot there a couple of days later, but never found out what had happened.”
 However, the risk seems to have paid off as the film’s makers are happy with the response to the trailer that was launched a few days ago. 
 'Newton', presented by Eros International, produced by Drishyam Films in association with Colour Yellow Productions, releases on September 22.
