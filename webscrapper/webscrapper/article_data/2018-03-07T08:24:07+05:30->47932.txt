 According to police, on Monday, Aditya left for school at 7am but when he did not return till 12pm, his mother called Dharmrajsinh who was out of station. He called up the school principal who claimed that he was yet to pay Rs 600 as fees. Dharmrajsinh tried to convince the principal to let his son go as he was out of town and it was not possible for him to come and pay the fees. He assured that he would pay the fees on Tuesday. But the principal did not relent. 
 
 So, Dharmarajsinh called the police control room for help. When police reached there it found that nearly 160 students were held up by the school authorities over non-payment of fees. However, the students were released later. On Tuesday, Dharmrajsinh lodged a complaint with the DEO who has asked his education inspector to conduct a probe.
