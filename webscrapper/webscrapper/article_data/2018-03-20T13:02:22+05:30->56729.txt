ZIRAKPUR: It is almost after a year of pain that   breathed a sigh of relief after a team of sweepers cleaned up the heap of garbage dumped outside his IT firm in Mohali. 

 He had complained about his woes to the Mohali municipal corporation ( ) and even posted a picture on Swachh Bharat Abhiyan app. However, no action was taken on it. However, after TOI reported about the issue on March 12, 2018, sweepers cleaned up the illegal dumping site at 1754, Phase VII, Industrial Area, Sector 73, SAS Nagar. TOI also reported that the status of the issue was changed to ‘resolved’ on Swachhta app without cleaning the site.
 
 Vivek, the owner of an IT firm in Mohali, said the garbage was disposed of by sweepers from past more than a year. He posted those pictures on the app with a hope that the issue would be resolved soon. However nothing happened till the issue was reported by TOI on March 12, 2018. It is on that morning that a team of sweepers turned up with their collection vehicle and cleaned the site in three hours. After cleaning the site, they also made a call to Vivek to know if he was satisfied with their work or not.
 
 Another issue, which the TOI had highlighted, was of garbage disposal on old Ambala–Kalka road, about which  , a resident, was complaining for past six months. Both sides of the road had become a garbage dump but nothing was done by the authorities. The council has recently installed dustbins in the area.
 
 Manbir Gill, executive officer of   municipal council, said, going by the policy of the Central government, the MC will soon install more such bins in the area soon. In fact, he said that after TOI reported the issue that the officials are putting up wrong status about cleaning on the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan app, he instructed all the concerned officials to put up the pictures on the app, showing that the places have been cleaned and then, change the status to ‘resolved’.
