KANYAKUMARI: From over 26,000 hectares to a mere 6,000 hectares. That, in short, is the alarming state of paddy cultivation in Kanyakumari district. Gone are the green carpets of paddy fields which characterised the stretch from   to Thovalai and from   to Parvathypuram as well as vast areas in   and Agastheeswaram taluks.

 Urbanisation, crop conversion and improper maintenance of tanks resulting in inadequate water supply coupled with high cost of labour and labour shortage are cited as reasons for the drastic dip in agriculture in this once green district. 
 
 Statistics with the agriculture department show that areas under rubber, coconut and banana cultivation is much more than paddy.
 
 “It used to be 52,000 hectares in the early 1950s when the district was part of Travancore, when paddy was cultivated twice a year on the 26,000 hectares. Pechiparai dam was built to cater to the needs of these paddy fields,” says eminent environmentalist RS Lal Mohan of Nagercoil.
 
 He cited drastic drop in the tanks as a reason for farmers abandoning paddy. 
 
 A Central Ground Water Board report in 2008 shows that there were only 2,623 tanks then.
 
 “We have only 2,240 rain fed tanks now. System tanks under the control of the public works department are also not properly desilted and maintained,” he claimed. Pointing to government records for an   query, he said paddy production in the district was 46,000 metric tonnes (MT) in 1984, 33,000 MT in 1987, 20,594 MT in 2000 and 16,718 MT in 2011. 
 
 He hopes that proactive measures taken by the government could revive paddy cultivation. But agriculture officials and paddy farmers are not that optimistic.
 
 A paddy farmer for more than four decades, P  , 61 of Erachakulam, said labour cost had shot up from Rs 15 a day in the mid 1970s to Rs 600 and Rs 700 a day.
 
 “Last year we got up to Rs 60,000 per acre paddy before the rains and a mere Rs 26,000 per acre when the monsoon began as paddy started absorbing moisture,” said Shenbagasekarapillai.
