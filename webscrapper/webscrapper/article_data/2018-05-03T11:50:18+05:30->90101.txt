A 22-year-old girl was assaulted and allegedly molested ostensibly for wearing shorts and smoking on the road on April 2016. The   with anger: 

 
  
 
  Two years have passed since I fell victim to moral policing and nothing has changed. 
 
 My friend I was returning home from another friend's place. We had stopped near   at   for a smoke when six people, led by an elderly person, walked up to us and began abusing us for smoking openly. "How dare you smoke in a public place and, that too, being a woman?" he had said. Another man beside him had said, "How dare you wear such clothes in a decent neighbourhood like ours?" I was wearing shorts.
 
 Offended, my friend pointed to a man standing nearby and smoking. "What's harm in a girl smoking openly?" he had said. Incensed by this argument, the man who had raised objection slapped my friend. When I tried to save my friend, the man pushed me. As I started screaming, he walked away, daring us to visit the neighbourhood again. I lodged a police complaint and got them arrested but they got bail. 
 
 I was thrashed for smoking and now, a young couple was attacked simply for hugging each other. I don't know what we are heading for. Everyone should understand people of different generations are occupying the same space. Children, young adults and the elderly are walking along the same road and using the same public transport. Why should a person have to hide something he/she likes? Why we will have to behave differently in front of the elders? Why should it bother anyone if someone embraces his/her friend or is smoking? Everyone should have his own share of freedom. I wonder when will we, the people of Kolkata, will learn about it.
