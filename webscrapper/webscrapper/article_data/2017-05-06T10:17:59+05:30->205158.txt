 Manoharan Menon, officer on special duty, controller of unauthorized construction (CUC) department, told TOI: “A total of seven plots in Khanda Colony have been tendered. The prime plots are close to Panvel, Sion-Panvel Highway and old Mumbai-Pune Highway. The plots are on both sides of the Panvel-Diva railway tracks, and there are schools and a shopping mall close by.”
 
 Bids will be accepted on May 30. The base price is pegged at Rs 36,000 a square metre and the total land area is around 84,000 square metres, Menon said. Cidco expects a maximum of Rs 400 on bidding on the base price. 
 
 The bidding will be a reality check on the demand for prime land in the city and interest shown by well-known builders and developers. 
 
 Cidco wants signature developers to evince interest in the projects. 
 
 Meanwhile, Bhushan Gagrani, managing director, Cidco, has entrusted marketing of the plots to the CUC department to make it accountable in case of encroachment on the plots, if any, and instil faith in bidders. This is perhaps the first time that the marketing department has not been roped in, though the sale of plots involves a three-star hotel.
 
 Menon said, “Three years ago, we had removed the  , but the hutments reappeared. We again undertook a drive on the plots that are to be developed and cleared the encroachments, but once again the problem has resurfaced. We will be removing them shortly.”
