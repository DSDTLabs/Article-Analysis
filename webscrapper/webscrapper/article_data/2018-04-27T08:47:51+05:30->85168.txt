It’s always a good idea to celebrate your   doing things you enjoy the most, and that’s what   believes. He has been performing plays on his birthdays for two years, this year he wanted to do something different. And so on his 55th birthday, he decided to invite his friends over for a small   that had specially designed frames with small pieces of his writings on display. “These are the thoughts that I have been penning down,” he said as he took one of his friends around. Shivjeet told us that he decided to name the exhibition The   as each piece of writing reflects on our lives. “They might have a different meaning to different people, but each one of us can relate to these,” he said.

 In the last few months, Shivjeet was occupied with his start-up, which he says, “has been very challenging.” “I realised that when you have a start-up, you live 50% of your life in terror, 30% thinking if things are okay and 20% wondering what to do. It is long-term vision, mid-term planning and short-term desperation. As I used to mediate, some thoughts would come to my mind and I thought if an artist can display art, then why can’t a writer display his writing? So I did this for the first time and if people would like it, I would continue doing it,” he said, adding that he has always loved spending his birthdays with his close friends and family.
