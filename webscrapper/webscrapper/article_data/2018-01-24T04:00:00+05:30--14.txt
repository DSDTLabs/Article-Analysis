Surat: Desirable accessibility and mobility pattern for people and goods in an urban agglomeration are core of a Comprehensive Mobility Plan (CMP) and Surat Municipal Corporation is on the course to have one soon within a month’s time.  The SMC made a presentation on CMP-2046, the draft of which is ready, before different stakeholders here on Monday. The draft of CMP-2046 which has been prepared by Cept University, Ahmedabad, envisages moving nearly 1.2 lakh people with 65 lakh vehicles on a 5,000km road network spread over 500 sq km area in the city.  Intelligent transport with inbuilt signalling will be the order of the day in 2046 in Surat, the eighth most populous city in the country with a rapid growth rate.  Professor H M Shivanand Swamy of Cept University told TOI, “We have looked at a number of things in Surat to make it more mass transport friendly and strengthen the infrastructure to meet the challenges after three decades. We feel that innovative measures will further help push the city’s high growth rate.” At present, a textile item has to move seven times to different places within the city for varied processes. A textile hub that has been envisaged in the south-east zone of Surat will minimize the movement of the goods on city roads. Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “The plan is a visualization of the scenario with respect to the city’s mobility in 2046. This has been prepared because we don’t want to be caught sleeping.”
