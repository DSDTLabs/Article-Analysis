LUCKNOW: A thunderstorm left many areas of the city in the dark due to power cuts late on Friday night.

  (Lesa) resorted to a shutdown in many places as a precautionary measure when the storm hit the city. However, the cuts lasted long as electricity wires and poles were damaged in many parts due to strong winds and uprooted trees and hoardings.
 
 Frequent and long power outages were reported from Hazratganj, Mahanagar, Lalbagh, Kaiserbagh, Husainganj, Aminabad, Kapoorthala, Indiranagar, Vikasnagar, Aliganj, Alambagh, Mawaiyya and Gomtinagar. The situation came back to normal only by Saturday noon.
 
 Anshika Sethi, a resident of Mahanagar, said, “Power supply was disrupted around 2am and was not restored till 6am. We had to leave the house for Delhi early morning but due to the power cut and weather, we left after 9am.”
 
 Shubhankar, from  , said, “We woke up around 3am due to a power cut. I saw a broken pole lying on my car. I called the Lesa helpline but the number was not reachable. I went to the nearest substation with a complaint but no one was there. I left a written complaint. My family spent hours in worry. Around 8am, a team arrived and fixed the problem.”
 
 Khushi Zaheer, a resident of Lalbagh, said, “We were up since 3.30am, when a huge tree fell on the roof of our house due to the thunderstorm which broke down electricity wires. We called   (LMC) helpline but the number was busy. We got relief only after 9am, when Metro workers intervened and cut down the tree. Fortunately, there was no damage.”
 
 “A majority of areas were affected due to the thunderstorm. Some reported with complaints of trees fallen on poles and some about collapse of hoardings. Supply was disturbed in many parts. All problems and issues were solved by 10am and supply was restored,” said Lesa chief engineer (trans-Gomti) Pramod Kakkar.
