Ludhiana: A fire burned down nearly 10 acres of a reserve forest next to Tiger Safari in Bhattian near here on Friday. Though no animals in the zoo were injured in the blaze, it kept forest officials on their toes for almost two hours as they tried to extinguish it. 

 Ludhiana district forest officer Khushwinder Singh said there was open access to the forest area from the main road. “Since the blaze started on a roadside, we suspect it to have been triggered by a burning cigarette or beedi,” he said.
 
 The forest officer said most of the vegetation in the area had wilted, so the fire spread rapidly to at least 10 acres of forest. “We first saved all the animals and then tried to control the blaze. He, however, to a lack of fire safety measures at the Tiger Safari. “We will procure equipment soon,” he said.
 
 The fire has yet again exposed the lack of preparedness of the forest department, as a blaze had broken out in the same area nearly a year ago, on May 8, 2017.
 
 The fire brigade got the phone call from the department around 2.45pm. The official said three fire engines were pressed into service to douse the flames.
 
 A senior official in the forest department, who did not wish to be named, said forest ranges in Ropar and Garhshankar had their own fire enginers. “Though there are increased chances of   in summer, we do not have any such equipment,” he said. 
 
 Before the firefighters could reach the spot, workers of the forest department had been trying to douse the flames by using hand tools and trying to stop it from spreading.
