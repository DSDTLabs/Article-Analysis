MANDYA: Three persons in a single selfie frame could be bad company. Two police officers from   district didn’t realize their selfie with a murder accused inside a police station would create a storm on social media and result in an inquiry from their higher-ups.

 According to sources,   inspector (CI) D P Dhanaraj and Rural sub-inspector Chidanand clicked a selfie with Kenchagowdanahalli Amit, a murder accused, inside the CI’s office in   taluk.
 
 Amit claims he’s a party worker, but is listed in police records as a rowdy. He is in police custody, facing charges in murder, attempt to murder and riot cases. The freezeframe moment with the customary seflie pout has raised eyebrows among senior police officers and concerned citizens as soon as the photograph went viral on social media on Sunday morning.
 
 A senior police officer said the selfie has breached all limits of decorum and propriety. “The officers should have been suspended pending inquiry within minutes of the selfie surfacing on social-media groups. Unfortunately, officers without patronage are suspended on flimsy grounds, but those enjoying political clout are allowed to go scotfree,” he said, alluding to recent incidents in which police officers are made to pay the price for alleged dereliction of duty. The suspension of a top police officer in the   is a case in point.
 
 District superintendent of police G   ordered an inquiry into the incident. She told TOI that action should be taken against the officers if they were guilty.
 
 MB Naganna, a social worker, alleged that misconduct of Mandya police officers was on the rise and the selfie was a shameful incident.
