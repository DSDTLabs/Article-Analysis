KOLKATA: Police have arrested the husband of homemaker Tumpa Pal, who was found murdered inside her rented residence in Chetla.   Pal, 42, was traced from near   station.

 The cops have found cut marks on Surajit’s hand, which suggest that he had tried to commit suicide. “A cloth hanging from the fan at the place of incidence also hint that he even tried to hang himself but could not muster up enough courage,” said an investigating officer. Cops claimed that the accused accepted to the  .
 
 According to police, Surajit suspected that his wife having an extra-marital relationship and that she was spending a lot of time on social media. The accused even claimed that he was not served food by his wife on several nights.

The relationship came out in the open about a year ago. Earlier, he had even threatened to murder his wife.
 
 Police started suspecting Surajit based on information given by their younger son, a first-year student, and his elder brother who’s at   to attend a relative’s wedding. “They said that their parents often argued and how their father threatened their mother after the illicit affair became public. It was clear that someone known to the victim had gained entry,” said an officer.
 
 “It was then that the younger son pointed out that his father had left with his bag and  . We found both inside the house. Surajit had pre-planned the murder. He had returned around 3.30 pm and committed the murder by 5 pm. We presume he might have first hit her on her head with a chopper from behind (it was later recovered) and then used a towel to strangulate her,” he added.
