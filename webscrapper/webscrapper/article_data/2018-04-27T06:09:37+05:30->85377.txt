CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Thursday ordered a CBI inquiry into allegations of illegal trade of   in   with the involvement of some government officials and public servants. Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption has been investigating the case following an order by the Madurai bench of the high court on a plea by a lawyer. 

  "The underground gutka business is a crime against society which needs to be curbed. We, therefore, deem it appropriate to direct the CBI to investigate into all aspects of the offence of illegal manufacture, import, supply, distribution and sale of gutka and other forms of tobacco, which are banned in Tamil Nadu and  , including action against those involved in the offence directly or indirectly," the first bench of Chief Justice   and Justice Abdul Quddhose said while passing the order on a PIL moved by   of the DMK. 
 
  The court, however, said it's order "need not be construed as a finding of the court of the complicity of any constitutional functionary or of any specific official of the state." 
 
  Welcoming the order, opposition parties demanded the resignation of CM Edappadi K Palaniswami. "Sale of gutka was going on even when J Jayalalithaa was CM. If the case has to be probed fairly, health minister C   and DGP T K Rajendran must resign. In fact, we demand the resignation of the K Palaniswami government," DMK leader   said.
