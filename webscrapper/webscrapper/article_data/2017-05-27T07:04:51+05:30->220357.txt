BERHAMPUR: If the migratory birds of Chilika Lake flock to Nalabana during winter,   turns into their favourite haunt in summer. A recent census of birds at the lake threw up this interesting fact. The survey revealed that the highest number of waterfowls had taken shelter in Mangalajodi after Nalabana this summer. 

 "As many as 39,731 birds of 107 different species were found in the lake during the bird count conducted on May 19. Of these, around 28,831 birds of 54 species and 10,900 of 53 species were found to be waterfowls and resident birds, respectively," said Bikash Ranjan Das, divisional forest officer,   Division. 
 
 While more than 10,000 birds were sighted in the Mangalajodi area, around 8,700 birds were seen on the 15.59 sq km stretch of the Nalabana bird sanctuary during the survey, he added. "This goes to show that Mangalajodi has emerged as the preferred place for birds, both resident and migratory ones, during summer," said an ornithologist. 
 
 They flock to Mangalajodi as the island boasts of several swamps. On the other hand, Nalabana, goes dry in the scorching heat. This may be one of the causes behind the birds' movement towards Mangalajodi, explained DFO Das. 
 
 Several species of the winged guests, which had flown to the Chilka Lake in last winter, were found in the blue lagoon in the sultry summer afternoons. Species like greater flamingo, spot-billed pelicans, painted storks, spoonbill, black-headed ibis, little egrets, etc were sighted on the vast Chilka Lake during the summer count of birds.
 
 The highest number of little cormorants (3886) and Asian open stork (3294), which are the resident birds, were found in the lake during the enumeration. 
 
 In 2016, as many as 41,569 birds of 113 species had been spotted at the lake during summer. These included 31,195 waterfowls of 56 species and 10,374 resident birds of 57 species, sources said. 
 
 Around 9.47 lakh birds of 167 species had visited the Chilika in last winter. These included 9.24 lakh waterfowls belonging to 100 different species and 22,766 birds of 67 wetland dependent species, the sources said.
