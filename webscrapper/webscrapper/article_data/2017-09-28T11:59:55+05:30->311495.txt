Upcoming film 'Call For Fun' is a perfect blend of fresh talent and established artistes. Along with nine newbies, the youth-centric comedy also features four National Award winners —   (composer),   (editor) and   and   (sound designers). 

 Director  , who is also one of the producers of the film, states, “The expertise that these established names have brought to the table is immeasurable. The movie also has a novel concept — people grappling with loneliness. Backed by a strong technical team, it has shaped up as well as a big-budget entertainer.” 
 
 Producer   adds, “While fresh content and talent are the need of the hour, a sound technical team and financial backing are equally important. Our film scores on all counts.”
