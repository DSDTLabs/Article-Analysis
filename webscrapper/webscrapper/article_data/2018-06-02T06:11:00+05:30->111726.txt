GHAZIABAD: Parents of the six-and-a-half-year-old boy, who died after falling into the basement of a   housing society, have donated their son’s eyes before cremating his body.

 A neighbour of the family has said that  , who studied in Class II, was playing with his friends on the second floor of   apartments when he stepped on to a fibre-sheet, which had been installed to provide cover to the floor below, to collect a ball. The fibre-sheet, already weakened by a flower pot crashing into it during a recent dust storm, crumbled under the boy’s pressure and he fell into the basement below, the neighbour said. There is no   camera in the rear of the building where the accident took place.
 
 Garvit was on ventilator support for a day before succumbing to his injuries on Thursday. “Garvit’s eyes were donated ahead of the cremation. It’s a formal procedure, for which the hospital had taken our permission,” said Praveena Garg, Garvit’s mother.
 
 Lata Sagar, a neighbour of the  , said: “The loss is immense and the family is coping with it. The incident highlights the need for installing safety measures in residential apartments, especially for children. The accident is unfortunate and it sets an example for every other family with children.”
