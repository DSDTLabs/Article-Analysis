SURAT:   (SMC) has started work to set up a   which will provide 35 million litre per day (MLD) of treated water to industries in Sachin. The sale of treated water through the water supply network from Bamroli tertiary treatment plant to industries in Sachin would help SMC earn handsome revenue. 

 SMC has been for the past five years providing 40 MLD of treated water to industries in   from its 40 MLD plant in Bamroli. Once the water supply network is ready by May 1, SMC would start supplying 35 MLD of treated water to 68 industries in Sachin too. 
 
 “The 35 MLD of treated water would be supplied through 11.5km-long network from the water plant to the units in Sachin. The water would be first pushed up to an elevated tank and then supplied to 68 industries. Water meters would be installed in these units,” SMC executive engineer E H Pathan said. 
 
 SMC would incur an expenditure of Rs 130 crore in setting up the infrastructure, including the new tertiary treatment plant. A grant of Rs 121 crore was given for the project by state government from the Swarnim Jayanti Chief Minister Urban Development Scheme. The contribution of the industries is around Rs 9.17 crore.
 
 The industries of Sachin and the civic body had signed an agreement in 2016-17 with regard to the supply of treated water at the rate Rs 22.50 per litre with 6 per cent rise every year. Now the supply of treated water would start from May 1. The rate could see at least 12 per cent increase.
 
 SMC is the only civic body in the country to have its own tertiary treatment plant. 
 
 “SMC would earn handsome revenue from the sale of treated water. What is more important is that SMC would be able to save 35 MLD of potable water on a daily basis,” a SMC officer said.
