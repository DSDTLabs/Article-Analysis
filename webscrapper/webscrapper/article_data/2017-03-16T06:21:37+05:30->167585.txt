INDORE: Even as state government claims to focus on developing reading habit among children by coming up with campaigns like 'Mil Banche', the annual status of education report (ASER) 2016 released recently by an NGO Pratham has revealed that half of the students in Class I in   can't even read basic letters of their mother tongue-Hindi. 

 The survey shows variation in children’s reading levels within a given grade. Among children in Class III, over 66 per cent students cannot even read the letters, while 82.4 per cent cannot read words.
 
 Barely 17.6 per cent can read Class I level text chosen as reading tool, while only 16.6% can read Class II level text.
 
 The NGO visited over 15,000 government schools. Of them 8,844 were primary and 6,362 were upper-primary schools, which also had primary sections. Over 896 primary schools and 343 upper primary schools were visited in 51 districts of the state.
 
 Apart from the 2016 annual statistics, the survey also shows a comparative trend over the years revealing low   among students of government and private schools in the state. 
 
 In a comparison of reading level among students from 2010 to 2016, 11.3 per cent students can read Class II level text in 2010, while average number of students, who can read Class II level text went down to 10.2 per cent in the year 2016.
 
 As per ASER, 33 per cent of Class III students from private schools were able to read the text in 2016, while in 2010 it was recorded 24.2 per cent. 
 
 Educationists said that schools now have better infrastructure because of   and the RTE Act, but learning must show improvement.
 
 "Year after year, the ASER comes out like a ritual, but the government fails to take action. New targets must be set for teachers and salaries must be paid based on their performances. The report is a true reflection of education system in rural areas in the country and nobody seems to take enough cognizance of the results," said an educationist from the city.
 
 It is not just Hindi proficiency that is dismal; students of the state cannot even read English alphabets. 59.6 per cent students from Class I cannot even read the alphabets. Not only junior classes even the middle school students couldn’t achieve good results. 
 
 Barely 26.7 per cent students in Class VIII were able to read easy sentences in English during the survey.
