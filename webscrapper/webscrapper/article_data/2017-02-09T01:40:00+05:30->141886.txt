MUMBAI: There may be more trouble in store for   Hemangi Chemburkar who was caught along with her personal assistant on Tuesday accepting a bribe by the   (ACB).

 Immediately after arresting Chemburkar, the ACB carried a search of her residence at Dadarkar Arcade in Parel village and found 700 gm gold, two kg silver and Rs 95,000. The police said the total value of the gold and silver jewellery is more than 30 lakh . “She will have to explain how she amassed these assets. If she fails to justify it, then we may register a disproportionate assets case,” said an ACB official. Chemburkar and her aide, Rajaram Redkar, were produced before the special ACB court, which remanded them in police custody till February 11.
 
 “This is not a stray case as some more hoteliers from her ward have approached us complaining of extortion by Chemburkar. We are in the process of recording their statements and we are likely to make the new complainants witnesses in our case to prove that Chemburkar used to threaten hoteliers and extort money,” added the officer. Chemburkar, who is from ward 199 (Worli), is also the chairperson of the civic ward committees of F South and F North wards. She is not contesting the BMC elections this time but the issue is becoming an embarrassment for Shiv Sena, as its arch rival,  , will use it to target the party.
