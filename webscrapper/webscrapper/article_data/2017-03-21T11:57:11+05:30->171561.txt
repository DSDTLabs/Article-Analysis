RANCHI/DUMKA: The BJP on Monday named its state vice-president   as the candidate for the Littipara by-election to be held on April 9. 

 In a statement, BJP spokesperson Pravin Prabhakar said the party's state election committee had authorized chief minister Raghubar Das to select the candidate for the Littipara seat. "The CM had a discussion with the party's Santhal Pargana workers in Dumka on March 17, following which the decision to name Murmu was taken. BJP president Amit Shah's consent was also taken while selecting the candidate," he added. 
 
 Murmu, a former health minister in the   cabinet in 2009, will file his nomination papers on Friday. He will be accompanied by state social welfare minister Lois Marandi and state BJP president Laxman Gilua when he goes to the office of the returning office. Murmu is also a former MP from Rajmahal constituency. Before he was elected to the  , he had won the Barhait assembly seat from 1985 till 2004 as a   Mukti Morcha (JMM) candidate. 
 
 The JMM, on the other hand, is yet to choose between the two widows of deceased MLA   Murmu as its candidate for the seats. A JMM source said the party earlier postponed the announcement of its candidate because of differences among its senior leaders. Amid all this, senior party leader Simon Marandi fon Monday filed his nomination papers to contest the seat as an independent. He had defected to the JMM from the BJP in January.
