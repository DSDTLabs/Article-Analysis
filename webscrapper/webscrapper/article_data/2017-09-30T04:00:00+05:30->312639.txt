Vadodara: Going a step further after banning the Blue Whale Challenge, city police with the help of Rotary Club of Baroda, organized a workshop on Friday to educate young students about the perils of the game. 

 Students of a private school were made aware of the game and its consequences by Manish Gokani, a cyber safety expert who was roped in by the cyber cell of detection of crime branch . 
 
 “Students were told about the dangers of the game and informed that the game has been banned by the police,” said Pinakin Parmar, assistant commissioner of police (crime). The students were asked to inform the police or their parents if they come across anyone playing the game. Similar workshops will be organized in colleges and for other citizens too. “Young students spend lot of time on the internet. So it is important to educate them about the legalities and hazards. During the workshop, the students were informed about certain websites that require 18 and above years of age for registration. They were also educated about cyber-bullying and other cyber security issues,” Parmar told TOI. 
 
 The hazards of uploading and sharing photos online were also explained to the students.
