Porvorim: Chief minister Manohar   told the legislative assembly on Thursday that scanning, digitalization and micro filming of birth and death records from 1914 to 1970 of all talukas have been completed and those documents will be issued to applicants by September.

 “Within two months we will give people digitalized documents. The processes have been completed,” said Parrikar during the question hour while replying to a question tabled by Curtorim MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.
 
 Lourenco said digitalization is taking long and people seeking birth or death records dated prior to 1970 are put to hardships and sought to know when the issue would be resolved.
 
 Parrikar said they could not progress further because website platform was not synchronized. “Synchronization has to be done. I’m monitoring it. We should able to give digitalized documents from August but subject to any technical problem,” he said. The documents would be available in municipalities as well, the CM said
 
 All the offices of registrar of births and deaths are located at taluka level offices of sub-registrar.
 
 To a supplementary question posed by Velim MLA Filipe Neri Rodrigues, Parrikar said the new staff at the registrar of births and deaths are not proficient in Portuguese and if pre-Liberation records are sought then there is a problem. The CM said there have been instances when people have torn pages from the register itself.
