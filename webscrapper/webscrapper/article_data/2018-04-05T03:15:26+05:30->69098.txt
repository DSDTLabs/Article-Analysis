 Alarmed after being informed that at least eight properties along with Haksar Haveli, the centuries-old heritage building in old Delhi may be on verge of being destroyed by builders for their “financial lust”, a bench of acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice C Hari Shankar ordered immediate physical inspection of these by the commissioner of North Delhi Municipal Corporation and sought a report.
 
 HC acted on a batch of matters where the latest plea was filed by petitioner Kusum Sehgal, who alleged rampant unauthorised construction was being carried out in the famous heritage property
 
 The bench ordered Delhi Police to ensure that no construction is carried out in the buildings in violation of law.
