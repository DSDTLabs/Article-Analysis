He complied, but his women friends accompanied him.The women students told the police that SFI workers followed them and assaulted their friend.When the two women tried to intervene, they were shoved away.
 
 “That was nothing but an act of moral policing,“ one of them said. “Prima facie, there seems to be a case as the complainant has sustained injuries,“ sub-inspector B M Shafi said. Jijesh was later hospitalized.
 
 SFI leader and college union chairman   accused Jijesh of misbehaving with a women student. “We directed her to the principal.There was no act of violence from our part,“ he said.
