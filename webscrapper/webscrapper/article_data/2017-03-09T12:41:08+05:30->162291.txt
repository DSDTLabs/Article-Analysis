BHOPAL: This play was carved out of real life. And the cops, who have been rehearsing for last four days, did the hard stuff with a gentle touch and the unfolding began with a disclaimer, “All incidents in the play are based on true events. Characters in this play are real police officers.”

 Stepping out of their busy schedules, senior officials of MP police, International Women’s Day, donned the hats of writers, theatre artistes to stage their real life experiences, especially while handling crimes against women.
 
 “Aks- Ek Nayi Bayar” was staged at Antarang auditorium of Bharat Bhawan. IGP Dinesh Chand Sagar stepped into the shoes of a physically-challenged SP. Also, sub-inspectors and assistant sub-inspectors played the role of women victims, goons, pickpockets and kidnappers.
 
 The play was written and directed by Farid Bazmi, in-charge for MP police headquarters library. ADG women Aruna Mohan Rao scripted the hypothesis of the play.
 
 “The play was a slice of real life. I play the same role in real life. So, I kept my dialogues similar to day-to-day lingo,” said Dinesh Chand Sagar, who took the character of a blind man to inspect the station, which was being reported about irregularities. 
 
 The plot, which embraced actual crude experiences of victims, revolved around the functioning of problems faced by women complainants.
 
 The narration starts with the story of an ill girl who becomes SHO for a day. However, as time passes she resolves cases easily. The play also talks about trafficking of girls and boys. Taking cognizance of several incidents, the SP forms a committee of women police officers who cracks the case arrests the traffickers.
 
 “The play answered questions about the role of women, gender inequality and importance of dial 100,” said Aruna Mohan Rao. The idea was to say that the job of police is very sensitive. They serve the people 24*7.
