GAYA: The chancellor’s office is likely to send fresh queries to Magadh University, seeking specific answers regarding the controversial   as the principal of A N S College, Barh, to A N College, Patna, Raj Bhavan sources said. 

  had sent a letter to Magadh University (MU) on January 19, seeking answer in yes or no whether Shahi was shifted from Barh on the university’s transfer committee’s recommendation and the chancellor’s nominee was present or not in the meeting, if it took place at all.
 
 Sources said the MU’s response dated February 2 ducked a direct answer to the queries and, instead, justified the transfer on the basis of somewhat vague  . Interestingly, the Patna high court had quashed Shahi’s appointment as principal and an appeal is pending in the Supreme Court against the order.
 
 Besides Shahi’s transfer, the chancellor’s office also wanted to know under what circumstances Bimal Prasad Singh was removed from the post of bursar of AN College, Patna. The MU response to this query was also evasive. It was Bimal who had challenged the appointment of MU principals and his removal from the bursar post is being seen as an act of vendetta.
 
 Raj Bhavan sources say the chancellor’s office is not convinced with the MU response. 
 
 In one of his recent judgements, Justice A K Tripathi of Patna high court observed that the vice-chancellor was not a monarch and the occupant of such high position was supposed to be familiar with rules and regulations. According to Shiv Jatan Thakur, an expert in university affairs, only the duly constituted transfer committee is mandated to effect transfers in the state universities.
