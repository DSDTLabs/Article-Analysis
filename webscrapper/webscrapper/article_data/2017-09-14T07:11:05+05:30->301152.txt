NAVI MUMBAI: A Dombivli-based woman, whose daughter was allegedly killed in Dubai, has filed an affidavit in Bombay high court stating that her son has been getting death threats. She alleged that they were being threatened so that she grants mercy to her son-inlaw, who is on death row as per UAE criminal law. The families are also involved in a legal tussle over the custody of the couple's child.

 Usha Dhananjayan, originally from Kerala, has also submitted an application at a Dombivli police station about the death threats received by her son, who lives in Dubai, and sought police security .
 
 The murder accused,   (29), is slated to face the firing squad in UAE later this year, as his death sentence was reconfirmed by the highest court of the country , unless kin of his deceased wife, Nimmy (known as Bushra Popere after marriage), grants him mercy as per the Sharia laws there.
 
 Their eight-year-old minor daughter is currently residing with her paternal grandmother, Firoza Popere, in Raigad district. However, Nimmy's mother, Usha, is presently fighting for custody in Bombay HC.
 
 On Tuesday , Usha filed an affidavit in the high court stating that her son Nigil has received multiple death threats from a supposedly Pakistani national in Dubai, in order to force her to sign a mercy petition and save the life of her son-in-law.
 
 “I will never grant mercy to that man (Atif) for killing my daughter in Dubai in March 2013. He and his accomplice were later arrested by the Dubai police, and awarded death sentence in December 2015. Her in-laws have not shown any remorse, and on the other hand, are using unfair tricks and false allegations to not give me custody of Nimmy's daughter. I will legally fight it out.“
 
 When TOI approached Atif 's mother, Firoza, at Bombay HC on Tuesday evening, she declined to comment on the issue of her son's death sentence or the custody battle.
 
 Nimmy and Atif had a love marriage in 2008, and thereafter moved to Dubai.
