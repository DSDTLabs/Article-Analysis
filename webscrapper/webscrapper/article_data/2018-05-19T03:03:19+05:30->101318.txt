NEW DELHI: A 12-year-old girl was crushed to death by a speeding dumper while she and her 14-year-old brother were waiting on a divider to cross a road in  , near  , on Friday morning.

 
 The brother is critical. The dumper carrying building material tried to overtake a truck when the driver lost control on the narrow road and crushed   and her brother, Irshad, against the grille of the divider. 
 
 They were dragged for a few metres after which the driver stopped the vehicle and tried to flee. He was caught by locals and thrashed before being arrested. He told police he was in a hurry to cross the Delhi border to avoid being penalised for violating entry rules.
 
 
 
 The incident took place around 6.45am when Ishrat, a Class 6 student, and her brother, Irshad, were on their way to a government school in   near  . Locals said the dumper, coming from Okhla, was being driven very fast and hit the children, broke through the grille and stopped on the other side of the road. 
 
 “I had heard the boy calling for help. He had injuries on his head, and his legs were stuck between the truck and the grille. He tried to pull himself free and kept calling out his sister’s name,” Tanveer, who owns a shop in Jamia Nagar, said. 
 
 One of the passersby boarded the truck and reversed it to free the children. By then, Ishrat had already died. During interrogation, Pushpender, the truck driver, told the cops that he lost control of it. 
 
 “A case under sections dealing with causing death due to negligence and negligent driving has been registered. Efforts are being made to find out whether the driver was driving under influence,” Chinmoy Biswal, DCP, south-east.
 
 Ishrat’s mother Hanifa, a homemaker, stays in a JJ colony in Okhla’s Shram Vihar. Her husband works in a tailoring unit in Mumbai. “The children were weak in mathematics and were on their way to school to attend special classes. They were walking down as they could not afford a bus,” Hanifa said.
