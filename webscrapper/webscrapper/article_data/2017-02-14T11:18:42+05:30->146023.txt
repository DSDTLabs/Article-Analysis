SURAT: City traffic police blocked two main roads at   crossroads on Monday and encouraged commuters to take alternative routes. For thousands of commuters who pass through Athwa Gate, it came as a surprise. Majority of commuters faced difficulties due to the sudden blocking of the road. 

 Police blocked a section of the road coming from Majura Gate and going towards   and another one going toward Timaliyawad-Nanpura at Athwa Gate. Those going towards Timaliyawad-Nanpura had to take a road to Bahumali Complex or go up to   crossroads. 
 
 People coming from Majura Gate and going to Sardar Bridge or Bahumali Complex in Napura had to take a left turn from Athwa Gate and go up to Chaupati crossing and then take U-turn to return to Athwa Gate. 
 
 “One has to drive a long distance from Athwa Gate to Chaupati due to this new arrangement. Police should try some other options instead of simply blocking the road,” said Samir Patel, a resident of Ring Road, who uses a bicycle for commuting. 
 
 Rohit Kapadiya, another commuter, said, “The blocking of the road is leading to traffic jam.”
