Seems like all those reports of   being upset about Deepika Padukone’s item number in her upcoming film ' ', was a whole lot of smoke without fire. While talking to BT, the 'Dilwale' girl vehemently denied the rumours. She said, “Firstly, I hate the term ‘item number’. It’s a special dance number, which is the title track of our film. If I am offered a superb song like this in some movie, I will lap it up.”
Contrary to reports that Kriti wasn’t aware of the special song, she always knew about it. She asserts, “In fact, I was present on the set when it was being filmed and we had a gala time. It’s not a random song, it’s very much a part of the narrative. Deepika was looking super hot and was the best choice for it.” 
 So, is she good friends with Dippy? “I have bumped into her so many times at the gym and outside. We have mutual admiration for each other. I don’t know her too well personally, but she has had an amazing journey in the industry. She has grown so much and is an inspiration to all of us,” Kriti replied.
