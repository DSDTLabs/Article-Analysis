Gurgaon: Having lost faith in political parties, residents of   have this time decided to field their own candidate for the upcoming  . Residents say they have been facing issues with respect to power, water, road infrastructure and garbage collection for years now, and hope having one of their own as area councillor will help them address their problems faster.

 More than 50RWAS from ward number 29 that includes  , sectors 46, 47, 51 and 57, Sushant Lok 2 & 3, and Malibu Town have come together to put out a list of seven candidates. One of these seven candidates is likely to contest for the post of councillor in the MCG poll.
 
 “We have around 10 people, but some of them are from political parties. After eliminating them, we have seven candidates on our list. We are hoping to zero in on one of these candidates who can relate to our problems and help us solve them,” Tilak Raj Mehta, a resident of Mayfield Garden, told TOI on Saturday.
 
 Residents said for the past several years, they knocked every party’s door hoping for solutions to their civic issues, but no one even gave them a patient hearing. 
 
 “All the previous councillors as well as Huda and MCG never addressed our problems and so we have decided to field one of our own representative in the polls,” said Jitender Singh, a businessman from Sector 46. 
 
 The condition of some of the villages in our ward is worse than those in Chhindwara district. These villages are the true picture of the so-called Cyber City,” said Singh. TOI had earlier reported how the residents from ward number 30 came together as a ‘Civil Community’ and demanded that their ward be transferred to MCG for maintenance so that they do not have to bear the dual expense of property tax and maintenance charges for the upkeep of the civic amenities in the area.
