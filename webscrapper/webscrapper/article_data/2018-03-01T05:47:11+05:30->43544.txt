BENGALURU: A three-yearold female leopard, escaping a forest fire, strayed into amusement park   near Bidadi, around 40km from Bengaluru, on Wednesday afternoon.

 After being alerted by visitors around 4pm, forest department and police officials managed to catch the big cat after three hours. There was some panic among the 800 visitors and 700 staff, but luckily, no one was injured. Wonderla general manager HS Rudresh said, “Visitors were quickly shifted to safe zones, and the fact that it was a weekday helped as the crowd was less.”
 
 About 15 officials of the forest and police departments traced the leopard to an artificial anthill.
