Visakhapatnam: The southwest monsoon is likely to make an onset over the district after June 15 if the current weather conditions continue to prevail further. While the normal onset for north coastal AP is around June 10, last year it entered the region around June 17.

 As per official forecast by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in April, the country will experience a normal southwest monsoon from June to September with nearly 96 percent rainfall.
 
 Experts from the field of meteorology said the favourable conditions is nothing but winds blowing to the southern parts of the country from the sea. The winds should have a requisite strength and direction. They have to sustain and maintain a 3-km height from the ground or an air pressure of minimum 700 millibars.
 
 At present, the winds are blowing at a height of nearly 1.5 km over the Andaman Sea. Once the height reaches 3 km or above, the monsoon will make an onset at Andaman Sea followed by Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.
 
 Weathermen at IMD said monsoon is likely to make onset over the Andaman Sea in a day or two ahead of May 20 if the system maintains the same tempo. The normal onset period of southwest monsoon at Andaman Sea is May 20, while it is June 1 for Kerala, June 5 for south coastal AP, and June 10 for north coastal AP and Telangana.
 
 Speaking to TOI, IMD director YK Reddy said, “The southwest monsoon will be accurately forecast after May 15.”
