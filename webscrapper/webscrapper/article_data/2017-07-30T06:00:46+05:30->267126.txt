AHMEDABAD: After the implementation of Goods and   ( ) earlier this month, the demand for timber has taken a major hit and estimates by industry players indicate their orders are down by almost half. The demand for timber and timber products including plywood and laminates has been hit by some 40%, with plywood coming under 28% taxation.

 While monsoon is the lean season for timber merchants as demand usually dips, industry players say that it has further plunged this year, against the same period last year. The decline in demand is mainly driven by increase in price of timber as well as plywood.
 
 “After implementation of GST, the tax on plywood has become 28%. The increase in tax has led to tremendous confusion among customers who are deferring their purchases. Demand has been affected significantly and we hope it recovers soon,” said  , a plywood trader.
 
 Echoing a similar view,  , president,   (ATMA) said, “There is a significant difference between the tax rates of timber products. While traders will still benefit with input tax credit, for the end-consumer, products will be costlier by an estimated 10%.”
