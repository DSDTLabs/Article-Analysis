BHUBANESWAR: With increasing focus on   in the 2017-18 budget,   dominated by a   particularly STs, is likely to benefit a lot this fiscal, officials here said. 

 More than 83% of Odisha's 4.19 crore people (2011 census) live in 50,118 villages. The rural population includes 22.8% STs and 17.1% SCs. 
 
 The tribal pockets having remained grossly underdeveloped have given rise to proliferation of Maoist activities. Officially 18 districts with large majority of STs have since been declared Left Wing Extremism (LWE) affected pockets.
 
 Though the ministry of tribal affairs got Rs 5,329 crore, just Rs 502 crore more than last fiscals revised estimate, the overall increase in allocation for the welfare of STs across ministries saw an appreciable jump of Rs 6,318 crore as against Rs 25,602 crore of last year's revised estimate.
 
 Poor road connectivity in Odisha has always remained a bane for the ST population even depriving them of basic necessities, let alone availing benefits of the host of welfare programmes being implemented both by the Centre and state government. The recent exposure of malnutrition deaths at Nagada village of Juang tribes in Jajpur district not far from the state capital brought home the point. The plight of southern most Malkangiri district that recently accounted for more than 100 children deaths in   largely because hapless people from inaccessible village could not reach hospital in time is yet another proof of mass isolation of the poor and depraved. 
 
 The budget dispensed with the prevailing rule book provisions and allowed road connectivity to habitations with more than 100 persons in LWE affected blocks.
 
 Earlier, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) had provision for road connectivity to habitations with 250 populations in the Maoist-affected areas. The state government apparently sensing the problem launched its own scheme, Mukhya Mantri Sadak Yojana (MMSY) to villages with more than 100 population.
