BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh’s teenage cricketer   set a unique world record on Monday. Batting in only her third international, Pooja smashed a half-century at the ICC Women's Championship in Vadodara, becoming the first woman to do so while batting for the ninth wicket.

 Pooja’s heroics couldn’t save the match, though, and India lost to Australia by eight wickets. Pooja hit 51 runs off 56 balls with seven fours and a six. It was the 18-year-old’s second ODI.
 
 Hailing from   district, Pooja made her international debut last month in the South Africa tour. Her innings in Vadodara was also important as she saved India from humiliation against the visitors on the home ground in the very first match. Pooja, a medium-pace bowler, came out to bat when Indian were struggling at 113 for 7. Her innings helped India out 200 runs on the scoreboard.
 
 Her coach   told TOI that Pooja broke Kiwi player Lucy Doolan’s record of 48 runs against England in 2009. “This is a great day for her. I wanted to see Indian winning the match. But Pooja’s innings was remarkable. She was the highest scorer in the team and came out at a position where there is less opportunity for any batsmen to stay for a long time on the pitch,” said Shrivastava. 
 
 Pooja is going from strength to strength, he said. “She is just 18. In just three matches, Pooja has proved that she will be an important all-rounder in the future,” said Shrivastava. Pooja has four ODI wickets. She started playing cricket at the age of 12, and got into the state under-19 team at the tender age of 13. Her father B R Vastrakar is a retired BSNL employee.
