“I am at the closed end of the game, maybe that’s why I am so keen to play till last,” that’s how Arun   describes his passion for travelling. The 77-year-old, who has spent significant amount of his childhood in   and also worked as psychology professor in  , has travelled 75 courtiers so far. When asked about how he managed such a feat, he simply answers, “You don’t plan for such things, they just happen.” Besides you need a family which will support you lovingly and financially too, he beams. And why not when famous Marathi-Hindi actress   is his daughter and Sachin is his son-in-law.

  Sabnis realised his passion for   when he found some old broachers of Pompeii (Italy) in his father’s stuff. When he inquired about them, Sabnis’ father told him about his unfulfilled dream. The dream to travel the world! “That was the first straight conversation we had. Otherwise he used to question me and I used to answer. It was the first time I realised that my father was also a man of dream. A man who could not fulfil his dream due to responsibilities. That sparked something inside me. Today, whenever I see a new place, I feel he is seeing it through me,” Sabnis shares emotionally.
 
  This young-at-heart guy visited Antarctica continent on his 75th birthday. “One might think it was too much for my age, but my partner was 81 years old and his wife only allowed him to go if I was going,” Sabnis adds laughingly. However, the journey was not easy on him. “The journey to Antarctica is really hazardous. The turbulence you feel while travelling by sea is unimaginable. But I was determined to go there. The land is so fresh, so alive and untouched by humans. The return journey was quite difficult for me though. I nearly died,” he expresses. Even though the travel might pose some hardship for Sabnis, he is not willing to quite. “My next trip is to Mangolia and Siberia. I am going to take trans-Siberian train and it’s going to be a fun ride,” he adds with child-like enthusiasm.
