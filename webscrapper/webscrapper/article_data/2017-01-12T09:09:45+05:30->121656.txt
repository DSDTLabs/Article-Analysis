MUMBAI: While the story of the first warm-up match between India 'A' and England at the Brabourne Stadium centred around   leading an Indian outfit for one last time, the second practice game at the same venue on Thursday morning will provide a glimpse of what Indian fans can expect from their most promising youngsters in the near future.

 The squad led by   is completely different from the one that Dhoni captained on Tuesday, and the focus in this encounter shifts to the likes of Rishabh Pant, Ishan Kishan, Deepak Hooda and   who have been rewarded for their terrific performances in the Ranji Trophy.
 
 The hard-hitting Pant, in particular, caught the eye in India's premier domestic competition recently, amassing 972 runs in eight matches at an average of 81 for Delhi. The 19-year-old 'keeper-batsman's exploits have also won him a place in India's T20 squad that squares off against England post the ODIs, and he is now being effectively groomed as an understudy to Dhoni in the shorter formats of the game.
 
 Another 'keeper-batsman, Kishan, meanwhile, too enjoyed considerable success in the Ranji Trophy and was instrumental in taking Jharkhand to the semi-finals. The 18-year-old is likely to keep wickets in Thursday's game. This clash also sees Ajinkya Rahane returning to top-flight cricket post an injury break that forced him to miss the last two Tests against England in December and the 28-year-old will be able to assess where he stands in the current scheme of things. Another vastly experienced batsman, Suresh Raina, too has earned a call-up and he would like to make the most of the opportunity in order to enter the T20 series in a positive frame of mind.
 
 England, on the other hand, are likely to field all-rounder Ben Stokes, wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and fast bowler   who were part of the reserves on Tuesday. Ace batsman   is likely to join the team only on Thursday and will travel with the rest of the squad to Pune for the first ODI on January 15.
