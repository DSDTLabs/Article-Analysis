Madurai:Immigration officials on Tuesday arrested two Sri Lankan nationals on a charge of attempting to fly to their country with forged Indian passports, from Madurai airport.

 The accused were identified as S Satheesan, 39, and his wife S Thilaga, 28, who have been staying at Vivekananda Nagar, Batlagundu in Dindigul district for the last few years. 
 
 The immigration officers grew suspicious of the couple after the two, who were about to board a flight to Colombo, spoke a Sri Lankan dialect of Tamil. The couple were detained by the officers and handed over to the Perungudi police who arrested them later.
 
 Police said that the Sri Lankan Tamil couple got married recently and have been living together at Vivekananda Nagar. The accused were on their way to Colombo to visit their relatives. TNN
