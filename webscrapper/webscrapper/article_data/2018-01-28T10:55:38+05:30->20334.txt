We hate to break hearts on a Sunday morning, but here’s the big news.   — among the most glamorous heroines of   — has been secretly married for quite some time. The actress, sources tell us, tied the knot with Victor Ghosh in a low-key ceremony in December a few years back. However, the two of them introduce each other in public as partners in a live-in relationship.

 Nusrat forayed into Tollywood in 2011 with Raj Chakrabarty’s Shotru, and has gone from strength to strength since then, emerging as one of the top female stars in the film industry. She reportedly met Victor, a   boy from a civil aviation background, while travelling abroad and the duo hit off almost instantly. After their secret marriage, they moved into a posh Ballygunge locality.
 
 A source close to them revealed, “They are a married couple. Because of professional and personal reasons, Nusrat does not admit her marriage openly, but all her close friends know about this. She even has a tattoo of Victor’s name inked on her chest.” A few others who have seen them closely said that like any other couple, they go through the highs and lows of life together. While Victor is encouraging about her film choices, Nusrat is supportive of Victor’s efforts in the restaurant business.
 
 Though she has been linked to a Tollywood producer, Nusrat is far from perturbed. The source said even the men she is linked with know she is married and respect that. Victor’s status on   says, ‘in a relationship’, while Nusrat introduces him as her boyfriend in public.
 
 When we quizzed her about her marriage to Victor, Nusrat denied this but would only say that she is engaged to him and the two of them want to get married soon. “The day I get married, the entire city will know about it. It will be a proper seven-day ceremony. We have been living together for the past six years; we will get married within the next year. We are already engaged and our families share an amazing relation,” she said.
