BENGALURU: Match referee   may have termed the Pune pitch 'poor' in his report to the ICC but players from both teams refused to dwell on the demons in the strip on which Australia wrapped up the opening encounter in under three days. Instead, they opted to answer queries about the pitch 'sportingly'.

 Indian opener  , who scored 10 and 2 in Pune, backed the dry turner, stating it wasn't a poor wicket. “Going into a match, I don't see the wicket. I go with an open mindset and if the wicket does something extra I try to adapt to it. I don't think it was a poor wicket. It was much more challenging. As cricketers, we need to play on such wickets than playing on flat tracks or seaming wickets. It tests your ability and I take it that way. Overall it was a good game of cricket. We should have done better in the first innings and the match could have gone longer. But it didn't happen,” said Vijay adding that the M Chinnaswamy stadium pitch looked good.
 
 Seasoned Australian opener David Warner, who contributed 48 runs to his team's total, conceded it was not a typical wicket but was quick to add that it's all part of the game.
 
 “It's up to the ICC and match referees to deal with that. There have been wickets around the world that have been not too similar to what was produced but we were talking about it before. You've got green tops, you've got spinning wickets, you've got ones that sort of explode and take chunks out from Day One. But at the end of the day we've just have to adapt to the conditions and that (pitch) gets dealt with afterwards,” he pointed out.
 
 The ICC chief executive committee had decided to punish venues with below-par pitches and   has 14 days to respond to the international body.
