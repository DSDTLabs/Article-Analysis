GUWAHATI: Three   in the state have been sending back patients without treatment since the   Students' Union forcibly closed down the hospitals for an indefinite period on March 3. 

 The Union has shut down the Dr J.K. Homoeopathic College and Hospital in Jorhat, Swahid Jadav Nath Government Homoeopathic College and Hospital in the city, and   in Nagaon in protest against the lathicharge on homeopathic doctors, junior doctors and medical students by policemen at Last Gate here on March 2. These doctors and students had been agitating since then, demanding that the state government addresses their various demands.
 
 Though these homoeopathic colleges receive around 150 patients for treatment at the out-patient departments (OPDs), they lack adequate facilities to admit patients. "We know that due to the indefinite closing down of the three homoeopathic colleges and hospitals, patients have to return without treatment, but we do not have any other option. We have been repeatedly been asking the state government to upgrade these hospitals so that we can provide high quality treatment to patients. Besides, most of the doctors passing out from these colleges are unemployed. But all our demands have fallen on deaf ears," said Eyasin Ikram Farazi, president of the All Assam Homoeopathic Medical College Students' Union.
 
 "These hospitals even lack basic infrastructure and medical facilities to admit patients. We receive many patients from rural as well as urban areas as homoeopathic treatment is cost-effective. But we can treat these patients only in the OPD. We had repeatedly requested to be allowed to meet state health minister  , but nothing happened. We had even submitted a memorandum stating our demands. So far the state government has not responded," Farazi added.
