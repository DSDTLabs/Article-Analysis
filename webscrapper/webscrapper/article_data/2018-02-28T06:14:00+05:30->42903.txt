NAGPUR: The crisis for   paper   persists as teachers are continuing with their boycott citing no ‘concrete’ response from the government to their demands. Vidarbha Junior College Teachers Association ( ) on Monday again refused to accept the exam instruction dockets from the Nagpur divisional board, thus stalling the paper valuation process.

 Ashok Gavhankar, general secretary of VJUCTA, said, “Almost 4 lakh answer sheets have now piled up because the government has decided to play with the future of both students and teachers. This boycott is not a last minute resort but something that we have been warning the government about since last year. They have ignored all our warnings and ultimately we find ourselves at this juncture,” said Gavhankar. 
 
 On Monday, moderators were called to the board’s office in Civil Lines to collect docket for the Marathi paper. Gavhankar said, “Around 90 moderators were called but nobody took the docket. There were two other moderators for   subject as well and they too refused. The unity being shown by our colleagues is really amazing and we appreciate everyone’s efforts.” 
 
 The VJUCTA general secretary denied the charge by some education officials that the teachers’ stance will hurt the students. “I would say that the government which does not respect teachers is actually hurting students more. We have not demanded anything illegal, just what is rightfully due to us,”said Gavhankar.
 
 There are various demands of VJUCTA but the main among them are related to pay. Gavhankar, said, “When a teacher works for so many years, is it wrong to demand the rightful wage? We want parity with teachers under central government, after all we are doing the same work.”
