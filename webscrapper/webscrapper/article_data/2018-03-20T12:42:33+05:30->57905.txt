KANNUR: To prevent the torture and harassment of elderly people, there is a need to strengthen the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, said P Mohana Das, Kerala Human Rights Commission ( ), acting chairman.

 Reacting to the reports of the torture of a 90-year-old woman,  , by her granddaughter Uppalavalappil Deepa, at Ayikkara here, he said the KHRC has asked the   and district police chief to submit reports.
 
 “Many cases of torture of senior citizens are being reported from the state. Such incidents are being reported from even the upper and middle-class families, which means that we are not at all sensitive towards elderly people,” he said. There are several instances where elderly people are thrown out of the family by children after grabbing their properties, said Mohana Das However, cases of physical torture are rare, he added.
 
 “I have a case before me in which a wealthy senior citizen, who retired from the government service, was thrown out of his house by own children.He is now in an orphanage but these children forget that they would also grow old one day,” said Mohana Das. Though parliament has passed the Senior Citizens Act, the issue is that the onus on acting on such cases is with the RDO.
 
 “Though the RDO can issue directives, there is no proper mechanism to monitor it. To strengthen the Act at the level of execution, the courts should be entrusted with the responsibility of taking up such cases,” he said.
 
 Kerala Women’s Commission (KWC) has also sought a report on the incident from the district police chief. “Once we get the report, we will take suitable action and steps will also be initiated to prevent such incidents,” said KWC member Shahida Kamal.
