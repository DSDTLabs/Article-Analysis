NEW DELHI: India take on South Africa in the first T20I of the three-match series in Johannesburg on Sunday. India lost the Test series 1-2 but won the preceding ODI series by a thumping margin of 5-1. They will now aim to continue their winning run in the shortest format of the game.

 Test and One-day cricket done with, India and South Africa now gear up to play three T20 Internationals at Johannesburg, Centurion and Cape Town over the next one week, with the first of the three scheduled at the Wanderers on Sunday.
 
 Given the pressures of Test match cricket, one that was contested finely between the two teams in the month of January, followed by the One-dayers that revolved around both teams talking about their 2019 ICC World Cup campaigns, the two T20s can be expected to remain a relatively stress-free contest. Both teams are likely to use the opportunity to test new players.
 
 In that, India will have the 31-year-old left-hander   returning to the squad after he last played a T20 International for India exactly a year ago against England, in February 2017.
