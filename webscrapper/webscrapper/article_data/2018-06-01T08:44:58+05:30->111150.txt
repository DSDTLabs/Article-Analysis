CHANDIGARH: While setting aside   government’s policy to regularize the contractual staff, the   has also warned the   “not to become party in any illegal actions just to please their political bosses”.

 HC was upset over the government’s decision to create an unlawful policy that ultimately led to unnecessary and avoidable litigation in the case. It also reprimanded the politicians for making such policies just before the elections “to please voter and political gains”.
 
 “Unless stern action is taken against those involved in these type of actions, this process will not stop. Senior officers are expected to put their strong view forward if that is not in line with law of the land. They should not become party to any action which is patently in violation of law only to please their  ,” observed the bench headed by Justice Rajesh Bindal.
 
 The bench further held that apparently, action was to please the voters. The constitutional scheme as well as Supreme Court judgments were just brushed aside for political gains. It held that such an action was deprecated by SC in its various judgments and need to be deprecated strongly. 
 
 The bench also observed that earlier similar action by the Haryana chief secretary was deprecated, where instructions/policy were issued in violation of the Supreme Court judgments and in reply to a notice issued to show cause as to why proceedings for contempt be not initiated, he was apologetic of his conduct.
 
 HC was of the view that in its own policies, which were already in existence, the state had mentioned that in future, no appointment on ad hoc/contract shall be made and if any such appointment is made, the officers/officials responsible will be liable for disciplinary action. Despite such conditions being there, the state still continued making appointments in illegal/irregular manner but till date action has not been taken against any officer for violation of the terms laid down in the policies, the bench held.
