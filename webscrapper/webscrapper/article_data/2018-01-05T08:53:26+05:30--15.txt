The lawyer said the notice was in the name of Mohsina Kidwai and hence a letter was sent to civic body seeking explanation in this regard, but no explanation was given.

 Opposing the plea, the state government and the LMC counsel pleaded that the assessment order couldn’t be challenged in the high court directly. To this, the Congress advocate replied that the petition was filed for challenging the seizure order and not the assessment order.
 
 After hearing the arguments, the court directed the state and the LMC not to take any coercive measure against the petitioner till next date and further directed them to furnish their response to the petition.
