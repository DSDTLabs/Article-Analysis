MUMBAI: Two persons, including a Nigerian, were arrested recently for duping hundreds after assuring them of loans with minimal documentation and collecting processing fees collectively at Rs18 lakh. 

 The racket, from December 2017 to February 2018, was unearthed after an applicant, R Vishwakarma from Mumbai, approached   of Montreal’s BKC office in January about an SMS he received from the bank on easy ways to avail of a loan. Vishwakarma was one among several victims who received spam text messages of the racket impersonating the bank. 
 
 Investigators found out that the bank accounts were opened with fake identity details that were submitted to four banks. 
 
 “The racket used the same ID cards to get SIM cards which they had used in the bank to get SMS alerts. Investigators first managed to get hold of four victims who approached the bank after they learnt that they have got duped. “We got hold of a transaction of an LCD TV purchased by Minaz Kachwala (42). His arrest led to the Nigerian, Victor Chiddi alias Kandy (45), residing in Kharghar,” said a police officer. 
 
 Bank officials had turned down Vishwakarma, stating they had not sent any SMS to anyone related to any easy loans. But the bank’s vigilance department conducted an internal probe and in the first week of March registered an FIR. 
 
 Based on a complaint received from Anuja B, a bank official, DCP (zone VIII) Anil Kumbhare supervised a team which included BKC police senior inspector  , inspector Dikshika Ware and sub-inspectors Ganesh Thodkar, Amit Utekar and Navnath Kale, and arrested Kachwala on April 24 and Chiddi on April 28. 
 
 The duo is in judicial custody while police are searching for the main accused.
