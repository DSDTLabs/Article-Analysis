MUMBAI:   managing director Ashwini Bhide recently became a victim of DoS (denial of service) attack as her   was   and text messages from citizens protesting against Metro-III at Aarey. 

 The IAS officer was forced to change her number four times as the “phone harassment” lasted over two weeks. Traumatized, she alerted MMRC’s security consultant, retired ACP Sanjay Dani, who lodged a complaint with Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) police last week. Police found out that the calls and text messages were routed from a Bengaluru-based server.
 
 BKC police senior inspector Kalpana Gadekar confirmed that an FIR has been registered against unidentified persons. A police officer said, “It is a typical kind of DoS attack wherein the recipient’s phone is flooded with calls and messages, not allowing him to make calls or use his/her server,” said a police officer.

Police said the non-profit organization had circulated the phone numbers of various officials associated with the project and appealed to citizens to make calls to them. “Two weeks ago, we circulated the phone numbers of the chief minister’s office, district collectors, MMRC chief and other officials involved with Metro-III because it was approved without public consultation. But, we have no role in the unidentified calls,” said Avijit M, trustee of Jhatkaa.org. 
 
 Bhide did not respond to calls and messages from TOI on Wednesday. Dani told police, “Initially, the calls were from one number, later they were made from several numbers...Bhide blocked her number and got new one, but the harassment continued. She had to change her number four times.” —V Narayan
