MAHESHTALA: A student of   who had ranked among the top three in her class at school and passed Madhyamik and   with flying colours took her life on Thursday after a shock result in BSc Part I (Pass). She had to drop Honours and appear for the Pass exam after failing the test last year.

 The girl’s father Proloy Dutta blamed his daughter’s failure and eventual death to Calcutta University’s new rules that came into effect this year.
 
 Parna, 19, was to sit for the international college tests on January 29, ahead of the Part II examination, when she learnt about her failure in the Part I exam on Thursday. The girl, who always ranked either first or second in Maheshtala’s Nungi Balika Vidyalaya School, was unable to deal with the failure and took her life by hanging from the ceiling fan in her room on Nungi Station Road.
 
 Parna had secured first division in Madhyamik with 486 out of 700 in 2014 and 366 out of 500 in HS, a decent 72%, in 2016. Parna’s mother Seema, too, blamed the result for her death.
 
 Proloy, a tea trader whose shop was demolished when the Bata Highland Riverside project came up six years ago, has had no income since then. “My daughter was a good student. But the new examination rules of   got her confused and she failed. My daughter studied without any private tutor and, in fact, tutored others to fund her and her brother’s education. Our son Pushan, a Class IV student, got a distinction in this year’s Britti Pariksha. I was certain Parna would take on the mantle of being the family’s main bread earner soon,” said Proloy.
 
 Parna’s friend Rai Guchait said, “She failed to qualify for honours in the college examination last month. This time, she failed in the BSc (Pass) examination. I believe the changes in CU’s rule was, to some extent, responsible for her poor performance.”
