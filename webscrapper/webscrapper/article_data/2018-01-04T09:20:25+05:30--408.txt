PUNE: Ten years in sport is a long time. And the wheels seem to have come full circle for   and Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert. Herbert had lost to Bhambri twice as a junior in doubles in 2008. But the Indian was a top junior at that time and would win the Australian Open boys' title the following year.

 On Wednesday, Herbert, who has two Grand Slam crowns and 11   titles in doubles, now got the better of Bhambri 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a second round match of the $560,000 Tata Open Maharashtra.
 
 Herbert, a year older to Bhambri, is ranked 81(and a career-best 63) in singles but his doubles ranking is13 with a career-high No. 2 after he won at Wimbledon with   in 2016.
 
 "It is a long time ago. It's a big difference," said Bhambri, the World No. 118, after the loss on the Centre Court at Mhalunge-Balewadi.
 
 "He doesn't play as much singles. He is ranked higher, but on the circuit we all believe â€¦ well, he has done better in doubles," the India No. 1added.
 
 Herbert, while being humble about his own junior record vis a vis Bhambri, looked at himself differently. "I am a singles player who plays doubles," said the former Wimbledon boys' doubles champion. But the interesting match-ups apart, the outcome was a disappointment for Bhambri. "It's a missed opportunity for me to be in the quarterfinals of a Tour event and play either (Marin) Cilic or Ram ( )," he said.
 
 Six of those opportunities came in the second and fourth games of the decider, with the Frenchman hitting his way through 0-40 situation twice before breaking Bhambri, who double-faulted twice in the fifth game.
 
 The other Indian in singles, Ramkumar Ramanathan, lost to World No. 6  , but the 23-year-old came out of the Centre Court with his reputation enhanced. The Chennai lad, ranked 148 in the ATP singlescharts, went down 4-6, 3-6 but held his own against the top seed Croat in the ATP 250 Series hard court event.
