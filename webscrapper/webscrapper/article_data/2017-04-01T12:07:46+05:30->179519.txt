In a recent report it was found that India dropped down two spots on the World Happiness Index. While efforts are being made all over the country to regain the previous position if not supersede it, the state of   is leading by example with the constitution of ‘Happiness Department’ for the mental well-being of its residents. Even by nature, Bhopalis are found to be generally good-humored and laid back. Only an event of magnanimous melancholy can move the quintessential Bhopali to come out of their lassiez-faire way of life. So while the ministry works on increasing the happiness quotient of the state, millenials have come forward with their version of happiness and how it can be increased.
 
  
 
 
 It seemed like a passage right out of a fantasy novel or fairy tale when the launch of a   or Anand Sansthan was announced in the mid of last year. However, with its unique initiatives and well defined objectives, the department has managed to turn skeptics into believers. Neeraj Vashishta, director of the newly constituted department, says, “The main objective of the department is to ensure happiness in the lives of common people, beyond the basic necessities. We are trying to adapt clues from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan. Through various measurement techniques, we will be analysing the significance of their model in the context of our state. Even though their sociological structure and population is different, we can always create a knowledge bank of various activities and plans. A delegation of senior officials will be visiting   in a few weeks to understand the relevance of their prevalent happiness model in our country.” Apart from this, Vashishta also elaborated other objectives which include coordinating with various departments to plan and implement fun activities in mainstream festivals, assessing the state of minds of the citizens of the state at fixed intervals on pre-determined parameters, preparing and publishing a survey report on the state of joy and many more. Looks like the state is in for happy days ahead!
 
 
 
 Just a few weeks ago, the Dalai Lama visited   and spoke about how we can incorporate happiness in our daily lives with simple activities. He said, “The government should try to sow the seeds of happiness in school and college kids. Modern education is based on a materialistic way of life. It is important to question now whether that is enough to create happiness in the society.” When asked about how he tries to stay happy, he smiled and said, “I don’t make an effort to be happy. My happiness is not bound by specific situations and objects. It comes from within. Once I was asked as to how I manage to stay fit at this age. The answer to that will be the same. I do not let anger cloud my perception. I learnt this from my mother. She never had even slightest anger on her face. And trust me, all this is common sense!”
 
 
 
 With the debate on achieving a state of bliss going national, millenials from Bhopal gave their opinion on how the government and citizens can together increase the happiness quotient of the city. Some hilarious and some precise, but opinions all the same, gave way to the discussion with Bhopal Times.

  29, marketing manager, says, “To make the citizens happy, the government can actually work for real benefit of the people and not make it a political gimmick to increase votes. There are many roads and public convenience outlets that are in severe need of maintenance. Our taxes are cut accordingly, but where is the money really going?”
 *
  27, software engineer, adds, “What will make a Bhopali truly happy is if poha jalebi and chai become free! If this is done, we will be in a constant state of bliss.”

 , 26, a banker, feels, “If we have a good number of MNCs in the city, then all age-groups of people will be happy here. The child will never leave the nest, maa khush, beta/beti khush. So it’ll be happiness all over. And the view of the pristine lakes will ensure tranquillity.”

 , 26, freelance artist, says, “Conservation of our natural heritage will definitely ensure happiness. The day we stop releasing pollutants in our rivers and lakes will be the happiest day for our state. And for implementing this no one needs to visit Bhutan. It is common sense.”

 , 21, student, says, “I can speak on behalf of the student community that more number of music concerts in the city can bring us supreme joy. In spite of having a good number of student population we don’t have good quality musical events in the city. Good music makes everyone happy!”

 , 28, a teacher, adds, “While we are on the subject of emulating Bhutan, we should make publicly spitting and spoiling public property a punishable offence. Whenever I see someone spitting on the road I get really irritated. I think other people feel the same. So, if we have to keep our moods happy on the road, this behaviour needs to stop.”
 * 
 , 23, an architecture intern, “If all offices could have ice-cream or kulfi vending machines to beat the heat in the city, it will not only keep the employees happy but also increase their productivity as they won’t be bogged down by the heat.”
