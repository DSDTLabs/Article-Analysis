PANAJI: Students who have cleared the state board Class XII   but want to improve their scores will now be allowed two attempts by the Goa Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education. Chairperson Ramkrishna Samant said that the decision was taken after one of the criteria for entry into IITs was changed last year, making it mandatory that aspirants for the seats should have a minimum score of 75% at the Class XII exam.
 
  
 
 Until 2017, students who had appeared for the March exam could only answer the June supplementary exam to improve their scores.
 
 “Now, if a student who has appeared for the March 2018   wants to improve their scores, they can do so at any two of the following — the 2018 June supplementary exam, the March 2019 board exam, the June 2019 supplementary exam, or the March 2020 board exam.
 
  They can answer any two of these exams during the years following their first board Class XII attempt,” Samant said.
 
 The June supplementary exam is usually held for students who have failed in either one or two subjects and have got the ‘needs improvement’ remark at the Class XII board exam.
 
 But students who want to improve their score can also answer supplementary examination under ‘improvement of marks scheme’. 
 
 Two chances for improvement of marks under improvement scheme are permitted now, as against only one until last year. 
 
 This year, the June supplementary exam will begin from June 7 for theory, while the practical examinations will be held on June 15. PVS Kushe HSS, Assagao, will be the centre for North Goa, and Government Multipurpose HSS, Borda, will be the centre for South Goa.
