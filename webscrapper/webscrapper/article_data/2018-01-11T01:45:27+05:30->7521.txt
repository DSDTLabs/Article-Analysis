MUMBAI: Even as first-year   students have been seeking a postponement of exams, Mumbai University’s department of law released a fifth admission list on Wednesday allotting vacant seats to 19 new students. 

 The LLM exams are scheduled to commence on January 17 and the new allottees can seek admission till January 12. “How are students expected to appear for the exams within five days of getting admission? Anyway, admissions were so delayed that we got less than a month to study,” said a student. 
 
 Members of the   and Goa have also intervened in the matter. “Though the university has promised to look into the matter, they are yet to take a final decision,” said  , president of the university’s Law Students’ Council. Students felt a week’s crash course might help them get acquainted with the LLM pattern of exam. “Unlike LLB, in LLM we have only four questions of 25 marks each. 
 
 The delay in undergraduate results and then admission was not our fault,” said the student. Officials from the examination section remained unavailable for comment.
