GHAZIABAD: The district administration has closed down 126 unrecognised schools in the city. In a recent meeting convened by the district magistrate, officials were informed that about 10,000 students studied in these schools, following which the DM has ordered the Basic   ( ) to ensure that at least 5,000 of them be admitted to nearby schools by June-end.

 “Unrecognised schools were in operation for many years in the city, which lured the students to take admission in primary classes. It was not before these children reached higher classes that they came to know about the fraud at the time of registration. However, by that time, the students were left with no option,” said district magistrate  . 
 
 “Following such complaints, we decided to crack the whip and after sustained survey we found that till date, 126 such schools were operational and it has been closed with immediate effect,” added Maheshwari.
 
 The administration is working to shift the students of these schools to nearby recognised schools. “About 10,000 students will be affected due to closure of these schools and the administration is working overtime to ensure that the affected students are admitted to nearby schools at the earliest,” said Vinay Kumar, BSA.
 
 Maheshwari has asked the BSA to augment the infrastructure of the schools where the students would be admitted. 
 
 “By June end, 5,000 students would be shifted to nearby schools and for the rest of students, efforts are on to accommodate them to other schools. We will not leave any student to suffer,” assured Maheshwari.
