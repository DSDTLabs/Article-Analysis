HYDERABAD: At a time when the city is adding up 'free parking' spaces for commuters, many state run hospitals continue to collect parking fees from patients. 

 Hospitals, including Gandhi hospital, Niloufer hospital, MNJ cancer hospital and even the government maternity hospital in  , continue to charge parking fees from patients. 
 
 While parking charges varies from 15 to 30 between hospitals, parking is usually outsourced through a proper tender process, many poor patients are at the receiving end of high-handedness of parking contractors. 
 
 A tender is rolled out each year for parking contractors and the ones who win the contract considers it from a complete business perspective, leaving no scope for excusing fee on compassionate grounds, say insiders. 
 
 "I had fallen short of 10 at the government maternity hospital and I got an earful from the person manning the parking. Despite repeated pleas, he did not listen to me," said  , a patient's relative. The issue was even highlighted in a tweet, requesting for doing away with parking fees. "Pain of parking fee in government hospitals where poor and lower middle class take services isn't it unfair sir? In Gandhi hospital Parking fees are collected by contractors, in demanding ways. Please remove parking fee in government hospitals and relieve poor from such pain," tweeted a citizen from the twitter handle Nonamer @noonenonameone. 
 
 Even doctors say that the Hyderabad traffic police and   (GHMC)'s effort for opening free parking areas around the city would be useless unless it's not extended to hospitals. 
 
 "There is no point of having such areas, if the poor and distressed do not get the same facility. We see people come here under extremely distressing condition are usually from very poor background. They should not be charged for parking atleast," said a doctor from Gandhi Hospital.
