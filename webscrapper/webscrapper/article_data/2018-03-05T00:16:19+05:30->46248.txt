Pune: The Pune police arrested an Osmanabad resident on Saturday for allegedly sending lewd text messages and making unsolicited calls to a 29-year-old woman from Warje.

 The suspect, Akash Arjun Zombade (21), had been sending the messages since February 17. Warje police has booked him for stalking and has invoked provisions of the Information Technology (IT) Act since Zombade had used a symbol associated with the Indian Army as his profile picture.
 
 Police inspector Prakash Khandekar of the Warje police said that the woman, a housewife, was enraged by the messages and decided to lodge an official complaint. 
 
 Khandekar said “On Saturday, we arrested the suspect, who is a resident of Kalamb in Osmanabad district, for sending lewd and obscene messages to the woman.” He added that the woman and the suspect do not know each other. 
 
 “During questioning, Zombade told us that he had been making some calls in the first week of February. He dialled a wrong number and the woman answered the call. Hearing her voice, he saved the number and started sending her lewd and obscene messages,” Khandekar said.
