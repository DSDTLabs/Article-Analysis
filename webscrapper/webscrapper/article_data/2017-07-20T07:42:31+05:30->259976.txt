AHMEDABAD:   businessman, Ravinder Bansal, has been flying around the globe in his single-engine airplane for a cause. Bansal, 68, is on a mission to spread awareness about   and raise funds for a hospital in his hometown Ambala. For this, he is flying his single-engine plane around the world.

 Soon after his sister-in-law died of breast cancer in 2012, Bansal made every possible attempt to help the hospital in which she was treated.
 
 Bansal said that his sister-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005. “But by the time it was diagnosed, she was already in the second stage of the malignant disease. In then realised that there is serious lack of awareness regarding breast cancer and people often don’t get a check-up done regularly,” Bansal said.
 
 On July 4, he started his journey in the single-engine aircraft from Buffalo Niagara in New York and travelled through various countries. 
 
 “I travelled from New York to Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland, Liverpool, Italy, Greece, Jordan, Bahrain and Oman. I finally landed in Ahmedabad on Wednesday,” Bansal said.
 
 He arrived in Ahmedabad on Wednesday evening and will take off for   on Friday. “Ambala airstrip is managed by the   ( ). Hence, I have sought permission from the authorities to land in Ambala. If I get the permission, I will be in Ambala on Friday thus marking an end to my trip,” Bansal said.
 
 Flying was a natural choice for Bansal as he had taken flying lessons in his college days some 40 years ago. 
 
 “I love every aspect of flying,” he said.
