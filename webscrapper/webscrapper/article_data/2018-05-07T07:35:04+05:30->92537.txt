PATNA: Heavy vehicles, including trucks having 12-20 wheels, will soon be banned on the Mahatma   which is undergoing rehabilitation.

 This has been decided by the state road construction department ( ) in the wake of a recent report from the Union ministry of road, transport and highways (MoRTH), which is executing the rehabilitation project.
 
 An MoRTH official told   it was found by engineers that the gap between different spans of the 5.575km dilapidated bridge was widening due to the one-way traffic allowed on the bridge.
 
 As demolition of the Setu’s western flank is underway, vehicles from Patna to Hajipur and vice versa ply only through the eastern flank these days.
 
 The RCD has written letters to the DMs of Patna and Vaishali to explore alternative routes for heavy vehicles. A meeting in this regard is also slated to be held between senior officials of the RCD and two districts on May 8.
 
 “Only light motor vehicles will continue to run on the bridge,” state RCD minister   told TOI on Saturday and added heavy vehicles could use the JP Setu between Digha and Sonepur in the night or   at Mokama.
 
 The 35-year-old Gandhi Setu is being rehabilitated by AFCON Infrastructure Ltd. The existing superstructure is being completely demolished and triangular steel-girders, as seen in rail-cum-road bridges like Rajendra Setu at Mokama or Abdul Bari Pul at  , are proposed to be erected in its place.
 
 “We have formed a committee of engineers to study the pros and cons of running heavy vehicles on the JP Setu. It prima facie appears that it may lead to snarls,” Vaishali DM   said and added, however, that the administration would find a way out.
