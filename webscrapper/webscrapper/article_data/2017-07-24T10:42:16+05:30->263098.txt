PUNE: The municipal school teachers in the city can expect around 65% raise in their salaries soon.

 The   (PMC) standing committee recently took a decision to this effect to overcome the shortage of teachers in   “Besides job seekers, the hike will also encourage the existing lot of teachers,” a PMC official said.
 
 “Against the current remuneration of Rs 6,000, the salaries will be raised to Rs 10,000 per month. A proposal in this regard has already been approved,” said  , chairman of the committee. He said that the civic administration will work out matters such as financial burden on the civic body following the hike and the budgetary allotments will be done accordingly.
 
 NCP corporator   said that   is a result of PMC’s failed attempts at recruiting teachers. “Hardly anybody approached the civic body after the advertisement was issued. Offering six-month contracts is making it difficult to draw response. The administration should at least make it a one-year contract,” he said.
 
 The elected members on Thursday blamed the civic administration over mismanagement of human resources in municipal schools. The common issues raised by the corporators included non-availability of teachers, poor infrastructure and absence of dedicated governing body to monitor educational activities of PMC. A group of corporators suggested that the civic body join hands with private players to improve the quality of education and increase the number of teachers.
 
 “New advertisements are being issued based on the hiked salary. The civic administration will make sure that more teachers are available in a month’s time,” said municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar.
