 "I'm really sorry to everybody that bought a ticket tonight, I have rescheduled on the 29th so I will be back in Bristol ... in 10 days. This is so annoying, there is nothing worse than cancelling a show, I hate it, I absolutely hate it but sometimes at some point you have to look after yourself and this is what I'm doing.
 
 "I promise that everyone that bought a ticket will get a show so I'm very very sorry I have to reschedule. I love you guys so much."
