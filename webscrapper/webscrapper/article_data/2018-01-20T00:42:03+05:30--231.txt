GURUGRAM:   pressed into   and earth-moving machines to   that was being transported from defunct Bandhwari waste treatment plant and dumped illegally in the  .The corporation swung into action and started removing the dumped   after TOI published the report, ‘Leachate taken from Bandhwari waste plant dumped back in Aravalis’, on Friday.

 “As soon as the officials of MCG came to know about the problem, a proactive action was taken. The MCG has mobilised tankers and JCBs to remove the leachate,” stated a release by the corporation. When a TOI team visited the spot on Thursday, a new leachate dumping site was found in the Aravalis, around 100 metres from the defunct Bandhwari plant. 
 
 There were several small pools of leachate, and a 50m-stretch of un-metalled road soaked with leachate.
 
 MCG officials claimed that leachate was treated scientifically. “The corporation remains committed to ensure safe and scientific disposal of waste collected from the city. As soon as we got to know about leachate, a team was set up to resolve the issue, and the agency was instructed to take required action immediately,” said YS Gupta, joint commissioner, MCG.
 
 Environmentalists, however, demanded a strict action against the plant operator. “Removing leachate once after a media report is not going to solve the problem. The leachate was dumped by the plant operator to mislead the National Green Tribunal (NGT) that there is no leachate coming out of the waste plant. An action should be taken against the operator and MCG officials as it happened two times. Also, leachate should be treated properly,” said Vivek Kamboj, who filed a petition before the NGT in 2016, seeking relocation of Bandhwari waste treatment plant from the Aravali hills.
 
 It is feared that leachate being dumped in the Aravalis will pollute groundwater of South Delhi, Gurgaon and Faridabad.
