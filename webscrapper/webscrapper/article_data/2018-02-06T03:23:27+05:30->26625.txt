 Under Section 391 of the CrPC a court is empowered to take additional evidence in appeal, but it must satisfy itself that this evidence is necessary and also record reasons.
 
 If the Delhi Police’s application in this case is allowed then the evidence can be taken either by the HC itself through its joint registrar or it can direct the trial court to record it and send it to the high court.
 
 In its application the prosecution said certain facts regarding the forensic report of the voice samples need to be brought on record in the case to support its case. The bench, after arguments on the limited point if evidence can be allowed, wrapped up the hearings and is now expected to come out with its decision.
 
 Ahmed has appealed against his conviction in the September 19, 2008 encounter case for killing inspector M C Sharma and injuring two other policemen. He was awarded life imprisonment in 2013 by a session’s court for killing Sharma in an encounter, when a team of Delhi Police’s special cell raided the Batla House flat in Jamia Nagar on a tip-off.
