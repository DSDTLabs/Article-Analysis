NABHA: The owner of a gun house in Moga who had provided arms and ammunition to Nabha jail escapee   and his three accomplices — Manvir Sekhon, Sultan and Kulwinder — had also given them his own licensed, .12-bore rifle, police informed a court here on Saturday.

 Sekhon and his accomplices were arrested from Dhudike village in Moga on February 12. The gun house owner,  , was arrested two days later. The five accused were producted before a court on Saturday and were remanded in five-day police custody for further interrogation.
 
 Police informed the court that they learnt during the interrogation of the accused that Kiranpal had provided Sekhon and his associates five guns, including two numbered pistols that had been procured directly from a factory and had not yet been issued to any licence-holder, two country-made pistols, and his licensed rifle.
 
 Sources in the counter intelligence wing said that this had alarmed sleuths and they were wondering why Kiranpal had handed the gangsters his own gun, even though he knew Gurpreet had recently escaped from Nabha jail. Sources said the other guns could have been sold to the gangsters for cash, but Kiranpal handing them his own had made them suspicious of the intent behind it. “We are trying to know the exact motive behind this,” the source said.
 
 The source said investigators were also looking into the possibility of the gangsters being in touch with people behind a fake arms licence racket that had been busted in Fezorpur in 2015. “It is possible that those operating the racket could have been in touch with these gangsters, and were providing them with arms and ammunition,” the source added.
 
 While the police have arrested three Nabha jail escapees — Gurpreet, Harminder Singh Mintoo, and   — so far, the counter intelligence wing is still trying to track down Vicky Gonder, Aman Dhontia and  , who, too, escaped from the high-security prison on November 27 and are still at large.
