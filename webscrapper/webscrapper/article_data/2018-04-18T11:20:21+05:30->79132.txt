AHMEDABAD: A court in   on Tuesday sent two officials of   (GLDC) — K C   and Somabhai   — to 10-day police remand after the anti-corruption bureau (ACB) demanded their full remand on graft charges.

 On April 12, ACB recovered Rs 56.5 lakh in cash from five persons including the managing director from GLDC office. ACB submitted that huge amount of cash has been recovered and senior officers have been found misusing their positions to exploit poor farmers and people. There are two other officers who have been named in the complaint.
 
 Parmar’s advocate Amit Nair argued that he was not in the office when ACB conducted the raid. His office remains unlocked and anybody could have planted the money in his absence. It was because of his efficiency and credibility that he was granted an extension. Waghela also claimed innocence and opposed the remand application.
