GURUGRAM: The   ( ) held a meeting with residents of   on Thursday to address the infrastructure gaps in these areas.

 GMDA will provide master services like roads, water lines and sewage lines in these sectors in a phased manner. For this purpose, it has divided the new sectors into four groups — sectors 58 to 67, 68 to 80, 81 to 97, and 98 to 115. Of these, residents of sectors 68 to 80 will have to wait a little longer than the rest. These sectors will be the last to be taken up, due to pending concerns.
 
 TOI had recently launched a campaign ‘Give Gurugram Its Due’, highlighting the problems being faced by residents living in new sectors.
 
 Officials said the meeting on Thursday — the first in a series of meetings — was held for the residents living in sectors 58 to 67.
 
 GMDA CEO V Umashankar told TOI, “The meeting was called to look at infrastructure solutions, and various residents’ welfare associations, private developers and officials from various government departments were part of it. The key issues that were discussed in the meeting were external development charges ( ), 24-metre roads, panchayat revenue roads, and fixing responsibility of civic services in villages neighbouring the condominiums. Some issues related to water bills and private developers were also taken up.”
 
 Umashankar said a policy regarding 24-metre (internal) roads would be drafted soon and sent to Chandigarh for approval. However, as per the licence agreement, construction of 24-metre roads within the area licensed to a builder is the latter’s responsibility.
 
 “At present, there is no such policy and that is why we will need to draft a policy and get the process initiated at the state government-level. We will hold similar meetings with residents of sectors 81-95 and 96-115 in the coming days,” he said.
