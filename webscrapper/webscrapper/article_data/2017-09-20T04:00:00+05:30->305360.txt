Vadodara: A 19-year-old girl who was allegedly raped repeatedly by an elderly relative gave birth to a female child last week. But the rape survivor has decided that she will not accept the child and the officials are now trying to find a way out.

 The incident had come to light in May this year when the family found out that the girl was pregnant. After coming to know of pregnancy, the girl registered an offence with the Vejalpur police in Panchmahal district that began an investigation in the matter.
 
 Vejalpur police sub-inspector P M Judal said that the girl had alleged that the elderly relative had raped her on multiple occasions. “We arrested the accused and he is in the prison as an undertrial inmate. A chargesheet has also been filed against him,” he said. The police had collected the blood samples for DNA profiling of the accused. Judal said that the DNA profiling of the infant girl born to the survivor will also be conducted to ascertain if the accused was his biological father. The Vejalpur police had tried to get a blood sample for this on Tuesday, but has been called for the same on Wednesday now.
 
 Judal said that the survivor had approached the Gujarat high court with a plea to be allowed an abortion. An expert opinion of the SSG Hospital was sought in this regard, but the report stated that this was not advisable.
