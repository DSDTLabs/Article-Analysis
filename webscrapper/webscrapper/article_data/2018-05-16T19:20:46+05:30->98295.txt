 Later, police also arrested the store manager on the basis of a complaint, but he was released on bail. The complainant, Rakesh Kumar, said that the sharp object was stuck in the patty of the burger and injured his mouth and throat after he took a bite. The sample of the burger has been sent for forensic analysis. 
 
 Kumar went to the   outlet at 10am on May 13 while waiting for his brother. Kumar, a resident of Vishnu Garden, said that as he was on medication and feeling dizzy from hunger, so he went to the outlet and ordered a cheese burger.
 
 After a few bites, Kumar felt something in his mouth. “The moment I gulped it down there was a pain in my throat and chest. I spat out the rest of the burger and found a plastic foil-like substance used in sauce pouches,” said Kumar.
 
 He took the sample and showed it to the manager of the store. Kumar said the manager refused to accept that he found it in the burger and claimed that they had a record of cleanliness. “He refused to listen to my complaint and walked away to his counter. Following this, I called the PCR and informed them about the incident,” Kumar added.
 
 A police team reached the outlet and took Kumar for a medical examination, which confirmed an injury inside his throat. Kumar said that he had started bleeding by then and had a pain in his stomach. An FIR was registered for offering noxious food items and causing hurt due to negligence against Burger King and the manager in-charge.
 
 “We got to know about the incident and have initiated an inquiry into the allegations. Appropriate action will be taken as per the law. We are coordinating with the police regarding this,” said spokesperson of Burger King. Kumar is undergoing treatment at DDU hospital.
