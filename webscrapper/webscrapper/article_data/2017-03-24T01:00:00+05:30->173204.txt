  With Rajasthan reeling under simmering heat, Raaj told us that it was difficult for the actors to shoot, especially in the day time. "Agra wasn't that hot. The actors had a tough time shooting at the location. But we had to complete the shoot within the given time," said Raaj. 
 
  As per sources, the local police was deployed to make sure the shooting went on smoothly. However, a lot of fans flocked to the location, and a few even managed to click pictures with Sanjay. 
 
  This isn't the first time Sanjay is shooting for a film in Rajasthan. PK, Eklavya: The Royal Guard and Sher (not released yet) are also shot here.
