BENGALURU: Over the last three years,   on   has been undergoing a silent transformation. After signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the state’s department of archaeology, museums and heritage in 2015,   began on the 130-year-old main building spread over 45,000 square feet.

 
 The renovated building’s inauguration on Friday will possibly make it the first monument in the state’s history to be restored as per original specifications and without using modern technology.
 
 HS Srikanth, honorary secretary of Bowring Institute, said the club had taken all possible measures to remain true to the spirit and traditional methods of construction used in 1888. One of the ways of ensuring that was to source labourers, carpenters and other material from across the country. According to him, the decision to renovate the building was made after the teak wood rafters began to give way and seepage had begun to affect the building.
 
 “We travelled to the Thanjavur belt to get 38 labourers from temple artisan families who were still practising traditional methods of construction. Even the reconstruction of our three-layered Madras terrace required small inter-locking bricks made of special clay. We used over 20 lakh eggs in the lime mixture for plastering the pillars to make sure they have a traditional mirror finish,” Srikanth said.
 
 Eight traditional carpenters from a village near Trichy, who work with teak wood, were hired. The attention to detail and commitment to use age-old practices earned the institute laurels from the archaeology department.
 
 The entire restoration cost was around Rs 1 1crore.
