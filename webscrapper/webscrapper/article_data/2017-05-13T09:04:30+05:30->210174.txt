NEW DELHI:   were already out of reckoning for IPL play-offs before Friday's match against Rising Pune Supergiant but their captain   said that his side wanted to win as many matches as possible.

 "It was important to keep winning, we wanted to put up a good show and win. It is always good to win, as simple as that," Khan said after his side beat Pune by seven runs.
 
 "This was a different kind of wicket, we were aiming for 170. 180-190 would be a bonus. We always knew spinners will be in play. We've always been in the game," he said.
 
 "The schedule in a way should have worked in our favour," he added.
 
 Asked about his gem of a delivery, the first ball of the Pune run chase, which dismissed  , the Delhi captain said," "The length which I hit was perfect and Rahane committed to the stroke."
 
 RPS captain   said that losing wickets at crucial times contributed to his side's loss.
 
 "We probably let a few too many runs in the field. 160 was par. Losing wickets at important times hurt us," he said.
 
 "We will take it a game at a time at the moment. You get down to the crunch time, you have to win some games. Every game is a final. We played some pretty good cricket, you can't win every game."
