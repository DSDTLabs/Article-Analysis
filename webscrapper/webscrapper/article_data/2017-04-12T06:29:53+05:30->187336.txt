 The ‘great achievement’ has come against the reported cumulative loss of Rs 419 crore incurred by this apex institution in the   the years due to ‘corruption, inefficiency and splurge’, the minister told reporters, adding that the revival was possible thanks to various measures taken by the government after taking cooperatives and employees into trust.

 “Among the nine units, except three including Triveni, Neethi and Susrusha Hightech Lab, the rest have made a profit,” he added.
 
 The minister also announced the launch of 250 student markets across the state, where products of noted companies and platforms like Kudumbashree will be available at 20% discount . “As many as 24 new e-Triveni stores will be added to the existing four, for which the government has allocated Rs 1.85 crore as subsidy,” he said, adding that 2,000 Neethi outlets and 1,500 Neethi medical stores will be established to facilitate online purchase.
