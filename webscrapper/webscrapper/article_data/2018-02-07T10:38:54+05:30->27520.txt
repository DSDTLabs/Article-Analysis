LUDHIANA: In a major attempt to boost sports culture at the ground level, the   has given a free hand to wrestling, weight-lifting, and boxing coaches to enrol many deserving players in the   Sports Department Day Scholar and Residential Scheme, so that the state produces more national and international medallists.

 Kartar Singh Sahmbay, assistant to deputy director of Punjab Sports Department, said: “After observing continuous growth in wrestling, and weight-lifting sports, the department has directed coaches to enrol as many deserving players as possible, so that everyone can get easy coaching, diet, and equipment to fulfil their ambitions in sports. Earlier, limited seats were given to players of wrestling, weight-lifting, and boxing, but this time, the department has not followed any criteria to enrol players in their scheme. This time, the sports department has opened its doors to players who could not attend the trials for the scheme held last week, as players can give trials to their respective coaches at any point of time, and if he/she is deserving, then the department will enrol them on a priority basis.”
 
 Wrestling coach   stated: “This time, higher authorities have given us simple instructions to bring all deserving players in the scheme, so that Punjab’s medals tally in the national games increases.”
