AHMEDABAD: City police on Sunday gave final shape to the security scheme of the VVIPs, including PM   and foreign delegates. The cops have assigned the responsibilities for various stretches of the road to specific teams.

  City police officials said that a notification has been issued declaring various stretches leading to   as ‘No Parking and No Stop’ zones. The officials said that there is no specific time for closing the roads but there is no major diversion planned.
 
 With threat of ‘protesters’ high, state police have formed 20 special teams that have been deployed at various routes leading to Gandhinagar. Officials said that they are taking no chance and would initiate action if a person or vehicle enters the non-designated zones of the capital as a matter of precaution. The teams are equipped with special gear, they added. There would be 14 bomb disposal squads deployed at and around the venue of VGGIS along with dog squads. The officials also remarked on ‘corporate look’ of the khaki force as many of the personnel and officers would be donning suits and blazers primarily inside the venues. 
 
 While the state police denied any specific inputs about the event, Maharashtra police had issued a warning to the Gujarat police about a possible terror strike after a find of explosives. Likewise, the officials are also keeping an eye on recent advisories issued by Israel that cautioned Israelis on India tour, latest about ‘imminent terrorist attacks’ in India’s south-west.
