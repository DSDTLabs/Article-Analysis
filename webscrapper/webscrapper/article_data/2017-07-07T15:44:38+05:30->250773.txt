 The 28-year-old revealed some of her male co-actors have even taken pay cuts to make sure she gets the equal money as them. In an interview, she said, "In my career so far, I've needed my male co-stars to take a pay cut so that I may have parity with them. And that's something they do for me because they feel it's what's right and fair."
 
 "That's something that's also not discussed, necessarily that our getting equal pay is going to require people to selflessly said, 'That's what's fair.'" 
 
 She continued, "If my male co-star, who has a higher quote than me but believes we are equal, takes a pay cut so that I can match him, that changes my quote in the future and changes my life. And this is  's feminism, and I love it she is equality, man: equality, equality, equality." 
 
 The actress said her male counter parts have not done it to show that "women are this and men are that" but because they believe in equality. "And that's really what I've been so grateful for with male co-stars when I've been in a similar-size role in films."
