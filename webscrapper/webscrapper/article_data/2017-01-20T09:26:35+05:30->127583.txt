INDORE: The city schools may stick to winter timing beyond January 22. The district administration had earlier extended winter timing from Jan 15 to 22. 

 Looking at the unfavorable weather conditions that the students have to face commuting to the schools early in the morning, the administration had sent notice to the private schools as well as the government schools to continue with the winter school timings till January 22. However, the schools in the city agreed that the winter timings must continue till the weather becomes favourable for the students to commute easily.
 
 "For now, we will be following the winter timing as asked by the administration and wait for further information. Even if we do not get any instructions from the authorities and the weather remains the same, we might plan to continue with the winter timing till weather becomes less hostile," said  , chairman  .
 
 Meanwhile, the   that took place in UP on Thursday also became a reason for parents to get anxious. "The bus drivers and auto drivers are often seen rash driving and especially in the morning, when it is foggy or hazy. It becomes difficult to see increasing the chances of accidents. Thankfully the schools are continuing winter school timings," said a worried parent, Sanjay Patidar.
