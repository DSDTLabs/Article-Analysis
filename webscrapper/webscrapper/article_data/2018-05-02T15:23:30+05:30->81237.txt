  ‘Bharat Ane Nenu’ has been received well by critics and audience alike. The film charts the journey of a London-bred man Bharat, played by Mahesh Babu, who returns to India after the death of his father, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. However, when circumstances force him to don the recently vacated seat, how he copes with it forms the crux of the tale. Kiara Advani plays the role of his love interest, Vasumathi in the film. Mahesh Babu had previously called this role his career’s best performance. The music by DSP too, was received well before the film, and is said to be one of the highlights.
