RAIPUR: Chief minister Raman   on Friday said his government launched a crackdown against the   movement only after the stir started creating divisions - going against the spirit of the constitution. "If the tribal communities are following their centuries old traditions, it is no problem. But, it (Pathargadi) began to cross the red line," he said, adding, that not allowing people to enter the village, detaining government staff are not in line with the constitutional provisions. 

 Talking to reporters on the eve of his Vikas Yatra, he said Pathargadi movement began in the neighbouring Jharkhand is now on the wane. It started from   district.
 
 Replying to a question about the prospects of his party in the coming assembly elections, Singh said, "We are confident that the party would perform much better than the 2008 and 2013 elections and achieve the target of winning at least 65 seats set by party president Amit Shah."
