All the girls who swooned over   have one more reason to lose their heart to him. Gosling, who won the Best Actor in a Motion Picture (Comedy or Musical) for 'La La Land' at the ongoing Golden Globes Awards 2017, gave a heartfelt speech when he accepted his award on the stage.
 
 The actor thanked his girlfriend,  , for holding the fort while he worked on the musical. 'I just would like to try and thank one person properly, and say that while I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one the best experiences I've ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer,' Gosling said in his speech. 'If she hadn't taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. Sweetheart, thank you,' he said amidst thunderous applause.
