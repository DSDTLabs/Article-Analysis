GANDHINAGAR: The   and   (AAP) have demanded the resignation of the BJP Gujarat unit president   and demanded action against him over a non-bailable warrant issued against him by a Mumbai court, in a cheque bounce case.

 Vaghani’s partnership firm Eva Group had a dispute with a Mumbai-based company in a property transaction.
 
  Nishit Vyas, Gujarat Congress spokesman and general secretary said: “It seems like the BJP has set a qualification for leaders to have the maximum number of cases. The BJP national president was sent to jail in a fake encounter case and state BJP president Jitu Vaghani faces a non-bailable warrant in a forgery case. The BJP must take his resignation and take action.”
 
 Harshil Nayak, AAP spokesman said that, “The BJP’s double standards have been exposed by the non-bailable warrant issued against its state president Jitu Vaghani. Gujarat police, which harasses AAP workers every day, failed to even act on the Mumbai court’s non-bailable warrant. Gujarat police must learn from Delhi Police and act according to the law. The BJP must ask for Vaghani’s resignation.”
 
 Reacting to the Congress and AAP, Vaghani said: “Congress and AAP, whom the people have rejected everywhere, have no right to talk about me. I have nothing to hide. I have already said that it was a business dispute and has nothing to do with my political life. The case was fabricated against me as I did not even issue a cheque to the concerned party. I have had 25 years of public life and not a single allegations have been made against me. This is a Congress motivated issue and I have already produced all the evidence in the court. In an election year, we are prepared to face any such low-level political attacks from the opposition.”
