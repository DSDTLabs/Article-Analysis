NEW DELHI: Controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik-led   (IRF) today approached the   to challenge the ban imposed on the NGO by the Centre.

 The court, while accepting the plea, directed the Centre to produce relevant record leading to its declaration banning the IRF with immediate effect.
 Restricting the petition to the issue of immediate ban, the Bench posted the matter for further hearing on Tuesday.
 
 On November 15, the Central government had banned the IRF for five years after declaring it as an "unlawful association" under the anti-terror laws, and the NIA followed up with raids on its premises in Mumbai on November 19.
 
 According to the Home Ministry, Dr Naik has allegedly made many provocative speeches and engaged in terror propaganda.
 
  has also registered criminal cases against Naik for his alleged involvement in radicalisation of youths and luring them into terror activities, officials said.
 
 He came under the scanner of the security agencies after Bangladeshi newspaper 'Daily Star' reported that one of the perpetrators of the July 1 terror attack in Dhaka, Rohan Imtiaz, ran propaganda on Facebook in 2015 quoting Naik.
 
 Since then Naik has not returned to India and has been mostly travelling and preaching in Africa and Middle East, though he addressed the Mumbai media once via teleconference in July.
 
 The   (ED) lodged a case of suspected money-laundering against   and IRF in December.
 
 The NIA had filed cases against Naik under the UAPA for allegedly promoting enmity between groups on religious and racial grounds, and raided over a dozen offices, residential premises, his Peace TV offices, and other locations, besides freezing a bank account of his NGO.
