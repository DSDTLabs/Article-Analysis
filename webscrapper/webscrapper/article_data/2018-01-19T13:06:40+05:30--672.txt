NAGPUR: Even as citizens are paying through their nose for power,   has proposed another tariff hike for coming three years. The hike has been necessitated as MSEDCL did not earn the expected amount of revenue in 2015-16 and 2016-17 while its expenditure was more than that estimated by   (MERC). 

 Alarmingly, this trend is expected to continue in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. MSEDCL has not made the petition public going against the established norm.
 
 According to the recent tariff hike petition filed by MSEDCL, the discom earned about Rs9,700 crore less than that estimated in 2015-16 and 2016-17. It is expected to earn Rs7,950 crore less than expected in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. While MSEDCL has not stated any reason for lower revenue in its petition, power experts say it is due to failure of the company in curbing rampant power theft and due to lack of action on defaulters. Farmers are the biggest defaulters as most of them do not pay power bills.
 
 A power expert said instead of cracking down on theft, MSEDCL tries to pass off the loss as unpaid farm power bills. “This is done by inflating power consumption of farm pumps. A three-member committee of state government had proved this fact recently but the report was pushed under the carpet. Unless MSEDCL is able to reduce power pilferage, its revenue will not increase and power tariff hikes will be needed in coming years too,” he added.
 
 
  
  
 
 
 Pratap Hogade, a member of the committee, had estimated that inflated farm pump bills are issued to the tune of Rs5,000 crore every year. This amount is actually the loss caused due to power pilferage.
 
 Another reason for hike in power tariff is increase in power purchase expenses as compared to that sanctioned by MERC. While the actual expenses were less by Rs408 crore in 2015-16, they were Rs72 crore higher in 2016-17. In 2017-18 the expenses are expected to be more by a whopping Rs2,230 crore, 2018-19 - Rs2,000 crore and 2019-20 - Rs785 crore.
 
 The operation and maintenance (O&M) expenses that include expenditure on employees, repair and maintenance and administration, were also more than sanctioned in 2015-16 and 2016-17. MSEDCL management has no intention of reducing them and expects them to be higher than MERC estimate in 2017-18 and coming two fiscals.
 
 Even though MSEDCL is deep in the red, the company officials and employees have not bothered to reduce frivolous expenses. MSEDCL also indulges in unnecessary litigation and wastes lakhs on lawyers’ fees.
