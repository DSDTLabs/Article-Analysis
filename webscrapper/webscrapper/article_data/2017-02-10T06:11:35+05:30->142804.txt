Alwar: Two leopards from   (STR) were shifted to Jaipur’s zoo on Thursday. The residents of   village were living under fear following deaths of four persons in   attack in the past six months.

 Now, to provide relief to the villagers, the STR administration tranquillized two leopards found near the affected area and caged them before shifting them to Jaipur. Over 40 villages adjoining STR had been living in constant fear of attack from the leopard.
 
 STR administration had deployed five different teams to nab the leopards.
 
 The teams used goats as bait for the leopard. In past three days, they had placed 40 cages to trap leopards but none was trapped till the last report came in adding to the woes of the villagers. But, on Thursday, they got the success. When leopards ran towards the goat to kill them, a team of doctors and STR teams tranquillized the leopards and caged them. They were kept in two different cages. After the shifting of the leopards, villagers of the area along with STR officials took a sigh of relief. It was a difficult situation to handle for the STR officials as they had to make announcements in affected villages to stay indoors in the morning and evening hours to ward off such leopard attacks on the villagers.
 
 Villagers said two days ago, two women had died in leopard’s attack when they were doing their routine activities in their agriculture field along with a dozen villagers sustained injuries in the attack have forced the villagers to stay indoors.
 
 Chief conservator of forest RS   said that for the past three days, teams were on their job to rescue the two leopards. Now, on Thursday, they got the success for shifting them to Jaipur’s zoo.
 
 Some of the worst affected villages includes   Bhal, Kadalanka, Pratapgarh, Surjagarh, Todi, Pawatsar. Kyaru and Jhiri. These are located in the interiors along adjoining the forest reserve.
