INDORE: As temperature is rising, it is not only humans but also animals and birds, who are feeling the heat. Animal lovers in city have now started keeping earthen pots, cemented tanks and bowls filled with water outside their homes and in gardens around their colonies for them. 

 Pets’ owners are giving special care to their animals by keeping their beds close to coolers and ACs. 
 
 “My dog is quite furry and he gets irritated due to the heat, which is constantly increasing. During summer we let him sleep on floor right in front of cooler. We also make sure to keep him well hydrated,” said a resident of   area  .
 
 For stray animals too, people are ensuring special arrangements for upcoming hot months. An animal lover’s group in the city is placing old matkas near small shops, where stray animals can drink water from it in their locality.
 
 “In Vijay Nagar I have personally distributed around 50 such matkas and bowls for animals and birds. We started this around a month ago and have been sensitising people about animals. We also urged them to refill water in the utensils kept by them,” said  . 
 
 While these are the efforts being made at small scale, a shelter home for animals at Vijay Nagar is being specially renovated for summers so that around 150 animals stationed there could stay comfortably. 
 
 “Out of the 3000 square feet area of the shelter home, which is covered with tin, we are trying to cover around 1500- 2000 square feet with false ceiling. Till now only one room has been done, and there is a lot more to do. Lack of fund is a big problem because of which we are unable to maintain the shelter home for summers with fans and coolers,” said Animal and Bird Welfare Society Sapna  . 
 
 While some fans and coolers have already been set up at the shelter, the need for more such coolers, which can cool a large area is needed. Chourasia said that she had earlier put her personal coolers at the shelter, but they broke down due to wear and tear.
