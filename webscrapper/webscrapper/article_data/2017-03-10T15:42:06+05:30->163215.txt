PANAJI:   on Thursday said that if it doesn’t win the elections with a comfortable majority, it would not align with other political parties to form the state government. According to party insiders,   has begun to eye the upcoming  , to try and build its base at the grassroots governance level.

 “If we are unable to form the government on our own, then we are willing to sit in the opposition, but we will not support any other parties in government formation,” state party convener and chief ministerial candidate   said, while speaking to TOI. Exit polls have suggested AAP could bag a maximum of four seats in the state assembly elections, but local political observers said that the party was unlikely to gain more than two seats.
 
 Gomes added that the functioning of the party would continue even after the results are declared on March 11, and would shift its focus on panchayat elections, irrespective of whether the party captured significant constituencies in the assembly elections or not. The executive party members, including all the candidates, will meet on Saturday evening to take stock of the election results.
 
 “We had a meeting with all our volunteers where we took several decisions, including a decision to back suitable candidates in the coming panchayat elections. The party has decided to back younger, educated and clean candidates in the panchayat elections, especially women candidates. There is a possibility of some panchayats, where we could be fielding only women candidates, so we have asked our volunteers to scout for good candidates,” Gomes said.
 
 AP volunteers said there was a possibility of AAP general secretary and Goa in-charge Pankaj Gupta arriving in Goa ahead of the election results.
