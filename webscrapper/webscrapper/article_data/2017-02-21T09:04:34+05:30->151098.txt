NASHIK: Police seized Indian Made Foreign   (IMFL) from a vehicle in the Panchavati area on Monday, barely 24 hours before the city goes to poll. 

 Police suspect that the liquor was meant for distribution among voters so that they favour a specific candidate in the poll fray. 
 
 Senior inspector (Sarkarwada police station) Sitaram Kolhe said he received a tip-off around 12:30am that a white coloured multi utility vehicle (MUV) was moving around in the area in a suspicious way.
 
 “I alerted the detection branch unit of the police station. A team was sent to track the vehicle down. A checkpost was set up near Chopra lawns and the vehicle was intercepted around 1:00am” Kolhe said. 
 
 The boxes of three brands were stacked up in the rear portion of the vehicle and the consignment was worth Rs 62,000. “We seized the liquor and the car. We arrested three persons travelling in the vehicle at that time,” the officer said. 
 
 The three arrested — Mahesh Bharti (31), Bhilla Pawar (51) and Shivram Bhavsar (55) — are all residents of the Panchavati area. 
 
 Sources in the police said the department was keeping a tab on liquor being smuggled into the city for distribution before the polling day. 
 
 A few days ago, a flying squad of the excise department’s Nashik division had confiscated 26 cartons of IMFL from an ambulance at Indiranagar underpass.
 
 The consignment, priced at around Rs 90,000, was on its way to the   and Nagar Haveli. Department sources said the price of the seized liquor in Maharashtra could be over Rs 2 lakh .
 
 The driver of the ambulance, Amitabh Shardul, was arrested and the police were questioning him to find out for whom he was transporting the consignment.
