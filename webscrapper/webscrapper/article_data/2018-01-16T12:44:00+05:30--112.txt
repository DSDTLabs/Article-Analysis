Actress   said she there was a time when she had just 'five percent chance' of surviving. It was when she suffered brain haemorrhage in 2001.

  
  
 
 Reportedly, Stone, 59, told that she had to re-learn 'everything' when her life was 'wiped out' as a result of the medical condition.
 
 The actress said: "There was about a five per cent chance of me living. My whole life was wiped out. Others aren't that interested in a broken person. I was alone.
 
 "I'm sure I seemed peculiar coming through this all these years, and I didn't want to tell everybody what was happening because, you know, this is not a forgiving environment. I'm so grateful to have this. The chance of my having it was so slim."
 
 While the   star is back in the film industry again, she still has some alone time and likes to spend some of it talking to her tree.
 
 "I talk to my tree... it's pretty fabulous, it smells so great," said Stone, who has adopted sons Roan, 17, Laird, 12, and Quinn, 11.
 
 She said she has 'seen it all' in the entertainment industry over the last 40 years, and is pleased to see women are becoming more 'empowered'.
 
 Asked if she has ever been in a position when she has felt  , she laughed and replied: "Oh, I've been in this business for 40 years. Can you imagine the business I stepped into 40 years ago?
 
 "Looking like I look, from nowhere, Pennsylvania? I didn't come here with any protection. I've seen it all. We're starting to acknowledge our own gifts as women and not think that we have to behave as men in order to be empowered or powerful or valuable," she said.
