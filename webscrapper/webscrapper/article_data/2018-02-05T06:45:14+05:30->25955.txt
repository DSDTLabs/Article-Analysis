AHMEDABAD: Hotel Dwarkadheesh on SP Ring Road near Ambli, which was in news recently after two of its   by four   for refusing food at 3.45 am on January 31, was asked to   on Saturday. 

 The hotel owner put up a notice board outside the eatery mentioning that the inspector of Sarkhej police station threatened to slap cases on the eatery if it was not closed. The reason cited by police is lack of police permission required for the operation. Police didnâ€™t give any reason why lack of permission of the eatery was not noticed until now.
 
 Four constables of Bopal police station - Mukeshdan Gadhvi, Pradyumnasinh, Sadik and Harpalsinh - had approached the eatery at 3.45 am and had demanded food. When Gaurav Chaudhary, 19, and his brother Ankit, who were present at the eatery, showed inability to provide food and offered tea, the police staff allegedly demanded Rs 10,000. When the brothers again wrung their hands they were brutally beaten up and made to do sit-ups. 
 
 While the phone of the eatery owner, Tarunsinh Zala, was switched off on Sunday, PR Ramani, inspector of Sarkhej police station, told media that the eatery was not being singled out.
