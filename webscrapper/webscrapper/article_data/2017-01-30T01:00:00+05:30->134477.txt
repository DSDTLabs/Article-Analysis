 Members of Karni Sena vandalised the sets of 'Padmavati' in Jaipur and assaulted Bhansali over an alleged intimate scene in the film between   and Alauddin Khilji. Bhansali clarified that there is no such scene and decided to cancel the shoot in the city. The violence on the film’s set resulted in the film fraternity rallying behind SLB, calling for an end to ‘goondagiri’ and ‘politics of silence’.
 
 
  
  
 
 This desi interpretation of Romeo and Juliet was in trouble right from the beginning. Bhansali was forced to change the title from 'Ramleela' to 'Ram-Leela', and then to   to avoid offending religious groups. The film also angered the Rajput community in Ahmedabad, who said that the film misinterpreted the community and should be banned. The film was also banned in Uttar Pradesh since the title had the words ‘Ram-Leela’ and ‘Raasleela’.
