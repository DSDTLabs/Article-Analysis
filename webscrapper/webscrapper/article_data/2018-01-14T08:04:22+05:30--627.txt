DHARAMSHALA: A day after the opposition has targeted the newly-elected   government in the state assembly over RSS interference in the administration, CM   visited the Sangh office on Friday, giving the   more fodder to attack it.

 On Thursday, CLP leader   had asked BJP government on the floor of the House to keep control on the interference of RSS in its functioning. “It seems that you (CM) are at the steering wheel but somebody else is trying to change the gears of your vehicle,” Agnihotri had said. The CM had replied to this in the House that the Congress members need not worry as the control of the vehicle was with him only and it would take everyone to their destination. Later in the day, Thakur paid a visit to RSS office at Guptganga, Kangra about 20 km from here.
 
 On Saturday, Agnihotri said that they have already raised this issue in the House. There are too many power centres around the CM, he added.
 
 When contacted, RSS leaders refused to give any details of CM’s visit. “CM was here to ask after Dr Satyapal, one of our senior members, who was not keeping well. There is nothing more to it,” was all an RSS leader was willing to say.
 
 Some BJP members claimed that even they were unaware of Thakur’s plan to visit RSS office.
