Actor-director   will be seen in a crucial role in an upcoming Tamil film  , which will have veteran actress Jayaprada returning to Tamil cinema after 10 years. The film, directed by Malayalam filmmaker MA Nishad is about a water dispute that arises between the people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala because of a well. 

  “The film is set in 1956 when the state of Kerala was formed. As the border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala is drawn, a well becomes the source of conflict with people of both the states claiming it to be theirs. How a resolution to the issue is found is what the film is all about,” says Parthiban, who adds that the film uses this conflict as an analogy for the Mullaiperiyar issue between the two neighbouring states. 
 
 “A Malayalam director is making a film that supports the cause of Tamil and this is what made me take up this film,” informs the actor. His character is the one who makes people realise that they can find a resolution to their problem instead of fighting over it, while Jayaprada’s character is that of the resident of the house in which the well exists.
 
 The actor is glad to be acting alongside Jayaprada, whom he had worked with when he was an assistant director. “I was working with   sir when he directed the Hindi remake of Oru Kaidhiyin Diary, Aakhree Raasta with Amitabh Bachchan and Jayaprada. Now, it feels great to be her co-star,” he gushes. 
 
 The film also has   and   in supporting roles.
