Bengaluru: A 29-year-old man was pushed to death from the first floor of his Girinagar house on Friday night by unidentified persons for tossing a plastic trash bag onto the road.

 R Devaraj, who worked as an ambulance driver in a private hospital here, was from Tiptur, Tumakaru district. He stayed in a single-bedroom house on the first floor near PES College.
 
 On Friday night, Devaraj had reportedly bought food from a hotel and invited his friends Sunil and Santosh, both taxi drivers, for dinner. They had a drink and after dinner, the friends left and Devaraj cleared the food packets and leftover food, shoved it into a plastic bag and reportedly threw it onto the road.
 
 Police said three persons chatting on the road chided him for being careless. A verbal fight broke out and Devaraj alerted his friends about the argument and they returned. The three objectors went to his room and pushed him to the ground. Devaraj suffered head injuries and died on the spot. The trio reportedly fled the spot.
 
 Based on a complaint filed by Sunil, police said the altercation between Devaraj and the trio lasted over 10 minutes and none of the neighbours, including the house owner, intervened. “We’ve taken up a case under Section 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) under the Indian Penal Code and are searching for the accused,” police said, adding: “Prima facie, it’s not an intentional killing. The accused and Devaraj were pushing each other when he fell over.”
 
 A senior police officer said they receive calls about tiffs about trash disposal every day. “Almost every locality witnesses fights between residents about trash. Some people dump their garbage by the roadside or in front of other buildings. This is the first incident in recent times that a person has died over garbage,” he added.
