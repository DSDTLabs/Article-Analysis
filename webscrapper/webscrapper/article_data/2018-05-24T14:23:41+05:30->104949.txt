TRICHY: Road users are in for a new experience while crossing   as the Urban Local Body (ULB) is experimenting with   by painting a select ones with red and white stripes instead of the standard black and white.   has claimed that this unconventional method is being done for the first time in Tamil Nadu to make arterial roads safe for pedestrians. 

 The move was already in place as part of smart city project in Nagpur, Maharashtra. “Painting the speed breakers in white and red stripes was to differentiate speed breakers from zebra crossings. This move will certainly pressure vehicles to approach the stretch carefully. The attempt made at Bharathidasan Salai was on an experimental basis,” a senior official with Trichy Corporation said.
 
 As per the Indian Roads Congress (IRC) standards, it is said that speed breakers were permitted to be painted in white and black alternative stripes and on rare occasions yellow stripes were entertained. In Trichy, Bharathidasan Salai remains an arterial stretch dotted with government offices, hospitals and city police offices and the speed breaker outside the ULB office has been helping pedestrians cross safely for a long time. As the road is being maintained by Ponmalai Zone of Trichy Corporation, the civic body as a part of revamping safety parameters, painted the speed breaker with white and red stripes.
