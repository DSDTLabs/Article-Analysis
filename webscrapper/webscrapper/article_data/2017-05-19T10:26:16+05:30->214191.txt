INDORE: Celebrating International   Day, authorities at central museum in Indore were told on Thursday to organise seminars, workshops, exhibitions and art camps.

 As part of the celebrations, a seminar series was organised at the Central museum which was attended by many archaeological and history enthusiasts from the city.
 
 The main speakers for the event were historians Jagdish Chandra Upadhyay and Rajendra Singh, environmentalist Janak Palta McGilligan and noted photographer from the city  .
 
 All the guests for the programme expressed their views on the rich legacy of Indian culture and how it was a matter of pride for all Indian citizens.
 
 Speakers also suggested Indore’s central museum authorities on ways they could increase the footfall at the museum and spread awareness among people regarding the rich heritage of Malwa region.
 
 Deriving an example from the revival of Sirpur Lake, photographer Bhalu Mondhe said that to draw the attention of people towards the museum, constant activities must be organised as well as publicity.
 
 “Today there are various kinds of museums in the country that display a collection of rare items. In Indore many individuals have huge collections of rare items such as coins, stamps and letters, which can be put up for exhibition. The government must pay attention to this and spend money to reach out to such people,” Mondhe said.
 
 The programme was organised by the Madhya Pradesh directorate of archaeology, archives and museums, in which people from all age groups participated. Youngsters learned about ancient sculptures and other rare artefacts kept at the museum and also took pictures with them.
