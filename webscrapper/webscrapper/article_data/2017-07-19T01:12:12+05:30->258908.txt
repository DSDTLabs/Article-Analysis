MUMBAI: A special court on Tuesday rejected the   plea submitted by a teenager who is accused of robbing and pushing a 24-year-old off the platform in front of a running train at   railway  .

 On December 6, 2016, the victim, Sapna Shukla, who worked with a city based bank, was standing at Kurla railway station to catch a train. The prosecution alleged that the 17-year-old teenager snatched her chain and when she turned around to face him, he pushed her off the platform in front of an oncoming train. Shukla was run over and killed immediately. 
 
 The teenager in his bail plea told the court that he has been falsely implicated in the case. Advocate Abha Singh who represented the victimâ€™s father BN Singh filed an intervention application. 
 
 Opposing the plea, she said that the entire statement of the teenager is false and a deliberate attempt to mislead the court.
