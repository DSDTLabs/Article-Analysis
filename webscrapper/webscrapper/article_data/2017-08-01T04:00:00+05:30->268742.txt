Vadodara: A team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) along with Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services (VFES) conducted search operations in Mahisagar River for Parth Chauhan, a student of Parul University, who slipped into the river on Sunday afternoon, but to no success.

 Chauhan and his friends had gone into the fast flowing water for a swim, when he and his friend Amit Patel were pulled in a whirlpool. Patel managed to swim out of it but Chauhan, a final year mechanical engineering at Waghodia-based Parul University, got pulled in it.
 
 Fire department sources said that the NDRF team joined the search operations after Chauhan’s parents insisted. Chauhan, who hails from Lunawada in Mahisagar district, had gone to Sindhrot along with his three friends on Sunday. The divers of fire department did not undertake search operation in the river due to high water current and low visibility.
 
 They said that on Monday too water current was high due to which Chauhan might have been dragged away for several kilometres. 
 
 “We believe that the boy’s body will be found near Dabka village in Padra taluka as the water current there is slow therefore we are conducting search operations there,” said assistant fire officer Om Jadeja. Four teams including NDRF team searched the area on Monday.
 
 Officials said that they have identified at least seven spots in the river near Dabka where they believe they will find the body. Jadeja said that they will again start the search operations on Tuesday morning.
