It’s rare that the recreated version of a popular track is easily accepted. 'Mere  ', the first track from director Milan Luthria’s ' ', has registered a lot of views online and is poised to become a chartbuster. The song displays intense romance between   and Ileana D’Cruz’s characters and has a soulful melody that adds to the rustic feel of the film. Composer Tanishk Bagchi’s version amalgamates Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s original with new lyrics by Manoj Muntashir.

 Producer Bhushan Kumar feels that although it’s difficult to match the success of an original number, he’s happy with the response to the new version. “I have been wanting to work on Mere Rashke Qamar for about a year-and-a-half. When we were discussing a track that brings out the chemistry between Ajay and Ileana’s characters, I was sure it had to be Nusrat saab’s composition. I procured the rights and I’m thankful to Rahat for singing it,” he says.
 
 Milan, who has previously collaborated with the late maestro in ' ', is pleased to have his composition on the album. He considers it to be a heartfelt tribute from Rahat to his uncle, who trained the singer while Milan’s debut film was under production. The filmmaker sums up, “Within 24 hours of its launch, the song stunned us with its popularity online. I spoke to Ajay late at night. It was an emotional conversation about how Nusrat saab had found his way back into our lives.”
