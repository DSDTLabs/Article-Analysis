THIRUVANANTHAPURAM:   wishes to become a  . A transgender, she braved many odds to complete her master’s in   and joined the   with her name on the top of the rank list. But, with an ailing father and a mother who worked as a maid to make ends meet, Shyama has to earn a living through dance shows and comedy programmes. 

 Now, she has become the first recipient of the Rs 20,000 scholarship introduced by the state government as part of the transgender policy.
 
 “Right from my school days I was ridiculed for the way I walk and talk. During my adolescence, when I found out my gender issues, I even had to undergo counselling sessions to come out of the mental trauma. I went through all that only because I did not want to step aside just because I am a transgender. But even after all my efforts, I was denied a job because of the gender-insensitive society,” she said.
 
 But she says, though the state is the first to introduce the transgender policy, it came to a cropper in its implementation. “It has been two years since the policy was introduced to improve the health, education and living conditions of the transgender people,” said Shyama.
 
 During her first interview for the post of a teacher at a school in Kazhakkoottam in 2014, the reaction of the members of interview board, who ridiculed her for her looks and her behaviour, came as a shocker to her and even eroded her confidence to face another interview. She, however, is not ready to be sidelined. “I will either become a teacher or do research in literature,” she said.
