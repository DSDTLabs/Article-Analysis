VADODARA: A 56-six-year-old woman was attacked with a knife right outside her house in Punjan Tenement in Manjalpur early on Friday morning.

 The attacker also snatched her gold chain and fled along with two others. The victim Meena Patel suffered injuries on her ear and had to be hospitalized.
 
 “The attacker was already sitting in the compound. The moment Patel opened the door at around 4:45 am and walked out, he snatched her gold chain. When she tried to resist, he attacked her with a knife,” the police said.
 
 Her husband, who rushed out hearing her cries, chased him but the other two accomplices threw stones at him and fled. The 
 
 incidents of chain snatching are occurring regularly despite the police patrolling. The accused usually ride on motorbikes and target women who are walking alone in isolated spots. 
 
 Last month two women lost their gold chains in different incidents when they were targeted by chain-snatchers in Gorwa and Manjalpur area. Four days ago, a woman was duped in Makarpura by two persons who identified themselves as policemen. The accused took away her gold jewellery.
