The title track of director Shashank Khaitan’s ' ' is a tribute to Holi. Interestingly, 'Badri Ki Dulhania' is also the first Holi number for the lead actors, Varun Dhawan and  , though the latter had a montage scene of the festival in producer Karan Johar’s earlier offering, '2 States'. 

 Composed by Tanishq Bagchi, penned by Shabbir Ahmed and choreographed by Ganesh Acharya, the peppy track gives a feel of what the movie is all about. Picturised on a set specially built for the purpose, the song, which releases today, has the vibe of nautanki in small towns and how people come together to celebrate the festival. 
 
 Shashank says, “We’ve tried to treat the festival in a novel way — it’s not restricted to using pichkaris and throwing colours. We have used colours as part of the choreography, and there is a lot more dancing in our song.” 
 
 He adds, “While we’ve seen Varun do hardcore commercial stuff, this is the first time you’ll see Alia do such a dance number. Though she has done 'Radha On The Dance Floor' ('Student Of The Year'), which was a younger and cool number, she has a 90s’ look in 'Badri Ki Dulhania'.”
