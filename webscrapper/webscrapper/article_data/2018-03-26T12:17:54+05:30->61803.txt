PANAJI: Chief minister  , who will commence the second phase of his treatment on Monday, took to Facebook to warn people not to fall prey to rumours about his health floating around on social media. 

 Calling the chief minister ’s condition “very good”, state legislative assembly speaker Pramod Sawant, who spoke to him on Sunday evening, said Parrikar would undergo treatment for three days and then would be discharged after two weeks. “After that, he will return to Goa,” Sawant said. 
 
 The verified   page on Sunday rubbished rumours regarding Parrikar’s health. It stated that many mischievous messages were floating on social media, attributing them to the CM’s authorship. 
 
 “Such messages are not authentic and mischievous. All messages will be communicated directly by him or through his verified social media handles only.”
 
  
  
 Parrikar, who formed a three-member cabinet panel to run the government in his absence, is keeping track of governance at home. “I told him that the administration is functioning properly and there is no problem,” Sawant told TOI. 
 
 Earlier, Union minister for commerce and industry Suresh Prabhu had on Saturday said that Parrikar was responding well. “Spoke to @manoharparrikar who is responding well to treatment in the US hospital. Wished him speedy recovery, early return home to lead Goa,” he tweeted.
 
 Parrikar has been ailing from February this year. He was admitted to Lilavati Hospital, Mumbai, on February 15, after being diagnosed with pancreatitis. He was discharged after a week and returned to Goa to present the budget on February 21. 
 
 After spending a couple of days at home, he was admitted to Goa Medical College and Hospital. Later, he was again admitted to Lilavati Hospital on March 5, from where he was taken to the US, based on advise from doctors at the Mumbai hospital.
