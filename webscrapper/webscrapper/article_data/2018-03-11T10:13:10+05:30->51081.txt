Agra: 2016   Champion and two-time Indian National Champion racer   was forced to retire from the prestigious   being held  , Lonato, Italy, after a relapsed rib injury prevented him from progressing past the second free practice session.

 Trofeo Andrea Margutti, named in the honour of a 15-year old Italian racing driver, who passed away in a karting accident, had 250 plus drivers taking part from 30 countries in this year’s edition. Racing in the colours of the   in the OKJ category, there were 48 drivers in Shahan’s category and it would have been a super-competitive outing for the Indian.
 
 The 13-year old from Agra was getting up to speed during the second practice session, posting some quick times and while it was clear he would have been extremely competitive; the rib pain was coming back with a vengeance – legacy of a major karting accident he had suffered during his 2017 National Championship campaign.
 
 The on-site medical team tried medication and painkillers with little result and after detailed consultations with the experts it was clear that Shahan couldn’t have possibly make it through the long weekend with hundreds of laps in track time still ahead. It was a real shame given the pace and consistency Shahan had showed until that point.
 
 In a bigger disappointment though, due to long recovery period prescribed, Shahan was also forced to pull out of the   after being the only driver officially representing India after receiving nomination from FMSCI.
 
 " I was looking forward to flying the Indian tricolour in this coveted and prestigious race and the CIK-FIA Academy Trophy later this year so its indeed difficult to come to terms with the fact that after all this preparation and hard work we need to sit it out”, commented a clearly downcast Shahan.
 
 Sports medicine specialists say that it might take anywhere between 10-12 weeks of rest for Shahan’s injuries to heal completely and return to the track.
