Bhopal: The-6 km long stretch of  , where a 22-year-old youth, who had gone for a long drive on his 400 cc bike along with his two friends died on Friday, has been used in the past by bike enthusiasts as ‘a spot’ to show off their bike stunts.

 During the night, the wide road-which otherwise sees heavy traffic- is deserted. This allures the young bikers, who use it to perform stunts on their bikes. A number of youths have lost their lives while speeding their bikes on this avenue. There are no CCTVs on the road, except on squares, which seems to have emboldened the youths. At present, the CCTVs are fixed at four spots: Retghat Square (where VIP Road starts), at Karbala Square, at Khanugaon Square and at Lalghati Square, informed Anil Bajpai, SHO Koh-e-Fiza police station. Soon, two CCTVs will be fitted near Raja Bhoj Statue and Karbala Square to keep a check on the speeding vehicles on the road.
 
 “You can create fear in the minds of youth of getting caught for over speeding by fitting cameras. But to really motivate them against driving at high speeds there is a need to spread awareness about the ill-effects of such incidents,” Bajpai said. DIG Dharmendra Choudhary said the department would try to make arrangements for CCTVs on the VIP Road.
 
 Twenty-two-year-old Altaf Ur Rehman, son of a well-known tailor Iqbal Ur Rehman in Ibramhimpura, had gone out tripling on his 400 cc Bajaj Dominar bike along with his friends Arbaz and Danish. Altaf was riding pillion, when all of a sudden, his friend applied disk brakes and their bike skid. Altaf almost flew and hit a BMC dustbin hanging from a pole beside the road between Raja Bhoj statue and Karbala. Adding to the misery, someone even stole his mobile and wallet.
