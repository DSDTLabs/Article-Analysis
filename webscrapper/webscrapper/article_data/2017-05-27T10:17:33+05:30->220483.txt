AGRA: The Aligarh police has decided to   for surveillance in sensitive areas of the city  , beginning on Friday.
 
  According to police officers, the drones would not only facilitate crowd control but help keep an eye on roofs of houses where miscreants usually stock stones and bricks to foment trouble.
  
  Talking with TOI, SSP, Rajesh Pandey said since several areas in the city are communally sensitive, the drones would be used to identify houses where stones stored on rooftops and cases would be registered against people who indulge in this. He said they had already started using the drones in sensitive areas like Babri Mandi, Dahi wali gali, Phool Bagh, Laria, Uppercoat and Delhi Gate.
  
  The decision was taken after a clash between two groups took place on Wednesday night in Ladai locality, considered a hyper-sensitive area. Both sides indulged in stone-pelting.
  
  The incident was a fallout of a minor accident in which a 10-year-old belonging to the Valmiki community was injured in a collision with a vehicle driven by a Muslim. Members of both communities came to blows and indulged in stone-pelting. The police booked a total of 16 people belonging to both communities.
  
  A week earlier on May 19, tension had heightened in the jewellers’ market at   after shopkeepers had objected to the construction of an additional pillar in a mosque. Local traders backed by some Hindu
  
  organizations staged a protest, saying that the pillar was “endangering” the jewellers’ shops.
  
  As tension mounted, Muslims objected to intervention by Hindu organizations. A heavy police force was deployed in the area to avoid any direct confrontation between the two communities. However, later
  
  people started pelting stone at police but the situation
  
  was controlled. Police said that they had identified person who was leading the mob and had arrested him.
