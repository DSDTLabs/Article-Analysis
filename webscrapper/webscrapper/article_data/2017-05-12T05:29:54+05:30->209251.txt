THANE: More than 1,400 business houses and individual home-buyers across Thane district who collectively owe Rs 1,600 crore to banks and financial institutions will soon lose claim over their mortgaged properties.

 The district administration recently authorized the lenders to attach these assets which can be sold off to recover the bad loans.
 
 Officials in the banking sector told TOI that Thane collector Dr   signed “the final death warrant” for these defaulters after a long legal process which determined all of them as wilful defaulters. The attachment orders against 1,425 defaulters were issued under the Securitisation and   and Enforcement of Security Interests (SARFAESI) Act. Banking expert   said the law has been in place since 2002 and was amended last year after the Vijay Mallya’s mega default.
 
 “In addition to giving security to banks, the SARFAESI law is also in public interest as it is the money of the common citizen which is used to give loans. Any default on the repayment of these loans end up affecting the public,” he explained. The attachment of mortgaged assets began on Monday.
 
 Once sealed, the seized asset is handed over to the bank, which can auction it to recover the outstanding debt. The defaulters have been informed that they can appeal at the   and pay at least half the owed money to save their property and other assets.
