CHENNAI: DMK working president MK   on Wednesday asked the   government to first force health minister C   and DGP TK Rajendran to resign, before blaming the DMK on the gutka factory issue in Coimbatore.

 “If Jayakumar (TN Fisheries minister) gets the DGP and Vijayabhaskar to resign (for their alleged involvement in the gutka scam), I promise to hold a felicitation function honouring Jayakumar,” Stalin said, reacting to Jayakumar accusing a DMK hand behind the functioning of an illegal gutka factory that was raided by the police last week.
 
 “The government has falsely linked the DMK panchayat president and arrested him in this case. A panchayat president can only give building or land approval, but cannot issue a license to operate a factory,” he told reporters.
