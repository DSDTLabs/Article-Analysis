Chandigarh: With constant rise in temperatures, the   of Sukhana Lake has started to drop.

 The water level has gone below 1,157 feet mark from 1,157.40 feet recorded around two weeks back. The highest level in recent years was 1,161.9 feet recorded in September 2017. With no prediction of change in weather in the next week, the water level will further drop.
 
 If the water level dropped below 1,153 feet, weed come on surface, and the lake bed will be visible if the water level drops below 1,150 feet.
 
 With the city receiving good rainfall in last monsoon, which pushed the water level of Sukhna Lake to highest-ever recorded in recent years, the engineering department did not use water of tubewells to fill the man-made lake during the winter.
 
 To address the issue of depleting water level of the lake, the administration on the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court had pumped 20 million gallons of water per day (MGD) of potable water daily into the lake from January 30 to February 28 last year.
 
 When created, the lake had storage capacity of 10.47 million cubic metre (mcm). Between 1958 and 1962, the lake lost more than 20 per cent of its capacity due to heavy silting. The high court had taken suo motu notice of the depletion in water level in 2009 and since then had been monitoring the case. The administration is working on hiring a technical expert for finding solutions to save the lake from drying.
