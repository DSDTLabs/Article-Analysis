NOIDA: The   is building a temporary approach road to the newly constructed bridge over the Hindon river, with Noida’s sectors 112 and 115 on one side and Greater Noida’s Sector 1 and Techzone-4 on the other, officials said on Tuesday.

 The bridge, once opened to traffic, will help commuters travelling to   (west) and Noida’s phase-3 area, which will soon house nearly three lakh residents. Further, once the approach road is ready, the bridge will also be useful for commuters who want to travel from Noida to Greater Noida and  , the officials added. 
 
 The bridge project, which was launched in 2013, has been hanging fire for the last four years or so. While the Greater Noida authorities have completed the part of the bridge on their side, the authorities in Noida are yet to begin work on the project due to hurdles over land acquisition. 
 
 “The project has been stuck for long, so we decided to construct a temporary approach road to improve connectivity,” said M C Tyagi, Project Engineer, Noida Authority. 
 
 The temporary approach is likely to be ready within a couple of weeks.
 
 “The project has been delayed because there are too many curves in the proposed approach road. We will have to realign it. For that, we will have to acquire land, which is a lengthy process. But we are working on it,” he added.
 
 Asked how long it would take for the permanent approach road to be ready, Tyagi said it would all depend on how soon the required land could be acquired.
 
 According to officials, the permanent approach road has to be built between Bisrakh and the bridge. Also, Noida authorities will have to construct a link road between the bridge and   (FNG) expressway, in the vicinity.
 
 Last week, Noida CEO Amit Mohan Prasad visited the area and directed officials to clear all hurdles to expedite the project.
