MAPUSA/BICHOLIM/VASCO
 NCP national president  , on Sunday, took a dig at defence minister   saying the BJP government is unable to safeguard jawans at the borders and hence is incapable of assuring safety to civilians.
 
  “During Parrikar‘s term as defence minister, five times jawans have been attacked. On the other hand,   says he has no worries because he has an excellent defence minister. We are worried as neither the jawans nor the people of our nation are in safe hands,” he said. Pawar said that surgical strikes were held on at least 50 previous occasions, but no defense minister ever boasted about it.
  
  Pawar also taunted Modi saying, “In his speech in Goa Modi said he watches Goa from Delhi, but has he ever done anything to solve its issues like mining?” Earlier in Bicholim, Pawar blamed the BJP government for halting mining operations in the state.
  
  Speaking at Mapusa, party general secretary   said the BJP purposely did not implement the Regional Plan so that they could amass crores of rupees.
