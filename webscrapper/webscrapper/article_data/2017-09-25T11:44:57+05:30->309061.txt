NOIDA: The   (GBU) will soon start a paid vipassana centre which will be open to public. In a meeting with the faculty of the GBU, on Saturday, the Meerut mandal commissioner Prabhat Kumar suggested to the faculty that since the School of Buddhist studies and the Vipassana meditation are the unique selling point (USP) of the varsity, it should start Vipassana modules for one, two, three or 10 days so that the institution can self-finance itself.

 The commissioner who is also the chairman of the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Authority (YEIDA) is handling the charge of the varsity's Vice Chancellor after the retirement of former VC JP Sharma on September 14.
 
 GBU has said that it is working on the project and will formulate a draft for the same by September-end.
 
 “While the GBU is a state-level university, the commissioner noted that it has a low visibility. Since the school of Buddhist Studies which is in its sixth year, is running well, he suggested that a paid Vipassana meditation centre be established here so that additional funds are generated and GBU can invite good publicity too”  , Director, International Relations, GBU told TOI. 
 
 The vipassana centre project will be overseen by Ravinder Pant, working as eminent professor at GBU, who has earlier worked at the   and the Nava Nalanda Mahavihara university.
 
 Further, the commissioner also suggested to the civil engineering department that it should outsource its soil testing facility to outsider agencies.
 
 The department has a facility to carry out soil testing at its laboratory but it is not being outsourced presently.
 
 While the commissioner has asked to prepare a proposal for the facility, a decision on the same will be taken by the university administration in the coming days.
 
 The GBU will also host a one-day chanting session for the Sathipattana, the most widely-known buddist meditation practice by a US-based group on November 5.
