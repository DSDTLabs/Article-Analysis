PATNA: Leader of opposition in state assembly   and other RJD legislators on Friday wore black armbands to express concern over the   order “diluting stringent provisions under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act”.

 The RJD members said the Supreme Court’s order amounted to dilution of the stringent provisions under the Act concerned. After the pre-lunch session of the House, the RJD legislators sat on a dharna in front of the statue of former CM  , who had championed the cause of the SC, ST and extremely backward caste communities of the state. Thakur’s statue is located in the lawn of the state legislature. 
 
 Former minister  , who also sat on dharna, and others said the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre should be held responsible for the SC’s order. They alleged that the central government did not argue the case properly in the apex court, as a result of which the Supreme Court issued the order. They also shouted slogans against the central government and PM  . 
 
 RJD sources said the party did not disrupt the proceedings of the House over the issue as the powers of the legislature as defined by the Constitution and the rules of House business say that court orders cannot be discussed on the floor of the House.
 
 In its Tuesday’s order, the apex court had stated that any complaint made or registered under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act will not lead to immediate arrest of the accused, which could be done only after proper investigation by a DSP rank police officer.
