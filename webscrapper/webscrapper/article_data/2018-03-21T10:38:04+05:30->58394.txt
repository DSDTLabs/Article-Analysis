CHANDIGARH: A day after Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leader   sought action against local government minister Navjot Singh   and his wife for allegedly disclosing the contents of a Special Task Force ( ) report, Sidhu claimed that the report was already out in the media before he released it.

 Talking to media persons during the assembly session, Sidhu said it was the enforcement directorate’s (ED) copy of the report that was submitted to the court in a sealed cover but not Special Task Force (STF). “He (Majithia) should be digging the facts instead jumping to the conclusions. When the STF report was already available with the state advocate general and various television channels running it for hours,” said Sidhu.
 
 Meanwhile, chief minister   said he had not seen the STF report on drug abuse in the state and that the matter was in the high court. He was talking to media persons after first sitting of the budget session of the assembly. He added that the walkout by AAP MLAs during the Governor’s address was unfortunate.
