MUMBAI: A day after the  , the family of   is struggling to rustle up funds for his   Kabra suffered a stroke soon after completing the   on Sunday.

 “He doesn’t have medical insurance and the hospital expenses are going to be extremely heavy for the family. We had to take a loan from a relative to pay the hospital deposit. We have also reached out to race organizers to find out if they can support the family,” said his brother-in-law Amit Somani. Kabra, who is into computer services, lives in Dombivli with his wife and two children.
 
 Around 7.15pm on Monday, Vibhor Pardasani, neurologist at Bombay Hospital, told TOI that the patient was doing well until half an hour back. “But his condition has suddenly deteriorated and we have decided to take him up for surgery right away.” The doctor had earlier mentioned that the patient’s stroke, which left his left side paralysed, did not seem to have any connection with his marathon participation—more so because he is a regular runner.
 
 Kabra has participated in various marathons in the past. “He has been practising regularly for the past five years. He is also into cycling,” said Dr Sudha Patil, a friend who ran with him on Sunday. Kabra finished his race in 1 hour 52 minutes and had collected his medal and snacks before collapsing.
 
 Marathon organizers Procam International has connected the family with the event insurance advisors. “We have an event insurance which covers each person for up to Rs 2 lakh for any hospitalization post stabilization during the race. So when we heard from the family, we held a meeting of the event insurance advisors and the family. While a cashless facility is not available, the family could receive the insurance once out of the hospital,” said Dilip Jayaram, CEO, Procam.
 
 On Monday, the family got a refund of Rs 4,000 paid for ambulance to Bombay Hospital.
