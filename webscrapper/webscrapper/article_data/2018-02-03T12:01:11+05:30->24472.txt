Nagpur: Despite mayor Nanda Jichkar’s order, the Satranjipura zone and public works department are sitting on a proposal to renovate Shanti Nagar crematorium, which is in bad shape.

 Senior Corporator Abha Pande expressed concern over the current condition of the Shanti Nagar crematorium and blamed NMC for the mess. She has threatened agitation if NMC does not start the work in four days.
 
 “This crematorium is in a bad shape and need immediate repairs of pyre platforms, bad roads and other basic facilities,” she said.
 
 She cited that the crematorium has not seen any renovation despite having attained the green nod from the Nagpur Municipal Corporation in 2015 under the regime of former mayor  .
 
 She claimed that the crematorium is full of potholes which results in hampering cremations and other activities. She added that the boundary walls of the yard has been severely affected thereby releasing the hazardous gases into the atmosphere. “People residing near the area find it hard to breathe and they are in distress due to the issue,” a miffed Pande pointed out.
 
 The crematorium was proposed to be renovated in 2015 and Rs35 lakh was allotted to beautify the place but the same could not turn into reality. Irrespective of numerous site visits and inspections from numerous officials did nothing, she claimed.
 
 Today, file is in the Satranjipura zone headed by assistant municipal commissioner Prakash Warade. Still, work has not started yet.
 
 According to Pande, the mayor should look into the issue and pass the work order for the crematorium providing respite to the citizens. The NMC is also going slow to construct LPG-based cremation facility in Shanti Nagar, she said.
 
 In July 2017, standing committee chairman   had given its nod for the purpose as it had received Rs92,36,100 MPLAD fund from former Congress MP   for the facility at Shanti Nagar and Mankapur crematoriums. But this project too failed to start up.
