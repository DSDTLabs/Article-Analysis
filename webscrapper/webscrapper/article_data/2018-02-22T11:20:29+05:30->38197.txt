 The residents of Hinjewadi, Maan, Marunji and Nere — suffering from a lack of good approach roads, water shortage and piling up garbage — have slammed the local gram panchayats.

 “Around 1,000 people have signed the petition. We will submit it to the chief minister after getting 5,000 signatures,” said  , a member of the association.
 
 After the IT park was set up, builders flocked to the region and constructed residential complexes for techies in these three villages and Nere, especially in the last five years.
 
 “These societies are located outside the MIDC areas, so it doesn’t provide any facilities. The gram panchayats too do not provide basic amenities, like roads, water supply, garbage collection, streetlights, footpaths and others. We have faced these problems for five years. Many societies are still coming up and the population will increase by 50,000,” Sinha added.
 
 “These housing societies are located in villages that come under  , but it too doesn’t provide the amenities,” said Kashinath Wange, a resident of Marunji and an association member, “So, we feel that these four villages must be merged into   limits, as we feel it can support such a large population.”
