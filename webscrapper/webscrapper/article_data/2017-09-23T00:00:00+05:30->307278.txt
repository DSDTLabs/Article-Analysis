Actor-filmmaker Salim Kumar’s next movie will be a marked change from his previous directorial, Karutha Judan. The yet-to-be-titled movie will be a “proper entertainer” with   and   in the lead.
 
 The duo, who had earlier teamed up in films such as   and Njanum Ente Familyum, will once again play a couple in the movie, says  , who has also scripted the venture.
  
 “It’s a fun,   movie set against the backdrop of a family. The idea is to tell the story entirely through humour,” he says.
  
 On choosing an entertainer for his directorial, the actor says, “I come from a comedy background and always wanted to do a humour film. However, I have not abandoned serious films, but why stick to a particular pattern all the time.”
  
 The yet-to-be-titled film will go on floors on October 10 in Erattupetta. The movie also has Salim Kumar, Vinayakan, Sreenivasan, Nedumudi Venu, Mammukoya and Suraj Venjaramoodu as part of the cast.
