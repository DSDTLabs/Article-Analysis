LONDON: Members of a gang, which ran a " " and got at least 13 South Asian men married to Lithuanian women to give the men the right to live and work in the UK, were jailed on Wednesday.

 The gang, led by Sainsbury's workers Ayaz Khan, 32, from Pakistan, and Jurgita Pavlovskyte, 25, from Lithuania, got 13 men - 11 from Pakistan, one from India and one from Bangladesh - married to Lithuanian women with EU's citizenship.
