PUNE: The 23.33km   metro rail project moved a step forward with the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority inviting bids from firms for request for qualification. 

 The bidders are expected to submit their proposals by April. Thereafter, the agencies would be shortlisted for tender.
 
 The Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA), chief, Mahesh Zagade said, "The metro project is progressing at a fast pace. We are working on all necessary fronts to avoid any delay. Following the request for qualification, we shall shortlist the agencies for tender. There is a plan to connect the Hinjewadi-Shivajinagar metro route to other routes and even to the ring road to ensure better connectivity."
 
 The PMRDA is implementing the metro project through public private partnership mode on design, build, finance, operate and transfer basis. The metro route is likely to benefit thousands of commuters travelling to Hinjewadi IT Park and adjacent areas. At present, most of them depend on private vehicles because of limited public transport options.
