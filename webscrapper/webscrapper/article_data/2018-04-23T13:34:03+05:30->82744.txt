Since a few years now, the Income   (IT) Department has been making protocols with respect to realty transactions, making it much more stringent. From registering rental agreements with the correct PAN details of the tenant as well as the owner, to deduction of   (tax deducted at source) for monthly rental of Rs 50,000 and above, rules regarding the same have been tightened primarily to make sure black money isn’t generated from this sector.

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes’ (CBDT’s) latest agenda aims at the people who claim huge amounts in the form   (HRA), sometimes using false documents. From June 2017, people who pay monthly rental of Rs 50,000 need to deduct 5 per cent TDS and deposit the same with the I-T department. This TDS trail will act as a proof for those claiming high  . The provision was introduced in the Finance Bill, 2017.
 
 
 
 
 
 Individuals and Hindu Undivided Family (HUFs) who are not required to get their financials audited and are paying rent of more than Rs 50,000 per month have to deduct 5 per cent of the rent paid in a financial year as tax.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For example: if you submit your form 26QC and deposit the tax on April 30, then the last date of furnishing Form 16C is available on www.tdscpc.gov.in and you can download it in 3-7 days after depositing the tax.
 
 
 
 
 
 The tax amount is deducted in the month of March, the last month of the Financial Year. But if the property is being vacated before the year end, tax will be deducted in the last month of the tenancy. The last date of March compliance without interest or penalty amount is April 30.
