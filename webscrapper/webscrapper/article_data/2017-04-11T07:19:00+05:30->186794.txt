Bathinda: Muktsar ADC on Monday started a probed into the gutting of seven ‘birs’ of Guru Granth Sahib at a gurdwara in Aulakh village late on Sunday. 

 Gurdwara Hind di Chaddar at Aulakh in Muktsar district has nine ‘birs.’ One was kept on the gurdwara premises while another was taken to a home of a devotee for prayers and seven were kept in a room. It is alleged that these seven ‘birs’ were damaged in a short circuit, which sparked from a table fan in the room.
 
 Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has ordered a magisterial inquiry and sought report in three days.
 
 Muktsar ADC Lakhmir Singh went to the gurdwara and met the gurdwara committee members and public. He said, “As per villagers and the gurdwara committee members, the fire in the room started due to sparking in a table fan, which damaged the ‘birs.’ As per CCTV footage, no one entered that room where these were kept on a bed and neither any mischief was noticed. I will submit the report in two days after probing the incident.”
