The comedian had already acted in Ajith’s   and   earlier in which they shared a wonderful̥ chemistry on screen. It’s going to be a magical repeat again in   where he plays Ajith’s maternal uncle. The film which is directed by Shiva has got a meaty role for Thambi Ramaiah, as per the reports. Viswasam is a Tamil masala film that features Ajith and Nayanthara in the lead roles. Produced by Sathya Jyothi Films, the film is scheduled to be released on Diwali. A journey which started with Veeram was followed by Vedhalam and Vivegam. Alphabet ‘V’ seems to be a sentiment for the duo.
