LUCKNOW:   had to break little sweat as they swept past   6-0 in their   clash here on Thursday evening.

 With the win, Awadhe Warriors now have won nine out of their 10 matches. Everything seemed to go right for the home side from the word go as their 'trump' girl   overcame Nitchaon Jinda pol of Thailand 14-12, 11-7. The London Olympics bronze medallist had to brave some tough fight in the opening set, before having it easy in the second. After having lost to world No. 2 Carolina Marin in Hyderabad, Saina had some points to prove. And she did it in style. After a sluggish start, the world No. 10 came up with a fine all-round show to quell Jindapon's challenge.
 
 But the highlight of the evening was the lion hearted effort by   to down world No. 2 Jan O Jorgensen of Denmark 11-9, 1113, 11-9. Having earlier lost to Ajay Jayaram of Mumbai, a lot rode on Jorgensen's shoulders. But, Srikanth spoiled the Acers' party with some power-packed smashes and lovely drops.
 
 In the mixed doubles, Warriors' Bodin Issara and Savitree Amitrapai overcame a tough opening set to close out the tie 12-10, 11-5 against Jwala Gutta and Vladimir Ivanov to stretch the lead to 5-0.
