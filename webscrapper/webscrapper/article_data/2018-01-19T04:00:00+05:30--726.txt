Gandhinagar: With the monsoon six months away and summer yet to arrive, the state government has already announced that it will provide farmers irrigation for summer crops after March 15, as water will be reserved for drinking only. 

 The state government anticipates a major water crisis from March itself and the concerned authorities have been told to prepare a contingency plan.
 
 According to records of the state water resources department, as on January 18 the state government has only 50% of total storage capacity available (12,652.55 MCM of 25,239.01 MCM). Sauarashtra, Kutch and south Gujarat have only 44.26%, 22.14% and 49.89% of capacity available, respectively. North Gujarat, after floods and heavy rain has 57.83% of storage capacity while central Gujarat has 72.27%.
 
 Kutch district has only 16.68% of capacity while Amreli has 16.28%, Porbandar 21.11%, Junagadh 25.83%, Botad 26.41%, Surendranagar 33.58%, Jamnagar 38.11%, Devbhumi Dwarka 38.84%, Rajkot 45.99% etc. The Sardar Sarovar dam also has only 45% of its capacity.
 
 A senior officer said, “As there was deficient rain in the last season in Gujarat and the catchment area of the Narmada dam in Madhya Pradesh, water storage at dams in Saurashtra and the Narmada dam are below average. As precaution, the state government has informed farmers that it will not provide irrigation water after March 15. 
 
 Even after keeping water reserved only for drinking, there will be a water shortage in Saurashtra and Kutch and a few other other parts of the state. The government is aware of this and has started planning to manage the crisis. With the shortage of water, there are few options other than regulating reserves for the coming season. Detailed instructions to all concerned state and district authorities will be issued shortly.”
 
 While the state government is under pressure due to the ongoing agrarian crisis, the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd (SSNNL) recently issued a statement saying that considering the scarce reserves of in the Sardar Sarovar dam due to scanty rain in the catchment area, it will not provide irrigation water in the Narmada command area for a summer crop after March 15. 
 
 SSNNL appealed to farmers to not sow a summer crop unless they have a local water source. SSNNL said that the storage level is at 45% of the 15-year average.
