Empowering society through art is the theme that doctor-turned-dancer Dr   chose for her hour-long dance drama titled Indulekha. Being the great granddaughter of the prolific writer  , it was his   that inspired her to conceive the musical.

 Written and directed by  , the show has been choreographed by Samudra Performing Arts with music by  . In the well-crafted stage at Ganesham, Thycaud, in Thiruvananthapuram, the director set the plot as the house of the protagonist. The musical performance told the audience stories of women of five generations of Chandu Menon’s family and how they empowered themselves in the society. 
 
 “Though the novel is known for its progressive ideas, the production is not a page-by-page adaptation of the book,” says Chaithanya, who is a dermatologist settled in Australia. “We conceptualised his thoughts of how women should take care of themselves and be independent in the society. You have to appreciate how the writers’ thoughts are still relevant.”
 Being a trained Mohiniyattom dancer helped her narrate the idea better, she says. On the challenges staging the play, she says, “I had to do justice to the part I play and also make sure the new style of dance production entertains the art enthusiasts.
 
 The show also had live elements such as rain and thunder that gave the audience a unique experience. The play also marks the return of actor and dancer Vineeth Kumar, who had directed Ayaal Njanalla, after a hiatus, in the role of Madhavan, Indulekha’s beau. Chaithanya says that she views the production as a cultural exchange and is now planning to take it to national and international stages.
