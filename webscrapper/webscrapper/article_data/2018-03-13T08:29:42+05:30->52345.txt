PALANPUR: Nearly 150   of Kankrej taluka in Banaskantha have threatened   over  , by the government. 

 In a letter sent to district collector Dilip Rana, the farmers threatened to immolate themselves at the collectorate premises in Palanpur in the first week of April if their demand for compensation for erosion of land due to flood was not met by March 31.
 
 The farmers stated that despite several reminders and request nothing had been done. 
 
 Dinesh Chaudhary, a farmer from Ratangadh, said, “On October 16 last year, we had given a memorandum to the collector bringing to notice about corruption in survey of compensation work for deciding the amount. We personally requested the officials but they turned deaf ears to our pleas.”
 
 “A team of officials comprising gramsevak, revenue talati and a survey team visited the village but they considered just 10 rich farmers who had political backing while poor farmers were ignored,” the letter stated.
