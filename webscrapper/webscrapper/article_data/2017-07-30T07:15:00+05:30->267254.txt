GHAZIABAD: An operations   of   Habitat   (IHC) in Ghaziabad was assaulted on Friday, allegedly after he raised objections to a man, later idenitified as a   employed in the mall itself, smoking in the open area of the mall complex. 

 The victim, Yudhvir Singh (47), was allegedly attacked by nearly 22 men, all bouncers, who barged into his office around 8.40pm on Friday.

 According to police, the attack took place after a guard objected to the bouncer, presumed to be in his 20s, from smoking in the open space generally used for media events.
 
  
  “The man smoking the cigarette slapped the guard when the latter objected. I reached there after being informed on a walky-talky. I slapped the man and asked him to rather use the ‘reserved smoking zone’ of the mall. He apologised and left. However, he arrived a few minutes later with nearly 22 men who thrashed me inside my office. The attack has been captured on CCTV camera,” Singh told TOI.
 
 Singh identified one of the men in the group as Gajender Nagar of Kanawani who has been named as the main accused in the case. Police are examining CCTV footage to identify the other men involved in the assault.
 
 “Investigations have revealed that the men who attacked Singh have been employed as bouncers in the mall. They attacked Singh after one of them was slapped by him,” Indirapuram circle officer DSP Sudesh Gupta told TOI. 
 
 Singh, who received a head injury, was admitted to a hospital.
