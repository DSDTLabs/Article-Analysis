NEW DELHI: Telangana is high on BJP’s wishlist for acquiring new voters ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, and party chief   plans to spend three days in the state from May 23 to 25. Shah will visit Hyderabad and Nalgonda, which may have elected a Congress MP in 2014 and a TDP MP in 2009 but has essentially been a Left stronghold. CPI general secretary Sudhakar Reddy was elected from here in 2004.

 With   aiming to crush the communists, Shah had started his tour of West Bengal from Naxalbari village, the cradle of the Naxalite movement.
 
 Similarly, in Telangana, which has pockets of support for the Left, Shah hopes to make a dent in Nalgonda. While BJP had initially planned to hit out at the ruling TRS during Shah’s visit, the party has changed tack as CM K Chandrasekhar Rao has assured support to BJP’s presidential candidate.
 
 BJP sees a good opportunity to grow in Telangana at this juncture, where it feels a vacuum exists in the opposition space. “With Congress, the main opposition party, almost dysfunctional, it is a good time for us to take up that space,” BJP general secretary Muralidhar Rao, who hails from Telangana and is the party’s in-charge of the southern states, said. Congress, which has governed undivided AP, has been greatly reduced with the bifurcation and a split in the party with YSR Reddy’s son Jaganmohan walking out.
 
 BJP is also organisationally strong in the state. “Cadre strength is high, as seen in mobilisations like the one last month when 12,000 workers went to jail protesting against a legislation to provide reservation for backwards among Muslims,” Rao said. BJP plans to oppose the legislation on the argument that Razakars were the ruling class 70 years ago, so Muslims could not be backward. The party is also looking to make a nationalist pitch about the KCR government not celebrating the day of the state’s accession to the Indian Union on September 17, which BJP plans to celebrate in a big way.
