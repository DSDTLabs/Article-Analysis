MUMBAI: ATM operators say the demand for cash is being spurred by an increase in the average withdrawal size. The average size of a withdrawal in February 2018 was Rs 3,445, up 8% from Rs 3,176 from October 2016, ahead of demonetisation. 

 The number of transactions, however, continues to be lower than pre-demonetisation levels. As against 80.26 crore withdrawals in October 2016, there were only 74.15 crore in January 2018. 
 
 However, the amount withdrawn has increased from Rs 2.54 lakh crore to Rs 2.55 lakh crore due to increases in withdrawal sizes. According to  , MD of   (TCPS), there is no doubt that there is a shortage in some states and it has spread to more states. “Around 10% of our ATMs are running dry. 
 
 The pressure is felt far more in rural areas,” he said. TCPS manages ATM networks for banks and has its own proprietary network. According to  , founder of ATM management firm EPS, there has been a shortage in   and   for two quarters. “It now appears to have spread to  , MP and UP,” he added. 
 
 “One of the latest reasons could be the conversion of Rs 2,000 notes to Rs 200 and emphasis has been on printing lower denomination notes. The cash carrying capacity of ATMs has gone down,” said Radha Rama Dorai, MD of ATM & Allied Services, FIS. 
 
 Bankers say while RBI has stopped printing new Rs 2,000 notes, the ones already printed are being hoarded and not going back into circulation. Also RBI has not been printing additional Rs 2,000 notes.
