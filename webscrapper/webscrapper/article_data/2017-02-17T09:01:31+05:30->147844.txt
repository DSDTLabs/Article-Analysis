SURAT: Soon, commuters in the   will get relief from driving on potholed roads. 

 For the first time, the   (SMC) will be using  , a machine to repair the road pits speedily, across the city. 
 
 The conventional way of road repairs is time consuming, hence the Jetpatcher machine will be used on the city roads getting damaged during the monsoon season, thereby affecting the smooth rides. 
 
 There was no permanent solution to the frequently rising problem of roads getting damaged and affecting the smooth rides. The traditional way of filling the potholes was also not effective and led to further road damages across the city.
 
 As per official estimates, the civic body has been spending over Rs 100 crore to Rs 150 crore for the repairs and re-carpeting of the damaged roads per annum. Despite this, the quality of repairs, being manual, is not giving the desired results to the civic body. 
 
 Official sources said that the Jetpatcher is deployed on a heavy commercial vehicle and can be moved easily from one location to another. 
 
 It carries all the necessary equipment for road repairing. The cleaning of the potholes, primary spraying of emulsion tar, laying the material in the pit and using layers to fill the entire pothole are carried out by single machines, hence it saves working hours.
 
 “The machine can repair the potholes and open up a road in an hour,” said a civic officer from the roads and building department. 
 
 The civic body had invited tenders for the Jetpatcher project and that around four professional institutions had envisaged interest. However, the tender scrutiny committee of the SMC has finalized the lowest bidder from Nagpur. 
 
 “Metros like Mumbai have already been using   to instantly repair the potholes. The technology will help in maintaining the roads for a long period of time,” said the officer.
