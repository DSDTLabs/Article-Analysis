CHANDIGARH: This year, the   government will use Rs 20 crore — half of the money collected through traffic challans — as road safety fund to buy new safety equipment, like speed guns to check accidents. In the last 90 days, the state has witnessed 11 fatal accidents even though fatalities have come down by nearly 16% over the past year.

 
 
  
  
 At a meeting of the road safety council chaired by chief minister  , a threemember led group was formed to formulate a plan of action for targeted spending of the road safety fund to further reduce the accident rate in the state. An amount of Rs 20 crore is available under the fund this year.
 
 As per data compiled by the traffic police, this year witnessed three fatal accidents on the Pathankot-Amritsar-Bathinda-Ganganagar road and two on the   municipal council road. The state has also identified 10 road stretches that are most prone to accidents.
 
 The traffic department has been asked to keep a close tab through special drives in urban areas to check over-speeding and drink driving.   took serious note of the traffic violations that trigger accidents on the road and ordered stringent action against vehicles found moving without proper tail lights. Registration of such vehicles should be cancelled, he said, adding that even tractor trolleys needed to adhere to this rule.
 
 At the meeting, it was pointed out that 400 accidental black spots had been identified across the state. Of these, 150 had been improved by the   and public works department. During 2017, the total number of reported accident cases in the state was 5,997, which resulted in 4,278 causalities – a decline of 15.7% over 2016. The number of people seriously injured in 2017 stood at 4,024. In 2017, highway patrol vehicles and ambulances saved 3,951 lives across the state through prompt evacuation and first aid service.
