PATNA: The Patna-New Delhi   is likely to run at a speed of 130km per hour instead of 110km per hour after getting clearance from the eastern circle of the   (CRS).

 The railways will send a proposal to the CRS soon to inspect the fitness of tracks as well as feasibility to run mail and express trains on the   mainline route on higher speed. The Danapur division of the   (ECR) has already completed track renewal work on the route.
 
 The proposal to run the Rajdhani Express at a higher speed was mooted when ECR GM Lalit Chandra Trivedi along with Danapur DRM Ranjan Prakash Thakur and other senior officials made a surprise inspection of the Patna Junction on Wednesday. During an hourlong inspection, the GM stressed on the need to make the station premises cleaner and asked the officials concerned to get commercial hoardings shifted to other places.
 
 Trivedi expressed satisfaction on the passenger safety measures being adopted at the Patna Junction and also tested the quality of water available on platform number 1.
 
 While inspecting passenger amenities at the Rajendra Nagar Terminal, the GM announced that the front side of the station building would be adorned with ‘Tikuli’ art as part of its beautification work. He also took stock of the overall punctuality of mail and express trains either originating from or passing through the Danapur division.
 
 The GM announced that the railways would replace all conventional rakes with Linke Hofmann Busch ones to ensure safety of passengers. He assured that there would be no scarcity of funds while completing ambitious projects of the ECR in Bihar.
