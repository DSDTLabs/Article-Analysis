After filing his nomination papers, Kamat told reporters he was least worried about the number of candidates contesting against him. 
 
 “Let there be any number of candidates contesting against me. Margao voters have always given me their support and love. This is the seventh time I am contesting from Margao. All those who had rallied behind me during my first elections are still with me in this election, apart from the growing number of new supporters,” Kamat said.
 
 Accusing the BJP-led government of neglecting Margao for the last five years, Kamat said, “It wasunable to bring a single infrastructure development project to the city.
