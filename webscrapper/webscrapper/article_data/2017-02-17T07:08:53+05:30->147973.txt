KOLKATA: The men — all from Ekbalpore and Kidderpore but separated by at least half a km from each other — were arrested from their homes between midnight and 4am for their alleged involvement in   violence on Wednesday. None of them is related to Saika Parvin, the girl whose death sparked the vandalism.

 Rakesh Dhanuk, 25, from Mayurbhanj Road, Jiauddin Sheikh, 26, from of   and MM Ali Road’ Sheikh Sony, 22, were picked up after police spotted them at   footage. “Jiauddin played a key role in leading the mob. He was at the forefront who had breached even a police cordon to enter the ground floor,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar. Joint CP (headquarters), Supratim Sarkar said they were checking crucial CCTV footage of CMRI for more arrests.
 
 Though the violence on Wednesday had escalated beyond control, doctors and staff getting roughed up by local men is not uncommon at the hospital. “We lived in a horror everytime a patient died or his condition worsened after being brought to the hospital, especially if he was from the same locality. But Wednesday’s attack surpassed all instances of violence. I want to quit,” said a hospital employee on Thursday.
 
 Police are checking the history of the three accused men to find out if they were involved in any previous attacks on the hospital or were part of any other clashes in recent times.
 
 “We think it’s an organised attack. The first attack may be an immediate fallout of the death but the second attack came half an hour later. The mob had divided themselves into smaller groups and carried out attacks from different ends,” said an officer.
