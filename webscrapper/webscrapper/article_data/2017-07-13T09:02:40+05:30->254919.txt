CHANDIGARH: Geeta of  , a mother of four, has been   of murdering her   because he came home drunk. Even though the eyewitness—her mother-in-law—and the medical examiner turned hostile, district and sessions judge Balbir Singh delivered a guilty verdict in this 2015 case.

 The text of a police complaint that Shakuntla, Geeta’s mother-in-law, lodged on the day of the   suggests that her son, Satish, was in the habit of coming home drunk and abusing his wife. That day, Geeta had enough, and she brought a dupatta from inside, slung it around the neck of Satish, and dragged him inside with it. Shakunta rushed in after her and found her sitting over Satish’s chest, with a dupatta tied around his neck.
 
 Satish became unconscious and, later, was found dead outside. Geeta blamed it on excessive   but Shakuntla said it was murder. During the trial though, Shakuntla turned hostile. The defence lawyer put up the excessive-drinking theory and pointed out that police had not recovered the body from the victim’s house. The defence also sought to know the source of 24 injury marks on Satish, if he died of strangulation.
 
 The prosecution arguments, all based on the original complaint though, convinced the court that Geeta was guilty of murder. The defence then pleaded for a lenient sentence, since the woman has four children who need care. The quantum of punishment under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) will be pronounced on July 14.
